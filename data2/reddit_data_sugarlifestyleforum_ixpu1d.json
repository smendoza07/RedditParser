    "body": "Ok so some of you have become so horny during lockdowns that you have started approaching other SDs. This guy texted me on reddit, gave me a sob story about his previous SB and then offered me luxuries and riches to be his SB :) \n\nMy flare clearly says Sugar Daddy but now I am thinking that perhaps I should have gone for a more masculine username like 'footlongdong' or 'hardnthick'  or 'hotdaddy' to a avoid this scenario. \n\nAs for SBs, I don't believe for a second when you say it is so difficult to find a SD, I wasn't even looking and I found one, you have competition now. :)\n\nJust posted a link to the chat in messages below.",
