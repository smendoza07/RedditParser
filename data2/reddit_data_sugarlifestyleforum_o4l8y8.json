    "body": "I find it such a waste of time to chat with potentional SDs on SA who balk at the idea of \u201cmutual\u201d benefit. They say things like \u201cI am not ugly\u201d and \u201cI will pay for everything we do\u201d (as long as it is activities he wants to do) and these kinds of men expect intimacy. Stop wasting SB\u2019s time and get off SA. Go to vanilla dating apps.",

When I date someone, we go to nice restaurants, do fun activities, go on cool trips, buy cool things, etc, and I pay for everything. But I don't give them money. Most of the women here would call this a vanilla relationship, but it's far from that. They frown on me using SA because they say I want vanilla, but again, their definition differs from the definition given by the creators of the website.\n\nHonestly it's kind of laughable to come here and say people are using the website incorrectly or for the wrong purpose when the very creators and administrators of the website disagree with you.

Ok, so where are SBs supposed to meet real SDs now? Please let me know. Because currently on SA there are way more men looking for a vanilla relationship than actual SDs. What will stop it from becoming a completely vanilla dating site? Because once it does, all you spoiling bfs will struggle to find a woman there just as much as on Tinder. And yes nobody can stop you from using these sites to find vanilla relationships but you\u2019re making the bowl for SBs so much more difficult because SDs are become impossible to find.

It's the difference between helping my girlfriend and paying my employee. If you want to hand cash payments to a woman and pretend that you have a real relationship and not a structured financial agreement, then hey, long live your self-delusion, but not all of us are that naive.\n\nMy point was no where in the history of sugar dating has \"man pays woman cash on a regular basis\" been advertised as the norm, so I don't see why it's the default expectation. If a woman wants an allowance, let her say so explicitly, not just assume it's what is expected and if she doesn't get it, the guy is some kind of fraud.",

She does not want an allowance because it would make her feel like a prostitute. And she makes good money at her job so she doesn\u2019t really need financial help.

Zero.\n\nTherefore, since the site doesn't do any filtering out or real verification, what you have is a cross section of society where maybe 5% can afford the amounts set out in the allowance thread.\n\nSo...of 100 guys there, 95 simply cannot afford that level of spending.\n\nWhich means you have to be ruthless and not engage at all with anyone who doesn't understand \"mutual benefit\". Otherwise, the 95% of time wasters will drain your energy dry.\n\nThey aren't going to get off SA. You have to block them and move on the second they balk at mutual benefit.",

Many women like to date up / date someone successful. BUT with that being said, I think if you go on their only looking for vanilla and try to guilt / shame someone in to sleeping with you, and all you have to offer is your looks and some dinners out, you will have a hard time finding that. But if you show and are willing to help provide for the woman you are seeking/ with, you may get lucky. BUT it is a catch 22. I just managed to get lucky. But also I approach this like old school traditional dating, like where a man actually helps take care of the woman in his life. Not just guilting someone in to sex for free.",

People were actually posting that she was feeling \"confused, used, and abused\". Then he came back a few days later and said he spoke with her openly and she agreed she didn't want to be paid, just to date him.

            "body": "Your post drew a lot of attention.  Let me add an unusual point of view.  A few months ago I knew nothing about SRs, well virtually nothing, but I stumbled upon a listing on SB which got my attention like nothing I've experienced in years and before I knew it I was learning a whole lot about SRs, largely from comments posted here on Reddit, recommended for my review by my new self-described GF/SB.  It seemed to me at first that there may be a huge variation of SRs.  Can't imagine purely platonic, but it is claimed.  Other SRs I thought were formed around a SB's desire not for merely $ like wages, but instead for fancy dining, exotic vacations, fun or rewarding opportunities and experiences, gifts, and true affection.  No.  It's transactional, or so my first SB instructed me.  Even so I developed strong emotional attachment and she said she did too.  So now I think each SR is a little unique, but the standard formula is that older man pays $X as an allowance or PPM to younger SB, in return for sexual favors.  Period.  That's it.  Am I wrong?  Alternatives to that model are deemed vanilla?  There may be others who are innocently poking around here on Reddit to see what the bowl is all about, and they, we, have no idea at the outset that there are all these rules, expectations, social taboos and mores.  In my case I could easily be paying my SB's mortgage now and significant cost of her cosmetic surgeries, had she played her cards well and simply asked me, instead of constantly canceling on me cause she had a stable of other SDs also paying her, and was also constantly on the prowl looking to be paid for one-night stands from strangers newly met online.  Don't think that good SBs are supposed to do that, but I assure you some SBs do.  It's all about collecting as much quick $ as possible from as many men as possible, regardless of what disappointment, pain and damage is done in the process.  Not sure what the difference is between that and prostitution, and there probably is no difference, though not all SRs operate like that.  Bottom line is that not everyone in this conversation is on the same page; many are taking advantage of others, some are learning, and many are making it up as we discover new information, with plenty of people on both sides of the equation unfortunately getting burned badly and abandoning the bowl while others embrace whatever elements work for their particular needs and desires.  For me, I got burned badly, emotionally and financially, but it could've been so much better or so much worse, so I have no idea where to go from here, probably outside of the bowl, which appears to revolve around selfishness & $$$, rather than selfless love, affection and support for another human being.  You find that elsewhere, if you're very fortunate.  Hopefully someone will tell me I'm wrong.",

The man gets discretion and a more beautiful woman than he could find looking for it in a vanilla setting. Some women treat it like vanilla dating but want/need the sugar. In this case both parties get an emotional caring attachment and get the sugar they seek. I think it can happen, but as it has been stated here, there is a lot of noise to wade through. It is worth the time and effort it in my opinion.",

Most girls on SA are in fact looking for an allowance, something I'm comfortable doing as an SD.\n\nHowever, anywhere from 20-30% of the girls are on SA are not strictly looking for cash. It ranges wildly from \"just want to be treated well\" to looking for a fun experience, or they just broke up with a loser bf where they paid for everything, etc. Or they just heard about SA from a friend and \"want to try it out\". \n\nIf there's attraction and not a crazy age difference, chances are it'll stay in the vanilla world with this type of girl. The problem is that girl is *not* represented on this sub, they simply don't need to post here or ask questions since to them SA it's just a fun excursion from a normal dating site.\n\nThis reality seems to upset A LOT of people here, which I can understand, but from my POV it happens a lot as a 30 something guy.",

Plus I dress more thoughtful, probably closer to how guys in their late 30s dress, and I never talk about or ask for sex, nor do I try to even arrange it. I let things happen more organically even in my sugar relationships which has lead to more opportunities to meet women that were less transactional leading to more SGF SR versus NSA arrangements and more opportunities to meet women that don\u2019t want any allowance or ppm",

She was always grateful and never asked me for money. \n\nLooking back at it I could\u2019ve probably qualified as a SBF. There are women on SA who want that type of spoiled relationship with no allowance . Maybe not ALL of them do, but probably 20-30% do like someone else said.",

They just waste everyone's time.  \n\nFirst off, theyre not wasting everyones time, because there are actually women that aren't looking for allowances. In addition, its much easier to age gap date on SA than Tinder.  \n\n\n>Sa would be so much better without male and female rinsers.\n\nThis I can agree with. But not all men looking for non allowance relationships are rinsers or scammers. Many are completely upfront with what they are looking for, so they aren't doing anything wrong.  \n\n\n>It makes sugar babies more cautious when sa it could be easy for genuine sb and sd.  \n>  \n>Sa should ban sd who don't offer an actual allowance\n\nThey wont do that for a multitude of reasons...\n\n1. Not all sugar relationships come with allowance (never heard of an experience based arrangements?)\n2. SA can't get involved with any he said / she said when it comes to financial matters, its non of their business what 2 people decide to do\n3. SA has slowly moved away from being arrangement based because of Fosta/Sesta",

Did you think that was a new addition or something? Clearly their definition of \"mutually beneficial\" and yours differ.\n\nI'll also say that in this place, the definition of vanilla will vary from the norm as well. When I date someone, we go to nice restaurants, do fun activities, go on cool trips, buy cool things, etc, and I pay for everything. But I don't give them money. Most of the women here would call this a vanilla relationship, but it's far from that. They frown on me using SA because they say I want vanilla, but again, their definition differs from the definition given by the creators of the website.\n\nHonestly it's kind of laughable to come here and say people are using the website incorrectly or for the wrong purpose when the very creators and administrators of the website disagree with you.

Ok, so where are SBs supposed to meet real SDs now? Please let me know. Because currently on SA there are way more men looking for a vanilla relationship than actual SDs. What will stop it from becoming a completely vanilla dating site? Because once it does, all you spoiling bfs will struggle to find a woman there just as much as on Tinder. And yes nobody can stop you from using these sites to find vanilla relationships but you\u2019re making the bowl for SBs so much more difficult because SDs are become impossible to find. I think it could be understood as to why SBs are unhappy about this. Also what you described, to me personally, sounds completely vanilla and like a regular relationship.",

It's the difference between helping my girlfriend and paying my employee. If you want to hand cash payments to a woman and pretend that you have a real relationship and not a structured financial agreement, then hey, long live your self-delusion, but not all of us are that naive.\n\nMy point was no where in the history of sugar dating has \"man pays woman cash on a regular basis\" been advertised as the norm, so I don't see why it's the default expectation. If a woman wants an allowance, let her say so explicitly, not just assume it's what is expected and if she doesn't get it, the guy is some kind of fraud.",

People were actually posting that she was feeling \"confused, used, and abused\". Then he came back a few days later and said he spoke with her openly and she agreed she didn't want to be paid, just to date him. Of course, none of those people came back to apologize for being wrong, and probably still think they are right and she just isn't being honest with him that she wants all his money. \ud83d\ude44",

The man gets discretion and a more beautiful woman than he could find looking for it in a vanilla setting. Some women treat it like vanilla dating but want/need the sugar. In this case both parties get an emotional caring attachment and get the sugar they seek. I think it can happen, but as it has been stated here, there is a lot of noise to wade through. It is worth the time and effort it in my opinion.",

It ranges wildly from \"just want to be treated well\" to looking for a fun experience, or they just broke up with a loser bf where they paid for everything, etc. Or they just heard about SA from a friend and \"want to try it out\". \n\nIf there's attraction and not a crazy age difference, chances are it'll stay in the vanilla world with this type of girl. The problem is that girl is *not* represented on this sub, they simply don't need to post here or ask questions since to them SA it's just a fun excursion from a normal dating site.\n\nThis reality seems to upset A LOT of people here, which I can understand, but from my POV it happens a lot as a 30 something guy.",

They just waste everyone's time.  \n\nFirst off, theyre not wasting everyones time, because there are actually women that aren't looking for allowances. In addition, its much easier to age gap date on SA than Tinder.  \n\n\n>Sa would be so much better without male and female rinsers.\n\nThis I can agree with. But not all men looking for non allowance relationships are rinsers or scammers. Many are completely upfront with what they are looking for, so they aren't doing anything wrong.  \n\n\n>It makes sugar babies more cautious when sa it could be easy for genuine sb and sd.  \n>  \n>Sa should ban sd who don't offer an actual allowance\n\nThey wont do that for a multitude of reasons...\n\n1. Not all sugar relationships come with allowance (never heard of an experience based arrangements?)\n2. SA can't get involved with any he said / she said when it comes to financial matters, its non of their business what 2 people decide to do\n3. SA has slowly moved away from being arrangement based because of Fosta/Sesta",

Did you think that was a new addition or something? Clearly their definition of \"mutually beneficial\" and yours differ.\n\nI'll also say that in this place, the definition of vanilla will vary from the norm as well. When I date someone, we go to nice restaurants, do fun activities, go on cool trips, buy cool things, etc, and I pay for everything. But I don't give them money. Most of the women here would call this a vanilla relationship, but it's far from that. They frown on me using SA because they say I want vanilla, but again, their definition differs from the definition given by the creators of the website.\n\nHonestly it's kind of laughable to come here and say people are using the website incorrectly or for the wrong purpose when the very creators and administrators of the website disagree with you.

Ok, so where are SBs supposed to meet real SDs now? Please let me know. Because currently on SA there are way more men looking for a vanilla relationship than actual SDs. What will stop it from becoming a completely vanilla dating site? Because once it does, all you spoiling bfs will struggle to find a woman there just as much as on Tinder. And yes nobody can stop you from using these sites to find vanilla relationships but you\u2019re making the bowl for SBs so much more difficult because SDs are become impossible to find. I think it could be understood as to why SBs are unhappy about this. Also what you described, to me personally, sounds completely vanilla and like a regular relationship.",

It's the difference between helping my girlfriend and paying my employee. If you want to hand cash payments to a woman and pretend that you have a real relationship and not a structured financial agreement, then hey, long live your self-delusion, but not all of us are that naive.\n\nMy point was no where in the history of sugar dating has \"man pays woman cash on a regular basis\" been advertised as the norm, so I don't see why it's the default expectation. If a woman wants an allowance, let her say so explicitly, not just assume it's what is expected and if she doesn't get it, the guy is some kind of fraud.",

People just ignore them as weird on-offs and pretend they don't really exist.\n\nMy favorite was a guy who just started a relationship from SA and the girl didn't ask him for any money and he came here posting that it seemed like she wanted vanilla but he wasn't sure. People were actually posting that she was feeling \"confused, used, and abused\". Then he came back a few days later and said he spoke with her openly and she agreed she didn't want to be paid, just to date him. Of course, none of those people came back to apologize for being wrong, and probably still think they are right and she just isn't being honest with him that she wants all his money. \ud83d\ude44",

Most girls on SA are in fact looking for an allowance, something I'm comfortable doing as an SD.\n\nHowever, anywhere from 20-30% of the girls are on SA are not strictly looking for cash. It ranges wildly from \"just want to be treated well\" to looking for a fun experience, or they just broke up with a loser bf where they paid for everything, etc. Or they just heard about SA from a friend and \"want to try it out\". \n\nIf there's attraction and not a crazy age difference, chances are it'll stay in the vanilla world with this type of girl. The problem is that girl is *not* represented on this sub, they simply don't need to post here or ask questions since to them SA it's just a fun excursion from a normal dating site.\n\nThis reality seems to upset A LOT of people here, which I can understand, but from my POV it happens a lot as a 30 something guy.",

Did you think that was a new addition or something? Clearly their definition of \"mutually beneficial\" and yours differ.\n\nI'll also say that in this place, the definition of vanilla will vary from the norm as well. When I date someone, we go to nice restaurants, do fun activities, go on cool trips, buy cool things, etc, and I pay for everything. But I don't give them money. Most of the women here would call this a vanilla relationship, but it's far from that. They frown on me using SA because they say I want vanilla, but again, their definition differs from the definition given by the creators of the website.\n\nHonestly it's kind of laughable to come here and say people are using the website incorrectly or for the wrong purpose when the very creators and administrators of the website disagree with you. However, most people here are so arrogant or self-absorbed they truly believe the website agrees with them, and just isn't honest about it for...reasons. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

Ok, so where are SBs supposed to meet real SDs now? Please let me know. Because currently on SA there are way more men looking for a vanilla relationship than actual SDs. What will stop it from becoming a completely vanilla dating site? Because once it does, all you spoiling bfs will struggle to find a woman there just as much as on Tinder. And yes nobody can stop you from using these sites to find vanilla relationships but you\u2019re making the bowl for SBs so much more difficult because SDs are become impossible to find. I think it could be understood as to why SBs are unhappy about this. Also what you described, to me personally, sounds completely vanilla and like a regular relationship.",

It's the difference between helping my girlfriend and paying my employee. If you want to hand cash payments to a woman and pretend that you have a real relationship and not a structured financial agreement, then hey, long live your self-delusion, but not all of us are that naive.\n\nMy point was no where in the history of sugar dating has \"man pays woman cash on a regular basis\" been advertised as the norm, so I don't see why it's the default expectation. If a woman wants an allowance, let her say so explicitly, not just assume it's what is expected and if she doesn't get it, the guy is some kind of fraud.",

She does not want an allowance because it would make her feel like a prostitute. And she makes good money at her job so she doesn\u2019t really need financial help.

SDs and SBs had to choose the range appropriate to them and it was shown on their profile. Now instead of that, the profiles state of most men state \u2018nothing transactional\u2019. Ok, so where are SBs supposed to meet real SDs now? Please let me know. Because currently on SA there are way more men looking for a vanilla relationship than actual SDs. What will stop it from becoming a completely vanilla dating site? Because once it does, all you spoiling bfs will struggle to find a woman there just as much as on Tinder. And yes nobody can stop you from using these sites to find vanilla relationships but you\u2019re making the bowl for SBs so much more difficult because SDs are become impossible to find. I think it could be understood as to why SBs are unhappy about this. Also what you described, to me personally, sounds completely vanilla and like a regular relationship.",

It's the difference between helping my girlfriend and paying my employee. If you want to hand cash payments to a woman and pretend that you have a real relationship and not a structured financial agreement, then hey, long live your self-delusion, but not all of us are that naive.\n\nMy point was no where in the history of sugar dating has \"man pays woman cash on a regular basis\" been advertised as the norm, so I don't see why it's the default expectation. If a woman wants an allowance, let her say so explicitly, not just assume it's what is expected and if she doesn't get it, the guy is some kind of fraud.",

Most girls on SA are in fact looking for an allowance, something I'm comfortable doing as an SD.\n\nHowever, anywhere from 20-30% of the girls are on SA are not strictly looking for cash. It ranges wildly from \"just want to be treated well\" to looking for a fun experience, or they just broke up with a loser bf where they paid for everything, etc. Or they just heard about SA from a friend and \"want to try it out\". \n\nIf there's attraction and not a crazy age difference, chances are it'll stay in the vanilla world with this type of girl. The problem is that girl is *not* represented on this sub, they simply don't need to post here or ask questions since to them SA it's just a fun excursion from a normal dating site.\n\nThis reality seems to upset A LOT of people here, which I can understand, but from my POV it happens a lot as a 30 something guy.",

I let things happen more organically even in my sugar relationships which has lead to more opportunities to meet women that were less transactional leading to more SGF SR versus NSA arrangements and more opportunities to meet women that don\u2019t want any allowance or ppm",

It's the difference between helping my girlfriend and paying my employee. If you want to hand cash payments to a woman and pretend that you have a real relationship and not a structured financial agreement, then hey, long live your self-delusion, but not all of us are that naive.\n\nMy point was no where in the history of sugar dating has \"man pays woman cash on a regular basis\" been advertised as the norm, so I don't see why it's the default expectation. If a woman wants an allowance, let her say so explicitly, not just assume it's what is expected and if she doesn't get it, the guy is some kind of fraud.",

If you are an attractive guy and want to date someone 10-20 years younger than you who is a 10+, it\u2019s always going to be hard because those women are getting guys coming at them all day. One easy way to distinguish yourself from all the other attractive guys, be successful and offer money to get your foot in the door. \n\nPlenty of SDs do just fine on normal dating apps, but if you want to date a younger 10+ attractive woman, you need to set yourself apart",

Most girls on SA are in fact looking for an allowance, something I'm comfortable doing as an SD.\n\nHowever, anywhere from 20-30% of the girls are on SA are not strictly looking for cash. It ranges wildly from \"just want to be treated well\" to looking for a fun experience, or they just broke up with a loser bf where they paid for everything, etc. Or they just heard about SA from a friend and \"want to try it out\". \n\nIf there's attraction and not a crazy age difference, chances are it'll stay in the vanilla world with this type of girl. The problem is that girl is *not* represented on this sub, they simply don't need to post here or ask questions since to them SA it's just a fun excursion from a normal dating site.\n\nThis reality seems to upset A LOT of people here, which I can understand, but from my POV it happens a lot as a 30 something guy.",

It's the difference between helping my girlfriend and paying my employee. If you want to hand cash payments to a woman and pretend that you have a real relationship and not a structured financial agreement, then hey, long live your self-delusion, but not all of us are that naive.\n\nMy point was no where in the history of sugar dating has \"man pays woman cash on a regular basis\" been advertised as the norm, so I don't see why it's the default expectation. If a woman wants an allowance, let her say so explicitly, not just assume it's what is expected and if she doesn't get it, the guy is some kind of fraud.",

Most girls on SA are in fact looking for an allowance, something I'm comfortable doing as an SD.\n\nHowever, anywhere from 20-30% of the girls are on SA are not strictly looking for cash. It ranges wildly from \"just want to be treated well\" to looking for a fun experience, or they just broke up with a loser bf where they paid for everything, etc. Or they just heard about SA from a friend and \"want to try it out\". \n\nIf there's attraction and not a crazy age difference, chances are it'll stay in the vanilla world with this type of girl. The problem is that girl is *not* represented on this sub, they simply don't need to post here or ask questions since to them SA it's just a fun excursion from a normal dating site.\n\nThis reality seems to upset A LOT of people here, which I can understand, but from my POV it happens a lot as a 30 something guy.",

It's the difference between helping my girlfriend and paying my employee. If you want to hand cash payments to a woman and pretend that you have a real relationship and not a structured financial agreement, then hey, long live your self-delusion, but not all of us are that naive.\n\nMy point was no where in the history of sugar dating has \"man pays woman cash on a regular basis\" been advertised as the norm, so I don't see why it's the default expectation. If a woman wants an allowance, let her say so explicitly, not just assume it's what is expected and if she doesn't get it, the guy is some kind of fraud.",

Most girls on SA are in fact looking for an allowance, something I'm comfortable doing as an SD.\n\nHowever, anywhere from 20-30% of the girls are on SA are not strictly looking for cash. It ranges wildly from \"just want to be treated well\" to looking for a fun experience, or they just broke up with a loser bf where they paid for everything, etc. Or they just heard about SA from a friend and \"want to try it out\". \n\nIf there's attraction and not a crazy age difference, chances are it'll stay in the vanilla world with this type of girl. The problem is that girl is *not* represented on this sub, they simply don't need to post here or ask questions since to them SA it's just a fun excursion from a normal dating site.\n\nThis reality seems to upset A LOT of people here, which I can understand, but from my POV it happens a lot as a 30 something guy.",

It's the difference between helping my girlfriend and paying my employee. If you want to hand cash payments to a woman and pretend that you have a real relationship and not a structured financial agreement, then hey, long live your self-delusion, but not all of us are that naive.\n\nMy point was no where in the history of sugar dating has \"man pays woman cash on a regular basis\" been advertised as the norm, so I don't see why it's the default expectation. If a woman wants an allowance, let her say so explicitly, not just assume it's what is expected and if she doesn't get it, the guy is some kind of fraud.",

Most girls on SA are in fact looking for an allowance, something I'm comfortable doing as an SD.\n\nHowever, anywhere from 20-30% of the girls are on SA are not strictly looking for cash. It ranges wildly from \"just want to be treated well\" to looking for a fun experience, or they just broke up with a loser bf where they paid for everything, etc. Or they just heard about SA from a friend and \"want to try it out\". \n\nIf there's attraction and not a crazy age difference, chances are it'll stay in the vanilla world with this type of girl. The problem is that girl is *not* represented on this sub, they simply don't need to post here or ask questions since to them SA it's just a fun excursion from a normal dating site.\n\nThis reality seems to upset A LOT of people here, which I can understand, but from my POV it happens a lot as a 30 something guy.",

If you want to hand cash payments to a woman and pretend that you have a real relationship and not a structured financial agreement, then hey, long live your self-delusion, but not all of us are that naive.\n\nMy point was no where in the history of sugar dating has \"man pays woman cash on a regular basis\" been advertised as the norm, so I don't see why it's the default expectation. If a woman wants an allowance, let her say so explicitly, not just assume it's what is expected and if she doesn't get it, the guy is some kind of fraud.",

Most girls on SA are in fact looking for an allowance, something I'm comfortable doing as an SD.\n\nHowever, anywhere from 20-30% of the girls are on SA are not strictly looking for cash. It ranges wildly from \"just want to be treated well\" to looking for a fun experience, or they just broke up with a loser bf where they paid for everything, etc. Or they just heard about SA from a friend and \"want to try it out\". \n\nIf there's attraction and not a crazy age difference, chances are it'll stay in the vanilla world with this type of girl. The problem is that girl is *not* represented on this sub, they simply don't need to post here or ask questions since to them SA it's just a fun excursion from a normal dating site.\n\nThis reality seems to upset A LOT of people here, which I can understand, but from my POV it happens a lot as a 30 something guy.",

Most girls on SA are in fact looking for an allowance, something I'm comfortable doing as an SD.\n\nHowever, anywhere from 20-30% of the girls are on SA are not strictly looking for cash. It ranges wildly from \"just want to be treated well\" to looking for a fun experience, or they just broke up with a loser bf where they paid for everything, etc. Or they just heard about SA from a friend and \"want to try it out\". \n\nIf there's attraction and not a crazy age difference, chances are it'll stay in the vanilla world with this type of girl. The problem is that girl is *not* represented on this sub, they simply don't need to post here or ask questions since to them SA it's just a fun excursion from a normal dating site.\n\nThis reality seems to upset A LOT of people here, which I can understand, but from my POV it happens a lot as a 30 something guy.",
