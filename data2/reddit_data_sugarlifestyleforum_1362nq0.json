Here's some feedback as it looks like you've discovered that you're profile was set to \"hidden\":\n\nPics\n\n* Main pic: The outfit is solid, I just don't like the camera angle from below looking up at you. Ideally you want the camera facing straight forward instead of tilted.\n* Pic 1: I like the concept and the dress. Unfortunately the lighting isn't ideal. It's good enough for now, but you might consider trying to find a replacement dressed to the nines pic for the future.\n* Pic 2: Only slight is you're wearing big sunglasses. Glad you blurred your license plate.\n* Pic 3: Great pic.\n* Pic 4: You might consider cropping the pic tighter on you so the attention is more on you instead of the background.\n* Pic 5: Great pic.\n* Pic 6: Cute outfit, love the straight hair. Don't really care for the pic from behind. Particularly since your face isn't showing.\n* Pic 7: Stunning pic. The thin top though does make it a bit too revealing imho. You might want to save it to be shared one on one instead of on your profile.\n* Pic 8: Great pic.\n\nText\n\n* Great about me section.\n* I'd move the work remotely bit to the seeking section. \n* Great Seeking section.\n* I'd suggest removing the \"recently\" in the \"Being recently divorced and a part time mom\" as long as it's been more than a few months. Otherwise it might raise a yellow flag for some guys. Particularly since you're looking for a more emotional type arrangement.",

As a fellow mom, my guess is that it probably means something more along the lines that she would like somebody to just treat her to things. Moms don't get to do stuff for ourselves a lot, so even little things are really nice. I mean, that applies to anybody, of course. But moms will often forego things for ourselves to prioritize our kids, whether it be luxury things or even just getting to invest in an interest or hobby. A SR feeds into bringing out what makes us feel like a person and not just a caregiver or homemaker, and that feels like being taken care of. At least, that's what it means when I say it. Lol",

I saw someone suggested pro-actively reaching out, but even that has its limits, many SDs hide their profile.  A couple of other thoughts\n\nPerhaps consider starting a new profile instead of re-activating.  That gets you on scammer radar for a week, but it also gets your profile showing up in search results of legit SDs who sort by new profiles.\n\nA lot of SBs in your area set their location to the major city that's closest to you (you know which city I mean), if they are willing to drive there for dates.  If you're willing to go there, there's many SDs there of course.  The SBs who do this set that city as their location to show up in search results of SDs who only look local, but then say on their profile \"I actually live in Metropolis but open to meeting in Gotham City for the right SD\", or else disclose it early in messaging.  I'm not sure I love this strategy, but it does getting you showing up in more searches, and as long as you're open about your real location early, I don't think it's deceptive.",

As a fellow mom, my guess is that it probably means something more along the lines that she would like somebody to just treat her to things. Moms don't get to do stuff for ourselves a lot, so even little things are really nice. I mean, that applies to anybody, of course. But moms will often forego things for ourselves to prioritize our kids, whether it be luxury things or even just getting to invest in an interest or hobby. A SR feeds into bringing out what makes us feel like a person and not just a caregiver or homemaker, and that feels like being taken care of. At least, that's what it means when I say it. Lol",
