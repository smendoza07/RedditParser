Se Chan came up as a potential candidate and Jessi was extremely against the idea (\u201cNo Se-somethings!\u201d). Similarly when Se Cham was being interviewed for the manger position, he said that he would not be able to work with Jessi, that they would not get along, and that he would need hazard pay for his sanity. \n\nAdditionally during the last RM ep Jessi was on, Se Chan had a discussion with Jessi in the car about how hurt he was during ep 503 because he couldn\u2019t understand English and he felt Jessi got mad at him for that. \n\nI\u2019m glad to see it\u2019s smoothed over now though!",
