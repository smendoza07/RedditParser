If they have no relation then him losing kurama doesn't effect s06p. Now, it does effect him using so6p Chakra with kurama Chakra, but not him using so6p Chakra on its own. Your reasoning is literally the most retarded thing ever. You have no evidence to back it up either, while the other guy does. Doesn't matter if it came before or after losing kurama because the 2 things aren't related. That's like saying sarada can use the mangekyo because Sasuke can't use his renigan.

Flying rajin is just a reverse summoning jutsu.\n\nSo really the only special part of Sasuke\u2019s teleportation is being able to go places outside his reach.

While Sasuke\u2019s Rinnegan teleports anywhere he knows the \u201ccoordinates\u201d of.\n\nAnd they were wanking Kaguya for transporting all of them in a wide range across multiple dimensions far away from their own.

You actually see it moving, and only then does the beam move to hit Naruto\n\nAll in all it takes the beam around 0.5 seconds to reach Naruto.\n\nSo the math is off in every sense of the word.\n\nFor you or anyone to see an actual beam of light move, you would need to slow down the reproduction rate to nanoseconds.\n\nA nanosecond being 1e-9 seconds\n\nIf you only read the Manga then you got no way of knowing if it was light speed or not\n\nBut if you saw the Anime then you know it wasn't a light speed attack because the animation itself shows the bem wasn't moving at light speed\n\nSasuke then goes on to trade w/ naruto after the war, meaning at best hed compare to a tired out naruto which is nowhere near ftl.\n\nThe reason light speed matters is due to this scan\n\n[https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/878097043183255612/908643740904718376/main-qimg-220503c63779007978c700c8afba70cf-lq.png?width=411&height=645](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/878097043183255612/908643740904718376/main-qimg-220503c63779007978c700c8afba70cf-lq.png?width=411&height=645)\n\nThis confirms A is near light speed, which means Sasuke is slower than him due to the math above. If you wanna argue that hes still faster than A due to Naruto scaling to A and Sasuke trading w/ Naruto, you still have his anti feats from Madara.\n\nGive one feat that puts him above A",

If you gave actual reasoning then I might not care and probally would've walked away\n\nThere is no reasoning mate, hence why I'm not claiming to be right. If I had anything to backup backup I'm saying I would've actually tried to get him to agree with me. \n\n> you didn't so I had to come in here\n\nYou didn't HAVE to, u wanted to, which I respect. But I don't get why this is bothering you guys so much\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f It's really not that serious. Let me believe what I want. I will do the same.

Flying rajin is just a reverse summoning jutsu.\n\nSo really the only special part of Sasuke\u2019s teleportation is being able to go places outside his reach.

You actually see it moving, and only then does the beam move to hit Naruto\n\nAll in all it takes the beam around 0.5 seconds to reach Naruto.\n\nSo the math is off in every sense of the word.\n\nFor you or anyone to see an actual beam of light move, you would need to slow down the reproduction rate to nanoseconds.\n\nA nanosecond being 1e-9 seconds\n\nIf you only read the Manga then you got no way of knowing if it was light speed or not\n\nBut if you saw the Anime then you know it wasn't a light speed attack because the animation itself shows the bem wasn't moving at light speed\n\nSasuke then goes on to trade w/ naruto after the war, meaning at best hed compare to a tired out naruto which is nowhere near ftl.\n\nThe reason light speed matters is due to this scan\n\n[https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/878097043183255612/908643740904718376/main-qimg-220503c63779007978c700c8afba70cf-lq.png?width=411&height=645](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/878097043183255612/908643740904718376/main-qimg-220503c63779007978c700c8afba70cf-lq.png?width=411&height=645)\n\nThis confirms A is near light speed, which means Sasuke is slower than him due to the math above. If you wanna argue that hes still faster than A due to Naruto scaling to A and Sasuke trading w/ Naruto, you still have his anti feats from Madara.\n\nGive one feat that puts him above A",

Flying rajin is just a reverse summoning jutsu.\n\nSo really the only special part of Sasuke\u2019s teleportation is being able to go places outside his reach. Since summoning and flying rajin need a mark to be put down at where the teleportation happens. While Sasuke\u2019s Rinnegan teleports anywhere he knows the \u201ccoordinates\u201d of.\n\nAnd they were wanking Kaguya for transporting all of them in a wide range across multiple dimensions far away from their own.

I tbh think Naruto was faster cause in Boruto Sasuke is able to keep up with Naruto only because of his lightning cloak. He wasnt using the lightning cloak in Naruto so Naruto must have been faster than him here. The Shadow Clone sign thing happened while Naruto was in base form. Naruto is definitely faster than Sasuke in KCM form.",

You actually see it moving, and only then does the beam move to hit Naruto\n\nAll in all it takes the beam around 0.5 seconds to reach Naruto.\n\nSo the math is off in every sense of the word.\n\nFor you or anyone to see an actual beam of light move, you would need to slow down the reproduction rate to nanoseconds.\n\nA nanosecond being 1e-9 seconds\n\nIf you only read the Manga then you got no way of knowing if it was light speed or not\n\nBut if you saw the Anime then you know it wasn't a light speed attack because the animation itself shows the bem wasn't moving at light speed\n\nSasuke then goes on to trade w/ naruto after the war, meaning at best hed compare to a tired out naruto which is nowhere near ftl.\n\nThe reason light speed matters is due to this scan\n\n[https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/878097043183255612/908643740904718376/main-qimg-220503c63779007978c700c8afba70cf-lq.png?width=411&height=645](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/878097043183255612/908643740904718376/main-qimg-220503c63779007978c700c8afba70cf-lq.png?width=411&height=645)\n\nThis confirms A is near light speed, which means Sasuke is slower than him due to the math above. If you wanna argue that hes still faster than A due to Naruto scaling to A and Sasuke trading w/ Naruto, you still have his anti feats from Madara.\n\nGive one feat that puts him above A",

I tbh think Naruto was faster cause in Boruto Sasuke is able to keep up with Naruto only because of his lightning cloak. He wasnt using the lightning cloak in Naruto so Naruto must have been faster than him here. The Shadow Clone sign thing happened while Naruto was in base form. Naruto is definitely faster than Sasuke in KCM form.",

You actually see it moving, and only then does the beam move to hit Naruto\n\nAll in all it takes the beam around 0.5 seconds to reach Naruto.\n\nSo the math is off in every sense of the word.\n\nFor you or anyone to see an actual beam of light move, you would need to slow down the reproduction rate to nanoseconds.\n\nA nanosecond being 1e-9 seconds\n\nIf you only read the Manga then you got no way of knowing if it was light speed or not\n\nBut if you saw the Anime then you know it wasn't a light speed attack because the animation itself shows the bem wasn't moving at light speed\n\nSasuke then goes on to trade w/ naruto after the war, meaning at best hed compare to a tired out naruto which is nowhere near ftl.\n\nThe reason light speed matters is due to this scan\n\n[https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/878097043183255612/908643740904718376/main-qimg-220503c63779007978c700c8afba70cf-lq.png?width=411&height=645](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/878097043183255612/908643740904718376/main-qimg-220503c63779007978c700c8afba70cf-lq.png?width=411&height=645)\n\nThis confirms A is near light speed, which means Sasuke is slower than him due to the math above. If you wanna argue that hes still faster than A due to Naruto scaling to A and Sasuke trading w/ Naruto, you still have his anti feats from Madara.\n\nGive one feat that puts him above A",

You actually see it moving, and only then does the beam move to hit Naruto\n\nAll in all it takes the beam around 0.5 seconds to reach Naruto.\n\nSo the math is off in every sense of the word.\n\nFor you or anyone to see an actual beam of light move, you would need to slow down the reproduction rate to nanoseconds.\n\nA nanosecond being 1e-9 seconds\n\nIf you only read the Manga then you got no way of knowing if it was light speed or not\n\nBut if you saw the Anime then you know it wasn't a light speed attack because the animation itself shows the bem wasn't moving at light speed\n\nSasuke then goes on to trade w/ naruto after the war, meaning at best hed compare to a tired out naruto which is nowhere near ftl.\n\nThe reason light speed matters is due to this scan\n\n[https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/878097043183255612/908643740904718376/main-qimg-220503c63779007978c700c8afba70cf-lq.png?width=411&height=645](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/878097043183255612/908643740904718376/main-qimg-220503c63779007978c700c8afba70cf-lq.png?width=411&height=645)\n\nThis confirms A is near light speed, which means Sasuke is slower than him due to the math above. If you wanna argue that hes still faster than A due to Naruto scaling to A and Sasuke trading w/ Naruto, you still have his anti feats from Madara.\n\nGive one feat that puts him above A",

If they have no relation then him losing kurama doesn't effect s06p. Now, it does effect him using so6p Chakra with kurama Chakra, but not him using so6p Chakra on its own. Your reasoning is literally the most retarded thing ever. You have no evidence to back it up either, while the other guy does. Doesn't matter if it came before or after losing kurama because the 2 things aren't related. That's like saying sarada can use the mangekyo because Sasuke can't use his renigan. The 2 aren't related.",

You actually see it moving, and only then does the beam move to hit Naruto\n\nAll in all it takes the beam around 0.5 seconds to reach Naruto.\n\nSo the math is off in every sense of the word.\n\nFor you or anyone to see an actual beam of light move, you would need to slow down the reproduction rate to nanoseconds.\n\nA nanosecond being 1e-9 seconds\n\nIf you only read the Manga then you got no way of knowing if it was light speed or not\n\nBut if you saw the Anime then you know it wasn't a light speed attack because the animation itself shows the bem wasn't moving at light speed\n\nSasuke then goes on to trade w/ naruto after the war, meaning at best hed compare to a tired out naruto which is nowhere near ftl.\n\nThe reason light speed matters is due to this scan\n\n[https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/878097043183255612/908643740904718376/main-qimg-220503c63779007978c700c8afba70cf-lq.png?width=411&height=645](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/878097043183255612/908643740904718376/main-qimg-220503c63779007978c700c8afba70cf-lq.png?width=411&height=645)\n\nThis confirms A is near light speed, which means Sasuke is slower than him due to the math above. If you wanna argue that hes still faster than A due to Naruto scaling to A and Sasuke trading w/ Naruto, you still have his anti feats from Madara.\n\nGive one feat that puts him above A",

If they have no relation then him losing kurama doesn't effect s06p. Now, it does effect him using so6p Chakra with kurama Chakra, but not him using so6p Chakra on its own. Your reasoning is literally the most retarded thing ever. You have no evidence to back it up either, while the other guy does. Doesn't matter if it came before or after losing kurama because the 2 things aren't related. That's like saying sarada can use the mangekyo because Sasuke can't use his renigan.

Spite was the wrong word to use\n\n>I just don't understand his you could come to that conclusion. If you gave actual reasoning then I might not care and probally would've walked away\n\nThere is no reasoning mate, hence why I'm not claiming to be right. If I had anything to backup backup I'm saying I would've actually tried to get him to agree with me. \n\n> you didn't so I had to come in here\n\nYou didn't HAVE to, u wanted to, which I respect. But I don't get why this is bothering you guys so much\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f It's really not that serious. Let me believe what I want. I will do the same. And then we all move on with our days\n\n>Anyway how's your day been?\n\nKinda shit honestly, but I'll live. You?",

Now, it does effect him using so6p Chakra with kurama Chakra, but not him using so6p Chakra on its own. Your reasoning is literally the most retarded thing ever. You have no evidence to back it up either, while the other guy does. Doesn't matter if it came before or after losing kurama because the 2 things aren't related. That's like saying sarada can use the mangekyo because Sasuke can't use his renigan. The 2 aren't related.",

You have no evidence to back it up either, while the other guy does. Doesn't matter if it came before or after losing kurama because the 2 things aren't related. That's like saying sarada can use the mangekyo because Sasuke can't use his renigan. The 2 aren't related.",

You have no evidence to back it up either, while the other guy does. Doesn't matter if it came before or after losing kurama because the 2 things aren't related. That's like saying sarada can use the mangekyo because Sasuke can't use his renigan. The 2 aren't related.",

Now, it does effect him using so6p Chakra with kurama Chakra, but not him using so6p Chakra on its own. Your reasoning is literally the most retarded thing ever. You have no evidence to back it up either, while the other guy does. Doesn't matter if it came before or after losing kurama because the 2 things aren't related. That's like saying sarada can use the mangekyo because Sasuke can't use his renigan. The 2 aren't related.",
