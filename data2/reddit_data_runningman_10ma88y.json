My first impression was these dresses were more suitable for the young.  The very young. Teens/20s.  When I saw those dresses I thought of the era of Bobby Soxers, Judy Garland in Wizard of Oz, etc.  The dresses are very fashion forward or retro depending on your point of view.  But looking at them again through your eyes, I can see older Korean women (30s & 40s) wearing them.  Maybe even some American women in that age bracket.  Well apparently Katiacho's advertising is working. It's got people talking about them all the way across the Pacific.",

My first impression was these dresses were more suitable for the young.  The very young. Teens/20s.  When I saw those dresses I thought of the era of Bobby Soxers, Judy Garland in Wizard of Oz, etc.  The dresses are very fashion forward or retro depending on your point of view.  But looking at them again through your eyes, I can see older Korean women (30s & 40s) wearing them.  Maybe even some American women in that age bracket.  Well apparently Katiacho's advertising is working. It's got people talking about them all the way across the Pacific.",
