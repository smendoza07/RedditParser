I believe that I am judging communism vs socialism based on a neutral understanding of their basic definitions, however I accept that those definitions could be skewed to fit my western ideas of what define them. In my understanding, they are two different ideologies, even though they share similar points, they are not the same. Much in the way Christians and Muslims have similar ideas, but are not the same. However, I'm sure you have been taught different. And it's arrogant of me to assume that I am righteous and infallibly correct. But based on the definition of communism and socialism that I am familiar with, they are two distinct ideologies.

I believe that I am judging communism vs socialism based on a neutral understanding of their basic definitions, however I accept that those definitions could be skewed to fit my western ideas of what define them. In my understanding, they are two different ideologies, even though they share similar points, they are not the same. Much in the way Christians and Muslims have similar ideas, but are not the same. However, I'm sure you have been taught different. And it's arrogant of me to assume that I am righteous and infallibly correct. But based on the definition of communism and socialism that I am familiar with, they are two distinct ideologies.

I believe that I am judging communism vs socialism based on a neutral understanding of their basic definitions, however I accept that those definitions could be skewed to fit my western ideas of what define them. In my understanding, they are two different ideologies, even though they share similar points, they are not the same. Much in the way Christians and Muslims have similar ideas, but are not the same. However, I'm sure you have been taught different. And it's arrogant of me to assume that I am righteous and infallibly correct. But based on the definition of communism and socialism that I am familiar with, they are two distinct ideologies.
