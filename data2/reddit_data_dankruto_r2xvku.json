So the guy says, \u201coh? You want that? Take it!\u201d\n\nHe pushes Naruto down and just fucking hurls it at his head. Then he gets a crowd of people to join in and they all start telling Naruto how much they hate him. Fun guy.\n\nEdit: Here\u2019s the scene in question. Now that I think about it, I think this was part of a small filler three-parter after the Pain arc that is basically just Iruka looking back on his life up to that point and acknowledging how far Naruto has come. It\u2019s actually very wholesome, I\u2019d recommend it.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/POfboUjdpn4",

Hinata has close range attacks to stop chakra, but sakura is faster and is physically stronger so it\u2019s unlike hinata would even touch her . But even if hinata hit a chakra point, kakashi already mentioned sakuras chakra control was better than naruto and sasukes. This doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s stronger than them though, Chakra control is her strong point which is why hinata who stops chakra is no match for her as sakura can control it. \n\nShe\u2019s the only one besides tsunade able to do Strength Of A Hundred Seal and summon Katsuuya, now if we look a tsunade who did those things too, out of all the kages fighting against madara, it\u2019s her strength he was more impressed by, she was the last one conscious and gave her left over strength to heal the other Kages. Say if hinata were to even match her speed and stop a chakra point, sakura\u2019s technique means she stores an abundance of chakra in her seal and can reactivate it in her body, hinata can\u2019t cut of her chakra as she can supply it again and again. Sakura is the same person who got stabbed by madara (as a decoy) and just healed herself from it, the same day sasuke almost died from madaras stab before he was given god-like powers. Hinata would not survive from a stab like that. It\u2019s clear that sakura could end her and would be the last one standing.",

He wanted leaf village to be destroyed only because that would increase his chances of becoming a hokage. He didn't value lives of people. He thought that the people pain slaughtered were merely sacrifices necessary to make him hokage. Also he lead an organisation in which people were taught to bury their feelings. Shinobi were not mere weapons they were people too. Earlier generations may have liked these methods, but that was an era of war. The world changed but Danzo refused to change with it. Why was he even alive this long ! Just fck Danzo all my homies in konoha hate Danzo",

To be treated as a criminal, and being hunted down, only for doing what he thought was right. Mizuki tricked him, told him the real reason why he was hated and ostracized by the villagers. And all the Ninjas of the village jumped at the chance to hunt him down.\n\nBut, the mere fact that Iruka acknowledged Naruto was enough for him to let go of all those dark emotions and bury them deep inside. Iruka's acknowledgement was the single ray of hope that he was looking for through the cloud of darkness that his whole life had been.\n\nReasons why I actually never thought that the Third was a good Hokage by any means and didn't feel bad at all when he died. Naruto had a horrible childhood under his watch.\n\nAnd to this day a part of me wishes that Naruto had destroyed the village. Those people did my boy really dirty. Of course, he got rid of all his demons at the Waterfall of Truth. I never did. So, I still hate all the villagers. \ud83e\udd23",

Then he gets a crowd of people to join in and they all start telling Naruto how much they hate him. Fun guy.\n\nEdit: Here\u2019s the scene in question. Now that I think about it, I think this was part of a small filler three-parter after the Pain arc that is basically just Iruka looking back on his life up to that point and acknowledging how far Naruto has come. It\u2019s actually very wholesome, I\u2019d recommend it.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/POfboUjdpn4",

Hinata has close range attacks to stop chakra, but sakura is faster and is physically stronger so it\u2019s unlike hinata would even touch her . But even if hinata hit a chakra point, kakashi already mentioned sakuras chakra control was better than naruto and sasukes. This doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s stronger than them though, Chakra control is her strong point which is why hinata who stops chakra is no match for her as sakura can control it. \n\nShe\u2019s the only one besides tsunade able to do Strength Of A Hundred Seal and summon Katsuuya, now if we look a tsunade who did those things too, out of all the kages fighting against madara, it\u2019s her strength he was more impressed by, she was the last one conscious and gave her left over strength to heal the other Kages. Say if hinata were to even match her speed and stop a chakra point, sakura\u2019s technique means she stores an abundance of chakra in her seal and can reactivate it in her body, hinata can\u2019t cut of her chakra as she can supply it again and again. Sakura is the same person who got stabbed by madara (as a decoy) and just healed herself from it, the same day sasuke almost died from madaras stab before he was given god-like powers. Hinata would not survive from a stab like that. It\u2019s clear that sakura could end her and would be the last one standing.",

He thought that the people pain slaughtered were merely sacrifices necessary to make him hokage. Also he lead an organisation in which people were taught to bury their feelings. Shinobi were not mere weapons they were people too. Earlier generations may have liked these methods, but that was an era of war. The world changed but Danzo refused to change with it.

Now that I think about it, I think this was part of a small filler three-parter after the Pain arc that is basically just Iruka looking back on his life up to that point and acknowledging how far Naruto has come. It\u2019s actually very wholesome, I\u2019d recommend it.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/POfboUjdpn4",

This doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s stronger than them though, Chakra control is her strong point which is why hinata who stops chakra is no match for her as sakura can control it. \n\nShe\u2019s the only one besides tsunade able to do Strength Of A Hundred Seal and summon Katsuuya, now if we look a tsunade who did those things too, out of all the kages fighting against madara, it\u2019s her strength he was more impressed by, she was the last one conscious and gave her left over strength to heal the other Kages. Say if hinata were to even match her speed and stop a chakra point, sakura\u2019s technique means she stores an abundance of chakra in her seal and can reactivate it in her body, hinata can\u2019t cut of her chakra as she can supply it again and again. Sakura is the same person who got stabbed by madara (as a decoy) and just healed herself from it, the same day sasuke almost died from madaras stab before he was given god-like powers. Hinata would not survive from a stab like that. It\u2019s clear that sakura could end her and would be the last one standing.",

Hinata has close range attacks to stop chakra, but sakura is faster and is physically stronger so it\u2019s unlike hinata would even touch her . But even if hinata hit a chakra point, kakashi already mentioned sakuras chakra control was better than naruto and sasukes. This doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s stronger than them though, Chakra control is her strong point which is why hinata who stops chakra is no match for her as sakura can control it. \n\nShe\u2019s the only one besides tsunade able to do Strength Of A Hundred Seal and summon Katsuuya, now if we look a tsunade who did those things too, out of all the kages fighting against madara, it\u2019s her strength he was more impressed by, she was the last one conscious and gave her left over strength to heal the other Kages. Say if hinata were to even match her speed and stop a chakra point, sakura\u2019s technique means she stores an abundance of chakra in her seal and can reactivate it in her body, hinata can\u2019t cut of her chakra as she can supply it again and again. Sakura is the same person who got stabbed by madara (as a decoy) and just healed herself from it, the same day sasuke almost died from madaras stab before he was given god-like powers. Hinata would not survive from a stab like that. It\u2019s clear that sakura could end her and would be the last one standing.",

Hinata has close range attacks to stop chakra, but sakura is faster and is physically stronger so it\u2019s unlike hinata would even touch her . But even if hinata hit a chakra point, kakashi already mentioned sakuras chakra control was better than naruto and sasukes. This doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s stronger than them though, Chakra control is her strong point which is why hinata who stops chakra is no match for her as sakura can control it. \n\nShe\u2019s the only one besides tsunade able to do Strength Of A Hundred Seal and summon Katsuuya, now if we look a tsunade who did those things too, out of all the kages fighting against madara, it\u2019s her strength he was more impressed by, she was the last one conscious and gave her left over strength to heal the other Kages. Say if hinata were to even match her speed and stop a chakra point, sakura\u2019s technique means she stores an abundance of chakra in her seal and can reactivate it in her body, hinata can\u2019t cut of her chakra as she can supply it again and again. Sakura is the same person who got stabbed by madara (as a decoy) and just healed herself from it, the same day sasuke almost died from madaras stab before he was given god-like powers. Hinata would not survive from a stab like that. It\u2019s clear that sakura could end her and would be the last one standing.",

Hinata has close range attacks to stop chakra, but sakura is faster and is physically stronger so it\u2019s unlike hinata would even touch her . But even if hinata hit a chakra point, kakashi already mentioned sakuras chakra control was better than naruto and sasukes. This doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s stronger than them though, Chakra control is her strong point which is why hinata who stops chakra is no match for her as sakura can control it. \n\nShe\u2019s the only one besides tsunade able to do Strength Of A Hundred Seal and summon Katsuuya, now if we look a tsunade who did those things too, out of all the kages fighting against madara, it\u2019s her strength he was more impressed by, she was the last one conscious and gave her left over strength to heal the other Kages. Say if hinata were to even match her speed and stop a chakra point, sakura\u2019s technique means she stores an abundance of chakra in her seal and can reactivate it in her body, hinata can\u2019t cut of her chakra as she can supply it again and again. Sakura is the same person who got stabbed by madara (as a decoy) and just healed herself from it, the same day sasuke almost died from madaras stab before he was given god-like powers. Hinata would not survive from a stab like that. It\u2019s clear that sakura could end her and would be the last one standing.",
