We wanted to pick up on and meet the expectations of everyone who\u2019s stuck with Dragon Ball so far, along the lines of, \u201cIt\u2019d be neat this happened,\u201d or \u201cI hope this kind of character shows up.\u201d\n\n    And in [V-Jump\u2018s] pages, we have the continuing story of Goku and Vegeta. We\u2019ll see new strong enemies show up, and new stories, and events will continue to progress. Of course Toriyama diligently oversees the storylines for the manga too, so it\u2019s like we have events running in parallel. In terms of timeline placement, we try to not build things in too strictly \u2014 we\u2019d like to leave margins in the story, to allow for a greater degree of freedom.\"\n\nI'm hoping no because it's got a cameo from 21 and she's hard trash.",

Imagine them using perfect susanoo, shinra tensei,fang of light and all of the other countless abilities he has. Also yeah we never got to see juubi Madara use his susanoo,all of his rinnegan abilities and the other abilities he has at his disposal. That was obviously plot because had he used all of his abilities he would have beat team 7 in a few seconds. Like i already said he never went all out and was still keeping up with them and overpowering them so imagine if he did go all out. Like a prime example of that is when Naruto attacks him with the sage art lava style rasenshuriken. That whole scene was obviously done to hype up Naruto's new powers. Madara could done a billion things to counter it. He could have just absorbed it,he could have used shinra tensei,he could have used susanoo and he could have done a billion other things to counter it. But like i said that was obviously plot to hype up Naruto's new powers.",

Baryon mode is one of the most overrated things in the entire Naruto universe. It only worked on isshiki because he had a short life span it won't work against someone like Madara who not only is stronger than isshiki but is also immortal. Since baryon mode doesn't have six paths senjutsu Naruto won't be ale to sense limbo and if you want to make the case that it will be able to sense limbo then fine but still even if baryon mode naruto is able to sense limbo Naruto won't be able to react to limbo just like he couldn't react to it before. The limbo will just keep punching Naruto or they will just use the light fang or they will use the human path to extract Naruto's soul and yes they can do it since limbo have the same abilities as the original. Also Madara will easily be able to match Naruto is taijutsu. He survived against the strongest taijutsu user ever. Naruto's taijutsu is nothing compared to Guy's. Also Madara can just protect himself with the truth seeking orbs which by the way Naruto won't be able to break. Like i said Naruto's taijutsu is nothing compared to Guy's and Guy was barely able to break the truth seeking orbs. These are some of the many ways Madara destroys Naruto. But like i said dual rinnegan juubi Madara is overkill. I would say 1 rinnegan Madara without the 10 tails will also be able to defeat Naruto. This Madara is not immortal but it doesn't matter since baryon mode shaves off life at such a slow rate. Like Naruto punched isshiki so many times and he only managed to shave off like a couple hours of his life \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02. Madara has way way longer to live than that. But even if Madara had a month to live it still wouldn't matter. Naruto would be ale to shave off like an hour from Madara's life. So yeah this Madara also beats him because of limbo and a bunch more things like his experience,the rest of the rinnegan abilities and more.",

Or do you think it would\u2019ve been satisfying if \u201csome dude with a sword\u201d was the the most dangerous villain they ever faced in the series?

Or are you gonna say Hunter x Hunter is about Hunters, or Dragon Ball Z is about Saiyans? The story of Naruto could work just as well and still have the same themes if they were something else, like pirates, spies, or even just in the military. Them being ninjas was not what the story was about. If it were, a lot more time would be spent on the act of actually becoming a ninja. The most impact that the ninja stuff specifically influenced in the story was the the series\u2019 aesthetic. You know, fuedal Japan and all that. \n\nAlso, Hokage does not translate to strongest ninja. Itachi even says something along the lines of \u201cthe Hokage is not one who gains respect, but one who is already respected\u201d. The Hokage is the ninja of the village that is most loved, respected, and trusted with village\u2019s wellbeing. That doesn\u2019t translate the to being the strongest ninja in the village, though that certainly helps. Because if strongest is all that mattered, then Orochimaru would\u2019ve been a prime candidate for Hokage. \n\nFinally, Kaguya isn\u2019t a god, is she? She didn\u2019t really have any god feats. She can\u2019t destroy a planet. Most crazy thing she can do is dimension hopping, which the Rinnegan is already capable of. The closest Naruto gets to gods is in its many mythology references, like Susanoo, or Amaterasu. And there was no ridiculous power jump. Everything that happened in the series was within the realm of the ninjas the series has portrayed. From the very beginning, they were able to do stuff like breath fire, summon beasts, and clone themselves. Hell, the first chapter has a giant demon fox. The series never had strictly realistic ninjas. It always erred on the mystical side of ninjas that you would see in fiction. Saying that it was ever about normal ninjas and then got far away from that is just ignorance. I don\u2019t know what part about sealing a giant demon fox inside a baby, or creating water dragons was realistic to you. And hell, how do they beat Kaguya in the end? That\u2019s right. Using their regular old ninja techniques and sealing her. Stuff that was there from the beginning.",

Like\u2026 how can you watch Dragon Ball Z, and think everything that happens has to do with them being Saiyans? How is Majin Buu relevant to Saiyans at all? Similarly, how can you watch HxH and say that everything that is happening has to due with the main character being Hunters? What did the Phantom Troupe or Chimera Ant arc have to do with that? If anything, being a Hunter just makes things more convenient for the characters. That\u2019s basically most of their reasoning for even being one. \n\nLike, watch. Imagine nobody is a hunter anymore. What does that change besides the Hunter exam, obviously? Gon would still go on his journey to meet his father, and the same enemies and villains would still show up. \n\nSame for the Saiyans. Imagine they can\u2019t transform and can just do what all the other humans can. Besides the transformations (and Saiyan Saga obviously), what does that change? I guess the power levels, but that\u2019s all. The story remains the same. Frieza, Cell, and Buu would still be problems the main characters face off against.\n\nAlso, you failed to give a sufficient rebuttal (and just flat out ignored other stuff I said). What was so grounded about giant demon foxes and summoning giant animals? And what is not grounded, in comparison, about a lady who brought chakra to the world? Can you explain that? You see? When faced with an actual logic answer to this stuff that you can\u2019t just complain about, some of you just resort to saying \u201cIt\u2019s bad because I say so\u201d without giving actual reasons. The sad part about the Naruto fandom being so big is that there are so many people with poor media literacy and analysis skills\u2026 They just latch onto whatever they hear other people say, spread it, and don\u2019t try and actually put any thought into it.",

Hunter x Hunter is a series that is about \u201cThe journey\u201d. I mean look at the manga right now. Gon found Ging, and so he just went home. If it was about being a Hunter, wouldn\u2019t Gon have found a profession in that field and start doing Hunter work? Even Kurapika is doing stuff all in service to his goal of regaining the Kurta eyes. He\u2019s not doing stuff because he\u2019s a Hunter. And look at Killua and Leorio. One is traveling, the other is studying to be a doctor. How exactly is that about being a Hunter? \n\nWow. It saddens me that you\u2019re part of this fandom.

How does Naruto wanting to prove himself and gain respect change? How does Pain wanting to change the world change? How does the wars between the villages change? None of those hinge on the characters being ninjas, how are you this blind? Then being ninjas is just an aesthetic choice. It does not change any character motivations or goals. \n\nOk. Your last paragraph tells me you\u2019re trolling. The story was about stealth, precision, and strategy? Since\u2026 when? Can you tell me events that happened that cause that to be what the show is about? Actually list multiple major events where all of those were pivotal to the plot. Because\u2026 first of all, \u201cstealth, strategy and precision\u201d aren\u2019t things that a show can be about. Those are things that happen in a story, not themes. Naruto didn\u2019t beat the crap out of Mizuki with any of that. Zabuza didn\u2019t die thanks to stealth, strategy, or precision. The series was not about any of that. My word. This fandom is\u2026 geez\u2026 Maybe you should learn basic storytelling before you try and argue what a shows about, yeah?\n\nAlso, how do you think they beat Kaguya? They came up with a strategy to seal her. How old are you where you can\u2019t see this stuff?",

Did you even watch the show? Enemies come to attack Earth, and Goku along with the other Z-fighters fight to protect it. Goku and Vegata do some things that allow the villains to get stronger, but none of the events happen because Goku and Vegeta go looking for a fight. It isn\u2019t until Super where Goku wants to fight anyone and everyone. Unlike you apparently, I actually watched Dragon Ball Z, so I know what I\u2019m talking about.\n\nGing wasn\u2019t missing. Did you notice how he randomly showed up in the story, and nobody made a big deal about it? Nobody but Gon was searching for Ging. He wasn\u2019t missing. He was just traveling, presumably. \n\nIf you would read, you\u2019d see I only mentioned Hokage once, and it wasn\u2019t even in the comment you\u2019re talking about. The series isn\u2019t even about becoming Hokage. I never said that. Also, notice how you don\u2019t have any actual reasoning besides \u201cBecause I said so\u201d? Who do you think is correct here? You, who can\u2019t bring up any actual examples or reasonings? Or me, who has repeatedly brought up facts from the show and have provided reasonings beyond \u201cbecause I said so\u201d?\n\nOy vey. I guess the price of having a huge fandom is that a lot of ignorant people will fester in it. I wonder if this is how bad all big fandoms are\u2026",

Kunai, shuriken, swords. There\u2019s magical aspects to make the story unique like the demon fox, chakra, etc. the biggest thing we see happen in part one  is essentially something destroying small area in a forest. \n\nThe story escalated which is expected. The difference is the jumps aren\u2019t massive. The story leans more on the magic than the ninja stuff but the true ninjas aren\u2019t useless or anything. The first big jump is pain and the susanoo. Pain is closer to a comic book villain than a ninja. He flies, he can bring people back to life, he has weird abilities that are unlike anything seen. It\u2019s fine because pain at the time is like the big bad, you expect him to be absurdly strong. \n\nThen the escalation REALLY starts. Naruto learns to go super saiyan. Madara can pull meteors from orbit and easily 1v5 the kage who were considered the top of the top at the start of the series. Then he becomes a Demi god. Then he gets turned into an actual god who can access other dimensions and destroy entire planets.\n\nThe jumps are insane. One of the main aspects of the show is that they\u2019re ninjas. By turning them into gods, that aspect is lost. A million zabuzas literally couldn\u2019t touch kaguya. That\u2019s what people didn\u2019t like. The origin of the show feels lost because the aspect of being ninjas which was core to the early show, is now meaningless",

None of the villains attacked because Goku and friends were looking for a fight. They attacked because they always were going to. Goku and Vegeta didn\u2019t do anything that\u2019s caused the enemies to start killing people and blow stuff up. Also, even if what you said counted\u2026 how the hell does that make the series about Saiyans? Hell, you yourself could only think of 2 things. That\u2019s enough to be what the whole series is about? 2 things? \n\nFor someone to be missing, that would mean someone has to be looking for them. Otherwise, you can call anyone missing. For example, by your logic, I\u2019m missing, since you don\u2019t know where I am. \n\nNo, what I\u2019m saying is the series is exactly the same even if they aren\u2019t ninjas. Read next time. \n\nI like how you say the story started somewhat grounded, but then proved to mention things that are not grounded at all. I repeat, HOW IS A LITERAL GIANT DEMON FOX GROUNDED? You\u2019re only accepting it because it\u2019s at the beginning, but that right there demolishes your whole point. Naruto has always had mystical and fantastical elements. So it stupid that you\u2019re only fine with the ones that showed up near the beginning.\n\nIn addition to that, you yourself admitted that Pain was more than a ninja. Hmmm\u2026 it\u2019s almost like what I\u2019ve been saying this entire time is true. The series was never about ninja. That\u2019s just the occupation of the characters. It\u2019s what they are. \u201cNinja\u201d does not define what the characters are capable of, because from the very beginning, the series made it known that the ninjas in the series weren\u2019t the realistic kind. They\u2019re the type with powers, and that can seal and summon stuff. What\u2019s \u201cgrounded\u201d about that? Swords, kunai? Sword were still being used during the war, and so were kunai, so what\u2019s your point? \n\nWhen did Naruto go Super Saiyan? I didn\u2019t see him throwing out Ki blasts or throwing energy balls that could destroy the planet. The most he did was make big craters, but I\u2019m pretty sure characters could do that before Naruto. Hell, the 1st Hokage was able to instantly create a mini forest in his first appearance. And there was a jutsu that summoned death himself to rip the souls out of people. That sounds way more crazy than making craters. \n\nMadara did not become a demigod or a god. What counts as a god to you? A god would be someone who can rewrite reality, or destroy the planet with minimal effort. Madara could do neither. What move of Madara\u2019s could destroy the planet? \u201cGod of Shinobi\u201d is title, it\u2019s not literal you know? He has the title along with Hashirama because they were the strongest ninja to have ever lived.\n\nPretty sure I mentioned this already, but I\u2019ll ask you this time. What do you think a ninja is? Explain that, and then I\u2019ll tell you how from the very beginning, Naruto never had those types of ninjas. And what do you mean it was lost? They were still ninjas all the way through. Did you miss the parts where Naruto used shadow clone jutsu all the time? Or all the taijutsu battles? Or\u2026 literally any other Justus that were used? You\u2019re speaking nonsense here. They never stopped being ninjas. And who cares how many Zabuzas it would take to beat Kaguya? How is that relevant at all? So what, you don\u2019t like it because Zabuza isn\u2019t top tier in strength? Is that you\u2019re problem? You\u2019re just a Zabuza fanboy? Because otherwise, I fail to see the issue that an early villain can\u2019t beat an endgame villain.\n\nEdit: You know, I keep proving how nonsense your arguments are, but really, one thing alone demolishes all you have to say. At the beginning, there was a giant 9-tailed fox that had to be sealed away by a man who summoned a giant toad. The fact that you accept that, but you don\u2019t accept villains with strong Justu (notice how I say villains, because people accept Night Guy, despite the fact he almost killed a \u201cso-called\u201d god) destroys any point you have about the series becoming less grounded. And actually, who cares? If you want a grounded story, maybe don\u2019t look towards the series with shadow clones and tailed beasts, eh? I mean, the characters are grounded, but who cares about characters, right? Power levels are all that matters apparently. It doesn\u2019t matter if the characters are motivated by wants and desires. It\u2019s bad because they do big flashy attacks, right? Anyone who tells you that they liked Naruto because the characters were \u201cninjas\u201d is either lying (to you and themselves) or are very shallow. You don\u2019t like a series because of what the characters are. You like it because of who they are, what they go through, and how they react to it all.",

The fight scenes in Jujutsu Kaisen look cool too, yet they aren\u2019t ninjas. Have you ever heard of fight choreography? Besides, there is more to this series than fight scenes. Cool fights aren\u2019t the reason Naruto got as big as it is. At least, they weren\u2019t the sole reason.\n\n2. You said them being ninjas was the driving force, not that it was entertaining. Learn what words mean before you say them next time.\n\n3. People like you make me embarrassed to be part of this fandom. Did you go to school? If you didn\u2019t, then I\u2019m sorry. But if you did, then you really shouldn\u2019t be this bad at media literacy and analysis.",

We wanted to pick up on and meet the expectations of everyone who\u2019s stuck with Dragon Ball so far, along the lines of, \u201cIt\u2019d be neat this happened,\u201d or \u201cI hope this kind of character shows up.\u201d\n\n    And in [V-Jump\u2018s] pages, we have the continuing story of Goku and Vegeta. We\u2019ll see new strong enemies show up, and new stories, and events will continue to progress. Of course Toriyama diligently oversees the storylines for the manga too, so it\u2019s like we have events running in parallel. In terms of timeline placement, we try to not build things in too strictly \u2014 we\u2019d like to leave margins in the story, to allow for a greater degree of freedom.\"\n\nI'm hoping no because it's got a cameo from 21 and she's hard trash.",

Baryon mode is one of the most overrated things in the entire Naruto universe. It only worked on isshiki because he had a short life span it won't work against someone like Madara who not only is stronger than isshiki but is also immortal. Since baryon mode doesn't have six paths senjutsu Naruto won't be ale to sense limbo and if you want to make the case that it will be able to sense limbo then fine but still even if baryon mode naruto is able to sense limbo Naruto won't be able to react to limbo just like he couldn't react to it before. The limbo will just keep punching Naruto or they will just use the light fang or they will use the human path to extract Naruto's soul and yes they can do it since limbo have the same abilities as the original. Also Madara will easily be able to match Naruto is taijutsu. He survived against the strongest taijutsu user ever. Naruto's taijutsu is nothing compared to Guy's. Also Madara can just protect himself with the truth seeking orbs which by the way Naruto won't be able to break. Like i said Naruto's taijutsu is nothing compared to Guy's and Guy was barely able to break the truth seeking orbs. These are some of the many ways Madara destroys Naruto. But like i said dual rinnegan juubi Madara is overkill. I would say 1 rinnegan Madara without the 10 tails will also be able to defeat Naruto. This Madara is not immortal but it doesn't matter since baryon mode shaves off life at such a slow rate. Like Naruto punched isshiki so many times and he only managed to shave off like a couple hours of his life \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02. Madara has way way longer to live than that. But even if Madara had a month to live it still wouldn't matter. Naruto would be ale to shave off like an hour from Madara's life. So yeah this Madara also beats him because of limbo and a bunch more things like his experience,the rest of the rinnegan abilities and more.",

Or are you gonna say Hunter x Hunter is about Hunters, or Dragon Ball Z is about Saiyans? The story of Naruto could work just as well and still have the same themes if they were something else, like pirates, spies, or even just in the military. Them being ninjas was not what the story was about. If it were, a lot more time would be spent on the act of actually becoming a ninja. The most impact that the ninja stuff specifically influenced in the story was the the series\u2019 aesthetic. You know, fuedal Japan and all that. \n\nAlso, Hokage does not translate to strongest ninja. Itachi even says something along the lines of \u201cthe Hokage is not one who gains respect, but one who is already respected\u201d. The Hokage is the ninja of the village that is most loved, respected, and trusted with village\u2019s wellbeing. That doesn\u2019t translate the to being the strongest ninja in the village, though that certainly helps. Because if strongest is all that mattered, then Orochimaru would\u2019ve been a prime candidate for Hokage. \n\nFinally, Kaguya isn\u2019t a god, is she? She didn\u2019t really have any god feats. She can\u2019t destroy a planet. Most crazy thing she can do is dimension hopping, which the Rinnegan is already capable of. The closest Naruto gets to gods is in its many mythology references, like Susanoo, or Amaterasu. And there was no ridiculous power jump. Everything that happened in the series was within the realm of the ninjas the series has portrayed. From the very beginning, they were able to do stuff like breath fire, summon beasts, and clone themselves. Hell, the first chapter has a giant demon fox. The series never had strictly realistic ninjas. It always erred on the mystical side of ninjas that you would see in fiction. Saying that it was ever about normal ninjas and then got far away from that is just ignorance. I don\u2019t know what part about sealing a giant demon fox inside a baby, or creating water dragons was realistic to you. And hell, how do they beat Kaguya in the end? That\u2019s right. Using their regular old ninja techniques and sealing her. Stuff that was there from the beginning.",

How is Majin Buu relevant to Saiyans at all? Similarly, how can you watch HxH and say that everything that is happening has to due with the main character being Hunters? What did the Phantom Troupe or Chimera Ant arc have to do with that? If anything, being a Hunter just makes things more convenient for the characters. That\u2019s basically most of their reasoning for even being one. \n\nLike, watch. Imagine nobody is a hunter anymore. What does that change besides the Hunter exam, obviously? Gon would still go on his journey to meet his father, and the same enemies and villains would still show up. \n\nSame for the Saiyans. Imagine they can\u2019t transform and can just do what all the other humans can. Besides the transformations (and Saiyan Saga obviously), what does that change? I guess the power levels, but that\u2019s all. The story remains the same. Frieza, Cell, and Buu would still be problems the main characters face off against.\n\nAlso, you failed to give a sufficient rebuttal (and just flat out ignored other stuff I said). What was so grounded about giant demon foxes and summoning giant animals? And what is not grounded, in comparison, about a lady who brought chakra to the world? Can you explain that? You see? When faced with an actual logic answer to this stuff that you can\u2019t just complain about, some of you just resort to saying \u201cIt\u2019s bad because I say so\u201d without giving actual reasons. The sad part about the Naruto fandom being so big is that there are so many people with poor media literacy and analysis skills\u2026 They just latch onto whatever they hear other people say, spread it, and don\u2019t try and actually put any thought into it.",

He didn\u2019t say anything about being a Hunter. He said that during the  journey towards your goal, you find things much more important than what you were searching for. Hunter x Hunter is a series that is about \u201cThe journey\u201d. I mean look at the manga right now. Gon found Ging, and so he just went home. If it was about being a Hunter, wouldn\u2019t Gon have found a profession in that field and start doing Hunter work? Even Kurapika is doing stuff all in service to his goal of regaining the Kurta eyes. He\u2019s not doing stuff because he\u2019s a Hunter. And look at Killua and Leorio. One is traveling, the other is studying to be a doctor. How exactly is that about being a Hunter? \n\nWow. It saddens me that you\u2019re part of this fandom. Take away the ninjas, and suddenly the story somehow changes? How does the Uchiha massacre change? How does Sasuke leaving the village due to Itachi\u2019s taunts change? How does Naruto wanting to prove himself and gain respect change? How does Pain wanting to change the world change? How does the wars between the villages change? None of those hinge on the characters being ninjas, how are you this blind? Then being ninjas is just an aesthetic choice. It does not change any character motivations or goals. \n\nOk. Your last paragraph tells me you\u2019re trolling. The story was about stealth, precision, and strategy? Since\u2026 when? Can you tell me events that happened that cause that to be what the show is about? Actually list multiple major events where all of those were pivotal to the plot. Because\u2026 first of all, \u201cstealth, strategy and precision\u201d aren\u2019t things that a show can be about. Those are things that happen in a story, not themes. Naruto didn\u2019t beat the crap out of Mizuki with any of that. Zabuza didn\u2019t die thanks to stealth, strategy, or precision. The series was not about any of that. My word. This fandom is\u2026 geez\u2026 Maybe you should learn basic storytelling before you try and argue what a shows about, yeah?\n\nAlso, how do you think they beat Kaguya? They came up with a strategy to seal her. How old are you where you can\u2019t see this stuff?",

Kunai, shuriken, swords. There\u2019s magical aspects to make the story unique like the demon fox, chakra, etc. the biggest thing we see happen in part one  is essentially something destroying small area in a forest. \n\nThe story escalated which is expected. The difference is the jumps aren\u2019t massive. The story leans more on the magic than the ninja stuff but the true ninjas aren\u2019t useless or anything. The first big jump is pain and the susanoo. Pain is closer to a comic book villain than a ninja. He flies, he can bring people back to life, he has weird abilities that are unlike anything seen. It\u2019s fine because pain at the time is like the big bad, you expect him to be absurdly strong. \n\nThen the escalation REALLY starts. Naruto learns to go super saiyan. Madara can pull meteors from orbit and easily 1v5 the kage who were considered the top of the top at the start of the series. Then he becomes a Demi god. Then he gets turned into an actual god who can access other dimensions and destroy entire planets.\n\nThe jumps are insane. One of the main aspects of the show is that they\u2019re ninjas. By turning them into gods, that aspect is lost. A million zabuzas literally couldn\u2019t touch kaguya. That\u2019s what people didn\u2019t like. The origin of the show feels lost because the aspect of being ninjas which was core to the early show, is now meaningless",

None of the villains attacked because Goku and friends were looking for a fight. They attacked because they always were going to. Goku and Vegeta didn\u2019t do anything that\u2019s caused the enemies to start killing people and blow stuff up. Also, even if what you said counted\u2026 how the hell does that make the series about Saiyans? Hell, you yourself could only think of 2 things. That\u2019s enough to be what the whole series is about? 2 things? \n\nFor someone to be missing, that would mean someone has to be looking for them. Otherwise, you can call anyone missing. For example, by your logic, I\u2019m missing, since you don\u2019t know where I am. \n\nNo, what I\u2019m saying is the series is exactly the same even if they aren\u2019t ninjas. Read next time. \n\nI like how you say the story started somewhat grounded, but then proved to mention things that are not grounded at all. I repeat, HOW IS A LITERAL GIANT DEMON FOX GROUNDED? You\u2019re only accepting it because it\u2019s at the beginning, but that right there demolishes your whole point. Naruto has always had mystical and fantastical elements. So it stupid that you\u2019re only fine with the ones that showed up near the beginning.\n\nIn addition to that, you yourself admitted that Pain was more than a ninja. Hmmm\u2026 it\u2019s almost like what I\u2019ve been saying this entire time is true. The series was never about ninja. That\u2019s just the occupation of the characters. It\u2019s what they are. \u201cNinja\u201d does not define what the characters are capable of, because from the very beginning, the series made it known that the ninjas in the series weren\u2019t the realistic kind. They\u2019re the type with powers, and that can seal and summon stuff. What\u2019s \u201cgrounded\u201d about that? Swords, kunai? Sword were still being used during the war, and so were kunai, so what\u2019s your point? \n\nWhen did Naruto go Super Saiyan? I didn\u2019t see him throwing out Ki blasts or throwing energy balls that could destroy the planet. The most he did was make big craters, but I\u2019m pretty sure characters could do that before Naruto. Hell, the 1st Hokage was able to instantly create a mini forest in his first appearance. And there was a jutsu that summoned death himself to rip the souls out of people. That sounds way more crazy than making craters. \n\nMadara did not become a demigod or a god. What counts as a god to you? A god would be someone who can rewrite reality, or destroy the planet with minimal effort. Madara could do neither. What move of Madara\u2019s could destroy the planet? \u201cGod of Shinobi\u201d is title, it\u2019s not literal you know? He has the title along with Hashirama because they were the strongest ninja to have ever lived.\n\nPretty sure I mentioned this already, but I\u2019ll ask you this time. What do you think a ninja is? Explain that, and then I\u2019ll tell you how from the very beginning, Naruto never had those types of ninjas. And what do you mean it was lost? They were still ninjas all the way through. Did you miss the parts where Naruto used shadow clone jutsu all the time? Or all the taijutsu battles? Or\u2026 literally any other Justus that were used? You\u2019re speaking nonsense here. They never stopped being ninjas. And who cares how many Zabuzas it would take to beat Kaguya? How is that relevant at all? So what, you don\u2019t like it because Zabuza isn\u2019t top tier in strength? Is that you\u2019re problem? You\u2019re just a Zabuza fanboy? Because otherwise, I fail to see the issue that an early villain can\u2019t beat an endgame villain.\n\nEdit: You know, I keep proving how nonsense your arguments are, but really, one thing alone demolishes all you have to say. At the beginning, there was a giant 9-tailed fox that had to be sealed away by a man who summoned a giant toad. The fact that you accept that, but you don\u2019t accept villains with strong Justu (notice how I say villains, because people accept Night Guy, despite the fact he almost killed a \u201cso-called\u201d god) destroys any point you have about the series becoming less grounded. And actually, who cares? If you want a grounded story, maybe don\u2019t look towards the series with shadow clones and tailed beasts, eh? I mean, the characters are grounded, but who cares about characters, right? Power levels are all that matters apparently. It doesn\u2019t matter if the characters are motivated by wants and desires. It\u2019s bad because they do big flashy attacks, right? Anyone who tells you that they liked Naruto because the characters were \u201cninjas\u201d is either lying (to you and themselves) or are very shallow. You don\u2019t like a series because of what the characters are. You like it because of who they are, what they go through, and how they react to it all.",

We\u2019ll see new strong enemies show up, and new stories, and events will continue to progress.

If she just used her Ash killing bones he would have been done for, and she would have won.\n\nAlso we never even got to see Juubi Madara use the Susanoo or much of his Rinnegan techniques. Plus his Limbo clones can do everything he does. Imagine he just decides to spawn a bunch of clones with Susnaoo's but this time he's a 10 tails jinchuriki.",

Imagine them using perfect susanoo, shinra tensei,fang of light and all of the other countless abilities he has. Also yeah we never got to see juubi Madara use his susanoo,all of his rinnegan abilities and the other abilities he has at his disposal. That was obviously plot because had he used all of his abilities he would have beat team 7 in a few seconds. Like i already said he never went all out and was still keeping up with them and overpowering them so imagine if he did go all out. Like a prime example of that is when Naruto attacks him with the sage art lava style rasenshuriken. That whole scene was obviously done to hype up Naruto's new powers. Madara could done a billion things to counter it. He could have just absorbed it,he could have used shinra tensei,he could have used susanoo and he could have done a billion other things to counter it.

Baryon mode is one of the most overrated things in the entire Naruto universe. It only worked on isshiki because he had a short life span it won't work against someone like Madara who not only is stronger than isshiki but is also immortal. Since baryon mode doesn't have six paths senjutsu Naruto won't be ale to sense limbo and if you want to make the case that it will be able to sense limbo then fine but still even if baryon mode naruto is able to sense limbo Naruto won't be able to react to limbo just like he couldn't react to it before. The limbo will just keep punching Naruto or they will just use the light fang or they will use the human path to extract Naruto's soul and yes they can do it since limbo have the same abilities as the original. Also Madara will easily be able to match Naruto is taijutsu. He survived against the strongest taijutsu user ever. Naruto's taijutsu is nothing compared to Guy's. Also Madara can just protect himself with the truth seeking orbs which by the way Naruto won't be able to break. Like i said Naruto's taijutsu is nothing compared to Guy's and Guy was barely able to break the truth seeking orbs. These are some of the many ways Madara destroys Naruto. But like i said dual rinnegan juubi Madara is overkill. I would say 1 rinnegan Madara without the 10 tails will also be able to defeat Naruto. This Madara is not immortal but it doesn't matter since baryon mode shaves off life at such a slow rate. Like Naruto punched isshiki so many times and he only managed to shave off like a couple hours of his life \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02. Madara has way way longer to live than that. But even if Madara had a month to live it still wouldn't matter. Naruto would be ale to shave off like an hour from Madara's life. So yeah this Madara also beats him because of limbo and a bunch more things like his experience,the rest of the rinnegan abilities and more.",

            "body": "No. Just because the characters are ninjas, does not mean the story is about ninjas. Or are you gonna say Hunter x Hunter is about Hunters, or Dragon Ball Z is about Saiyans? The story of Naruto could work just as well and still have the same themes if they were something else, like pirates, spies, or even just in the military. Them being ninjas was not what the story was about. If it were, a lot more time would be spent on the act of actually becoming a ninja. The most impact that the ninja stuff specifically influenced in the story was the the series\u2019 aesthetic. You know, fuedal Japan and all that. \n\nAlso, Hokage does not translate to strongest ninja. Itachi even says something along the lines of \u201cthe Hokage is not one who gains respect, but one who is already respected\u201d. The Hokage is the ninja of the village that is most loved, respected, and trusted with village\u2019s wellbeing. That doesn\u2019t translate the to being the strongest ninja in the village, though that certainly helps. Because if strongest is all that mattered, then Orochimaru would\u2019ve been a prime candidate for Hokage. \n\nFinally, Kaguya isn\u2019t a god, is she? She didn\u2019t really have any god feats. She can\u2019t destroy a planet. Most crazy thing she can do is dimension hopping, which the Rinnegan is already capable of. The closest Naruto gets to gods is in its many mythology references, like Susanoo, or Amaterasu. And there was no ridiculous power jump. Everything that happened in the series was within the realm of the ninjas the series has portrayed. From the very beginning, they were able to do stuff like breath fire, summon beasts, and clone themselves. Hell, the first chapter has a giant demon fox. The series never had strictly realistic ninjas. It always erred on the mystical side of ninjas that you would see in fiction. Saying that it was ever about normal ninjas and then got far away from that is just ignorance. I don\u2019t know what part about sealing a giant demon fox inside a baby, or creating water dragons was realistic to you. And hell, how do they beat Kaguya in the end? That\u2019s right. Using their regular old ninja techniques and sealing her. Stuff that was there from the beginning.",

How is Majin Buu relevant to Saiyans at all? Similarly, how can you watch HxH and say that everything that is happening has to due with the main character being Hunters? What did the Phantom Troupe or Chimera Ant arc have to do with that? If anything, being a Hunter just makes things more convenient for the characters. That\u2019s basically most of their reasoning for even being one. \n\nLike, watch. Imagine nobody is a hunter anymore. What does that change besides the Hunter exam, obviously? Gon would still go on his journey to meet his father, and the same enemies and villains would still show up. \n\nSame for the Saiyans. Imagine they can\u2019t transform and can just do what all the other humans can. Besides the transformations (and Saiyan Saga obviously), what does that change? I guess the power levels, but that\u2019s all. The story remains the same. Frieza, Cell, and Buu would still be problems the main characters face off against.\n\nAlso, you failed to give a sufficient rebuttal (and just flat out ignored other stuff I said). What was so grounded about giant demon foxes and summoning giant animals? And what is not grounded, in comparison, about a lady who brought chakra to the world? Can you explain that? You see? When faced with an actual logic answer to this stuff that you can\u2019t just complain about, some of you just resort to saying \u201cIt\u2019s bad because I say so\u201d without giving actual reasons. The sad part about the Naruto fandom being so big is that there are so many people with poor media literacy and analysis skills\u2026 They just latch onto whatever they hear other people say, spread it, and don\u2019t try and actually put any thought into it.",

Where do the Saiyans come into that? \n\nGing wasn\u2019t missing. Gon was just looking for him. And what did that have to do with being Hunter? Ging flat out says what the series is about. He didn\u2019t say anything about being a Hunter. He said that during the  journey towards your goal, you find things much more important than what you were searching for. Hunter x Hunter is a series that is about \u201cThe journey\u201d. I mean look at the manga right now. Gon found Ging, and so he just went home. If it was about being a Hunter, wouldn\u2019t Gon have found a profession in that field and start doing Hunter work? Even Kurapika is doing stuff all in service to his goal of regaining the Kurta eyes. He\u2019s not doing stuff because he\u2019s a Hunter. And look at Killua and Leorio. One is traveling, the other is studying to be a doctor. How exactly is that about being a Hunter? \n\nWow. It saddens me that you\u2019re part of this fandom. Take away the ninjas, and suddenly the story somehow changes? How does the Uchiha massacre change? How does Sasuke leaving the village due to Itachi\u2019s taunts change? How does Naruto wanting to prove himself and gain respect change? How does Pain wanting to change the world change? How does the wars between the villages change? None of those hinge on the characters being ninjas, how are you this blind? Then being ninjas is just an aesthetic choice. It does not change any character motivations or goals. \n\nOk. Your last paragraph tells me you\u2019re trolling. The story was about stealth, precision, and strategy? Since\u2026 when? Can you tell me events that happened that cause that to be what the show is about? Actually list multiple major events where all of those were pivotal to the plot. Because\u2026 first of all, \u201cstealth, strategy and precision\u201d aren\u2019t things that a show can be about. Those are things that happen in a story, not themes. Naruto didn\u2019t beat the crap out of Mizuki with any of that. Zabuza didn\u2019t die thanks to stealth, strategy, or precision. The series was not about any of that. My word. This fandom is\u2026 geez\u2026 Maybe you should learn basic storytelling before you try and argue what a shows about, yeah?\n\nAlso, how do you think they beat Kaguya? They came up with a strategy to seal her. How old are you where you can\u2019t see this stuff?",

Kunai, shuriken, swords. There\u2019s magical aspects to make the story unique like the demon fox, chakra, etc. the biggest thing we see happen in part one  is essentially something destroying small area in a forest. \n\nThe story escalated which is expected. The difference is the jumps aren\u2019t massive. The story leans more on the magic than the ninja stuff but the true ninjas aren\u2019t useless or anything. The first big jump is pain and the susanoo. Pain is closer to a comic book villain than a ninja. He flies, he can bring people back to life, he has weird abilities that are unlike anything seen. It\u2019s fine because pain at the time is like the big bad, you expect him to be absurdly strong. \n\nThen the escalation REALLY starts. Naruto learns to go super saiyan. Madara can pull meteors from orbit and easily 1v5 the kage who were considered the top of the top at the start of the series. Then he becomes a Demi god. Then he gets turned into an actual god who can access other dimensions and destroy entire planets.\n\nThe jumps are insane. One of the main aspects of the show is that they\u2019re ninjas. By turning them into gods, that aspect is lost. A million zabuzas literally couldn\u2019t touch kaguya. That\u2019s what people didn\u2019t like. The origin of the show feels lost because the aspect of being ninjas which was core to the early show, is now meaningless",

None of the villains attacked because Goku and friends were looking for a fight. They attacked because they always were going to. Goku and Vegeta didn\u2019t do anything that\u2019s caused the enemies to start killing people and blow stuff up. Also, even if what you said counted\u2026 how the hell does that make the series about Saiyans? Hell, you yourself could only think of 2 things. That\u2019s enough to be what the whole series is about? 2 things? \n\nFor someone to be missing, that would mean someone has to be looking for them. Otherwise, you can call anyone missing. For example, by your logic, I\u2019m missing, since you don\u2019t know where I am. \n\nNo, what I\u2019m saying is the series is exactly the same even if they aren\u2019t ninjas. Read next time. \n\nI like how you say the story started somewhat grounded, but then proved to mention things that are not grounded at all. I repeat, HOW IS A LITERAL GIANT DEMON FOX GROUNDED? You\u2019re only accepting it because it\u2019s at the beginning, but that right there demolishes your whole point. Naruto has always had mystical and fantastical elements. So it stupid that you\u2019re only fine with the ones that showed up near the beginning.\n\nIn addition to that, you yourself admitted that Pain was more than a ninja. Hmmm\u2026 it\u2019s almost like what I\u2019ve been saying this entire time is true. The series was never about ninja. That\u2019s just the occupation of the characters. It\u2019s what they are. \u201cNinja\u201d does not define what the characters are capable of, because from the very beginning, the series made it known that the ninjas in the series weren\u2019t the realistic kind. They\u2019re the type with powers, and that can seal and summon stuff. What\u2019s \u201cgrounded\u201d about that? Swords, kunai? Sword were still being used during the war, and so were kunai, so what\u2019s your point? \n\nWhen did Naruto go Super Saiyan? I didn\u2019t see him throwing out Ki blasts or throwing energy balls that could destroy the planet. The most he did was make big craters, but I\u2019m pretty sure characters could do that before Naruto. Hell, the 1st Hokage was able to instantly create a mini forest in his first appearance. And there was a jutsu that summoned death himself to rip the souls out of people. That sounds way more crazy than making craters. \n\nMadara did not become a demigod or a god. What counts as a god to you? A god would be someone who can rewrite reality, or destroy the planet with minimal effort. Madara could do neither. What move of Madara\u2019s could destroy the planet? \u201cGod of Shinobi\u201d is title, it\u2019s not literal you know? He has the title along with Hashirama because they were the strongest ninja to have ever lived.\n\nPretty sure I mentioned this already, but I\u2019ll ask you this time. What do you think a ninja is? Explain that, and then I\u2019ll tell you how from the very beginning, Naruto never had those types of ninjas. And what do you mean it was lost? They were still ninjas all the way through. Did you miss the parts where Naruto used shadow clone jutsu all the time? Or all the taijutsu battles? Or\u2026 literally any other Justus that were used? You\u2019re speaking nonsense here. They never stopped being ninjas. And who cares how many Zabuzas it would take to beat Kaguya? How is that relevant at all? So what, you don\u2019t like it because Zabuza isn\u2019t top tier in strength? Is that you\u2019re problem? You\u2019re just a Zabuza fanboy? Because otherwise, I fail to see the issue that an early villain can\u2019t beat an endgame villain.\n\nEdit: You know, I keep proving how nonsense your arguments are, but really, one thing alone demolishes all you have to say. At the beginning, there was a giant 9-tailed fox that had to be sealed away by a man who summoned a giant toad. The fact that you accept that, but you don\u2019t accept villains with strong Justu (notice how I say villains, because people accept Night Guy, despite the fact he almost killed a \u201cso-called\u201d god) destroys any point you have about the series becoming less grounded. And actually, who cares? If you want a grounded story, maybe don\u2019t look towards the series with shadow clones and tailed beasts, eh? I mean, the characters are grounded, but who cares about characters, right? Power levels are all that matters apparently. It doesn\u2019t matter if the characters are motivated by wants and desires. It\u2019s bad because they do big flashy attacks, right? Anyone who tells you that they liked Naruto because the characters were \u201cninjas\u201d is either lying (to you and themselves) or are very shallow. You don\u2019t like a series because of what the characters are. You like it because of who they are, what they go through, and how they react to it all.",

Baryon mode is one of the most overrated things in the entire Naruto universe. It only worked on isshiki because he had a short life span it won't work against someone like Madara who not only is stronger than isshiki but is also immortal. Since baryon mode doesn't have six paths senjutsu Naruto won't be ale to sense limbo and if you want to make the case that it will be able to sense limbo then fine but still even if baryon mode naruto is able to sense limbo Naruto won't be able to react to limbo just like he couldn't react to it before. The limbo will just keep punching Naruto or they will just use the light fang or they will use the human path to extract Naruto's soul and yes they can do it since limbo have the same abilities as the original. Also Madara will easily be able to match Naruto is taijutsu. He survived against the strongest taijutsu user ever. Naruto's taijutsu is nothing compared to Guy's. Also Madara can just protect himself with the truth seeking orbs which by the way Naruto won't be able to break. Like i said Naruto's taijutsu is nothing compared to Guy's and Guy was barely able to break the truth seeking orbs. These are some of the many ways Madara destroys Naruto. But like i said dual rinnegan juubi Madara is overkill. I would say 1 rinnegan Madara without the 10 tails will also be able to defeat Naruto. This Madara is not immortal but it doesn't matter since baryon mode shaves off life at such a slow rate. Like Naruto punched isshiki so many times and he only managed to shave off like a couple hours of his life \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02. Madara has way way longer to live than that. But even if Madara had a month to live it still wouldn't matter. Naruto would be ale to shave off like an hour from Madara's life. So yeah this Madara also beats him because of limbo and a bunch more things like his experience,the rest of the rinnegan abilities and more.",

How is Majin Buu relevant to Saiyans at all? Similarly, how can you watch HxH and say that everything that is happening has to due with the main character being Hunters? What did the Phantom Troupe or Chimera Ant arc have to do with that? If anything, being a Hunter just makes things more convenient for the characters. That\u2019s basically most of their reasoning for even being one. \n\nLike, watch. Imagine nobody is a hunter anymore. What does that change besides the Hunter exam, obviously? Gon would still go on his journey to meet his father, and the same enemies and villains would still show up. \n\nSame for the Saiyans. Imagine they can\u2019t transform and can just do what all the other humans can. Besides the transformations (and Saiyan Saga obviously), what does that change? I guess the power levels, but that\u2019s all. The story remains the same. Frieza, Cell, and Buu would still be problems the main characters face off against.\n\nAlso, you failed to give a sufficient rebuttal (and just flat out ignored other stuff I said). What was so grounded about giant demon foxes and summoning giant animals? And what is not grounded, in comparison, about a lady who brought chakra to the world? Can you explain that? You see? When faced with an actual logic answer to this stuff that you can\u2019t just complain about, some of you just resort to saying \u201cIt\u2019s bad because I say so\u201d without giving actual reasons. The sad part about the Naruto fandom being so big is that there are so many people with poor media literacy and analysis skills\u2026 They just latch onto whatever they hear other people say, spread it, and don\u2019t try and actually put any thought into it.",

Where do the Saiyans come into that? \n\nGing wasn\u2019t missing. Gon was just looking for him. And what did that have to do with being Hunter? Ging flat out says what the series is about. He didn\u2019t say anything about being a Hunter. He said that during the  journey towards your goal, you find things much more important than what you were searching for. Hunter x Hunter is a series that is about \u201cThe journey\u201d. I mean look at the manga right now. Gon found Ging, and so he just went home. If it was about being a Hunter, wouldn\u2019t Gon have found a profession in that field and start doing Hunter work? Even Kurapika is doing stuff all in service to his goal of regaining the Kurta eyes. He\u2019s not doing stuff because he\u2019s a Hunter. And look at Killua and Leorio. One is traveling, the other is studying to be a doctor. How exactly is that about being a Hunter? \n\nWow. It saddens me that you\u2019re part of this fandom. Take away the ninjas, and suddenly the story somehow changes? How does the Uchiha massacre change? How does Sasuke leaving the village due to Itachi\u2019s taunts change? How does Naruto wanting to prove himself and gain respect change? How does Pain wanting to change the world change? How does the wars between the villages change? None of those hinge on the characters being ninjas, how are you this blind? Then being ninjas is just an aesthetic choice. It does not change any character motivations or goals. \n\nOk. Your last paragraph tells me you\u2019re trolling. The story was about stealth, precision, and strategy? Since\u2026 when? Can you tell me events that happened that cause that to be what the show is about? Actually list multiple major events where all of those were pivotal to the plot. Because\u2026 first of all, \u201cstealth, strategy and precision\u201d aren\u2019t things that a show can be about. Those are things that happen in a story, not themes. Naruto didn\u2019t beat the crap out of Mizuki with any of that. Zabuza didn\u2019t die thanks to stealth, strategy, or precision. The series was not about any of that. My word. This fandom is\u2026 geez\u2026 Maybe you should learn basic storytelling before you try and argue what a shows about, yeah?\n\nAlso, how do you think they beat Kaguya? They came up with a strategy to seal her. How old are you where you can\u2019t see this stuff?",

Missing doesn\u2019t mean people are looking for him, they just don\u2019t know where he is.\n\nSo what you\u2019re saying is the series is exactly the same if the position of hokage doesn\u2019t exist?\n\nLook since you weren\u2019t willing to reread, I\u2019ll walk you through it ONE time.I\u2019m not arguing here, in explaining.\n\nNaruto starts somewhat grounded. Kunai, shuriken, swords. There\u2019s magical aspects to make the story unique like the demon fox, chakra, etc. the biggest thing we see happen in part one  is essentially something destroying small area in a forest. \n\nThe story escalated which is expected. The difference is the jumps aren\u2019t massive. The story leans more on the magic than the ninja stuff but the true ninjas aren\u2019t useless or anything. The first big jump is pain and the susanoo. Pain is closer to a comic book villain than a ninja. He flies, he can bring people back to life, he has weird abilities that are unlike anything seen. It\u2019s fine because pain at the time is like the big bad, you expect him to be absurdly strong. \n\nThen the escalation REALLY starts. Naruto learns to go super saiyan. Madara can pull meteors from orbit and easily 1v5 the kage who were considered the top of the top at the start of the series. Then he becomes a Demi god. Then he gets turned into an actual god who can access other dimensions and destroy entire planets.\n\nThe jumps are insane. One of the main aspects of the show is that they\u2019re ninjas. By turning them into gods, that aspect is lost. A million zabuzas literally couldn\u2019t touch kaguya. That\u2019s what people didn\u2019t like. The origin of the show feels lost because the aspect of being ninjas which was core to the early show, is now meaningless",

None of the villains attacked because Goku and friends were looking for a fight. They attacked because they always were going to. Goku and Vegeta didn\u2019t do anything that\u2019s caused the enemies to start killing people and blow stuff up. Also, even if what you said counted\u2026 how the hell does that make the series about Saiyans? Hell, you yourself could only think of 2 things. That\u2019s enough to be what the whole series is about? 2 things? \n\nFor someone to be missing, that would mean someone has to be looking for them. Otherwise, you can call anyone missing. For example, by your logic, I\u2019m missing, since you don\u2019t know where I am. \n\nNo, what I\u2019m saying is the series is exactly the same even if they aren\u2019t ninjas. Read next time. \n\nI like how you say the story started somewhat grounded, but then proved to mention things that are not grounded at all. I repeat, HOW IS A LITERAL GIANT DEMON FOX GROUNDED? You\u2019re only accepting it because it\u2019s at the beginning, but that right there demolishes your whole point. Naruto has always had mystical and fantastical elements. So it stupid that you\u2019re only fine with the ones that showed up near the beginning.\n\nIn addition to that, you yourself admitted that Pain was more than a ninja. Hmmm\u2026 it\u2019s almost like what I\u2019ve been saying this entire time is true. The series was never about ninja. That\u2019s just the occupation of the characters. It\u2019s what they are. \u201cNinja\u201d does not define what the characters are capable of, because from the very beginning, the series made it known that the ninjas in the series weren\u2019t the realistic kind. They\u2019re the type with powers, and that can seal and summon stuff. What\u2019s \u201cgrounded\u201d about that? Swords, kunai? Sword were still being used during the war, and so were kunai, so what\u2019s your point? \n\nWhen did Naruto go Super Saiyan? I didn\u2019t see him throwing out Ki blasts or throwing energy balls that could destroy the planet. The most he did was make big craters, but I\u2019m pretty sure characters could do that before Naruto. Hell, the 1st Hokage was able to instantly create a mini forest in his first appearance. And there was a jutsu that summoned death himself to rip the souls out of people. That sounds way more crazy than making craters. \n\nMadara did not become a demigod or a god. What counts as a god to you? A god would be someone who can rewrite reality, or destroy the planet with minimal effort. Madara could do neither. What move of Madara\u2019s could destroy the planet? \u201cGod of Shinobi\u201d is title, it\u2019s not literal you know? He has the title along with Hashirama because they were the strongest ninja to have ever lived.\n\nPretty sure I mentioned this already, but I\u2019ll ask you this time. What do you think a ninja is? Explain that, and then I\u2019ll tell you how from the very beginning, Naruto never had those types of ninjas. And what do you mean it was lost? They were still ninjas all the way through. Did you miss the parts where Naruto used shadow clone jutsu all the time? Or all the taijutsu battles? Or\u2026 literally any other Justus that were used? You\u2019re speaking nonsense here. They never stopped being ninjas. And who cares how many Zabuzas it would take to beat Kaguya? How is that relevant at all? So what, you don\u2019t like it because Zabuza isn\u2019t top tier in strength? Is that you\u2019re problem? You\u2019re just a Zabuza fanboy? Because otherwise, I fail to see the issue that an early villain can\u2019t beat an endgame villain.\n\nEdit: You know, I keep proving how nonsense your arguments are, but really, one thing alone demolishes all you have to say. At the beginning, there was a giant 9-tailed fox that had to be sealed away by a man who summoned a giant toad. The fact that you accept that, but you don\u2019t accept villains with strong Justu (notice how I say villains, because people accept Night Guy, despite the fact he almost killed a \u201cso-called\u201d god) destroys any point you have about the series becoming less grounded. And actually, who cares? If you want a grounded story, maybe don\u2019t look towards the series with shadow clones and tailed beasts, eh? I mean, the characters are grounded, but who cares about characters, right? Power levels are all that matters apparently. It doesn\u2019t matter if the characters are motivated by wants and desires. It\u2019s bad because they do big flashy attacks, right? Anyone who tells you that they liked Naruto because the characters were \u201cninjas\u201d is either lying (to you and themselves) or are very shallow. You don\u2019t like a series because of what the characters are. You like it because of who they are, what they go through, and how they react to it all.",

Like i already said he never went all out and was still keeping up with them and overpowering them so imagine if he did go all out. Like a prime example of that is when Naruto attacks him with the sage art lava style rasenshuriken. That whole scene was obviously done to hype up Naruto's new powers. Madara could done a billion things to counter it. He could have just absorbed it,he could have used shinra tensei,he could have used susanoo and he could have done a billion other things to counter it.

Baryon mode is one of the most overrated things in the entire Naruto universe. It only worked on isshiki because he had a short life span it won't work against someone like Madara who not only is stronger than isshiki but is also immortal. Since baryon mode doesn't have six paths senjutsu Naruto won't be ale to sense limbo and if you want to make the case that it will be able to sense limbo then fine but still even if baryon mode naruto is able to sense limbo Naruto won't be able to react to limbo just like he couldn't react to it before. The limbo will just keep punching Naruto or they will just use the light fang or they will use the human path to extract Naruto's soul and yes they can do it since limbo have the same abilities as the original. Also Madara will easily be able to match Naruto is taijutsu. He survived against the strongest taijutsu user ever. Naruto's taijutsu is nothing compared to Guy's. Also Madara can just protect himself with the truth seeking orbs which by the way Naruto won't be able to break. Like i said Naruto's taijutsu is nothing compared to Guy's and Guy was barely able to break the truth seeking orbs. These are some of the many ways Madara destroys Naruto. But like i said dual rinnegan juubi Madara is overkill. I would say 1 rinnegan Madara without the 10 tails will also be able to defeat Naruto. This Madara is not immortal but it doesn't matter since baryon mode shaves off life at such a slow rate. Like Naruto punched isshiki so many times and he only managed to shave off like a couple hours of his life \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02. Madara has way way longer to live than that. But even if Madara had a month to live it still wouldn't matter. Naruto would be ale to shave off like an hour from Madara's life. So yeah this Madara also beats him because of limbo and a bunch more things like his experience,the rest of the rinnegan abilities and more.",

How is Majin Buu relevant to Saiyans at all? Similarly, how can you watch HxH and say that everything that is happening has to due with the main character being Hunters? What did the Phantom Troupe or Chimera Ant arc have to do with that? If anything, being a Hunter just makes things more convenient for the characters. That\u2019s basically most of their reasoning for even being one. \n\nLike, watch. Imagine nobody is a hunter anymore. What does that change besides the Hunter exam, obviously? Gon would still go on his journey to meet his father, and the same enemies and villains would still show up. \n\nSame for the Saiyans. Imagine they can\u2019t transform and can just do what all the other humans can. Besides the transformations (and Saiyan Saga obviously), what does that change? I guess the power levels, but that\u2019s all. The story remains the same. Frieza, Cell, and Buu would still be problems the main characters face off against.\n\nAlso, you failed to give a sufficient rebuttal (and just flat out ignored other stuff I said). What was so grounded about giant demon foxes and summoning giant animals? And what is not grounded, in comparison, about a lady who brought chakra to the world? Can you explain that? You see? When faced with an actual logic answer to this stuff that you can\u2019t just complain about, some of you just resort to saying \u201cIt\u2019s bad because I say so\u201d without giving actual reasons. The sad part about the Naruto fandom being so big is that there are so many people with poor media literacy and analysis skills\u2026 They just latch onto whatever they hear other people say, spread it, and don\u2019t try and actually put any thought into it.",

He didn\u2019t say anything about being a Hunter. He said that during the  journey towards your goal, you find things much more important than what you were searching for. Hunter x Hunter is a series that is about \u201cThe journey\u201d. I mean look at the manga right now. Gon found Ging, and so he just went home. If it was about being a Hunter, wouldn\u2019t Gon have found a profession in that field and start doing Hunter work? Even Kurapika is doing stuff all in service to his goal of regaining the Kurta eyes. He\u2019s not doing stuff because he\u2019s a Hunter. And look at Killua and Leorio. One is traveling, the other is studying to be a doctor. How exactly is that about being a Hunter? \n\nWow. It saddens me that you\u2019re part of this fandom. Take away the ninjas, and suddenly the story somehow changes? How does the Uchiha massacre change? How does Sasuke leaving the village due to Itachi\u2019s taunts change? How does Naruto wanting to prove himself and gain respect change? How does Pain wanting to change the world change? How does the wars between the villages change? None of those hinge on the characters being ninjas, how are you this blind? Then being ninjas is just an aesthetic choice. It does not change any character motivations or goals. \n\nOk. Your last paragraph tells me you\u2019re trolling. The story was about stealth, precision, and strategy? Since\u2026 when? Can you tell me events that happened that cause that to be what the show is about? Actually list multiple major events where all of those were pivotal to the plot. Because\u2026 first of all, \u201cstealth, strategy and precision\u201d aren\u2019t things that a show can be about. Those are things that happen in a story, not themes. Naruto didn\u2019t beat the crap out of Mizuki with any of that. Zabuza didn\u2019t die thanks to stealth, strategy, or precision. The series was not about any of that. My word. This fandom is\u2026 geez\u2026 Maybe you should learn basic storytelling before you try and argue what a shows about, yeah?\n\nAlso, how do you think they beat Kaguya? They came up with a strategy to seal her. How old are you where you can\u2019t see this stuff?",

Kunai, shuriken, swords. There\u2019s magical aspects to make the story unique like the demon fox, chakra, etc. the biggest thing we see happen in part one  is essentially something destroying small area in a forest. \n\nThe story escalated which is expected. The difference is the jumps aren\u2019t massive. The story leans more on the magic than the ninja stuff but the true ninjas aren\u2019t useless or anything. The first big jump is pain and the susanoo. Pain is closer to a comic book villain than a ninja. He flies, he can bring people back to life, he has weird abilities that are unlike anything seen. It\u2019s fine because pain at the time is like the big bad, you expect him to be absurdly strong. \n\nThen the escalation REALLY starts. Naruto learns to go super saiyan. Madara can pull meteors from orbit and easily 1v5 the kage who were considered the top of the top at the start of the series. Then he becomes a Demi god. Then he gets turned into an actual god who can access other dimensions and destroy entire planets.\n\nThe jumps are insane. One of the main aspects of the show is that they\u2019re ninjas. By turning them into gods, that aspect is lost. A million zabuzas literally couldn\u2019t touch kaguya. That\u2019s what people didn\u2019t like. The origin of the show feels lost because the aspect of being ninjas which was core to the early show, is now meaningless",

None of the villains attacked because Goku and friends were looking for a fight. They attacked because they always were going to. Goku and Vegeta didn\u2019t do anything that\u2019s caused the enemies to start killing people and blow stuff up. Also, even if what you said counted\u2026 how the hell does that make the series about Saiyans? Hell, you yourself could only think of 2 things. That\u2019s enough to be what the whole series is about? 2 things? \n\nFor someone to be missing, that would mean someone has to be looking for them. Otherwise, you can call anyone missing. For example, by your logic, I\u2019m missing, since you don\u2019t know where I am. \n\nNo, what I\u2019m saying is the series is exactly the same even if they aren\u2019t ninjas. Read next time. \n\nI like how you say the story started somewhat grounded, but then proved to mention things that are not grounded at all. I repeat, HOW IS A LITERAL GIANT DEMON FOX GROUNDED? You\u2019re only accepting it because it\u2019s at the beginning, but that right there demolishes your whole point. Naruto has always had mystical and fantastical elements. So it stupid that you\u2019re only fine with the ones that showed up near the beginning.\n\nIn addition to that, you yourself admitted that Pain was more than a ninja. Hmmm\u2026 it\u2019s almost like what I\u2019ve been saying this entire time is true. The series was never about ninja. That\u2019s just the occupation of the characters. It\u2019s what they are. \u201cNinja\u201d does not define what the characters are capable of, because from the very beginning, the series made it known that the ninjas in the series weren\u2019t the realistic kind. They\u2019re the type with powers, and that can seal and summon stuff. What\u2019s \u201cgrounded\u201d about that? Swords, kunai? Sword were still being used during the war, and so were kunai, so what\u2019s your point? \n\nWhen did Naruto go Super Saiyan? I didn\u2019t see him throwing out Ki blasts or throwing energy balls that could destroy the planet. The most he did was make big craters, but I\u2019m pretty sure characters could do that before Naruto. Hell, the 1st Hokage was able to instantly create a mini forest in his first appearance. And there was a jutsu that summoned death himself to rip the souls out of people. That sounds way more crazy than making craters. \n\nMadara did not become a demigod or a god. What counts as a god to you? A god would be someone who can rewrite reality, or destroy the planet with minimal effort. Madara could do neither. What move of Madara\u2019s could destroy the planet? \u201cGod of Shinobi\u201d is title, it\u2019s not literal you know? He has the title along with Hashirama because they were the strongest ninja to have ever lived.\n\nPretty sure I mentioned this already, but I\u2019ll ask you this time. What do you think a ninja is? Explain that, and then I\u2019ll tell you how from the very beginning, Naruto never had those types of ninjas. And what do you mean it was lost? They were still ninjas all the way through. Did you miss the parts where Naruto used shadow clone jutsu all the time? Or all the taijutsu battles? Or\u2026 literally any other Justus that were used? You\u2019re speaking nonsense here. They never stopped being ninjas. And who cares how many Zabuzas it would take to beat Kaguya? How is that relevant at all? So what, you don\u2019t like it because Zabuza isn\u2019t top tier in strength? Is that you\u2019re problem? You\u2019re just a Zabuza fanboy? Because otherwise, I fail to see the issue that an early villain can\u2019t beat an endgame villain.\n\nEdit: You know, I keep proving how nonsense your arguments are, but really, one thing alone demolishes all you have to say. At the beginning, there was a giant 9-tailed fox that had to be sealed away by a man who summoned a giant toad. The fact that you accept that, but you don\u2019t accept villains with strong Justu (notice how I say villains, because people accept Night Guy, despite the fact he almost killed a \u201cso-called\u201d god) destroys any point you have about the series becoming less grounded. And actually, who cares? If you want a grounded story, maybe don\u2019t look towards the series with shadow clones and tailed beasts, eh? I mean, the characters are grounded, but who cares about characters, right? Power levels are all that matters apparently. It doesn\u2019t matter if the characters are motivated by wants and desires. It\u2019s bad because they do big flashy attacks, right? Anyone who tells you that they liked Naruto because the characters were \u201cninjas\u201d is either lying (to you and themselves) or are very shallow. You don\u2019t like a series because of what the characters are. You like it because of who they are, what they go through, and how they react to it all.",

That was obviously plot because had he used all of his abilities he would have beat team 7 in a few seconds. Like i already said he never went all out and was still keeping up with them and overpowering them so imagine if he did go all out. Like a prime example of that is when Naruto attacks him with the sage art lava style rasenshuriken. That whole scene was obviously done to hype up Naruto's new powers. Madara could done a billion things to counter it. He could have just absorbed it,he could have used shinra tensei,he could have used susanoo and he could have done a billion other things to counter it.

Baryon mode is one of the most overrated things in the entire Naruto universe. It only worked on isshiki because he had a short life span it won't work against someone like Madara who not only is stronger than isshiki but is also immortal. Since baryon mode doesn't have six paths senjutsu Naruto won't be ale to sense limbo and if you want to make the case that it will be able to sense limbo then fine but still even if baryon mode naruto is able to sense limbo Naruto won't be able to react to limbo just like he couldn't react to it before. The limbo will just keep punching Naruto or they will just use the light fang or they will use the human path to extract Naruto's soul and yes they can do it since limbo have the same abilities as the original. Also Madara will easily be able to match Naruto is taijutsu. He survived against the strongest taijutsu user ever. Naruto's taijutsu is nothing compared to Guy's. Also Madara can just protect himself with the truth seeking orbs which by the way Naruto won't be able to break. Like i said Naruto's taijutsu is nothing compared to Guy's and Guy was barely able to break the truth seeking orbs. These are some of the many ways Madara destroys Naruto. But like i said dual rinnegan juubi Madara is overkill. I would say 1 rinnegan Madara without the 10 tails will also be able to defeat Naruto. This Madara is not immortal but it doesn't matter since baryon mode shaves off life at such a slow rate. Like Naruto punched isshiki so many times and he only managed to shave off like a couple hours of his life \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02. Madara has way way longer to live than that. But even if Madara had a month to live it still wouldn't matter. Naruto would be ale to shave off like an hour from Madara's life. So yeah this Madara also beats him because of limbo and a bunch more things like his experience,the rest of the rinnegan abilities and more.",

Hunter x Hunter is a series that is about \u201cThe journey\u201d. I mean look at the manga right now. Gon found Ging, and so he just went home.

Even Kurapika is doing stuff all in service to his goal of regaining the Kurta eyes. He\u2019s not doing stuff because he\u2019s a Hunter. And look at Killua and Leorio.

None of those hinge on the characters being ninjas, how are you this blind? Then being ninjas is just an aesthetic choice. It does not change any character motivations or goals. \n\nOk. Your last paragraph tells me you\u2019re trolling. The story was about stealth, precision, and strategy? Since\u2026 when? Can you tell me events that happened that cause that to be what the show is about? Actually list multiple major events where all of those were pivotal to the plot. Because\u2026 first of all, \u201cstealth, strategy and precision\u201d aren\u2019t things that a show can be about. Those are things that happen in a story, not themes. Naruto didn\u2019t beat the crap out of Mizuki with any of that. Zabuza didn\u2019t die thanks to stealth, strategy, or precision. The series was not about any of that. My word. This fandom is\u2026 geez\u2026 Maybe you should learn basic storytelling before you try and argue what a shows about, yeah?\n\nAlso, how do you think they beat Kaguya? They came up with a strategy to seal her. How old are you where you can\u2019t see this stuff?",

Enemies come to attack Earth, and Goku along with the other Z-fighters fight to protect it. Goku and Vegata do some things that allow the villains to get stronger, but none of the events happen because Goku and Vegeta go looking for a fight. It isn\u2019t until Super where Goku wants to fight anyone and everyone. Unlike you apparently, I actually watched Dragon Ball Z, so I know what I\u2019m talking about.\n\nGing wasn\u2019t missing. Did you notice how he randomly showed up in the story, and nobody made a big deal about it? Nobody but Gon was searching for Ging. He wasn\u2019t missing. He was just traveling, presumably. \n\nIf you would read, you\u2019d see I only mentioned Hokage once, and it wasn\u2019t even in the comment you\u2019re talking about. The series isn\u2019t even about becoming Hokage. I never said that. Also, notice how you don\u2019t have any actual reasoning besides \u201cBecause I said so\u201d? Who do you think is correct here? You, who can\u2019t bring up any actual examples or reasonings? Or me, who has repeatedly brought up facts from the show and have provided reasonings beyond \u201cbecause I said so\u201d?\n\nOy vey. I guess the price of having a huge fandom is that a lot of ignorant people will fester in it. I wonder if this is how bad all big fandoms are\u2026",

Missing doesn\u2019t mean people are looking for him, they just don\u2019t know where he is.\n\nSo what you\u2019re saying is the series is exactly the same if the position of hokage doesn\u2019t exist?\n\nLook since you weren\u2019t willing to reread, I\u2019ll walk you through it ONE time.I\u2019m not arguing here, in explaining.\n\nNaruto starts somewhat grounded. Kunai, shuriken, swords. There\u2019s magical aspects to make the story unique like the demon fox, chakra, etc. the biggest thing we see happen in part one  is essentially something destroying small area in a forest. \n\nThe story escalated which is expected. The difference is the jumps aren\u2019t massive. The story leans more on the magic than the ninja stuff but the true ninjas aren\u2019t useless or anything. The first big jump is pain and the susanoo. Pain is closer to a comic book villain than a ninja. He flies, he can bring people back to life, he has weird abilities that are unlike anything seen. It\u2019s fine because pain at the time is like the big bad, you expect him to be absurdly strong. \n\nThen the escalation REALLY starts. Naruto learns to go super saiyan. Madara can pull meteors from orbit and easily 1v5 the kage who were considered the top of the top at the start of the series. Then he becomes a Demi god. Then he gets turned into an actual god who can access other dimensions and destroy entire planets.\n\nThe jumps are insane. One of the main aspects of the show is that they\u2019re ninjas. By turning them into gods, that aspect is lost. A million zabuzas literally couldn\u2019t touch kaguya. That\u2019s what people didn\u2019t like. The origin of the show feels lost because the aspect of being ninjas which was core to the early show, is now meaningless",

                                                    "body": "Are you daft? I\u2019ll say it again, so maybe this time you\u2019ll listen. None of the villains attacked because Goku and friends were looking for a fight. They attacked because they always were going to. Goku and Vegeta didn\u2019t do anything that\u2019s caused the enemies to start killing people and blow stuff up. Also, even if what you said counted\u2026 how the hell does that make the series about Saiyans? Hell, you yourself could only think of 2 things. That\u2019s enough to be what the whole series is about? 2 things? \n\nFor someone to be missing, that would mean someone has to be looking for them. Otherwise, you can call anyone missing. For example, by your logic, I\u2019m missing, since you don\u2019t know where I am. \n\nNo, what I\u2019m saying is the series is exactly the same even if they aren\u2019t ninjas. Read next time. \n\nI like how you say the story started somewhat grounded, but then proved to mention things that are not grounded at all. I repeat, HOW IS A LITERAL GIANT DEMON FOX GROUNDED? You\u2019re only accepting it because it\u2019s at the beginning, but that right there demolishes your whole point. Naruto has always had mystical and fantastical elements. So it stupid that you\u2019re only fine with the ones that showed up near the beginning.\n\nIn addition to that, you yourself admitted that Pain was more than a ninja. Hmmm\u2026 it\u2019s almost like what I\u2019ve been saying this entire time is true. The series was never about ninja. That\u2019s just the occupation of the characters. It\u2019s what they are. \u201cNinja\u201d does not define what the characters are capable of, because from the very beginning, the series made it known that the ninjas in the series weren\u2019t the realistic kind. They\u2019re the type with powers, and that can seal and summon stuff. What\u2019s \u201cgrounded\u201d about that? Swords, kunai? Sword were still being used during the war, and so were kunai, so what\u2019s your point? \n\nWhen did Naruto go Super Saiyan? I didn\u2019t see him throwing out Ki blasts or throwing energy balls that could destroy the planet. The most he did was make big craters, but I\u2019m pretty sure characters could do that before Naruto. Hell, the 1st Hokage was able to instantly create a mini forest in his first appearance. And there was a jutsu that summoned death himself to rip the souls out of people. That sounds way more crazy than making craters. \n\nMadara did not become a demigod or a god. What counts as a god to you? A god would be someone who can rewrite reality, or destroy the planet with minimal effort. Madara could do neither. What move of Madara\u2019s could destroy the planet? \u201cGod of Shinobi\u201d is title, it\u2019s not literal you know? He has the title along with Hashirama because they were the strongest ninja to have ever lived.\n\nPretty sure I mentioned this already, but I\u2019ll ask you this time. What do you think a ninja is? Explain that, and then I\u2019ll tell you how from the very beginning, Naruto never had those types of ninjas. And what do you mean it was lost? They were still ninjas all the way through. Did you miss the parts where Naruto used shadow clone jutsu all the time? Or all the taijutsu battles? Or\u2026 literally any other Justus that were used? You\u2019re speaking nonsense here. They never stopped being ninjas. And who cares how many Zabuzas it would take to beat Kaguya? How is that relevant at all? So what, you don\u2019t like it because Zabuza isn\u2019t top tier in strength? Is that you\u2019re problem? You\u2019re just a Zabuza fanboy? Because otherwise, I fail to see the issue that an early villain can\u2019t beat an endgame villain.\n\nEdit: You know, I keep proving how nonsense your arguments are, but really, one thing alone demolishes all you have to say. At the beginning, there was a giant 9-tailed fox that had to be sealed away by a man who summoned a giant toad. The fact that you accept that, but you don\u2019t accept villains with strong Justu (notice how I say villains, because people accept Night Guy, despite the fact he almost killed a \u201cso-called\u201d god) destroys any point you have about the series becoming less grounded. And actually, who cares? If you want a grounded story, maybe don\u2019t look towards the series with shadow clones and tailed beasts, eh? I mean, the characters are grounded, but who cares about characters, right? Power levels are all that matters apparently. It doesn\u2019t matter if the characters are motivated by wants and desires. It\u2019s bad because they do big flashy attacks, right? Anyone who tells you that they liked Naruto because the characters were \u201cninjas\u201d is either lying (to you and themselves) or are very shallow. You don\u2019t like a series because of what the characters are. You like it because of who they are, what they go through, and how they react to it all.",

Since baryon mode doesn't have six paths senjutsu Naruto won't be ale to sense limbo and if you want to make the case that it will be able to sense limbo then fine but still even if baryon mode naruto is able to sense limbo Naruto won't be able to react to limbo just like he couldn't react to it before. The limbo will just keep punching Naruto or they will just use the light fang or they will use the human path to extract Naruto's soul and yes they can do it since limbo have the same abilities as the original. Also Madara will easily be able to match Naruto is taijutsu. He survived against the strongest taijutsu user ever. Naruto's taijutsu is nothing compared to Guy's. Also Madara can just protect himself with the truth seeking orbs which by the way Naruto won't be able to break.

But like i said dual rinnegan juubi Madara is overkill. I would say 1 rinnegan Madara without the 10 tails will also be able to defeat Naruto. This Madara is not immortal but it doesn't matter since baryon mode shaves off life at such a slow rate. Like Naruto punched isshiki so many times and he only managed to shave off like a couple hours of his life \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02. Madara has way way longer to live than that. But even if Madara had a month to live it still wouldn't matter. Naruto would be ale to shave off like an hour from Madara's life. So yeah this Madara also beats him because of limbo and a bunch more things like his experience,the rest of the rinnegan abilities and more.",

Where do the Saiyans come into that? \n\nGing wasn\u2019t missing. Gon was just looking for him. And what did that have to do with being Hunter? Ging flat out says what the series is about. He didn\u2019t say anything about being a Hunter. He said that during the  journey towards your goal, you find things much more important than what you were searching for. Hunter x Hunter is a series that is about \u201cThe journey\u201d. I mean look at the manga right now. Gon found Ging, and so he just went home. If it was about being a Hunter, wouldn\u2019t Gon have found a profession in that field and start doing Hunter work? Even Kurapika is doing stuff all in service to his goal of regaining the Kurta eyes. He\u2019s not doing stuff because he\u2019s a Hunter. And look at Killua and Leorio. One is traveling, the other is studying to be a doctor. How exactly is that about being a Hunter? \n\nWow. It saddens me that you\u2019re part of this fandom. Take away the ninjas, and suddenly the story somehow changes? How does the Uchiha massacre change? How does Sasuke leaving the village due to Itachi\u2019s taunts change? How does Naruto wanting to prove himself and gain respect change? How does Pain wanting to change the world change? How does the wars between the villages change? None of those hinge on the characters being ninjas, how are you this blind? Then being ninjas is just an aesthetic choice. It does not change any character motivations or goals. \n\nOk. Your last paragraph tells me you\u2019re trolling. The story was about stealth, precision, and strategy? Since\u2026 when? Can you tell me events that happened that cause that to be what the show is about? Actually list multiple major events where all of those were pivotal to the plot. Because\u2026 first of all, \u201cstealth, strategy and precision\u201d aren\u2019t things that a show can be about. Those are things that happen in a story, not themes. Naruto didn\u2019t beat the crap out of Mizuki with any of that. Zabuza didn\u2019t die thanks to stealth, strategy, or precision. The series was not about any of that. My word. This fandom is\u2026 geez\u2026 Maybe you should learn basic storytelling before you try and argue what a shows about, yeah?\n\nAlso, how do you think they beat Kaguya? They came up with a strategy to seal her. How old are you where you can\u2019t see this stuff?",

Kunai, shuriken, swords. There\u2019s magical aspects to make the story unique like the demon fox, chakra, etc. the biggest thing we see happen in part one  is essentially something destroying small area in a forest. \n\nThe story escalated which is expected. The difference is the jumps aren\u2019t massive. The story leans more on the magic than the ninja stuff but the true ninjas aren\u2019t useless or anything. The first big jump is pain and the susanoo. Pain is closer to a comic book villain than a ninja. He flies, he can bring people back to life, he has weird abilities that are unlike anything seen. It\u2019s fine because pain at the time is like the big bad, you expect him to be absurdly strong. \n\nThen the escalation REALLY starts. Naruto learns to go super saiyan. Madara can pull meteors from orbit and easily 1v5 the kage who were considered the top of the top at the start of the series. Then he becomes a Demi god. Then he gets turned into an actual god who can access other dimensions and destroy entire planets.\n\nThe jumps are insane. One of the main aspects of the show is that they\u2019re ninjas. By turning them into gods, that aspect is lost. A million zabuzas literally couldn\u2019t touch kaguya. That\u2019s what people didn\u2019t like. The origin of the show feels lost because the aspect of being ninjas which was core to the early show, is now meaningless",

None of the villains attacked because Goku and friends were looking for a fight. They attacked because they always were going to. Goku and Vegeta didn\u2019t do anything that\u2019s caused the enemies to start killing people and blow stuff up. Also, even if what you said counted\u2026 how the hell does that make the series about Saiyans? Hell, you yourself could only think of 2 things. That\u2019s enough to be what the whole series is about? 2 things? \n\nFor someone to be missing, that would mean someone has to be looking for them. Otherwise, you can call anyone missing. For example, by your logic, I\u2019m missing, since you don\u2019t know where I am. \n\nNo, what I\u2019m saying is the series is exactly the same even if they aren\u2019t ninjas. Read next time. \n\nI like how you say the story started somewhat grounded, but then proved to mention things that are not grounded at all. I repeat, HOW IS A LITERAL GIANT DEMON FOX GROUNDED? You\u2019re only accepting it because it\u2019s at the beginning, but that right there demolishes your whole point. Naruto has always had mystical and fantastical elements. So it stupid that you\u2019re only fine with the ones that showed up near the beginning.\n\nIn addition to that, you yourself admitted that Pain was more than a ninja. Hmmm\u2026 it\u2019s almost like what I\u2019ve been saying this entire time is true. The series was never about ninja. That\u2019s just the occupation of the characters. It\u2019s what they are. \u201cNinja\u201d does not define what the characters are capable of, because from the very beginning, the series made it known that the ninjas in the series weren\u2019t the realistic kind. They\u2019re the type with powers, and that can seal and summon stuff. What\u2019s \u201cgrounded\u201d about that? Swords, kunai? Sword were still being used during the war, and so were kunai, so what\u2019s your point? \n\nWhen did Naruto go Super Saiyan? I didn\u2019t see him throwing out Ki blasts or throwing energy balls that could destroy the planet. The most he did was make big craters, but I\u2019m pretty sure characters could do that before Naruto. Hell, the 1st Hokage was able to instantly create a mini forest in his first appearance. And there was a jutsu that summoned death himself to rip the souls out of people. That sounds way more crazy than making craters. \n\nMadara did not become a demigod or a god. What counts as a god to you? A god would be someone who can rewrite reality, or destroy the planet with minimal effort. Madara could do neither. What move of Madara\u2019s could destroy the planet? \u201cGod of Shinobi\u201d is title, it\u2019s not literal you know? He has the title along with Hashirama because they were the strongest ninja to have ever lived.\n\nPretty sure I mentioned this already, but I\u2019ll ask you this time. What do you think a ninja is? Explain that, and then I\u2019ll tell you how from the very beginning, Naruto never had those types of ninjas. And what do you mean it was lost? They were still ninjas all the way through. Did you miss the parts where Naruto used shadow clone jutsu all the time? Or all the taijutsu battles? Or\u2026 literally any other Justus that were used? You\u2019re speaking nonsense here. They never stopped being ninjas. And who cares how many Zabuzas it would take to beat Kaguya? How is that relevant at all? So what, you don\u2019t like it because Zabuza isn\u2019t top tier in strength? Is that you\u2019re problem? You\u2019re just a Zabuza fanboy? Because otherwise, I fail to see the issue that an early villain can\u2019t beat an endgame villain.\n\nEdit: You know, I keep proving how nonsense your arguments are, but really, one thing alone demolishes all you have to say. At the beginning, there was a giant 9-tailed fox that had to be sealed away by a man who summoned a giant toad. The fact that you accept that, but you don\u2019t accept villains with strong Justu (notice how I say villains, because people accept Night Guy, despite the fact he almost killed a \u201cso-called\u201d god) destroys any point you have about the series becoming less grounded. And actually, who cares? If you want a grounded story, maybe don\u2019t look towards the series with shadow clones and tailed beasts, eh? I mean, the characters are grounded, but who cares about characters, right? Power levels are all that matters apparently. It doesn\u2019t matter if the characters are motivated by wants and desires. It\u2019s bad because they do big flashy attacks, right? Anyone who tells you that they liked Naruto because the characters were \u201cninjas\u201d is either lying (to you and themselves) or are very shallow. You don\u2019t like a series because of what the characters are. You like it because of who they are, what they go through, and how they react to it all.",

Kunai, shuriken, swords. There\u2019s magical aspects to make the story unique like the demon fox, chakra, etc. the biggest thing we see happen in part one  is essentially something destroying small area in a forest. \n\nThe story escalated which is expected. The difference is the jumps aren\u2019t massive. The story leans more on the magic than the ninja stuff but the true ninjas aren\u2019t useless or anything. The first big jump is pain and the susanoo. Pain is closer to a comic book villain than a ninja. He flies, he can bring people back to life, he has weird abilities that are unlike anything seen. It\u2019s fine because pain at the time is like the big bad, you expect him to be absurdly strong. \n\nThen the escalation REALLY starts. Naruto learns to go super saiyan. Madara can pull meteors from orbit and easily 1v5 the kage who were considered the top of the top at the start of the series. Then he becomes a Demi god. Then he gets turned into an actual god who can access other dimensions and destroy entire planets.\n\nThe jumps are insane. One of the main aspects of the show is that they\u2019re ninjas. By turning them into gods, that aspect is lost. A million zabuzas literally couldn\u2019t touch kaguya. That\u2019s what people didn\u2019t like. The origin of the show feels lost because the aspect of being ninjas which was core to the early show, is now meaningless",

                                    "body": "Are you daft? I\u2019ll say it again, so maybe this time you\u2019ll listen. None of the villains attacked because Goku and friends were looking for a fight. They attacked because they always were going to. Goku and Vegeta didn\u2019t do anything that\u2019s caused the enemies to start killing people and blow stuff up. Also, even if what you said counted\u2026 how the hell does that make the series about Saiyans? Hell, you yourself could only think of 2 things. That\u2019s enough to be what the whole series is about? 2 things? \n\nFor someone to be missing, that would mean someone has to be looking for them. Otherwise, you can call anyone missing. For example, by your logic, I\u2019m missing, since you don\u2019t know where I am. \n\nNo, what I\u2019m saying is the series is exactly the same even if they aren\u2019t ninjas. Read next time. \n\nI like how you say the story started somewhat grounded, but then proved to mention things that are not grounded at all. I repeat, HOW IS A LITERAL GIANT DEMON FOX GROUNDED? You\u2019re only accepting it because it\u2019s at the beginning, but that right there demolishes your whole point. Naruto has always had mystical and fantastical elements. So it stupid that you\u2019re only fine with the ones that showed up near the beginning.\n\nIn addition to that, you yourself admitted that Pain was more than a ninja. Hmmm\u2026 it\u2019s almost like what I\u2019ve been saying this entire time is true. The series was never about ninja. That\u2019s just the occupation of the characters. It\u2019s what they are. \u201cNinja\u201d does not define what the characters are capable of, because from the very beginning, the series made it known that the ninjas in the series weren\u2019t the realistic kind. They\u2019re the type with powers, and that can seal and summon stuff. What\u2019s \u201cgrounded\u201d about that? Swords, kunai? Sword were still being used during the war, and so were kunai, so what\u2019s your point? \n\nWhen did Naruto go Super Saiyan? I didn\u2019t see him throwing out Ki blasts or throwing energy balls that could destroy the planet. The most he did was make big craters, but I\u2019m pretty sure characters could do that before Naruto. Hell, the 1st Hokage was able to instantly create a mini forest in his first appearance. And there was a jutsu that summoned death himself to rip the souls out of people. That sounds way more crazy than making craters. \n\nMadara did not become a demigod or a god. What counts as a god to you? A god would be someone who can rewrite reality, or destroy the planet with minimal effort. Madara could do neither. What move of Madara\u2019s could destroy the planet? \u201cGod of Shinobi\u201d is title, it\u2019s not literal you know? He has the title along with Hashirama because they were the strongest ninja to have ever lived.\n\nPretty sure I mentioned this already, but I\u2019ll ask you this time. What do you think a ninja is? Explain that, and then I\u2019ll tell you how from the very beginning, Naruto never had those types of ninjas. And what do you mean it was lost? They were still ninjas all the way through. Did you miss the parts where Naruto used shadow clone jutsu all the time? Or all the taijutsu battles? Or\u2026 literally any other Justus that were used? You\u2019re speaking nonsense here. They never stopped being ninjas. And who cares how many Zabuzas it would take to beat Kaguya? How is that relevant at all? So what, you don\u2019t like it because Zabuza isn\u2019t top tier in strength? Is that you\u2019re problem? You\u2019re just a Zabuza fanboy? Because otherwise, I fail to see the issue that an early villain can\u2019t beat an endgame villain.\n\nEdit: You know, I keep proving how nonsense your arguments are, but really, one thing alone demolishes all you have to say. At the beginning, there was a giant 9-tailed fox that had to be sealed away by a man who summoned a giant toad. The fact that you accept that, but you don\u2019t accept villains with strong Justu (notice how I say villains, because people accept Night Guy, despite the fact he almost killed a \u201cso-called\u201d god) destroys any point you have about the series becoming less grounded. And actually, who cares? If you want a grounded story, maybe don\u2019t look towards the series with shadow clones and tailed beasts, eh? I mean, the characters are grounded, but who cares about characters, right? Power levels are all that matters apparently. It doesn\u2019t matter if the characters are motivated by wants and desires. It\u2019s bad because they do big flashy attacks, right? Anyone who tells you that they liked Naruto because the characters were \u201cninjas\u201d is either lying (to you and themselves) or are very shallow. You don\u2019t like a series because of what the characters are. You like it because of who they are, what they go through, and how they react to it all.",

Like a prime example of that is when Naruto attacks him with the sage art lava style rasenshuriken. That whole scene was obviously done to hype up Naruto's new powers. Madara could done a billion things to counter it. He could have just absorbed it,he could have used shinra tensei,he could have used susanoo and he could have done a billion other things to counter it.

He was just traveling, presumably. \n\nIf you would read, you\u2019d see I only mentioned Hokage once, and it wasn\u2019t even in the comment you\u2019re talking about. The series isn\u2019t even about becoming Hokage. I never said that. Also, notice how you don\u2019t have any actual reasoning besides \u201cBecause I said so\u201d? Who do you think is correct here? You, who can\u2019t bring up any actual examples or reasonings? Or me, who has repeatedly brought up facts from the show and have provided reasonings beyond \u201cbecause I said so\u201d?\n\nOy vey. I guess the price of having a huge fandom is that a lot of ignorant people will fester in it. I wonder if this is how bad all big fandoms are\u2026",

                            "body": "Are you daft? I\u2019ll say it again, so maybe this time you\u2019ll listen. None of the villains attacked because Goku and friends were looking for a fight. They attacked because they always were going to. Goku and Vegeta didn\u2019t do anything that\u2019s caused the enemies to start killing people and blow stuff up. Also, even if what you said counted\u2026 how the hell does that make the series about Saiyans? Hell, you yourself could only think of 2 things. That\u2019s enough to be what the whole series is about? 2 things? \n\nFor someone to be missing, that would mean someone has to be looking for them. Otherwise, you can call anyone missing. For example, by your logic, I\u2019m missing, since you don\u2019t know where I am. \n\nNo, what I\u2019m saying is the series is exactly the same even if they aren\u2019t ninjas. Read next time. \n\nI like how you say the story started somewhat grounded, but then proved to mention things that are not grounded at all. I repeat, HOW IS A LITERAL GIANT DEMON FOX GROUNDED? You\u2019re only accepting it because it\u2019s at the beginning, but that right there demolishes your whole point. Naruto has always had mystical and fantastical elements. So it stupid that you\u2019re only fine with the ones that showed up near the beginning.\n\nIn addition to that, you yourself admitted that Pain was more than a ninja. Hmmm\u2026 it\u2019s almost like what I\u2019ve been saying this entire time is true. The series was never about ninja. That\u2019s just the occupation of the characters. It\u2019s what they are. \u201cNinja\u201d does not define what the characters are capable of, because from the very beginning, the series made it known that the ninjas in the series weren\u2019t the realistic kind. They\u2019re the type with powers, and that can seal and summon stuff. What\u2019s \u201cgrounded\u201d about that? Swords, kunai? Sword were still being used during the war, and so were kunai, so what\u2019s your point? \n\nWhen did Naruto go Super Saiyan? I didn\u2019t see him throwing out Ki blasts or throwing energy balls that could destroy the planet. The most he did was make big craters, but I\u2019m pretty sure characters could do that before Naruto. Hell, the 1st Hokage was able to instantly create a mini forest in his first appearance. And there was a jutsu that summoned death himself to rip the souls out of people. That sounds way more crazy than making craters. \n\nMadara did not become a demigod or a god. What counts as a god to you? A god would be someone who can rewrite reality, or destroy the planet with minimal effort. Madara could do neither. What move of Madara\u2019s could destroy the planet? \u201cGod of Shinobi\u201d is title, it\u2019s not literal you know? He has the title along with Hashirama because they were the strongest ninja to have ever lived.\n\nPretty sure I mentioned this already, but I\u2019ll ask you this time. What do you think a ninja is? Explain that, and then I\u2019ll tell you how from the very beginning, Naruto never had those types of ninjas. And what do you mean it was lost? They were still ninjas all the way through. Did you miss the parts where Naruto used shadow clone jutsu all the time? Or all the taijutsu battles? Or\u2026 literally any other Justus that were used? You\u2019re speaking nonsense here. They never stopped being ninjas. And who cares how many Zabuzas it would take to beat Kaguya? How is that relevant at all? So what, you don\u2019t like it because Zabuza isn\u2019t top tier in strength? Is that you\u2019re problem? You\u2019re just a Zabuza fanboy? Because otherwise, I fail to see the issue that an early villain can\u2019t beat an endgame villain.\n\nEdit: You know, I keep proving how nonsense your arguments are, but really, one thing alone demolishes all you have to say. At the beginning, there was a giant 9-tailed fox that had to be sealed away by a man who summoned a giant toad. The fact that you accept that, but you don\u2019t accept villains with strong Justu (notice how I say villains, because people accept Night Guy, despite the fact he almost killed a \u201cso-called\u201d god) destroys any point you have about the series becoming less grounded. And actually, who cares? If you want a grounded story, maybe don\u2019t look towards the series with shadow clones and tailed beasts, eh? I mean, the characters are grounded, but who cares about characters, right? Power levels are all that matters apparently. It doesn\u2019t matter if the characters are motivated by wants and desires. It\u2019s bad because they do big flashy attacks, right? Anyone who tells you that they liked Naruto because the characters were \u201cninjas\u201d is either lying (to you and themselves) or are very shallow. You don\u2019t like a series because of what the characters are. You like it because of who they are, what they go through, and how they react to it all.",

But even if Madara had a month to live it still wouldn't matter. Naruto would be ale to shave off like an hour from Madara's life. So yeah this Madara also beats him because of limbo and a bunch more things like his experience,the rest of the rinnegan abilities and more.",

            "body": "Are you daft? I\u2019ll say it again, so maybe this time you\u2019ll listen. None of the villains attacked because Goku and friends were looking for a fight. They attacked because they always were going to. Goku and Vegeta didn\u2019t do anything that\u2019s caused the enemies to start killing people and blow stuff up. Also, even if what you said counted\u2026 how the hell does that make the series about Saiyans? Hell, you yourself could only think of 2 things. That\u2019s enough to be what the whole series is about? 2 things? \n\nFor someone to be missing, that would mean someone has to be looking for them. Otherwise, you can call anyone missing. For example, by your logic, I\u2019m missing, since you don\u2019t know where I am. \n\nNo, what I\u2019m saying is the series is exactly the same even if they aren\u2019t ninjas. Read next time. \n\nI like how you say the story started somewhat grounded, but then proved to mention things that are not grounded at all. I repeat, HOW IS A LITERAL GIANT DEMON FOX GROUNDED? You\u2019re only accepting it because it\u2019s at the beginning, but that right there demolishes your whole point. Naruto has always had mystical and fantastical elements. So it stupid that you\u2019re only fine with the ones that showed up near the beginning.\n\nIn addition to that, you yourself admitted that Pain was more than a ninja. Hmmm\u2026 it\u2019s almost like what I\u2019ve been saying this entire time is true. The series was never about ninja. That\u2019s just the occupation of the characters. It\u2019s what they are. \u201cNinja\u201d does not define what the characters are capable of, because from the very beginning, the series made it known that the ninjas in the series weren\u2019t the realistic kind. They\u2019re the type with powers, and that can seal and summon stuff. What\u2019s \u201cgrounded\u201d about that? Swords, kunai? Sword were still being used during the war, and so were kunai, so what\u2019s your point? \n\nWhen did Naruto go Super Saiyan? I didn\u2019t see him throwing out Ki blasts or throwing energy balls that could destroy the planet. The most he did was make big craters, but I\u2019m pretty sure characters could do that before Naruto. Hell, the 1st Hokage was able to instantly create a mini forest in his first appearance. And there was a jutsu that summoned death himself to rip the souls out of people. That sounds way more crazy than making craters. \n\nMadara did not become a demigod or a god. What counts as a god to you? A god would be someone who can rewrite reality, or destroy the planet with minimal effort. Madara could do neither. What move of Madara\u2019s could destroy the planet? \u201cGod of Shinobi\u201d is title, it\u2019s not literal you know? He has the title along with Hashirama because they were the strongest ninja to have ever lived.\n\nPretty sure I mentioned this already, but I\u2019ll ask you this time. What do you think a ninja is? Explain that, and then I\u2019ll tell you how from the very beginning, Naruto never had those types of ninjas. And what do you mean it was lost? They were still ninjas all the way through. Did you miss the parts where Naruto used shadow clone jutsu all the time? Or all the taijutsu battles? Or\u2026 literally any other Justus that were used? You\u2019re speaking nonsense here. They never stopped being ninjas. And who cares how many Zabuzas it would take to beat Kaguya? How is that relevant at all? So what, you don\u2019t like it because Zabuza isn\u2019t top tier in strength? Is that you\u2019re problem? You\u2019re just a Zabuza fanboy? Because otherwise, I fail to see the issue that an early villain can\u2019t beat an endgame villain.\n\nEdit: You know, I keep proving how nonsense your arguments are, but really, one thing alone demolishes all you have to say. At the beginning, there was a giant 9-tailed fox that had to be sealed away by a man who summoned a giant toad. The fact that you accept that, but you don\u2019t accept villains with strong Justu (notice how I say villains, because people accept Night Guy, despite the fact he almost killed a \u201cso-called\u201d god) destroys any point you have about the series becoming less grounded. And actually, who cares? If you want a grounded story, maybe don\u2019t look towards the series with shadow clones and tailed beasts, eh? I mean, the characters are grounded, but who cares about characters, right? Power levels are all that matters apparently. It doesn\u2019t matter if the characters are motivated by wants and desires. It\u2019s bad because they do big flashy attacks, right? Anyone who tells you that they liked Naruto because the characters were \u201cninjas\u201d is either lying (to you and themselves) or are very shallow. You don\u2019t like a series because of what the characters are. You like it because of who they are, what they go through, and how they react to it all.",

            "body": "2 rinnegan juubi Madara wins no diff. Actually 2 rinnegan juubi Madara is overkill. Baryon mode is one of the most overrated things in the entire Naruto universe. It only worked on isshiki because he had a short life span it won't work against someone like Madara who not only is stronger than isshiki but is also immortal. Since baryon mode doesn't have six paths senjutsu Naruto won't be ale to sense limbo and if you want to make the case that it will be able to sense limbo then fine but still even if baryon mode naruto is able to sense limbo Naruto won't be able to react to limbo just like he couldn't react to it before. The limbo will just keep punching Naruto or they will just use the light fang or they will use the human path to extract Naruto's soul and yes they can do it since limbo have the same abilities as the original. Also Madara will easily be able to match Naruto is taijutsu. He survived against the strongest taijutsu user ever. Naruto's taijutsu is nothing compared to Guy's. Also Madara can just protect himself with the truth seeking orbs which by the way Naruto won't be able to break. Like i said Naruto's taijutsu is nothing compared to Guy's and Guy was barely able to break the truth seeking orbs. These are some of the many ways Madara destroys Naruto. But like i said dual rinnegan juubi Madara is overkill. I would say 1 rinnegan Madara without the 10 tails will also be able to defeat Naruto. This Madara is not immortal but it doesn't matter since baryon mode shaves off life at such a slow rate. Like Naruto punched isshiki so many times and he only managed to shave off like a couple hours of his life \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02. Madara has way way longer to live than that.
