    "body": "I'm from outside of South Korea so I don't know where HaHa is reserved in conversations concerning Rm, but i seriously think he is an important member alongside Jae Suk and Kwang Soo. In most comment sections on rm episodes, i dont see much love for HaHa but he creates a good atmosphere, is able to shift the energy in the scenes and always has a good remark or joke up his sleeve. In early RM, he basically created all the character types from playboy to betrayer which have been later taken on by Kwang Soo and So Min. \n\n I feel that because HaHa got married, he had to reshape his character and thus single members were given more light after adopting roles that HaHa created. I personally wouldn't put Seok Jin or So Min above HaHa but I see a lot of people do. Personally I think So Min tries too hard to be funny and theres nothing wrong with effort but to be funny we like to see it flow naturally and effortless and I believe HaHa does exactly that. \n\nHe's witty, funny, and physically good at games too despite members downplaying his ability bc hes small. And even guests don't seem to choose HaHa as a partner/group member like they do with the others and its just saddening bc HaHa is a member a guest should vie for. \n\nAlso, Rm rarely assemble Haha, Kwang Soo and Jae Seok in a group- i believe this would be the funniest combination bc of the betraying and their wits. \n\nIm just wondering if there are other avid watchers of rm who see the importance of HaHa on the show.",

He knows his strengths and doesn't necessarily go overboard to steal the limelight but is always willing to play support. \n\nI also love that he is the best sport and is able to take a joke and be least offended and goes along with things well. \n\nHe's a bit like Lee Soo Geun to me. Hilarious but in a witty way mainly. \n\nAlso to add, he is a great game changer in episodes where there is spies, role playing or betrayal. He is never as overtly suspicious as JSJ or LSK. And he doesn't play as nice as KJK so he's like a YJS but more cunning. I love it.",

In many of the earlier episodes, they would partner guests who were clearly more reserved/nervous/awkward with Haha bc he could adapt to their personality and put them at ease by being either overly silly or obnoxious (to break the ice).\n\nThis is also apparent in how close he is with many of the members. (Ji Hyo, for example, would constantly pick Haha as her partner after Gary left, and I can only assume this is bc she is comfortable with him. Even when Gary was here, and she needed to pick a 3rd member on her team, it was Haha. Gary also mentioned how he looked up to Haha when he started RM as he was new to variety shows)\n\nIn short, Haha's the man.",

            "body": "I completely agree. HaHa is a very integral and important part of the show. A lot of points were already made above about how he really is a top member. The PD who said that he\u2019s sort of like a middleman can\u2019t really be seen on-screen, but is really important.\n\nI remember in one of the episode where they could choose to be the center, he and Gary chose to be on the side as they almost always do says a lot about him. He\u2019s one of the people the PD\u2019s can count on whenever a particular bit doesn\u2019t work that well or a guest isn\u2019t particularly standing out because of normally being reserved or what have you. Again, as said above, he knows how to adapt to people and act overly silly or create bits to get the guest to stand out more = more screentime which is the main reason they\u2019re guesting in the first place. I remember when Seo Jang Hoon first guested in RM when i guess he was still starting out in variety and being the grumpy goose that he was, HaHa overly annoyed him for laughs.\n\nI also think it helps a lot that he is very, very sociable and outgoing in real life, with him having real, personal friendships with a lot of celebrities off-screen (to use Jang Hoon again as an example, watch the episode of Knowing Brothers where he guested. It was really a treat to see him annoying the piss out of Jang Hoon).\n\nBeing in show business for a long time, he knows what his role is especially next to YJS. He compliments him well and with their combined know how, they know how to push the show forward for entertainments sake. HaHa really is one of the core members of the show especially now that he\u2019s in the middle of the group age-wise to unify the members (not that they\u2019re not close, but you get what I mean).",

I can\u2019t even remember if there\u2019s any episode that was dedicated to him. Nonetheless I cannot imagine RM without him. I think he\u2019s the wittiest member on the show.",

But he's as experienced as Jaeseok when it comes to variety show, both can adapt quickly to any guest and situation.\n\nHaha and Jaeseok, and Kwangsoo too actually often makes funny scene, but they're not getting much attention, while Somin became trending just because her armpit sweating? A scene where i personally think isn't funny, rather gross, but the situation makes it funny.\n\nWhile those three above always makes their scene funny, but it's been 10 years, and they always be funny. When they makes a funny scene, it's another funny scene as usual, they're funny, everyone knows. But someone like Somin, who is an actress, suddenly becomes funny? People are gonna talk about it. because it's new, fresh, things they didn't expect to happen.\n\nYou might argue that Jaeseok often makes headline too, but it's not Jaeseok that makes the headline, for example: Jaeseok and Jessi, it's because Jessi doing something fresh, makes Jaeseok became trending as well. Jaeseok become Trot singer, it's Yoo Sanseul that makes Jaeseok became trending, something new, fresh.\n\nHaha is always consistent and funny, he is just like many big names like Jaeseok, Dongyup, Hodong, Soogeun, and Janghoon, he'll always be hired by a show, and people will always appreciate him, but don't be surprised if there's nothing new, there'll be no trending over him. To say that he's not getting enough appreciation is a bit not right IMO, maybe he's not getting enough spotlight is more suitable.\n\nI think just like anyone on the show he's super important, if i'm gonna rank him, i'll put him to the 2nd most important, and i think he's as important as a co-host to Jaeseok in RM as he is in Infinite Challenge.

He's proved well with spy missions, but he hasn't in recent years been given that spotlight on an episode where it's HaHa's episode.

So Min is good too, with her off handed variety comments and the like and I wouldn't take anything away from her. \n\nIf YJS really wanted he could have enough content to outshine everyone else (He is a variety monster), but he prefers to accentuate the performance of the rest, particularly KS and JSJ. The older guys are kinda like the bass guitar in a rock band. Amazing performance but seldom heard by the masses. So instead of ranking our RM members, just enjoy them as a whole, even if we have our favorites (our hyung is not an idiot xD)",

He's proved well with spy missions, but he hasn't in recent years been given that spotlight on an episode where it's HaHa's episode. But with this, i do understand that HaHa is the middleman and he humbly carries the show.",

So Min is good too, with her off handed variety comments and the like and I wouldn't take anything away from her. \n\nIf YJS really wanted he could have enough content to outshine everyone else (He is a variety monster), but he prefers to accentuate the performance of the rest, particularly KS and JSJ. The older guys are kinda like the bass guitar in a rock band. Amazing performance but seldom heard by the masses. So instead of ranking our RM members, just enjoy them as a whole, even if we have our favorites (our hyung is not an idiot xD)",
