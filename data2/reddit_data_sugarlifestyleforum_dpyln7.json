    "body": "My background....9 years as a SD. One 2 year arrangement, One 6 year arrangement.  I think I take care of my SB's pretty well.  I've done PPM and monthly...the 6 year SR I took care of everything.  Car, tuition, rent, phone, insurance.  I'm not adverse to taking care of someone who takes care of me. Whatever the allowance...I find I probably invest twice that amount with travel, shopping, gifts, etc.\n\nI've routinely seen 19 to 24 year olds....but made contact with an older SB (36).  A mom, finishing up accounting degree.  Mixed race looking for a Caucasian SD for a long term relationship. I thought, for some reason,  this could be an opportunity to find someone to have a more mature, lasting relationship.\n\nWe meet at Starbucks on Sunday evening -- I tell her I only have an hour before we meet.  As soon as I saw her, I thought she was perfect.  Beautiful. Petite. Exotic Appearance.  Mature. Could converse and engage unlike anyone I'd met.  I've never enjoyed talking with anyone more. That hour went by in seconds -- I asked if we could continue the next morning and she said she'd love to.\n\nThe next morning we meet at Starbucks again...and we talk for FOUR HOURS!!!!  It sped by.  During this time, we  not only agreed to meeting twice a week.  I offered an amount....she said that's fine.  \n\nFound out our birthdays are literally a day apart and within the next couple of weeks---we work out the details to spend the day at an antique festival she wanted to attend.  I also invited her to attend a concert with me in December...we worked through the details and locked that in.  The last hour we started talking about skiing...she dreamed of going to Banff--I've been and told her I'd take her.  Believe it or not....I was the one who said we should probably go.  Our first private date was to be in 4 days.\n\nI get in my car....a couple of minutes go by and I text her that I couldn't believe we talked that long.  She replied that she'd never spent that much time talking to someone.  Then I get this text:\n\n\"I think the compensation is not enough for the requirements. It was very nice to meet you!\"\n\nI texted back and asked if we needed to adjust the \"requirements\" or the allowance.  Nothing.  Find out she blocked me.  Blocked me on SA.  I'm thinking......What????  This was the very last person I would have expected this from.\n\nI'm not going to lie....this was someone I could see spending years with.  I was certainly not going to hold back on a few extra hundred dollars a month.  Plus....I'd already committed to taking her on trips that she wanted to take.  And nothing.\n\nAnd to think that the 19 to 24 year olds are more stable.",

When she did, he asked for an explanation and instead of being an adult she ghosted him. \n\nWhere was he in the wrong exactly? \n\nMaybe he mentioned her looks to give us a better description or understanding and if he's into a certain look then surly that's ok?\n\nI mean how many times do both sides post about having to be attracted to each other, have a connection, etc.\n\nIf you get to be picky who you sleep with, so do we, especially when we're the one paying for the experience. \n\nShe clearly wasn't into him, he'll never get an honest answer why, and she acted like a child in her response, sort of like you, but I don't see anything he's done wrong based on what we have here.",

She was probably annoyed about that and that\u2019s why she changed her mind! In all seriousness I would never go on a coffee date with any POT that just shows me you\u2019re too cheap to buy dinner and this fool took her on not one but TWO coffee dates and had the nerve to keep her at Starbucks for four hours! How awkward! Ugh that\u2019s so annoying! Also another thing about coffee dates it\u2019s awkward because you don\u2019t know when the \u201cdate\u201d is over. He probably offered a cheap allowance and wanted to see her multiple times a week to get his moneys worth, when she did the math after the date and realized this man is actually cheap and wants sex that adds up to 100$ (Ball park) a session she was offended that he would even offer that in the first place and told him she\u2019s not interested. I bet I\u2019m right lol dude you could have at least taken her to lunch the second date... come on! You literally showed her you like to cut corners to save money, That\u2019s what coffee dates show me... think about it us women have to waste time money doing our hair, makeup, nails, outfit, transportation to get there, and you are willing to spend ten dollars upon our meetup? This speaks volumes on how you will be during the relationship. Food for thought, good luck!",

Its a high chance that she may have went back with her previous SD who all along may have given her a very high allowance. I was in the same situation and did the same thing like how she replied you because we realise the allowance gap is too BIG to even mention it to the Pot. I literally just told the pot that the allowance is too far from my expectation and what he wants from me and I blocked him everywhere. I hope he's not reading this. Lol",

You cannot justify her actions based on this scenario alone.\n\nEither she's flakey or the OP did or said something that offended her.",

                            "body": "If you are in that position you would \"know\" the amount of financial help you would need. Not just a few hundred bucks more. The SB mentioned by OP is finishing her studies which probably means another term or semester to go. And also this SB is a mum. Go think about how much money would you need to cover your child cost, housing cost, insurance for child and you, her accounting degree cost. I was in that position and my SD helped me to pay everything. I do know that the allowance she would need would be quite intense. To study and take care of a child she probably have no time to work. And in addition she would probably need to fork out for the kids childhood education.\n\nSpending 4 hours is only getting to know a person. 4 hours isnt even long enough to know a person much tbh. \n\nThe SB  cut off OP totally isn't very nice. This SB probably does not want the ping-pong exchange of negotiating the Allowance. As per what OP had said he didn't mind parting a couple more hundred as allowance for this SB. A couple hundred more wouldnt be enough to finance a degree, wouldn't be enough to feed a kid and so on and so forth. Therefore instead of exchanging such conversation with OP she had been straight up to tell him that it's the allowance and cut him off totally. I had been in a same situation years back and I know \"exactly\" how it feels. She was just being polite to what was offered by OP instead of rejecting straight in his face which is kind of ugly. In addition, this SB is a MUM OK. If she goes on holiday with the OP. She probably have to hire a nanny as well to take care of the kids. These are unseen cost. I had been there done that.\n\nOlder SB being more matured cut off op totally instead of ping pong games negotiation like how younger SB will negotiate for that 50-100 dollar more allowance. In fact most older SB don't even do PPM. I have never heard of Ppm until I come to this community. And it's a norm actually, if the allowance offered is too far from expectation there's isn't much room for negotiation so why continue to converse with this person? Lol.\n\nIn addition, I have had a bunch of long term SR SB chatting buddies who found me in this slf community and DM me to chat. They too have never heard of ppm until they come to this community.

When asked about reliability, she had excellent answers but also excellent reasoning to back up those answers. I didn't see a SINGLE red flag. liked her so much i offered her the job at the end of the interview, gave her the paperwork, got her signed up for our app, and set up her first shifts. i told her multiple times she could go home and think about it then call me back (this was an entry level job). She insisted she wanted this job and to work at this specific coffee shop.\n\nwe complete paperwork, we enjoy chatting, have lots of hobbies in common, i make sure she's signed up for the app, and we part ways with her first shifts scheduled, and from what i can tell, she's very excited about it.\n\nthen comes the day of her first shift. it's 1 minute after when she should start which is whatever, that happens when they haven't figured out they need to show up 5 minutes early to find parking. i wait. i wait and wait. maybe she thought it said 11 am. so i wait until 11. then i call her. this woman immediately ignores my call, but there's bad cell service where i'm at so i chock it up to the service and move to a window then dial again. she BLOCKED ME. I check the app, she deleted her account like 4 hours after our interview, the previous day.\n\nmy whole point is, we live in a strange world, where all signs point to \"YES THIS IS THE ONE!!!!!\" but the other person apparently doesn't see it that way, but gives off all signs like they do. I was really bothered by this one but life moves on. sorry she couldn't see the value in you.",

They see any contact or interaction they have with others (including friends family and co-workers) as disloyalty. Thet make ever effort to isolate their partner from friends,  family and co-workers. They see their jealousy as normal in a loving relationship.  They see their anger and rage as justified by disloyalty. Alcohol and drug abuse is common.

Ummm Dude sounds crazy intense and women of a certain age like us 35 yr olds have been there before. It sucks when someone wants more than you are capable of giving. Men who have these fall right into love things often are so into their own feelings they ignore ours. She probably through all kinds of signals he is missing.\n\n2. He met her at a Starbucks!!! Just don\u2019t like don\u2019t that\u2019s so tacky and not screaming I can give you luxury vacations or a better life when ya spring for a $5 cup of coffee. Surely there was a nice bistro.\n\n3. Did he talk about sex? This is where a lot of SD\u2019s will lose me personally. They will be doing just fine seem like nice engaging men then OMG their Pervy side comes out...are you sensual? GROSS everyone stop using that word. Or they get all pervy old man and well ya only know it if you experience it. \n\n4. By the way he bragged about his past relationships sounds like he maybe a bit too bravos about his SD skills and think every woman will give him what he got before. I walk away from men who are looking for exactly what they had before, I\u2019m not going to try to meet a bar set by another woman.\n\n5. A couple hundred dollars more?!?! How would that change much of anything. \n\n6. Maybe she was talking about things she would LIKE to do and he jumps all in with big plans when she is sitting in a Starbucks he has now wasted yes I\u2019m using the word wasted 2 days of her time and he is treating allowance as an after thought to all this time together. \n\n7. What does her age have to do with anything other than she is probably self aware enough to know it\u2019s not a good fit??? Maybe a younger woman with less self awareness would be like oh I could make this work or plan to milk this guy who obviously sounds to have some narcissistic traits. \n\n8. It\u2019s not ghosting to politely refuse and move on. Who the hell knows what was said completely at this 4 hr second date which he should have had at a nicer place. Did he talk about sex and allowance instead of just freakin doing it?!?! Why not a nice breakfast at a hotel and saying let\u2019s move forward if you are ready. The guys who don\u2019t move forward quickly a lot of times are frauds or indicative of someone who should be just dating. \n\nOh again stop pandering to him sounds like he dicked things up. This woman sounds very nice and polite enough to entertain him and kindly move on. So if a woman is polite enough to engage someone for hours she\u2019s nuts for declining but if she wants money to meet she\u2019s a gold digger. Ladies we are damned if we do damned if we don\u2019t.",

And it\u2019s like uncomfortable question for a Starbucks!!! Or they start talking too much about sex. It\u2019s one thing to say I am a submissive is that ok? But to say so in this creepy manner I can\u2019t describe it but women know what I mean...a creepy like play by play is too much. I have literally been like this is going well then he gets overly graphic in the sex department.\n\nOh the word sensual is just like the word moist it makes you sound creepy don\u2019t use it.\n\nA thing time wasters tend to do is want to talk a lot about sex before hand and expect pictures. Some aspects of sex you have to sort out while being intimate. It\u2019s not sexy or turning a woman on to give an exact playbook. \n\nI have had this convo with other SB\u2019s we would rather just find out. I am far from a prude so far from it love swingers clubs, I\u2019ve sissy trained, I\u2019ve been a sub, I\u2019ve even done daddy/little, mmf bi but talking to a stranger in graphic detail is nauseating. Shit or get off the pot is basically what I\u2019m saying. He left her still without a gift, empty promises and I\u2019m just saying that talking to graphically about sex too soon or in the wrong setting is a serious turn off and red flag.",

So I dip a toe and she wants more - That seems against everything you are saying but she sent me suggestive pics unbidden so it seems to be working. Am I doing something wrong? Am I being scammed? Actually I know she is real because she called my Google number and walked for about 20 minutes to say goodnight. So not a scam but could be a rinser but she actually said she does not want an allowance feels transactional just wants to go shopping. Am I crazy are did I hit paydirt first time out?",

When you added the trip in there she probably started to think you had really high expectations for her and your compensation wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nAlso I\u2019m confused why you are saying she isn\u2019t stable... nothing about her demeanor or way of dealing with it seems unstable- it seems really mature and she sent you a kind message. It\u2019s also possible she didn\u2019t want to say anything on your date because she didn\u2019t know how you would react and didn\u2019t want to be publicly embarrassed. \n\nAnyways good luck finding someone.",

The over 30s are more confident, even in behaviors that are not necessarily beneficial to being in a relationship. They're less likely to show remorse or admit they might be wrong. They're less likely to think about other people and their needs and feelings. Maybe I just attract the narcissists, but in my experience, there is a clear dividing line between ladies attitudes over 30 and under 31. That's the primary reason I'm in the bowl.",

When I asked if we could talk again she asked if we could meet here again (think it was close to where she lived).\n* I didn't bring up the \"Oh, you are so exotic looking\" issue.  Her profile caption was \"Looking for a Caucasian Daddy\"...that's what I led with. I asked here why she was looking for a Caucasian guy....she took it and ran with it.\n* I remember saying something like \"My only fear is that I may not be able to take care of you like you are accustomed.\"  She said she didn't want for someone to take care of her (fooling herself maybe?) and this was just to supplement.  She was more concerned with enjoying her time together.  The one thing I'd asked was for her to be able to stay overnight at times, which would be hard for her with her kids.  She even gave me the opening to walkaway if that was important.  I told her I'd rather give up on the quantity of our time together than give up on the quality of the person I'm with....and said overnights would be nice, but not a deal breaker\n* I do think she was very emotionally involved with last SD, and when he left due to being married, it could have very well have caused her to want to have no feelings.  I am a totally feelings/emotional guy.  I'm not going to marry her, not going to control or manipulate or demand....but I would care about her.  \n\nI am in sales -- for 25 years there's always the thought that \"over time the memory of your wins will fade....but you will never forget your failures.\"  I guess that I could see how great the next few years could have been -- kinda stinks not to have a chance to live it.  \n\nOh well.....................Next!!",

I pay for her apartment, utilities. Bought her furniture and a car.  Pay her insurance.  I see her 2-3 times a month. Only problem is she\u2019s 100 miles away!  She knows I\u2019d like to find someone closer to where I live.  \n\nBut....there\u2019s no drama. None. I smile at the life lessons she learns and shares with me.  But in the end....it\u2019s mostly all physical.  We can\u2019t even go out for dinner due to her need for discretion. \n\nI wasn\u2019t looking for a girlfriend with this other lady...hopefully, though, someone closer in age and distance, more life experiences, possibly more emotional connection.  Obviously I misjudged her, misplayed the M&G, or just spilled coffee down my shirt and blew the whole thing.",

But at some point he made one comment too much and it was just too hard to continue to be nice to him. \n\nTelling him what I truly think would have required energy and I had already given him far too much IMO.

She was probably annoyed about that and that\u2019s why she changed her mind! In all seriousness I would never go on a coffee date with any POT that just shows me you\u2019re too cheap to buy dinner and this fool took her on not one but TWO coffee dates and had the nerve to keep her at Starbucks for four hours! How awkward! Ugh that\u2019s so annoying! Also another thing about coffee dates it\u2019s awkward because you don\u2019t know when the \u201cdate\u201d is over. He probably offered a cheap allowance and wanted to see her multiple times a week to get his moneys worth, when she did the math after the date and realized this man is actually cheap and wants sex that adds up to 100$ (Ball park) a session she was offended that he would even offer that in the first place and told him she\u2019s not interested. I bet I\u2019m right lol dude you could have at least taken her to lunch the second date... come on! You literally showed her you like to cut corners to save money, That\u2019s what coffee dates show me... think about it us women have to waste time money doing our hair, makeup, nails, outfit, transportation to get there, and you are willing to spend ten dollars upon our meetup? This speaks volumes on how you will be during the relationship. Food for thought, good luck!",

The SB mentioned by OP is finishing her studies which probably means another term or semester to go. And also this SB is a mum. Go think about how much money would you need to cover your child cost, housing cost, insurance for child and you, her accounting degree cost. I was in that position and my SD helped me to pay everything. I do know that the allowance she would need would be quite intense. To study and take care of a child she probably have no time to work. And in addition she would probably need to fork out for the kids childhood education.\n\nSpending 4 hours is only getting to know a person. 4 hours isnt even long enough to know a person much tbh. \n\nThe SB  cut off OP totally isn't very nice. This SB probably does not want the ping-pong exchange of negotiating the Allowance. As per what OP had said he didn't mind parting a couple more hundred as allowance for this SB. A couple hundred more wouldnt be enough to finance a degree, wouldn't be enough to feed a kid and so on and so forth. Therefore instead of exchanging such conversation with OP she had been straight up to tell him that it's the allowance and cut him off totally. I had been in a same situation years back and I know \"exactly\" how it feels. She was just being polite to what was offered by OP instead of rejecting straight in his face which is kind of ugly. In addition, this SB is a MUM OK. If she goes on holiday with the OP. She probably have to hire a nanny as well to take care of the kids. These are unseen cost. I had been there done that.\n\nOlder SB being more matured cut off op totally instead of ping pong games negotiation like how younger SB will negotiate for that 50-100 dollar more allowance. In fact most older SB don't even do PPM. I have never heard of Ppm until I come to this community. And it's a norm actually, if the allowance offered is too far from expectation there's isn't much room for negotiation so why continue to converse with this person? Lol.\n\nIn addition, I have had a bunch of long term SR SB chatting buddies who found me in this slf community and DM me to chat. They too have never heard of ppm until they come to this community.

And it\u2019s like uncomfortable question for a Starbucks!!! Or they start talking too much about sex. It\u2019s one thing to say I am a submissive is that ok? But to say so in this creepy manner I can\u2019t describe it but women know what I mean...a creepy like play by play is too much. I have literally been like this is going well then he gets overly graphic in the sex department.\n\nOh the word sensual is just like the word moist it makes you sound creepy don\u2019t use it.\n\nA thing time wasters tend to do is want to talk a lot about sex before hand and expect pictures. Some aspects of sex you have to sort out while being intimate. It\u2019s not sexy or turning a woman on to give an exact playbook. \n\nI have had this convo with other SB\u2019s we would rather just find out. I am far from a prude so far from it love swingers clubs, I\u2019ve sissy trained, I\u2019ve been a sub, I\u2019ve even done daddy/little, mmf bi but talking to a stranger in graphic detail is nauseating. Shit or get off the pot is basically what I\u2019m saying. He left her still without a gift, empty promises and I\u2019m just saying that talking to graphically about sex too soon or in the wrong setting is a serious turn off and red flag.",

So I dip a toe and she wants more - That seems against everything you are saying but she sent me suggestive pics unbidden so it seems to be working. Am I doing something wrong? Am I being scammed? Actually I know she is real because she called my Google number and walked for about 20 minutes to say goodnight. So not a scam but could be a rinser but she actually said she does not want an allowance feels transactional just wants to go shopping. Am I crazy are did I hit paydirt first time out?",

She was cool with the delay and has not mentioned any shopping items. We have talked about travel and we agree that Miami is great during spring break so no let's do this right now. I'm not a kid and feel I have a pretty good BS meter from being BS'd. One the other day wanted to sell me videos I politely declined and was ghosted afterward.

I\u2019m not anti \u201cchemistry\u201d good lord those are the best!!! Laughs, adventures, great sex and fewer bills to worry about!!

A partial allowance to take a couple weeks to feel things out, if she is a gift type maybe some perfume (i had a guy show up once with some Chanel perfume for me and chocolates for my kids!! So thoughtful and I was very appreciative) or even a gift card believe me we won\u2019t be offended!!! \n\nJust please treat our time as just as valuable as yours and remember even a small gesture can go a long way in proving you are REAL!!",

But at some point he made one comment too much and it was just too hard to continue to be nice to him. \n\nTelling him what I truly think would have required energy and I had already given him far too much IMO. Also he probably would have brushed me off and made it seem like I was being crazy, like these people usually do. So I just blocked him and carried on with my day.

In all seriousness I would never go on a coffee date with any POT that just shows me you\u2019re too cheap to buy dinner and this fool took her on not one but TWO coffee dates and had the nerve to keep her at Starbucks for four hours! How awkward! Ugh that\u2019s so annoying! Also another thing about coffee dates it\u2019s awkward because you don\u2019t know when the \u201cdate\u201d is over. He probably offered a cheap allowance and wanted to see her multiple times a week to get his moneys worth, when she did the math after the date and realized this man is actually cheap and wants sex that adds up to 100$ (Ball park) a session she was offended that he would even offer that in the first place and told him she\u2019s not interested. I bet I\u2019m right lol dude you could have at least taken her to lunch the second date... come on! You literally showed her you like to cut corners to save money, That\u2019s what coffee dates show me... think about it us women have to waste time money doing our hair, makeup, nails, outfit, transportation to get there, and you are willing to spend ten dollars upon our meetup? This speaks volumes on how you will be during the relationship. Food for thought, good luck!",

Go think about how much money would you need to cover your child cost, housing cost, insurance for child and you, her accounting degree cost. I was in that position and my SD helped me to pay everything. I do know that the allowance she would need would be quite intense. To study and take care of a child she probably have no time to work. And in addition she would probably need to fork out for the kids childhood education.\n\nSpending 4 hours is only getting to know a person. 4 hours isnt even long enough to know a person much tbh. \n\nThe SB  cut off OP totally isn't very nice. This SB probably does not want the ping-pong exchange of negotiating the Allowance. As per what OP had said he didn't mind parting a couple more hundred as allowance for this SB. A couple hundred more wouldnt be enough to finance a degree, wouldn't be enough to feed a kid and so on and so forth. Therefore instead of exchanging such conversation with OP she had been straight up to tell him that it's the allowance and cut him off totally. I had been in a same situation years back and I know \"exactly\" how it feels. She was just being polite to what was offered by OP instead of rejecting straight in his face which is kind of ugly. In addition, this SB is a MUM OK. If she goes on holiday with the OP. She probably have to hire a nanny as well to take care of the kids. These are unseen cost. I had been there done that.\n\nOlder SB being more matured cut off op totally instead of ping pong games negotiation like how younger SB will negotiate for that 50-100 dollar more allowance. In fact most older SB don't even do PPM. I have never heard of Ppm until I come to this community. And it's a norm actually, if the allowance offered is too far from expectation there's isn't much room for negotiation so why continue to converse with this person? Lol.\n\nIn addition, I have had a bunch of long term SR SB chatting buddies who found me in this slf community and DM me to chat. They too have never heard of ppm until they come to this community. Lol.",

In their mind they just have big hearts and love hard.  They move very quickly in relationships like getting engaged and living together quickly. They see any contact or interaction they have with others (including friends family and co-workers) as disloyalty. Thet make ever effort to isolate their partner from friends,  family and co-workers. They see their jealousy as normal in a loving relationship.  They see their anger and rage as justified by disloyalty. Alcohol and drug abuse is common.  Their anger and rage often leads to verbal and physical abuse.",

But to say so in this creepy manner I can\u2019t describe it but women know what I mean...a creepy like play by play is too much. I have literally been like this is going well then he gets overly graphic in the sex department.\n\nOh the word sensual is just like the word moist it makes you sound creepy don\u2019t use it.\n\nA thing time wasters tend to do is want to talk a lot about sex before hand and expect pictures. Some aspects of sex you have to sort out while being intimate. It\u2019s not sexy or turning a woman on to give an exact playbook. \n\nI have had this convo with other SB\u2019s we would rather just find out. I am far from a prude so far from it love swingers clubs, I\u2019ve sissy trained, I\u2019ve been a sub, I\u2019ve even done daddy/little, mmf bi but talking to a stranger in graphic detail is nauseating. Shit or get off the pot is basically what I\u2019m saying. He left her still without a gift, empty promises and I\u2019m just saying that talking to graphically about sex too soon or in the wrong setting is a serious turn off and red flag.",

So I dip a toe and she wants more - That seems against everything you are saying but she sent me suggestive pics unbidden so it seems to be working. Am I doing something wrong? Am I being scammed? Actually I know she is real because she called my Google number and walked for about 20 minutes to say goodnight. So not a scam but could be a rinser but she actually said she does not want an allowance feels transactional just wants to go shopping. Am I crazy are did I hit paydirt first time out?",

I\u2019m not anti \u201cchemistry\u201d good lord those are the best!!! Laughs, adventures, great sex and fewer bills to worry about!!

A partial allowance to take a couple weeks to feel things out, if she is a gift type maybe some perfume (i had a guy show up once with some Chanel perfume for me and chocolates for my kids!! So thoughtful and I was very appreciative) or even a gift card believe me we won\u2019t be offended!!! \n\nJust please treat our time as just as valuable as yours and remember even a small gesture can go a long way in proving you are REAL!!",

Most of the time was spent sharing about families, past experiences, future plans.\n\nAnd for the record, my dear, I did not pick the location. I allowed her to select the spot.  Personally I prefer something like this over dinner.  And I gag at the thought of Olive Garden.\n\nThat said.....for some reason this has struck a nerve with you as it appears you have taken on my life as a SD as your personal mission to attack.  \n\nSadly, my experience is that the one who goes overboard in their Quixote-like attack on behalf of a community like this is really indicative of someone who is home alone, continuously rejected, who all too often fabricates how perfect their life is in order to hide the sadness and failures they must live with every day.",

She was probably annoyed about that and that\u2019s why she changed her mind! In all seriousness I would never go on a coffee date with any POT that just shows me you\u2019re too cheap to buy dinner and this fool took her on not one but TWO coffee dates and had the nerve to keep her at Starbucks for four hours! How awkward! Ugh that\u2019s so annoying! Also another thing about coffee dates it\u2019s awkward because you don\u2019t know when the \u201cdate\u201d is over. He probably offered a cheap allowance and wanted to see her multiple times a week to get his moneys worth, when she did the math after the date and realized this man is actually cheap and wants sex that adds up to 100$ (Ball park) a session she was offended that he would even offer that in the first place and told him she\u2019s not interested. I bet I\u2019m right lol dude you could have at least taken her to lunch the second date... come on! You literally showed her you like to cut corners to save money, That\u2019s what coffee dates show me... think about it us women have to waste time money doing our hair, makeup, nails, outfit, transportation to get there, and you are willing to spend ten dollars upon our meetup? This speaks volumes on how you will be during the relationship. Food for thought, good luck!",

It\u2019s just too hilarious that you wrote it as if she was so wrong for saying no thank you and giving you a reason. That\u2019s not ghosting, that\u2019s not a her problem, it\u2019s a you problem. Over promised and under delivered hun face it.\n\nYou didn\u2019t deliver the goods bottom line and stop with STARBUCKS unless you want to get made fun of. I bet if you take her number Venmo her $100 and write thank you for your time I was hoping to see you again she may have a change of heart but that would mean you perfect man will have to admit you were wrong.\n\nYou aren\u2019t the catch you think you are wasting women\u2019s time like that.",

They see any contact or interaction they have with others (including friends family and co-workers) as disloyalty. Thet make ever effort to isolate their partner from friends,  family and co-workers. They see their jealousy as normal in a loving relationship.  They see their anger and rage as justified by disloyalty. Alcohol and drug abuse is common.

But anyone who isn\u2019t a newbie wether they admit it or not knows that inbox is mostly scams, bad matches, or let downs. \n\nIf you do find yourself lucky enough to feel something off the bat with a woman...remember that this is a lifestyle choice and as with any lifestyle choice there are certain unspoken rules. I\u2019m not anti \u201cchemistry\u201d good lord those are the best!!! Laughs, adventures, great sex and fewer bills to worry about!! But if you find yourself out with a true gem of a woman TAKE ACTION! Don\u2019t expect her to just get strung along end of day we both know why we are here. \n\nAs some have tried to say I\u2019m not saying give her thousands, take her to the most expensive meal or pay off her debts, but do something to show us we are appreciated!! A partial allowance to take a couple weeks to feel things out, if she is a gift type maybe some perfume (i had a guy show up once with some Chanel perfume for me and chocolates for my kids!! So thoughtful and I was very appreciative) or even a gift card believe me we won\u2019t be offended!!! \n\nJust please treat our time as just as valuable as yours and remember even a small gesture can go a long way in proving you are REAL!!",

They see any contact or interaction they have with others (including friends family and co-workers) as disloyalty. Thet make ever effort to isolate their partner from friends,  family and co-workers. They see their jealousy as normal in a loving relationship.  They see their anger and rage as justified by disloyalty. Alcohol and drug abuse is common.  Their anger and rage often leads to verbal and physical abuse.",

She was cool with the delay and has not mentioned any shopping items. We have talked about travel and we agree that Miami is great during spring break so no let's do this right now. I'm not a kid and feel I have a pretty good BS meter from being BS'd. One the other day wanted to sell me videos I politely declined and was ghosted afterward.

But anyone who isn\u2019t a newbie wether they admit it or not knows that inbox is mostly scams, bad matches, or let downs. \n\nIf you do find yourself lucky enough to feel something off the bat with a woman...remember that this is a lifestyle choice and as with any lifestyle choice there are certain unspoken rules. I\u2019m not anti \u201cchemistry\u201d good lord those are the best!!! Laughs, adventures, great sex and fewer bills to worry about!! But if you find yourself out with a true gem of a woman TAKE ACTION! Don\u2019t expect her to just get strung along end of day we both know why we are here. \n\nAs some have tried to say I\u2019m not saying give her thousands, take her to the most expensive meal or pay off her debts, but do something to show us we are appreciated!! A partial allowance to take a couple weeks to feel things out, if she is a gift type maybe some perfume (i had a guy show up once with some Chanel perfume for me and chocolates for my kids!! So thoughtful and I was very appreciative) or even a gift card believe me we won\u2019t be offended!!! \n\nJust please treat our time as just as valuable as yours and remember even a small gesture can go a long way in proving you are REAL!!",

I\u2019m not a fan of ghosting but I have blocked a potential recently, after meeting him and while we were planning our next meet. \n\nHe was an entitled jerk, also someone who had a lot of opinions about \u201cother girls\u201d on SA... usually a red flag. \n\nI was in a financial situation and usually try to focus on the good in people, so I kept talking with him and thought \u201clet\u2019s see where this goes\u201d. But at some point he made one comment too much and it was just too hard to continue to be nice to him. \n\nTelling him what I truly think would have required energy and I had already given him far too much IMO. Also he probably would have brushed me off and made it seem like I was being crazy, like these people usually do. So I just blocked him and carried on with my day. He\u2019s probably out there talking about me as the latest \u201ccrazy / stupid / unstable\u201d girl he\u2019s met, without any form of self awareness \ud83d\ude04",
