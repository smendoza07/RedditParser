I used to have long hair. For comparison.  \nPictures two and three are me at the moment with it a little longer, showing the extent of the thinning.  \nPicture four is it buzzed.  \nI'm a PhD researcher and it has basically shredded my hairline in 3 years. Sucks, but I deal with it.  \nMy question is what styles do people think are possible/suitable? To my mind, there's nothing I can really do except buzz it, but I only see it from my perspective, what do you guys say?",

So it doesn\u2019t conflict with them. But in terms of hair loss prevention. Finasteride is the heavy lifter as it works by effecting the DHT in the body. Minoxidil opens the follicles to more blood flow. Ketoconzole is great in conjunction but anyone using just ketoconzole as a hair loss prevention routine is not going to reap the benefits of what is possible with the three together.",

Forget Crunches. \n\nThe key to success, is starting light- Dont even add weight to the bar for the first week or so- you need to make sure that your movement patterns are correct. Buy a cheap, telescopic phone tripod and record yourself- review what you do. Be critical. Ask questions:\n\n\\-Are your hips twisting?\n\n\\-Are your heels raising up?\n\n\\-Is the bar keeping level?\n\nDon't worry if you dont know how to do an exercise- no one expects you to be able to drive without lessons, and training is the same. Ask instructors, but don't let them push you into paying for PT sessions, you don't need it yet. \n\nFor context, I've coached world class athletes for years, and I myself gained 80lbs of muscle over a number of years, in spite of a military career ending injury. You can do it :)",

I've coached Olympic/Paralympic Athletes and that's 'frowned upon' to say the least! \n\nPlus, there's the fact that I simply can't afford decent drugs hahaha\n\nThe Mass in picture 1 was built over a 10 year period, allowing for issues caused by a pre-existing chronic injury. Had I been using gear and was still that small, I would have asked for my money back! \n\nIt's good to see people that know about that side of things.",

Forget Crunches. \n\nThe key to success, is starting light- Dont even add weight to the bar for the first week or so- you need to make sure that your movement patterns are correct. Buy a cheap, telescopic phone tripod and record yourself- review what you do. Be critical. Ask questions:\n\n\\-Are your hips twisting?\n\n\\-Are your heels raising up?\n\n\\-Is the bar keeping level?\n\nDon't worry if you dont know how to do an exercise- no one expects you to be able to drive without lessons, and training is the same. Ask instructors, but don't let them push you into paying for PT sessions, you don't need it yet. \n\nFor context, I've coached world class athletes for years, and I myself gained 80lbs of muscle over a number of years, in spite of a military career ending injury. You can do it :)",

Lowers the chances of side effects because it\u2019s topical and has been proven to be as good as if not better than oral finasteride. The spray lasts around 1 month and is reasonably priced. May be worth looking into. I use it and it\u2019s completely changed my hairline and it\u2019s so quick and efficient to use. \n\nNizoral is good but only in conjunction with finasteride and minoxidil. Finasteride is most important then Minox then Nizoral.\n\nThat being said you look great shaved \ud83d\udc4d",

So it doesn\u2019t conflict with them. But in terms of hair loss prevention. Finasteride is the heavy lifter as it works by effecting the DHT in the body. Minoxidil opens the follicles to more blood flow. Ketoconzole is great in conjunction but anyone using just ketoconzole as a hair loss prevention routine is not going to reap the benefits of what is possible with the three together.",

Forget Crunches. \n\nThe key to success, is starting light- Dont even add weight to the bar for the first week or so- you need to make sure that your movement patterns are correct. Buy a cheap, telescopic phone tripod and record yourself- review what you do. Be critical. Ask questions:\n\n\\-Are your hips twisting?\n\n\\-Are your heels raising up?\n\n\\-Is the bar keeping level?\n\nDon't worry if you dont know how to do an exercise- no one expects you to be able to drive without lessons, and training is the same. Ask instructors, but don't let them push you into paying for PT sessions, you don't need it yet. \n\nFor context, I've coached world class athletes for years, and I myself gained 80lbs of muscle over a number of years, in spite of a military career ending injury. You can do it :)",

Lowers the chances of side effects because it\u2019s topical and has been proven to be as good as if not better than oral finasteride. The spray lasts around 1 month and is reasonably priced. May be worth looking into. I use it and it\u2019s completely changed my hairline and it\u2019s so quick and efficient to use. \n\nNizoral is good but only in conjunction with finasteride and minoxidil. Finasteride is most important then Minox then Nizoral.\n\nThat being said you look great shaved \ud83d\udc4d",

So it doesn\u2019t really apply to what I was getting at. \n\nKetoconzole works best when it\u2019s part of a regime, I mean it\u2019s a shampoo, minoxidil and finasteride aren\u2019t. So it doesn\u2019t conflict with them. But in terms of hair loss prevention. Finasteride is the heavy lifter as it works by effecting the DHT in the body. Minoxidil opens the follicles to more blood flow. Ketoconzole is great in conjunction but anyone using just ketoconzole as a hair loss prevention routine is not going to reap the benefits of what is possible with the three together.",

Forget Crunches. \n\nThe key to success, is starting light- Dont even add weight to the bar for the first week or so- you need to make sure that your movement patterns are correct. Buy a cheap, telescopic phone tripod and record yourself- review what you do. Be critical. Ask questions:\n\n\\-Are your hips twisting?\n\n\\-Are your heels raising up?\n\n\\-Is the bar keeping level?\n\nDon't worry if you dont know how to do an exercise- no one expects you to be able to drive without lessons, and training is the same. Ask instructors, but don't let them push you into paying for PT sessions, you don't need it yet. \n\nFor context, I've coached world class athletes for years, and I myself gained 80lbs of muscle over a number of years, in spite of a military career ending injury. You can do it :)",

May be worth looking into. I use it and it\u2019s completely changed my hairline and it\u2019s so quick and efficient to use. \n\nNizoral is good but only in conjunction with finasteride and minoxidil.

So it doesn\u2019t conflict with them. But in terms of hair loss prevention. Finasteride is the heavy lifter as it works by effecting the DHT in the body. Minoxidil opens the follicles to more blood flow. Ketoconzole is great in conjunction but anyone using just ketoconzole as a hair loss prevention routine is not going to reap the benefits of what is possible with the three together.",

Lowers the chances of side effects because it\u2019s topical and has been proven to be as good as if not better than oral finasteride. The spray lasts around 1 month and is reasonably priced. May be worth looking into. I use it and it\u2019s completely changed my hairline and it\u2019s so quick and efficient to use. \n\nNizoral is good but only in conjunction with finasteride and minoxidil. Finasteride is most important then Minox then Nizoral.\n\nThat being said you look great shaved \ud83d\udc4d",

So it doesn\u2019t conflict with them. But in terms of hair loss prevention. Finasteride is the heavy lifter as it works by effecting the DHT in the body. Minoxidil opens the follicles to more blood flow. Ketoconzole is great in conjunction but anyone using just ketoconzole as a hair loss prevention routine is not going to reap the benefits of what is possible with the three together.",

So it doesn\u2019t really apply to what I was getting at. \n\nKetoconzole works best when it\u2019s part of a regime, I mean it\u2019s a shampoo, minoxidil and finasteride aren\u2019t. So it doesn\u2019t conflict with them. But in terms of hair loss prevention. Finasteride is the heavy lifter as it works by effecting the DHT in the body. Minoxidil opens the follicles to more blood flow. Ketoconzole is great in conjunction but anyone using just ketoconzole as a hair loss prevention routine is not going to reap the benefits of what is possible with the three together.",

So it doesn\u2019t really apply to what I was getting at. \n\nKetoconzole works best when it\u2019s part of a regime, I mean it\u2019s a shampoo, minoxidil and finasteride aren\u2019t. So it doesn\u2019t conflict with them. But in terms of hair loss prevention. Finasteride is the heavy lifter as it works by effecting the DHT in the body. Minoxidil opens the follicles to more blood flow. Ketoconzole is great in conjunction but anyone using just ketoconzole as a hair loss prevention routine is not going to reap the benefits of what is possible with the three together.",
