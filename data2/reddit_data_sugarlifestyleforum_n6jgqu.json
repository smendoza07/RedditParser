    "body": "\n\nThe response I received for my profile wasn\u2019t the best. Wasn\u2019t getting a lot of hits and I was wondering why. I ended up changing up the pictures I had, because I ended up taking better pictures.\n\nI was told that my profile talked mainly about myself and not about what I can do for a SD. \nA \u201cSD\u201d on here even told me that no sugar daddy would ever wanna date me or something along those lines.  Then he accused me of having a fake beach background in my picture? I was told having different hairstyles confuses SD. Also in my profile I mention that I really want to explore the Amazon rainforest I was told that was odd and wouldn\u2019t appeal to a lot of sugar daddies.  And other things I can\u2019t quite remember but they weren\u2019t positive. I internalized what was said because everything in there was authentically me. I know I shouldn\u2019t have but I did anyways. \n\nI ended up standing firm in who I was and not changing the profile but just adding new pictures and manifesting lolol. \n\nI ended up getting in contact with a very sweet SD  in my area on SA. He told me that the reason why I\u2019m probably not getting a lot of hits because I had New Jersey, New Jersey as my location instead of a town in New Jersey. Because of that I wouldn\u2019t show up on a lot of searches. \n\nAfter I added a town my messages blew up. And I found that being authentically me paid off because so many of them appreciated my genuine profile. It made me wonder if talking about what you can do for a sugar daddy even really appeals to genuine kind hearted men? \nFrom what I\u2019ve seen SD who are truly interested in an arrangement and not just discreet hotel sex want to know about you, not what you can do for them. They don\u2019t need you to do anything for them they just wanna enjoy the company of interesting girl changes her hair often & wants to explore for the Amazon rain forest. LOL\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nSo currently I have a sugar daddy who\u2019s a lawyer I met off clubhouse. We see once or twice a month we have a great time. We don\u2019t have a set allowance or ppm but he\u2019s very generous. \n\nI have another one who is a VP of a Fortune 100 company. He loves the fact that I am in school for education and I want to open up a nonprofit to help kids with disabilities and he is helping me with that. He also loves the different hairstyles I can pull off hahaha. He also is very generous. He\u2019s in real estate as well and is buying a house 2 family house in a few months and wants me to stay in one of the units to watch over the property and tenets. ( haven\u2019t decide if I\u2019m going to because I\u2019m iffy about depending on a man for my housing) \n\nAnd I recently met this other sugar daddy he\u2019s the cutest out of all of them. He works for a very very popular tech company and GUESS WHAT? HE WANTS TO EXPLORE THE AMAZON WITH ME. He travels often, he\u2019s generous as well and so far he\u2019s great. \n\nAll in all I wrote this out to say be yourself don\u2019t try to put up a front. These men have years of experience they can see past BS. Don\u2019t or pretend to be someone you\u2019re not or change to be this \u201cideal sugarbaby\u201d stand firm in who you are and the good ones will appreciate it. But the key is knowing who you are as well. This isn\u2019t saying everyone\u2019s going to find a sugar daddy but standing out from the crowd & not following a generic model will definitely up your chances.",

They know they're looking for a sugar baby and not an escort they could take to a hotel for a night's intimacy! The best ones are those who actually put efforts into making you feel comfortable with them.",

Biggest pet peeve is a profile that doesn't tell me anything about \\*you\\*! \n\nIt might contain what you're looking for, some \"don't message me if\"s, and even what you bring to the table.\n\nBut when I go to find something unique to you to riff on for a first message ... nothing!\n\nI honestly next a lot of these just because coming up with the first message is taking me too long.
