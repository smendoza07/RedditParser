    "body": "What follows is a true story. No names have been changed, because no one is innocent.\n\nI\u2018ve been spending this summer in various cities around the Mediterranean. I met SB in Barcelona, dated her there, and since leaving Spain have flown her to meet me on some short trips.\n\nOur latest trip is to Saint-Tropez. It\u2019s a PITA to get to: 90m from the nearest airport with no traffic, but there\u2019s always traffic. Hardly a sexy way to start a trip.\n\nSo I put on my SD pants and hatch an amazing plan: A surprise helicopter trip from the airport to town. 20 minutes over the Mediterranean. Baller.\n\nIn true Baller fashion \u2014 or so I tell myself in the mirror \u2014 I decide to keep it a surprise. I just tell her I\u2019ll meet her at the airport, along with one of those guys with a sign with her name, and this guy will take us to Saint-Tropez. Great plan. Masterful.\n\nOn the day of, I get to the airport. Neither SB nor guy-with-sign are anywhere to be found. I figure SB\u2019s plane is delayed, which is handy, because I have to figure out where the hell my helicopter guy is. I wander around looking for him. No luck. I call the helicopter company. \u201cYes yes he\u2019s on his way.\u201d Not helpful. I plop down at baggage claim and wait for both of them.\n\nThen comes the text from SB. It\u2019s a selfie in a helicopter. Caption: \u201cYOU ARE INCREDIBLE.\u201d\n\nOh. Oh no. SB was early, helicopter guy was early, and yours truly was merely on time. The two of them assumed they were good to go, because genius planner here kept the plan to himself.\n\nThe whole Baller, Suave, Man-With-A-Plan act falls off me like a suit that never fit. Like the lost puppy I apparently am, I text back urgently:\n\n\u201dUh, great, but can you come back for me? I\u2019m still waiting at baggage claim for you\u201d\n\nSeconds pass like hours. Thoughts pass through my head: Is she already in the air? Will she be waiting for hours in a hotel lobby while I take a sad-sack taxi all the way there? In the history of sugar, has any man purporting to be a SD ever looked so weak and powerless? You get the idea.\n\nFinally, the return texts. I\u2019m sure you can imagine:\n\n\u201dWhat?\u201d \u201cRU serious??\u201d \u201dOK hang on\u201d etc.\n\nHelicopter man returns for me. He and I have a good laugh. He also has a good laugh with every single airport staffer he passes on roundtrip #2, which, fair enough. \n\nApparently SB was literally in the helicopter with the blades spinning when she got my text, so she just started yelling over the headset: \u201cWait! Wait!\u201d Pilot thinks she\u2019s having a panic attack. She has to explain to a non-English-speaker that \u201cboyfriend\u201d got himself left, and can we please power down this whole situation and go back for him?\n\nWell, friends, all\u2019s well that ends well. 20 minutes in a chopper over the Mediterranean was delightful. A couple days in Saint-Tropez with SB was a dream. My long-lasting trauma from almost getting left by my own helicopter will put food on my therapist\u2019s dinner table.\n\nAnd after all, isn\u2019t the best part of a SR the stories we have when it\u2019s all said and done? Or is it the appreciative blowjob after a surprise helicopter trip? One of those two, surely.",
