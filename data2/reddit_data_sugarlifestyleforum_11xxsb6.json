    "body": "I recently had a MG with a very young SB. She is only 19. We had chatted on Seeking, exchanged numbers, and had been texting for a week.\nThe meet was just for coffee and a conversation. It went well and ran almost 3 hours. And yes, I did compensate her for her time. That's just something I do with anyone I meet in this fashion.\n\nAs she was leaving, she handed me a small gift box, and asked that I didn't open it until she was gone.\nWhen I eventually looked inside there was a very nice pair of panties, and a note which read \"I hope to give you another pair before I turn 20\". Wow lol. A drop the mike moment.\nThat's as surprised  I have been at any MG.",

            "body": "Love her.  Would definitely hire her for a sales role.  Very creative way to get the deal closed!\n\nAn SB I met through seeking asked me before the meet and greet to tell her exactly what to wear to the meet and greet.  She added that I should buy her a pair of panties and bring them to the M&G in a perfectly wrapped gift box inside a nice bag.  She said when you first see me and walk to the table, give me a kiss, and hand me the bag.  I will be wearing what you've asked for and no panties.  I'll go to the bathroom, open them, put them on and come back to the table.  Choose well.  And if you impress me at the M&G, you will get to see them on me that night.    \n\n\nThat all happened and I got to see them.  Turned out she was very wealthy, and this was just a fantasy of hers.  Five years later, living on different continents, we still text almost every day and I may see her in April again.",

Ive primary sugar dated women 21 to 29, but my 19 year old SB was one of my best and favorite SB. Very emotionally mature, like a 30 year old, very intelligent and could converse for hours, yet so playful and fun still like someone her age. What we had was very genuine, sometimes spending whole weekends together. It was hard to believe there was over 25q+ years between us. The funny thing is, I never search on SA for under 21, I just happened to see her profile on SA main page as a new profile in my area. I was the 1st person she met off SA. Our meet and greet lasted 5 hours and was just platonic..! One of the best parts was, she initiated the 1st time we had sex on our 3rd date, and practically pushed me onto the bed ;)",

Ive primary sugar dated women 21 to 29, but my 19 year old SB was one of my best and favorite SB. Very emotionally mature, like a 30 year old, very intelligent and could converse for hours, yet so playful and fun still like someone her age. What we had was very genuine, sometimes spending whole weekends together. It was hard to believe there was over 25q+ years between us. The funny thing is, I never search on SA for under 21, I just happened to see her profile on SA main page as a new profile in my area. I was the 1st person she met off SA. Our meet and greet lasted 5 hours and was just platonic..! One of the best parts was, she initiated the 1st time we had sex on our 3rd date, and practically pushed me onto the bed ;)",

Ive primary sugar dated women 21 to 29, but my 19 year old SB was one of my best and favorite SB. Very emotionally mature, like a 30 year old, very intelligent and could converse for hours, yet so playful and fun still like someone her age. What we had was very genuine, sometimes spending whole weekends together. It was hard to believe there was over 25q+ years between us. The funny thing is, I never search on SA for under 21, I just happened to see her profile on SA main page as a new profile in my area. I was the 1st person she met off SA. Our meet and greet lasted 5 hours and was just platonic..! One of the best parts was, she initiated the 1st time we had sex on our 3rd date, and practically pushed me onto the bed ;)",
