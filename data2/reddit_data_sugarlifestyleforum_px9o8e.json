    "body": "I am very sick right now and went to the hospital a couple nights ago for a bad asthma attack that wasn't improving. I told my SD I am sick and he immediately offered to bring by fruit or soup or anything else I need, even though he's extremely busy with work this week. He's bringing by chicken noodle soup after work tonight (not to my address - I'm staying with a friend who is taking care of me) and I feel so lucky right now. It took me a couple months to find a SD but the wait was definitely worth it.",

I've began establishing boundaries in our relationship and have realized I need to leave him, especially now seeing how a real SR is supposed to be. He was my first \"real\" SD and along the way I caught feelings that make the relationship hard to leave. Truly though it's the last time. Even if he is obtuse it's not worth the irritation.",

This is not an easy path to walk if you've got low self esteem, so I'm glad to see that you've been doing better.\n\nPro tip when you're dealing with caught feelings: Just because you love and care for someone doesn't mean you have to tolerate their bad behavior. That's not love, that's enabling and being a doormat. Good luck!",

This is not an easy path to walk if you've got low self esteem, so I'm glad to see that you've been doing better.\n\nPro tip when you're dealing with caught feelings: Just because you love and care for someone doesn't mean you have to tolerate their bad behavior. That's not love, that's enabling and being a doormat. Good luck!",
