YJS agreed that LSB was a good candidate but was surprised and unsure about JSM. Even Mijoo only mentioned emotions rather than vocal skill for JSM\n\nYou can argue about it all you want. Even if JSM auditions, she'll be disqualified. Accusing me of not wanting her to participate is nonsensical and won't change the facts. I said in another comment that it would be fun if she joined for an acting project; I have nothing against her\n\nedit: word",
