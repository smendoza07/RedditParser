    "body": "On January 22nd, we celebrated our one year anniversary!\n\n\nWe both played hooky from work and took Friday off to spend the day together. SBF (M40) picked me (F27) up at home after he checked into the hotel.\u00a0\n\n\nOur M&G, one year ago, occurred at a Starbucks/shopping plaza not far from my house. He suggested we go back there and reminisce about our M&G so we did! We got coffee from Starbucks and walked around the shopping plaza just like we had done a year ago. We talked about how nervous we were and our first impressions of each other. We sat on the same bench (we think lol) and chatted for awhile.\u00a0\n\n\nWe went back to the hotel and exchanged gifts. He specifically asked for an act of service rather than a purchased gift. I baked his favorite cookies from scratch, chocolate chip. His excitement was priceless, those cookies didn't last long at all!\nHe had several gifts for me, as if he hasn't spoiled me already. The card he gave me read \"Happy You and Me Day.\" I could have melted, my heart was so warm. He gave me a hard copy of my favorite movie so I could watch it any time! Lastly, I recieved a beautiful heart shaped piece of jewelry that represents our love perfectly.\u00a0\n\n\nThe day was simple yet magical. It's been an amazing experience giving my best self to this man and receiving his best efforts in return.\n\n\nCheers to more memories, great sex and thoughtful lovers.\u00a0\n\nEDIT: Thank you for the awards and the support! When you find a good one hold on tight.",
