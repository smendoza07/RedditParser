You can tell this from basic Sakura saying \"who's that?\" Even though she's meant to be intelligent and educated. No way this bitch followed Tsunade around in the hokage building for years without ever seeing a picture of Minato. No way she doesn't know whose faces are on the Hokage cliffs. She was too blinded by Naruto being a complete badass to use her brain and remember who Minato is.\n\nOr something like that. \u00af\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af",

Then I saw in the panels and noticed sakura said \"who is he\" when minato was moving too fast and unrecognizable to anyone except naruto who can \"sense\" chakra via tails mode and he is already familiar with minato's chakra before this scene. Fast forward through a few panels, we see sakura recognizing him with edo-tensei eyes, and ended up simply wondering if he's an enemy",

It's really not fair since it's the main characters who the series was about for 700 chapters vs 2 side characters who are more times mentioned than shown and mainly exist just to push the MCs or give exposition.\n\n\nAnd yes technically you can't really measure how good a character is so technically there's no way for a character to be \"objectively better\".

It's really not fair since it's the main characters who the series was about for 700 chapters vs 2 side characters who are more times mentioned than shown and mainly exist just to push the MCs or give exposition.\n\n\nAnd yes technically you can't really measure how good a character is so technically there's no way for a character to be \"objectively better\".

Minato for example is basically a plot tool for most of the series. It's really not fair since it's the main characters who the series was about for 700 chapters vs 2 side characters who are more times mentioned than shown and mainly exist just to push the MCs or give exposition.\n\n\nAnd yes technically you can't really measure how good a character is so technically there's no way for a character to be \"objectively better\". But with that logic it's like saying \"Hashirama can't be objectively a better person than Danzo since you can't measure how good someone is\"",

Minato for example is basically a plot tool for most of the series. It's really not fair since it's the main characters who the series was about for 700 chapters vs 2 side characters who are more times mentioned than shown and mainly exist just to push the MCs or give exposition.\n\n\nAnd yes technically you can't really measure how good a character is so technically there's no way for a character to be \"objectively better\". But with that logic it's like saying \"Hashirama can't be objectively a better person than Danzo since you can't measure how good someone is\"",
