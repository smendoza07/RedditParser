I've tried a bunch of different ones, but settled on [Got2B](https://express.google.com/u/0/product/8207045675818843311_16684949261433537912_10037?utm_source=google_shopping&utm_medium=tu_cu&utm_content=eid-lsjeuxoeqt&gtim=CMa88ZXdnc2hvAEQ1M6frqjBrNS2ARiw0aoDIgNVU0QooJOr4QUwtU4&utm_campaign=10037&gclid=CjwKCAiAu_LgBRBdEiwAkovNsHYhqpC9SrTXYMghZTOUfWGBbNgrB5AfOiqrHD1yno4i5HesVhtxahoCkx4QAvD_BwE).\n\nYour hair won't look frizzy and puffy, but instead will have a nice moldable matte look.\n\nOnce you leave the shower, towel dry your head, but not completely. Make sure your hair is damp, but not wet enough that it's too heavy flops right down. If I  had to choose, I'd want my hair more on the wet side than the dry. \n\nNow, try a nickel sized amount of whatever wax you buy and rub it between your fingers on both hands. My hair is longer than yours, so I need a bit more. But you can always mess around with the amount.\n\nThen, run your hands through your hair at a bunch of different angles, for 10 seconds or so, until you get wax on pretty much all of your hair. Style it as you'd like.\n\nLet your hair air dry until it almost feels stiffish (shouldn't take long at all if you dried it the proper amount out of the shower), then run your fingers through your hair and on top of it (if you did a combover or something) so you don't mess it up. This will get rid of the stiffness and shininess. You'll get left with a matte look that you can still manipulate. If you need to, you can use more water at this point or later in the day to adjust.\n\nGood luck!",

Glad you are happy with my observation.\n\n1)\nFor the interim style I'd say you should just tell your barber you'd like to grow out the top of your hair so they don't need to take too much off of it other than to keep it maintained.\nFor the sides just get a standard cut and trim of what you normally get but ask them blend it into the length you have at the top so that when you get hair long enough to comb back it won't be a total undercut but if you do get an undercut once in a while it's not that big a deal because hair on the sides grows quick enough anyway.\n\n2)\nI would say that the guy has used a blow dryer for that style but it's not required to get the effect. The main thing it does is make your hair stand up a bit more.\nI would achieve the style he has by keeping moisture in my hair by not using too much shampoo during the week, which will make your hair have more hold when you comb it back.\nDon't use a comb on the top too, get one of those round headed brushes with the bristles because when you pull it back it'll create more lift with those nice lines.\nFor product I'm not sure on specifics but maybe someone else can help with which ones to buy.\nFoam mousse is good but you need a blow dryer for it to work. Looks very natural when you do it too.\n",

American crew fiber that is often recommended on here has high hold and low shine for example. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn general I think your hair is perfectly fine as is. I'd just add some product for some texture and you'll be good to go. Otherwise just google hairstyles for men until you find something you like and think would fit you.

I've tried a bunch of different ones, but settled on [Got2B](https://express.google.com/u/0/product/8207045675818843311_16684949261433537912_10037?utm_source=google_shopping&utm_medium=tu_cu&utm_content=eid-lsjeuxoeqt&gtim=CMa88ZXdnc2hvAEQ1M6frqjBrNS2ARiw0aoDIgNVU0QooJOr4QUwtU4&utm_campaign=10037&gclid=CjwKCAiAu_LgBRBdEiwAkovNsHYhqpC9SrTXYMghZTOUfWGBbNgrB5AfOiqrHD1yno4i5HesVhtxahoCkx4QAvD_BwE).\n\nYour hair won't look frizzy and puffy, but instead will have a nice moldable matte look.\n\nOnce you leave the shower, towel dry your head, but not completely. Make sure your hair is damp, but not wet enough that it's too heavy flops right down. If I  had to choose, I'd want my hair more on the wet side than the dry. \n\nNow, try a nickel sized amount of whatever wax you buy and rub it between your fingers on both hands. My hair is longer than yours, so I need a bit more. But you can always mess around with the amount.\n\nThen, run your hands through your hair at a bunch of different angles, for 10 seconds or so, until you get wax on pretty much all of your hair. Style it as you'd like.\n\nLet your hair air dry until it almost feels stiffish (shouldn't take long at all if you dried it the proper amount out of the shower), then run your fingers through your hair and on top of it (if you did a combover or something) so you don't mess it up. This will get rid of the stiffness and shininess. You'll get left with a matte look that you can still manipulate. If you need to, you can use more water at this point or later in the day to adjust.\n\nGood luck!",

Glad you are happy with my observation.\n\n1)\nFor the interim style I'd say you should just tell your barber you'd like to grow out the top of your hair so they don't need to take too much off of it other than to keep it maintained.\nFor the sides just get a standard cut and trim of what you normally get but ask them blend it into the length you have at the top so that when you get hair long enough to comb back it won't be a total undercut but if you do get an undercut once in a while it's not that big a deal because hair on the sides grows quick enough anyway.\n\n2)\nI would say that the guy has used a blow dryer for that style but it's not required to get the effect. The main thing it does is make your hair stand up a bit more.\nI would achieve the style he has by keeping moisture in my hair by not using too much shampoo during the week, which will make your hair have more hold when you comb it back.\nDon't use a comb on the top too, get one of those round headed brushes with the bristles because when you pull it back it'll create more lift with those nice lines.\nFor product I'm not sure on specifics but maybe someone else can help with which ones to buy.\nFoam mousse is good but you need a blow dryer for it to work. Looks very natural when you do it too.\n",

Hair products come in a ton of different versions, low to high shine and low to high hold and everything in between. Pomade has high shine and often lower hold while clay has low shine and more often higher hold. American crew fiber that is often recommended on here has high hold and low shine for example. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn general I think your hair is perfectly fine as is. I'd just add some product for some texture and you'll be good to go. Otherwise just google hairstyles for men until you find something you like and think would fit you.

Make sure your hair is damp, but not wet enough that it's too heavy flops right down. If I  had to choose, I'd want my hair more on the wet side than the dry. \n\nNow, try a nickel sized amount of whatever wax you buy and rub it between your fingers on both hands. My hair is longer than yours, so I need a bit more. But you can always mess around with the amount.\n\nThen, run your hands through your hair at a bunch of different angles, for 10 seconds or so, until you get wax on pretty much all of your hair. Style it as you'd like.\n\nLet your hair air dry until it almost feels stiffish (shouldn't take long at all if you dried it the proper amount out of the shower), then run your fingers through your hair and on top of it (if you did a combover or something) so you don't mess it up. This will get rid of the stiffness and shininess. You'll get left with a matte look that you can still manipulate. If you need to, you can use more water at this point or later in the day to adjust.\n\nGood luck!",

Glad you are happy with my observation.\n\n1)\nFor the interim style I'd say you should just tell your barber you'd like to grow out the top of your hair so they don't need to take too much off of it other than to keep it maintained.\nFor the sides just get a standard cut and trim of what you normally get but ask them blend it into the length you have at the top so that when you get hair long enough to comb back it won't be a total undercut but if you do get an undercut once in a while it's not that big a deal because hair on the sides grows quick enough anyway.\n\n2)\nI would say that the guy has used a blow dryer for that style but it's not required to get the effect. The main thing it does is make your hair stand up a bit more.\nI would achieve the style he has by keeping moisture in my hair by not using too much shampoo during the week, which will make your hair have more hold when you comb it back.\nDon't use a comb on the top too, get one of those round headed brushes with the bristles because when you pull it back it'll create more lift with those nice lines.\nFor product I'm not sure on specifics but maybe someone else can help with which ones to buy.\nFoam mousse is good but you need a blow dryer for it to work. Looks very natural when you do it too.\n",

Hair products come in a ton of different versions, low to high shine and low to high hold and everything in between. Pomade has high shine and often lower hold while clay has low shine and more often higher hold. American crew fiber that is often recommended on here has high hold and low shine for example. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn general I think your hair is perfectly fine as is. I'd just add some product for some texture and you'll be good to go. Otherwise just google hairstyles for men until you find something you like and think would fit you.

Make sure your hair is damp, but not wet enough that it's too heavy flops right down. If I  had to choose, I'd want my hair more on the wet side than the dry. \n\nNow, try a nickel sized amount of whatever wax you buy and rub it between your fingers on both hands. My hair is longer than yours, so I need a bit more. But you can always mess around with the amount.\n\nThen, run your hands through your hair at a bunch of different angles, for 10 seconds or so, until you get wax on pretty much all of your hair. Style it as you'd like.\n\nLet your hair air dry until it almost feels stiffish (shouldn't take long at all if you dried it the proper amount out of the shower), then run your fingers through your hair and on top of it (if you did a combover or something) so you don't mess it up. This will get rid of the stiffness and shininess. You'll get left with a matte look that you can still manipulate. If you need to, you can use more water at this point or later in the day to adjust.\n\nGood luck!",
