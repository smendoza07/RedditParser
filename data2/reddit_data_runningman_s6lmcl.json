But to be honest, I understand why HaHA would prefer HDYP compare to RM nowadays bcs of long term project such as Acorn Concert in HDYP is much more memorable & unique, which he alongside with Jae Suk & Mi Joo also recorded a new song under the name 'Toyote.'\n\nIt's been a long time since Running Man had a long term project such as Fan meeting concert. Hopefully the PD's can think any interesting project for this year!",

Probably because you're commenting in the RM subreddit so saying anything against it could lead to downvotes. \n\nBut seeing that RM is still running, they're still being watched enough that SBS still earns money from the show, as well as the cast members. Also, they have a much greater audience abroad (in numbers) compared in SK since they have garnered enough loyal fans all over the world for the past 11 years, and SK has tons of new variety shows already.\n\nThough nothing lasts forever, I think RM is still in good standing now; better than most people think.",

However I wouldn\u2019t say HYDP are significantly higher to the point of being close to the success of Infinite Challenge in its heyday. They have continued to hover between 6-8 which is pretty good, but also is lower than other programs such as 2D1N or even Ugly Duckling which consistently have over 10+. \n\nHowever, I think there\u2019s a misconception that RMs viewership is low. According to this [article](https://n.news.naver.com/article/006/0000111384) recently published on Naver, Running Man ranked fourth in Korean viewership usage time on OTT content in 2021 only falling behind three dramas - Squid games, Hospital Playlist and Hometown Cha Cha. This is a rather impressive feat for an almost 12 year old show and shows there\u2019s certainly a lot of life left and viewers still following the show.\n\nEdit: grammar",

However I wouldn\u2019t say HYDP are significantly higher to the point of being close to the success of Infinite Challenge in its heyday. They have continued to hover between 6-8 which is pretty good, but also is lower than other programs such as 2D1N or even Ugly Duckling which consistently have over 10+. \n\nHowever, I think there\u2019s a misconception that RMs viewership is low. According to this [article](https://n.news.naver.com/article/006/0000111384) recently published on Naver, Running Man ranked fourth in Korean viewership usage time on OTT content in 2021 only falling behind three dramas - Squid games, Hospital Playlist and Hometown Cha Cha. This is a rather impressive feat for an almost 12 year old show and shows there\u2019s certainly a lot of life left and viewers still following the show.\n\nEdit: grammar",
