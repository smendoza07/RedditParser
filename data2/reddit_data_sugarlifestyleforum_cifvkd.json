    "body": "Last August, I decided to try to be a SB. Honestly, it was not a good decision for me. I was in a bad place, hated myself, and had lost control of my life. Up until July of last year, I was doing great. Had a great job, making it on my own and literally within a day, it all fell apart. I lost my job. It affected me more than I would admit. To go from doing so well to having to move back in with my mother ,at 34 years old was devastating. I'm not sure what I was thinking jumping into a lifestyle I knew absolutely nothing about, and was not prepared for, mentally or physically. My attitude, confidence, and self esteem were at rock bottom. \nWe all know that is a terrible combination for the bowl.  The rejection based on my appearance made it worse. I have a bad habit of continuing to do something even though it hurts me. I'm some sort of masochist. The only thing wrong with my appearance, the one thing that makes me undesirable ,is my weight. I knew that going in but I figured what the hell. My life at that point already sucked and I was already hurting so why not add more to it. I allowed myself to be used, just like I always do. I was accepting any attention from any man on SA because I knew I did not have room to be picky. I was never hurt physically or in danger but definitely was allowing mistreatment, all because I had the mentality that I should just feel blessed this guy was giving the fat girl a chance. \n\nNow for the positive part of the story. There was a SD in this forum that friended me. He had messaged me after reading a post I had made. We became friends and still are. He didn't judge me or count me out. He talked to me, he supported me, he encouraged me (still does). Had I not decided to do this, I wouldn't have met him. I truly believe we were meant to cross paths. He opened my eyes. I stopped beating myself up. I took control of what I could and dealt with it. When I started being positive, things began to get better. At the end of December, he flew me to see him. Couldn't believe it was happening. I was terrified, excited, nervous, and elated. Stepped off of the plane, met him at baggage claim. Even though he knew what I looked like, and he knew I was overweight and told me over and over that he was fine with it, I just knew he was going to take one look at me and run for the hills. However, that did not happen. First thing he said was I was even better in person than in my pictures. \n\nBefore I go into this part, everything I'm about to share was pre-discussed and agreed upon by both of us. He is dominant and I'm submissive. So, he was in control. We didn't leave the airport right away. There was a Starbucks, we had coffee and talked. He wanted me to have a chance to breath and calm down. My nerves were going crazy. He talked me through it. Part of what he wanted to help me with was my confidence. He had purchased  all the clothes I needed for my trip prior to me arriving. Clothes I would never buy for myself or even consider wearing because of my body. He handed me a bag, and in it was a strapless black dress. I hated that walked to the bathroom to put that dress on lol I wanted to cry when I put it on, but standing in that stall and being afraid was pointless.  I walked out of that bathroom with my head held high, rocking that dress, even though I was afraid. People stared and I'm sure most of them were thinking , my God, what is this girl doing wearing that at her weight. It hit me that it didn't matter what they thought. Their opinion of my appearance did not invalidate me. That is what he wanted me to understand. So to make a long story short, the week was amazing. We talk most every day  and I will see him again. I also have another friend I made here and there is talk of us meeting one day. He is just as amazing. \n\nI went into all of that to say this. The bowl has actually been a life saver for me. I came into it at the wrong time in my life but it has changed me for the better. It has given me the motivation I've needed to better myself. I'm losing weight, I'm happier, I found a great job and my self esteem has increased tremendously and I've stopped accepting poor treatment just because it was attention. It has taught me my worth is not validated by others and has made me finally accept others opinions of me are not my business and don't mean a damn thing. The people that want to be a part of my life( in general and in the bowl) will  stay no matter if I'm fat ,thin, green, purple, or have fish scales. And it's perfectly ok if someone does not find you attractive. So, that choice I made back in August to jump into the bowl turned out to be one of the best things I did for myself. I'm not saying it's like this for everyone but for me, it has been. I'm excited about where I'll go from here. If you made it this far, you are awesome. I know it's a long post ;)",
