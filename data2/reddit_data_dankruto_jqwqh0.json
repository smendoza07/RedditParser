And only one of them died! \n\nAlso, Kaguya never really used her powers optimally. Didn\u2019t she have a dimension made of gravity or something? Couldn\u2019t she have just teleported the whole Naru-squad there and teleported out? Then just wait 10 minutes or so and they\u2019ve already shat out their spines. Isn\u2019t that basically a better version of what Obito was doing throughout the entire show? Trap them in my pocket dimension, and then they die because they can\u2019t get out.\n\n...Although to be honest, despite everything, the Harem Jutsu thing was pretty funny, and to Kaguya, must have been really confusing. She basically created chakra, and in the middle of a god-level battle to decide the fate of the world, Naruto randomly decides to use it to pull out a bunch of naked dudes. Her face was basically if, \u201c...Wait, what the fuck?!\u201d was an expression. It\u2019s kinda like showing Henry Ford r/dragonsfuckingcars. I think. Okay, it may not be a totally accurate comparison, but it\u2019s more in concept.",

And it went on for very very VERY long time, by the time the anime ended, I just watched the short version on youtube and was glad I stopped and went browsing other anime.\n\nThe original series is still my number one anime but I can't watch Madara/Kaguya arc because of how stupidly ridiculous it made the series and power levels.",

People needs to understand that those two are support characters. Which means they are awesome for keeping their team alive. Which is awesome, that's why if you have Sakura or Tsunade in your team, you will almost never lose, coz she will heal you and give you Chakra all the time. But they aren't good in 1v1s. They aren't meant to be good in 1v1s. They are people who saying Kakashi is weaker than Tsunade, which is just ridiculous, since in early Naruto, Kabuto literally wiped the floor with Tsunade and there is no way that THAT Kabuto is stronger than Kakashi after the war. No way. So yes, Kakashi would beat Tsunade. But this doesn't makes her weak. People have to understand, that support charakters aren't meant to be 1v1 fighters. They boost their team, making them almost immortal with almost infinite chakra. Like bruh, what do you need more? So that's the power of Sakura and Tsunade.",

However, I think that Kakashi in general is stronger than her. That\u2019s not to say that he would win, but without healing powers, Sakura isn\u2019t boxing with Kakashi unless he\u2019s pre-Kamui. In their strongest forms, Sakura is getting bodied by DMS Kakashi. The way Sakura wins any fights against Kakashi is through stamina, not actual strength. As for Sakura in Boruto, I think she could beat Kakashi but I\u2019m not sure because I didn\u2019t watch much of it. Although Kakashi now has the stamina that he was lacking with the sharingan, he no longer has it along with kamui, which gave him an edge.",

There is low Kage, mid Kage, high Kage, high Kage+, then top tier before god. Top tier hosts all people relative to sage Hashirama, like KCM2 Sage mode Naruto, Rinnegan revived Madara(only person stronger than sage Hashi) KCM minato and the like. High Kage tier are those that are above high Kage, but barely reach top tier, like Base minato, kcm1 and 2 Naruto, maybe he third Raikage. I think you can figure out the rest from there",

And only one of them died! \n\nAlso, Kaguya never really used her powers optimally. Didn\u2019t she have a dimension made of gravity or something? Couldn\u2019t she have just teleported the whole Naru-squad there and teleported out? Then just wait 10 minutes or so and they\u2019ve already shat out their spines. Isn\u2019t that basically a better version of what Obito was doing throughout the entire show? Trap them in my pocket dimension, and then they die because they can\u2019t get out.\n\n...Although to be honest, despite everything, the Harem Jutsu thing was pretty funny, and to Kaguya, must have been really confusing. She basically created chakra, and in the middle of a god-level battle to decide the fate of the world, Naruto randomly decides to use it to pull out a bunch of naked dudes. Her face was basically if, \u201c...Wait, what the fuck?!\u201d was an expression. It\u2019s kinda like showing Henry Ford r/dragonsfuckingcars. I think.

People needs to understand that those two are support characters. Which means they are awesome for keeping their team alive. Which is awesome, that's why if you have Sakura or Tsunade in your team, you will almost never lose, coz she will heal you and give you Chakra all the time. But they aren't good in 1v1s. They aren't meant to be good in 1v1s. They are people who saying Kakashi is weaker than Tsunade, which is just ridiculous, since in early Naruto, Kabuto literally wiped the floor with Tsunade and there is no way that THAT Kabuto is stronger than Kakashi after the war. No way. So yes, Kakashi would beat Tsunade. But this doesn't makes her weak. People have to understand, that support charakters aren't meant to be 1v1 fighters. They boost their team, making them almost immortal with almost infinite chakra. Like bruh, what do you need more? So that's the power of Sakura and Tsunade.",

However, I think that Kakashi in general is stronger than her. That\u2019s not to say that he would win, but without healing powers, Sakura isn\u2019t boxing with Kakashi unless he\u2019s pre-Kamui. In their strongest forms, Sakura is getting bodied by DMS Kakashi. The way Sakura wins any fights against Kakashi is through stamina, not actual strength. As for Sakura in Boruto, I think she could beat Kakashi but I\u2019m not sure because I didn\u2019t watch much of it. Although Kakashi now has the stamina that he was lacking with the sharingan, he no longer has it along with kamui, which gave him an edge.",

And only one of them died! \n\nAlso, Kaguya never really used her powers optimally. Didn\u2019t she have a dimension made of gravity or something? Couldn\u2019t she have just teleported the whole Naru-squad there and teleported out? Then just wait 10 minutes or so and they\u2019ve already shat out their spines. Isn\u2019t that basically a better version of what Obito was doing throughout the entire show? Trap them in my pocket dimension, and then they die because they can\u2019t get out.\n\n...Although to be honest, despite everything, the Harem Jutsu thing was pretty funny, and to Kaguya, must have been really confusing. She basically created chakra, and in the middle of a god-level battle to decide the fate of the world, Naruto randomly decides to use it to pull out a bunch of naked dudes. Her face was basically if, \u201c...Wait, what the fuck?!\u201d was an expression. It\u2019s kinda like showing Henry Ford r/dragonsfuckingcars. I think.

That\u2019s not to say that he would win, but without healing powers, Sakura isn\u2019t boxing with Kakashi unless he\u2019s pre-Kamui. In their strongest forms, Sakura is getting bodied by DMS Kakashi. The way Sakura wins any fights against Kakashi is through stamina, not actual strength. As for Sakura in Boruto, I think she could beat Kakashi but I\u2019m not sure because I didn\u2019t watch much of it. Although Kakashi now has the stamina that he was lacking with the sharingan, he no longer has it along with kamui, which gave him an edge.",

There is low Kage, mid Kage, high Kage, high Kage+, then top tier before god. Top tier hosts all people relative to sage Hashirama, like KCM2 Sage mode Naruto, Rinnegan revived Madara(only person stronger than sage Hashi) KCM minato and the like. High Kage tier are those that are above high Kage, but barely reach top tier, like Base minato, kcm1 and 2 Naruto, maybe he third Raikage. I think you can figure out the rest from there",

High Kage tier are those that are above high Kage, but barely reach top tier, like Base minato, kcm1 and 2 Naruto, maybe he third Raikage. I think you can figure out the rest from there",
