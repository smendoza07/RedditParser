It says so 100% in the databooks and those are written by Kishimoto.\n\nIf he would have gotten Hashirama cells from Kabuto, we would have seen either Kabuto or Sasuke listed as wood style users in the 4th databook character sheets or at least seen one of them use wood style/have crazy healing on screen or on panel.\n\nIt's just that Orochimaru's snake cells happen to be white like Hashi cells, hence the confusion. Kabuto probably did some flesh transfer like Jugo, since we know for sure he has Jugo's abilities.\n\nAnd also, I was under the impression for a while that the Rinnegan awakening might have been triggered when Hashirama gave Sasuke his chakra for a jutsu to bind Madara, before he gets stabbed by Madara. But no, that's not it either, because Hashirama was no longer an Ashura incarnation at that point, so he no longer has Ashura chakra.\n\nAnd i think that since Hagoromo gave Sasuke and Naruto a half of his Six Paths chakra each, that's why Sasuke only has one Rinnegan. If he would have gotten Ashura chakra he would have had both Rinnegan like Madara.",

That they recieved it from Hagoromo doesn't make it more special. Six Paths chakra, either by mixing Indra and Ashura chakra or directly getting the end product from Hagoromo, is no different. And in Naruto's case, since he just recieved the ability to enter SP Sage Mode, becoming a TenTails jinchuuriki wouldn't grant him that anymore since he already has it. The best way to compare them is strip down the similar power-ups and compare them in base. Madara still ends up as the stronger TenTails Jinchuuriki of the 3, if all 3 were to be TenTails Jinchuurikis.",

He also is noted to have insanely high chakra reserves, much higher than Kakashi, in the very first arc. \n\nNaruto was never an underdog in terms of potential power, so when people get surprised that he actually is able to use that power later on in the series (which he worked hard to control, mind you) they somehow say something was contradicted?\n\nYou don\u2019t write a hard work > talent story when the MC is shown to have enormous gifts since the very beginning. \n\nI think the trouble people have is not understanding that hard work and natural gifts are NOT mutually exclusive. Lebron James works just as hard, if not harder than his peers, even though he was blessed physically.\n\nPeople also struggle to understand nuance. Naruto was weak IN BASE for the entire beginning of the series. And so he was a \u201cperceived\u201d underdog when not in use of the 9 tails chakra. Obviously as readers we know of his potential, from the times 9 tails slips out. Nearly all of Naruto\u2019s part 1 come with him using Kurama\n\nHaku? Check\n\nOrochimaru? Check\n\nKiba? Fart\n\nNeji? Check\n\nGaara? Check\n\nSasuke? Check.\n\nNaruto\u2019s main struggle was from a social aspect and learning to control the burden of the ninetails to TURN it into the gift that it always had the potential to be\n\nEdit: Naruto\u2019s base form was actively being hindered by the 9tails. As Kakshi states, Naruto\u2019s chakra would be 25x stronger if he hadn\u2019t been using a lot to keep the 9 tails held back. Lots of Naruto\u2019s early troubles and his \u201cfailure\u201d in base was due to this lack of chakra control caused by the 9tails. \n\nThis plot thread is addressed in shippuden, when Naruto realizes that HE needs to get stronger, and not rely on the ninetails, as it comes with great side affects. Many other characters, such as Orochimaru, state that Naruto is nothing without his tailed beast. That was the point being him learning the rasenshuriken, and him being adamant on taking Kakazu out on his own, in order to prove his own power to himself.",

This was also the only point where hashirama stopped being able to dominate the battlefield. \n\nSo Gai truly did become one of the strongest ninja to live simply by working the absolute hardest for the longest. Even 7 gates is a problem for most of the iconic characters in Naruto, considering that it makes Gai stronger than a lot of the jinchurikis. Gai is literally top 10 shinobi of all time, easily - and thats with 0 talent at all, just pure attitude/work ethic.",

What you could say it does push is, even if you have no talent, through extreme hard work, you could become a splendid shinobi.\nThe similarities between Lee\u2019s fight and Guys fight are I think purposeful.\n\nBoth pure hard worker, up against a natural gifted beast. Though they both LOSE, they prove that, through taijutsu alone and insane amounts of effort, they could become strong and splendid shinobi. I\u2019m sure all of us were proud of what they could accomplish, and didn\u2019t see them as losers just because they lost. They even both get crippled at the end (tho I wish Guy actually died (even tho I live him) because his sacrifice would\u2019ve meant more).",

Not everyone can be the best, but everyone can be the best version of themselves- and just by doing that you enter that top 5% of people, because regardless of your (lack of) endowments or talents, you\u2019ve got what no one else has - the actual drive and dedication to reach mastery. That beats even the people with the greatest of talents when talent doesnt work hard. And shit, did Lee get crippled too?! I don\u2019t remember that bit. \n\nI agree, maybe gai should have died but i am also happy that he\u2019s got to see the peacetime the war created. At least he wouldnt have died in vein like my boy Neji. They didnt have to do my boy Neji like that. \n\nBut overall i agree with your point. The way the plot goes makes it very hard to argue hard work > talent. I think the more important point is to actually realise our talents - because everyone is unique and that was something i liked about the naruto characters. They all had their quirks and they embraced their individuality. For example, shikamaru was the strategist, Choji liked to eat, Hinata was kind, Sakura could heal, Neji was wise, Lee had spirit etc.",

It says so 100% in the databooks and those are written by Kishimoto.\n\nIf he would have gotten Hashirama cells from Kabuto, we would have seen either Kabuto or Sasuke listed as wood style users in the 4th databook character sheets or at least seen one of them use wood style/have crazy healing on screen or on panel.\n\nIt's just that Orochimaru's snake cells happen to be white like Hashi cells, hence the confusion. Kabuto probably did some flesh transfer like Jugo, since we know for sure he has Jugo's abilities.\n\nAnd also, I was under the impression for a while that the Rinnegan awakening might have been triggered when Hashirama gave Sasuke his chakra for a jutsu to bind Madara, before he gets stabbed by Madara. But no, that's not it either, because Hashirama was no longer an Ashura incarnation at that point, so he no longer has Ashura chakra.\n\nAnd i think that since Hagoromo gave Sasuke and Naruto a half of his Six Paths chakra each, that's why Sasuke only has one Rinnegan. If he would have gotten Ashura chakra he would have had both Rinnegan like Madara.",

So before he gets the arm) and I sadly couldn't find anything in the Last and Boruto Moviebooks or the Boruto databook on Naruto having the ability to use wood style, probably because those 3 books are pretty sparse in technical information, but he very obviously can use wood style, I don't think there can be any confusion about that if he has an arm of Hashi cells.\n\nAnd I don't think if they were a TenTails jinchuuriki they would be more monstrous than Madara was, since Madara already had Six Paths chakra before becoming TenTails jinchuuriki, just as they did. That they recieved it from Hagoromo doesn't make it more special. Six Paths chakra, either by mixing Indra and Ashura chakra or directly getting the end product from Hagoromo, is no different. And in Naruto's case, since he just recieved the ability to enter SP Sage Mode, becoming a TenTails jinchuuriki wouldn't grant him that anymore since he already has it. The best way to compare them is strip down the similar power-ups and compare them in base. Madara still ends up as the stronger TenTails Jinchuuriki of the 3, if all 3 were to be TenTails Jinchuurikis.",

He also is noted to have insanely high chakra reserves, much higher than Kakashi, in the very first arc. \n\nNaruto was never an underdog in terms of potential power, so when people get surprised that he actually is able to use that power later on in the series (which he worked hard to control, mind you) they somehow say something was contradicted?\n\nYou don\u2019t write a hard work > talent story when the MC is shown to have enormous gifts since the very beginning. \n\nI think the trouble people have is not understanding that hard work and natural gifts are NOT mutually exclusive. Lebron James works just as hard, if not harder than his peers, even though he was blessed physically.\n\nPeople also struggle to understand nuance. Naruto was weak IN BASE for the entire beginning of the series. And so he was a \u201cperceived\u201d underdog when not in use of the 9 tails chakra. Obviously as readers we know of his potential, from the times 9 tails slips out. Nearly all of Naruto\u2019s part 1 come with him using Kurama\n\nHaku? Check\n\nOrochimaru? Check\n\nKiba? Fart\n\nNeji? Check\n\nGaara? Check\n\nSasuke? Check.\n\nNaruto\u2019s main struggle was from a social aspect and learning to control the burden of the ninetails to TURN it into the gift that it always had the potential to be\n\nEdit: Naruto\u2019s base form was actively being hindered by the 9tails. As Kakshi states, Naruto\u2019s chakra would be 25x stronger if he hadn\u2019t been using a lot to keep the 9 tails held back. Lots of Naruto\u2019s early troubles and his \u201cfailure\u201d in base was due to this lack of chakra control caused by the 9tails. \n\nThis plot thread is addressed in shippuden, when Naruto realizes that HE needs to get stronger, and not rely on the ninetails, as it comes with great side affects. Many other characters, such as Orochimaru, state that Naruto is nothing without his tailed beast. That was the point being him learning the rasenshuriken, and him being adamant on taking Kakazu out on his own, in order to prove his own power to himself.",

I\u2019m sure all of us were proud of what they could accomplish, and didn\u2019t see them as losers just because they lost.

Not everyone can be the best, but everyone can be the best version of themselves- and just by doing that you enter that top 5% of people, because regardless of your (lack of) endowments or talents, you\u2019ve got what no one else has - the actual drive and dedication to reach mastery. That beats even the people with the greatest of talents when talent doesnt work hard. And shit, did Lee get crippled too?! I don\u2019t remember that bit. \n\nI agree, maybe gai should have died but i am also happy that he\u2019s got to see the peacetime the war created. At least he wouldnt have died in vein like my boy Neji. They didnt have to do my boy Neji like that. \n\nBut overall i agree with your point. The way the plot goes makes it very hard to argue hard work > talent. I think the more important point is to actually realise our talents - because everyone is unique and that was something i liked about the naruto characters. They all had their quirks and they embraced their individuality. For example, shikamaru was the strategist, Choji liked to eat, Hinata was kind, Sakura could heal, Neji was wise, Lee had spirit etc.",

It says so 100% in the databooks and those are written by Kishimoto.\n\nIf he would have gotten Hashirama cells from Kabuto, we would have seen either Kabuto or Sasuke listed as wood style users in the 4th databook character sheets or at least seen one of them use wood style/have crazy healing on screen or on panel.\n\nIt's just that Orochimaru's snake cells happen to be white like Hashi cells, hence the confusion. Kabuto probably did some flesh transfer like Jugo, since we know for sure he has Jugo's abilities.\n\nAnd also, I was under the impression for a while that the Rinnegan awakening might have been triggered when Hashirama gave Sasuke his chakra for a jutsu to bind Madara, before he gets stabbed by Madara. But no, that's not it either, because Hashirama was no longer an Ashura incarnation at that point, so he no longer has Ashura chakra.\n\nAnd i think that since Hagoromo gave Sasuke and Naruto a half of his Six Paths chakra each, that's why Sasuke only has one Rinnegan. If he would have gotten Ashura chakra he would have had both Rinnegan like Madara.",

So before he gets the arm) and I sadly couldn't find anything in the Last and Boruto Moviebooks or the Boruto databook on Naruto having the ability to use wood style, probably because those 3 books are pretty sparse in technical information, but he very obviously can use wood style, I don't think there can be any confusion about that if he has an arm of Hashi cells.\n\nAnd I don't think if they were a TenTails jinchuuriki they would be more monstrous than Madara was, since Madara already had Six Paths chakra before becoming TenTails jinchuuriki, just as they did. That they recieved it from Hagoromo doesn't make it more special. Six Paths chakra, either by mixing Indra and Ashura chakra or directly getting the end product from Hagoromo, is no different. And in Naruto's case, since he just recieved the ability to enter SP Sage Mode, becoming a TenTails jinchuuriki wouldn't grant him that anymore since he already has it. The best way to compare them is strip down the similar power-ups and compare them in base. Madara still ends up as the stronger TenTails Jinchuuriki of the 3, if all 3 were to be TenTails Jinchuurikis.",

He also is noted to have insanely high chakra reserves, much higher than Kakashi, in the very first arc. \n\nNaruto was never an underdog in terms of potential power, so when people get surprised that he actually is able to use that power later on in the series (which he worked hard to control, mind you) they somehow say something was contradicted?\n\nYou don\u2019t write a hard work > talent story when the MC is shown to have enormous gifts since the very beginning. \n\nI think the trouble people have is not understanding that hard work and natural gifts are NOT mutually exclusive. Lebron James works just as hard, if not harder than his peers, even though he was blessed physically.\n\nPeople also struggle to understand nuance. Naruto was weak IN BASE for the entire beginning of the series. And so he was a \u201cperceived\u201d underdog when not in use of the 9 tails chakra. Obviously as readers we know of his potential, from the times 9 tails slips out. Nearly all of Naruto\u2019s part 1 come with him using Kurama\n\nHaku? Check\n\nOrochimaru? Check\n\nKiba? Fart\n\nNeji? Check\n\nGaara? Check\n\nSasuke? Check.\n\nNaruto\u2019s main struggle was from a social aspect and learning to control the burden of the ninetails to TURN it into the gift that it always had the potential to be\n\nEdit: Naruto\u2019s base form was actively being hindered by the 9tails. As Kakshi states, Naruto\u2019s chakra would be 25x stronger if he hadn\u2019t been using a lot to keep the 9 tails held back. Lots of Naruto\u2019s early troubles and his \u201cfailure\u201d in base was due to this lack of chakra control caused by the 9tails. \n\nThis plot thread is addressed in shippuden, when Naruto realizes that HE needs to get stronger, and not rely on the ninetails, as it comes with great side affects. Many other characters, such as Orochimaru, state that Naruto is nothing without his tailed beast. That was the point being him learning the rasenshuriken, and him being adamant on taking Kakazu out on his own, in order to prove his own power to himself.",

This was also the only point where hashirama stopped being able to dominate the battlefield. \n\nSo Gai truly did become one of the strongest ninja to live simply by working the absolute hardest for the longest. Even 7 gates is a problem for most of the iconic characters in Naruto, considering that it makes Gai stronger than a lot of the jinchurikis. Gai is literally top 10 shinobi of all time, easily - and thats with 0 talent at all, just pure attitude/work ethic.",

What you could say it does push is, even if you have no talent, through extreme hard work, you could become a splendid shinobi.\nThe similarities between Lee\u2019s fight and Guys fight are I think purposeful.\n\nBoth pure hard worker, up against a natural gifted beast. Though they both LOSE, they prove that, through taijutsu alone and insane amounts of effort, they could become strong and splendid shinobi. I\u2019m sure all of us were proud of what they could accomplish, and didn\u2019t see them as losers just because they lost. They even both get crippled at the end (tho I wish Guy actually died (even tho I live him) because his sacrifice would\u2019ve meant more).",

Not everyone can be the best, but everyone can be the best version of themselves- and just by doing that you enter that top 5% of people, because regardless of your (lack of) endowments or talents, you\u2019ve got what no one else has - the actual drive and dedication to reach mastery. That beats even the people with the greatest of talents when talent doesnt work hard. And shit, did Lee get crippled too?! I don\u2019t remember that bit. \n\nI agree, maybe gai should have died but i am also happy that he\u2019s got to see the peacetime the war created. At least he wouldnt have died in vein like my boy Neji. They didnt have to do my boy Neji like that. \n\nBut overall i agree with your point. The way the plot goes makes it very hard to argue hard work > talent. I think the more important point is to actually realise our talents - because everyone is unique and that was something i liked about the naruto characters. They all had their quirks and they embraced their individuality. For example, shikamaru was the strategist, Choji liked to eat, Hinata was kind, Sakura could heal, Neji was wise, Lee had spirit etc.",

Madara's plan was so wildly ridiculous sometimes it was hard to suspend disbelief.\n\nReminds me of when he found Nagato, did a whole ass eye transplant, stole another set of Sharingan to use as replacenent eyes, then planned to use the Uchiha kid who's friend's death he somehow just set up to push him into using Nagato to revive him through Rinne Tensei.\n\nA lot of moving parts to say the least.",

It says so 100% in the databooks and those are written by Kishimoto.\n\nIf he would have gotten Hashirama cells from Kabuto, we would have seen either Kabuto or Sasuke listed as wood style users in the 4th databook character sheets or at least seen one of them use wood style/have crazy healing on screen or on panel.\n\nIt's just that Orochimaru's snake cells happen to be white like Hashi cells, hence the confusion. Kabuto probably did some flesh transfer like Jugo, since we know for sure he has Jugo's abilities.\n\nAnd also, I was under the impression for a while that the Rinnegan awakening might have been triggered when Hashirama gave Sasuke his chakra for a jutsu to bind Madara, before he gets stabbed by Madara. But no, that's not it either, because Hashirama was no longer an Ashura incarnation at that point, so he no longer has Ashura chakra.\n\nAnd i think that since Hagoromo gave Sasuke and Naruto a half of his Six Paths chakra each, that's why Sasuke only has one Rinnegan. If he would have gotten Ashura chakra he would have had both Rinnegan like Madara.",

So before he gets the arm) and I sadly couldn't find anything in the Last and Boruto Moviebooks or the Boruto databook on Naruto having the ability to use wood style, probably because those 3 books are pretty sparse in technical information, but he very obviously can use wood style, I don't think there can be any confusion about that if he has an arm of Hashi cells.\n\nAnd I don't think if they were a TenTails jinchuuriki they would be more monstrous than Madara was, since Madara already had Six Paths chakra before becoming TenTails jinchuuriki, just as they did. That they recieved it from Hagoromo doesn't make it more special. Six Paths chakra, either by mixing Indra and Ashura chakra or directly getting the end product from Hagoromo, is no different. And in Naruto's case, since he just recieved the ability to enter SP Sage Mode, becoming a TenTails jinchuuriki wouldn't grant him that anymore since he already has it. The best way to compare them is strip down the similar power-ups and compare them in base. Madara still ends up as the stronger TenTails Jinchuuriki of the 3, if all 3 were to be TenTails Jinchuurikis.",

He also is noted to have insanely high chakra reserves, much higher than Kakashi, in the very first arc. \n\nNaruto was never an underdog in terms of potential power, so when people get surprised that he actually is able to use that power later on in the series (which he worked hard to control, mind you) they somehow say something was contradicted?\n\nYou don\u2019t write a hard work > talent story when the MC is shown to have enormous gifts since the very beginning. \n\nI think the trouble people have is not understanding that hard work and natural gifts are NOT mutually exclusive. Lebron James works just as hard, if not harder than his peers, even though he was blessed physically.\n\nPeople also struggle to understand nuance. Naruto was weak IN BASE for the entire beginning of the series. And so he was a \u201cperceived\u201d underdog when not in use of the 9 tails chakra. Obviously as readers we know of his potential, from the times 9 tails slips out. Nearly all of Naruto\u2019s part 1 come with him using Kurama\n\nHaku? Check\n\nOrochimaru? Check\n\nKiba? Fart\n\nNeji? Check\n\nGaara? Check\n\nSasuke? Check.\n\nNaruto\u2019s main struggle was from a social aspect and learning to control the burden of the ninetails to TURN it into the gift that it always had the potential to be\n\nEdit: Naruto\u2019s base form was actively being hindered by the 9tails. As Kakshi states, Naruto\u2019s chakra would be 25x stronger if he hadn\u2019t been using a lot to keep the 9 tails held back. Lots of Naruto\u2019s early troubles and his \u201cfailure\u201d in base was due to this lack of chakra control caused by the 9tails. \n\nThis plot thread is addressed in shippuden, when Naruto realizes that HE needs to get stronger, and not rely on the ninetails, as it comes with great side affects. Many other characters, such as Orochimaru, state that Naruto is nothing without his tailed beast. That was the point being him learning the rasenshuriken, and him being adamant on taking Kakazu out on his own, in order to prove his own power to himself.",

Not everyone can be the best, but everyone can be the best version of themselves- and just by doing that you enter that top 5% of people, because regardless of your (lack of) endowments or talents, you\u2019ve got what no one else has - the actual drive and dedication to reach mastery. That beats even the people with the greatest of talents when talent doesnt work hard. And shit, did Lee get crippled too?! I don\u2019t remember that bit. \n\nI agree, maybe gai should have died but i am also happy that he\u2019s got to see the peacetime the war created. At least he wouldnt have died in vein like my boy Neji. They didnt have to do my boy Neji like that. \n\nBut overall i agree with your point. The way the plot goes makes it very hard to argue hard work > talent. I think the more important point is to actually realise our talents - because everyone is unique and that was something i liked about the naruto characters. They all had their quirks and they embraced their individuality. For example, shikamaru was the strategist, Choji liked to eat, Hinata was kind, Sakura could heal, Neji was wise, Lee had spirit etc.",

It says so 100% in the databooks and those are written by Kishimoto.\n\nIf he would have gotten Hashirama cells from Kabuto, we would have seen either Kabuto or Sasuke listed as wood style users in the 4th databook character sheets or at least seen one of them use wood style/have crazy healing on screen or on panel.\n\nIt's just that Orochimaru's snake cells happen to be white like Hashi cells, hence the confusion. Kabuto probably did some flesh transfer like Jugo, since we know for sure he has Jugo's abilities.\n\nAnd also, I was under the impression for a while that the Rinnegan awakening might have been triggered when Hashirama gave Sasuke his chakra for a jutsu to bind Madara, before he gets stabbed by Madara. But no, that's not it either, because Hashirama was no longer an Ashura incarnation at that point, so he no longer has Ashura chakra.\n\nAnd i think that since Hagoromo gave Sasuke and Naruto a half of his Six Paths chakra each, that's why Sasuke only has one Rinnegan. If he would have gotten Ashura chakra he would have had both Rinnegan like Madara.",

So before he gets the arm) and I sadly couldn't find anything in the Last and Boruto Moviebooks or the Boruto databook on Naruto having the ability to use wood style, probably because those 3 books are pretty sparse in technical information, but he very obviously can use wood style, I don't think there can be any confusion about that if he has an arm of Hashi cells.\n\nAnd I don't think if they were a TenTails jinchuuriki they would be more monstrous than Madara was, since Madara already had Six Paths chakra before becoming TenTails jinchuuriki, just as they did. That they recieved it from Hagoromo doesn't make it more special. Six Paths chakra, either by mixing Indra and Ashura chakra or directly getting the end product from Hagoromo, is no different. And in Naruto's case, since he just recieved the ability to enter SP Sage Mode, becoming a TenTails jinchuuriki wouldn't grant him that anymore since he already has it. The best way to compare them is strip down the similar power-ups and compare them in base. Madara still ends up as the stronger TenTails Jinchuuriki of the 3, if all 3 were to be TenTails Jinchuurikis.",

Not everyone can be the best, but everyone can be the best version of themselves- and just by doing that you enter that top 5% of people, because regardless of your (lack of) endowments or talents, you\u2019ve got what no one else has - the actual drive and dedication to reach mastery. That beats even the people with the greatest of talents when talent doesnt work hard. And shit, did Lee get crippled too?! I don\u2019t remember that bit. \n\nI agree, maybe gai should have died but i am also happy that he\u2019s got to see the peacetime the war created. At least he wouldnt have died in vein like my boy Neji. They didnt have to do my boy Neji like that. \n\nBut overall i agree with your point. The way the plot goes makes it very hard to argue hard work > talent. I think the more important point is to actually realise our talents - because everyone is unique and that was something i liked about the naruto characters. They all had their quirks and they embraced their individuality. For example, shikamaru was the strategist, Choji liked to eat, Hinata was kind, Sakura could heal, Neji was wise, Lee had spirit etc.",

It says so 100% in the databooks and those are written by Kishimoto.\n\nIf he would have gotten Hashirama cells from Kabuto, we would have seen either Kabuto or Sasuke listed as wood style users in the 4th databook character sheets or at least seen one of them use wood style/have crazy healing on screen or on panel.\n\nIt's just that Orochimaru's snake cells happen to be white like Hashi cells, hence the confusion. Kabuto probably did some flesh transfer like Jugo, since we know for sure he has Jugo's abilities.\n\nAnd also, I was under the impression for a while that the Rinnegan awakening might have been triggered when Hashirama gave Sasuke his chakra for a jutsu to bind Madara, before he gets stabbed by Madara. But no, that's not it either, because Hashirama was no longer an Ashura incarnation at that point, so he no longer has Ashura chakra.\n\nAnd i think that since Hagoromo gave Sasuke and Naruto a half of his Six Paths chakra each, that's why Sasuke only has one Rinnegan. If he would have gotten Ashura chakra he would have had both Rinnegan like Madara.",

So before he gets the arm) and I sadly couldn't find anything in the Last and Boruto Moviebooks or the Boruto databook on Naruto having the ability to use wood style, probably because those 3 books are pretty sparse in technical information, but he very obviously can use wood style, I don't think there can be any confusion about that if he has an arm of Hashi cells.\n\nAnd I don't think if they were a TenTails jinchuuriki they would be more monstrous than Madara was, since Madara already had Six Paths chakra before becoming TenTails jinchuuriki, just as they did. That they recieved it from Hagoromo doesn't make it more special. Six Paths chakra, either by mixing Indra and Ashura chakra or directly getting the end product from Hagoromo, is no different. And in Naruto's case, since he just recieved the ability to enter SP Sage Mode, becoming a TenTails jinchuuriki wouldn't grant him that anymore since he already has it. The best way to compare them is strip down the similar power-ups and compare them in base. Madara still ends up as the stronger TenTails Jinchuuriki of the 3, if all 3 were to be TenTails Jinchuurikis.",

So before he gets the arm) and I sadly couldn't find anything in the Last and Boruto Moviebooks or the Boruto databook on Naruto having the ability to use wood style, probably because those 3 books are pretty sparse in technical information, but he very obviously can use wood style, I don't think there can be any confusion about that if he has an arm of Hashi cells.\n\nAnd I don't think if they were a TenTails jinchuuriki they would be more monstrous than Madara was, since Madara already had Six Paths chakra before becoming TenTails jinchuuriki, just as they did. That they recieved it from Hagoromo doesn't make it more special. Six Paths chakra, either by mixing Indra and Ashura chakra or directly getting the end product from Hagoromo, is no different. And in Naruto's case, since he just recieved the ability to enter SP Sage Mode, becoming a TenTails jinchuuriki wouldn't grant him that anymore since he already has it. The best way to compare them is strip down the similar power-ups and compare them in base. Madara still ends up as the stronger TenTails Jinchuuriki of the 3, if all 3 were to be TenTails Jinchuurikis.",

He also doesn't use lava or boil or magnet release either, even when fighting a serious threat. Sadly, he still keeps to shadow clones and Rasengan.",

So before he gets the arm) and I sadly couldn't find anything in the Last and Boruto Moviebooks or the Boruto databook on Naruto having the ability to use wood style, probably because those 3 books are pretty sparse in technical information, but he very obviously can use wood style, I don't think there can be any confusion about that if he has an arm of Hashi cells.\n\nAnd I don't think if they were a TenTails jinchuuriki they would be more monstrous than Madara was, since Madara already had Six Paths chakra before becoming TenTails jinchuuriki, just as they did. That they recieved it from Hagoromo doesn't make it more special. Six Paths chakra, either by mixing Indra and Ashura chakra or directly getting the end product from Hagoromo, is no different. And in Naruto's case, since he just recieved the ability to enter SP Sage Mode, becoming a TenTails jinchuuriki wouldn't grant him that anymore since he already has it. The best way to compare them is strip down the similar power-ups and compare them in base. Madara still ends up as the stronger TenTails Jinchuuriki of the 3, if all 3 were to be TenTails Jinchuurikis.",
