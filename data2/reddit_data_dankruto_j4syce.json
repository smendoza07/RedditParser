I stopped watching the anime and read the manga exclusively because the fillers were so goddamn dumb and annoying. \n\nNo the show is still pretty big and dragged on.\n\nIt took like 10 years for this story to actually end lol. \n\nBut now that all of it is done, if you just watch the non-filler, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s relatively fast. Can probably binge it in a week if you watch A LOT or a month or 2 if you take your time",

But eventually it got to the point where the anime was way too close to the manga that if they just followed the manga, there wouldn\u2019t be any anime. They would run out of material \n\nSo the anime people had to make up filler episodes to delay until the manga could make more chapters and flesh the story out. \n\nPain arc was one of the best. \n\nHave you read the manga? I would read it so you know what\u2019s the \u201ctrue\u201d story and what\u2019s filler. It also gives you a better idea.",

I stopped watching the anime and read the manga exclusively because the fillers were so goddamn dumb and annoying. \n\nNo the show is still pretty big and dragged on.\n\nIt took like 10 years for this story to actually end lol. \n\nBut now that all of it is done, if you just watch the non-filler, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s relatively fast. Can probably binge it in a week if you watch A LOT or a month or 2 if you take your time",

But eventually it got to the point where the anime was way too close to the manga that if they just followed the manga, there wouldn\u2019t be any anime. They would run out of material \n\nSo the anime people had to make up filler episodes to delay until the manga could make more chapters and flesh the story out. \n\nPain arc was one of the best. \n\nHave you read the manga? I would read it so you know what\u2019s the \u201ctrue\u201d story and what\u2019s filler. It also gives you a better idea.",

I stopped watching the anime and read the manga exclusively because the fillers were so goddamn dumb and annoying. \n\nNo the show is still pretty big and dragged on.\n\nIt took like 10 years for this story to actually end lol. \n\nBut now that all of it is done, if you just watch the non-filler, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s relatively fast. Can probably binge it in a week if you watch A LOT or a month or 2 if you take your time",

But eventually it got to the point where the anime was way too close to the manga that if they just followed the manga, there wouldn\u2019t be any anime. They would run out of material \n\nSo the anime people had to make up filler episodes to delay until the manga could make more chapters and flesh the story out. \n\nPain arc was one of the best. \n\nHave you read the manga? I would read it so you know what\u2019s the \u201ctrue\u201d story and what\u2019s filler. It also gives you a better idea.",
