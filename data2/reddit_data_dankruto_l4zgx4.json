You get karma from:\n\nA) your posts getting upvotes\n\nB) your comments getting upvotes\n\nC) Awarding people\n\nD) getting awarded.\n\nHow much you get for each of them is a mystery that nobody knows the true answer of. You are able to see how much karma you have total, or just see how much you have in each of those 4 categories. Mobile only shows the first two, though...\n\nYou lose karma when somebody downvoted you. Again, how much is lost and how it\u2019s calculated is unknown.\n\nSo when you press on OP\u2019s name, you can see they have high post karma, but low comment karma, meaning that if they were to get that many downvoted, while their overall karma wouldn\u2019t be disturbed too much, their comment karma would probably go into the negatives.\n\nI hope I helped.",

Then they changed Reddit\u2019s upvote algorithm so that posts displayed a more accurate upvote total, and this boosted everyone karma at the time. This also changed the algoritm again. Before this posts sort of soft capped at around 10k upvotes. After the update, posts with around 10K upvotes maybe jumped to 45K, or 70K. \n\nNow they\u2019ve added the awarder and awardee karmas and I don\u2019t know anything about those besides different awards give different karma. \n\nSo yeah, karma is a complicated equation that has had way too much thought put into it.",

You are able to see how much karma you have total, or just see how much you have in each of those 4 categories. Mobile only shows the first two, though...\n\nYou lose karma when somebody downvoted you. Again, how much is lost and how it\u2019s calculated is unknown.\n\nSo when you press on OP\u2019s name, you can see they have high post karma, but low comment karma, meaning that if they were to get that many downvoted, while their overall karma wouldn\u2019t be disturbed too much, their comment karma would probably go into the negatives.\n\nI hope I helped.",

Then they changed it so it was an algorithm that gave diminishing returns on karma per number of upvotes on a single post. Then they split comment and post karma. Then they changed Reddit\u2019s upvote algorithm so that posts displayed a more accurate upvote total, and this boosted everyone karma at the time. This also changed the algoritm again. Before this posts sort of soft capped at around 10k upvotes. After the update, posts with around 10K upvotes maybe jumped to 45K, or 70K. \n\nNow they\u2019ve added the awarder and awardee karmas and I don\u2019t know anything about those besides different awards give different karma. \n\nSo yeah, karma is a complicated equation that has had way too much thought put into it.",

You are able to see how much karma you have total, or just see how much you have in each of those 4 categories. Mobile only shows the first two, though...\n\nYou lose karma when somebody downvoted you. Again, how much is lost and how it\u2019s calculated is unknown.\n\nSo when you press on OP\u2019s name, you can see they have high post karma, but low comment karma, meaning that if they were to get that many downvoted, while their overall karma wouldn\u2019t be disturbed too much, their comment karma would probably go into the negatives.\n\nI hope I helped.",

Then they changed it so it was an algorithm that gave diminishing returns on karma per number of upvotes on a single post. Then they split comment and post karma. Then they changed Reddit\u2019s upvote algorithm so that posts displayed a more accurate upvote total, and this boosted everyone karma at the time. This also changed the algoritm again. Before this posts sort of soft capped at around 10k upvotes. After the update, posts with around 10K upvotes maybe jumped to 45K, or 70K. \n\nNow they\u2019ve added the awarder and awardee karmas and I don\u2019t know anything about those besides different awards give different karma. \n\nSo yeah, karma is a complicated equation that has had way too much thought put into it.",
