It'd work better for someone with a less longish skull and a lower forehead. On the right, he looks to me like someone you'd see in a 2000's Black Eyed Peas video. It's admittedly not necessarily an aesthetic I'm, personally, particularly into, but it just combines better into a consistent overall style with the glasses and ear rings.",
