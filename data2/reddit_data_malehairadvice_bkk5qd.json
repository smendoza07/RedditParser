Remember that a good barber/stylist can customize any look you are drawn to and make it work for you and your head shape so don't worry too much about \"would it work for me\". The key here is not going to a chain chop shop and getting butchered by a first-year beauty school nearly drop out. Find a pro barber or stylist who can take good care of you. My preference is a good barber as they will know men's hair best.",

The only detail is that I have it shorter on the top back than on the top front because I have a lot of hair and it would look bad if it was equally long on top, but this is something my barber noticed when I asked her the haircut.\n\nAlso, I use a bit of wax in the mornings to keep my hair up and just a tiny bit messy on the top. This is probably the most important part because I used to have a hairstyle similar to this when I was younger but without wax my hair would go downwards and looked way worse",

The only detail is that I have it shorter on the top back than on the top front because I have a lot of hair and it would look bad if it was equally long on top, but this is something my barber noticed when I asked her the haircut.\n\nAlso, I use a bit of wax in the mornings to keep my hair up and just a tiny bit messy on the top. This is probably the most important part because I used to have a hairstyle similar to this when I was younger but without wax my hair would go downwards and looked way worse",
