    "body": "Next time I see some wannabe SD on here moaning about how it\u2019s so hard to find a SB, I\u2019m gonna tell him to do a profile review \ud83d\ude02\n\nHey Handsome!\n* make sure to smile more in your pics. Ideally with teeth. We want to see how theyre holding up. Make sure to look appealing to us, even if it makes you uncomfortable!\n* A fitted polo gives us a good sense of your physique. \n* Grey sweatpants are your version of a bikini pic \ud83d\ude09 just like you want to see the shape of our body in great details, we want to see your ...ahem... shape, too!\n* We\u2019ll need to see at least one pic of you at a luxury venue, or inside of a luxury automobile. If you drive a Corolla and like casual dining, know that your chances for success will be very low. I mean, is it even fair of us to suggest you keep trying to find a SB if you don\u2019t have the means? \n* make sure to show your full face. We don\u2019t want to waste our time on an uggo. Be prepared to immediately video verify at my behest, if any part of your face is concealed or blurred. I\u2019ve been having great M&G since I started this video thing during the pandemic! \n* no hatfishing, fatfishing, or using pics from 2002; we don\u2019t want to shudder when we see you step out of your Mercedes. \n* Just be real. But if you\u2019re not naturally flawless make sure to employ undetectable hair plugs, laser therapy, Botox, a little lift even, maybe manjectjons etc. Nothing wrong with getting your youth back a little bit, right? Work on yourself, is what I mean.\n* use that About Me section to set yourself apart from the other SD. And don\u2019t say \u201cI\u201d too much. It\u2019s called the About Me section, but it\u2019s really about impressing us. We don\u2019t want a SD who\u2019s obsessed with himself.\n* use the Seeking section to make your intentions clear.  If we don\u2019t see a blatantly obvious euphemism for \u201cI will *definitely* give you lots of money\u201d then it\u2019s an instant next! \n* if we see the FWB or the \u201ctravel with me\u201d tags, we assume you\u2019re a John, or a Salt Daddy, and it will be an instant next. \n* remember: \u201cI don\u2019t want it to feel transactional\u201d or \u201cyou should be interested in more than my wallet\u201d is an big red flag!! Ugh. They must be hyping that phrase up on wtv the SD version of TikTok is \ud83d\ude44\n* multiple locations makes me think you\u2019re a businessman who travels a lot and is looking for an escort. Orange flag for sure!!\n* be yourself, but don\u2019t say or do things that show us your real age like wearing sweater vests or posting scans of grainy film photos of you when you were a hot army guy in 1986. \n* don\u2019t talk too much, or have too many opinions, really. It\u2019s boring if it\u2019s all about you.\n* be sure never to poop, burp, fart, etc. don\u2019t be gross like that...we don\u2019t care that you\u2019re human!\n\n\nLadies, have I missed anything? \nChime in via comment!",

Or don't blame us in ghosting, if we won't recognize you at M&G or run away:) \n\nPlease, also note, that picture of your right eye is not enough to seduce us). The same applies for pictures with a huge smile emoji instead of your head.... \ud83d\ude09\n\nWe use your income numbers to understand, if you may pay our desired allowance or not (since you are probably going to be offended & faint, if we will try to discuss it prior M&G/in a first 5 messages... So, we need to guess somehow).... That means, please, don't show more than you have: you will attract those of us, who what more than you can afford.... And don't show much less (unless it reflects that you still can pay the good allowance) : we will never reply your messages, if will think that you can't afford us.... \n\nAnd, please, if you don't want to be \"transactional\" or to \"pay for having a girlfiend/lover/dating\", dont register your profile on SA... Never ever.. :)).\n\nP. S. : BONUS TIPS:\n\nHow to describe your body type properly (and yes, that's extra important.. Some of us can't go for certain types no matter what):\n\nSlim: aka body of a slim teenager. Ectomorph. No fat,  no abs. Just slim. No fat/belly (even the small one). \n\nAthletic: mmmmm, you have abs on your torso. Niiiice.... \ud83d\ude0b No fat/belly. :)\n\nAverage: you don't have abs, not slim(see above). But you DON'T have a belly either (this will be in a next category, wait). Just a normal body, with a small extra skin overlapping you belted waistline by side( when in pants).\n\nA few extra pounds: do you have a small belly fat? Here you are!!! Everything is considered to be an \"extra pound\", if it brings you even the smallest belly.\n \nFull/overweight: your belly is not that small already.... Or not just belly... Same, if you consider yourself just as \"having large bones\".\n\nObese: you are more that the previous category.",

We met once a week or less. We didn\u2019t text except to arrange date nights. \n\nNB, though, that I do see a correlation between a man who has the means, but more importantly  the personality type!! to treat himself to some indulgences... and a man who has the means to afford sugar, and isn\u2019t going to be tight fisted. \n\nMy first Daddy with the beat up Volvo?

It looks like a $20-25k car unless you see the \"electric\" badge on the back and even then people probably assume it's cheap. I love it and it's awesome not having to stop for gas, drive on HOV lanes, zero emissions, etc ..\n\nIf a POT doesn't want to be with me for driving what she thinks is a cheap or modest car, I'm glad to think of it as a screening tool. \ud83e\udd23",

You just have to be willing to put in the work to separate the chaff from the wheat and to be up front about what you are looking for and what you have to offer.\n\nGuys that bitch about how hard it is to find a SB are either waiting for women to contact them first or are only screening one girl at a time.  I go into searching expecting that half the women I contact will be scammers and half of the others wont be compatible.  Had I only been contacting one person at a time it would have taken months to find my current SB.",
