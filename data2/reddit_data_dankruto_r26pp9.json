All of a suddenly, Jigen would just have a sword through his chest. No time to react whatsoever.

And if you notice both sasuke and naruto lost power after that ark although they are stronger now. Naruto lost his truth seeking balls and sasuke had less chakra but still way more than his ems. So sasuke was nerfed yes I also find it a little bit annoying but it was all well accounted for as the Teleportation jutsu as only been freely used by the ototsuki clan who have seemingly unlimited chakra but lack fighting ability which lead to their defeats",

Before that they were all leftover chakra after he had fought Madara (for a little bit) and then Kaguya.\n\nWhich i imagine would've required him a shit ton of chakra because he was basically spamming dem new Rinnegan abilities he just received from his sugar daddy.\n\n\nWell, it could've also been the case of Hagoromo not only refilling Naruto and Sasuke's chakra, but also temporarily pushed their max chakra limit way higher than normal (at least until their last fight) but that's a headcannon from me. So idk...\n\nI don't care if Naruto and Sasuke are indeed nerfed, it is Boruto's show after all. But i, and everyone else want good writing to go with it. \n\nWant to nerf those two to make way for Boruto? Sure. But don't do it in a braindead way, making both of Naruto and Sasuke look like idiots. At least Naruto had some kind of redemption with Baryon mode but they kinda did Sasuke dirty smh.\n\n\nBut there's probably a lot of things i might missed or get wrong. So if there's any, just let me know.",

Both are bad writing, but one is worse than the other. Personally, I liked Momoshiki vs Naruto & Sasuke, and I believe it is better than Ishiki vs baryon mode.",

If it is real that he can see spirits using the rinnegan, then the key word would be **see**, not **sense**. \n\nHe can't sense his Chakra signature and rinnegan doesn't give him 360 vision, so he got hit by a sneak attack. \n\n>Sharingan is able to see nanites..

Sasuke was the one who kicked that otsusuki so hard he had to eat his partner. He was the one of 2, who even though was nerfed and exausted kicked his fused a$$. \n\nIt's Fused Momoshiki who gave karma to Boruto, he's stronger, if that wasn't the case then he would've had a harder time against Boro, since base momo was shown having a hard time against 2 Kages. \n\n>Unless you are saying borushiki is stronger than momoshiki himself (which isn't btw).. Your point is irrelevant\n\nWhy would he need to be stronger to take out a really soft eye?? My point in there was that an amplified strength from the horns is enough to actually take out Sasuke's eye in a sneak attack.\n\nEven Isshiki lost to Kaguya when he got shanked from the back.\n\nJust because 1 is stronger than 2, and 2 is stronger than 3, doesn't mean that whatever the situation is, 1 would always remain victorious against 3.\n\nSasuke getting tired after being badly injured by Isshiki, him worrying about Baryon Mode, Momoshiki being amplified by the horns, and Sasuke being caught off guard are advantages, they are all variables that made Sasuke lose that one soft eye.\n\nThe author is showing that Momoshiki is learning on how to be a ninja by watching how Boruto and everyone else fights, he's trying to show, not tell.",

I still love Naruto but their power/chakra levels are almost 100% dependent on what the plot needs them to be. I mean hell, when Sasuke is learning Chidori, Kakashi explicitly states that he has a two shot limit. That implies that using Chidori twice uses over 2/3 of his chakra. When he fights Gaara he uses it _three_ times, in addition to Sharingan and all of the jutsu he uses when chasing and fighting Temari.",

He can teleport you right into his attacks for an easy takedown. Like, he could've done the teleport thing to Jigen and there would have been no avoiding it. All of a suddenly, Jigen would just have a sword through his chest. No time to react whatsoever. Or he has Naruto attack him and switches places with Jigen at the last moment.\n\nHis moves are just \"instakill\" even if you're faster than him. Obviously, Sasuke can't be doing stuff like he did in the War Arc or it'd be too easy. :D Hell, he could have just switched places with Isshiki when the cubes were coming down on them. He could have made Boruto and Jigen switch places instead of merely switching places with Boruto.",

And if you notice both sasuke and naruto lost power after that ark although they are stronger now. Naruto lost his truth seeking balls and sasuke had less chakra but still way more than his ems. So sasuke was nerfed yes I also find it a little bit annoying but it was all well accounted for as the Teleportation jutsu as only been freely used by the ototsuki clan who have seemingly unlimited chakra but lack fighting ability which lead to their defeats",

Before that they were all leftover chakra after he had fought Madara (for a little bit) and then Kaguya.\n\nWhich i imagine would've required him a shit ton of chakra because he was basically spamming dem new Rinnegan abilities he just received from his sugar daddy.\n\n\nWell, it could've also been the case of Hagoromo not only refilling Naruto and Sasuke's chakra, but also temporarily pushed their max chakra limit way higher than normal (at least until their last fight) but that's a headcannon from me. So idk...\n\nI don't care if Naruto and Sasuke are indeed nerfed, it is Boruto's show after all. But i, and everyone else want good writing to go with it. \n\nWant to nerf those two to make way for Boruto? Sure. But don't do it in a braindead way, making both of Naruto and Sasuke look like idiots. At least Naruto had some kind of redemption with Baryon mode but they kinda did Sasuke dirty smh.\n\n\nBut there's probably a lot of things i might missed or get wrong.

Kaguya could've been afraid of the whole clan. \n\nAlso, Quantity =/= Quality, it's not connected at all and unless it's shown that Momoshiki's fruits gave him a stronger power boost than Kaguya, everything about it is just assumptions. \n\n>Momoshiki did it.. And by the way he said, the planet had same number of people on earth and was as large or larger than earth , and he was obviously born as a higher class too\n\nDid he say this at the novels? Or maybe at the manga but I just forgot? Can you pls provide a link so I can see?",

Forgot what the ckarka point thingy is called)\n\nMomoshiki has stronger summons than Sasuke's susanoo\n\nMomoshiki can absorb jutsus and blast them even stronger, so that counters Sasuke's ninjutsu.\n\nMomoshiki wins against Sasuke tbh, unless it's before Kaguya and he has the seal and also the help from Naruto.\n\nIt wouldn't even be hard to seal Momoshiki due to him being weaker than Kaguya.",

How would he see the soul when he hasn't even yanked it out of his body yet? And why does it even matter? If it is real that he can see spirits using the rinnegan, then the key word would be **see**, not **sense**. \n\nHe can't sense his Chakra signature and rinnegan doesn't give him 360 vision, so he got hit by a sneak attack. \n\n>Sharingan is able to see nanites.. Is a 14 year old kid smaller than Nanites?\n\nDoesn't matter, if you don't have a 360 vision then you're susceptible to a sneak attack. \n\n>Well guess what? Sasuke was the one who kicked that otsusuki so hard he had to eat his partner. He was the one of 2, who even though was nerfed and exausted kicked his fused a$$. \n\nIt's Fused Momoshiki who gave karma to Boruto, he's stronger, if that wasn't the case then he would've had a harder time against Boro, since base momo was shown having a hard time against 2 Kages. \n\n>Unless you are saying borushiki is stronger than momoshiki himself (which isn't btw).. Your point is irrelevant\n\nWhy would he need to be stronger to take out a really soft eye?? My point in there was that an amplified strength from the horns is enough to actually take out Sasuke's eye in a sneak attack.\n\nEven Isshiki lost to Kaguya when he got shanked from the back.\n\nJust because 1 is stronger than 2, and 2 is stronger than 3, doesn't mean that whatever the situation is, 1 would always remain victorious against 3.\n\nSasuke getting tired after being badly injured by Isshiki, him worrying about Baryon Mode, Momoshiki being amplified by the horns, and Sasuke being caught off guard are advantages, they are all variables that made Sasuke lose that one soft eye.\n\nThe author is showing that Momoshiki is learning on how to be a ninja by watching how Boruto and everyone else fights, he's trying to show, not tell.",

Before that they were all leftover chakra after he had fought Madara (for a little bit) and then Kaguya.\n\nWhich i imagine would've required him a shit ton of chakra because he was basically spamming dem new Rinnegan abilities he just received from his sugar daddy.\n\n\nWell, it could've also been the case of Hagoromo not only refilling Naruto and Sasuke's chakra, but also temporarily pushed their max chakra limit way higher than normal (at least until their last fight) but that's a headcannon from me. So idk...\n\nI don't care if Naruto and Sasuke are indeed nerfed, it is Boruto's show after all. But i, and everyone else want good writing to go with it. \n\nWant to nerf those two to make way for Boruto? Sure. But don't do it in a braindead way, making both of Naruto and Sasuke look like idiots. At least Naruto had some kind of redemption with Baryon mode but they kinda did Sasuke dirty smh.\n\n\nBut there's probably a lot of things i might missed or get wrong.

Kaguya could've been afraid of the whole clan. \n\nAlso, Quantity =/= Quality, it's not connected at all and unless it's shown that Momoshiki's fruits gave him a stronger power boost than Kaguya, everything about it is just assumptions. \n\n>Momoshiki did it.. And by the way he said, the planet had same number of people on earth and was as large or larger than earth , and he was obviously born as a higher class too\n\nDid he say this at the novels? Or maybe at the manga but I just forgot? Can you pls provide a link so I can see?",

My point in there was that an amplified strength from the horns is enough to actually take out Sasuke's eye in a sneak attack.\n\nEven Isshiki lost to Kaguya when he got shanked from the back.\n\nJust because 1 is stronger than 2, and 2 is stronger than 3, doesn't mean that whatever the situation is, 1 would always remain victorious against 3.\n\nSasuke getting tired after being badly injured by Isshiki, him worrying about Baryon Mode, Momoshiki being amplified by the horns, and Sasuke being caught off guard are advantages, they are all variables that made Sasuke lose that one soft eye.\n\nThe author is showing that Momoshiki is learning on how to be a ninja by watching how Boruto and everyone else fights, he's trying to show, not tell.",

Kaguya could've been afraid of the whole clan. \n\nAlso, Quantity =/= Quality, it's not connected at all and unless it's shown that Momoshiki's fruits gave him a stronger power boost than Kaguya, everything about it is just assumptions. \n\n>Momoshiki did it.. And by the way he said, the planet had same number of people on earth and was as large or larger than earth , and he was obviously born as a higher class too\n\nDid he say this at the novels? Or maybe at the manga but I just forgot? Can you pls provide a link so I can see?",

It's shown to be able to overwhelm Kurama avatar which is shown to be as strong or stronger than susanoo, Momoshiki can also just absorb the Chakra coming from the susanoo when he absorbs them from the bijuus. \n\nMomoshiki is stronger in hand to hand due to the Byakugan tenketsu(is that it? Forgot what the ckarka point thingy is called)\n\nMomoshiki has stronger summons than Sasuke's susanoo\n\nMomoshiki can absorb jutsus and blast them even stronger, so that counters Sasuke's ninjutsu.\n\nMomoshiki wins against Sasuke tbh, unless it's before Kaguya and he has the seal and also the help from Naruto.\n\nIt wouldn't even be hard to seal Momoshiki due to him being weaker than Kaguya.",

Statements from the novels only counts when they have feats to show it, since you might blow it out of proportion like: \"Kinshiki shattered the earth beneath him with his axe\" \"OMG IT MEANS HE'S PLANET BUSTER OMG OMG\"",

How would he see the soul when he hasn't even yanked it out of his body yet? And why does it even matter? If it is real that he can see spirits using the rinnegan, then the key word would be **see**, not **sense**. \n\nHe can't sense his Chakra signature and rinnegan doesn't give him 360 vision, so he got hit by a sneak attack. \n\n>Sharingan is able to see nanites.. Is a 14 year old kid smaller than Nanites?\n\nDoesn't matter, if you don't have a 360 vision then you're susceptible to a sneak attack. \n\n>Well guess what? Sasuke was the one who kicked that otsusuki so hard he had to eat his partner. He was the one of 2, who even though was nerfed and exausted kicked his fused a$$. \n\nIt's Fused Momoshiki who gave karma to Boruto, he's stronger, if that wasn't the case then he would've had a harder time against Boro, since base momo was shown having a hard time against 2 Kages. \n\n>Unless you are saying borushiki is stronger than momoshiki himself (which isn't btw).. Your point is irrelevant\n\nWhy would he need to be stronger to take out a really soft eye?? My point in there was that an amplified strength from the horns is enough to actually take out Sasuke's eye in a sneak attack.\n\nEven Isshiki lost to Kaguya when he got shanked from the back.\n\nJust because 1 is stronger than 2, and 2 is stronger than 3, doesn't mean that whatever the situation is, 1 would always remain victorious against 3.\n\nSasuke getting tired after being badly injured by Isshiki, him worrying about Baryon Mode, Momoshiki being amplified by the horns, and Sasuke being caught off guard are advantages, they are all variables that made Sasuke lose that one soft eye.\n\nThe author is showing that Momoshiki is learning on how to be a ninja by watching how Boruto and everyone else fights, he's trying to show, not tell.",

Kaguya could've been afraid of the whole clan. \n\nAlso, Quantity =/= Quality, it's not connected at all and unless it's shown that Momoshiki's fruits gave him a stronger power boost than Kaguya, everything about it is just assumptions. \n\n>Momoshiki did it.. And by the way he said, the planet had same number of people on earth and was as large or larger than earth , and he was obviously born as a higher class too\n\nDid he say this at the novels? Or maybe at the manga but I just forgot? Can you pls provide a link so I can see?",

You have a limit on what derogatory terms to say. How come you feel it is ok to call people a different slur? It doesn't matter if they are mentally disabled or not, it is still a slur. You won't say the n word because you know it is bad. Even if I wasn't black, you still wouldn't say it to me either. \n\n It proves you feel that other people are inferior by you calling them the r word.

Both are bad writing, but one is worse than the other. Personally, I liked Momoshiki vs Naruto & Sasuke, and I believe it is better than Ishiki vs baryon mode.",

Kaguya could've been afraid of the whole clan. \n\nAlso, Quantity =/= Quality, it's not connected at all and unless it's shown that Momoshiki's fruits gave him a stronger power boost than Kaguya, everything about it is just assumptions. \n\n>Momoshiki did it.. And by the way he said, the planet had same number of people on earth and was as large or larger than earth , and he was obviously born as a higher class too\n\nDid he say this at the novels? Or maybe at the manga but I just forgot? Can you pls provide a link so I can see?",
