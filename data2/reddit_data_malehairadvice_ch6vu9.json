Currently looks really good in the photo, but it never stays like this and I end up with really uneven hair due to the wind. I need a mirror to restyle and that's annoying. I'd say it's quite thin hair, and I do have quite a high hairline on the sides which I try and hide with my longer hair. Don't shampoo all the time, usually just oil and/or sea salt spray, blow dry and a little baxters clay. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny help appreciated, thanks guys!",

I use the sea salt first thing when I wake up and then wear a hair band to help train the hair to stay back. Once that dries I apply some clay with my hands and style with my fingers. If I have some important meeting or something I will hit it with a boar hair brush. I really like bad rabbit clay (I got it off amazon). It holds really well especially after a day or two without shampooing at night. I also still need a mirror throughout the day, but instead I just set my phone against my monitor and check it using the camera. You might not have a desk job like me though.",

I use the sea salt first thing when I wake up and then wear a hair band to help train the hair to stay back. Once that dries I apply some clay with my hands and style with my fingers. If I have some important meeting or something I will hit it with a boar hair brush. I really like bad rabbit clay (I got it off amazon). It holds really well especially after a day or two without shampooing at night. I also still need a mirror throughout the day, but instead I just set my phone against my monitor and check it using the camera. You might not have a desk job like me though.",
