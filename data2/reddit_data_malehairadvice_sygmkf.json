So yeah, 4.\n\nI really doubt you have a round face at all. Picture 1 has a short beard and we can clearly see your whole face shape and it's definitely not round but actually nicely chiseled and masculine.\n\nI don't personally think that long beards are handsome because they hide whatever facial feature is underneath. If you have poor features then I understand a long beard but if you have a sharp jaw like yours there is no reason to hide it. Hiding it with a long beard only brings attention to the fact that you maybe don't have a strong jaw or that you think that you don't have one. Beards very quickly become a hiding place. \n\nThat being said hair 4 with beard 1.\n\nEdit: out of curiousity what hair product are you using in picture 4?",
