I don\u2019t care how much money you spend on me, if you don\u2019t understand why I won\u2019t raw dog you the first time we have a sexual encounter take your money and shove it. If I am okay doing that with one person, why should you believe I would not be okay doing that with anyone? This logic applies not only to me but him as well! Clearly a repeat offender... not a risk I\u2019m willing to take.",

She\u2019s saying the idea that \u201can STD test\u201d completely mitigates all risk is laughable.  You yourself agree that it is increasing your risk to have unprotected sex.. if you\u2019re engaging in risky behavior you\u2019re literally acting less responsibly.  \n\nI have no problem with a guy who owns that his behavior is risky as fuck, he could catch an STD at any moment, yet still prefers to go raw.  The problem is with the attempted \u201cnegotiation\u201d and convincing these guys do.  They try to minimize concerns... but the concerns are very valid! \n\nI would absolutely and have laughed in someone\u2019s face who attempted to tell me they were STD free and snipped in attempts to have unprotected sex with me.  I\u2019m not shaming them for their desires I\u2019m laughing at how illogical their responses are.  \n\nSo go ahead... if you want to propose no condom sex to me (which will always get a no) I will not shame your desire for the experience of raw sex... but if you start to  insinuate my concerns are irrelevant, or that it\u2019s perfectly safe and fine.... I will totally judge that.  99% of the men in the bowl who want raw sex would never stop to ask a SB for an STD test.  If (and that\u2019s a big if) they don\u2019t have an STD yet, it\u2019s only a matter of time. ",

And the same goes for me. How does he know how many people I\u2019m actually sleeping with?! \n\n\nEdit: I was in a LT SR for 3 years and we used condoms every time! He has no issues, so it is possible. Our sex was very enjoyable and we had a blast!! ",

You shame people for their honest views and yet your stance is built on a hypocritical and unhealthy view of exclusivity (since you are a married man sleeping with someone other than your wife). \n\nAnd yes, my SD is married.  He does not have another SB and I am not seeing anyone else but it is absolutely an open relationship as he has no intention to leave his wife.  He has even asked me about my love life outside of the SR.  He is in his 50s so he\u2019s by no means a millennial or new aged... he\u2019s just realistic!  Not having exclusivity does not always equate to a cock carousel.  And even if it did for someone, you really have no room to judge!  Perhaps if you had been more sexually liberated and honest about your sexual desires earlier in life you would not have ended up legally bound to a significant other that you felt like you needed to secretly step out on for sexual satisfaction.  \n\nThere is no need to shame women and men who are simply being realistic about this lifestyle.  That is why you are often downvoted \u2014 because you\u2019re not adding any value by degrading the entire community you\u2019re participating in.  You should be thankful for the SBs that don\u2019t demand exclusivity because despite what you tell yourself, what you are offering is not an exclusive relationship. ",

Literally my point is that marriage is messy, muddy, life changes and people go through their own phases.  If you think that there is certainty of no future sex with your wife (unless there is medical condition preventing) then you are making a really ignorant assumption. I\u2019m not saying the sex will be often or good, but it\u2019s EXTREMELY possible for sex to happen in marriages that have experienced dry spells.  Often in life there are moments and influences that can influence people to try to spice back up their marriage... my example was something that could strike a chord either a steamy book or tv show, or a friend talking about their own divorce and it scaring them into making more of an effort, or perhaps them being worried about the husband having an affair.  I\u2019m also not stupid and have many friends who are in dead bedroom marriages, grew up with tons of friends whose parents had dead bedrooms and eventually led to divorce.  It\u2019s not black and white, it\u2019s messy and fluid.  \n\nIn many dead bedroom marriages a friendship and emotional companionship is still absolutely prevalent (aka why men want to cheat and don\u2019t have plans to leave their wives). My point is a single person doesn\u2019t have that freedom.  Let\u2019s say you see your SB 4 times a month and the rest of the month you\u2019re sharing dinners, conversation, life events with your SO.  It doesn\u2019t matter that you\u2019re not fucking your SO, your SB is (in the exclusive scenario) having to experience her downtime alone.\n\nAnd as a female that has been with married men in dead bedroom relationships I can PROMISE you things can absolutely change for various reasons... in which case why would a SB expect a SD to tell her \u201coh by the way my wife must have had an extra glass of wine last night and made the moves on me\u201d.  He\u2019s probably not going to, because he writes it off as okay in his mind (just as he writes off his SB).   And if he does tell her... what are we supposed to just sit around and say \u201cok maybe it was just one time\u201d.... \ud83d\ude44\n\nAnd a SB is not free to find a boyfriend in an exclusive relationship.  That\u2019s literally the point of the exclusivity... sex is a part of adult relationships so how would she be free to find a boyfriend ????? This is the year 2018... actively going on dates and getting to know people (usually people are \u201cseeing each other\u201d casually for a month+ before boyfriend title) usually involves sex. I personally don\u2019t have the time or desire to dip my feet in both ponds right now but I\u2019m still aware that it\u2019s a lose lose situation for a SB to be in an \u201cexclusive\u201d relationship with a married man.  She has zero control over what happens between he and his wife (or whether he is honest) and zero ability to even at all dip her toes into casual dating without ending the SR.  It\u2019s a double standard and it\u2019s just not fair or realistic.  \n",

I've been surprised over the number of seemingly intelligent, understanding and caring men (vanilla included) who bitched about condoms. I went home crying one night over someone (former coworker) I thought would be different. I don't cry anymore. The majority of men are instinct based and animalistic that's just the harsh reality. But at the same time which gender has any more morals than the other? Men objectify women for physical pleasure and women objectify men for emotional and financial support. I met with a man who was going to put it in raw if I hadn't asked him to put condoms on (he brought condoms mildly redeeming). Then he asked if I'd consider raw if we got tested. I said no (hell no inside my head) I knew it wouldn't last long based on his needs but we had a fun few dates. I knew he'd find someone else who would go bare. Which was kind of crazy to me based on his profession that he'd be so reckless (also he is married). But that's men. Sagami condoms feel amazing. In my one and only experience with them they slid a bit which was concerning but they stayed on. Saw a couple reviews that had the same experience but most had no problems.",

She\u2019s saying the idea that \u201can STD test\u201d completely mitigates all risk is laughable.  You yourself agree that it is increasing your risk to have unprotected sex.. if you\u2019re engaging in risky behavior you\u2019re literally acting less responsibly.  \n\nI have no problem with a guy who owns that his behavior is risky as fuck, he could catch an STD at any moment, yet still prefers to go raw.  The problem is with the attempted \u201cnegotiation\u201d and convincing these guys do.  They try to minimize concerns... but the concerns are very valid! \n\nI would absolutely and have laughed in someone\u2019s face who attempted to tell me they were STD free and snipped in attempts to have unprotected sex with me.  I\u2019m not shaming them for their desires I\u2019m laughing at how illogical their responses are.  \n\nSo go ahead... if you want to propose no condom sex to me (which will always get a no) I will not shame your desire for the experience of raw sex... but if you start to  insinuate my concerns are irrelevant, or that it\u2019s perfectly safe and fine.... I will totally judge that.  99% of the men in the bowl who want raw sex would never stop to ask a SB for an STD test.  If (and that\u2019s a big if) they don\u2019t have an STD yet, it\u2019s only a matter of time. ",

You shame people for their honest views and yet your stance is built on a hypocritical and unhealthy view of exclusivity (since you are a married man sleeping with someone other than your wife). \n\nAnd yes, my SD is married.  He does not have another SB and I am not seeing anyone else but it is absolutely an open relationship as he has no intention to leave his wife.  He has even asked me about my love life outside of the SR.  He is in his 50s so he\u2019s by no means a millennial or new aged... he\u2019s just realistic!  Not having exclusivity does not always equate to a cock carousel.  And even if it did for someone, you really have no room to judge!  Perhaps if you had been more sexually liberated and honest about your sexual desires earlier in life you would not have ended up legally bound to a significant other that you felt like you needed to secretly step out on for sexual satisfaction.  \n\nThere is no need to shame women and men who are simply being realistic about this lifestyle.  That is why you are often downvoted \u2014 because you\u2019re not adding any value by degrading the entire community you\u2019re participating in.  You should be thankful for the SBs that don\u2019t demand exclusivity because despite what you tell yourself, what you are offering is not an exclusive relationship. ",

Literally my point is that marriage is messy, muddy, life changes and people go through their own phases.  If you think that there is certainty of no future sex with your wife (unless there is medical condition preventing) then you are making a really ignorant assumption. I\u2019m not saying the sex will be often or good, but it\u2019s EXTREMELY possible for sex to happen in marriages that have experienced dry spells.  Often in life there are moments and influences that can influence people to try to spice back up their marriage... my example was something that could strike a chord either a steamy book or tv show, or a friend talking about their own divorce and it scaring them into making more of an effort, or perhaps them being worried about the husband having an affair.  I\u2019m also not stupid and have many friends who are in dead bedroom marriages, grew up with tons of friends whose parents had dead bedrooms and eventually led to divorce.  It\u2019s not black and white, it\u2019s messy and fluid.  \n\nIn many dead bedroom marriages a friendship and emotional companionship is still absolutely prevalent (aka why men want to cheat and don\u2019t have plans to leave their wives). My point is a single person doesn\u2019t have that freedom.  Let\u2019s say you see your SB 4 times a month and the rest of the month you\u2019re sharing dinners, conversation, life events with your SO.  It doesn\u2019t matter that you\u2019re not fucking your SO, your SB is (in the exclusive scenario) having to experience her downtime alone.\n\nAnd as a female that has been with married men in dead bedroom relationships I can PROMISE you things can absolutely change for various reasons... in which case why would a SB expect a SD to tell her \u201coh by the way my wife must have had an extra glass of wine last night and made the moves on me\u201d.  He\u2019s probably not going to, because he writes it off as okay in his mind (just as he writes off his SB).   And if he does tell her... what are we supposed to just sit around and say \u201cok maybe it was just one time\u201d.... \ud83d\ude44\n\nAnd a SB is not free to find a boyfriend in an exclusive relationship.  That\u2019s literally the point of the exclusivity... sex is a part of adult relationships so how would she be free to find a boyfriend ????? This is the year 2018... actively going on dates and getting to know people (usually people are \u201cseeing each other\u201d casually for a month+ before boyfriend title) usually involves sex. I personally don\u2019t have the time or desire to dip my feet in both ponds right now but I\u2019m still aware that it\u2019s a lose lose situation for a SB to be in an \u201cexclusive\u201d relationship with a married man.  She has zero control over what happens between he and his wife (or whether he is honest) and zero ability to even at all dip her toes into casual dating without ending the SR.  It\u2019s a double standard and it\u2019s just not fair or realistic.  \n",

She\u2019s saying the idea that \u201can STD test\u201d completely mitigates all risk is laughable.  You yourself agree that it is increasing your risk to have unprotected sex.. if you\u2019re engaging in risky behavior you\u2019re literally acting less responsibly.  \n\nI have no problem with a guy who owns that his behavior is risky as fuck, he could catch an STD at any moment, yet still prefers to go raw.  The problem is with the attempted \u201cnegotiation\u201d and convincing these guys do.  They try to minimize concerns... but the concerns are very valid! \n\nI would absolutely and have laughed in someone\u2019s face who attempted to tell me they were STD free and snipped in attempts to have unprotected sex with me.  I\u2019m not shaming them for their desires I\u2019m laughing at how illogical their responses are.  \n\nSo go ahead... if you want to propose no condom sex to me (which will always get a no) I will not shame your desire for the experience of raw sex... but if you start to  insinuate my concerns are irrelevant, or that it\u2019s perfectly safe and fine.... I will totally judge that.  99% of the men in the bowl who want raw sex would never stop to ask a SB for an STD test.  If (and that\u2019s a big if) they don\u2019t have an STD yet, it\u2019s only a matter of time. ",

You shame people for their honest views and yet your stance is built on a hypocritical and unhealthy view of exclusivity (since you are a married man sleeping with someone other than your wife). \n\nAnd yes, my SD is married.  He does not have another SB and I am not seeing anyone else but it is absolutely an open relationship as he has no intention to leave his wife.  He has even asked me about my love life outside of the SR.  He is in his 50s so he\u2019s by no means a millennial or new aged... he\u2019s just realistic!  Not having exclusivity does not always equate to a cock carousel.  And even if it did for someone, you really have no room to judge!  Perhaps if you had been more sexually liberated and honest about your sexual desires earlier in life you would not have ended up legally bound to a significant other that you felt like you needed to secretly step out on for sexual satisfaction.  \n\nThere is no need to shame women and men who are simply being realistic about this lifestyle.  That is why you are often downvoted \u2014 because you\u2019re not adding any value by degrading the entire community you\u2019re participating in.  You should be thankful for the SBs that don\u2019t demand exclusivity because despite what you tell yourself, what you are offering is not an exclusive relationship. ",

He is open with me about the fact that he is married and has no expectation for me to be exclusive because that would not make sense as he is not exclusive with me.  \n\nSo what is your point? He is not exclusive with me nor his wife therefore I should be exclusive to him??? How about just own what it is: you\u2019re stepping out of your marriage with no intention of leaving.  That is not offering an exclusive relationship and again, exclusivity does not go one way\n\nMy point is that even with mine and his \u201copen\u201d relationship status, we are not banging a bunch of other people.

Literally my point is that marriage is messy, muddy, life changes and people go through their own phases.  If you think that there is certainty of no future sex with your wife (unless there is medical condition preventing) then you are making a really ignorant assumption. I\u2019m not saying the sex will be often or good, but it\u2019s EXTREMELY possible for sex to happen in marriages that have experienced dry spells.  Often in life there are moments and influences that can influence people to try to spice back up their marriage... my example was something that could strike a chord either a steamy book or tv show, or a friend talking about their own divorce and it scaring them into making more of an effort, or perhaps them being worried about the husband having an affair.  I\u2019m also not stupid and have many friends who are in dead bedroom marriages, grew up with tons of friends whose parents had dead bedrooms and eventually led to divorce.  It\u2019s not black and white, it\u2019s messy and fluid.  \n\nIn many dead bedroom marriages a friendship and emotional companionship is still absolutely prevalent (aka why men want to cheat and don\u2019t have plans to leave their wives). My point is a single person doesn\u2019t have that freedom.  Let\u2019s say you see your SB 4 times a month and the rest of the month you\u2019re sharing dinners, conversation, life events with your SO.  It doesn\u2019t matter that you\u2019re not fucking your SO, your SB is (in the exclusive scenario) having to experience her downtime alone.\n\nAnd as a female that has been with married men in dead bedroom relationships I can PROMISE you things can absolutely change for various reasons... in which case why would a SB expect a SD to tell her \u201coh by the way my wife must have had an extra glass of wine last night and made the moves on me\u201d.  He\u2019s probably not going to, because he writes it off as okay in his mind (just as he writes off his SB).   And if he does tell her... what are we supposed to just sit around and say \u201cok maybe it was just one time\u201d.... \ud83d\ude44\n\nAnd a SB is not free to find a boyfriend in an exclusive relationship.  That\u2019s literally the point of the exclusivity... sex is a part of adult relationships so how would she be free to find a boyfriend ????? This is the year 2018... actively going on dates and getting to know people (usually people are \u201cseeing each other\u201d casually for a month+ before boyfriend title) usually involves sex. I personally don\u2019t have the time or desire to dip my feet in both ponds right now but I\u2019m still aware that it\u2019s a lose lose situation for a SB to be in an \u201cexclusive\u201d relationship with a married man.  She has zero control over what happens between he and his wife (or whether he is honest) and zero ability to even at all dip her toes into casual dating without ending the SR.  It\u2019s a double standard and it\u2019s just not fair or realistic.  \n",

She\u2019s saying the idea that \u201can STD test\u201d completely mitigates all risk is laughable.  You yourself agree that it is increasing your risk to have unprotected sex.. if you\u2019re engaging in risky behavior you\u2019re literally acting less responsibly.  \n\nI have no problem with a guy who owns that his behavior is risky as fuck, he could catch an STD at any moment, yet still prefers to go raw.  The problem is with the attempted \u201cnegotiation\u201d and convincing these guys do.  They try to minimize concerns... but the concerns are very valid! \n\nI would absolutely and have laughed in someone\u2019s face who attempted to tell me they were STD free and snipped in attempts to have unprotected sex with me.  I\u2019m not shaming them for their desires I\u2019m laughing at how illogical their responses are.  \n\nSo go ahead... if you want to propose no condom sex to me (which will always get a no) I will not shame your desire for the experience of raw sex... but if you start to  insinuate my concerns are irrelevant, or that it\u2019s perfectly safe and fine.... I will totally judge that.  99% of the men in the bowl who want raw sex would never stop to ask a SB for an STD test.  If (and that\u2019s a big if) they don\u2019t have an STD yet, it\u2019s only a matter of time. ",

You shame people for their honest views and yet your stance is built on a hypocritical and unhealthy view of exclusivity (since you are a married man sleeping with someone other than your wife). \n\nAnd yes, my SD is married.  He does not have another SB and I am not seeing anyone else but it is absolutely an open relationship as he has no intention to leave his wife.  He has even asked me about my love life outside of the SR.  He is in his 50s so he\u2019s by no means a millennial or new aged... he\u2019s just realistic!  Not having exclusivity does not always equate to a cock carousel.  And even if it did for someone, you really have no room to judge!  Perhaps if you had been more sexually liberated and honest about your sexual desires earlier in life you would not have ended up legally bound to a significant other that you felt like you needed to secretly step out on for sexual satisfaction.  \n\nThere is no need to shame women and men who are simply being realistic about this lifestyle.  That is why you are often downvoted \u2014 because you\u2019re not adding any value by degrading the entire community you\u2019re participating in.  You should be thankful for the SBs that don\u2019t demand exclusivity because despite what you tell yourself, what you are offering is not an exclusive relationship. ",

Literally my point is that marriage is messy, muddy, life changes and people go through their own phases.  If you think that there is certainty of no future sex with your wife (unless there is medical condition preventing) then you are making a really ignorant assumption. I\u2019m not saying the sex will be often or good, but it\u2019s EXTREMELY possible for sex to happen in marriages that have experienced dry spells.  Often in life there are moments and influences that can influence people to try to spice back up their marriage... my example was something that could strike a chord either a steamy book or tv show, or a friend talking about their own divorce and it scaring them into making more of an effort, or perhaps them being worried about the husband having an affair.  I\u2019m also not stupid and have many friends who are in dead bedroom marriages, grew up with tons of friends whose parents had dead bedrooms and eventually led to divorce.  It\u2019s not black and white, it\u2019s messy and fluid.  \n\nIn many dead bedroom marriages a friendship and emotional companionship is still absolutely prevalent (aka why men want to cheat and don\u2019t have plans to leave their wives). My point is a single person doesn\u2019t have that freedom.  Let\u2019s say you see your SB 4 times a month and the rest of the month you\u2019re sharing dinners, conversation, life events with your SO.  It doesn\u2019t matter that you\u2019re not fucking your SO, your SB is (in the exclusive scenario) having to experience her downtime alone.\n\nAnd as a female that has been with married men in dead bedroom relationships I can PROMISE you things can absolutely change for various reasons... in which case why would a SB expect a SD to tell her \u201coh by the way my wife must have had an extra glass of wine last night and made the moves on me\u201d.  He\u2019s probably not going to, because he writes it off as okay in his mind (just as he writes off his SB).   And if he does tell her... what are we supposed to just sit around and say \u201cok maybe it was just one time\u201d.... \ud83d\ude44\n\nAnd a SB is not free to find a boyfriend in an exclusive relationship.  That\u2019s literally the point of the exclusivity... sex is a part of adult relationships so how would she be free to find a boyfriend ????? This is the year 2018... actively going on dates and getting to know people (usually people are \u201cseeing each other\u201d casually for a month+ before boyfriend title) usually involves sex. I personally don\u2019t have the time or desire to dip my feet in both ponds right now but I\u2019m still aware that it\u2019s a lose lose situation for a SB to be in an \u201cexclusive\u201d relationship with a married man.  She has zero control over what happens between he and his wife (or whether he is honest) and zero ability to even at all dip her toes into casual dating without ending the SR.  It\u2019s a double standard and it\u2019s just not fair or realistic.  \n",

She\u2019s saying the idea that \u201can STD test\u201d completely mitigates all risk is laughable.  You yourself agree that it is increasing your risk to have unprotected sex.. if you\u2019re engaging in risky behavior you\u2019re literally acting less responsibly.  \n\nI have no problem with a guy who owns that his behavior is risky as fuck, he could catch an STD at any moment, yet still prefers to go raw.  The problem is with the attempted \u201cnegotiation\u201d and convincing these guys do.  They try to minimize concerns... but the concerns are very valid! \n\nI would absolutely and have laughed in someone\u2019s face who attempted to tell me they were STD free and snipped in attempts to have unprotected sex with me.  I\u2019m not shaming them for their desires I\u2019m laughing at how illogical their responses are.  \n\nSo go ahead... if you want to propose no condom sex to me (which will always get a no) I will not shame your desire for the experience of raw sex... but if you start to  insinuate my concerns are irrelevant, or that it\u2019s perfectly safe and fine.... I will totally judge that.  99% of the men in the bowl who want raw sex would never stop to ask a SB for an STD test.

He does not have another SB and I am not seeing anyone else but it is absolutely an open relationship as he has no intention to leave his wife.  He has even asked me about my love life outside of the SR.  He is in his 50s so he\u2019s by no means a millennial or new aged... he\u2019s just realistic!  Not having exclusivity does not always equate to a cock carousel.  And even if it did for someone, you really have no room to judge!  Perhaps if you had been more sexually liberated and honest about your sexual desires earlier in life you would not have ended up legally bound to a significant other that you felt like you needed to secretly step out on for sexual satisfaction.  \n\nThere is no need to shame women and men who are simply being realistic about this lifestyle.  That is why you are often downvoted \u2014 because you\u2019re not adding any value by degrading the entire community you\u2019re participating in.  You should be thankful for the SBs that don\u2019t demand exclusivity because despite what you tell yourself, what you are offering is not an exclusive relationship. ",

Literally my point is that marriage is messy, muddy, life changes and people go through their own phases.  If you think that there is certainty of no future sex with your wife (unless there is medical condition preventing) then you are making a really ignorant assumption. I\u2019m not saying the sex will be often or good, but it\u2019s EXTREMELY possible for sex to happen in marriages that have experienced dry spells.  Often in life there are moments and influences that can influence people to try to spice back up their marriage... my example was something that could strike a chord either a steamy book or tv show, or a friend talking about their own divorce and it scaring them into making more of an effort, or perhaps them being worried about the husband having an affair.  I\u2019m also not stupid and have many friends who are in dead bedroom marriages, grew up with tons of friends whose parents had dead bedrooms and eventually led to divorce.  It\u2019s not black and white, it\u2019s messy and fluid.  \n\nIn many dead bedroom marriages a friendship and emotional companionship is still absolutely prevalent (aka why men want to cheat and don\u2019t have plans to leave their wives). My point is a single person doesn\u2019t have that freedom.  Let\u2019s say you see your SB 4 times a month and the rest of the month you\u2019re sharing dinners, conversation, life events with your SO.  It doesn\u2019t matter that you\u2019re not fucking your SO, your SB is (in the exclusive scenario) having to experience her downtime alone.\n\nAnd as a female that has been with married men in dead bedroom relationships I can PROMISE you things can absolutely change for various reasons... in which case why would a SB expect a SD to tell her \u201coh by the way my wife must have had an extra glass of wine last night and made the moves on me\u201d.  He\u2019s probably not going to, because he writes it off as okay in his mind (just as he writes off his SB).   And if he does tell her... what are we supposed to just sit around and say \u201cok maybe it was just one time\u201d.... \ud83d\ude44\n\nAnd a SB is not free to find a boyfriend in an exclusive relationship.  That\u2019s literally the point of the exclusivity... sex is a part of adult relationships so how would she be free to find a boyfriend ????? This is the year 2018... actively going on dates and getting to know people (usually people are \u201cseeing each other\u201d casually for a month+ before boyfriend title) usually involves sex. I personally don\u2019t have the time or desire to dip my feet in both ponds right now but I\u2019m still aware that it\u2019s a lose lose situation for a SB to be in an \u201cexclusive\u201d relationship with a married man.  She has zero control over what happens between he and his wife (or whether he is honest) and zero ability to even at all dip her toes into casual dating without ending the SR.  It\u2019s a double standard and it\u2019s just not fair or realistic.  \n",

He does not have another SB and I am not seeing anyone else but it is absolutely an open relationship as he has no intention to leave his wife.  He has even asked me about my love life outside of the SR.  He is in his 50s so he\u2019s by no means a millennial or new aged... he\u2019s just realistic!  Not having exclusivity does not always equate to a cock carousel.  And even if it did for someone, you really have no room to judge!  Perhaps if you had been more sexually liberated and honest about your sexual desires earlier in life you would not have ended up legally bound to a significant other that you felt like you needed to secretly step out on for sexual satisfaction.  \n\nThere is no need to shame women and men who are simply being realistic about this lifestyle.  That is why you are often downvoted \u2014 because you\u2019re not adding any value by degrading the entire community you\u2019re participating in.  You should be thankful for the SBs that don\u2019t demand exclusivity because despite what you tell yourself, what you are offering is not an exclusive relationship. ",

Often in life there are moments and influences that can influence people to try to spice back up their marriage... my example was something that could strike a chord either a steamy book or tv show, or a friend talking about their own divorce and it scaring them into making more of an effort, or perhaps them being worried about the husband having an affair.  I\u2019m also not stupid and have many friends who are in dead bedroom marriages, grew up with tons of friends whose parents had dead bedrooms and eventually led to divorce.  It\u2019s not black and white, it\u2019s messy and fluid.  \n\nIn many dead bedroom marriages a friendship and emotional companionship is still absolutely prevalent (aka why men want to cheat and don\u2019t have plans to leave their wives). My point is a single person doesn\u2019t have that freedom.  Let\u2019s say you see your SB 4 times a month and the rest of the month you\u2019re sharing dinners, conversation, life events with your SO.  It doesn\u2019t matter that you\u2019re not fucking your SO, your SB is (in the exclusive scenario) having to experience her downtime alone.\n\nAnd as a female that has been with married men in dead bedroom relationships I can PROMISE you things can absolutely change for various reasons... in which case why would a SB expect a SD to tell her \u201coh by the way my wife must have had an extra glass of wine last night and made the moves on me\u201d.  He\u2019s probably not going to, because he writes it off as okay in his mind (just as he writes off his SB).   And if he does tell her... what are we supposed to just sit around and say \u201cok maybe it was just one time\u201d.... \ud83d\ude44\n\nAnd a SB is not free to find a boyfriend in an exclusive relationship.  That\u2019s literally the point of the exclusivity... sex is a part of adult relationships so how would she be free to find a boyfriend ????? This is the year 2018... actively going on dates and getting to know people (usually people are \u201cseeing each other\u201d casually for a month+ before boyfriend title) usually involves sex. I personally don\u2019t have the time or desire to dip my feet in both ponds right now but I\u2019m still aware that it\u2019s a lose lose situation for a SB to be in an \u201cexclusive\u201d relationship with a married man.  She has zero control over what happens between he and his wife (or whether he is honest) and zero ability to even at all dip her toes into casual dating without ending the SR.  It\u2019s a double standard and it\u2019s just not fair or realistic.  \n",

If you think that there is certainty of no future sex with your wife (unless there is medical condition preventing) then you are making a really ignorant assumption. I\u2019m not saying the sex will be often or good, but it\u2019s EXTREMELY possible for sex to happen in marriages that have experienced dry spells.  Often in life there are moments and influences that can influence people to try to spice back up their marriage... my example was something that could strike a chord either a steamy book or tv show, or a friend talking about their own divorce and it scaring them into making more of an effort, or perhaps them being worried about the husband having an affair.  I\u2019m also not stupid and have many friends who are in dead bedroom marriages, grew up with tons of friends whose parents had dead bedrooms and eventually led to divorce.  It\u2019s not black and white, it\u2019s messy and fluid.  \n\nIn many dead bedroom marriages a friendship and emotional companionship is still absolutely prevalent (aka why men want to cheat and don\u2019t have plans to leave their wives). My point is a single person doesn\u2019t have that freedom.  Let\u2019s say you see your SB 4 times a month and the rest of the month you\u2019re sharing dinners, conversation, life events with your SO.  It doesn\u2019t matter that you\u2019re not fucking your SO, your SB is (in the exclusive scenario) having to experience her downtime alone.\n\nAnd as a female that has been with married men in dead bedroom relationships I can PROMISE you things can absolutely change for various reasons... in which case why would a SB expect a SD to tell her \u201coh by the way my wife must have had an extra glass of wine last night and made the moves on me\u201d.  He\u2019s probably not going to, because he writes it off as okay in his mind (just as he writes off his SB).

She has zero control over what happens between he and his wife (or whether he is honest) and zero ability to even at all dip her toes into casual dating without ending the SR.

Often in life there are moments and influences that can influence people to try to spice back up their marriage... my example was something that could strike a chord either a steamy book or tv show, or a friend talking about their own divorce and it scaring them into making more of an effort, or perhaps them being worried about the husband having an affair.  I\u2019m also not stupid and have many friends who are in dead bedroom marriages, grew up with tons of friends whose parents had dead bedrooms and eventually led to divorce.  It\u2019s not black and white, it\u2019s messy and fluid.  \n\nIn many dead bedroom marriages a friendship and emotional companionship is still absolutely prevalent (aka why men want to cheat and don\u2019t have plans to leave their wives). My point is a single person doesn\u2019t have that freedom.  Let\u2019s say you see your SB 4 times a month and the rest of the month you\u2019re sharing dinners, conversation, life events with your SO.  It doesn\u2019t matter that you\u2019re not fucking your SO, your SB is (in the exclusive scenario) having to experience her downtime alone.\n\nAnd as a female that has been with married men in dead bedroom relationships I can PROMISE you things can absolutely change for various reasons... in which case why would a SB expect a SD to tell her \u201coh by the way my wife must have had an extra glass of wine last night and made the moves on me\u201d.  He\u2019s probably not going to, because he writes it off as okay in his mind (just as he writes off his SB).   And if he does tell her... what are we supposed to just sit around and say \u201cok maybe it was just one time\u201d.... \ud83d\ude44\n\nAnd a SB is not free to find a boyfriend in an exclusive relationship.  That\u2019s literally the point of the exclusivity... sex is a part of adult relationships so how would she be free to find a boyfriend ????? This is the year 2018... actively going on dates and getting to know people (usually people are \u201cseeing each other\u201d casually for a month+ before boyfriend title) usually involves sex. I personally don\u2019t have the time or desire to dip my feet in both ponds right now but I\u2019m still aware that it\u2019s a lose lose situation for a SB to be in an \u201cexclusive\u201d relationship with a married man.  She has zero control over what happens between he and his wife (or whether he is honest) and zero ability to even at all dip her toes into casual dating without ending the SR.  It\u2019s a double standard and it\u2019s just not fair or realistic.  \n",
