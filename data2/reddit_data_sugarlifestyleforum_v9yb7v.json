    "body": "My wonderful and sweet Sugar Daddy knew I was going through a rough break up with someone else and so he got me two kittens and took me shopping to get anything and everything they might need \ud83e\udd70 My last cat passed away a year ago and he knew I\u2019d been waiting to get another. The timing was just right and helped remind me why I love him as much as I do and why this dynamic works for us both.\n\nJust a little wholesome share for you curmudgeons and aspiring SBs",
