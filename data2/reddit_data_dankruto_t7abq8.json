But their rank is pretty explicitly above chunin and below jonin.\n\nI don't know how much trust you have in the Naruto wiki but, \"Special Jonin (Tokubetsu Jonin; Literally meaning \"Special High Ninja\") are ninja who, rather than all-around Jonin training, have j\u014dnin-level ability in a specific area or skill, much like warrant officers in real-world militaries. They are elite specialists in their areas and **are often assigned as subordinates to regular j\u014dnin when their services are needed.**\"",
