The most lenient being having at least 5 o'clock shadow. The most strict being leaving it alone and no trimming at all. I choose to follow the middle path of a full beard that I trim occasionally to make it look nice. \n\nSide note: the mustache has its own opinions but for sure I can't just have a mustache alone. \n\nLoll hope that helps a little.",

The most lenient being having at least 5 o'clock shadow. The most strict being leaving it alone and no trimming at all. I choose to follow the middle path of a full beard that I trim occasionally to make it look nice. \n\nSide note: the mustache has its own opinions but for sure I can't just have a mustache alone. \n\nLoll hope that helps a little.",
