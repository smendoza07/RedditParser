If your inbox is so full...why do you need a profile review?! Just an observation. For the record - we dont believe you.\n\n\nEDIT: absolutely nothing is wrong with asking for a profile review - and nowhere did I state that. What I DID say is weird is the defensive response to criticism of said profiles...",

I\u2019ve considered posting mine in order to help other SBs by giving an example of what a successful profile looks like, because I\u2019ve never had an issue and often get compliments on my written portion.

I told the first one I\u2019d send her screens after confirming she\u2019s a SB and not a SD, but I don\u2019t feel comfortable mass producing images of my SA profile. Please don\u2019t message me asking for it! I\u2019ll share it in a post myself if I ever feel comfortable doing so. I am more than willing to give tips and advice!

I did write about what I\u2019m interested in and have to offer and am fairly detailed. The men that appreciate this are apparent when they message me, which makes things easier for everyone involved.\n\nEdit: I agree that writing several paragraphs that somehow still don\u2019t make it clear what you\u2019re interested in/looking for/have to offer would be ridiculous.

I did write about what I\u2019m interested in and have to offer and am fairly detailed.

I\u2019ve seen a few SD profiles go on and on and still actually say absolutely nothing about them. That\u2019s annoying and futile. Lmao",
