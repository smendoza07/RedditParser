He needs people to back him up. He needed to form bonds to get to where he was.\n\nGiving this motivation to Sasuke makes him another obstacle that Naruto needs to overcome not just physically, but thematically as well. It made the fight far more powerful in my opinion.",

And in a way he was right. The shinobi system us fucked and regardless if the reasoning all of naruto, itachi, gaara, sasuke, the jinchuriki's suffering came from the kages. Those decisions eventually lead to other conflicts. The way sasuke saw it was that the kages knew that this world was fucked up but did nothing to change it or make it better and would rather fight than have peace not caring for the people who sacrifice themselves to uphold that peace. Sasuke wanted world peace and unlike madara he wasnt gonna put the world in a genjutsu he was just gonna become the ultimate threat that would never die",

And in a way he was right. The shinobi system us fucked and regardless if the reasoning all of naruto, itachi, gaara, sasuke, the jinchuriki's suffering came from the kages. Those decisions eventually lead to other conflicts. The way sasuke saw it was that the kages knew that this world was fucked up but did nothing to change it or make it better and would rather fight than have peace not caring for the people who sacrifice themselves to uphold that peace. Sasuke wanted world peace and unlike madara he wasnt gonna put the world in a genjutsu he was just gonna become the ultimate threat that would never die",

And in a way he was right. The shinobi system us fucked and regardless if the reasoning all of naruto, itachi, gaara, sasuke, the jinchuriki's suffering came from the kages. Those decisions eventually lead to other conflicts. The way sasuke saw it was that the kages knew that this world was fucked up but did nothing to change it or make it better and would rather fight than have peace not caring for the people who sacrifice themselves to uphold that peace. Sasuke wanted world peace and unlike madara he wasnt gonna put the world in a genjutsu he was just gonna become the ultimate threat that would never die",
