There's no mention of them fighting in any wars except the 4th, and most of them aren't actually that strong. To put in perspective, neji had the strongest byakugon when he was only, what, 13? Its confirmed by the then strongest hyuuga, Hiashi. And we don't actually see any sarutobi clan members besides the 3rd hokage, asuma and konohamaru. Im pretty sure konohamarus parents were ANBU, I think its in a light novel, but idk. And inoshikacho is kinda weak, let's be honest. Like they are strong, but they ain't fighting no killer B or A. And jiraiya is just 1 person who wasn't involved in the leafs matters anymore and wasn't concerned with them. \n\nHonestly, the only thing that I could see making the leaf the stronger power after the the Uchiha massacre would be the 9 tails and danzo. If they took the 9 tails from Naruto, danzo could in theory control it with shisuis sharigan. Or Kakashi might even be able to with his mangekyo. Honestly the leaf is just op as fuck, but killer B and A are making me really unsure of where I'd rank the leaf at that moment in time. Like top 2 for sure, but danzo and root don't get involved with wars and fights, they didn't have the legendary sanin, the 9 tails was sealed in Naruto and none of them have the seal knowledge to break it so they don't have the 9 tails, and of course no Uchiha. They are still a major power, but idk if id put them number 1 at that specific point in time",

How do you think Ao got the byakugan? All shinobi fight in the wars their village participate in thats what a shinobi is.  Even the uchiha fought in the 3rd shinobi war after they were restricted to being village police.  The sarutobi clan is literally shown fighting the 10tails with water and fore styles during the war arc.  Ino Shika Cho is legendary in the show for a reason.  Shikas can literally kill dozens of shinobi with shadow strangle jutsu, the inos can mind use mind control to make shinobi fight people on their own side, the Chos are literal giants who have the most physical power in the entire shinobi world besides outliers.  On top of all that, B is restricted from fighting im any battles because hes a village defense and A doesnt want anything to happen to him. Watch the show.",

And I thought ao got his byakugon during a peace signing they were doing with the leaf? And I know inoshikacho is legendary, but we hardly see them doing anything. The inoshikacho of the generation before narutos generation doesn't stack up, and id actually say As clan in the cloud has more physical power. I mean the 3rd raikage fought against the 8 tails on his own and didn't get a single scratch until he injured himself. And the 4th raikage, while not on that level, can still fight with tailed beast. Nobody in the leaf at that time can come close in physical strength.",

In case of an attack on the leaf they would help for sure, but they\u2019d arrive late since it\u2019s the same as what would happen in canon just with the villages switched.\n\nNaruto really shouldn\u2019t be counted as an Uzumaki either since the only Uzumaki attribute he demonstrates is being able to hold back a tailed beast (not exclusive to the Uzumaki though), most of his strength is from Kurama.\n\nOf the three other clans two are well known to be nearly extinct and the other one is notoriously cautious. I\u2019d argue it\u2019s still the strongest village until the Uchiha massacre, Tsunade leaving having them bumped them to a little above Kumo, with the near extinction of the Uzumaki not having much of an impact as long as Konoha is destroyed in three days.",

And a personal theory of mine is that Uzumaki\u2019s don\u2019t necessarily have big reserves, but rather insanely fast regeneration. Sasuke can make only a few clones with his chakra at the start of the show so we can assume that it isn\u2019t too chakra heavy, but when we see Naruto do a powerful jutsu he always has to rely on kurama. It\u2019s possible that he can make thousands of clones not because the price is nothing compared to his capacity, but because he can recover the chakra almost instantly.",

Remember when he was beginning his training with Jiraya before the chunin exam, when Jiraya through his ass in the crater and he summoned chief toad? Look at the color of the chakra output. While most of it was red and Kuramas chakra there was still a good deal of blue from his own chakra. \n\nAgain this was back before he had any control of his chakra and didn\u2019t have a clue on how to utilize Kuramas chakra, I just always thought that particular scene was interesting. It\u2019s doubtful that even with superior control of chakra that Sauske or Sakura could have utilized as much as he did. Just judging by that scene he was producing just as much chakra uncontrolled as Neji produces for his rotation. Which at the time Neji was a far superior shinobi from age and abilities through feats and control. Not too mention his own special abilities with his byakugan.\n\nThat\u2019s the only time I can remember a pure representation of his chakra vs the chakra of Kurama (minus the entire battle of will blah blah blah). At that age and that level he was producing a large amount of chakra. Just something that caught my eye and thought it was an interesting topic for this conversation.",

There's no mention of them fighting in any wars except the 4th, and most of them aren't actually that strong. To put in perspective, neji had the strongest byakugon when he was only, what, 13? Its confirmed by the then strongest hyuuga, Hiashi. And we don't actually see any sarutobi clan members besides the 3rd hokage, asuma and konohamaru. Im pretty sure konohamarus parents were ANBU, I think its in a light novel, but idk. And inoshikacho is kinda weak, let's be honest. Like they are strong, but they ain't fighting no killer B or A. And jiraiya is just 1 person who wasn't involved in the leafs matters anymore and wasn't concerned with them. \n\nHonestly, the only thing that I could see making the leaf the stronger power after the the Uchiha massacre would be the 9 tails and danzo. If they took the 9 tails from Naruto, danzo could in theory control it with shisuis sharigan. Or Kakashi might even be able to with his mangekyo. Honestly the leaf is just op as fuck, but killer B and A are making me really unsure of where I'd rank the leaf at that moment in time. Like top 2 for sure, but danzo and root don't get involved with wars and fights, they didn't have the legendary sanin, the 9 tails was sealed in Naruto and none of them have the seal knowledge to break it so they don't have the 9 tails, and of course no Uchiha. They are still a major power, but idk if id put them number 1 at that specific point in time",

The sarutobi clan is literally shown fighting the 10tails with water and fore styles during the war arc.  Ino Shika Cho is legendary in the show for a reason.  Shikas can literally kill dozens of shinobi with shadow strangle jutsu, the inos can mind use mind control to make shinobi fight people on their own side, the Chos are literal giants who have the most physical power in the entire shinobi world besides outliers.  On top of all that, B is restricted from fighting im any battles because hes a village defense and A doesnt want anything to happen to him. Watch the show.",

The inoshikacho of the generation before narutos generation doesn't stack up, and id actually say As clan in the cloud has more physical power. I mean the 3rd raikage fought against the 8 tails on his own and didn't get a single scratch until he injured himself. And the 4th raikage, while not on that level, can still fight with tailed beast.

In case of an attack on the leaf they would help for sure, but they\u2019d arrive late since it\u2019s the same as what would happen in canon just with the villages switched.\n\nNaruto really shouldn\u2019t be counted as an Uzumaki either since the only Uzumaki attribute he demonstrates is being able to hold back a tailed beast (not exclusive to the Uzumaki though), most of his strength is from Kurama.\n\nOf the three other clans two are well known to be nearly extinct and the other one is notoriously cautious. I\u2019d argue it\u2019s still the strongest village until the Uchiha massacre, Tsunade leaving having them bumped them to a little above Kumo, with the near extinction of the Uzumaki not having much of an impact as long as Konoha is destroyed in three days.",

And a personal theory of mine is that Uzumaki\u2019s don\u2019t necessarily have big reserves, but rather insanely fast regeneration. Sasuke can make only a few clones with his chakra at the start of the show so we can assume that it isn\u2019t too chakra heavy, but when we see Naruto do a powerful jutsu he always has to rely on kurama. It\u2019s possible that he can make thousands of clones not because the price is nothing compared to his capacity, but because he can recover the chakra almost instantly.",

Remember when he was beginning his training with Jiraya before the chunin exam, when Jiraya through his ass in the crater and he summoned chief toad? Look at the color of the chakra output. While most of it was red and Kuramas chakra there was still a good deal of blue from his own chakra. \n\nAgain this was back before he had any control of his chakra and didn\u2019t have a clue on how to utilize Kuramas chakra, I just always thought that particular scene was interesting. It\u2019s doubtful that even with superior control of chakra that Sauske or Sakura could have utilized as much as he did. Just judging by that scene he was producing just as much chakra uncontrolled as Neji produces for his rotation. Which at the time Neji was a far superior shinobi from age and abilities through feats and control. Not too mention his own special abilities with his byakugan.\n\nThat\u2019s the only time I can remember a pure representation of his chakra vs the chakra of Kurama (minus the entire battle of will blah blah blah). At that age and that level he was producing a large amount of chakra. Just something that caught my eye and thought it was an interesting topic for this conversation.",

There's no mention of them fighting in any wars except the 4th, and most of them aren't actually that strong. To put in perspective, neji had the strongest byakugon when he was only, what, 13? Its confirmed by the then strongest hyuuga, Hiashi. And we don't actually see any sarutobi clan members besides the 3rd hokage, asuma and konohamaru. Im pretty sure konohamarus parents were ANBU, I think its in a light novel, but idk. And inoshikacho is kinda weak, let's be honest. Like they are strong, but they ain't fighting no killer B or A. And jiraiya is just 1 person who wasn't involved in the leafs matters anymore and wasn't concerned with them. \n\nHonestly, the only thing that I could see making the leaf the stronger power after the the Uchiha massacre would be the 9 tails and danzo. If they took the 9 tails from Naruto, danzo could in theory control it with shisuis sharigan. Or Kakashi might even be able to with his mangekyo. Honestly the leaf is just op as fuck, but killer B and A are making me really unsure of where I'd rank the leaf at that moment in time. Like top 2 for sure, but danzo and root don't get involved with wars and fights, they didn't have the legendary sanin, the 9 tails was sealed in Naruto and none of them have the seal knowledge to break it so they don't have the 9 tails, and of course no Uchiha. They are still a major power, but idk if id put them number 1 at that specific point in time",

The sarutobi clan is literally shown fighting the 10tails with water and fore styles during the war arc.  Ino Shika Cho is legendary in the show for a reason.  Shikas can literally kill dozens of shinobi with shadow strangle jutsu, the inos can mind use mind control to make shinobi fight people on their own side, the Chos are literal giants who have the most physical power in the entire shinobi world besides outliers.

The inoshikacho of the generation before narutos generation doesn't stack up, and id actually say As clan in the cloud has more physical power. I mean the 3rd raikage fought against the 8 tails on his own and didn't get a single scratch until he injured himself. And the 4th raikage, while not on that level, can still fight with tailed beast.

In case of an attack on the leaf they would help for sure, but they\u2019d arrive late since it\u2019s the same as what would happen in canon just with the villages switched.\n\nNaruto really shouldn\u2019t be counted as an Uzumaki either since the only Uzumaki attribute he demonstrates is being able to hold back a tailed beast (not exclusive to the Uzumaki though), most of his strength is from Kurama.\n\nOf the three other clans two are well known to be nearly extinct and the other one is notoriously cautious. I\u2019d argue it\u2019s still the strongest village until the Uchiha massacre, Tsunade leaving having them bumped them to a little above Kumo, with the near extinction of the Uzumaki not having much of an impact as long as Konoha is destroyed in three days.",

And a personal theory of mine is that Uzumaki\u2019s don\u2019t necessarily have big reserves, but rather insanely fast regeneration. Sasuke can make only a few clones with his chakra at the start of the show so we can assume that it isn\u2019t too chakra heavy, but when we see Naruto do a powerful jutsu he always has to rely on kurama. It\u2019s possible that he can make thousands of clones not because the price is nothing compared to his capacity, but because he can recover the chakra almost instantly.",

While most of it was red and Kuramas chakra there was still a good deal of blue from his own chakra. \n\nAgain this was back before he had any control of his chakra and didn\u2019t have a clue on how to utilize Kuramas chakra, I just always thought that particular scene was interesting. It\u2019s doubtful that even with superior control of chakra that Sauske or Sakura could have utilized as much as he did. Just judging by that scene he was producing just as much chakra uncontrolled as Neji produces for his rotation. Which at the time Neji was a far superior shinobi from age and abilities through feats and control. Not too mention his own special abilities with his byakugan.\n\nThat\u2019s the only time I can remember a pure representation of his chakra vs the chakra of Kurama (minus the entire battle of will blah blah blah). At that age and that level he was producing a large amount of chakra. Just something that caught my eye and thought it was an interesting topic for this conversation.",

To put in perspective, neji had the strongest byakugon when he was only, what, 13? Its confirmed by the then strongest hyuuga, Hiashi. And we don't actually see any sarutobi clan members besides the 3rd hokage, asuma and konohamaru. Im pretty sure konohamarus parents were ANBU, I think its in a light novel, but idk. And inoshikacho is kinda weak, let's be honest. Like they are strong, but they ain't fighting no killer B or A. And jiraiya is just 1 person who wasn't involved in the leafs matters anymore and wasn't concerned with them. \n\nHonestly, the only thing that I could see making the leaf the stronger power after the the Uchiha massacre would be the 9 tails and danzo. If they took the 9 tails from Naruto, danzo could in theory control it with shisuis sharigan. Or Kakashi might even be able to with his mangekyo. Honestly the leaf is just op as fuck, but killer B and A are making me really unsure of where I'd rank the leaf at that moment in time. Like top 2 for sure, but danzo and root don't get involved with wars and fights, they didn't have the legendary sanin, the 9 tails was sealed in Naruto and none of them have the seal knowledge to break it so they don't have the 9 tails, and of course no Uchiha. They are still a major power, but idk if id put them number 1 at that specific point in time",

Even the uchiha fought in the 3rd shinobi war after they were restricted to being village police.  The sarutobi clan is literally shown fighting the 10tails with water and fore styles during the war arc.  Ino Shika Cho is legendary in the show for a reason.  Shikas can literally kill dozens of shinobi with shadow strangle jutsu, the inos can mind use mind control to make shinobi fight people on their own side, the Chos are literal giants who have the most physical power in the entire shinobi world besides outliers.

The inoshikacho of the generation before narutos generation doesn't stack up, and id actually say As clan in the cloud has more physical power. I mean the 3rd raikage fought against the 8 tails on his own and didn't get a single scratch until he injured himself. And the 4th raikage, while not on that level, can still fight with tailed beast.

And a personal theory of mine is that Uzumaki\u2019s don\u2019t necessarily have big reserves, but rather insanely fast regeneration. Sasuke can make only a few clones with his chakra at the start of the show so we can assume that it isn\u2019t too chakra heavy, but when we see Naruto do a powerful jutsu he always has to rely on kurama. It\u2019s possible that he can make thousands of clones not because the price is nothing compared to his capacity, but because he can recover the chakra almost instantly.",

Remember when he was beginning his training with Jiraya before the chunin exam, when Jiraya through his ass in the crater and he summoned chief toad? Look at the color of the chakra output. While most of it was red and Kuramas chakra there was still a good deal of blue from his own chakra. \n\nAgain this was back before he had any control of his chakra and didn\u2019t have a clue on how to utilize Kuramas chakra, I just always thought that particular scene was interesting. It\u2019s doubtful that even with superior control of chakra that Sauske or Sakura could have utilized as much as he did. Just judging by that scene he was producing just as much chakra uncontrolled as Neji produces for his rotation. Which at the time Neji was a far superior shinobi from age and abilities through feats and control. Not too mention his own special abilities with his byakugan.\n\nThat\u2019s the only time I can remember a pure representation of his chakra vs the chakra of Kurama (minus the entire battle of will blah blah blah). At that age and that level he was producing a large amount of chakra. Just something that caught my eye and thought it was an interesting topic for this conversation.",

To put in perspective, neji had the strongest byakugon when he was only, what, 13? Its confirmed by the then strongest hyuuga, Hiashi. And we don't actually see any sarutobi clan members besides the 3rd hokage, asuma and konohamaru. Im pretty sure konohamarus parents were ANBU, I think its in a light novel, but idk. And inoshikacho is kinda weak, let's be honest. Like they are strong, but they ain't fighting no killer B or A. And jiraiya is just 1 person who wasn't involved in the leafs matters anymore and wasn't concerned with them. \n\nHonestly, the only thing that I could see making the leaf the stronger power after the the Uchiha massacre would be the 9 tails and danzo. If they took the 9 tails from Naruto, danzo could in theory control it with shisuis sharigan. Or Kakashi might even be able to with his mangekyo. Honestly the leaf is just op as fuck, but killer B and A are making me really unsure of where I'd rank the leaf at that moment in time. Like top 2 for sure, but danzo and root don't get involved with wars and fights, they didn't have the legendary sanin, the 9 tails was sealed in Naruto and none of them have the seal knowledge to break it so they don't have the 9 tails, and of course no Uchiha. They are still a major power, but idk if id put them number 1 at that specific point in time",

The sarutobi clan is literally shown fighting the 10tails with water and fore styles during the war arc.  Ino Shika Cho is legendary in the show for a reason.  Shikas can literally kill dozens of shinobi with shadow strangle jutsu, the inos can mind use mind control to make shinobi fight people on their own side, the Chos are literal giants who have the most physical power in the entire shinobi world besides outliers.

The inoshikacho of the generation before narutos generation doesn't stack up, and id actually say As clan in the cloud has more physical power. I mean the 3rd raikage fought against the 8 tails on his own and didn't get a single scratch until he injured himself. And the 4th raikage, while not on that level, can still fight with tailed beast.

I\u2019d argue it\u2019s still the strongest village until the Uchiha massacre, Tsunade leaving having them bumped them to a little above Kumo, with the near extinction of the Uzumaki not having much of an impact as long as Konoha is destroyed in three days.",

And a personal theory of mine is that Uzumaki\u2019s don\u2019t necessarily have big reserves, but rather insanely fast regeneration. Sasuke can make only a few clones with his chakra at the start of the show so we can assume that it isn\u2019t too chakra heavy, but when we see Naruto do a powerful jutsu he always has to rely on kurama. It\u2019s possible that he can make thousands of clones not because the price is nothing compared to his capacity, but because he can recover the chakra almost instantly.",

Remember when he was beginning his training with Jiraya before the chunin exam, when Jiraya through his ass in the crater and he summoned chief toad? Look at the color of the chakra output. While most of it was red and Kuramas chakra there was still a good deal of blue from his own chakra. \n\nAgain this was back before he had any control of his chakra and didn\u2019t have a clue on how to utilize Kuramas chakra, I just always thought that particular scene was interesting. It\u2019s doubtful that even with superior control of chakra that Sauske or Sakura could have utilized as much as he did. Just judging by that scene he was producing just as much chakra uncontrolled as Neji produces for his rotation. Which at the time Neji was a far superior shinobi from age and abilities through feats and control. Not too mention his own special abilities with his byakugan.\n\nThat\u2019s the only time I can remember a pure representation of his chakra vs the chakra of Kurama (minus the entire battle of will blah blah blah). At that age and that level he was producing a large amount of chakra. Just something that caught my eye and thought it was an interesting topic for this conversation.",

To put in perspective, neji had the strongest byakugon when he was only, what, 13? Its confirmed by the then strongest hyuuga, Hiashi. And we don't actually see any sarutobi clan members besides the 3rd hokage, asuma and konohamaru. Im pretty sure konohamarus parents were ANBU, I think its in a light novel, but idk. And inoshikacho is kinda weak, let's be honest. Like they are strong, but they ain't fighting no killer B or A. And jiraiya is just 1 person who wasn't involved in the leafs matters anymore and wasn't concerned with them. \n\nHonestly, the only thing that I could see making the leaf the stronger power after the the Uchiha massacre would be the 9 tails and danzo. If they took the 9 tails from Naruto, danzo could in theory control it with shisuis sharigan. Or Kakashi might even be able to with his mangekyo. Honestly the leaf is just op as fuck, but killer B and A are making me really unsure of where I'd rank the leaf at that moment in time. Like top 2 for sure, but danzo and root don't get involved with wars and fights, they didn't have the legendary sanin, the 9 tails was sealed in Naruto and none of them have the seal knowledge to break it so they don't have the 9 tails, and of course no Uchiha. They are still a major power, but idk if id put them number 1 at that specific point in time",

The sarutobi clan is literally shown fighting the 10tails with water and fore styles during the war arc.  Ino Shika Cho is legendary in the show for a reason.  Shikas can literally kill dozens of shinobi with shadow strangle jutsu, the inos can mind use mind control to make shinobi fight people on their own side, the Chos are literal giants who have the most physical power in the entire shinobi world besides outliers.  On top of all that, B is restricted from fighting im any battles because hes a village defense and A doesnt want anything to happen to him. Watch the show.",

And I thought ao got his byakugon during a peace signing they were doing with the leaf? And I know inoshikacho is legendary, but we hardly see them doing anything. The inoshikacho of the generation before narutos generation doesn't stack up, and id actually say As clan in the cloud has more physical power. I mean the 3rd raikage fought against the 8 tails on his own and didn't get a single scratch until he injured himself. And the 4th raikage, while not on that level, can still fight with tailed beast. Nobody in the leaf at that time can come close in physical strength.",

And a personal theory of mine is that Uzumaki\u2019s don\u2019t necessarily have big reserves, but rather insanely fast regeneration. Sasuke can make only a few clones with his chakra at the start of the show so we can assume that it isn\u2019t too chakra heavy, but when we see Naruto do a powerful jutsu he always has to rely on kurama. It\u2019s possible that he can make thousands of clones not because the price is nothing compared to his capacity, but because he can recover the chakra almost instantly.",

Remember when he was beginning his training with Jiraya before the chunin exam, when Jiraya through his ass in the crater and he summoned chief toad? Look at the color of the chakra output. While most of it was red and Kuramas chakra there was still a good deal of blue from his own chakra. \n\nAgain this was back before he had any control of his chakra and didn\u2019t have a clue on how to utilize Kuramas chakra, I just always thought that particular scene was interesting. It\u2019s doubtful that even with superior control of chakra that Sauske or Sakura could have utilized as much as he did. Just judging by that scene he was producing just as much chakra uncontrolled as Neji produces for his rotation. Which at the time Neji was a far superior shinobi from age and abilities through feats and control. Not too mention his own special abilities with his byakugan.\n\nThat\u2019s the only time I can remember a pure representation of his chakra vs the chakra of Kurama (minus the entire battle of will blah blah blah). At that age and that level he was producing a large amount of chakra. Just something that caught my eye and thought it was an interesting topic for this conversation.",

The sarutobi clan is literally shown fighting the 10tails with water and fore styles during the war arc.  Ino Shika Cho is legendary in the show for a reason.  Shikas can literally kill dozens of shinobi with shadow strangle jutsu, the inos can mind use mind control to make shinobi fight people on their own side, the Chos are literal giants who have the most physical power in the entire shinobi world besides outliers.

The inoshikacho of the generation before narutos generation doesn't stack up, and id actually say As clan in the cloud has more physical power. I mean the 3rd raikage fought against the 8 tails on his own and didn't get a single scratch until he injured himself. And the 4th raikage, while not on that level, can still fight with tailed beast.

And a personal theory of mine is that Uzumaki\u2019s don\u2019t necessarily have big reserves, but rather insanely fast regeneration. Sasuke can make only a few clones with his chakra at the start of the show so we can assume that it isn\u2019t too chakra heavy, but when we see Naruto do a powerful jutsu he always has to rely on kurama. It\u2019s possible that he can make thousands of clones not because the price is nothing compared to his capacity, but because he can recover the chakra almost instantly.",

Remember when he was beginning his training with Jiraya before the chunin exam, when Jiraya through his ass in the crater and he summoned chief toad? Look at the color of the chakra output. While most of it was red and Kuramas chakra there was still a good deal of blue from his own chakra. \n\nAgain this was back before he had any control of his chakra and didn\u2019t have a clue on how to utilize Kuramas chakra, I just always thought that particular scene was interesting. It\u2019s doubtful that even with superior control of chakra that Sauske or Sakura could have utilized as much as he did. Just judging by that scene he was producing just as much chakra uncontrolled as Neji produces for his rotation. Which at the time Neji was a far superior shinobi from age and abilities through feats and control. Not too mention his own special abilities with his byakugan.\n\nThat\u2019s the only time I can remember a pure representation of his chakra vs the chakra of Kurama (minus the entire battle of will blah blah blah). At that age and that level he was producing a large amount of chakra. Just something that caught my eye and thought it was an interesting topic for this conversation.",

The inoshikacho of the generation before narutos generation doesn't stack up, and id actually say As clan in the cloud has more physical power. I mean the 3rd raikage fought against the 8 tails on his own and didn't get a single scratch until he injured himself. And the 4th raikage, while not on that level, can still fight with tailed beast. Nobody in the leaf at that time can come close in physical strength.",

Remember when he was beginning his training with Jiraya before the chunin exam, when Jiraya through his ass in the crater and he summoned chief toad? Look at the color of the chakra output. While most of it was red and Kuramas chakra there was still a good deal of blue from his own chakra. \n\nAgain this was back before he had any control of his chakra and didn\u2019t have a clue on how to utilize Kuramas chakra, I just always thought that particular scene was interesting. It\u2019s doubtful that even with superior control of chakra that Sauske or Sakura could have utilized as much as he did. Just judging by that scene he was producing just as much chakra uncontrolled as Neji produces for his rotation. Which at the time Neji was a far superior shinobi from age and abilities through feats and control. Not too mention his own special abilities with his byakugan.\n\nThat\u2019s the only time I can remember a pure representation of his chakra vs the chakra of Kurama (minus the entire battle of will blah blah blah). At that age and that level he was producing a large amount of chakra. Just something that caught my eye and thought it was an interesting topic for this conversation.",
