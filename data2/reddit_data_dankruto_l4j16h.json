The stakes are high which makes the conclusion so much more satisfying. \n\nI think this is why watching shikamaru is so satisfying. Since he will always be analytical, a major part of his fighting style is knowing his limits, hence they can\u2019t be ignored when writing the fight. This is unlike naruto who\u2019s powerlevel is much less defined and he is often the subject of \u201cdivine intervention\u201d rather than pure skill. Every time shikamaru duels someone you can tell he\u2019s using all of his abilities to achieve victory, without any sort of bullshit to save the day for him.",

In contrast I can't ever seem to warm up to Hinita. She is just too boring, meek, and werid for me to like her. It would have been nice to see her actually sacrifice herself to save Naruto and Neji, as almost an inverse of Neji's dad sacrificing his life to save his brother's life, it would also shown that Hinita's love was a selfless love rather than just \"he cute and he must be mine\", rather than the selfish love we  got since she hated how Naruto was finally getting recognized by everyone else and getting some much deserved love from everyone.",

Instead of seeing the characters grow first, we are constantly shown just how much powerful they can become and because of that, the story doesn't always seem as interesting anymore.\n\nWe all knew that Naruto would get so powerful because of the implied power of Kurama and how much power it would bring to Naruto.\n\nEven Dragonball Super. while Ultra Instinct and Vegeta's new powers are awesome, that's pretty much all I like about Dragon Super. We don't really have the characters face consequences because of sensu beans, dragonballs, gods and angels helping them.",

None of the Kaguya stuff, none of the reincarnation stuff. \n\nBut it would have taken some of the focus away from Naruto and Sasuke, and it seems that Kishi wasn\u2019t willing to do that.",

They would\u2019ve gotten their boosts from SOSP too. Because the whole kaguya thing made Madara irrelevant anyways so why not have Guy kick his ass, let his Eight Gates, which were kept on mantle just behind the shadow to come out as truly elite. I mean Madara literally pulled a Buu when he healed from it. So why even bother might as well have ended it there. But, no the whole thing was going downhill the moment Pain ended, so why not run it completely into the ground.",

The only one left with a reasonable card to play was Guy, and he needed to lose so that Naruto and Sasuke could step up to win. That\u2019s the decision Kishi made, to sacrifice some of the symbolism around the fight to add emphasis to Naruto and Sasuke. \n\nI actually think that the War Arc had some great potential, but the way it was set up made it frustrating. It could have been had cool investigation/mystery beginning, followed by 3-4 significant fights against Tobi, Madara, and an incomplete Ten-Tails. Instead, we had \u201cI declare 4th Great Shinobi War\u201d, ninjas lining up in the open and abandoning all pretenses at stealth, and every named antagonist getting revived. \n\nKishi was understandably pretty burnt out by this point, considering the length of Shippuden and the insane schedules that manga authors have to deal with. It\u2019s not too surprising that the War Arc turned out the way it did, but it\u2019s fun to imagine what it could have been.",

But personally, everything could\u2019ve happened just as it did even if Guy had defeated Madara, I mean they still could have introduced Kaguya even through Madara\u2019s final dying moments after Guy\u2019s done with him. \n\nAnd god how i hate the whole Kaguya thing. It is also one of the major reasons why I hate Boruto ( this is personal and completely subjective). Not just because until now it\u2019s a bang average ( maybe below) show trying to survive off of Naruto\u2019s ( both the character and the show) goodwill, but its main plot point is also why the ending of the original show was ruined in the first place. \n\nIt\u2019s hard for me to imagine. Such a long story ( and a good one too) of than 500 chapters ruined just because they wanted a sequel no one needed. Man was already burnt out enough trying to end the original story, and then they make him go pull a sequel out of his ass. And pull he does, from Kaguya to everything that\u2019s happened in the Boruto manga, it has done nothing but ruin the original manga (except some fan service and closure moments which the anime canon gives which maybe good but overall completely unnecessary). \n\nAll of this is personal opinion, no intentions to hurt anyone.",

Where the original Naruto had strong themes of hard work, teamwork, and gradually getting stronger, Boruto has been... a mess. There were stabs at Boruto trying to step out of the shadow of his father, Sarada with much the same, but it's basically just become War Arc Pt. 3, with Akatsuki 2, Otsutsuki for days, but with sci-fi twists on the Naruto setting. Without core ideals, it's been coasting off of residual goodwill, and it's hard to see how it can stand on its own. \n\nUnfortunately, that's how the shonen manga industry works. There's this constant pressure for authors to keep producing, extending their works out way beyond their lifetime, and there's only so many times you can introduce New Antagonist #X without straining the reader's ability to suspend disbelief. Boruto was rushed into existence to ride the wave of Naruto's ending, and the result has been decidedly mediocre. \n\nEnding with Guy vs. Madara and one final Naruto vs. Sasuke fight would have been good enough, a fitting ending for one of the greatest shonen series of all time. Sadly, it never turned out that way.",

It actually appears in the story before Chidori (One Thousand Birds), when Kakashi uses it against Zabuza. The name \"Chidori\" only appears when Sasuke uses it against Gaara. \n\nMight Guy clarifies in Ch. 114 that Chidori is \"also known\" as Raikiri, but the hand signs demonstrated differ when they're shown. The names are often used interchangeably by other characters, which contributes to the confusion, but Sasuke only ever calls his versions \"Chidori\", and as far as I can tell, Kakashi only calls his Raikiri.",

The stakes are high which makes the conclusion so much more satisfying. \n\nI think this is why watching shikamaru is so satisfying. Since he will always be analytical, a major part of his fighting style is knowing his limits, hence they can\u2019t be ignored when writing the fight. This is unlike naruto who\u2019s powerlevel is much less defined and he is often the subject of \u201cdivine intervention\u201d rather than pure skill. Every time shikamaru duels someone you can tell he\u2019s using all of his abilities to achieve victory, without any sort of bullshit to save the day for him.",

Which is still stupid as Naruto shortly afterwards tells his dad that Sakura is his girlfriend, btw even Minato sees how much Sakura is like Kushina. \n\nLeaving out the shipping wars, it sucked to see Neji go out like that, he was actually interesting and was enjoyable to watch on screen. In contrast I can't ever seem to warm up to Hinita. She is just too boring, meek, and werid for me to like her. It would have been nice to see her actually sacrifice herself to save Naruto and Neji, as almost an inverse of Neji's dad sacrificing his life to save his brother's life, it would also shown that Hinita's love was a selfless love rather than just \"he cute and he must be mine\", rather than the selfish love we  got since she hated how Naruto was finally getting recognized by everyone else and getting some much deserved love from everyone.",

We don't really have the characters face consequences because of sensu beans, dragonballs, gods and angels helping them.",

The only one left with a reasonable card to play was Guy, and he needed to lose so that Naruto and Sasuke could step up to win. That\u2019s the decision Kishi made, to sacrifice some of the symbolism around the fight to add emphasis to Naruto and Sasuke. \n\nI actually think that the War Arc had some great potential, but the way it was set up made it frustrating. It could have been had cool investigation/mystery beginning, followed by 3-4 significant fights against Tobi, Madara, and an incomplete Ten-Tails. Instead, we had \u201cI declare 4th Great Shinobi War\u201d, ninjas lining up in the open and abandoning all pretenses at stealth, and every named antagonist getting revived. \n\nKishi was understandably pretty burnt out by this point, considering the length of Shippuden and the insane schedules that manga authors have to deal with. It\u2019s not too surprising that the War Arc turned out the way it did, but it\u2019s fun to imagine what it could have been.",

It is also one of the major reasons why I hate Boruto ( this is personal and completely subjective). Not just because until now it\u2019s a bang average ( maybe below) show trying to survive off of Naruto\u2019s ( both the character and the show) goodwill, but its main plot point is also why the ending of the original show was ruined in the first place. \n\nIt\u2019s hard for me to imagine. Such a long story ( and a good one too) of than 500 chapters ruined just because they wanted a sequel no one needed. Man was already burnt out enough trying to end the original story, and then they make him go pull a sequel out of his ass. And pull he does, from Kaguya to everything that\u2019s happened in the Boruto manga, it has done nothing but ruin the original manga (except some fan service and closure moments which the anime canon gives which maybe good but overall completely unnecessary). \n\nAll of this is personal opinion, no intentions to hurt anyone.",

Where the original Naruto had strong themes of hard work, teamwork, and gradually getting stronger, Boruto has been... a mess. There were stabs at Boruto trying to step out of the shadow of his father, Sarada with much the same, but it's basically just become War Arc Pt. 3, with Akatsuki 2, Otsutsuki for days, but with sci-fi twists on the Naruto setting. Without core ideals, it's been coasting off of residual goodwill, and it's hard to see how it can stand on its own. \n\nUnfortunately, that's how the shonen manga industry works. There's this constant pressure for authors to keep producing, extending their works out way beyond their lifetime, and there's only so many times you can introduce New Antagonist #X without straining the reader's ability to suspend disbelief. Boruto was rushed into existence to ride the wave of Naruto's ending, and the result has been decidedly mediocre. \n\nEnding with Guy vs. Madara and one final Naruto vs. Sasuke fight would have been good enough, a fitting ending for one of the greatest shonen series of all time.

It actually appears in the story before Chidori (One Thousand Birds), when Kakashi uses it against Zabuza. The name \"Chidori\" only appears when Sasuke uses it against Gaara. \n\nMight Guy clarifies in Ch. 114 that Chidori is \"also known\" as Raikiri, but the hand signs demonstrated differ when they're shown. The names are often used interchangeably by other characters, which contributes to the confusion, but Sasuke only ever calls his versions \"Chidori\", and as far as I can tell, Kakashi only calls his Raikiri.",

It just seemed like plot and that they were both \"destined\" to get tired at the same time just so they could seem evenly matched. Plus that fight happened not very long after they both just spent all day and night fighting Obito, the ten tails, madara, ten tails madara, and then kaguya, with no rests in between. If anything, that fight is the most limitless fight in the series.",

In contrast I can't ever seem to warm up to Hinita. She is just too boring, meek, and werid for me to like her. It would have been nice to see her actually sacrifice herself to save Naruto and Neji, as almost an inverse of Neji's dad sacrificing his life to save his brother's life, it would also shown that Hinita's love was a selfless love rather than just \"he cute and he must be mine\", rather than the selfish love we  got since she hated how Naruto was finally getting recognized by everyone else and getting some much deserved love from everyone.",

I mean Madara literally pulled a Buu when he healed from it. So why even bother might as well have ended it there. But, no the whole thing was going downhill the moment Pain ended, so why not run it completely into the ground.",

                    "body": "Well, Kishi\u2019s motivations for having Guy being unable to defeat Madara are at least understandable: he needed for someone we already know to lose, and Madara already bitchslapped Naruto / Sasuke and the 5 Kage. The only one left with a reasonable card to play was Guy, and he needed to lose so that Naruto and Sasuke could step up to win. That\u2019s the decision Kishi made, to sacrifice some of the symbolism around the fight to add emphasis to Naruto and Sasuke. \n\nI actually think that the War Arc had some great potential, but the way it was set up made it frustrating. It could have been had cool investigation/mystery beginning, followed by 3-4 significant fights against Tobi, Madara, and an incomplete Ten-Tails. Instead, we had \u201cI declare 4th Great Shinobi War\u201d, ninjas lining up in the open and abandoning all pretenses at stealth, and every named antagonist getting revived. \n\nKishi was understandably pretty burnt out by this point, considering the length of Shippuden and the insane schedules that manga authors have to deal with. It\u2019s not too surprising that the War Arc turned out the way it did, but it\u2019s fun to imagine what it could have been.",

But personally, everything could\u2019ve happened just as it did even if Guy had defeated Madara, I mean they still could have introduced Kaguya even through Madara\u2019s final dying moments after Guy\u2019s done with him. \n\nAnd god how i hate the whole Kaguya thing. It is also one of the major reasons why I hate Boruto ( this is personal and completely subjective). Not just because until now it\u2019s a bang average ( maybe below) show trying to survive off of Naruto\u2019s ( both the character and the show) goodwill, but its main plot point is also why the ending of the original show was ruined in the first place. \n\nIt\u2019s hard for me to imagine. Such a long story ( and a good one too) of than 500 chapters ruined just because they wanted a sequel no one needed. Man was already burnt out enough trying to end the original story, and then they make him go pull a sequel out of his ass. And pull he does, from Kaguya to everything that\u2019s happened in the Boruto manga, it has done nothing but ruin the original manga (except some fan service and closure moments which the anime canon gives which maybe good but overall completely unnecessary). \n\nAll of this is personal opinion, no intentions to hurt anyone.",

Where the original Naruto had strong themes of hard work, teamwork, and gradually getting stronger, Boruto has been... a mess. There were stabs at Boruto trying to step out of the shadow of his father, Sarada with much the same, but it's basically just become War Arc Pt. 3, with Akatsuki 2, Otsutsuki for days, but with sci-fi twists on the Naruto setting. Without core ideals, it's been coasting off of residual goodwill, and it's hard to see how it can stand on its own. \n\nUnfortunately, that's how the shonen manga industry works. There's this constant pressure for authors to keep producing, extending their works out way beyond their lifetime, and there's only so many times you can introduce New Antagonist #X without straining the reader's ability to suspend disbelief. Boruto was rushed into existence to ride the wave of Naruto's ending, and the result has been decidedly mediocre. \n\nEnding with Guy vs. Madara and one final Naruto vs. Sasuke fight would have been good enough, a fitting ending for one of the greatest shonen series of all time. Sadly, it never turned out that way.",

It actually appears in the story before Chidori (One Thousand Birds), when Kakashi uses it against Zabuza. The name \"Chidori\" only appears when Sasuke uses it against Gaara. \n\nMight Guy clarifies in Ch. 114 that Chidori is \"also known\" as Raikiri, but the hand signs demonstrated differ when they're shown. The names are often used interchangeably by other characters, which contributes to the confusion, but Sasuke only ever calls his versions \"Chidori\", and as far as I can tell, Kakashi only calls his Raikiri.",

Naruto's story of redemption and coming \"full circle\" ends with the Pain saga (which, with jiraya, is damn-near poetic). echoing some of the other guys here, but the scene where the village throws him up is like the perfect end scene.\n\nthe rest should've been sasuke's story, 100%, his whole redemption arc should've been something akin to naruto's resolve, such as killing tobi (before the BS war arc), and ending his cycle of hatred. again, similar, but different to naruto's story. they play up the parallelism within the two \"heroes\" of the show/manga towards the end with the whole sage of six paths and ashura/indra stuff, but doing this would've sufficed. honestly, it probably would've worked better, since most people, including myself, hate the whole \"destiny\" side of things that came to be.\n\nidk, the show, as a whole, was pretty consistent (by shonen standards i guess) with power scaling and such until the war arc, that's when even I felt the cheese ooze through.",

Which is still stupid as Naruto shortly afterwards tells his dad that Sakura is his girlfriend, btw even Minato sees how much Sakura is like Kushina. \n\nLeaving out the shipping wars, it sucked to see Neji go out like that, he was actually interesting and was enjoyable to watch on screen. In contrast I can't ever seem to warm up to Hinita. She is just too boring, meek, and werid for me to like her. It would have been nice to see her actually sacrifice herself to save Naruto and Neji, as almost an inverse of Neji's dad sacrificing his life to save his brother's life, it would also shown that Hinita's love was a selfless love rather than just \"he cute and he must be mine\", rather than the selfish love we  got since she hated how Naruto was finally getting recognized by everyone else and getting some much deserved love from everyone.",

The only one left with a reasonable card to play was Guy, and he needed to lose so that Naruto and Sasuke could step up to win. That\u2019s the decision Kishi made, to sacrifice some of the symbolism around the fight to add emphasis to Naruto and Sasuke. \n\nI actually think that the War Arc had some great potential, but the way it was set up made it frustrating. It could have been had cool investigation/mystery beginning, followed by 3-4 significant fights against Tobi, Madara, and an incomplete Ten-Tails. Instead, we had \u201cI declare 4th Great Shinobi War\u201d, ninjas lining up in the open and abandoning all pretenses at stealth, and every named antagonist getting revived. \n\nKishi was understandably pretty burnt out by this point, considering the length of Shippuden and the insane schedules that manga authors have to deal with. It\u2019s not too surprising that the War Arc turned out the way it did, but it\u2019s fun to imagine what it could have been.",

But personally, everything could\u2019ve happened just as it did even if Guy had defeated Madara, I mean they still could have introduced Kaguya even through Madara\u2019s final dying moments after Guy\u2019s done with him. \n\nAnd god how i hate the whole Kaguya thing. It is also one of the major reasons why I hate Boruto ( this is personal and completely subjective). Not just because until now it\u2019s a bang average ( maybe below) show trying to survive off of Naruto\u2019s ( both the character and the show) goodwill, but its main plot point is also why the ending of the original show was ruined in the first place. \n\nIt\u2019s hard for me to imagine. Such a long story ( and a good one too) of than 500 chapters ruined just because they wanted a sequel no one needed. Man was already burnt out enough trying to end the original story, and then they make him go pull a sequel out of his ass. And pull he does, from Kaguya to everything that\u2019s happened in the Boruto manga, it has done nothing but ruin the original manga (except some fan service and closure moments which the anime canon gives which maybe good but overall completely unnecessary). \n\nAll of this is personal opinion, no intentions to hurt anyone.",

Where the original Naruto had strong themes of hard work, teamwork, and gradually getting stronger, Boruto has been... a mess. There were stabs at Boruto trying to step out of the shadow of his father, Sarada with much the same, but it's basically just become War Arc Pt. 3, with Akatsuki 2, Otsutsuki for days, but with sci-fi twists on the Naruto setting. Without core ideals, it's been coasting off of residual goodwill, and it's hard to see how it can stand on its own. \n\nUnfortunately, that's how the shonen manga industry works. There's this constant pressure for authors to keep producing, extending their works out way beyond their lifetime, and there's only so many times you can introduce New Antagonist #X without straining the reader's ability to suspend disbelief. Boruto was rushed into existence to ride the wave of Naruto's ending, and the result has been decidedly mediocre. \n\nEnding with Guy vs. Madara and one final Naruto vs. Sasuke fight would have been good enough, a fitting ending for one of the greatest shonen series of all time. Sadly, it never turned out that way.",

It actually appears in the story before Chidori (One Thousand Birds), when Kakashi uses it against Zabuza. The name \"Chidori\" only appears when Sasuke uses it against Gaara. \n\nMight Guy clarifies in Ch. 114 that Chidori is \"also known\" as Raikiri, but the hand signs demonstrated differ when they're shown. The names are often used interchangeably by other characters, which contributes to the confusion, but Sasuke only ever calls his versions \"Chidori\", and as far as I can tell, Kakashi only calls his Raikiri.",

In contrast I can't ever seem to warm up to Hinita. She is just too boring, meek, and werid for me to like her. It would have been nice to see her actually sacrifice herself to save Naruto and Neji, as almost an inverse of Neji's dad sacrificing his life to save his brother's life, it would also shown that Hinita's love was a selfless love rather than just \"he cute and he must be mine\", rather than the selfish love we  got since she hated how Naruto was finally getting recognized by everyone else and getting some much deserved love from everyone.",

It is also one of the major reasons why I hate Boruto ( this is personal and completely subjective). Not just because until now it\u2019s a bang average ( maybe below) show trying to survive off of Naruto\u2019s ( both the character and the show) goodwill, but its main plot point is also why the ending of the original show was ruined in the first place. \n\nIt\u2019s hard for me to imagine. Such a long story ( and a good one too) of than 500 chapters ruined just because they wanted a sequel no one needed. Man was already burnt out enough trying to end the original story, and then they make him go pull a sequel out of his ass. And pull he does, from Kaguya to everything that\u2019s happened in the Boruto manga, it has done nothing but ruin the original manga (except some fan service and closure moments which the anime canon gives which maybe good but overall completely unnecessary). \n\nAll of this is personal opinion, no intentions to hurt anyone.",

There were stabs at Boruto trying to step out of the shadow of his father, Sarada with much the same, but it's basically just become War Arc Pt. 3, with Akatsuki 2, Otsutsuki for days, but with sci-fi twists on the Naruto setting. Without core ideals, it's been coasting off of residual goodwill, and it's hard to see how it can stand on its own. \n\nUnfortunately, that's how the shonen manga industry works. There's this constant pressure for authors to keep producing, extending their works out way beyond their lifetime, and there's only so many times you can introduce New Antagonist #X without straining the reader's ability to suspend disbelief. Boruto was rushed into existence to ride the wave of Naruto's ending, and the result has been decidedly mediocre. \n\nEnding with Guy vs. Madara and one final Naruto vs. Sasuke fight would have been good enough, a fitting ending for one of the greatest shonen series of all time. Sadly, it never turned out that way.",

It actually appears in the story before Chidori (One Thousand Birds), when Kakashi uses it against Zabuza. The name \"Chidori\" only appears when Sasuke uses it against Gaara. \n\nMight Guy clarifies in Ch. 114 that Chidori is \"also known\" as Raikiri, but the hand signs demonstrated differ when they're shown. The names are often used interchangeably by other characters, which contributes to the confusion, but Sasuke only ever calls his versions \"Chidori\", and as far as I can tell, Kakashi only calls his Raikiri.",

There were stabs at Boruto trying to step out of the shadow of his father, Sarada with much the same, but it's basically just become War Arc Pt. 3, with Akatsuki 2, Otsutsuki for days, but with sci-fi twists on the Naruto setting. Without core ideals, it's been coasting off of residual goodwill, and it's hard to see how it can stand on its own. \n\nUnfortunately, that's how the shonen manga industry works. There's this constant pressure for authors to keep producing, extending their works out way beyond their lifetime, and there's only so many times you can introduce New Antagonist #X without straining the reader's ability to suspend disbelief. Boruto was rushed into existence to ride the wave of Naruto's ending, and the result has been decidedly mediocre. \n\nEnding with Guy vs. Madara and one final Naruto vs. Sasuke fight would have been good enough, a fitting ending for one of the greatest shonen series of all time. Sadly, it never turned out that way.",

The name \"Chidori\" only appears when Sasuke uses it against Gaara. \n\nMight Guy clarifies in Ch. 114 that Chidori is \"also known\" as Raikiri, but the hand signs demonstrated differ when they're shown. The names are often used interchangeably by other characters, which contributes to the confusion, but Sasuke only ever calls his versions \"Chidori\", and as far as I can tell, Kakashi only calls his Raikiri.",
