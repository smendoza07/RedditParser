    "body": "I had SB tell me tonight that even after our SR is over she wants me in her life.  Wants me at her future wedding.   Wants me to know her kids.  And so on.  I was literally speechless, but also flattered.  She also told me exactly when she realized this.  It was our third trip together about 8 months ago.   I have always felt that particular trip was an escalation point for us, because she went into a different gear, with the affection she showed.  And tonight for whatever reason, she felt it necessary to tell me.  Likely because she needed someone to listen to her about the life challenges that Covid has brought to her, which went on before she said this to me.  \n\nBefore anyone gets the wrong idea, we can never have anything but an arrangement, especially with a 40+ year age gap.   I am married with an ill wife and that is never changing, and sometime in the next year or two, SB will likely be into a vanilla relationship potentially leading to marriage.  On the other hand, there is no impending end to the SR either.  We will have a separation for a while due to Covid, but we expect to successfully navigate that challenge.   \n\nI am not sure why I am posting this.  Likely because I cannot tell anyone IRL.  Guess I am also kind of wondering if others have gone through this.  I remain stunned a few hours after the conversation.",
