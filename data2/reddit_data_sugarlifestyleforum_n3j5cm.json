    "body": "TJMaxx has almost everything, and some of the brands are pretty acceptable (Polo RL, Coach, MK, Kate Spade, Lauren RL, etc.). Also, I\u2019m not anywhere near the shopping that a place like LA, NYC, Chicago or even Atlanta or WPB would provide, so a TJMaxx tends to compete with the same brands as the nicest department stores in my area.\n\nWith that background to hopefully avoid being judged as cheap, after a M&G if things went well, I enjoy suggesting shopping at a TJMaxx to keep the date going. We then play some variation of 20 questions to help me figure out what I\u2019m going to get for her. The rules are after the last question is asked, I have to make the decision without any more feedback from her. It\u2019s generally playful, allows for a bit of flirting and shoulder brushes/physical closeness and really puts a good gauge on chemistry in addition to showing you\u2019re willing to invest time to get to know about her. \n\nAlso, between their handbags, luggage, clothing, jewelry and unique cuisine options (one time I built an Italian food \u201cbasket\u201d with a pasta pot because that fit what the answers led to, and she loved it); normally you can find a nice 50-150 item(s) to get that the POT SB will like/use. Aside from the SDs that absolutely cannot stand going shopping, it is a great chance to spend 30-60 minutes learning about her favorite color, favorite precious metal, favorite body care scent, etc. If the shopping trip isn\u2019t that enjoyable of a time, a SR probably isn\u2019t going to be that great either.\n\nAnd to make sure it is clear, it isn\u2019t a test for the SB, it is a test for chemistry. It is also the only place anywhere close that sells the name brands listed above, so it is a \u201cgreat\u201d option considering the local options. Best wishes to all, thank you for coming to my dread talk and stay well!",

            "body": "Like some other SBs I feel rather conflicted about this approach. Initially I want to balk at the idea of this - a M&G is just as much about the SB sizing you up as you are her - how is taking her to an off-price discount store going to impress her or incentivize her to want to continue with a relationship with you?\n\nPurely from my perspective currently living in a major metropolitan area (but having come from the Midwest) I would take this suggestion to continue our M&G at a TJMaxx as a either a joke in poor taste or immediately assume he is broke and cannot actually afford to sugar date, which would immediately put an end to the M&G no matter how great it was going up until that point. (Not to mention stores like TJ Maxx are typically not well-kept and being in a dirty, disorganized store is not my idea of a fun time during a M&G; on my own time I\u2019m happy to find a hidden gem of a deal between the office supplies and the seasonal decor, but during a M&G? No thanks.)\n\nThe POT would be better off not saying anything about TJMaxx or taking me shopping (not to mention getting into a car with a POT you just met is rather unsafe). If the POT really wanted to show his appreciation at the end of a M&G the most I would expect is a small cash gift, not an invitation to go shopping, even if it was for a designer something.\n\nNow the idea of a little 20 questions style date with a gift at the end is super cute! Maybe this could work better as a one-off platonic date after the M&G on a different date where you agree to meet at a somewhat nicer location (like if she already said something about home decor during the M&G, ask her to meet at a Pottery Barn, if she said something about cooking, baking or enjoying being in the kitchen, take her to a Williams Sonoma, said she likes gaming or photography, take her to an electronics store- there are lots of options outside of department stores that you may consider that would still be a better option than TJ Maxx).",

What\u2019s her favorite body care scent, color, precious metal, handbag type, precious/semi-precious stone, etc. Knowing that allows me to get random things to pair with the PPM/allowance down the road and make it seem/feel less transactional. Who gives a prostitute a bottle of bubble bath in their favorite scent or an anklet made with gold/rose gold/white gold with a birthstone charm based on favorite precious metal? For me and for the people I\u2019ve sugar dated, it\u2019s a nice little extra that elevates the experience.

I bought a $2500 sport coat for $250 cause it was so much it didn't move and kept getting marked down.  Started at 1250 and no takers.  So if its an area with high income dont be afraid to step in to the affordable store you can find some amazing things.",

There's a shoe store in my home town that utterly delights me. Their selection is totally random, but OMG the deals. I mostly wear boots and I have bought multiple pairs of Frye brand boots for $89.\n\nAnd over the years I have learned that I don't mesh well with SBs who are expecting a luxury experience. Fortunately, my location is a mid-sized college city in the south and the vast majority of pot SBs are looking for help with living expenses , tuition or student loan help. So they are happy with my above average (for my area) allowance with occasional  extras like trips. And they almost always are down for bargain shopping which is so much fun.",

It may be Broadway tickets or shopping or museum admission or Dave & Busters play card cost; but in addition to meal costs and allowance gifting, I am spending money on \u201cdating\u201d activities. \n\nThat\u2019s how I feel a sugar arrangement should be. Sugar dating is dating, but with sugar. A strict budget takes the fun out of it. As a real SD, it shouldn\u2019t matter if I spend twenty on museum admission or three benjis on show tickets or a couple benjis on a bit of shopping or fly her out to a beach resort for the weekend and drop a couple/few grand.

Even though you repeatedly said it's the best alternative around, they just could not wrap their minds around it.\n\nI think that what you are doing here is great for many reasons:\n\n1. It's a pressure-free way to get to know more about each other.  You could learn much more about each other in an hour doing this than you could ever learn in an hour sitting and talking in a restaurant.\n2. The SB should be able to have a lot of fun with this, and if not, then you will know that she is not for you.\n3. You should be able to identify how driven by money the woman is.\n4. This provides a shared experience that should put each of you much more at ease the next time you meet.\n5. The SB will have a gift that you picked out for her with her guidance.  The gift and the experience will be something that she can think about before the next meeting, and also as long as the relationship lasts.\n\nReading the responses was interesting.  Your post was like an inkblot test.  Some people saw kittens, and some people saw dragons.  I think that the people who saw dragons see a lot of dragons everywhere they go.  They are the ones who are missing out on a lot of the pleasures of life.  This is truly one of the most outstanding posts I have ever seen on any forum.",

So, there was a lot more in her eyes than the money once things got underway.\n\nThere is no imposition for physical contact in what I shared. If we are a foot apart and I move eight inches towards her and she moves four inches towards me and our shoulders touch; that isn\u2019t imposition, that\u2019s chemistry. I may be taking the lead a bit, but it isn\u2019t imposition - it isn\u2019t forced at all. I read her body language and act accordingly and with respect and reserve.

You have the power to demand respect and next if respect is not shown. You have the power to communicate your needs and next if they will not be met (not only financial needs but also mental, social and emotional). You have the power to insist upon meeting in public and not be forced to meet at a hotel first. You have the power to leave whenever you please. You have the power to insist upon a platonic first meet (you should next the pot if you\u2019re having to insist upon it). You have the power to seek a quality sugar mentor of an experienced SB that can help you navigate the bowl. You have the power to say \u201cno.\u201d You have the power to keep you legs closed. To all aspiring and current SBs, don\u2019t fall for the B.S. that you have no power. You do, and anyone that treats you like you don\u2019t or attempts to brainwash you into thinking you don\u2019t deserves to have their input and thoughts ignored. \n\nAny healthy relationship is about give and take. If the SD had ALL the power, there would be no need to have different allowances or to work to differentiate oneself as a better SD option than others. Sugar dating shifts the power from being the 95/5 split that normal dating has to probably a 40/60 to 20/80 split in favor of the sugar parent. But that does not mean ALL power rests with the SD. \n\nThe M&G is a two-way interview to see if there is compatibility to start an arrangement. I never commit to paying for one and next those with low level thinking that insist upon it, but I also always gift a small amount of cash to show I appreciate the SB and to show I will gift beyond commitment. It allows me to avoid rinser/scammers/idiots who believe what they see online and to meet quality and understanding pots that I tend to click with. I could have had a lot more M&Gs, but they would have been with lower caliber and generally conceited individuals and would not have led to a SR.",

Sugar dating is dating, but with sugar. A strict budget takes the fun out of it. As a real SD, it shouldn\u2019t matter if I spend twenty on museum admission or three benjis on show tickets or a couple benjis on a bit of shopping or fly her out to a beach resort for the weekend and drop a couple/few grand.

You have the power to demand respect and next if respect is not shown. You have the power to communicate your needs and next if they will not be met (not only financial needs but also mental, social and emotional). You have the power to insist upon meeting in public and not be forced to meet at a hotel first. You have the power to leave whenever you please. You have the power to insist upon a platonic first meet (you should next the pot if you\u2019re having to insist upon it). You have the power to seek a quality sugar mentor of an experienced SB that can help you navigate the bowl. You have the power to say \u201cno.\u201d You have the power to keep you legs closed. To all aspiring and current SBs, don\u2019t fall for the B.S. that you have no power. You do, and anyone that treats you like you don\u2019t or attempts to brainwash you into thinking you don\u2019t deserves to have their input and thoughts ignored. \n\nAny healthy relationship is about give and take. If the SD had ALL the power, there would be no need to have different allowances or to work to differentiate oneself as a better SD option than others. Sugar dating shifts the power from being the 95/5 split that normal dating has to probably a 40/60 to 20/80 split in favor of the sugar parent. But that does not mean ALL power rests with the SD. \n\nThe M&G is a two-way interview to see if there is compatibility to start an arrangement. I never commit to paying for one and next those with low level thinking that insist upon it, but I also always gift a small amount of cash to show I appreciate the SB and to show I will gift beyond commitment. It allows me to avoid rinser/scammers/idiots who believe what they see online and to meet quality and understanding pots that I tend to click with. I could have had a lot more M&Gs, but they would have been with lower caliber and generally conceited individuals and would not have led to a SR.",

You have the power to demand respect and next if respect is not shown. You have the power to communicate your needs and next if they will not be met (not only financial needs but also mental, social and emotional). You have the power to insist upon meeting in public and not be forced to meet at a hotel first. You have the power to leave whenever you please. You have the power to insist upon a platonic first meet (you should next the pot if you\u2019re having to insist upon it). You have the power to seek a quality sugar mentor of an experienced SB that can help you navigate the bowl. You have the power to say \u201cno.\u201d You have the power to keep you legs closed. To all aspiring and current SBs, don\u2019t fall for the B.S. that you have no power. You do, and anyone that treats you like you don\u2019t or attempts to brainwash you into thinking you don\u2019t deserves to have their input and thoughts ignored. \n\nAny healthy relationship is about give and take. If the SD had ALL the power, there would be no need to have different allowances or to work to differentiate oneself as a better SD option than others. Sugar dating shifts the power from being the 95/5 split that normal dating has to probably a 40/60 to 20/80 split in favor of the sugar parent. But that does not mean ALL power rests with the SD. \n\nThe M&G is a two-way interview to see if there is compatibility to start an arrangement. I never commit to paying for one and next those with low level thinking that insist upon it, but I also always gift a small amount of cash to show I appreciate the SB and to show I will gift beyond commitment. It allows me to avoid rinser/scammers/idiots who believe what they see online and to meet quality and understanding pots that I tend to click with. I could have had a lot more M&Gs, but they would have been with lower caliber and generally conceited individuals and would not have led to a SR.",

Completely understand the money matters, and it is what opens the door. I\u2019ve ended multiple SRs that were getting too clingy and been countered with switching to vanilla dating by the POT. So, there was a lot more in her eyes than the money once things got underway.\n\nThere is no imposition for physical contact in what I shared. If we are a foot apart and I move eight inches towards her and she moves four inches towards me and our shoulders touch; that isn\u2019t imposition, that\u2019s chemistry. I may be taking the lead a bit, but it isn\u2019t imposition - it isn\u2019t forced at all. I read her body language and act accordingly and with respect and reserve. My post is far from grandstanding. The last time I took a pot to TJM, her hands we\u2019re definitely on me more than mine were beginning to come close to her.\n\nAnd demanding payment for the M&G isn\u2019t a way to make sure you get sugar, it\u2019s a way to drive off the kindest and most generous ones who have been burned in the past with the scammers that collect for a M&G and then ghost.",
