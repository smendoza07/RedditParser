Both were average looking to below average. Honestly I disliked them because to me they were super unlikeable, but they were extremely confident and extroverted to the point where they ran their friend group. They both dated two really hot girls from our college that a lot of guys liked. Confidence really is super important and just talking to people a lot will help. I\u2019m not saying that being attractive means nothing lol like obviously what you look like matters, but the average guy or below average can get a girlfriend with confidence and being assertive. Charisma is a thing and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s plenty of people you\u2019ve met where some reason they are just likeable regardless of what they look like. Whether they are cool to talk to or fun to be around. Just look around in public and you\u2019ll see plenty of below average- average guys with girlfriends.",

He wears hats all the time but is considering just shaving it. \nIt's very freeing to not hide it.",

Both were average looking to below average. Honestly I disliked them because to me they were super unlikeable, but they were extremely confident and extroverted to the point where they ran their friend group. They both dated two really hot girls from our college that a lot of guys liked. Confidence really is super important and just talking to people a lot will help. I\u2019m not saying that being attractive means nothing lol like obviously what you look like matters, but the average guy or below average can get a girlfriend with confidence and being assertive. Charisma is a thing and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s plenty of people you\u2019ve met where some reason they are just likeable regardless of what they look like. Whether they are cool to talk to or fun to be around. Just look around in public and you\u2019ll see plenty of below average- average guys with girlfriends.",

Both were average looking to below average. Honestly I disliked them because to me they were super unlikeable, but they were extremely confident and extroverted to the point where they ran their friend group. They both dated two really hot girls from our college that a lot of guys liked. Confidence really is super important and just talking to people a lot will help. I\u2019m not saying that being attractive means nothing lol like obviously what you look like matters, but the average guy or below average can get a girlfriend with confidence and being assertive. Charisma is a thing and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s plenty of people you\u2019ve met where some reason they are just likeable regardless of what they look like. Whether they are cool to talk to or fun to be around. Just look around in public and you\u2019ll see plenty of below average- average guys with girlfriends.",

Both were average looking to below average. Honestly I disliked them because to me they were super unlikeable, but they were extremely confident and extroverted to the point where they ran their friend group. They both dated two really hot girls from our college that a lot of guys liked. Confidence really is super important and just talking to people a lot will help. I\u2019m not saying that being attractive means nothing lol like obviously what you look like matters, but the average guy or below average can get a girlfriend with confidence and being assertive. Charisma is a thing and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s plenty of people you\u2019ve met where some reason they are just likeable regardless of what they look like. Whether they are cool to talk to or fun to be around. Just look around in public and you\u2019ll see plenty of below average- average guys with girlfriends.",

Honestly I disliked them because to me they were super unlikeable, but they were extremely confident and extroverted to the point where they ran their friend group. They both dated two really hot girls from our college that a lot of guys liked. Confidence really is super important and just talking to people a lot will help. I\u2019m not saying that being attractive means nothing lol like obviously what you look like matters, but the average guy or below average can get a girlfriend with confidence and being assertive. Charisma is a thing and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s plenty of people you\u2019ve met where some reason they are just likeable regardless of what they look like. Whether they are cool to talk to or fun to be around. Just look around in public and you\u2019ll see plenty of below average- average guys with girlfriends.",

Honestly I disliked them because to me they were super unlikeable, but they were extremely confident and extroverted to the point where they ran their friend group. They both dated two really hot girls from our college that a lot of guys liked. Confidence really is super important and just talking to people a lot will help. I\u2019m not saying that being attractive means nothing lol like obviously what you look like matters, but the average guy or below average can get a girlfriend with confidence and being assertive. Charisma is a thing and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s plenty of people you\u2019ve met where some reason they are just likeable regardless of what they look like. Whether they are cool to talk to or fun to be around. Just look around in public and you\u2019ll see plenty of below average- average guys with girlfriends.",

Honestly I disliked them because to me they were super unlikeable, but they were extremely confident and extroverted to the point where they ran their friend group. They both dated two really hot girls from our college that a lot of guys liked. Confidence really is super important and just talking to people a lot will help. I\u2019m not saying that being attractive means nothing lol like obviously what you look like matters, but the average guy or below average can get a girlfriend with confidence and being assertive. Charisma is a thing and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s plenty of people you\u2019ve met where some reason they are just likeable regardless of what they look like. Whether they are cool to talk to or fun to be around. Just look around in public and you\u2019ll see plenty of below average- average guys with girlfriends.",

Honestly I disliked them because to me they were super unlikeable, but they were extremely confident and extroverted to the point where they ran their friend group. They both dated two really hot girls from our college that a lot of guys liked. Confidence really is super important and just talking to people a lot will help. I\u2019m not saying that being attractive means nothing lol like obviously what you look like matters, but the average guy or below average can get a girlfriend with confidence and being assertive. Charisma is a thing and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s plenty of people you\u2019ve met where some reason they are just likeable regardless of what they look like. Whether they are cool to talk to or fun to be around. Just look around in public and you\u2019ll see plenty of below average- average guys with girlfriends.",
