    "body": "Some observations\n\nI have been in the sugar life for 9 years now, took a break during covid with all the hotels and restaurants being closed here (on and off)\n\nJust rejoined SA last week, surprised with the amount of SB on there (almost double)\n\nFind arrangements average price up about 25 percent\n\nFind SBs are much easily open to meeting and fast\n\nApparently many sugar free SDs on the site who just want to message the woman and say due to covid they can't meet.\n\nOverall, seems like the sugar life is seeing some trying times, so all you SDs out there who aren't hurting, you should definitely help support a second and or third SB. It's the time of giving :)",
