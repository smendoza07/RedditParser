And her natural beauty is widely known and so she was asked to downplay it. \nThere was also a chatty episode a while back where she said when they played water games, she always took the longest to wash up and reapply makeup etc. She felt bad making everyone wait so she just stopped fussing too much about looking perfect. \n\nI think over the years, she just became comfortable with being barefaced and casual. Which is what I feel a lot of people relate to and what has kept her relevant all these years.",
