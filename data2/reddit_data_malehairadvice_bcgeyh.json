My 2 cents is that it\u2019s coming up on summer so might as well use that as an excuse to go short. You wouldn\u2019t have to go extreme but could if you wished. Maybe a low fade with 3/4\u201d roughly on top. Maybe a bit extra toward the front. Again, hard to go wrong with your features. Find a highly rated barber in the area and sit down and tel him you\u2019re looking for change and ask his opinion. He\u2019ll get you set in the right direction for sure.",
