    "body": "So I was just trying to enjoy my peach bellini.  The hotel had a hot tub on its balcony, and I am sitting with my SB, looking out at Redondo Beach.  It was all totally relaxing until she steered the conversation to fashion crimes.  I threw out the ole \"I was a breech baby, so for a little while in time, I wore my mom as a hat.\"\n#\nSee, this is why I try not to date doctors and nurses.  Instead of just taking the joke, my future surgeon SB gets upset.  \"What? Why didn't they do <insert medical jargon here>.\"  My girl is going ham on these 70's era doctors.  She is treating it like her own personal festivus, where she lists all of her grievances toward them, and of course, how she would have handled my delivery (much better).  I am just trying to crawl inside my bellini.  \n#\nThen, all of the sudden, the blame hurricane comes my way.  \"Why couldn't they turn you around?\"  She asks, glaring at me angrily.  Whoa!  Hold on now. I wasn't planning on being the fetal Kool-aid man.  My mom was surely a barrier to refreshment growing up, but it would have been easier to break into her wine fridge, than out of her junk.  I said:  \"Babe, I wasn't in charge of my birth.  If I was, I would have ordered a martini and some porn.  That way, I would have come into this world, the same way I am going to go out:  Drunk, naked, rock hard, and making my mom SCREAM.\"  Then I jumped up, and did a little dance (still in the tub, mind you) to help make sure she didn't miss the joke this time.  If you are picturing a six foot french fry doing the Carlton, you have the right idea.\n#\nTo my surprise, she says:  \"You are so adorable.\"  Huh.  Turns out you don't even need hair or hips to send your girl's panties on an intergalactic voyage.  You just need to make sure your dick jokes are choreographed to the sensuous dance of my people (nerds).  \n#\nWell boys, this brings the total number of lifetime compliments I have received on my looks, all the way up to two.  That's a 100% increase in the month of December alone.  Interestingly, the first compliment I ever got from a girl was also a drunk SB. She happened to be looking at the bartender at the time, and accidentally used his name instead of mine, but eh.... close enough.\n#\nAnyway, at this rate I am pleased to announce that I will be an international sex symbol by this summer.  When you folks drive around and see me on every billboard, you can be like \"Him?  Oh, I knew ole noodly arms back when he was only famous for drinking excessive amounts of pineapple juice.\"  God, I can't wait to tell my mom when I finally have more onlyfans subscribers than my sister. Sorry, *sniff,* to get sentimental on you guys, but I think mom is finally gonna be proud of her little vaginal wrecking ball.",
