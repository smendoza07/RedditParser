Yelling through the closed door: \u201cThis thing has a fucking heated seat - are you fucking kidding me?!\u201d\n\n2. \u201cWhen I build my own house, I am getting one!!\u201d\n\n3. On the second trip in comes out incredulous about the nozzles and how they are the best things ever\n\n4. Third trip - \u201cyou never told me there was a dryer - holy shit!!\u201d\n\nThe thing about young women that can be so fun and charming is their enthusiasm for new stuff.",

The floor warmers? \n\nIt truly depends on the individual systems used (there\u2019s several). How they are manufactured and their individual output determines exactly what level of LEED certification they qualify for towards the total rating. \n\nAs far as floor warming technology, the only points you are likely to obtain would be in \u201cenergy and atmosphere\u201d and possibly \u201cindoor environmental quality\u201d categories (although this will likely have fewer potential qualifying points) for LEED certification.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s not a yes or no answer",

This was the second time I was at his house, the first time I didn\u2019t use the main bathroom. I had to tinkle and I discovered he had a Japanese high-tech bidet toilet. Anyways, I was freaking out cause I thought it was so cool and has so many options. \n\nThe water was perfectly warm and squired up intensely right on my clit. I moaned really loud unexpectedly. SD rushed over to make sure everything was okay. And I said yeah, Japanese bidet feels so good I could have an orgasm. He opened the door and said go right ahead and sat down leaning against the cabinet facing directly towards me. I think I came from the bidet in about 5 minutes.\n\nIt was amazing.Unfortunately, the SD wasn\u2019t and didn\u2019t see him much after that. One day, I\u2019m gonna buy a Japanese Bidet.",

How they are manufactured and their individual output determines exactly what level of LEED certification they qualify for towards the total rating. \n\nAs far as floor warming technology, the only points you are likely to obtain would be in \u201cenergy and atmosphere\u201d and possibly \u201cindoor environmental quality\u201d categories (although this will likely have fewer potential qualifying points) for LEED certification.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s not a yes or no answer",
