    "body": "So I found what I thought was a great match on Seeking and we have a good chat. She's in grad school with an amazing figure and a warm personality.  We move it over to text and talk for a few days, agree on a reasonable ppm and set up a M&G. We exchange some innocent pictures over text and I'm like \ud83d\ude0d.  The day of she tells me she might have had possible Covid-19 exposure so we postpone to the following day (assuming she tested negative) \n\nI check in with her today and everything is good to go and we agree to meet at a nice Spanish wine and tapas bar.  She texts me and says is it just lunch or are we doing anything afterwards.  Big head wins (thx SLF) and says nah, just lunch and if it goes well we'll schedule something for early next week.  She gets here and I get up to give her a hug and I'm like I've really lucked out.\n\nSo we sit down and I ask if everyone turned out negative that she lived with and I also asked if she had her booster yet... And she was like I'm not vaccinated \ud83d\ude02. Then went into how clinical trials are \"sponsored\" and not partial and just believes in personal choice. In my profile I mentioned how I'm vaccinated and have my booster.  Then she asks will that be a problem and doesn't want to be judged.  Battle ensues again between big head and little head and I'm like it probably will and she leaves before we order a thing.  At least I got to enjoy some seared tuna and grilled octopus.... alone\n\nMoral of the story is if vaccination status is important don't leave it up to the other person to ask or read your profile. Just because you talk about Covid also doesn't mean it will occur to the other person to disclose they're not vaccinated.  Feel stupid for assuming it but I live in a metropolitan area with a high vaccination rate so I just took it for granted.  I've had a few conversations with people on SA and they've made it clear that they don't plan on getting the vaccine and it's been easy to hit next. As many have mentioned before here...always look to improve your vetting process so you don't waste your time. How many of you all out there explicitly ask about vaccination status?",

Throw in Civil Asset Forfeiture, Qualified Immunity,  protection of criminal cops, Judges whose campaigns are paid for by prosecuting DAs, minorities going to jail at twice the numbers than whites for the same crimes etc etc etc... the whole Fascist system is corrupt and the only ones who want to fix it are NOT  Republicans.    \n\nNot sure what the New York DA is thinking but it doesn't allow you to credibly make blanket statements about all \"DAs in most the big cities.\"     So many peoples lives have been ruined by stupid little crimes of no consequence.   We need to start looking at crime in a different way instead of draconian punishment that permanently makes people pariahs for life, unable to get educated, kept from housing, unable to vote, unable to be gainfully employed.....for a crime that they already went to jail for.    All we are doing is creating more criminals.  \n\nTHe Federal Government doesn't control state DAs so your point is moot anyway.   The idea that you would hold Trump up as a symbol of \"law and order\" is borderline insane.   Trump who pardoned people who committed crimes for him,who pardoned war criminal murderers, who is corrupt to the bone...if I listed his confirm-able crimes I would  be typing for the rest of my life.",

The fact that you think our system is fascist is quite telling. The vast majority of cops are good. Like all humans there are some bad ones. They need to be rooted out and bodycam is a great tool for this. I notice you don't go after teachers but you must be aware that black american test scores are terrible compared to every other group so the teachers must also be racist fascist right? Keep making heros out of George Floyd,only in a completely broken community would a man who broken into a pregnant woman's home and put a gun to her belly would that be possible.",

George Soros made a shit ton of money in one of the greatest trade deals in history, I believe it had something to do with the shorting the British pound or something,  Anyway, Rupert Murdoch lost a lot of money on the trade and in retaliation he set his media empire to smear Soros and paint him to be some sort of puppet master controlling left wing politics.   THe Soros right wing mythology is nothing more than a 20 year personal vendetta.   \n  Completely ridiculous when seen with the facts.   Also anti-semitic.   \n\nCrime needs to be fought with economic and social equality.   Change the root of crime instead of just punishing people for committing them.     \n\nA good cop who protects or ignores a bad cop is also a bad cop.  I would add they are worse because of their cowardice.     Do you know what happens to the career of a good cop that 'rats' out a bad cop?  Pretty much ends it.

However, the vaccine continues to be effective at preventing serious disease.  Of course, in the most vulnerable populations, vaxxed or not, they're at maximum risk, so it makes a lot of sense to reduce your chances of spreading it to them.\n\nBesides spreading it to people at high risk, another good reason to not want to get covid, is because 25%-50% of people with it get \"long covid\", which appears to be an auto-immune disease kicked off by the immune system's response to covid.  Some people with long covid have serious disease, we don't know how long it will last.  New evidence in the past few weeks is that even people with asymptomatic covid (they were infected but never got sick so it never progressed to disease) are getting long covid, just like people who felt sick or were hospitalized.\n\nLastly, personal-experience wise, people who are not vaccinated, are also the most likely to live the high-risk (covid-wise) lifestyle.  Even if vaccines aren't perfect against infection or disease, if you're trying to avoid passing it to others or getting long covid autoimmune disease, best to avoid those at highest risk of having covid -- even if you don't get very sick, killing your grandma or getting long covid are less likely.\n\nNo reason to be insulted by all this.  It isn't personal -- it's just a bunch of rational and risk-management choices.",

Yes, the vaccine prevents a serious case of covid, but most SB\u2019s are at the age and health where they\u2019re super low risk anyway.\n\nRight, current vaccines aren't as efficient at preventing infection with omicron, but they're still efficient at preventing serious disease.  But even though SB is young and  healthy:\n\n1. If she's infected, she has just as much probability of developing long covid as anyone else, even if the infection doesn't progress to disease.  \"I didn't get covid, but did get a long-term autoimmune disease\" is not a win.\n2. If she's infected, she can pass it on to her grammy, who is still at serious risk.  \"I didn't get covid, but did kill my grammy\" is not a win.\n\nSo it's a rational choice to reduce contact with people likely to give you covid, and IME, unvaccinated people are the most likely to live a high-risk lifestyle.  They're the first ones to cut contact with.  Along with other lifestyle changes, you can reduce (but not remove) the risk\n\n\\*\\*\\* do note the vaccine is STILL somewhat (if less) effective at preventing infection, I haven't seen anything suggesting it's 0% effective against infection with omicron.  Given the same exposure, your vaccinated friend is still a bit less likely to get infected, and that's something",

Maybe because they care about the well beings of others around them? Not only that, but there are studies still being done on the long term effects of Covid, so why risk that at all? I\u2019m not holed up in my home, but being vaccinated requires the minimal of efforts, so I expect that from others especially if I\u2019m going to be spending my free time with them.",

Could I still get Covid from someone vaccinated? Absolutely, but in my experience, these people are more mindful and do more in their minimization of acquiring Covid by wearing mask or quarantining when necessary. \n2) I\u2019m in the medical field. I\u2019m personally frustrated seeing people who are unvaccinated and hospitalized knowing that this could have been avoidable for them. \n3) Extra salty at the existence of Omicron which could have been avoided had more people been vaccinated which would minimize the chance of the virus mutating.",

The vaccines exist to prevent Covid but in the event you do get Covid, it will be a milder course and can prevent hospitalization. Being vaccinated and having a booster is significantly much better than being unvaccinated when having Omicron. Look at the patient population that is hospitalized. Majority of them are unvaccinated. Having people vaccinated can prevent future variants, so it shows to me someone\u2019s value when they choose to be unvaccinated. Unless you have a severe reaction or have some health condition preventing you from getting a vaccine, I don\u2019t care enough to associate with you, and I thank OP for reminding me as I too assumed most people are vaccinated. Not only that, but if someone decides against the vaccination, then I recommend they 100% commit to this by refusing any vaccination including the flu shot or Tdap should they step on a rusty nail. Why not live and die by your convictions?",

I've known people who have been boosterized and have gotten Corona. \nI respect peoples' decisions to do what they want with their own bodies. If getting vaccinated is what you want to do to make sure you are less at risk / more healthy, go for it. If you have moral / religious qualms about getting vaxxed, or just don't feel like it, that's fine too, you know the risks. What I hate is the politicizing of the issue and people feeling morally superior over others, for whatever their choice may be, and trying to shame the others (specifically vaxxed shaming unvaxxed). Their body, their choice. Clearly vaccines and boosters aren't a cure-all, they may help prevent it, but they do not cure it. And it would seem more people that have been vaccinated are getting Omicron vs. unvaccinated, which is kind of odd...\nIn other words, I don't like people who try to force their opinions or shame people.",

We can probably take some best practices from STD status/etc and apply them here, including approaches for when you don't care as much what the other person's approach/status is.\n\nPer your question I do ask about vaccination status and general COVID safety/approach, because I'm looking for someone whose views on this topic align with mine.

Keeping people in jail because they are too poor to make bail is an antiquated and corrupt practice.   In our justice system, less than 6% of all criminal cases go to trial because the system is designed to make you plead guilty even if you are innocent.   Prisons have been built by private companies across the country on the guarantee that their beds be filled.    The system is designed to make criminals out of everyday people.      Throw in Civil Asset Forfeiture, Qualified Immunity,  protection of criminal cops, Judges whose campaigns are paid for by prosecuting DAs, minorities going to jail at twice the numbers than whites for the same crimes etc etc etc... the whole Fascist system is corrupt and the only ones who want to fix it are NOT  Republicans.    \n\nNot sure what the New York DA is thinking but it doesn't allow you to credibly make blanket statements about all \"DAs in most the big cities.\"     So many peoples lives have been ruined by stupid little crimes of no consequence.   We need to start looking at crime in a different way instead of draconian punishment that permanently makes people pariahs for life, unable to get educated, kept from housing, unable to vote, unable to be gainfully employed.....for a crime that they already went to jail for.    All we are doing is creating more criminals.  \n\nTHe Federal Government doesn't control state DAs so your point is moot anyway.   The idea that you would hold Trump up as a symbol of \"law and order\" is borderline insane.   Trump who pardoned people who committed crimes for him,who pardoned war criminal murderers, who is corrupt to the bone...if I listed his confirm-able crimes I would  be typing for the rest of my life.",

However, the vaccine continues to be effective at preventing serious disease.  Of course, in the most vulnerable populations, vaxxed or not, they're at maximum risk, so it makes a lot of sense to reduce your chances of spreading it to them.\n\nBesides spreading it to people at high risk, another good reason to not want to get covid, is because 25%-50% of people with it get \"long covid\", which appears to be an auto-immune disease kicked off by the immune system's response to covid.  Some people with long covid have serious disease, we don't know how long it will last.  New evidence in the past few weeks is that even people with asymptomatic covid (they were infected but never got sick so it never progressed to disease) are getting long covid, just like people who felt sick or were hospitalized.\n\nLastly, personal-experience wise, people who are not vaccinated, are also the most likely to live the high-risk (covid-wise) lifestyle.  Even if vaccines aren't perfect against infection or disease, if you're trying to avoid passing it to others or getting long covid autoimmune disease, best to avoid those at highest risk of having covid -- even if you don't get very sick, killing your grandma or getting long covid are less likely.\n\nNo reason to be insulted by all this.  It isn't personal -- it's just a bunch of rational and risk-management choices.",

Yes, the vaccine prevents a serious case of covid, but most SB\u2019s are at the age and health where they\u2019re super low risk anyway.\n\nRight, current vaccines aren't as efficient at preventing infection with omicron, but they're still efficient at preventing serious disease.  But even though SB is young and  healthy:\n\n1. If she's infected, she has just as much probability of developing long covid as anyone else, even if the infection doesn't progress to disease.  \"I didn't get covid, but did get a long-term autoimmune disease\" is not a win.\n2. If she's infected, she can pass it on to her grammy, who is still at serious risk.  \"I didn't get covid, but did kill my grammy\" is not a win.\n\nSo it's a rational choice to reduce contact with people likely to give you covid, and IME, unvaccinated people are the most likely to live a high-risk lifestyle.  They're the first ones to cut contact with.  Along with other lifestyle changes, you can reduce (but not remove) the risk\n\n\\*\\*\\* do note the vaccine is STILL somewhat (if less) effective at preventing infection, I haven't seen anything suggesting it's 0% effective against infection with omicron.  Given the same exposure, your vaccinated friend is still a bit less likely to get infected, and that's something",

Maybe because they care about the well beings of others around them? Not only that, but there are studies still being done on the long term effects of Covid, so why risk that at all?

The vaccines exist to prevent Covid but in the event you do get Covid, it will be a milder course and can prevent hospitalization. Being vaccinated and having a booster is significantly much better than being unvaccinated when having Omicron. Look at the patient population that is hospitalized. Majority of them are unvaccinated. Having people vaccinated can prevent future variants, so it shows to me someone\u2019s value when they choose to be unvaccinated. Unless you have a severe reaction or have some health condition preventing you from getting a vaccine, I don\u2019t care enough to associate with you, and I thank OP for reminding me as I too assumed most people are vaccinated. Not only that, but if someone decides against the vaccination, then I recommend they 100% commit to this by refusing any vaccination including the flu shot or Tdap should they step on a rusty nail. Why not live and die by your convictions?",

Keeping people in jail because they are too poor to make bail is an antiquated and corrupt practice.   In our justice system, less than 6% of all criminal cases go to trial because the system is designed to make you plead guilty even if you are innocent.   Prisons have been built by private companies across the country on the guarantee that their beds be filled.    The system is designed to make criminals out of everyday people.      Throw in Civil Asset Forfeiture, Qualified Immunity,  protection of criminal cops, Judges whose campaigns are paid for by prosecuting DAs, minorities going to jail at twice the numbers than whites for the same crimes etc etc etc... the whole Fascist system is corrupt and the only ones who want to fix it are NOT  Republicans.    \n\nNot sure what the New York DA is thinking but it doesn't allow you to credibly make blanket statements about all \"DAs in most the big cities.\"     So many peoples lives have been ruined by stupid little crimes of no consequence.   We need to start looking at crime in a different way instead of draconian punishment that permanently makes people pariahs for life, unable to get educated, kept from housing, unable to vote, unable to be gainfully employed.....for a crime that they already went to jail for.    All we are doing is creating more criminals.  \n\nTHe Federal Government doesn't control state DAs so your point is moot anyway.   The idea that you would hold Trump up as a symbol of \"law and order\" is borderline insane.   Trump who pardoned people who committed crimes for him,who pardoned war criminal murderers, who is corrupt to the bone...if I listed his confirm-able crimes I would  be typing for the rest of my life.",

The system is not racist, you just don't like the outcome. The single most dangerous person to a black male is another black male and the data overwhelmingly supports this. The fact that you think our system is fascist is quite telling. The vast majority of cops are good. Like all humans there are some bad ones. They need to be rooted out and bodycam is a great tool for this. I notice you don't go after teachers but you must be aware that black american test scores are terrible compared to every other group so the teachers must also be racist fascist right? Keep making heros out of George Floyd,only in a completely broken community would a man who broken into a pregnant woman's home and put a gun to her belly would that be possible.",

George Soros made a shit ton of money in one of the greatest trade deals in history, I believe it had something to do with the shorting the British pound or something,  Anyway, Rupert Murdoch lost a lot of money on the trade and in retaliation he set his media empire to smear Soros and paint him to be some sort of puppet master controlling left wing politics.   THe Soros right wing mythology is nothing more than a 20 year personal vendetta.   \n  Completely ridiculous when seen with the facts.   Also anti-semitic.   \n\nCrime needs to be fought with economic and social equality.   Change the root of crime instead of just punishing people for committing them.     \n\nA good cop who protects or ignores a bad cop is also a bad cop.  I would add they are worse because of their cowardice.     Do you know what happens to the career of a good cop that 'rats' out a bad cop?  Pretty much ends it.   The system is corrupt and needs to be reformed.",

However, the vaccine continues to be effective at preventing serious disease.  Of course, in the most vulnerable populations, vaxxed or not, they're at maximum risk, so it makes a lot of sense to reduce your chances of spreading it to them.\n\nBesides spreading it to people at high risk, another good reason to not want to get covid, is because 25%-50% of people with it get \"long covid\", which appears to be an auto-immune disease kicked off by the immune system's response to covid.  Some people with long covid have serious disease, we don't know how long it will last.  New evidence in the past few weeks is that even people with asymptomatic covid (they were infected but never got sick so it never progressed to disease) are getting long covid, just like people who felt sick or were hospitalized.\n\nLastly, personal-experience wise, people who are not vaccinated, are also the most likely to live the high-risk (covid-wise) lifestyle.  Even if vaccines aren't perfect against infection or disease, if you're trying to avoid passing it to others or getting long covid autoimmune disease, best to avoid those at highest risk of having covid -- even if you don't get very sick, killing your grandma or getting long covid are less likely.\n\nNo reason to be insulted by all this.  It isn't personal -- it's just a bunch of rational and risk-management choices.",

Yes, the vaccine prevents a serious case of covid, but most SB\u2019s are at the age and health where they\u2019re super low risk anyway.\n\nRight, current vaccines aren't as efficient at preventing infection with omicron, but they're still efficient at preventing serious disease.  But even though SB is young and  healthy:\n\n1. If she's infected, she has just as much probability of developing long covid as anyone else, even if the infection doesn't progress to disease.  \"I didn't get covid, but did get a long-term autoimmune disease\" is not a win.\n2. If she's infected, she can pass it on to her grammy, who is still at serious risk.  \"I didn't get covid, but did kill my grammy\" is not a win.\n\nSo it's a rational choice to reduce contact with people likely to give you covid, and IME, unvaccinated people are the most likely to live a high-risk lifestyle.  They're the first ones to cut contact with.  Along with other lifestyle changes, you can reduce (but not remove) the risk\n\n\\*\\*\\* do note the vaccine is STILL somewhat (if less) effective at preventing infection, I haven't seen anything suggesting it's 0% effective against infection with omicron.  Given the same exposure, your vaccinated friend is still a bit less likely to get infected, and that's something",

Yes, it\u2019s not to the same degree as the prior strand but still better and the prior strand still exists so that is still a risk. I also don\u2019t understand your logic here, because most SBs are low risk, why should they care about the vaccination status of others? Maybe because they care about the well beings of others around them? Not only that, but there are studies still being done on the long term effects of Covid, so why risk that at all? I\u2019m not holed up in my home, but being vaccinated requires the minimal of efforts, so I expect that from others especially if I\u2019m going to be spending my free time with them.",

Having people vaccinated can prevent future variants, so it shows to me someone\u2019s value when they choose to be unvaccinated. Unless you have a severe reaction or have some health condition preventing you from getting a vaccine, I don\u2019t care enough to associate with you, and I thank OP for reminding me as I too assumed most people are vaccinated. Not only that, but if someone decides against the vaccination, then I recommend they 100% commit to this by refusing any vaccination including the flu shot or Tdap should they step on a rusty nail. Why not live and die by your convictions?",

Keeping people in jail because they are too poor to make bail is an antiquated and corrupt practice.   In our justice system, less than 6% of all criminal cases go to trial because the system is designed to make you plead guilty even if you are innocent.   Prisons have been built by private companies across the country on the guarantee that their beds be filled.    The system is designed to make criminals out of everyday people.      Throw in Civil Asset Forfeiture, Qualified Immunity,  protection of criminal cops, Judges whose campaigns are paid for by prosecuting DAs, minorities going to jail at twice the numbers than whites for the same crimes etc etc etc... the whole Fascist system is corrupt and the only ones who want to fix it are NOT  Republicans.    \n\nNot sure what the New York DA is thinking but it doesn't allow you to credibly make blanket statements about all \"DAs in most the big cities.\"     So many peoples lives have been ruined by stupid little crimes of no consequence.   We need to start looking at crime in a different way instead of draconian punishment that permanently makes people pariahs for life, unable to get educated, kept from housing, unable to vote, unable to be gainfully employed.....for a crime that they already went to jail for.    All we are doing is creating more criminals.  \n\nTHe Federal Government doesn't control state DAs so your point is moot anyway.   The idea that you would hold Trump up as a symbol of \"law and order\" is borderline insane.   Trump who pardoned people who committed crimes for him,who pardoned war criminal murderers, who is corrupt to the bone...if I listed his confirm-able crimes I would  be typing for the rest of my life.",

The fact that you think our system is fascist is quite telling. The vast majority of cops are good. Like all humans there are some bad ones. They need to be rooted out and bodycam is a great tool for this. I notice you don't go after teachers but you must be aware that black american test scores are terrible compared to every other group so the teachers must also be racist fascist right?

George Soros made a shit ton of money in one of the greatest trade deals in history, I believe it had something to do with the shorting the British pound or something,  Anyway, Rupert Murdoch lost a lot of money on the trade and in retaliation he set his media empire to smear Soros and paint him to be some sort of puppet master controlling left wing politics.   THe Soros right wing mythology is nothing more than a 20 year personal vendetta.   \n  Completely ridiculous when seen with the facts.   Also anti-semitic.   \n\nCrime needs to be fought with economic and social equality.   Change the root of crime instead of just punishing people for committing them.     \n\nA good cop who protects or ignores a bad cop is also a bad cop.  I would add they are worse because of their cowardice.     Do you know what happens to the career of a good cop that 'rats' out a bad cop?  Pretty much ends it.   The system is corrupt and needs to be reformed.",

However, the vaccine continues to be effective at preventing serious disease.  Of course, in the most vulnerable populations, vaxxed or not, they're at maximum risk, so it makes a lot of sense to reduce your chances of spreading it to them.\n\nBesides spreading it to people at high risk, another good reason to not want to get covid, is because 25%-50% of people with it get \"long covid\", which appears to be an auto-immune disease kicked off by the immune system's response to covid.  Some people with long covid have serious disease, we don't know how long it will last.  New evidence in the past few weeks is that even people with asymptomatic covid (they were infected but never got sick so it never progressed to disease) are getting long covid, just like people who felt sick or were hospitalized.\n\nLastly, personal-experience wise, people who are not vaccinated, are also the most likely to live the high-risk (covid-wise) lifestyle.  Even if vaccines aren't perfect against infection or disease, if you're trying to avoid passing it to others or getting long covid autoimmune disease, best to avoid those at highest risk of having covid -- even if you don't get very sick, killing your grandma or getting long covid are less likely.\n\nNo reason to be insulted by all this.  It isn't personal -- it's just a bunch of rational and risk-management choices.",

Yes, the vaccine prevents a serious case of covid, but most SB\u2019s are at the age and health where they\u2019re super low risk anyway.\n\nRight, current vaccines aren't as efficient at preventing infection with omicron, but they're still efficient at preventing serious disease.  But even though SB is young and  healthy:\n\n1. If she's infected, she has just as much probability of developing long covid as anyone else, even if the infection doesn't progress to disease.  \"I didn't get covid, but did get a long-term autoimmune disease\" is not a win.\n2. If she's infected, she can pass it on to her grammy, who is still at serious risk.  \"I didn't get covid, but did kill my grammy\" is not a win.\n\nSo it's a rational choice to reduce contact with people likely to give you covid, and IME, unvaccinated people are the most likely to live a high-risk lifestyle.  They're the first ones to cut contact with.  Along with other lifestyle changes, you can reduce (but not remove) the risk\n\n\\*\\*\\* do note the vaccine is STILL somewhat (if less) effective at preventing infection, I haven't seen anything suggesting it's 0% effective against infection with omicron.  Given the same exposure, your vaccinated friend is still a bit less likely to get infected, and that's something",

But I will summarize below:\n\n1) People who are unvaccinated generally are carefree and not as mindful in their risk minimization of Covid, and I personally have no desire to contract Covid, mild or otherwise. Could I still get Covid from someone vaccinated? Absolutely, but in my experience, these people are more mindful and do more in their minimization of acquiring Covid by wearing mask or quarantining when necessary. \n2) I\u2019m in the medical field. I\u2019m personally frustrated seeing people who are unvaccinated and hospitalized knowing that this could have been avoidable for them. \n3) Extra salty at the existence of Omicron which could have been avoided had more people been vaccinated which would minimize the chance of the virus mutating.",

The vaccines exist to prevent Covid but in the event you do get Covid, it will be a milder course and can prevent hospitalization. Being vaccinated and having a booster is significantly much better than being unvaccinated when having Omicron. Look at the patient population that is hospitalized. Majority of them are unvaccinated. Having people vaccinated can prevent future variants, so it shows to me someone\u2019s value when they choose to be unvaccinated. Unless you have a severe reaction or have some health condition preventing you from getting a vaccine, I don\u2019t care enough to associate with you, and I thank OP for reminding me as I too assumed most people are vaccinated. Not only that, but if someone decides against the vaccination, then I recommend they 100% commit to this by refusing any vaccination including the flu shot or Tdap should they step on a rusty nail. Why not live and die by your convictions?",

Keeping people in jail because they are too poor to make bail is an antiquated and corrupt practice.   In our justice system, less than 6% of all criminal cases go to trial because the system is designed to make you plead guilty even if you are innocent.   Prisons have been built by private companies across the country on the guarantee that their beds be filled.    The system is designed to make criminals out of everyday people.      Throw in Civil Asset Forfeiture, Qualified Immunity,  protection of criminal cops, Judges whose campaigns are paid for by prosecuting DAs, minorities going to jail at twice the numbers than whites for the same crimes etc etc etc... the whole Fascist system is corrupt and the only ones who want to fix it are NOT  Republicans.    \n\nNot sure what the New York DA is thinking but it doesn't allow you to credibly make blanket statements about all \"DAs in most the big cities.\"     So many peoples lives have been ruined by stupid little crimes of no consequence.   We need to start looking at crime in a different way instead of draconian punishment that permanently makes people pariahs for life, unable to get educated, kept from housing, unable to vote, unable to be gainfully employed.....for a crime that they already went to jail for.    All we are doing is creating more criminals.  \n\nTHe Federal Government doesn't control state DAs so your point is moot anyway.   The idea that you would hold Trump up as a symbol of \"law and order\" is borderline insane.   Trump who pardoned people who committed crimes for him,who pardoned war criminal murderers, who is corrupt to the bone...if I listed his confirm-able crimes I would  be typing for the rest of my life.",

The fact that you think our system is fascist is quite telling. The vast majority of cops are good. Like all humans there are some bad ones. They need to be rooted out and bodycam is a great tool for this. I notice you don't go after teachers but you must be aware that black american test scores are terrible compared to every other group so the teachers must also be racist fascist right?

THe Soros right wing mythology is nothing more than a 20 year personal vendetta.   \n  Completely ridiculous when seen with the facts.   Also anti-semitic.   \n\nCrime needs to be fought with economic and social equality.   Change the root of crime instead of just punishing people for committing them.     \n\nA good cop who protects or ignores a bad cop is also a bad cop.  I would add they are worse because of their cowardice.     Do you know what happens to the career of a good cop that 'rats' out a bad cop?  Pretty much ends it.

Yes, the vaccine prevents a serious case of covid, but most SB\u2019s are at the age and health where they\u2019re super low risk anyway.\n\nRight, current vaccines aren't as efficient at preventing infection with omicron, but they're still efficient at preventing serious disease.  But even though SB is young and  healthy:\n\n1. If she's infected, she has just as much probability of developing long covid as anyone else, even if the infection doesn't progress to disease.  \"I didn't get covid, but did get a long-term autoimmune disease\" is not a win.\n2. If she's infected, she can pass it on to her grammy, who is still at serious risk.  \"I didn't get covid, but did kill my grammy\" is not a win.\n\nSo it's a rational choice to reduce contact with people likely to give you covid, and IME, unvaccinated people are the most likely to live a high-risk lifestyle.  They're the first ones to cut contact with.  Along with other lifestyle changes, you can reduce (but not remove) the risk\n\n\\*\\*\\* do note the vaccine is STILL somewhat (if less) effective at preventing infection, I haven't seen anything suggesting it's 0% effective against infection with omicron.  Given the same exposure, your vaccinated friend is still a bit less likely to get infected, and that's something",

Keep making heros out of George Floyd,only in a completely broken community would a man who broken into a pregnant woman's home and put a gun to her belly would that be possible.",

George Soros made a shit ton of money in one of the greatest trade deals in history, I believe it had something to do with the shorting the British pound or something,  Anyway, Rupert Murdoch lost a lot of money on the trade and in retaliation he set his media empire to smear Soros and paint him to be some sort of puppet master controlling left wing politics.   THe Soros right wing mythology is nothing more than a 20 year personal vendetta.   \n  Completely ridiculous when seen with the facts.   Also anti-semitic.   \n\nCrime needs to be fought with economic and social equality.   Change the root of crime instead of just punishing people for committing them.     \n\nA good cop who protects or ignores a bad cop is also a bad cop.  I would add they are worse because of their cowardice.     Do you know what happens to the career of a good cop that 'rats' out a bad cop?  Pretty much ends it.   The system is corrupt and needs to be reformed.",

But if someone is afraid of catching covid from someone, it appears as if the current vaccines don\u2019t prevent infection very well from the omicron variant. Yes, the vaccine prevents a serious case of covid, but most SB\u2019s are at the age and health where they\u2019re super low risk anyway.\n\nRight, current vaccines aren't as efficient at preventing infection with omicron, but they're still efficient at preventing serious disease.  But even though SB is young and  healthy:\n\n1. If she's infected, she has just as much probability of developing long covid as anyone else, even if the infection doesn't progress to disease.  \"I didn't get covid, but did get a long-term autoimmune disease\" is not a win.\n2. If she's infected, she can pass it on to her grammy, who is still at serious risk.  \"I didn't get covid, but did kill my grammy\" is not a win.\n\nSo it's a rational choice to reduce contact with people likely to give you covid, and IME, unvaccinated people are the most likely to live a high-risk lifestyle.  They're the first ones to cut contact with.  Along with other lifestyle changes, you can reduce (but not remove) the risk\n\n\\*\\*\\* do note the vaccine is STILL somewhat (if less) effective at preventing infection, I haven't seen anything suggesting it's 0% effective against infection with omicron.  Given the same exposure, your vaccinated friend is still a bit less likely to get infected, and that's something",

I do actually have this conversation with my POTs too, some are vaxxed but back to full-blown partying, and I pass on them.  Many are vaxxed and still cautious, and we agree that if one of us does something high risk, we'll reveal it, consider a rapid test before we meet again, etc",

Yes, it\u2019s not to the same degree as the prior strand but still better and the prior strand still exists so that is still a risk. I also don\u2019t understand your logic here, because most SBs are low risk, why should they care about the vaccination status of others? Maybe because they care about the well beings of others around them? Not only that, but there are studies still being done on the long term effects of Covid, so why risk that at all? I\u2019m not holed up in my home, but being vaccinated requires the minimal of efforts, so I expect that from others especially if I\u2019m going to be spending my free time with them.",

But I will summarize below:\n\n1) People who are unvaccinated generally are carefree and not as mindful in their risk minimization of Covid, and I personally have no desire to contract Covid, mild or otherwise. Could I still get Covid from someone vaccinated? Absolutely, but in my experience, these people are more mindful and do more in their minimization of acquiring Covid by wearing mask or quarantining when necessary. \n2) I\u2019m in the medical field. I\u2019m personally frustrated seeing people who are unvaccinated and hospitalized knowing that this could have been avoidable for them. \n3) Extra salty at the existence of Omicron which could have been avoided had more people been vaccinated which would minimize the chance of the virus mutating.",

THe Soros right wing mythology is nothing more than a 20 year personal vendetta.   \n  Completely ridiculous when seen with the facts.   Also anti-semitic.   \n\nCrime needs to be fought with economic and social equality.   Change the root of crime instead of just punishing people for committing them.     \n\nA good cop who protects or ignores a bad cop is also a bad cop.  I would add they are worse because of their cowardice.     Do you know what happens to the career of a good cop that 'rats' out a bad cop?  Pretty much ends it.

But I will summarize below:\n\n1) People who are unvaccinated generally are carefree and not as mindful in their risk minimization of Covid, and I personally have no desire to contract Covid, mild or otherwise. Could I still get Covid from someone vaccinated? Absolutely, but in my experience, these people are more mindful and do more in their minimization of acquiring Covid by wearing mask or quarantining when necessary. \n2) I\u2019m in the medical field. I\u2019m personally frustrated seeing people who are unvaccinated and hospitalized knowing that this could have been avoidable for them. \n3) Extra salty at the existence of Omicron which could have been avoided had more people been vaccinated which would minimize the chance of the virus mutating.",

Absolutely, but in my experience, these people are more mindful and do more in their minimization of acquiring Covid by wearing mask or quarantining when necessary. \n2) I\u2019m in the medical field. I\u2019m personally frustrated seeing people who are unvaccinated and hospitalized knowing that this could have been avoidable for them. \n3) Extra salty at the existence of Omicron which could have been avoided had more people been vaccinated which would minimize the chance of the virus mutating.",
