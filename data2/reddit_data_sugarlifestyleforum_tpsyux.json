Some of you aspiring SBs wonder why you can't find any sort of SD, so I'll tell you...\n\nIf this is your attitude... if this is your idea of a WIN, trust me, any guy can see right through it. And to bring back the usual discussion of the differences between a SB or a sex worker or an escort or whatever; if your attitude is to treat a SD or POT with this incredible shallowness, like nothing more than an ATM out which you're trying to squeeze the max, you'll find your SRs very short-lived.\n\nAnd sure, if this is what you're after, great. If you can find some simp who'll keep you happy by just throwing more and more money at you for shallower and shallower things, fantastic. Good for you. But I think you're posting in the wrong forum.\n\nOR, don't complain you can't find a guy with whom you have a true connection. Something meaningful. Something more than transactional. You can't have it both ways.\n\ntldr: Your SD is more than a shoe-collection ATM, but if that's how you treat him -- if that's what you consider success and that's what comes across -- he won't be your SD too much longer.\u201d \n\n===\n\nLADIES: Take note of such hateful bitter salt daddies men who are jealous of the ladies end of the bargain. \n\nPursue your BAG.

Also look at OP's post history for posts about \"Best way to fake it\".\n\nSure, perhaps my comment was a little bit overboard, and for that I apologize. But I'll stick to my idea that many SBs will be happy to burn a potential LTSR at the expense of short-term gain. Trust me, from this side of things, and I have had many, many SRs and POT SRs and initial meetings... and notwithstanding I'm very much on the upper edge of what anyone would consider generous...\n\nThere is a BIG BIG BIG difference, for a guy who's worked DECADES making his millions, between giving gifts and feeling like those gifts are being extracted from him. In my case, I don't care about the $ amount as much as I care about the implication behind it. I ended a SR because 5 minutes after she left with her very generous gift I'd given her for her birthday (fancy purse she'd hinted at), she posted it on Instagram... on her public account which clearly she didn't realize I was following.\n\nIt was a crass sort of message, much like OP's here -- \"don't mean to brag, but check out what I extracted from my SD\" -- not in those words exactly, but that was the message. Followed by dozens of \"GET IT GIRL!!!\" and \"WORK IT!!!\" etc etc.\n\nSo... perhaps this is why this rubbed me the wrong way more than it should've.\n\nBut back to my story, I didn't feel she'd extracted anything from me. I knew she wanted that particular purse. I was happy to get it for her, and her glee of delight when she saw it made it worth it. Which is why shortly thereafter, it's hard to put into words how used I felt. Just another notch in her belt. And don't get me wrong, nobody understands SRs better than me, and one thing I always always always honour is the discretion aspect. No matter what. This shattered everything... instantly.\n\nSo, back to what I posted... I stick with that; ladies, if you come across like this, you will scare away your SD, or perhaps not ever meet him in the first place.\n\nAnd I deleted it because I knew it was going to be met with the one-sided derision such as what you posted... but since you felt it necessary to screenshot it and spam in all over this discussion, I guess I took the time to explain my stance with some eloquence.\n\nAlso -- don't resort to name-calling, especially when you're not clear with respect to what you're talking about. It doesn't add anything to your argument. And there's usually more to the story.",

But on reddit I think that is better, since a SB can post about it here amongst other SB's without any other people knowing about it. Which makes it much more discreet. Especially if the SD is in a marriage or other relationship and the SB is a secret, I can imagine the discretion being very important.\n\nAbout the fact that you feel like SB feel like they have extracted something from you when you give them expensive gifts and they boast about it, you might be reading it differently than they are actually experiencing it. I am not a SB, but if I got an amazing gift that I really wanted I would feel proud. Not because I extracted something from the person that gave me the gift (in fact, that thought would not even cross my mind), but because it would make me feel worthy. It would make me feel validated. That the person appreciates me, likes me, needs me, perhaps even loves me (if that is part of the relationship,). That they like the way I look, that they think I am pretty and sexy, that they like sexual activity with me and that they like me as a person. That they deem me worthy of spending money on. The best feelings I would get if the gift is something that is meaningful to me or something I really wanted. So not just any random expensive gift like a designer bag or shoes, but something I really like personally. Like getting me a lovely pair of converse in a colour or style I like or have been wanting, a perfume I really love but have run out of, a book by one of my favourite authors, a cute card that has butterfly's on it, some delicious vegan chocolate, etc. Just something personal to me that I like. Because that means that I am not just worthy of their money but also of their time and effort. They care enough to actually listen to you and get to know you so they know what you like, so they aren't just using you like a sex doll or a maid or someone to pass the time with. They care enough to spend time and effort to really search for something you really like. And if the thing I like that they get for me is something expensive as well, then that might feel even better.\n\nMy point is, it is wonderful to feel and be valued by another person. SB's are human and have feelings and most of them probably feel this way when a SD gifts them a good gift. It is a goal to achieve because to them it feels like leveling up as a person. They feel happy and giddy about it and they feel the need to share that. It doesn't mean they see you as an ATM and it doesn't mean they don't value you (the SD) as a person. It doesn't mean there isn't a real connection and it doesn't mean there aren't any real feelings.\n\n\nAnd yes I am sure there are some SB's that do use their SD's as an ATM and a wishing well. And I am sure there are also SD's that treat their SB's as an expensive whore without connection and also SD's that just give expensive shit without caring about what the SB would actually like to receive.",

And to bring back the usual discussion of the differences between a SB or a sex worker or an escort or whatever; if your attitude is to treat a SD or POT with this incredible shallowness, like nothing more than an ATM out which you're trying to squeeze the max, you'll find your SRs very short-lived.\n\nAnd sure, if this is what you're after, great. If you can find some simp who'll keep you happy by just throwing more and more money at you for shallower and shallower things, fantastic. Good for you.

                            "body": "Look at my post history and see if that fits your \"demoralizing salt daddy\" label. Also look at OP's post history for posts about \"Best way to fake it\".\n\nSure, perhaps my comment was a little bit overboard, and for that I apologize. But I'll stick to my idea that many SBs will be happy to burn a potential LTSR at the expense of short-term gain. Trust me, from this side of things, and I have had many, many SRs and POT SRs and initial meetings... and notwithstanding I'm very much on the upper edge of what anyone would consider generous...\n\nThere is a BIG BIG BIG difference, for a guy who's worked DECADES making his millions, between giving gifts and feeling like those gifts are being extracted from him. In my case, I don't care about the $ amount as much as I care about the implication behind it. I ended a SR because 5 minutes after she left with her very generous gift I'd given her for her birthday (fancy purse she'd hinted at), she posted it on Instagram... on her public account which clearly she didn't realize I was following.\n\nIt was a crass sort of message, much like OP's here -- \"don't mean to brag, but check out what I extracted from my SD\" -- not in those words exactly, but that was the message. Followed by dozens of \"GET IT GIRL!!!\" and \"WORK IT!!!\" etc etc.\n\nSo... perhaps this is why this rubbed me the wrong way more than it should've.\n\nBut back to my story, I didn't feel she'd extracted anything from me. I knew she wanted that particular purse. I was happy to get it for her, and her glee of delight when she saw it made it worth it. Which is why shortly thereafter, it's hard to put into words how used I felt. Just another notch in her belt. And don't get me wrong, nobody understands SRs better than me, and one thing I always always always honour is the discretion aspect. No matter what. This shattered everything... instantly.\n\nSo, back to what I posted... I stick with that; ladies, if you come across like this, you will scare away your SD, or perhaps not ever meet him in the first place.\n\nAnd I deleted it because I knew it was going to be met with the one-sided derision such as what you posted... but since you felt it necessary to screenshot it and spam in all over this discussion, I guess I took the time to explain my stance with some eloquence.\n\nAlso -- don't resort to name-calling, especially when you're not clear with respect to what you're talking about. It doesn't add anything to your argument. And there's usually more to the story.",

                                    "body": "I can understand you being bummed about the discretion part if a SB does that in public, like on instagram. But on reddit I think that is better, since a SB can post about it here amongst other SB's without any other people knowing about it. Which makes it much more discreet. Especially if the SD is in a marriage or other relationship and the SB is a secret, I can imagine the discretion being very important.\n\nAbout the fact that you feel like SB feel like they have extracted something from you when you give them expensive gifts and they boast about it, you might be reading it differently than they are actually experiencing it. I am not a SB, but if I got an amazing gift that I really wanted I would feel proud. Not because I extracted something from the person that gave me the gift (in fact, that thought would not even cross my mind), but because it would make me feel worthy. It would make me feel validated. That the person appreciates me, likes me, needs me, perhaps even loves me (if that is part of the relationship,). That they like the way I look, that they think I am pretty and sexy, that they like sexual activity with me and that they like me as a person. That they deem me worthy of spending money on. The best feelings I would get if the gift is something that is meaningful to me or something I really wanted. So not just any random expensive gift like a designer bag or shoes, but something I really like personally. Like getting me a lovely pair of converse in a colour or style I like or have been wanting, a perfume I really love but have run out of, a book by one of my favourite authors, a cute card that has butterfly's on it, some delicious vegan chocolate, etc. Just something personal to me that I like. Because that means that I am not just worthy of their money but also of their time and effort. They care enough to actually listen to you and get to know you so they know what you like, so they aren't just using you like a sex doll or a maid or someone to pass the time with. They care enough to spend time and effort to really search for something you really like. And if the thing I like that they get for me is something expensive as well, then that might feel even better.\n\nMy point is, it is wonderful to feel and be valued by another person. SB's are human and have feelings and most of them probably feel this way when a SD gifts them a good gift. It is a goal to achieve because to them it feels like leveling up as a person. They feel happy and giddy about it and they feel the need to share that. It doesn't mean they see you as an ATM and it doesn't mean they don't value you (the SD) as a person. It doesn't mean there isn't a real connection and it doesn't mean there aren't any real feelings.\n\n\nAnd yes I am sure there are some SB's that do use their SD's as an ATM and a wishing well. And I am sure there are also SD's that treat their SB's as an expensive whore without connection and also SD's that just give expensive shit without caring about what the SB would actually like to receive.",

Also look at OP's post history for posts about \"Best way to fake it\".\n\nSure, perhaps my comment was a little bit overboard, and for that I apologize. But I'll stick to my idea that many SBs will be happy to burn a potential LTSR at the expense of short-term gain. Trust me, from this side of things, and I have had many, many SRs and POT SRs and initial meetings... and notwithstanding I'm very much on the upper edge of what anyone would consider generous...\n\nThere is a BIG BIG BIG difference, for a guy who's worked DECADES making his millions, between giving gifts and feeling like those gifts are being extracted from him. In my case, I don't care about the $ amount as much as I care about the implication behind it. I ended a SR because 5 minutes after she left with her very generous gift I'd given her for her birthday (fancy purse she'd hinted at), she posted it on Instagram... on her public account which clearly she didn't realize I was following.\n\nIt was a crass sort of message, much like OP's here -- \"don't mean to brag, but check out what I extracted from my SD\" -- not in those words exactly, but that was the message. Followed by dozens of \"GET IT GIRL!!!\" and \"WORK IT!!!\" etc etc.\n\nSo... perhaps this is why this rubbed me the wrong way more than it should've.\n\nBut back to my story, I didn't feel she'd extracted anything from me. I knew she wanted that particular purse. I was happy to get it for her, and her glee of delight when she saw it made it worth it. Which is why shortly thereafter, it's hard to put into words how used I felt. Just another notch in her belt. And don't get me wrong, nobody understands SRs better than me, and one thing I always always always honour is the discretion aspect. No matter what. This shattered everything... instantly.\n\nSo, back to what I posted... I stick with that; ladies, if you come across like this, you will scare away your SD, or perhaps not ever meet him in the first place.\n\nAnd I deleted it because I knew it was going to be met with the one-sided derision such as what you posted... but since you felt it necessary to screenshot it and spam in all over this discussion, I guess I took the time to explain my stance with some eloquence.\n\nAlso -- don't resort to name-calling, especially when you're not clear with respect to what you're talking about. It doesn't add anything to your argument. And there's usually more to the story.",

                            "body": "I can understand you being bummed about the discretion part if a SB does that in public, like on instagram. But on reddit I think that is better, since a SB can post about it here amongst other SB's without any other people knowing about it. Which makes it much more discreet. Especially if the SD is in a marriage or other relationship and the SB is a secret, I can imagine the discretion being very important.\n\nAbout the fact that you feel like SB feel like they have extracted something from you when you give them expensive gifts and they boast about it, you might be reading it differently than they are actually experiencing it. I am not a SB, but if I got an amazing gift that I really wanted I would feel proud. Not because I extracted something from the person that gave me the gift (in fact, that thought would not even cross my mind), but because it would make me feel worthy. It would make me feel validated. That the person appreciates me, likes me, needs me, perhaps even loves me (if that is part of the relationship,). That they like the way I look, that they think I am pretty and sexy, that they like sexual activity with me and that they like me as a person. That they deem me worthy of spending money on. The best feelings I would get if the gift is something that is meaningful to me or something I really wanted. So not just any random expensive gift like a designer bag or shoes, but something I really like personally. Like getting me a lovely pair of converse in a colour or style I like or have been wanting, a perfume I really love but have run out of, a book by one of my favourite authors, a cute card that has butterfly's on it, some delicious vegan chocolate, etc. Just something personal to me that I like. Because that means that I am not just worthy of their money but also of their time and effort. They care enough to actually listen to you and get to know you so they know what you like, so they aren't just using you like a sex doll or a maid or someone to pass the time with. They care enough to spend time and effort to really search for something you really like. And if the thing I like that they get for me is something expensive as well, then that might feel even better.\n\nMy point is, it is wonderful to feel and be valued by another person. SB's are human and have feelings and most of them probably feel this way when a SD gifts them a good gift. It is a goal to achieve because to them it feels like leveling up as a person. They feel happy and giddy about it and they feel the need to share that. It doesn't mean they see you as an ATM and it doesn't mean they don't value you (the SD) as a person. It doesn't mean there isn't a real connection and it doesn't mean there aren't any real feelings.\n\n\nAnd yes I am sure there are some SB's that do use their SD's as an ATM and a wishing well. And I am sure there are also SD's that treat their SB's as an expensive whore without connection and also SD's that just give expensive shit without caring about what the SB would actually like to receive.",

            "body": "Look at my post history and see if that fits your \"demoralizing salt daddy\" label. Also look at OP's post history for posts about \"Best way to fake it\".\n\nSure, perhaps my comment was a little bit overboard, and for that I apologize. But I'll stick to my idea that many SBs will be happy to burn a potential LTSR at the expense of short-term gain. Trust me, from this side of things, and I have had many, many SRs and POT SRs and initial meetings... and notwithstanding I'm very much on the upper edge of what anyone would consider generous...\n\nThere is a BIG BIG BIG difference, for a guy who's worked DECADES making his millions, between giving gifts and feeling like those gifts are being extracted from him. In my case, I don't care about the $ amount as much as I care about the implication behind it. I ended a SR because 5 minutes after she left with her very generous gift I'd given her for her birthday (fancy purse she'd hinted at), she posted it on Instagram... on her public account which clearly she didn't realize I was following.\n\nIt was a crass sort of message, much like OP's here -- \"don't mean to brag, but check out what I extracted from my SD\" -- not in those words exactly, but that was the message. Followed by dozens of \"GET IT GIRL!!!\" and \"WORK IT!!!\" etc etc.\n\nSo... perhaps this is why this rubbed me the wrong way more than it should've.\n\nBut back to my story, I didn't feel she'd extracted anything from me. I knew she wanted that particular purse. I was happy to get it for her, and her glee of delight when she saw it made it worth it. Which is why shortly thereafter, it's hard to put into words how used I felt. Just another notch in her belt. And don't get me wrong, nobody understands SRs better than me, and one thing I always always always honour is the discretion aspect. No matter what. This shattered everything... instantly.\n\nSo, back to what I posted... I stick with that; ladies, if you come across like this, you will scare away your SD, or perhaps not ever meet him in the first place.\n\nAnd I deleted it because I knew it was going to be met with the one-sided derision such as what you posted... but since you felt it necessary to screenshot it and spam in all over this discussion, I guess I took the time to explain my stance with some eloquence.\n\nAlso -- don't resort to name-calling, especially when you're not clear with respect to what you're talking about. It doesn't add anything to your argument. And there's usually more to the story.",

                    "body": "I can understand you being bummed about the discretion part if a SB does that in public, like on instagram. But on reddit I think that is better, since a SB can post about it here amongst other SB's without any other people knowing about it. Which makes it much more discreet. Especially if the SD is in a marriage or other relationship and the SB is a secret, I can imagine the discretion being very important.\n\nAbout the fact that you feel like SB feel like they have extracted something from you when you give them expensive gifts and they boast about it, you might be reading it differently than they are actually experiencing it. I am not a SB, but if I got an amazing gift that I really wanted I would feel proud. Not because I extracted something from the person that gave me the gift (in fact, that thought would not even cross my mind), but because it would make me feel worthy. It would make me feel validated. That the person appreciates me, likes me, needs me, perhaps even loves me (if that is part of the relationship,). That they like the way I look, that they think I am pretty and sexy, that they like sexual activity with me and that they like me as a person. That they deem me worthy of spending money on. The best feelings I would get if the gift is something that is meaningful to me or something I really wanted. So not just any random expensive gift like a designer bag or shoes, but something I really like personally. Like getting me a lovely pair of converse in a colour or style I like or have been wanting, a perfume I really love but have run out of, a book by one of my favourite authors, a cute card that has butterfly's on it, some delicious vegan chocolate, etc. Just something personal to me that I like. Because that means that I am not just worthy of their money but also of their time and effort. They care enough to actually listen to you and get to know you so they know what you like, so they aren't just using you like a sex doll or a maid or someone to pass the time with. They care enough to spend time and effort to really search for something you really like. And if the thing I like that they get for me is something expensive as well, then that might feel even better.\n\nMy point is, it is wonderful to feel and be valued by another person. SB's are human and have feelings and most of them probably feel this way when a SD gifts them a good gift. It is a goal to achieve because to them it feels like leveling up as a person. They feel happy and giddy about it and they feel the need to share that. It doesn't mean they see you as an ATM and it doesn't mean they don't value you (the SD) as a person. It doesn't mean there isn't a real connection and it doesn't mean there aren't any real feelings.\n\n\nAnd yes I am sure there are some SB's that do use their SD's as an ATM and a wishing well. And I am sure there are also SD's that treat their SB's as an expensive whore without connection and also SD's that just give expensive shit without caring about what the SB would actually like to receive.",

            "body": "I can understand you being bummed about the discretion part if a SB does that in public, like on instagram. But on reddit I think that is better, since a SB can post about it here amongst other SB's without any other people knowing about it. Which makes it much more discreet. Especially if the SD is in a marriage or other relationship and the SB is a secret, I can imagine the discretion being very important.\n\nAbout the fact that you feel like SB feel like they have extracted something from you when you give them expensive gifts and they boast about it, you might be reading it differently than they are actually experiencing it. I am not a SB, but if I got an amazing gift that I really wanted I would feel proud. Not because I extracted something from the person that gave me the gift (in fact, that thought would not even cross my mind), but because it would make me feel worthy. It would make me feel validated. That the person appreciates me, likes me, needs me, perhaps even loves me (if that is part of the relationship,). That they like the way I look, that they think I am pretty and sexy, that they like sexual activity with me and that they like me as a person. That they deem me worthy of spending money on. The best feelings I would get if the gift is something that is meaningful to me or something I really wanted. So not just any random expensive gift like a designer bag or shoes, but something I really like personally. Like getting me a lovely pair of converse in a colour or style I like or have been wanting, a perfume I really love but have run out of, a book by one of my favourite authors, a cute card that has butterfly's on it, some delicious vegan chocolate, etc. Just something personal to me that I like. Because that means that I am not just worthy of their money but also of their time and effort. They care enough to actually listen to you and get to know you so they know what you like, so they aren't just using you like a sex doll or a maid or someone to pass the time with. They care enough to spend time and effort to really search for something you really like. And if the thing I like that they get for me is something expensive as well, then that might feel even better.\n\nMy point is, it is wonderful to feel and be valued by another person. SB's are human and have feelings and most of them probably feel this way when a SD gifts them a good gift. It is a goal to achieve because to them it feels like leveling up as a person. They feel happy and giddy about it and they feel the need to share that. It doesn't mean they see you as an ATM and it doesn't mean they don't value you (the SD) as a person. It doesn't mean there isn't a real connection and it doesn't mean there aren't any real feelings.\n\n\nAnd yes I am sure there are some SB's that do use their SD's as an ATM and a wishing well. And I am sure there are also SD's that treat their SB's as an expensive whore without connection and also SD's that just give expensive shit without caring about what the SB would actually like to receive.",
