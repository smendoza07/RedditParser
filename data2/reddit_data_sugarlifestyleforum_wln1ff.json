    "body": "It's driving me insane. Been on the site on and off for a decade and everyone wants a cheap car date it's insane. Are there no genuine daddies left in upstate ny?\n\nEdit for the incels~ yes I had a terrible arrangement with a 70 year old 2 years ago. I have since had an amazing 2 year arrangement that recently ended due to distance. Yes I also provide FS, no that does not change the fact I am also a sugar baby. As I did the past 2 years with my daddy's approval. I had him and this awesome genuine relationship we built with mutual chemistry and trust and friendship, and hourly clients I would occasionally take on days we were not together or that he was out of town for work (the thing that in the end caused me to officially end the arrangement) yall have accomplished nothing \"digging up\" these \"well hidden\" (my profile is all about being a SW this shit has never been a secret) as they change nothing about what I've said. Me separately having ads elsewhere doesn't change the fact when I ask a potential daddy on the site their favorite cuisine or genre of music as an ice breaker they immediately respond with \"what's your ppm\" or \"do you do ppm\" and when I say no for fear of being banned they leave me on read because that's all they're looking for",

I was considering dancing but I'd literally have to drive an hour and a half to the next city for a club at the lowest end of my standards to work in so definitely no strip club around here to find that. Let's just say I'm shocked I haven't yet seen someone try and throw coins at the dancers in my city yet. I've been to a few wine tastings recently but all I met was a group of middle aged women (I go both ways but no vibes there) a group of women my age on a Bachelorette weekend, a group of married couples who were kind but obviously not that vibe and a staff member that offered to smoke me up on a blunt out back \ud83d\ude2d the bigger problem is the gun violence has gotten terrible in my city so events are scarce and tbh a little scary to go to but I'll keep my eyes out. I think I might just need to go the look hot as hell in a high end bar direction",

And before you try it yes my SD knew and fully supported it. Dude was traveling anywhere from a week to 2 months at a time he didn't give a shit about me filling some of my time between meets with hourly fs clients. What I'm shocked about is the way that 2 years ago I had 4 great options with 4 fantastic potential sugar daddies, chose the one I vibed with best and kept him for the past 2 years. Now he travels too much and now that I'm back looking for another long term arrangement on the same site everyone's a fake or broke. I was able to get in contact with 1 of the guys from a couple years ago but he's since gotten married and is only interested in hiring by the hour (which is ofc fine as I also provide that service) but I just can't seem to find any options now like the ones I found previously abundant. They're even talking now about allowance 1/2 to 1/3 of what was normal conversation prior to 2 years ago (I've been on the site for 9 years on and off)",

It's a self fuffiling cycle.  \n\nI believe there is a good *chance* the same thing is happening to you.  If you approach sugaring with a sex work/escort mentality, you are largely going to get the people either *looking* for escorts, or people that are \"too cheap for escorts\" (But effectively want an escort).\n\nThought number 2?  \n\n\"Upstate New York\".\n\nLocation is everything.

I like sex that feels good. Sex is only good for me with a genuine connection built. I like going out for nice dinners, going to concerts and trips and weekends away. I'm a polyamorous person and I genuinely just prefer to find my secondary partners as sugar daddies as I find the relationships more fulfilling and mentally stimulating. I have the looks where pre covid I regularly got asked just to be arm candy for corporate events because I know how to carry myself and im college educated and well spoken.

You are also competing against hundreds of others so all of a sudden when life and other guys on tinder have told you youre amazing and gorgeous now you are getting passed over. Unlike tinder the only easy attention you get are from those guys copying and pasting into every inbox thats been online in the last 3 days..the equivalent of swiping on every profile hoping for a match. Some will be genuine but most wont be. Read their profiles and youll notice who comes across as serious and who is just playing the numbers game and making easy promises \"message me if you want to get spoiled\".  \nA good tip, create a fake SD profile with a fake email address, no pics needed and check out your competition x",

This has proven to be impossible despite me working many hours a week to try and save up. As a result I have resorted to asking for help from well wishers.

Let's just say I'm shocked I haven't yet seen someone try and throw coins at the dancers in my city yet. I've been to a few wine tastings recently but all I met was a group of middle aged women (I go both ways but no vibes there) a group of women my age on a Bachelorette weekend, a group of married couples who were kind but obviously not that vibe and a staff member that offered to smoke me up on a blunt out back \ud83d\ude2d the bigger problem is the gun violence has gotten terrible in my city so events are scarce and tbh a little scary to go to but I'll keep my eyes out.

And before you try it yes my SD knew and fully supported it. Dude was traveling anywhere from a week to 2 months at a time he didn't give a shit about me filling some of my time between meets with hourly fs clients. What I'm shocked about is the way that 2 years ago I had 4 great options with 4 fantastic potential sugar daddies, chose the one I vibed with best and kept him for the past 2 years. Now he travels too much and now that I'm back looking for another long term arrangement on the same site everyone's a fake or broke. I was able to get in contact with 1 of the guys from a couple years ago but he's since gotten married and is only interested in hiring by the hour (which is ofc fine as I also provide that service) but I just can't seem to find any options now like the ones I found previously abundant. They're even talking now about allowance 1/2 to 1/3 of what was normal conversation prior to 2 years ago (I've been on the site for 9 years on and off)",

I'm a polyamorous person and I genuinely just prefer to find my secondary partners as sugar daddies as I find the relationships more fulfilling and mentally stimulating.

I've been to a few wine tastings recently but all I met was a group of middle aged women (I go both ways but no vibes there) a group of women my age on a Bachelorette weekend, a group of married couples who were kind but obviously not that vibe and a staff member that offered to smoke me up on a blunt out back \ud83d\ude2d the bigger problem is the gun violence has gotten terrible in my city so events are scarce and tbh a little scary to go to but I'll keep my eyes out.

What I'm shocked about is the way that 2 years ago I had 4 great options with 4 fantastic potential sugar daddies, chose the one I vibed with best and kept him for the past 2 years. Now he travels too much and now that I'm back looking for another long term arrangement on the same site everyone's a fake or broke. I was able to get in contact with 1 of the guys from a couple years ago but he's since gotten married and is only interested in hiring by the hour (which is ofc fine as I also provide that service) but I just can't seem to find any options now like the ones I found previously abundant. They're even talking now about allowance 1/2 to 1/3 of what was normal conversation prior to 2 years ago (I've been on the site for 9 years on and off)",

Do you realize that every 4th message I get on seeking is asking me for a car date when the arrangement I outline is one with frequent meets including platonic ones, frequent communication (I like SD because I'm lonely too and I love the company and building close relationships with people) I basically say that I'm looking for a mentor to enjoy shows, dinners, events and travel with and half my messages are like \"what's your ppm?\" Which I won't even entertain",

Let's just say I'm shocked I haven't yet seen someone try and throw coins at the dancers in my city yet. I've been to a few wine tastings recently but all I met was a group of middle aged women (I go both ways but no vibes there) a group of women my age on a Bachelorette weekend, a group of married couples who were kind but obviously not that vibe and a staff member that offered to smoke me up on a blunt out back \ud83d\ude2d the bigger problem is the gun violence has gotten terrible in my city so events are scarce and tbh a little scary to go to but I'll keep my eyes out.

My experience from  decades of experience in dealing with similar individuals in a business environment is that many of those with modest lifestyles have lots of assets, few liabilities lots of liquidity and a credit score that reflects consistent fulfillment of their financial obligations.  Lots of those with high ticket cars ,  a love of the upscale clubs and \"living big\" have a miserable track record of meeting their obligations - either through lack of liquidity or lack of character.",

What I'm shocked about is the way that 2 years ago I had 4 great options with 4 fantastic potential sugar daddies, chose the one I vibed with best and kept him for the past 2 years. Now he travels too much and now that I'm back looking for another long term arrangement on the same site everyone's a fake or broke. I was able to get in contact with 1 of the guys from a couple years ago but he's since gotten married and is only interested in hiring by the hour (which is ofc fine as I also provide that service) but I just can't seem to find any options now like the ones I found previously abundant. They're even talking now about allowance 1/2 to 1/3 of what was normal conversation prior to 2 years ago (I've been on the site for 9 years on and off)",

Let's just say I'm shocked I haven't yet seen someone try and throw coins at the dancers in my city yet. I've been to a few wine tastings recently but all I met was a group of middle aged women (I go both ways but no vibes there) a group of women my age on a Bachelorette weekend, a group of married couples who were kind but obviously not that vibe and a staff member that offered to smoke me up on a blunt out back \ud83d\ude2d the bigger problem is the gun violence has gotten terrible in my city so events are scarce and tbh a little scary to go to but I'll keep my eyes out. I think I might just need to go the look hot as hell in a high end bar direction",

Lots of those with high ticket cars ,  a love of the upscale clubs and \"living big\" have a miserable track record of meeting their obligations - either through lack of liquidity or lack of character.",

In NY, if I earned $100, my standard of living would be below average.  In Mississippi, I would have an above average standard of living. \n\nRental housing shows the fallacy of your statement:  In Houston, where i am, I can get an average one bedrooom apartment of 750 square feet is about $1500.  In NYC, that apartment is over $3000.  That the NYC apartment costs more does not make it better:  It does mean that I have to make twice as much income to afford it.",
