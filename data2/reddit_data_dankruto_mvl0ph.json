Remember how she got stabbed by the Susanoo sword, and still broke it in half and hit Madara back with that same sword! And as she says to Madara, her being a woman doesn't matter, she has the most important characteristic of Hashirama, his Will of Fire.",

Those were Izuna's eyes, but they were freely gifted to Madara. I'll grant that he didn't have to fight for these eyes, but they were gifted because he put work into caring for his family. Plus, the only perk from EMS is that the eyes don't go blind when used, Madara didn't gain any new powers from them. Madara fought Hashirama on even footing at this point.  \n\nThen he unlocked Rinnegan using a bite he took out of Hashirama during their fight. Having Hashirama's cells alone wouldn't have unlocked Rinnegan, Madara had to combine Senju and Uchiha powers together to accomplish that. It took him fighting to the literal death, waking his corpse up with pre-programmed izanagi, implanting Hashirama's flesh into his own, and then years of additional work to unlock these eyes. Dude earned that power-up. \n\nThen he used Rinnegan to take sage jutsu from Hashirama's reanimated corpse after overpowering him. That's an earned power up as well. He didn't just copy someone, he had to use his earned ocular jutsu to acquire this extra chakra. He then managed to control it himself, without any training; that's a feat nobody else in the show pulled off. \n\nAs for the tailed beasts, Madara personally defeated each of them using his Limbo clones and Rinnegan. Then he became a jinchuriki using the newly reforged 10 tails. That's not something someone handed him, that's not something he copied; dude built a whole new tailed beast/tree and then ate it. If you manage to eat all 9 beasts, you've earned their power by just about any measure. \n\nWith the exception of Izuna's gifted eyes, Madara earned every single power-up through his own merit. He had lucky Uchiha genetics, sure; but he still had to experience trauma to unlock even basic sharingan. Everything else was hard work and experience.",

She and the rest of team 8 got dunked on during the second chunin exams arc in shippuden. Which I wasn't happy about since my rewatch of the series has made me appreciate shino more.  At best you can give her a win over one of Guren's crystal clones, but by that logic, Omoi has a stronger sword that Orichmaru as he could get through Naruto's KCM 1 cloak where Orichmaru with Kusangi couldn't get through Naruto's version 2 cloak.",

Not being a dick or anything, i legitimately recommend you check these series out. Jjk is a battle shonen, kyosogiga is a supernatural slice-of-life type series, mononoke is a supernatural slowburn, baccano is a chaotic train heist set in the early 1900s, and dororo is a samurai-era supernatural story that has a lot of genuinely touching moments. \n\nThe tokyo ghoul manga is also pretty good with non-sexualized women, as well. Claymore has an almost entirely female cast and it\u2019s about badass half-monster women using giant swords to kill monsters. I never watched the anime, but recently reread the manga on the SJ app. \n\nI get real turned off by fanservice and poorly written women, so those series are usually the ones i recommend people. Wish the list was longer.\n\nETA: dorohedoro is also a series full of badass women, but it does have a lot of nudity. The mangaka is a woman so it\u2019s not really....fanservicey, and almost all the girls are super fucking buff and strong (like arnold Schwarzenegger buff) and pivotal to the story. Just be warned, the story is insanely chaotic and gets really hard to follow.",

The way to I identify it is - \u2018does this add to the narrative, or could it be done a different way and still have the same effect, or does it add to a character in a way the expands who they are in a way that will be useful in the future\u2019.

Sure I get she's supposed to be fixated on Eren and woohoo she finally does something aside from it but come on. It took the entirety of the manga for Mikasa to do something other than \"Ereh\".

And not just in the \u201cthey just needed someone to love them\u201d sort of way, but in the \u201cwow, this world is so f*cked up and no one\u2019s done anything about it???\u201d way. Like how many orphans were picked up for some insane plot, yet only _ONE_ character thought to fix that or thought that system could be better (Kabuto)? Realizing the powers that be failed to put a system in place that actually protected people, and put it in such words. It was sometimes _implied_ (like the Hyuuga\u2019s clans issues and needing a leader with a spine), but not much else is actually done with it after. \n\nThe Mental Health hospital thing felt like a addition for something that wasn\u2019t obviously addressed in canon, if I\u2019m making sense. Like it was obviously needed, but Kishimoto didn\u2019t to put the seeds within the story to build it, and added it in after the fact. Like someone else had to remind him that it was a problem that needed to be solved instead of him remembering it was a problem the whole time? Like, who explicitly talks about mental health and what something like therapy could help in the Naruto verse prior to Boruto? Lots of talk about peace versus war, and love versus hate, but not talks of how much these traumatized people having the self awareness that what they have is trauma that didn\u2019t need to happen, or some other character was like \u201cwhat the help they needed could have looked like.\u201d I felt like those similar convos turned into Talk no Jutsu, and usually from just Naruto\u2019s mouth, rather than anyone else, which I feel kinda cheapens it because of how tired Naruto being the Dues Ex Machina with Talk no Jutsu is for me, and also because I don\u2019t think Naruto is nearly as empathetic about things as he could have been, which doesn\u2019t help that situation.\n\nI guess there was too much abstraction around it for my taste? Like, I seriously never expected that the Naruto universe would ever _explicitly_ address the need for mental health practices, to the point that I was genuinely so surprised it became a thing, if only in Boruto. It felt like fanon, really.\n\n Like, I\u2019m very much on the train that Konoha, and Hiruzen in particular failed their orphans in particular at every step possible, largely due to apathy. Like, having several traumatized children live on their own before they can even see over a countertop, and calling it a day at best. Kakashi is also another example - not _once_ did anyone think to let this kid be a kid instead of expecting him to be \u201cstiff upper lip\u201d soldier? Kushina and Minato were the closest people to do that, but the constant deaths he experienced should have had them pull him out of high-rankings to chill out and _be_ for a bit.",

Give me a minute, and I\u2019ll [link](https://twitter.com/uchihassasusaku/status/1309755815448936448?s=21) it. I had no idea how bad it was, and they apparently favor [Hinata](https://twitter.com/uchihassasusaku/status/1346291826236522496?s=21) so much they insert her in scenes she didn\u2019t originally appear in.\n\nSakura had so much good potential, and _it was so wasted._ It\u2019s a tragedy, and the more obvious example of how badly Team 7 in general is written, in my opinion. For a major character, she sure doesn\u2019t feel like one. You shouldn\u2019t have had to wait until Boruto to give more substance to her character. I love Shikamaru, but so many fans are using Boruto/Hiden content about him to try to retcon him as being closer to Naruto before Boruto than he actually was for no real reason, like he couldn\u2019t have been interesting without being \u201cNaruto\u2019s best friend\u201d first, or whatever, despite all his character arcs having near nothing to do with Naruto.",

Also let\u2019s them into a civilian life style - what a life away from being a ninja - can look like. No one else can give them that. I don\u2019t think every character needs a personal tragedy to develop and like each other - they just need some self awareness and empathy, which Sakura could have had. It also could have shown them how to love people that aren\u2019t blood, because while Sakura has a blood family, she loves them, too, as family and as friends and romantic.\nHer living situation is very different, it shouldn\u2019t need to reflect theirs for them to give a long. It\u2019s also more realistic that people with different backgrounds can still like and understand each other, and it\u2019s not like they came together _because_ they were the same. \nIt really helps take out the elistist feel out of the ninja core, especially with how many people come from ninja clans.\nShe was a bit of a spoiled, bratty kid who had to get a taste of the real world, and let go of her insecurities to befriend people she didn\u2019t initially like properly. That\u2019s pretty great and refreshing from the Lonely Orphan with Emotional Regulation Issues that is literally her entire team. _Because_ she didn\u2019t live such an extreme life, she can remind the rest that they don\u2019t always need extreme solutions to fix things, either. Team 7 loving them despite how different their backgrounds are feels more real to me than them merely liking her because their stories are identical. Makes it sound a bit narcissistic if the only value she has is being like them. It also lets her not become another clone and a properly independent character in the story.",

It\u2019s not a good thing, either. \n\nJapanese people also don\u2019t have a good work-life balance - particularly men - because of how much overwork is encouraged, and with the struggles to find a a decent paying job, many youths don\u2019t want family because of how poor their own family was due to work, they don\u2019t trust the work force with their peer pressure issues and overwork issues, and because they can\u2019t work enough to pay for themselves, nevermind support a family. \n\nKishimoto ended up embodying all the bad things of Japanese work-life balance when he didn\u2019t need to. \n\nThere was no reason that the women of Naruto couldn\u2019t have a job and still be there for their kids. It\u2019s totally possible, but Kishimoto focused more on them being housewives first without acknowledging their own jobs outside the home, despite the fact that we see the men at their jobs first and more often then we see them with their kids. I think Sai and Shikamaru are one of the few to have good domestic scenes with their kids, and we know Shikamaru still has an important job. No reason why the women couldn\u2019t get the same courtesy.",

The simple fact that she lives in Konoha serves as a diplomatic link to Sunagakure. \n\nSocieties aren\u2019t just built by engineers, lawyers and politicians. They are built by mothers and fathers just as much, if not more. Temari is still a ninja, if she\u2019s ever needed as a ninja the village can request her aid. I really think you\u2019re making a mountain out of a mole hill here, she seems to be quite happy with the role she chose, and she clearly wears the pants in her relationship, so I highly doubt that Shikamaru ever forced her into being a homemaker.",

From Sasuke Shinden, Hinata was already married and still worked, presumably until Naruto became hokage. From the Shikamaru Novel, Shikamaru is so busy that he forgot their wedding aniversary, so I would guess that Temari became a housewife to compensate for Shika's lack of parenting.",

It's why Itachi couldn't be beaten by anyone other than Sasuke for the story to make sense. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI agree that Hinata should have been killed off, she literally has no wins in the series, is a worse version of sakura as she has no independent moments, is weaker than 13 year old Neji, and is the fakest person in the series. I'm sorry, but you can't just come in and say you always loved and supported a guy even no one else did. I don't recall seeing her bitch ass buying Naruto a bowl of Ramen when he was starving, being  one of a handful of people to not treat Naruto like dirt, and et cetera. I'm pretty sure Future was inspired to write Where Ya At, because of Hinata's fake ass.",

Sarada remarked, \"oh how lovely a youmg female leader!\" And then the scientist said \"but she's weird. You'll see.\" As if he's not? As if its not the case that everyone is weird in their own ways? Telling Sarada you can't be a female leader if you're not weird? I was so mad. That one line was like completely invalidating her accomplishments, and it was like the writer wanted to remind people that women can't be in powerful positions unless men put them there. And that they can take it away too. \n\nI might be reading into it but man that hurt. Watch the scene first before you argue with me.",

The main running gag for any female with a job is \u201cyou\u2019ll never get a husband because xyz\u201d. Female characters quitting their jobs with male characters becoming the sole breadwinner and then hardly interacting with their kids. If you wonder why the suicide rate in Japan is so high and the birthrate is so low it\u2019s because they can\u2019t take it anymore. Imagine the moment you get married to your coworker she quits immediately and you now have to make 3 times as much money for absolutely no reason other than societal pressure. Now imagine you went to school and studied hard, you worked very hard to further your career into something you can be proud of, but now because you got married people are going to talk about you behind your back and assume there\u2019s something wrong with you if you don\u2019t throw it all away to become a housewife",

This is even less negligible that ninjas exams are based on chakra utilization, not human strength utilization.\n\nBut even if we base ourself in physical strength, aren\u2019t females as strong, if this is not even more than males in Naruto ?

I'll grant that he didn't have to fight for these eyes, but they were gifted because he put work into caring for his family. Plus, the only perk from EMS is that the eyes don't go blind when used, Madara didn't gain any new powers from them. Madara fought Hashirama on even footing at this point.  \n\nThen he unlocked Rinnegan using a bite he took out of Hashirama during their fight. Having Hashirama's cells alone wouldn't have unlocked Rinnegan, Madara had to combine Senju and Uchiha powers together to accomplish that. It took him fighting to the literal death, waking his corpse up with pre-programmed izanagi, implanting Hashirama's flesh into his own, and then years of additional work to unlock these eyes. Dude earned that power-up. \n\nThen he used Rinnegan to take sage jutsu from Hashirama's reanimated corpse after overpowering him. That's an earned power up as well. He didn't just copy someone, he had to use his earned ocular jutsu to acquire this extra chakra. He then managed to control it himself, without any training; that's a feat nobody else in the show pulled off. \n\nAs for the tailed beasts, Madara personally defeated each of them using his Limbo clones and Rinnegan. Then he became a jinchuriki using the newly reforged 10 tails. That's not something someone handed him, that's not something he copied; dude built a whole new tailed beast/tree and then ate it. If you manage to eat all 9 beasts, you've earned their power by just about any measure. \n\nWith the exception of Izuna's gifted eyes, Madara earned every single power-up through his own merit. He had lucky Uchiha genetics, sure; but he still had to experience trauma to unlock even basic sharingan. Everything else was hard work and experience.",

For God's sake she doesn't even have a single win under her belt even if you hate Sakura and downplay her feats she did beat several anime and movie enemies by her self and was not a burden in the fight against Sasori, outsmarted a zetsu which multiple jonin couldn't, outsmarted Sai, and she did better than Kakashi against Madara and Kaguya until Obito posessed him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven with filler, Hinata has no wins against an enemy.  She and the rest of team 8 got dunked on during the second chunin exams arc in shippuden. Which I wasn't happy about since my rewatch of the series has made me appreciate shino more.  At best you can give her a win over one of Guren's crystal clones, but by that logic, Omoi has a stronger sword that Orichmaru as he could get through Naruto's KCM 1 cloak where Orichmaru with Kusangi couldn't get through Naruto's version 2 cloak.",

I didn't like Sakura not because shes \"useless\" i hate her for talking about morals and hesitate during a war when shes taught to be an important figure during a crisis since shes a world class healer 2nd to Tsunade supposedly. But aside from that I think Kishi made her character arc so roller coaster that I lost interest eventually",

I wanted a fight that reflects on young helpless sakura to now shes a disciple of a sanin. People thinking shes just a healer and last line of defense.

Not being a dick or anything, i legitimately recommend you check these series out. Jjk is a battle shonen, kyosogiga is a supernatural slice-of-life type series, mononoke is a supernatural slowburn, baccano is a chaotic train heist set in the early 1900s, and dororo is a samurai-era supernatural story that has a lot of genuinely touching moments. \n\nThe tokyo ghoul manga is also pretty good with non-sexualized women, as well. Claymore has an almost entirely female cast and it\u2019s about badass half-monster women using giant swords to kill monsters. I never watched the anime, but recently reread the manga on the SJ app. \n\nI get real turned off by fanservice and poorly written women, so those series are usually the ones i recommend people. Wish the list was longer.\n\nETA: dorohedoro is also a series full of badass women, but it does have a lot of nudity. The mangaka is a woman so it\u2019s not really....fanservicey, and almost all the girls are super fucking buff and strong (like arnold Schwarzenegger buff) and pivotal to the story. Just be warned, the story is insanely chaotic and gets really hard to follow.",

The way to I identify it is - \u2018does this add to the narrative, or could it be done a different way and still have the same effect, or does it add to a character in a way the expands who they are in a way that will be useful in the future\u2019.

You have all these amazing characters. Some of the most complex and interesting characters in all of anime and you focus the ending almost entirely on the one character that's more vanilla than vanilla itself. Sure I get she's supposed to be fixated on Eren and woohoo she finally does something aside from it but come on. It took the entirety of the manga for Mikasa to do something other than \"Ereh\". Everything else about the ending is great tho imo.!<",

And not just in the \u201cthey just needed someone to love them\u201d sort of way, but in the \u201cwow, this world is so f*cked up and no one\u2019s done anything about it???\u201d way. Like how many orphans were picked up for some insane plot, yet only _ONE_ character thought to fix that or thought that system could be better (Kabuto)? Realizing the powers that be failed to put a system in place that actually protected people, and put it in such words. It was sometimes _implied_ (like the Hyuuga\u2019s clans issues and needing a leader with a spine), but not much else is actually done with it after. \n\nThe Mental Health hospital thing felt like a addition for something that wasn\u2019t obviously addressed in canon, if I\u2019m making sense. Like it was obviously needed, but Kishimoto didn\u2019t to put the seeds within the story to build it, and added it in after the fact. Like someone else had to remind him that it was a problem that needed to be solved instead of him remembering it was a problem the whole time? Like, who explicitly talks about mental health and what something like therapy could help in the Naruto verse prior to Boruto? Lots of talk about peace versus war, and love versus hate, but not talks of how much these traumatized people having the self awareness that what they have is trauma that didn\u2019t need to happen, or some other character was like \u201cwhat the help they needed could have looked like.\u201d I felt like those similar convos turned into Talk no Jutsu, and usually from just Naruto\u2019s mouth, rather than anyone else, which I feel kinda cheapens it because of how tired Naruto being the Dues Ex Machina with Talk no Jutsu is for me, and also because I don\u2019t think Naruto is nearly as empathetic about things as he could have been, which doesn\u2019t help that situation.\n\nI guess there was too much abstraction around it for my taste? Like, I seriously never expected that the Naruto universe would ever _explicitly_ address the need for mental health practices, to the point that I was genuinely so surprised it became a thing, if only in Boruto. It felt like fanon, really.\n\n Like, I\u2019m very much on the train that Konoha, and Hiruzen in particular failed their orphans in particular at every step possible, largely due to apathy. Like, having several traumatized children live on their own before they can even see over a countertop, and calling it a day at best. Kakashi is also another example - not _once_ did anyone think to let this kid be a kid instead of expecting him to be \u201cstiff upper lip\u201d soldier? Kushina and Minato were the closest people to do that, but the constant deaths he experienced should have had them pull him out of high-rankings to chill out and _be_ for a bit.",

For a major character, she sure doesn\u2019t feel like one. You shouldn\u2019t have had to wait until Boruto to give more substance to her character. I love Shikamaru, but so many fans are using Boruto/Hiden content about him to try to retcon him as being closer to Naruto before Boruto than he actually was for no real reason, like he couldn\u2019t have been interesting without being \u201cNaruto\u2019s best friend\u201d first, or whatever, despite all his character arcs having near nothing to do with Naruto.",

They would all be orphans then and would all have a family type bond that none of the other teams really have.

Also let\u2019s them into a civilian life style - what a life away from being a ninja - can look like. No one else can give them that. I don\u2019t think every character needs a personal tragedy to develop and like each other - they just need some self awareness and empathy, which Sakura could have had. It also could have shown them how to love people that aren\u2019t blood, because while Sakura has a blood family, she loves them, too, as family and as friends and romantic.\nHer living situation is very different, it shouldn\u2019t need to reflect theirs for them to give a long. It\u2019s also more realistic that people with different backgrounds can still like and understand each other, and it\u2019s not like they came together _because_ they were the same. \nIt really helps take out the elistist feel out of the ninja core, especially with how many people come from ninja clans.\nShe was a bit of a spoiled, bratty kid who had to get a taste of the real world, and let go of her insecurities to befriend people she didn\u2019t initially like properly. That\u2019s pretty great and refreshing from the Lonely Orphan with Emotional Regulation Issues that is literally her entire team. _Because_ she didn\u2019t live such an extreme life, she can remind the rest that they don\u2019t always need extreme solutions to fix things, either. Team 7 loving them despite how different their backgrounds are feels more real to me than them merely liking her because their stories are identical. Makes it sound a bit narcissistic if the only value she has is being like them. It also lets her not become another clone and a properly independent character in the story.",

It\u2019s not a good thing, either. \n\nJapanese people also don\u2019t have a good work-life balance - particularly men - because of how much overwork is encouraged, and with the struggles to find a a decent paying job, many youths don\u2019t want family because of how poor their own family was due to work, they don\u2019t trust the work force with their peer pressure issues and overwork issues, and because they can\u2019t work enough to pay for themselves, nevermind support a family. \n\nKishimoto ended up embodying all the bad things of Japanese work-life balance when he didn\u2019t need to. \n\nThere was no reason that the women of Naruto couldn\u2019t have a job and still be there for their kids. It\u2019s totally possible, but Kishimoto focused more on them being housewives first without acknowledging their own jobs outside the home, despite the fact that we see the men at their jobs first and more often then we see them with their kids. I think Sai and Shikamaru are one of the few to have good domestic scenes with their kids, and we know Shikamaru still has an important job. No reason why the women couldn\u2019t get the same courtesy.",

The simple fact that she lives in Konoha serves as a diplomatic link to Sunagakure. \n\nSocieties aren\u2019t just built by engineers, lawyers and politicians.

He wasn\u2019t thinking \u201cWell, I can\u2019t have this WOMAN doing a MAN\u2019s job and thinking she can have a CAREER or something, she BELONGS in the kitchen and changing diapers!!!\u201d, though that seems to be your head canon.You\u2019re the one making the sexist insinuation that women who chose to be housewives are somehow lesser or that they lack ambition, which is complete and utter bullshit. My mother used to be a banker and made really good money, and then she decided to get married and have kids, at which point she chose to quit her job and become a stay-at-home mom. This is a choice millions of women make at some point of their lives, and just because it\u2019s a choice you don\u2019t personally like doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the \u201cwrong\u201d choice. And guess what? Being a good homemaker is a HARD fucking job that requires a full time commitment, and unlike a \u201ccareer job\u201d, if you fail at it you do so at the direct detriment of your family.\n\nI mean from what I can tell, all the girls that become housewifes are after Naruto became Hokage. From Sasuke Shinden, Hinata was already married and still worked, presumably until Naruto became hokage. From the Shikamaru Novel, Shikamaru is so busy that he forgot their wedding aniversary, so I would guess that Temari became a housewife to compensate for Shika's lack of parenting.",

I'm sorry, but you can't just come in and say you always loved and supported a guy even no one else did.

This is even less negligible that ninjas exams are based on chakra utilization, not human strength utilization.\n\nBut even if we base ourself in physical strength, aren\u2019t females as strong, if this is not even more than males in Naruto ?

I'll grant that he didn't have to fight for these eyes, but they were gifted because he put work into caring for his family. Plus, the only perk from EMS is that the eyes don't go blind when used, Madara didn't gain any new powers from them. Madara fought Hashirama on even footing at this point.  \n\nThen he unlocked Rinnegan using a bite he took out of Hashirama during their fight. Having Hashirama's cells alone wouldn't have unlocked Rinnegan, Madara had to combine Senju and Uchiha powers together to accomplish that. It took him fighting to the literal death, waking his corpse up with pre-programmed izanagi, implanting Hashirama's flesh into his own, and then years of additional work to unlock these eyes. Dude earned that power-up. \n\nThen he used Rinnegan to take sage jutsu from Hashirama's reanimated corpse after overpowering him. That's an earned power up as well. He didn't just copy someone, he had to use his earned ocular jutsu to acquire this extra chakra. He then managed to control it himself, without any training; that's a feat nobody else in the show pulled off. \n\nAs for the tailed beasts, Madara personally defeated each of them using his Limbo clones and Rinnegan. Then he became a jinchuriki using the newly reforged 10 tails. That's not something someone handed him, that's not something he copied; dude built a whole new tailed beast/tree and then ate it. If you manage to eat all 9 beasts, you've earned their power by just about any measure. \n\nWith the exception of Izuna's gifted eyes, Madara earned every single power-up through his own merit. He had lucky Uchiha genetics, sure; but he still had to experience trauma to unlock even basic sharingan. Everything else was hard work and experience.",

She and the rest of team 8 got dunked on during the second chunin exams arc in shippuden. Which I wasn't happy about since my rewatch of the series has made me appreciate shino more.

Jjk is a battle shonen, kyosogiga is a supernatural slice-of-life type series, mononoke is a supernatural slowburn, baccano is a chaotic train heist set in the early 1900s, and dororo is a samurai-era supernatural story that has a lot of genuinely touching moments. \n\nThe tokyo ghoul manga is also pretty good with non-sexualized women, as well. Claymore has an almost entirely female cast and it\u2019s about badass half-monster women using giant swords to kill monsters. I never watched the anime, but recently reread the manga on the SJ app. \n\nI get real turned off by fanservice and poorly written women, so those series are usually the ones i recommend people. Wish the list was longer.\n\nETA: dorohedoro is also a series full of badass women, but it does have a lot of nudity. The mangaka is a woman so it\u2019s not really....fanservicey, and almost all the girls are super fucking buff and strong (like arnold Schwarzenegger buff) and pivotal to the story. Just be warned, the story is insanely chaotic and gets really hard to follow.",

Like how many orphans were picked up for some insane plot, yet only _ONE_ character thought to fix that or thought that system could be better (Kabuto)? Realizing the powers that be failed to put a system in place that actually protected people, and put it in such words. It was sometimes _implied_ (like the Hyuuga\u2019s clans issues and needing a leader with a spine), but not much else is actually done with it after. \n\nThe Mental Health hospital thing felt like a addition for something that wasn\u2019t obviously addressed in canon, if I\u2019m making sense. Like it was obviously needed, but Kishimoto didn\u2019t to put the seeds within the story to build it, and added it in after the fact. Like someone else had to remind him that it was a problem that needed to be solved instead of him remembering it was a problem the whole time? Like, who explicitly talks about mental health and what something like therapy could help in the Naruto verse prior to Boruto? Lots of talk about peace versus war, and love versus hate, but not talks of how much these traumatized people having the self awareness that what they have is trauma that didn\u2019t need to happen, or some other character was like \u201cwhat the help they needed could have looked like.\u201d I felt like those similar convos turned into Talk no Jutsu, and usually from just Naruto\u2019s mouth, rather than anyone else, which I feel kinda cheapens it because of how tired Naruto being the Dues Ex Machina with Talk no Jutsu is for me, and also because I don\u2019t think Naruto is nearly as empathetic about things as he could have been, which doesn\u2019t help that situation.\n\nI guess there was too much abstraction around it for my taste? Like, I seriously never expected that the Naruto universe would ever _explicitly_ address the need for mental health practices, to the point that I was genuinely so surprised it became a thing, if only in Boruto. It felt like fanon, really.\n\n Like, I\u2019m very much on the train that Konoha, and Hiruzen in particular failed their orphans in particular at every step possible, largely due to apathy. Like, having several traumatized children live on their own before they can even see over a countertop, and calling it a day at best. Kakashi is also another example - not _once_ did anyone think to let this kid be a kid instead of expecting him to be \u201cstiff upper lip\u201d soldier? Kushina and Minato were the closest people to do that, but the constant deaths he experienced should have had them pull him out of high-rankings to chill out and _be_ for a bit.",

I love Shikamaru, but so many fans are using Boruto/Hiden content about him to try to retcon him as being closer to Naruto before Boruto than he actually was for no real reason, like he couldn\u2019t have been interesting without being \u201cNaruto\u2019s best friend\u201d first, or whatever, despite all his character arcs having near nothing to do with Naruto.",

Also let\u2019s them into a civilian life style - what a life away from being a ninja - can look like. No one else can give them that. I don\u2019t think every character needs a personal tragedy to develop and like each other - they just need some self awareness and empathy, which Sakura could have had. It also could have shown them how to love people that aren\u2019t blood, because while Sakura has a blood family, she loves them, too, as family and as friends and romantic.\nHer living situation is very different, it shouldn\u2019t need to reflect theirs for them to give a long. It\u2019s also more realistic that people with different backgrounds can still like and understand each other, and it\u2019s not like they came together _because_ they were the same. \nIt really helps take out the elistist feel out of the ninja core, especially with how many people come from ninja clans.\nShe was a bit of a spoiled, bratty kid who had to get a taste of the real world, and let go of her insecurities to befriend people she didn\u2019t initially like properly. That\u2019s pretty great and refreshing from the Lonely Orphan with Emotional Regulation Issues that is literally her entire team. _Because_ she didn\u2019t live such an extreme life, she can remind the rest that they don\u2019t always need extreme solutions to fix things, either. Team 7 loving them despite how different their backgrounds are feels more real to me than them merely liking her because their stories are identical. Makes it sound a bit narcissistic if the only value she has is being like them. It also lets her not become another clone and a properly independent character in the story.",

It\u2019s not a good thing, either. \n\nJapanese people also don\u2019t have a good work-life balance - particularly men - because of how much overwork is encouraged, and with the struggles to find a a decent paying job, many youths don\u2019t want family because of how poor their own family was due to work, they don\u2019t trust the work force with their peer pressure issues and overwork issues, and because they can\u2019t work enough to pay for themselves, nevermind support a family. \n\nKishimoto ended up embodying all the bad things of Japanese work-life balance when he didn\u2019t need to. \n\nThere was no reason that the women of Naruto couldn\u2019t have a job and still be there for their kids. It\u2019s totally possible, but Kishimoto focused more on them being housewives first without acknowledging their own jobs outside the home, despite the fact that we see the men at their jobs first and more often then we see them with their kids. I think Sai and Shikamaru are one of the few to have good domestic scenes with their kids, and we know Shikamaru still has an important job. No reason why the women couldn\u2019t get the same courtesy.",

Shikamaru already has a high-profile job that likely pays the bills quite comfortably, plus he\u2019s the head of the Nara clan. The simple fact that she lives in Konoha serves as a diplomatic link to Sunagakure. \n\nSocieties aren\u2019t just built by engineers, lawyers and politicians. They are built by mothers and fathers just as much, if not more. Temari is still a ninja, if she\u2019s ever needed as a ninja the village can request her aid. I really think you\u2019re making a mountain out of a mole hill here, she seems to be quite happy with the role she chose, and she clearly wears the pants in her relationship, so I highly doubt that Shikamaru ever forced her into being a homemaker.",

From Sasuke Shinden, Hinata was already married and still worked, presumably until Naruto became hokage. From the Shikamaru Novel, Shikamaru is so busy that he forgot their wedding aniversary, so I would guess that Temari became a housewife to compensate for Shika's lack of parenting.",

This is even less negligible that ninjas exams are based on chakra utilization, not human strength utilization.\n\nBut even if we base ourself in physical strength, aren\u2019t females as strong, if this is not even more than males in Naruto ?

                    "body": "Dude went toe-to-toe against Hashirama using just his Eternal Mangyekyou Sharingan. Those were Izuna's eyes, but they were freely gifted to Madara. I'll grant that he didn't have to fight for these eyes, but they were gifted because he put work into caring for his family. Plus, the only perk from EMS is that the eyes don't go blind when used, Madara didn't gain any new powers from them. Madara fought Hashirama on even footing at this point.  \n\nThen he unlocked Rinnegan using a bite he took out of Hashirama during their fight. Having Hashirama's cells alone wouldn't have unlocked Rinnegan, Madara had to combine Senju and Uchiha powers together to accomplish that. It took him fighting to the literal death, waking his corpse up with pre-programmed izanagi, implanting Hashirama's flesh into his own, and then years of additional work to unlock these eyes. Dude earned that power-up. \n\nThen he used Rinnegan to take sage jutsu from Hashirama's reanimated corpse after overpowering him. That's an earned power up as well. He didn't just copy someone, he had to use his earned ocular jutsu to acquire this extra chakra. He then managed to control it himself, without any training; that's a feat nobody else in the show pulled off. \n\nAs for the tailed beasts, Madara personally defeated each of them using his Limbo clones and Rinnegan. Then he became a jinchuriki using the newly reforged 10 tails. That's not something someone handed him, that's not something he copied; dude built a whole new tailed beast/tree and then ate it. If you manage to eat all 9 beasts, you've earned their power by just about any measure. \n\nWith the exception of Izuna's gifted eyes, Madara earned every single power-up through his own merit. He had lucky Uchiha genetics, sure; but he still had to experience trauma to unlock even basic sharingan. Everything else was hard work and experience.",

For God's sake she doesn't even have a single win under her belt even if you hate Sakura and downplay her feats she did beat several anime and movie enemies by her self and was not a burden in the fight against Sasori, outsmarted a zetsu which multiple jonin couldn't, outsmarted Sai, and she did better than Kakashi against Madara and Kaguya until Obito posessed him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven with filler, Hinata has no wins against an enemy.  She and the rest of team 8 got dunked on during the second chunin exams arc in shippuden. Which I wasn't happy about since my rewatch of the series has made me appreciate shino more.  At best you can give her a win over one of Guren's crystal clones, but by that logic, Omoi has a stronger sword that Orichmaru as he could get through Naruto's KCM 1 cloak where Orichmaru with Kusangi couldn't get through Naruto's version 2 cloak.",

Jjk is a battle shonen, kyosogiga is a supernatural slice-of-life type series, mononoke is a supernatural slowburn, baccano is a chaotic train heist set in the early 1900s, and dororo is a samurai-era supernatural story that has a lot of genuinely touching moments. \n\nThe tokyo ghoul manga is also pretty good with non-sexualized women, as well. Claymore has an almost entirely female cast and it\u2019s about badass half-monster women using giant swords to kill monsters. I never watched the anime, but recently reread the manga on the SJ app. \n\nI get real turned off by fanservice and poorly written women, so those series are usually the ones i recommend people. Wish the list was longer.\n\nETA: dorohedoro is also a series full of badass women, but it does have a lot of nudity. The mangaka is a woman so it\u2019s not really....fanservicey, and almost all the girls are super fucking buff and strong (like arnold Schwarzenegger buff) and pivotal to the story.

And not just in the \u201cthey just needed someone to love them\u201d sort of way, but in the \u201cwow, this world is so f*cked up and no one\u2019s done anything about it???\u201d way. Like how many orphans were picked up for some insane plot, yet only _ONE_ character thought to fix that or thought that system could be better (Kabuto)? Realizing the powers that be failed to put a system in place that actually protected people, and put it in such words. It was sometimes _implied_ (like the Hyuuga\u2019s clans issues and needing a leader with a spine), but not much else is actually done with it after. \n\nThe Mental Health hospital thing felt like a addition for something that wasn\u2019t obviously addressed in canon, if I\u2019m making sense. Like it was obviously needed, but Kishimoto didn\u2019t to put the seeds within the story to build it, and added it in after the fact. Like someone else had to remind him that it was a problem that needed to be solved instead of him remembering it was a problem the whole time? Like, who explicitly talks about mental health and what something like therapy could help in the Naruto verse prior to Boruto? Lots of talk about peace versus war, and love versus hate, but not talks of how much these traumatized people having the self awareness that what they have is trauma that didn\u2019t need to happen, or some other character was like \u201cwhat the help they needed could have looked like.\u201d I felt like those similar convos turned into Talk no Jutsu, and usually from just Naruto\u2019s mouth, rather than anyone else, which I feel kinda cheapens it because of how tired Naruto being the Dues Ex Machina with Talk no Jutsu is for me, and also because I don\u2019t think Naruto is nearly as empathetic about things as he could have been, which doesn\u2019t help that situation.\n\nI guess there was too much abstraction around it for my taste? Like, I seriously never expected that the Naruto universe would ever _explicitly_ address the need for mental health practices, to the point that I was genuinely so surprised it became a thing, if only in Boruto. It felt like fanon, really.\n\n Like, I\u2019m very much on the train that Konoha, and Hiruzen in particular failed their orphans in particular at every step possible, largely due to apathy. Like, having several traumatized children live on their own before they can even see over a countertop, and calling it a day at best. Kakashi is also another example - not _once_ did anyone think to let this kid be a kid instead of expecting him to be \u201cstiff upper lip\u201d soldier? Kushina and Minato were the closest people to do that, but the constant deaths he experienced should have had them pull him out of high-rankings to chill out and _be_ for a bit.",

For a major character, she sure doesn\u2019t feel like one. You shouldn\u2019t have had to wait until Boruto to give more substance to her character. I love Shikamaru, but so many fans are using Boruto/Hiden content about him to try to retcon him as being closer to Naruto before Boruto than he actually was for no real reason, like he couldn\u2019t have been interesting without being \u201cNaruto\u2019s best friend\u201d first, or whatever, despite all his character arcs having near nothing to do with Naruto.",

I don\u2019t think every character needs a personal tragedy to develop and like each other - they just need some self awareness and empathy, which Sakura could have had. It also could have shown them how to love people that aren\u2019t blood, because while Sakura has a blood family, she loves them, too, as family and as friends and romantic.\nHer living situation is very different, it shouldn\u2019t need to reflect theirs for them to give a long. It\u2019s also more realistic that people with different backgrounds can still like and understand each other, and it\u2019s not like they came together _because_ they were the same. \nIt really helps take out the elistist feel out of the ninja core, especially with how many people come from ninja clans.\nShe was a bit of a spoiled, bratty kid who had to get a taste of the real world, and let go of her insecurities to befriend people she didn\u2019t initially like properly. That\u2019s pretty great and refreshing from the Lonely Orphan with Emotional Regulation Issues that is literally her entire team. _Because_ she didn\u2019t live such an extreme life, she can remind the rest that they don\u2019t always need extreme solutions to fix things, either. Team 7 loving them despite how different their backgrounds are feels more real to me than them merely liking her because their stories are identical. Makes it sound a bit narcissistic if the only value she has is being like them. It also lets her not become another clone and a properly independent character in the story.",

It\u2019s not a good thing, either. \n\nJapanese people also don\u2019t have a good work-life balance - particularly men - because of how much overwork is encouraged, and with the struggles to find a a decent paying job, many youths don\u2019t want family because of how poor their own family was due to work, they don\u2019t trust the work force with their peer pressure issues and overwork issues, and because they can\u2019t work enough to pay for themselves, nevermind support a family. \n\nKishimoto ended up embodying all the bad things of Japanese work-life balance when he didn\u2019t need to. \n\nThere was no reason that the women of Naruto couldn\u2019t have a job and still be there for their kids. It\u2019s totally possible, but Kishimoto focused more on them being housewives first without acknowledging their own jobs outside the home, despite the fact that we see the men at their jobs first and more often then we see them with their kids. I think Sai and Shikamaru are one of the few to have good domestic scenes with their kids, and we know Shikamaru still has an important job. No reason why the women couldn\u2019t get the same courtesy.",

He wasn\u2019t thinking \u201cWell, I can\u2019t have this WOMAN doing a MAN\u2019s job and thinking she can have a CAREER or something, she BELONGS in the kitchen and changing diapers!!!\u201d, though that seems to be your head canon.You\u2019re the one making the sexist insinuation that women who chose to be housewives are somehow lesser or that they lack ambition, which is complete and utter bullshit. My mother used to be a banker and made really good money, and then she decided to get married and have kids, at which point she chose to quit her job and become a stay-at-home mom. This is a choice millions of women make at some point of their lives, and just because it\u2019s a choice you don\u2019t personally like doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the \u201cwrong\u201d choice. And guess what? Being a good homemaker is a HARD fucking job that requires a full time commitment, and unlike a \u201ccareer job\u201d, if you fail at it you do so at the direct detriment of your family.\n\nI mean from what I can tell, all the girls that become housewifes are after Naruto became Hokage. From Sasuke Shinden, Hinata was already married and still worked, presumably until Naruto became hokage. From the Shikamaru Novel, Shikamaru is so busy that he forgot their wedding aniversary, so I would guess that Temari became a housewife to compensate for Shika's lack of parenting.",

I'm sorry, but you can't just come in and say you always loved and supported a guy even no one else did. I don't recall seeing her bitch ass buying Naruto a bowl of Ramen when he was starving, being  one of a handful of people to not treat Naruto like dirt, and et cetera. I'm pretty sure Future was inspired to write Where Ya At, because of Hinata's fake ass.",

If you are interested in mines :\n\nhttps://www.lawfareblog.com/female-service-idf-challenge-integrated-army\n\nhttps://www.google.fr/amp/s/www.haaretz.com/amp/opinion/.premium-women-just-aren-t-cut-out-for-combat-roles-1.5730157\n\nSecondly the military had to lower the standards because of the difference of strength between male and females, that is NOT a thing in Naruto. \n\nNot only because Chakra can\u2019t be negligible as you say because ninjas use most chakra than anything, but almost no physical strength. This is even less negligible that ninjas exams are based on chakra utilization, not human strength utilization.\n\nBut even if we base ourself in physical strength, aren\u2019t females as strong, if this is not even more than males in Naruto ? Sakura and Tsunade can literally break the ground with their bare hands.",

I understand it may have been retconned at the last minute for plot, but apparently Madara just wanted to test out his Rinnegan hypothesis (Black zetsus master plan). Apparently his plan was to fake his death with Izanagi, and have Zetsu retrieve him and his newly acquired chunk of flesh to be experimented with. He succeeded. \n\n> no chance of being a successful villain without them \n\nKinda irrelevant?",

I'll grant that he didn't have to fight for these eyes, but they were gifted because he put work into caring for his family. Plus, the only perk from EMS is that the eyes don't go blind when used, Madara didn't gain any new powers from them. Madara fought Hashirama on even footing at this point.  \n\nThen he unlocked Rinnegan using a bite he took out of Hashirama during their fight. Having Hashirama's cells alone wouldn't have unlocked Rinnegan, Madara had to combine Senju and Uchiha powers together to accomplish that. It took him fighting to the literal death, waking his corpse up with pre-programmed izanagi, implanting Hashirama's flesh into his own, and then years of additional work to unlock these eyes. Dude earned that power-up. \n\nThen he used Rinnegan to take sage jutsu from Hashirama's reanimated corpse after overpowering him. That's an earned power up as well. He didn't just copy someone, he had to use his earned ocular jutsu to acquire this extra chakra. He then managed to control it himself, without any training; that's a feat nobody else in the show pulled off. \n\nAs for the tailed beasts, Madara personally defeated each of them using his Limbo clones and Rinnegan. Then he became a jinchuriki using the newly reforged 10 tails. That's not something someone handed him, that's not something he copied; dude built a whole new tailed beast/tree and then ate it. If you manage to eat all 9 beasts, you've earned their power by just about any measure. \n\nWith the exception of Izuna's gifted eyes, Madara earned every single power-up through his own merit. He had lucky Uchiha genetics, sure; but he still had to experience trauma to unlock even basic sharingan. Everything else was hard work and experience.",

She and the rest of team 8 got dunked on during the second chunin exams arc in shippuden. Which I wasn't happy about since my rewatch of the series has made me appreciate shino more.  At best you can give her a win over one of Guren's crystal clones, but by that logic, Omoi has a stronger sword that Orichmaru as he could get through Naruto's KCM 1 cloak where Orichmaru with Kusangi couldn't get through Naruto's version 2 cloak.",

And not just in the \u201cthey just needed someone to love them\u201d sort of way, but in the \u201cwow, this world is so f*cked up and no one\u2019s done anything about it???\u201d way. Like how many orphans were picked up for some insane plot, yet only _ONE_ character thought to fix that or thought that system could be better (Kabuto)? Realizing the powers that be failed to put a system in place that actually protected people, and put it in such words. It was sometimes _implied_ (like the Hyuuga\u2019s clans issues and needing a leader with a spine), but not much else is actually done with it after. \n\nThe Mental Health hospital thing felt like a addition for something that wasn\u2019t obviously addressed in canon, if I\u2019m making sense. Like it was obviously needed, but Kishimoto didn\u2019t to put the seeds within the story to build it, and added it in after the fact. Like someone else had to remind him that it was a problem that needed to be solved instead of him remembering it was a problem the whole time? Like, who explicitly talks about mental health and what something like therapy could help in the Naruto verse prior to Boruto? Lots of talk about peace versus war, and love versus hate, but not talks of how much these traumatized people having the self awareness that what they have is trauma that didn\u2019t need to happen, or some other character was like \u201cwhat the help they needed could have looked like.\u201d I felt like those similar convos turned into Talk no Jutsu, and usually from just Naruto\u2019s mouth, rather than anyone else, which I feel kinda cheapens it because of how tired Naruto being the Dues Ex Machina with Talk no Jutsu is for me, and also because I don\u2019t think Naruto is nearly as empathetic about things as he could have been, which doesn\u2019t help that situation.\n\nI guess there was too much abstraction around it for my taste? Like, I seriously never expected that the Naruto universe would ever _explicitly_ address the need for mental health practices, to the point that I was genuinely so surprised it became a thing, if only in Boruto. It felt like fanon, really.\n\n Like, I\u2019m very much on the train that Konoha, and Hiruzen in particular failed their orphans in particular at every step possible, largely due to apathy. Like, having several traumatized children live on their own before they can even see over a countertop, and calling it a day at best. Kakashi is also another example - not _once_ did anyone think to let this kid be a kid instead of expecting him to be \u201cstiff upper lip\u201d soldier? Kushina and Minato were the closest people to do that, but the constant deaths he experienced should have had them pull him out of high-rankings to chill out and _be_ for a bit.",

For a major character, she sure doesn\u2019t feel like one. You shouldn\u2019t have had to wait until Boruto to give more substance to her character. I love Shikamaru, but so many fans are using Boruto/Hiden content about him to try to retcon him as being closer to Naruto before Boruto than he actually was for no real reason, like he couldn\u2019t have been interesting without being \u201cNaruto\u2019s best friend\u201d first, or whatever, despite all his character arcs having near nothing to do with Naruto.",

Also let\u2019s them into a civilian life style - what a life away from being a ninja - can look like. No one else can give them that. I don\u2019t think every character needs a personal tragedy to develop and like each other - they just need some self awareness and empathy, which Sakura could have had. It also could have shown them how to love people that aren\u2019t blood, because while Sakura has a blood family, she loves them, too, as family and as friends and romantic.\nHer living situation is very different, it shouldn\u2019t need to reflect theirs for them to give a long. It\u2019s also more realistic that people with different backgrounds can still like and understand each other, and it\u2019s not like they came together _because_ they were the same. \nIt really helps take out the elistist feel out of the ninja core, especially with how many people come from ninja clans.\nShe was a bit of a spoiled, bratty kid who had to get a taste of the real world, and let go of her insecurities to befriend people she didn\u2019t initially like properly. That\u2019s pretty great and refreshing from the Lonely Orphan with Emotional Regulation Issues that is literally her entire team. _Because_ she didn\u2019t live such an extreme life, she can remind the rest that they don\u2019t always need extreme solutions to fix things, either. Team 7 loving them despite how different their backgrounds are feels more real to me than them merely liking her because their stories are identical. Makes it sound a bit narcissistic if the only value she has is being like them. It also lets her not become another clone and a properly independent character in the story.",

It\u2019s not a good thing, either. \n\nJapanese people also don\u2019t have a good work-life balance - particularly men - because of how much overwork is encouraged, and with the struggles to find a a decent paying job, many youths don\u2019t want family because of how poor their own family was due to work, they don\u2019t trust the work force with their peer pressure issues and overwork issues, and because they can\u2019t work enough to pay for themselves, nevermind support a family. \n\nKishimoto ended up embodying all the bad things of Japanese work-life balance when he didn\u2019t need to. \n\nThere was no reason that the women of Naruto couldn\u2019t have a job and still be there for their kids. It\u2019s totally possible, but Kishimoto focused more on them being housewives first without acknowledging their own jobs outside the home, despite the fact that we see the men at their jobs first and more often then we see them with their kids. I think Sai and Shikamaru are one of the few to have good domestic scenes with their kids, and we know Shikamaru still has an important job.

The simple fact that she lives in Konoha serves as a diplomatic link to Sunagakure. \n\nSocieties aren\u2019t just built by engineers, lawyers and politicians. They are built by mothers and fathers just as much, if not more. Temari is still a ninja, if she\u2019s ever needed as a ninja the village can request her aid. I really think you\u2019re making a mountain out of a mole hill here, she seems to be quite happy with the role she chose, and she clearly wears the pants in her relationship, so I highly doubt that Shikamaru ever forced her into being a homemaker.",

From Sasuke Shinden, Hinata was already married and still worked, presumably until Naruto became hokage. From the Shikamaru Novel, Shikamaru is so busy that he forgot their wedding aniversary, so I would guess that Temari became a housewife to compensate for Shika's lack of parenting.",

I'm sorry, but you can't just come in and say you always loved and supported a guy even no one else did. I don't recall seeing her bitch ass buying Naruto a bowl of Ramen when he was starving, being  one of a handful of people to not treat Naruto like dirt, and et cetera.

This is even less negligible that ninjas exams are based on chakra utilization, not human strength utilization.\n\nBut even if we base ourself in physical strength, aren\u2019t females as strong, if this is not even more than males in Naruto ?

And not just in the \u201cthey just needed someone to love them\u201d sort of way, but in the \u201cwow, this world is so f*cked up and no one\u2019s done anything about it???\u201d way. Like how many orphans were picked up for some insane plot, yet only _ONE_ character thought to fix that or thought that system could be better (Kabuto)? Realizing the powers that be failed to put a system in place that actually protected people, and put it in such words. It was sometimes _implied_ (like the Hyuuga\u2019s clans issues and needing a leader with a spine), but not much else is actually done with it after. \n\nThe Mental Health hospital thing felt like a addition for something that wasn\u2019t obviously addressed in canon, if I\u2019m making sense. Like it was obviously needed, but Kishimoto didn\u2019t to put the seeds within the story to build it, and added it in after the fact. Like someone else had to remind him that it was a problem that needed to be solved instead of him remembering it was a problem the whole time? Like, who explicitly talks about mental health and what something like therapy could help in the Naruto verse prior to Boruto? Lots of talk about peace versus war, and love versus hate, but not talks of how much these traumatized people having the self awareness that what they have is trauma that didn\u2019t need to happen, or some other character was like \u201cwhat the help they needed could have looked like.\u201d I felt like those similar convos turned into Talk no Jutsu, and usually from just Naruto\u2019s mouth, rather than anyone else, which I feel kinda cheapens it because of how tired Naruto being the Dues Ex Machina with Talk no Jutsu is for me, and also because I don\u2019t think Naruto is nearly as empathetic about things as he could have been, which doesn\u2019t help that situation.\n\nI guess there was too much abstraction around it for my taste? Like, I seriously never expected that the Naruto universe would ever _explicitly_ address the need for mental health practices, to the point that I was genuinely so surprised it became a thing, if only in Boruto. It felt like fanon, really.\n\n Like, I\u2019m very much on the train that Konoha, and Hiruzen in particular failed their orphans in particular at every step possible, largely due to apathy. Like, having several traumatized children live on their own before they can even see over a countertop, and calling it a day at best. Kakashi is also another example - not _once_ did anyone think to let this kid be a kid instead of expecting him to be \u201cstiff upper lip\u201d soldier? Kushina and Minato were the closest people to do that, but the constant deaths he experienced should have had them pull him out of high-rankings to chill out and _be_ for a bit.",

Also let\u2019s them into a civilian life style - what a life away from being a ninja - can look like. No one else can give them that. I don\u2019t think every character needs a personal tragedy to develop and like each other - they just need some self awareness and empathy, which Sakura could have had. It also could have shown them how to love people that aren\u2019t blood, because while Sakura has a blood family, she loves them, too, as family and as friends and romantic.\nHer living situation is very different, it shouldn\u2019t need to reflect theirs for them to give a long. It\u2019s also more realistic that people with different backgrounds can still like and understand each other, and it\u2019s not like they came together _because_ they were the same. \nIt really helps take out the elistist feel out of the ninja core, especially with how many people come from ninja clans.\nShe was a bit of a spoiled, bratty kid who had to get a taste of the real world, and let go of her insecurities to befriend people she didn\u2019t initially like properly. That\u2019s pretty great and refreshing from the Lonely Orphan with Emotional Regulation Issues that is literally her entire team. _Because_ she didn\u2019t live such an extreme life, she can remind the rest that they don\u2019t always need extreme solutions to fix things, either. Team 7 loving them despite how different their backgrounds are feels more real to me than them merely liking her because their stories are identical. Makes it sound a bit narcissistic if the only value she has is being like them. It also lets her not become another clone and a properly independent character in the story.",

It\u2019s not a good thing, either. \n\nJapanese people also don\u2019t have a good work-life balance - particularly men - because of how much overwork is encouraged, and with the struggles to find a a decent paying job, many youths don\u2019t want family because of how poor their own family was due to work, they don\u2019t trust the work force with their peer pressure issues and overwork issues, and because they can\u2019t work enough to pay for themselves, nevermind support a family. \n\nKishimoto ended up embodying all the bad things of Japanese work-life balance when he didn\u2019t need to. \n\nThere was no reason that the women of Naruto couldn\u2019t have a job and still be there for their kids. It\u2019s totally possible, but Kishimoto focused more on them being housewives first without acknowledging their own jobs outside the home, despite the fact that we see the men at their jobs first and more often then we see them with their kids. I think Sai and Shikamaru are one of the few to have good domestic scenes with their kids, and we know Shikamaru still has an important job.

He wasn\u2019t thinking \u201cWell, I can\u2019t have this WOMAN doing a MAN\u2019s job and thinking she can have a CAREER or something, she BELONGS in the kitchen and changing diapers!!!\u201d, though that seems to be your head canon.You\u2019re the one making the sexist insinuation that women who chose to be housewives are somehow lesser or that they lack ambition, which is complete and utter bullshit. My mother used to be a banker and made really good money, and then she decided to get married and have kids, at which point she chose to quit her job and become a stay-at-home mom. This is a choice millions of women make at some point of their lives, and just because it\u2019s a choice you don\u2019t personally like doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the \u201cwrong\u201d choice. And guess what? Being a good homemaker is a HARD fucking job that requires a full time commitment, and unlike a \u201ccareer job\u201d, if you fail at it you do so at the direct detriment of your family.\n\nI mean from what I can tell, all the girls that become housewifes are after Naruto became Hokage. From Sasuke Shinden, Hinata was already married and still worked, presumably until Naruto became hokage. From the Shikamaru Novel, Shikamaru is so busy that he forgot their wedding aniversary, so I would guess that Temari became a housewife to compensate for Shika's lack of parenting.",

This is even less negligible that ninjas exams are based on chakra utilization, not human strength utilization.\n\nBut even if we base ourself in physical strength, aren\u2019t females as strong, if this is not even more than males in Naruto ?

And not just in the \u201cthey just needed someone to love them\u201d sort of way, but in the \u201cwow, this world is so f*cked up and no one\u2019s done anything about it???\u201d way. Like how many orphans were picked up for some insane plot, yet only _ONE_ character thought to fix that or thought that system could be better (Kabuto)? Realizing the powers that be failed to put a system in place that actually protected people, and put it in such words. It was sometimes _implied_ (like the Hyuuga\u2019s clans issues and needing a leader with a spine), but not much else is actually done with it after. \n\nThe Mental Health hospital thing felt like a addition for something that wasn\u2019t obviously addressed in canon, if I\u2019m making sense. Like it was obviously needed, but Kishimoto didn\u2019t to put the seeds within the story to build it, and added it in after the fact. Like someone else had to remind him that it was a problem that needed to be solved instead of him remembering it was a problem the whole time? Like, who explicitly talks about mental health and what something like therapy could help in the Naruto verse prior to Boruto? Lots of talk about peace versus war, and love versus hate, but not talks of how much these traumatized people having the self awareness that what they have is trauma that didn\u2019t need to happen, or some other character was like \u201cwhat the help they needed could have looked like.\u201d I felt like those similar convos turned into Talk no Jutsu, and usually from just Naruto\u2019s mouth, rather than anyone else, which I feel kinda cheapens it because of how tired Naruto being the Dues Ex Machina with Talk no Jutsu is for me, and also because I don\u2019t think Naruto is nearly as empathetic about things as he could have been, which doesn\u2019t help that situation.\n\nI guess there was too much abstraction around it for my taste? Like, I seriously never expected that the Naruto universe would ever _explicitly_ address the need for mental health practices, to the point that I was genuinely so surprised it became a thing, if only in Boruto. It felt like fanon, really.\n\n Like, I\u2019m very much on the train that Konoha, and Hiruzen in particular failed their orphans in particular at every step possible, largely due to apathy. Like, having several traumatized children live on their own before they can even see over a countertop, and calling it a day at best. Kakashi is also another example - not _once_ did anyone think to let this kid be a kid instead of expecting him to be \u201cstiff upper lip\u201d soldier? Kushina and Minato were the closest people to do that, but the constant deaths he experienced should have had them pull him out of high-rankings to chill out and _be_ for a bit.",

Also let\u2019s them into a civilian life style - what a life away from being a ninja - can look like. No one else can give them that. I don\u2019t think every character needs a personal tragedy to develop and like each other - they just need some self awareness and empathy, which Sakura could have had. It also could have shown them how to love people that aren\u2019t blood, because while Sakura has a blood family, she loves them, too, as family and as friends and romantic.\nHer living situation is very different, it shouldn\u2019t need to reflect theirs for them to give a long. It\u2019s also more realistic that people with different backgrounds can still like and understand each other, and it\u2019s not like they came together _because_ they were the same. \nIt really helps take out the elistist feel out of the ninja core, especially with how many people come from ninja clans.\nShe was a bit of a spoiled, bratty kid who had to get a taste of the real world, and let go of her insecurities to befriend people she didn\u2019t initially like properly. That\u2019s pretty great and refreshing from the Lonely Orphan with Emotional Regulation Issues that is literally her entire team. _Because_ she didn\u2019t live such an extreme life, she can remind the rest that they don\u2019t always need extreme solutions to fix things, either. Team 7 loving them despite how different their backgrounds are feels more real to me than them merely liking her because their stories are identical. Makes it sound a bit narcissistic if the only value she has is being like them. It also lets her not become another clone and a properly independent character in the story.",

From Sasuke Shinden, Hinata was already married and still worked, presumably until Naruto became hokage. From the Shikamaru Novel, Shikamaru is so busy that he forgot their wedding aniversary, so I would guess that Temari became a housewife to compensate for Shika's lack of parenting.",

This is even less negligible that ninjas exams are based on chakra utilization, not human strength utilization.\n\nBut even if we base ourself in physical strength, aren\u2019t females as strong, if this is not even more than males in Naruto ?

For a major character, she sure doesn\u2019t feel like one. You shouldn\u2019t have had to wait until Boruto to give more substance to her character. I love Shikamaru, but so many fans are using Boruto/Hiden content about him to try to retcon him as being closer to Naruto before Boruto than he actually was for no real reason, like he couldn\u2019t have been interesting without being \u201cNaruto\u2019s best friend\u201d first, or whatever, despite all his character arcs having near nothing to do with Naruto.",

Also let\u2019s them into a civilian life style - what a life away from being a ninja - can look like. No one else can give them that. I don\u2019t think every character needs a personal tragedy to develop and like each other - they just need some self awareness and empathy, which Sakura could have had. It also could have shown them how to love people that aren\u2019t blood, because while Sakura has a blood family, she loves them, too, as family and as friends and romantic.\nHer living situation is very different, it shouldn\u2019t need to reflect theirs for them to give a long. It\u2019s also more realistic that people with different backgrounds can still like and understand each other, and it\u2019s not like they came together _because_ they were the same. \nIt really helps take out the elistist feel out of the ninja core, especially with how many people come from ninja clans.\nShe was a bit of a spoiled, bratty kid who had to get a taste of the real world, and let go of her insecurities to befriend people she didn\u2019t initially like properly. That\u2019s pretty great and refreshing from the Lonely Orphan with Emotional Regulation Issues that is literally her entire team. _Because_ she didn\u2019t live such an extreme life, she can remind the rest that they don\u2019t always need extreme solutions to fix things, either. Team 7 loving them despite how different their backgrounds are feels more real to me than them merely liking her because their stories are identical. Makes it sound a bit narcissistic if the only value she has is being like them. It also lets her not become another clone and a properly independent character in the story.",

For a major character, she sure doesn\u2019t feel like one. You shouldn\u2019t have had to wait until Boruto to give more substance to her character. I love Shikamaru, but so many fans are using Boruto/Hiden content about him to try to retcon him as being closer to Naruto before Boruto than he actually was for no real reason, like he couldn\u2019t have been interesting without being \u201cNaruto\u2019s best friend\u201d first, or whatever, despite all his character arcs having near nothing to do with Naruto.",

Kishimoto\u2019s sexism really jumped out with her. Refused her chances to just have value in herself without constantly downplaying it somehow.\nI hated Shippuden from the start with who they kept trying to force the idea that \u201ceveryone\u2019s\u201d more mature now, but not actually having any substance in there. It was aggravating. It felt like it wasted all the potential of Part 1, and it seems I was right.",

They would all be orphans then and would all have a family type bond that none of the other teams really have.

Also let\u2019s them into a civilian life style - what a life away from being a ninja - can look like. No one else can give them that. I don\u2019t think every character needs a personal tragedy to develop and like each other - they just need some self awareness and empathy, which Sakura could have had. It also could have shown them how to love people that aren\u2019t blood, because while Sakura has a blood family, she loves them, too, as family and as friends and romantic.\nHer living situation is very different, it shouldn\u2019t need to reflect theirs for them to give a long. It\u2019s also more realistic that people with different backgrounds can still like and understand each other, and it\u2019s not like they came together _because_ they were the same. \nIt really helps take out the elistist feel out of the ninja core, especially with how many people come from ninja clans.\nShe was a bit of a spoiled, bratty kid who had to get a taste of the real world, and let go of her insecurities to befriend people she didn\u2019t initially like properly. That\u2019s pretty great and refreshing from the Lonely Orphan with Emotional Regulation Issues that is literally her entire team. _Because_ she didn\u2019t live such an extreme life, she can remind the rest that they don\u2019t always need extreme solutions to fix things, either. Team 7 loving them despite how different their backgrounds are feels more real to me than them merely liking her because their stories are identical. Makes it sound a bit narcissistic if the only value she has is being like them. It also lets her not become another clone and a properly independent character in the story.",

Also let\u2019s them into a civilian life style - what a life away from being a ninja - can look like. No one else can give them that. I don\u2019t think every character needs a personal tragedy to develop and like each other - they just need some self awareness and empathy, which Sakura could have had. It also could have shown them how to love people that aren\u2019t blood, because while Sakura has a blood family, she loves them, too, as family and as friends and romantic.\nHer living situation is very different, it shouldn\u2019t need to reflect theirs for them to give a long. It\u2019s also more realistic that people with different backgrounds can still like and understand each other, and it\u2019s not like they came together _because_ they were the same. \nIt really helps take out the elistist feel out of the ninja core, especially with how many people come from ninja clans.\nShe was a bit of a spoiled, bratty kid who had to get a taste of the real world, and let go of her insecurities to befriend people she didn\u2019t initially like properly. That\u2019s pretty great and refreshing from the Lonely Orphan with Emotional Regulation Issues that is literally her entire team. _Because_ she didn\u2019t live such an extreme life, she can remind the rest that they don\u2019t always need extreme solutions to fix things, either. Team 7 loving them despite how different their backgrounds are feels more real to me than them merely liking her because their stories are identical. Makes it sound a bit narcissistic if the only value she has is being like them. It also lets her not become another clone and a properly independent character in the story.",

For a major character, she sure doesn\u2019t feel like one. You shouldn\u2019t have had to wait until Boruto to give more substance to her character.

Also let\u2019s them into a civilian life style - what a life away from being a ninja - can look like. No one else can give them that. I don\u2019t think every character needs a personal tragedy to develop and like each other - they just need some self awareness and empathy, which Sakura could have had. It also could have shown them how to love people that aren\u2019t blood, because while Sakura has a blood family, she loves them, too, as family and as friends and romantic.\nHer living situation is very different, it shouldn\u2019t need to reflect theirs for them to give a long. It\u2019s also more realistic that people with different backgrounds can still like and understand each other, and it\u2019s not like they came together _because_ they were the same. \nIt really helps take out the elistist feel out of the ninja core, especially with how many people come from ninja clans.\nShe was a bit of a spoiled, bratty kid who had to get a taste of the real world, and let go of her insecurities to befriend people she didn\u2019t initially like properly. That\u2019s pretty great and refreshing from the Lonely Orphan with Emotional Regulation Issues that is literally her entire team. _Because_ she didn\u2019t live such an extreme life, she can remind the rest that they don\u2019t always need extreme solutions to fix things, either. Team 7 loving them despite how different their backgrounds are feels more real to me than them merely liking her because their stories are identical. Makes it sound a bit narcissistic if the only value she has is being like them. It also lets her not become another clone and a properly independent character in the story.",

This is even less negligible that ninjas exams are based on chakra utilization, not human strength utilization.\n\nBut even if we base ourself in physical strength, aren\u2019t females as strong, if this is not even more than males in Naruto ?

Kishimoto\u2019s sexism really jumped out with her.

It was aggravating. It felt like it wasted all the potential of Part 1, and it seems I was right.",

Also let\u2019s them into a civilian life style - what a life away from being a ninja - can look like. No one else can give them that. I don\u2019t think every character needs a personal tragedy to develop and like each other - they just need some self awareness and empathy, which Sakura could have had. It also could have shown them how to love people that aren\u2019t blood, because while Sakura has a blood family, she loves them, too, as family and as friends and romantic.\nHer living situation is very different, it shouldn\u2019t need to reflect theirs for them to give a long. It\u2019s also more realistic that people with different backgrounds can still like and understand each other, and it\u2019s not like they came together _because_ they were the same. \nIt really helps take out the elistist feel out of the ninja core, especially with how many people come from ninja clans.\nShe was a bit of a spoiled, bratty kid who had to get a taste of the real world, and let go of her insecurities to befriend people she didn\u2019t initially like properly. That\u2019s pretty great and refreshing from the Lonely Orphan with Emotional Regulation Issues that is literally her entire team. _Because_ she didn\u2019t live such an extreme life, she can remind the rest that they don\u2019t always need extreme solutions to fix things, either. Team 7 loving them despite how different their backgrounds are feels more real to me than them merely liking her because their stories are identical. Makes it sound a bit narcissistic if the only value she has is being like them. It also lets her not become another clone and a properly independent character in the story.",

This is even less negligible that ninjas exams are based on chakra utilization, not human strength utilization.\n\nBut even if we base ourself in physical strength, aren\u2019t females as strong, if this is not even more than males in Naruto ? Sakura and Tsunade can literally break the ground with their bare hands.",

Also let\u2019s them into a civilian life style - what a life away from being a ninja - can look like. No one else can give them that. I don\u2019t think every character needs a personal tragedy to develop and like each other - they just need some self awareness and empathy, which Sakura could have had. It also could have shown them how to love people that aren\u2019t blood, because while Sakura has a blood family, she loves them, too, as family and as friends and romantic.\nHer living situation is very different, it shouldn\u2019t need to reflect theirs for them to give a long. It\u2019s also more realistic that people with different backgrounds can still like and understand each other, and it\u2019s not like they came together _because_ they were the same. \nIt really helps take out the elistist feel out of the ninja core, especially with how many people come from ninja clans.\nShe was a bit of a spoiled, bratty kid who had to get a taste of the real world, and let go of her insecurities to befriend people she didn\u2019t initially like properly. That\u2019s pretty great and refreshing from the Lonely Orphan with Emotional Regulation Issues that is literally her entire team. _Because_ she didn\u2019t live such an extreme life, she can remind the rest that they don\u2019t always need extreme solutions to fix things, either. Team 7 loving them despite how different their backgrounds are feels more real to me than them merely liking her because their stories are identical. Makes it sound a bit narcissistic if the only value she has is being like them. It also lets her not become another clone and a properly independent character in the story.",

Also let\u2019s them into a civilian life style - what a life away from being a ninja - can look like. No one else can give them that. I don\u2019t think every character needs a personal tragedy to develop and like each other - they just need some self awareness and empathy, which Sakura could have had. It also could have shown them how to love people that aren\u2019t blood, because while Sakura has a blood family, she loves them, too, as family and as friends and romantic.\nHer living situation is very different, it shouldn\u2019t need to reflect theirs for them to give a long. It\u2019s also more realistic that people with different backgrounds can still like and understand each other, and it\u2019s not like they came together _because_ they were the same. \nIt really helps take out the elistist feel out of the ninja core, especially with how many people come from ninja clans.\nShe was a bit of a spoiled, bratty kid who had to get a taste of the real world, and let go of her insecurities to befriend people she didn\u2019t initially like properly. That\u2019s pretty great and refreshing from the Lonely Orphan with Emotional Regulation Issues that is literally her entire team. _Because_ she didn\u2019t live such an extreme life, she can remind the rest that they don\u2019t always need extreme solutions to fix things, either. Team 7 loving them despite how different their backgrounds are feels more real to me than them merely liking her because their stories are identical. Makes it sound a bit narcissistic if the only value she has is being like them. It also lets her not become another clone and a properly independent character in the story.",

Also let\u2019s them into a civilian life style - what a life away from being a ninja - can look like. No one else can give them that. I don\u2019t think every character needs a personal tragedy to develop and like each other - they just need some self awareness and empathy, which Sakura could have had. It also could have shown them how to love people that aren\u2019t blood, because while Sakura has a blood family, she loves them, too, as family and as friends and romantic.\nHer living situation is very different, it shouldn\u2019t need to reflect theirs for them to give a long. It\u2019s also more realistic that people with different backgrounds can still like and understand each other, and it\u2019s not like they came together _because_ they were the same. \nIt really helps take out the elistist feel out of the ninja core, especially with how many people come from ninja clans.\nShe was a bit of a spoiled, bratty kid who had to get a taste of the real world, and let go of her insecurities to befriend people she didn\u2019t initially like properly. That\u2019s pretty great and refreshing from the Lonely Orphan with Emotional Regulation Issues that is literally her entire team. _Because_ she didn\u2019t live such an extreme life, she can remind the rest that they don\u2019t always need extreme solutions to fix things, either. Team 7 loving them despite how different their backgrounds are feels more real to me than them merely liking her because their stories are identical. Makes it sound a bit narcissistic if the only value she has is being like them. It also lets her not become another clone and a properly independent character in the story.",
