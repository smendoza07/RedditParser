I explained to you in a perfectly decent manner why it\u2019s not ideal to say if you were actually talking to and/or about real people.\n\nIt is a widely used term, particularly within ageism. \nAnother contextual example for you would be someone well qualified for a job being rejected because they are \u201cof a certain age\u201d and they are \u201coverqualified\u201d. \n\nPerhaps rather than mocking someone for trying to give you some information to improve your understanding of the language you use and why people may not take kindly to ityou should try being less judgmental.\n\nI\u2019ll be sure to remember your username so next time you\u2019re being ignorant about your choice of words I\u2019ll be sure not to suggest otherwise, let you make a fool of yourself and find out the hard way. :)",

That was my mistake. \n\nBut I still don't support your point about naming. I can give you more example. Like, Temari, she is from Kazekage clan which is the 5th strogest clan in the whole \"Naruto series\" (according to cbr.com). But after marrying Shikamaru she was considered as a Nara clan member and their child was named after Nara clan \"Shikadai Nara\". If the naming concept would be by importance of clan then Temari's clan is far stronger than Nara clan. They shouldn't use Nara as surname. \n\nPoint to be noted, Temari didn't use a clan name or surname before marriage.  But after marrying Shikamaru, she used the clan name of her husband just like the japanese naming system. It's proof that in \" Naruto\" series they used japanese naming system. And that's why child's surname should be given by it's father's surname. It also applies for Naruto... ////\n\n<https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbr.com/naruto-strongest-clans-ranked-by-strength/amp/>",

Of course  it has the healing factor to it but I dont think sarada has that feature and neither would any of her kids would (unless they also have that seal)\n\nAfter it is used once (the seal), you have to start storing chakra again(another couple of years) but for the uzumaki reserves, you can probably replenish your chakra within a week without the help of the  seal.

I explained to you in a perfectly decent manner why it\u2019s not ideal to say if you were actually talking to and/or about real people.\n\nIt is a widely used term, particularly within ageism. \nAnother contextual example for you would be someone well qualified for a job being rejected because they are \u201cof a certain age\u201d and they are \u201coverqualified\u201d. \n\nPerhaps rather than mocking someone for trying to give you some information to improve your understanding of the language you use and why people may not take kindly to ityou should try being less judgmental.\n\nI\u2019ll be sure to remember your username so next time you\u2019re being ignorant about your choice of words I\u2019ll be sure not to suggest otherwise, let you make a fool of yourself and find out the hard way. :)",

That was my mistake. \n\nBut I still don't support your point about naming. I can give you more example. Like, Temari, she is from Kazekage clan which is the 5th strogest clan in the whole \"Naruto series\" (according to cbr.com). But after marrying Shikamaru she was considered as a Nara clan member and their child was named after Nara clan \"Shikadai Nara\". If the naming concept would be by importance of clan then Temari's clan is far stronger than Nara clan. They shouldn't use Nara as surname. \n\nPoint to be noted, Temari didn't use a clan name or surname before marriage.  But after marrying Shikamaru, she used the clan name of her husband just like the japanese naming system. It's proof that in \" Naruto\" series they used japanese naming system. And that's why child's surname should be given by it's father's surname. It also applies for Naruto... ////\n\n<https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbr.com/naruto-strongest-clans-ranked-by-strength/amp/>",

If they didn't follow japanese naming system as you told before, Temari won't change her name after marriage. \nEven they could give no surname to Shikadai but did that happen?  Shikadai got a surname from his father. \n\nYou'll also notice that in Choji's case. Choji's wife Karui got a surname after marriage. \n\nBut there is an exception in Ino-Sai case. As Sai is from no clan, their son Inujin got a surname from Yamanaka clan. In my openion, this exception is acceptable as Sai is not from any clan and he has no family background.",

Also, the 100 healing mark has chakra gathered over a couple of years, stored in the seal and I feel like with the huge amount of chakra, giving chakra to someone to open dimensions  doesn't seem like too much of a stretch (maybe it is). Of course  it has the healing factor to it but I dont think sarada has that feature and neither would any of her kids would (unless they also have that seal)\n\nAfter it is used once (the seal), you have to start storing chakra again(another couple of years) but for the uzumaki reserves, you can probably replenish your chakra within a week without the help of the  seal. So in short, the recuperation of chakra for the uzumaki and their reserves seems to be somewhat close to sakura's",

I explained to you in a perfectly decent manner why it\u2019s not ideal to say if you were actually talking to and/or about real people.\n\nIt is a widely used term, particularly within ageism. \nAnother contextual example for you would be someone well qualified for a job being rejected because they are \u201cof a certain age\u201d and they are \u201coverqualified\u201d. \n\nPerhaps rather than mocking someone for trying to give you some information to improve your understanding of the language you use and why people may not take kindly to ityou should try being less judgmental.\n\nI\u2019ll be sure to remember your username so next time you\u2019re being ignorant about your choice of words I\u2019ll be sure not to suggest otherwise, let you make a fool of yourself and find out the hard way. :)",

That was my mistake. \n\nBut I still don't support your point about naming. I can give you more example. Like, Temari, she is from Kazekage clan which is the 5th strogest clan in the whole \"Naruto series\" (according to cbr.com). But after marrying Shikamaru she was considered as a Nara clan member and their child was named after Nara clan \"Shikadai Nara\". If the naming concept would be by importance of clan then Temari's clan is far stronger than Nara clan. They shouldn't use Nara as surname. \n\nPoint to be noted, Temari didn't use a clan name or surname before marriage.  But after marrying Shikamaru, she used the clan name of her husband just like the japanese naming system. It's proof that in \" Naruto\" series they used japanese naming system. And that's why child's surname should be given by it's father's surname. It also applies for Naruto... ////\n\n<https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbr.com/naruto-strongest-clans-ranked-by-strength/amp/>",

If they didn't follow japanese naming system as you told before, Temari won't change her name after marriage. \nEven they could give no surname to Shikadai but did that happen?  Shikadai got a surname from his father. \n\nYou'll also notice that in Choji's case. Choji's wife Karui got a surname after marriage. \n\nBut there is an exception in Ino-Sai case. As Sai is from no clan, their son Inujin got a surname from Yamanaka clan. In my openion, this exception is acceptable as Sai is not from any clan and he has no family background.",

Of course  it has the healing factor to it but I dont think sarada has that feature and neither would any of her kids would (unless they also have that seal)\n\nAfter it is used once (the seal), you have to start storing chakra again(another couple of years) but for the uzumaki reserves, you can probably replenish your chakra within a week without the help of the  seal. So in short, the recuperation of chakra for the uzumaki and their reserves seems to be somewhat close to sakura's",

I explained to you in a perfectly decent manner why it\u2019s not ideal to say if you were actually talking to and/or about real people.\n\nIt is a widely used term, particularly within ageism. \nAnother contextual example for you would be someone well qualified for a job being rejected because they are \u201cof a certain age\u201d and they are \u201coverqualified\u201d. \n\nPerhaps rather than mocking someone for trying to give you some information to improve your understanding of the language you use and why people may not take kindly to ityou should try being less judgmental.\n\nI\u2019ll be sure to remember your username so next time you\u2019re being ignorant about your choice of words I\u2019ll be sure not to suggest otherwise, let you make a fool of yourself and find out the hard way. :)",

That was my mistake. \n\nBut I still don't support your point about naming. I can give you more example. Like, Temari, she is from Kazekage clan which is the 5th strogest clan in the whole \"Naruto series\" (according to cbr.com). But after marrying Shikamaru she was considered as a Nara clan member and their child was named after Nara clan \"Shikadai Nara\". If the naming concept would be by importance of clan then Temari's clan is far stronger than Nara clan. They shouldn't use Nara as surname. \n\nPoint to be noted, Temari didn't use a clan name or surname before marriage.  But after marrying Shikamaru, she used the clan name of her husband just like the japanese naming system. It's proof that in \" Naruto\" series they used japanese naming system. And that's why child's surname should be given by it's father's surname. It also applies for Naruto... ////\n\n<https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbr.com/naruto-strongest-clans-ranked-by-strength/amp/>",

Of course  it has the healing factor to it but I dont think sarada has that feature and neither would any of her kids would (unless they also have that seal)\n\nAfter it is used once (the seal), you have to start storing chakra again(another couple of years) but for the uzumaki reserves, you can probably replenish your chakra within a week without the help of the  seal.

That was my mistake. \n\nBut I still don't support your point about naming. I can give you more example. Like, Temari, she is from Kazekage clan which is the 5th strogest clan in the whole \"Naruto series\" (according to cbr.com). But after marrying Shikamaru she was considered as a Nara clan member and their child was named after Nara clan \"Shikadai Nara\". If the naming concept would be by importance of clan then Temari's clan is far stronger than Nara clan. They shouldn't use Nara as surname. \n\nPoint to be noted, Temari didn't use a clan name or surname before marriage.  But after marrying Shikamaru, she used the clan name of her husband just like the japanese naming system. It's proof that in \" Naruto\" series they used japanese naming system. And that's why child's surname should be given by it's father's surname. It also applies for Naruto... ////\n\n<https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbr.com/naruto-strongest-clans-ranked-by-strength/amp/>",

If they didn't follow japanese naming system as you told before, Temari won't change her name after marriage. \nEven they could give no surname to Shikadai but did that happen?  Shikadai got a surname from his father. \n\nYou'll also notice that in Choji's case. Choji's wife Karui got a surname after marriage. \n\nBut there is an exception in Ino-Sai case. As Sai is from no clan, their son Inujin got a surname from Yamanaka clan. In my openion, this exception is acceptable as Sai is not from any clan and he has no family background.",

Also, the 100 healing mark has chakra gathered over a couple of years, stored in the seal and I feel like with the huge amount of chakra, giving chakra to someone to open dimensions  doesn't seem like too much of a stretch (maybe it is). Of course  it has the healing factor to it but I dont think sarada has that feature and neither would any of her kids would (unless they also have that seal)\n\nAfter it is used once (the seal), you have to start storing chakra again(another couple of years) but for the uzumaki reserves, you can probably replenish your chakra within a week without the help of the  seal.

That was my mistake. \n\nBut I still don't support your point about naming. I can give you more example. Like, Temari, she is from Kazekage clan which is the 5th strogest clan in the whole \"Naruto series\" (according to cbr.com). But after marrying Shikamaru she was considered as a Nara clan member and their child was named after Nara clan \"Shikadai Nara\". If the naming concept would be by importance of clan then Temari's clan is far stronger than Nara clan. They shouldn't use Nara as surname. \n\nPoint to be noted, Temari didn't use a clan name or surname before marriage.  But after marrying Shikamaru, she used the clan name of her husband just like the japanese naming system. It's proof that in \" Naruto\" series they used japanese naming system. And that's why child's surname should be given by it's father's surname. It also applies for Naruto... ////\n\n<https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbr.com/naruto-strongest-clans-ranked-by-strength/amp/>",

If they didn't follow japanese naming system as you told before, Temari won't change her name after marriage. \nEven they could give no surname to Shikadai but did that happen?  Shikadai got a surname from his father. \n\nYou'll also notice that in Choji's case. Choji's wife Karui got a surname after marriage. \n\nBut there is an exception in Ino-Sai case. As Sai is from no clan, their son Inujin got a surname from Yamanaka clan. In my openion, this exception is acceptable as Sai is not from any clan and he has no family background.",

Also, the 100 healing mark has chakra gathered over a couple of years, stored in the seal and I feel like with the huge amount of chakra, giving chakra to someone to open dimensions  doesn't seem like too much of a stretch (maybe it is). Of course  it has the healing factor to it but I dont think sarada has that feature and neither would any of her kids would (unless they also have that seal)\n\nAfter it is used once (the seal), you have to start storing chakra again(another couple of years) but for the uzumaki reserves, you can probably replenish your chakra within a week without the help of the  seal. So in short, the recuperation of chakra for the uzumaki and their reserves seems to be somewhat close to sakura's",

I can give you more example. Like, Temari, she is from Kazekage clan which is the 5th strogest clan in the whole \"Naruto series\" (according to cbr.com). But after marrying Shikamaru she was considered as a Nara clan member and their child was named after Nara clan \"Shikadai Nara\". If the naming concept would be by importance of clan then Temari's clan is far stronger than Nara clan. They shouldn't use Nara as surname. \n\nPoint to be noted, Temari didn't use a clan name or surname before marriage.  But after marrying Shikamaru, she used the clan name of her husband just like the japanese naming system. It's proof that in \" Naruto\" series they used japanese naming system. And that's why child's surname should be given by it's father's surname. It also applies for Naruto... ////\n\n<https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbr.com/naruto-strongest-clans-ranked-by-strength/amp/>",

If they didn't follow japanese naming system as you told before, Temari won't change her name after marriage. \nEven they could give no surname to Shikadai but did that happen?  Shikadai got a surname from his father. \n\nYou'll also notice that in Choji's case. Choji's wife Karui got a surname after marriage. \n\nBut there is an exception in Ino-Sai case. As Sai is from no clan, their son Inujin got a surname from Yamanaka clan. In my openion, this exception is acceptable as Sai is not from any clan and he has no family background.",

Also, the 100 healing mark has chakra gathered over a couple of years, stored in the seal and I feel like with the huge amount of chakra, giving chakra to someone to open dimensions  doesn't seem like too much of a stretch (maybe it is). Of course  it has the healing factor to it but I dont think sarada has that feature and neither would any of her kids would (unless they also have that seal)\n\nAfter it is used once (the seal), you have to start storing chakra again(another couple of years) but for the uzumaki reserves, you can probably replenish your chakra within a week without the help of the  seal. So in short, the recuperation of chakra for the uzumaki and their reserves seems to be somewhat close to sakura's",

I explained to you in a perfectly decent manner why it\u2019s not ideal to say if you were actually talking to and/or about real people.\n\nIt is a widely used term, particularly within ageism. \nAnother contextual example for you would be someone well qualified for a job being rejected because they are \u201cof a certain age\u201d and they are \u201coverqualified\u201d. \n\nPerhaps rather than mocking someone for trying to give you some information to improve your understanding of the language you use and why people may not take kindly to ityou should try being less judgmental.\n\nI\u2019ll be sure to remember your username so next time you\u2019re being ignorant about your choice of words I\u2019ll be sure not to suggest otherwise, let you make a fool of yourself and find out the hard way. :)",

I can give you more example. Like, Temari, she is from Kazekage clan which is the 5th strogest clan in the whole \"Naruto series\" (according to cbr.com). But after marrying Shikamaru she was considered as a Nara clan member and their child was named after Nara clan \"Shikadai Nara\". If the naming concept would be by importance of clan then Temari's clan is far stronger than Nara clan. They shouldn't use Nara as surname. \n\nPoint to be noted, Temari didn't use a clan name or surname before marriage.  But after marrying Shikamaru, she used the clan name of her husband just like the japanese naming system. It's proof that in \" Naruto\" series they used japanese naming system. And that's why child's surname should be given by it's father's surname. It also applies for Naruto... ////\n\n<https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbr.com/naruto-strongest-clans-ranked-by-strength/amp/>",

If they didn't follow japanese naming system as you told before, Temari won't change her name after marriage. \nEven they could give no surname to Shikadai but did that happen?  Shikadai got a surname from his father. \n\nYou'll also notice that in Choji's case. Choji's wife Karui got a surname after marriage. \n\nBut there is an exception in Ino-Sai case. As Sai is from no clan, their son Inujin got a surname from Yamanaka clan. In my openion, this exception is acceptable as Sai is not from any clan and he has no family background.",

I explained to you in a perfectly decent manner why it\u2019s not ideal to say if you were actually talking to and/or about real people.\n\nIt is a widely used term, particularly within ageism. \nAnother contextual example for you would be someone well qualified for a job being rejected because they are \u201cof a certain age\u201d and they are \u201coverqualified\u201d. \n\nPerhaps rather than mocking someone for trying to give you some information to improve your understanding of the language you use and why people may not take kindly to ityou should try being less judgmental.\n\nI\u2019ll be sure to remember your username so next time you\u2019re being ignorant about your choice of words I\u2019ll be sure not to suggest otherwise, let you make a fool of yourself and find out the hard way. :)",

I can give you more example. Like, Temari, she is from Kazekage clan which is the 5th strogest clan in the whole \"Naruto series\" (according to cbr.com). But after marrying Shikamaru she was considered as a Nara clan member and their child was named after Nara clan \"Shikadai Nara\". If the naming concept would be by importance of clan then Temari's clan is far stronger than Nara clan. They shouldn't use Nara as surname. \n\nPoint to be noted, Temari didn't use a clan name or surname before marriage.  But after marrying Shikamaru, she used the clan name of her husband just like the japanese naming system. It's proof that in \" Naruto\" series they used japanese naming system. And that's why child's surname should be given by it's father's surname. It also applies for Naruto... ////\n\n<https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbr.com/naruto-strongest-clans-ranked-by-strength/amp/>",

I can give you more example. Like, Temari, she is from Kazekage clan which is the 5th strogest clan in the whole \"Naruto series\" (according to cbr.com). But after marrying Shikamaru she was considered as a Nara clan member and their child was named after Nara clan \"Shikadai Nara\". If the naming concept would be by importance of clan then Temari's clan is far stronger than Nara clan. They shouldn't use Nara as surname. \n\nPoint to be noted, Temari didn't use a clan name or surname before marriage.  But after marrying Shikamaru, she used the clan name of her husband just like the japanese naming system. It's proof that in \" Naruto\" series they used japanese naming system. And that's why child's surname should be given by it's father's surname. It also applies for Naruto... ////\n\n<https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbr.com/naruto-strongest-clans-ranked-by-strength/amp/>",

If they didn't follow japanese naming system as you told before, Temari won't change her name after marriage. \nEven they could give no surname to Shikadai but did that happen?  Shikadai got a surname from his father. \n\nYou'll also notice that in Choji's case. Choji's wife Karui got a surname after marriage. \n\nBut there is an exception in Ino-Sai case. As Sai is from no clan, their son Inujin got a surname from Yamanaka clan. In my openion, this exception is acceptable as Sai is not from any clan and he has no family background.",

Like, Temari, she is from Kazekage clan which is the 5th strogest clan in the whole \"Naruto series\" (according to cbr.com). But after marrying Shikamaru she was considered as a Nara clan member and their child was named after Nara clan \"Shikadai Nara\". If the naming concept would be by importance of clan then Temari's clan is far stronger than Nara clan. They shouldn't use Nara as surname. \n\nPoint to be noted, Temari didn't use a clan name or surname before marriage.  But after marrying Shikamaru, she used the clan name of her husband just like the japanese naming system. It's proof that in \" Naruto\" series they used japanese naming system. And that's why child's surname should be given by it's father's surname. It also applies for Naruto... ////\n\n<https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbr.com/naruto-strongest-clans-ranked-by-strength/amp/>",

I explained to you in a perfectly decent manner why it\u2019s not ideal to say if you were actually talking to and/or about real people.\n\nIt is a widely used term, particularly within ageism. \nAnother contextual example for you would be someone well qualified for a job being rejected because they are \u201cof a certain age\u201d and they are \u201coverqualified\u201d. \n\nPerhaps rather than mocking someone for trying to give you some information to improve your understanding of the language you use and why people may not take kindly to ityou should try being less judgmental.\n\nI\u2019ll be sure to remember your username so next time you\u2019re being ignorant about your choice of words I\u2019ll be sure not to suggest otherwise, let you make a fool of yourself and find out the hard way. :)",

Like, Temari, she is from Kazekage clan which is the 5th strogest clan in the whole \"Naruto series\" (according to cbr.com). But after marrying Shikamaru she was considered as a Nara clan member and their child was named after Nara clan \"Shikadai Nara\". If the naming concept would be by importance of clan then Temari's clan is far stronger than Nara clan. They shouldn't use Nara as surname. \n\nPoint to be noted, Temari didn't use a clan name or surname before marriage.  But after marrying Shikamaru, she used the clan name of her husband just like the japanese naming system. It's proof that in \" Naruto\" series they used japanese naming system. And that's why child's surname should be given by it's father's surname. It also applies for Naruto... ////\n\n<https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbr.com/naruto-strongest-clans-ranked-by-strength/amp/>",

If they didn't follow japanese naming system as you told before, Temari won't change her name after marriage. \nEven they could give no surname to Shikadai but did that happen?  Shikadai got a surname from his father. \n\nYou'll also notice that in Choji's case. Choji's wife Karui got a surname after marriage. \n\nBut there is an exception in Ino-Sai case. As Sai is from no clan, their son Inujin got a surname from Yamanaka clan. In my openion, this exception is acceptable as Sai is not from any clan and he has no family background.",
