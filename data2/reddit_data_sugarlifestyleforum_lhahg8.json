    "body": " \n\nB\n\nI  can't believe it's been five years since you came into my life. I will never forget the first time that I saw your pictures. Your smile got my  attention but it was your big beautiful green  eyes grabbed my heart. Seeing you ice skating and hunting I knew you  weren't the typical woman.\n\nFor whatever reason you decided to meet me. Hitting a deer on the way to meet you wasn't going to stop me from meeting you. From that night on I wanted to get to know you. I could tell you were special and talented.\u00a0\n\nSlowly  we became friends and earned each others trust. I saw you grow as a  person and a woman. You just needed a break and guidance\n\nI  always told you that I didn't believe in love. I knew my cancer would  come back and I never wanted someone to love and care about me then me die on them.\u00a0\n\nAs  hard as I fought I will always remember the night I realized that I did love you. Holding you in my arms as you cried as you shared your feelings with me. Since that night I have wanted the best for you. Helping you succeed and find yourself.\n\nYou have been an amazing friend, lover and motivator for me. Always supporting me as I shared my dreams with you. We bring out the best in each other. I have never shared the type of relationship that we have.\u00a0\n\nThe  last three years since we have been close have been the best years of  my life. Seeing you and hearing your voice always puts a smile on my face and makes my heart beat faster.\u00a0\n\nWorking together to build our business while I mentor you has been the most fun I have ever had while working.\u00a0\n\nThe  last six months have been hard on you. I am sorry that you had to go through some toughest times of my life. You could of left and I would of understood. You didn't. You have been beside  my side as I fought for my life. You giving me the courage and will to live.\n\nThen  you saved my life. Picking me up off our floor and taking me to the ER. How do you thank someone that does that? When they  thought I wasn't going to make it through the night you were there for me. I couldn't leave without seeing you one last  time.\u00a0My nurse could tell how much we cared about each other. I wasn't supposed to live through the night but i lived because I wasn't ready to leave you.\n\nI  never want to leave you but I know I will someday. I will know that you  are going to be successful with a happy life and future. I won't be by your side but will always be with you.\n\nYou have shown me how much you love and care about me. You know how much I love and care about you.\n\nI look forward to our next five years.\n\nD",
