Not sure if I\u2019m feeling the goatee. \n\nYou definitely should have the sides of your hair trimmed down next cut. Tapered is fine but I\u2019d caution you on the fade, as a high fade with a diamond shaped face like yours could make your cheekbones stand out a bit more than you\u2019d like. I would take the bulk out of the sides though. \n\nGreat changes have been made my friend. Keep it up.  ",

I know frames are expensive, so my advice is just that you keep an open mind and try some different options whenever you shop for new frames again.\n\nI think you should attempt a fade at least once. Here's my reasoning: hair grows back. If you don't like it, just wait a couple of weeks.\n\nWhat equipment are you using for facial hair maintenance?",

Am I missing anything essential or do you have any product recommendations you would give?\n\nThanks for the earlier message.",

I'm sure if you ask the sub you'll get a range of opinions.\n\nI recommend this beard trimmer. It has an easy adjust length, and gives you precision down to half millimeter increments. \n\nhttps://tinyurl.com/y9wzn6zn\n\nWith a trimmer like that, you can maintain a short stubble beard which I think would work very well for you.\n\nI also think you need a beard brush. This helps avoid the homeless guy beard look. You just brush the hairs straight after you get out of the shower. Total time needed is about 3 seconds.\n\nhttps://tinyurl.com/y7fmfh6f\n\nOils? Some people are into them. That's your choice. Depending on your skin, you may want beard cream (not sure if your skin gets irritated/dry). Beards wick the oils away from your face, so some people get face dandruff. ",
