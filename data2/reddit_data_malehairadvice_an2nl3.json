If you don't like them, see if you find any other glasses that compliment your look better. Square glasses aren't really that great looking\n\nEdit:how's your wardrobe? I just noticed you're using some sort of neck warmer on a hooded sweatshirt. That a big nono my dude.\n\nBuy a few colored scarves, red preferably. Scarves, togheter with socks, need to drag a lot of attention. Any primary color will do.\n\nI would never, ever, use an hooded sweatshirt under a jacket. The only instance in which you could pull that look, is if you're wearing a tight black leather jacket, and you need to be somewhat fit to look good in one.\n\nAlso once you do shave your head off, beanies will be your best friends.

For the brave, a little pattern on the bottom half, such as pinstripes or checks, can also be a perfect choice\n\nFor some good hoodies, two brands that come to my mind are definitely high street and street wear. \n\n",

Just wanted to say I know it's tough losing your hair this early, it's really shaken me up and made me think a lot about my identity/how I view myself (this may sound stupid, but I never once imagined my future kids having never known me with hair). It's so, so scary and honestly a little depressing to come to terms with such bad genetics. I feel ya.<3",

With the look you've got on the right, \"Hitman\" is definitely not something on my mind.\n\nThe other thing is that you could grow out some stubble for a \"warmer\" look, and try different beard styles. Those would make big difference on the other end. *I* certainly don't think you look intimidating or \"deadly\" in the pic on the right.",

For the brave, a little pattern on the bottom half, such as pinstripes or checks, can also be a perfect choice\n\nFor some good hoodies, two brands that come to my mind are definitely high street and street wear. \n\n",

For the brave, a little pattern on the bottom half, such as pinstripes or checks, can also be a perfect choice\n\nFor some good hoodies, two brands that come to my mind are definitely high street and street wear. \n\n",
