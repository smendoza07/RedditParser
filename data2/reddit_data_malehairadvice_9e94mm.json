Had my eyes closed to keep the hair from falling in, next thing i know i feel the clipper against the skin going way too deep. Already too late.  Didn\u2019t ask for either. \n\nGonna just go back to cutting it myself.  It\u2019s easy enough if i get another two mirror setup. This is the last time getting a shitty cut.  Ive actually had this happen once before at one of my town\u2019s leading buzz/fade shops. That was even worse as he gave me the super deep Jude Law hairline. ",

I found out quickly if you want quality haircuts, you gotta pay for it. I wouldn't give up on good barbers. \n\nWalk into the busiest barber shop on a weekend and just watch. If you find someone you like then request them and tell straight up you've been burned before and be specific on what you want. And if you can't explain it, show them a picture. \n\nI use to think that would lame as fuck comparing pictures of my hair to some other guys, but fuck it.

I found out quickly if you want quality haircuts, you gotta pay for it. I wouldn't give up on good barbers. \n\nWalk into the busiest barber shop on a weekend and just watch. If you find someone you like then request them and tell straight up you've been burned before and be specific on what you want. And if you can't explain it, show them a picture. \n\nI use to think that would lame as fuck comparing pictures of my hair to some other guys, but fuck it. You want to go through this bullshit feeling again? ",
