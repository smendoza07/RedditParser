I recently got ACF because it was rated well on Amazon, said high-hold, low-shine, matte finish (which sounds perfect for what I'm going for, I think), didn't realize the circlejerk, and it's working well (I think). And I've been asking for shorter on the sides at the barber just because that seems like what's in style. So I'm basically doing exactly what you're joking about. Is there just always a better option, or what's with the circlejerk?",

I like it somewhat and it does offer decent hold (I use it with hairspray) but I hate the shine that it adds to my hair. Ordered some of this hoping that it solves the issue and if not, I guess I'm only out $10. \n\n\nMy hair isn't super long or anything. I keep it shorter on the sides and longer on top but my hair is just long enough to where it covers my eyebrows when it's wet. Kind of going for the type of look that the dudes in the images at the top of this sub have. I'm optimistic that this will give me a bit more of what I want than gel does. ",

They wanted a product that would keep their locks stylin' while they were out on the waters, to demonstrate the superiority of American follicles to their opponents. This also explains why ACF has such low hold: first, because the rowers were legally prohibited from having hair longer than two inches, and second, because they wanted a product that was \"lightweight\" like them. Developing such a product proved surprisingly difficult: private contractors couldn't create the right level of hold even after five years of research and development. Eventually, NASA was assigned to work on the product as the crew team's morale was growing dangerously low, creating a risk that the Russian national team could beat them. After the 1968 Olympics, NASA realized that they'd made way too much hair product and decided to sell the excess on the open market. They created a shell company, named \"American Crew\" after the product's origins, and marketed the product as \"Fiber,\" a reference to the high levels of fiber present in an athlete's diet.",

They wanted a product that would keep their locks stylin' while they were out on the waters, to demonstrate the superiority of American follicles to their opponents. This also explains why ACF has such low hold: first, because the rowers were legally prohibited from having hair longer than two inches, and second, because they wanted a product that was \"lightweight\" like them. Developing such a product proved surprisingly difficult: private contractors couldn't create the right level of hold even after five years of research and development. Eventually, NASA was assigned to work on the product as the crew team's morale was growing dangerously low, creating a risk that the Russian national team could beat them. After the 1968 Olympics, NASA realized that they'd made way too much hair product and decided to sell the excess on the open market. They created a shell company, named \"American Crew\" after the product's origins, and marketed the product as \"Fiber,\" a reference to the high levels of fiber present in an athlete's diet.",

They wanted a product that would keep their locks stylin' while they were out on the waters, to demonstrate the superiority of American follicles to their opponents. This also explains why ACF has such low hold: first, because the rowers were legally prohibited from having hair longer than two inches, and second, because they wanted a product that was \"lightweight\" like them. Developing such a product proved surprisingly difficult: private contractors couldn't create the right level of hold even after five years of research and development. Eventually, NASA was assigned to work on the product as the crew team's morale was growing dangerously low, creating a risk that the Russian national team could beat them. After the 1968 Olympics, NASA realized that they'd made way too much hair product and decided to sell the excess on the open market. They created a shell company, named \"American Crew\" after the product's origins, and marketed the product as \"Fiber,\" a reference to the high levels of fiber present in an athlete's diet.",

They wanted a product that would keep their locks stylin' while they were out on the waters, to demonstrate the superiority of American follicles to their opponents. This also explains why ACF has such low hold: first, because the rowers were legally prohibited from having hair longer than two inches, and second, because they wanted a product that was \"lightweight\" like them. Developing such a product proved surprisingly difficult: private contractors couldn't create the right level of hold even after five years of research and development. Eventually, NASA was assigned to work on the product as the crew team's morale was growing dangerously low, creating a risk that the Russian national team could beat them. After the 1968 Olympics, NASA realized that they'd made way too much hair product and decided to sell the excess on the open market. They created a shell company, named \"American Crew\" after the product's origins, and marketed the product as \"Fiber,\" a reference to the high levels of fiber present in an athlete's diet.",

They wanted a product that would keep their locks stylin' while they were out on the waters, to demonstrate the superiority of American follicles to their opponents. This also explains why ACF has such low hold: first, because the rowers were legally prohibited from having hair longer than two inches, and second, because they wanted a product that was \"lightweight\" like them. Developing such a product proved surprisingly difficult: private contractors couldn't create the right level of hold even after five years of research and development.
