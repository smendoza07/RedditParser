Thought we were tight, had a good sr.\n\nGuess I was wrong, Christmas came I got her a great gift that she had talked about when we were out and about one day a couple of months before.  She got me nothing.  I reevaluated my relationship with her from that point on.  Dumped her in February as she had dropped the ball more than once since not giving me even a card for Christmas.\n\nHeard from her months later as she could not find a sd that she liked as much as me.  Told her sorry I have a new sb and she should have cared about our sr when it was going on.  Hopefully she learned a lesson to not take people for granted.",
