            "body": "Haha he\u2019s above BTS and IU. Really a testament to his popularity. \n\nUnsurprised though, he\u2019s got an inspiring backstory about struggling for 10 years before finally breaking out as the grasshopper. Then even while popular his record remained extremely clean - the biggest scandal I remember about him in recent years was when he got criticised for having his hands in his pockets while talking to a taxi driver while on camera. That is a little rude but also shows there\u2019s no material available to scandalise him lol.\n\nEdit: oh wow, apologies for whatever\u2019s happened below. I just looked at the list and pointed out the top 3, especially since 2 of those are well known outside of Korea (ie *us*) so it\u2019s a good quick gauge of just how insanely popular Jaesuk is, which is what we\u2019re celebrating here. \n\nPlease don\u2019t fight below my comment... and for new redditors seeing this feel free to just skip past the next wall of text & the whole comment thread if you don\u2019t want to see anything to do w kpop here because it\u2019s r/runningman. \n\nRegarding whether bts is actually popular among the gp - this survey was done by Sports Korea ie people who likely aren\u2019t into kpop stuff at all. I originally had that in my comment but didn\u2019t want to talk too long in the beginning line about people unrelated to our sub. But because of whatever downvoting nonsense happened below I feel I have to clarify some things. \n\nBTS got popular among the korean gp for being popular overseas - their international fame and success in America is what made them well known locally because they\u2019ve raised the cultural status for Korea. They got a lot of domestic attention particularly when their president congratulated them a couple years ago for the no. 1 on billboard. \n\nIU is an darling among domestic Korean singers and queen of the charts - absolutely no one holds a candle to her. She\u2019s not as huge to the western audience mainly because she\u2019s never promoted anywhere internationally besides Japan/Taiwan (unlike idol groups who have been trying to enter US/China for years now), yet she still has a substantial fanbase within the english-speaking kpop fandom. If she ever tries breaking into America, she\u2019d probably do pretty well, though she doesn\u2019t seem interested in doing so at all so we'd never know. \n\nBoth are successful and popular in their own ways among the locals. **But Jaesuk reigns supreme over all that jazz for the third year running**. That says something about our dear Nation MC. Let\u2019s just celebrate that instead of arguing over whether who\u2019s actually popular or not, because they\u2019re all irrelevant here. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for even bringing up the other positions. And really sorry for the huge rant in the edit. It\u2019s just irritating for me to see how you can\u2019t even bring up kpop idols without causing kpop fandom drama just from a namedrop. Thought rm fans would be more chill about this given we\u2019re all generally older but I guess not.",
