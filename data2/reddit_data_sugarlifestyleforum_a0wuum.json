    "body": "We\u2019ve all had bad dates.  Sometimes they\u2019re funny, sometimes they\u2019re downright horrible.  I\u2019ve seen many a post from SDs talking about a cringe worthy meet and greet with an SB.  I\u2019ve also seen more than a few \u201cfirst meet and greet tomorrow, what do I do?!\u201d posts from the SB side.  So I figured hey, why the hell not spice up the feed and drop some knowledge.\n\n\n-BE ON TIME. Best case scenario, be a few minutes early.  It shows that you\u2019re organized and have yourself together.  Being late is rude and shows you probably don\u2019t take this very seriously.  \n\n-Make sure you smile.  Smiling make you seem much more friendly and approachable.  People like people who make them feel good.  Work on an inviting demeanor. \n\n-Don\u2019t be on your phone.  Just don\u2019t do it.  Easiest thing to do is just put it away.  You don\u2019t want to seem distracted and being glued to your phone is going to make them feel like they need to compete for your attention, which is no fun.\n\n-Walk with confidence.  Make sure you sit with good posture.  Being all slouched over is not cute.\n\n-Keep your elbows off the table.  Napkin on your lap.  Come on now.  \n\n-Up your vocabulary.  Within reason, obviously.  Stay away from r/iamverysmart levels.  Try not to use a bunch of slang.  Stay away from cursing until you know how it will be received.  I love the word fuck as much as the next person but I\u2019m probably not going to drop it until I know he don\u2019t clutch his pearls in horror.  \n\n-Eat slowly and chew with your mouth closed.  Don\u2019t talk with your mouth full.  Basic manners.\n\n-Make sure you\u2019re well groomed.  Your hair should be brushed and styled.  Put some effort into your makeup and outfit.  Dates are not the time to show up in leggings and a t shirt.  Keep your nails clean and maintained!  So gross how many people I\u2019ve seen with dirt under their nails.  I get a mani/pedi regularly, but that\u2019s not completely necessary.  Just make sure they\u2019re trimmed and neat.  \n\n-This goes without saying, but the way you look matters.  You don\u2019t need to break the bank on outfits if you don\u2019t want to, but you should invest in classic pieces that go with everything and that you can get a lot of use out of.  Make sure it\u2019s clean and well fitted.  Dress appropriately for the venue and the weather.  Don\u2019t show off way too much skin. \n\n-Don\u2019t get super drunk.  Sloppy behavior is never cute.  It is not safe and can impair your decision making and Impulse control.  It\u2019s trashy and it\u2019s embarrassing to you and your date.   Nothing says discreet like a belligerent date.  \n\n-Be gracious. Ask questions.  Be engaging.  Be mature.  Remember, you want to convince this person that you\u2019re worth investing in/spending time with.\n\n-Try to make a point to talk less about yourself. Ask questions, people love to talk about themselves.  Be engaging and don\u2019t interrupt. Share things that you\u2019re interested in as well.\n\n-Don\u2019t be negative.  No one likes people who are gossipy or rude to other people.  No one likes people who make them feel bad.\n\n-Try to stay up on current events, at the very least it gives you something to talk about.  Read more and stay informed.  \n\n-Look people in the eyes when speaking/being spoken to.  Confidence is so key.  People can pick up on insecurity and it can make you an easy target.  If you aren\u2019t naturally confident, fake it til you make it.  It eventually becomes habit.  Sugaring has made me so much more confident and for that I\u2019m grateful.  \n\n\nThree cheers to being more civilized \ud83c\udf89\n\nEdit: if anything else has anything want to add to this, feel free.  What are your pet peeves that seem so obvious yet a lot of people fail to grasp?",

Are you both going to like the same foods, enjoy travel to the same destinations, enjoy talking about the same TV shows (or not), etc. - don\u2019t let the conversation be one-sided.\n\n- If you like the girl or guy then be flirty! Giggle, laugh, compliment their hair or smile (don\u2019t be fucking creepy). Girls, you can lightly brush their arm if the situation is going well (also don\u2019t be creepy) to show interest",

(this is a problem in my country which is socially   \n  conservative).  \n\\- Be comfortable.

One was wearing leggings, boots, nice top, the whole outfit looked pulled together and sexy.  I think \"no leggings\" is a good general rule, maybe not everyone can pull off \"leggings as part of an outfit where it works in a nice bar\"",

Ask questions, people love to talk about themselves.\n\n\"People love to talk about themselves\" is one of those common wisdoms that, IME, is not true, for a whole lot of people ... at least when it comes to interacting with strangers.  I don't love talking about myself to strangers.  Don't get me wrong, our conversation at the M&G will be fun and interactive with lots of laughing and great stories (at least ideally), and I'm sure you'll learn plenty about me through that, but very little of the type of conversation that's evoked when someone hears \"ask questions, people love to talk about themselves\" ... with a stranger, I'm not interested in a more one-way conversation where I do most of the talking for most of the time, like talking about my family, or my career path, or going through a list of my hobbies.  By contrast, I enjoy if she talks about herself, as long as it doesn't get to the point where it's self-indulgent.  Most of my M&G conversation is highly interactive (you'll learn a lot about me through that), and in addition she can talk about herself as much as she wants, and I will talk about myself not as much.  I don't think I'm terribly unique in that.\n\nSo, if your date is engaged and animated when you talk about yourself, but quickly turns the conversation back around when you ask \"and tell me all about your job\", no reason to keep pressing, you're doing fine.   Even with my long-term SB, beyond  interactive conversation, she talks about herself a lot, I talk about myself a little, and we both love it that way.",
