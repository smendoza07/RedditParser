    "body": "I have no where else to share this, and I know it might be a bit much for some, but I am really excited and have to share because I don't want to tell anyone in my \"normal\" life! I just set a date with my sd for a gang bang! We have been together for about 5 months, and have discussed my willingness for others to join us in the bedroom. I am bisexual, and he and his wife used to swing. I have expressed that my biggest fantasy is having 2 men go down on me at the same time, and my SD has been game for it. Last week, he mentioned possibly bringing some other men into the bedroom. The more we talked about it, the hornier I got, and I told him I really wanted to do it! I've brought it up pretty much every day since lol He asked 3 guys, all of them are in, and today we set the date for April 12th! I am a little bit nervous but I honestly cannot wait! My SD is amazing and always respectful, and he said all of these guys will be the same. No issues with protection being used (like obviously!) He is going to book a nice hotel room (with a big bathtub, as I requested) and the day after we are taking work off to enjoy a spa day :) I'm really happy my SD can give me new experiences to enjoy!",

You have to talk to your significant other, like reallllly talk, BEFORE yall ever take that leap, bc the outcome can be weird otherwise.\nMy 1st time was with my ex and very best friend.  I knew everyone she had been with and vice versa, bc we had been besties for 16 yrs. It was a freakin ammmmmmazing experience, DURING the actual experience.....Afterwards tho.....uggggggg\n\nI had no trouble with my bestie, whenever I saw her the next day....we both discussed it, didnt feel any differently, had a great time together, it was just my ex who made shit super weird afterwards.\n\nHe started getting jealous of me spending the same amount of girl time that I used to spend with her....\nYa know....going shoppin, coffees, and mani/pedis together...he kept askin or downright saying that \"I wanted HER, MORE THAN HIM!\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nGuys can pull the \"stupidest shit\" card sometimes!\nTHIS is why you have to have \"the talk,\" prior to actual engagements/encounters.  \nIf I had been a mentally weak minded person, my ex wouldve killed EVERYTHING for me, bc he wouldnt shut up for the longest time over just retarded jealousy!",
