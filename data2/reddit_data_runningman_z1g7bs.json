Great episode with great guests all around but So-Min was still the most memorable back then, rolling sideways and craving a beer after swimming. \n\nShe was a really charming guest. \n\nAnd oh boy do I miss Kang Gary. It was the right decision for him to leave but he brought us good times and a lot of laughter. He was always the most real, the least tv-personality of the cast. Hope he is doing well and enjoying life with his family.",
