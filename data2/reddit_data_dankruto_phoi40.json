Her affection grew from shallow interest. \n\nAnd Naruto was a weird ass kid. Hinata desired him for his good points, but that's because she was the only one who paid close attention to him. It makes no sense for Sakura to want to hang out with someone who is literally the bottom of the barrel in terms of academics and social standing, just because that kid liked her. She knew nothing about him. Naruto's love for her was the same as hers for Sasuke at the time. Shallow, and likewise it wouldve made no sense for Sasuke to want to hang out with Sakura, just because she liked him. \n\nKids are allowed to like who they want. Sakura was mean to Naruto, which was hard to watch at times, but it makes sense given that Naruto had no visibly redeeming qualities. He just shouted random shit about wanting to be hokage with nothing to prove for it. By the time Naruto got around to saving Sakura in the Zabuza fight, aka her first real time seeing Naruto being able to do something if I remember correctly, her relationship with Naruto had already solidified into what it is: slightly verbally abusive, but honestly pretty realistic for a bossy high school aged girl. \n\nShe slowly grew as a character. She became less harsh as she learned to see more of the world than just what was in front of her. And she and Naruto became friends.",

And he never told her. \n\nHe basically convinced her that she had a chance with Sasuke. She was a lonely girl who wanted to get with the popular guy, and Naruto solidified the idea in her head that she could be Sasuke's. \n\nSakura is beloved by fans because she embodies the fantasy of a young girls: the idea that a normal girl has a chance to stand amongst the cool kids, or rather the members of team 7. Sakura's attempts at being as good of a ninja as her teammates never really went far, but the fact that she tried anyway and that her teammates still values her despite her flaws, meant a lot to younger girls reading Naruto.

Naruto only connected with Gaara in OG Naruto cause their experiences were pretty similar and they were both just seen as weapons by their respective nations . He didnt empathize with Zabuza,Orochimaru,Kimimaro and Kabuto in OG at all . Same goes for all other villains he fought in Shippuden till he fought Pain . He also wanted to kill Pain but Pain changed him completely as a person (Minato too because of what he said to him when he stopped his Nine Tails Transformation) . And after fighting Pain , Naruto instantly started understanding Sasuke a lot better and tried to save him the correct way . You cant expect a 12 year old kid to understand how much anothet 12 year kid has gone through. Sasuke also never understood how much pain Naruto was going through while leaving the village . So your reasoning here is completely incorrect and is undermining Naruto's character a lot imo .",

                                    "body": "OK, maybe I worded my statement wrong, my point is that Naruto will always try to appeal to those who act as his foil, people who are a different side of him he thankfully rejected before it consumed him, he does this to those special people he feels a kinship with despite the fact that they're trying to kill him. Obito and Gaara were the mass murderers I was referring so technically I'm still right. He wouldn't do this with Kimimaro because he was focused on Sasuke and Kimimaro has no qualities that reflect Naruto in any way, he doesn't Kabuto because Kabuto took his job so seriously as a spy he's essentially a blank page, he's only with Orochimaru because he's so manipulative, on the topic of Orochimaru,  he's the evil who he's tryingto save Sasuke from, so of course he wouldn't stop to think ask Orochimaruwhy he's doing everything he has. The whole Zabuza mission, narratively speaking, was to show Naruto the reality of being a shinobi, the types of people he'd come across on his journey and I personally think it's seeing Haku, a person who seemed nice in Naruto's perspective, be such a villain that he was supposed to understand its going to be a long road for him and I think it was seeing how much Zabuza cared for him that showed Naruto that his enemies are people as well.\n\nOn to Shippuden,  most of Naruto's enemies were just a part of his personal growth, they themselves were not meant to hold Naruto's attention in the same way Gaara and Neji had. Deidara and Sasori aren't Naruto's villain,  they the villains of the arc, but Naruto's main enemy was his failure to save Gaara, it was supposed to remind him that just because he has a bit more ability as a ninja he still has long way to go to actually improve and save Sasuke. We see just how much he has to grow after Sasuke makes short work of him. Hidan was for Shikamaru's personal growth he needed to step up and be a leader and get over his fear of his comrades dying after the Sasuke retrieval failure so Naruto has nothing to do with that. Kakuzy was just to show that Naruto had bridged the gap between him and Sasuke at least in terms of power so he could have a chance to get through to him. I agree with you on your point about Pain so I have nothing to say on that.\n\nTo counter your points about Sasuke, first of all I can expect Naruto to see what Sasuke is going through since he had seen what to other 12 year olds were going through(Neji and Gaara) and acted accordingly, he just didn't want to because he wasn't really thinking about saving Sasuke,  at least not completely,  it was more about his worst fear coming true: the only person who understood him was leaving and he would be alone again. That's why I say he tried to manipulate Sasuke. In fact actually trying to understand Sasuke from the get go would have work because he listens when people see his perspective, Kakashi tells him to stop chasing Itachi and Sasuke considers letting go of his hatred after hearing that everyone Kakashi has ever cared about is dead. He only became Obito's errand boy and feel into his manipulation because he was told the truth of what led to the massacre of his clan he even joined Orochimaru specifically because the snake exploited his feelings of inferiority and his desire for revenge. \n\nAlso,  Sasuke knew exactly what Naruto was feeling, he understood but he didn't care because the whole point of leaving the village was to cut ties with everyone. In fact, this goes back to my point of Naruto being the one not to understand Sasuke,  he literally says Naruto has been alone his whole life so he'll never understand what it's like to have people taken from him, which is correct because Naruto doesn't know what love is and therefore cannot understand Sasuke's need for revenge. \n\nSo with all this in mind,  I'm not incorrect and I'm not undermining Naruto's character at all",

This 12 year old also got another kid to stop being a psychopath who only finds meaning in life through killing others and actually let go of his past trauma and build relationships he never had before. If Naruto was emotionally mature enough to do all that, he could take second to see why this wasn't something that Sasuke could just get over, but he actively chose not to. And at no point did anyone consider killing Sasuke it was all about not letting Orochimaru get an Uchiha, at least for Konoha anyways, so it still wasn't about Sasuke's protection but rather about not letting the village's greatest enemy have something that could make him more powerful",

But some of sasukes lines come off as cliche and are executed well. \n\nWhile we are on the topic of narutos dub, can we all acknowledge how great gaaras dub is? Like gaara, madara and gai are probally the best dubs in the series. And for different reasons. Gaaras dub comes off as emotional in shipuden, and every word he says has meaning and you can feel it. You can feel the fear, sadness or anger in his voice at any given time. Madaras dub is just fucking powerful. I actually watched a side by side of his dub and sub, and I prefer the dub because it comes off as boomier if that makes sense. He just sounds like an actual world ending threat. And gai encompasses passion and silliness. It fits his character so well.",

He acknowledges Naruto as a worthy opponent in the Chunin Exams and wanted to die to save Naruto/Sakura from Gaara. He wouldn't have left if it wasn't for the Sound Four or Itachi putting him under tsukuyomi. Naruto spent one month training to bring Tsunade so she could heal Sasuke. \n\nBut the issue is Kishimoto's editors rushed him into the Chunin Exams when he wanted to do another arc like the Waves before. \n\nAlso, I personally did not see a \"deep connection\" between Orochimaru and Jiraiya but you're entitled to your own opinion.",

You may be mature enough to see the bullshit in Sakura's story but you don't understand how easily children are influenced. \n\nAs for Naruto, he doesn't chase that said thug out of superficial love in hope that he'll turn good, he actively tries to bring that person in the right path.

In Shippuden, we see Naruto realize Sakura is simply not for him when he rejects her outright, right after the arc where he finally realized Hinata liked him. Yeah, it took a few more years to develop that into a relationship, but it\u2019s not like Naruto wasn\u2019t a little busy for most of that time to be thinking about a romantic relationship at that point.",

                    "body": "Naruto treated her like trash as well. Dude impersonated Sasuke and nearly assaulted her by going in for a kiss. That's... super fucked up. \n\nAnd of course she treated him like trash. Remember at the beginning of the series in the academy where Naruto didn't have any friends? You have to look at the story from Sakura's perspective. Naruto was that kid in every class who doesn't pay attention, always interrupts, has no respect for authority, was failing his classes, and was getting in trouble with everyone up to the hokage. He was basically that kid everyone expects will end up in jail one day.\n\nHer whole life prior to team 7 was characterized by everyone avoiding Naruto, and the adults explained to her that his behavior was because he was an orphan. Why should she have treated him like a king? Why should she have been in love with him, for no reason? He was already a delinquent who all the adults hated, who was hitting on her despite her clearly not liking him. Why should a 12 year old be so mature to be able to see past the lies people told about Naruto so quickly? Once she learned about Naruto and the 9 tails, she got nicer. But prior to that, Naruto was literally a failure in her eyes. We only care about him and his crush for Sakura because we love underdogs and the show made sure we knew how depressed and pitiful Naruto was. Sakura didn't have any of that knowledge. He was that kid nobody liked, who wasn't amounting to anything, who liked her and therefore was bringing her already shitty image down as well. And then he got friendzoned. \n\nI wouldn't be super crazy over Naruto as well. \n\nAlso Sakura isn't comparing her life to Naruto's. They have a healthy adult friendship. I hate to imagine living your life jealous of your friends accomplishments or having someone jealous of yohrs. That's not something to be proud of.",

It makes no sense for Sakura to want to hang out with someone who is literally the bottom of the barrel in terms of academics and social standing, just because that kid liked her. She knew nothing about him. Naruto's love for her was the same as hers for Sasuke at the time. Shallow, and likewise it wouldve made no sense for Sasuke to want to hang out with Sakura, just because she liked him. \n\nKids are allowed to like who they want. Sakura was mean to Naruto, which was hard to watch at times, but it makes sense given that Naruto had no visibly redeeming qualities. He just shouted random shit about wanting to be hokage with nothing to prove for it. By the time Naruto got around to saving Sakura in the Zabuza fight, aka her first real time seeing Naruto being able to do something if I remember correctly, her relationship with Naruto had already solidified into what it is: slightly verbally abusive, but honestly pretty realistic for a bossy high school aged girl. \n\nShe slowly grew as a character. She became less harsh as she learned to see more of the world than just what was in front of her. And she and Naruto became friends.",

And he never told her. \n\nHe basically convinced her that she had a chance with Sasuke. She was a lonely girl who wanted to get with the popular guy, and Naruto solidified the idea in her head that she could be Sasuke's. \n\nSakura is beloved by fans because she embodies the fantasy of a young girls: the idea that a normal girl has a chance to stand amongst the cool kids, or rather the members of team 7. Sakura's attempts at being as good of a ninja as her teammates never really went far, but the fact that she tried anyway and that her teammates still values her despite her flaws, meant a lot to younger girls reading Naruto. She's not unique in that she's a member of team 7, she's unique in that she never got overpowered, and therefore she remained somewhat relatable to female readers throughout the entire series.",

Naruto only connected with Gaara in OG Naruto cause their experiences were pretty similar and they were both just seen as weapons by their respective nations . He didnt empathize with Zabuza,Orochimaru,Kimimaro and Kabuto in OG at all . Same goes for all other villains he fought in Shippuden till he fought Pain . He also wanted to kill Pain but Pain changed him completely as a person (Minato too because of what he said to him when he stopped his Nine Tails Transformation) . And after fighting Pain , Naruto instantly started understanding Sasuke a lot better and tried to save him the correct way . You cant expect a 12 year old kid to understand how much anothet 12 year kid has gone through. Sasuke also never understood how much pain Naruto was going through while leaving the village . So your reasoning here is completely incorrect and is undermining Naruto's character a lot imo .",

                            "body": "OK, maybe I worded my statement wrong, my point is that Naruto will always try to appeal to those who act as his foil, people who are a different side of him he thankfully rejected before it consumed him, he does this to those special people he feels a kinship with despite the fact that they're trying to kill him. Obito and Gaara were the mass murderers I was referring so technically I'm still right. He wouldn't do this with Kimimaro because he was focused on Sasuke and Kimimaro has no qualities that reflect Naruto in any way, he doesn't Kabuto because Kabuto took his job so seriously as a spy he's essentially a blank page, he's only with Orochimaru because he's so manipulative, on the topic of Orochimaru,  he's the evil who he's tryingto save Sasuke from, so of course he wouldn't stop to think ask Orochimaruwhy he's doing everything he has. The whole Zabuza mission, narratively speaking, was to show Naruto the reality of being a shinobi, the types of people he'd come across on his journey and I personally think it's seeing Haku, a person who seemed nice in Naruto's perspective, be such a villain that he was supposed to understand its going to be a long road for him and I think it was seeing how much Zabuza cared for him that showed Naruto that his enemies are people as well.\n\nOn to Shippuden,  most of Naruto's enemies were just a part of his personal growth, they themselves were not meant to hold Naruto's attention in the same way Gaara and Neji had. Deidara and Sasori aren't Naruto's villain,  they the villains of the arc, but Naruto's main enemy was his failure to save Gaara, it was supposed to remind him that just because he has a bit more ability as a ninja he still has long way to go to actually improve and save Sasuke. We see just how much he has to grow after Sasuke makes short work of him. Hidan was for Shikamaru's personal growth he needed to step up and be a leader and get over his fear of his comrades dying after the Sasuke retrieval failure so Naruto has nothing to do with that. Kakuzy was just to show that Naruto had bridged the gap between him and Sasuke at least in terms of power so he could have a chance to get through to him. I agree with you on your point about Pain so I have nothing to say on that.\n\nTo counter your points about Sasuke, first of all I can expect Naruto to see what Sasuke is going through since he had seen what to other 12 year olds were going through(Neji and Gaara) and acted accordingly, he just didn't want to because he wasn't really thinking about saving Sasuke,  at least not completely,  it was more about his worst fear coming true: the only person who understood him was leaving and he would be alone again. That's why I say he tried to manipulate Sasuke. In fact actually trying to understand Sasuke from the get go would have work because he listens when people see his perspective, Kakashi tells him to stop chasing Itachi and Sasuke considers letting go of his hatred after hearing that everyone Kakashi has ever cared about is dead. He only became Obito's errand boy and feel into his manipulation because he was told the truth of what led to the massacre of his clan he even joined Orochimaru specifically because the snake exploited his feelings of inferiority and his desire for revenge. \n\nAlso,  Sasuke knew exactly what Naruto was feeling, he understood but he didn't care because the whole point of leaving the village was to cut ties with everyone. In fact, this goes back to my point of Naruto being the one not to understand Sasuke,  he literally says Naruto has been alone his whole life so he'll never understand what it's like to have people taken from him, which is correct because Naruto doesn't know what love is and therefore cannot understand Sasuke's need for revenge. \n\nSo with all this in mind,  I'm not incorrect and I'm not undermining Naruto's character at all",

Plus that same 12 year old managed to get a 13 year old to rethink his entire life and finally let go of his hostility towards the family members he believed caused his father's death. This 12 year old also got another kid to stop being a psychopath who only finds meaning in life through killing others and actually let go of his past trauma and build relationships he never had before. If Naruto was emotionally mature enough to do all that, he could take second to see why this wasn't something that Sasuke could just get over, but he actively chose not to. And at no point did anyone consider killing Sasuke it was all about not letting Orochimaru get an Uchiha, at least for Konoha anyways, so it still wasn't about Sasuke's protection but rather about not letting the village's greatest enemy have something that could make him more powerful",

Like gaara, madara and gai are probally the best dubs in the series. And for different reasons. Gaaras dub comes off as emotional in shipuden, and every word he says has meaning and you can feel it. You can feel the fear, sadness or anger in his voice at any given time. Madaras dub is just fucking powerful. I actually watched a side by side of his dub and sub, and I prefer the dub because it comes off as boomier if that makes sense. He just sounds like an actual world ending threat.

You may be mature enough to see the bullshit in Sakura's story but you don't understand how easily children are influenced. \n\nAs for Naruto, he doesn't chase that said thug out of superficial love in hope that he'll turn good, he actively tries to bring that person in the right path.

In Shippuden, we see Naruto realize Sakura is simply not for him when he rejects her outright, right after the arc where he finally realized Hinata liked him. Yeah, it took a few more years to develop that into a relationship, but it\u2019s not like Naruto wasn\u2019t a little busy for most of that time to be thinking about a romantic relationship at that point.",

That's... super fucked up. \n\nAnd of course she treated him like trash. Remember at the beginning of the series in the academy where Naruto didn't have any friends? You have to look at the story from Sakura's perspective. Naruto was that kid in every class who doesn't pay attention, always interrupts, has no respect for authority, was failing his classes, and was getting in trouble with everyone up to the hokage. He was basically that kid everyone expects will end up in jail one day.\n\nHer whole life prior to team 7 was characterized by everyone avoiding Naruto, and the adults explained to her that his behavior was because he was an orphan. Why should she have treated him like a king? Why should she have been in love with him, for no reason? He was already a delinquent who all the adults hated, who was hitting on her despite her clearly not liking him. Why should a 12 year old be so mature to be able to see past the lies people told about Naruto so quickly? Once she learned about Naruto and the 9 tails, she got nicer. But prior to that, Naruto was literally a failure in her eyes. We only care about him and his crush for Sakura because we love underdogs and the show made sure we knew how depressed and pitiful Naruto was. Sakura didn't have any of that knowledge. He was that kid nobody liked, who wasn't amounting to anything, who liked her and therefore was bringing her already shitty image down as well. And then he got friendzoned. \n\nI wouldn't be super crazy over Naruto as well. \n\nAlso Sakura isn't comparing her life to Naruto's. They have a healthy adult friendship. I hate to imagine living your life jealous of your friends accomplishments or having someone jealous of yohrs. That's not something to be proud of.",

It makes no sense for Sakura to want to hang out with someone who is literally the bottom of the barrel in terms of academics and social standing, just because that kid liked her. She knew nothing about him. Naruto's love for her was the same as hers for Sasuke at the time. Shallow, and likewise it wouldve made no sense for Sasuke to want to hang out with Sakura, just because she liked him. \n\nKids are allowed to like who they want. Sakura was mean to Naruto, which was hard to watch at times, but it makes sense given that Naruto had no visibly redeeming qualities. He just shouted random shit about wanting to be hokage with nothing to prove for it. By the time Naruto got around to saving Sakura in the Zabuza fight, aka her first real time seeing Naruto being able to do something if I remember correctly, her relationship with Naruto had already solidified into what it is: slightly verbally abusive, but honestly pretty realistic for a bossy high school aged girl. \n\nShe slowly grew as a character. She became less harsh as she learned to see more of the world than just what was in front of her. And she and Naruto became friends.",

And he never told her. \n\nHe basically convinced her that she had a chance with Sasuke. She was a lonely girl who wanted to get with the popular guy, and Naruto solidified the idea in her head that she could be Sasuke's. \n\nSakura is beloved by fans because she embodies the fantasy of a young girls: the idea that a normal girl has a chance to stand amongst the cool kids, or rather the members of team 7. Sakura's attempts at being as good of a ninja as her teammates never really went far, but the fact that she tried anyway and that her teammates still values her despite her flaws, meant a lot to younger girls reading Naruto. She's not unique in that she's a member of team 7, she's unique in that she never got overpowered, and therefore she remained somewhat relatable to female readers throughout the entire series.",

Naruto only connected with Gaara in OG Naruto cause their experiences were pretty similar and they were both just seen as weapons by their respective nations . He didnt empathize with Zabuza,Orochimaru,Kimimaro and Kabuto in OG at all . Same goes for all other villains he fought in Shippuden till he fought Pain . He also wanted to kill Pain but Pain changed him completely as a person (Minato too because of what he said to him when he stopped his Nine Tails Transformation) . And after fighting Pain , Naruto instantly started understanding Sasuke a lot better and tried to save him the correct way . You cant expect a 12 year old kid to understand how much anothet 12 year kid has gone through. Sasuke also never understood how much pain Naruto was going through while leaving the village . So your reasoning here is completely incorrect and is undermining Naruto's character a lot imo .",

                    "body": "OK, maybe I worded my statement wrong, my point is that Naruto will always try to appeal to those who act as his foil, people who are a different side of him he thankfully rejected before it consumed him, he does this to those special people he feels a kinship with despite the fact that they're trying to kill him. Obito and Gaara were the mass murderers I was referring so technically I'm still right. He wouldn't do this with Kimimaro because he was focused on Sasuke and Kimimaro has no qualities that reflect Naruto in any way, he doesn't Kabuto because Kabuto took his job so seriously as a spy he's essentially a blank page, he's only with Orochimaru because he's so manipulative, on the topic of Orochimaru,  he's the evil who he's tryingto save Sasuke from, so of course he wouldn't stop to think ask Orochimaruwhy he's doing everything he has. The whole Zabuza mission, narratively speaking, was to show Naruto the reality of being a shinobi, the types of people he'd come across on his journey and I personally think it's seeing Haku, a person who seemed nice in Naruto's perspective, be such a villain that he was supposed to understand its going to be a long road for him and I think it was seeing how much Zabuza cared for him that showed Naruto that his enemies are people as well.\n\nOn to Shippuden,  most of Naruto's enemies were just a part of his personal growth, they themselves were not meant to hold Naruto's attention in the same way Gaara and Neji had. Deidara and Sasori aren't Naruto's villain,  they the villains of the arc, but Naruto's main enemy was his failure to save Gaara, it was supposed to remind him that just because he has a bit more ability as a ninja he still has long way to go to actually improve and save Sasuke. We see just how much he has to grow after Sasuke makes short work of him. Hidan was for Shikamaru's personal growth he needed to step up and be a leader and get over his fear of his comrades dying after the Sasuke retrieval failure so Naruto has nothing to do with that. Kakuzy was just to show that Naruto had bridged the gap between him and Sasuke at least in terms of power so he could have a chance to get through to him. I agree with you on your point about Pain so I have nothing to say on that.\n\nTo counter your points about Sasuke, first of all I can expect Naruto to see what Sasuke is going through since he had seen what to other 12 year olds were going through(Neji and Gaara) and acted accordingly, he just didn't want to because he wasn't really thinking about saving Sasuke,  at least not completely,  it was more about his worst fear coming true: the only person who understood him was leaving and he would be alone again. That's why I say he tried to manipulate Sasuke. In fact actually trying to understand Sasuke from the get go would have work because he listens when people see his perspective, Kakashi tells him to stop chasing Itachi and Sasuke considers letting go of his hatred after hearing that everyone Kakashi has ever cared about is dead. He only became Obito's errand boy and feel into his manipulation because he was told the truth of what led to the massacre of his clan he even joined Orochimaru specifically because the snake exploited his feelings of inferiority and his desire for revenge. \n\nAlso,  Sasuke knew exactly what Naruto was feeling, he understood but he didn't care because the whole point of leaving the village was to cut ties with everyone. In fact, this goes back to my point of Naruto being the one not to understand Sasuke,  he literally says Naruto has been alone his whole life so he'll never understand what it's like to have people taken from him, which is correct because Naruto doesn't know what love is and therefore cannot understand Sasuke's need for revenge. \n\nSo with all this in mind,  I'm not incorrect and I'm not undermining Naruto's character at all",

This 12 year old also got another kid to stop being a psychopath who only finds meaning in life through killing others and actually let go of his past trauma and build relationships he never had before. If Naruto was emotionally mature enough to do all that, he could take second to see why this wasn't something that Sasuke could just get over, but he actively chose not to. And at no point did anyone consider killing Sasuke it was all about not letting Orochimaru get an Uchiha, at least for Konoha anyways, so it still wasn't about Sasuke's protection but rather about not letting the village's greatest enemy have something that could make him more powerful",

You should just watch the final valley battle in sub and see his voice acting in the \"over and over and over..\" scene . I have heard Gaara's dub voice and its pretty good .

You may be mature enough to see the bullshit in Sakura's story but you don't understand how easily children are influenced. \n\nAs for Naruto, he doesn't chase that said thug out of superficial love in hope that he'll turn good, he actively tries to bring that person in the right path. Now that's a way better moral of the story: \"if you have a friend going to the darkness, bring them to the light\".

It makes no sense for Sakura to want to hang out with someone who is literally the bottom of the barrel in terms of academics and social standing, just because that kid liked her. She knew nothing about him. Naruto's love for her was the same as hers for Sasuke at the time. Shallow, and likewise it wouldve made no sense for Sasuke to want to hang out with Sakura, just because she liked him. \n\nKids are allowed to like who they want. Sakura was mean to Naruto, which was hard to watch at times, but it makes sense given that Naruto had no visibly redeeming qualities. He just shouted random shit about wanting to be hokage with nothing to prove for it. By the time Naruto got around to saving Sakura in the Zabuza fight, aka her first real time seeing Naruto being able to do something if I remember correctly, her relationship with Naruto had already solidified into what it is: slightly verbally abusive, but honestly pretty realistic for a bossy high school aged girl. \n\nShe slowly grew as a character. She became less harsh as she learned to see more of the world than just what was in front of her. And she and Naruto became friends.",

            "body": "OK, maybe I worded my statement wrong, my point is that Naruto will always try to appeal to those who act as his foil, people who are a different side of him he thankfully rejected before it consumed him, he does this to those special people he feels a kinship with despite the fact that they're trying to kill him. Obito and Gaara were the mass murderers I was referring so technically I'm still right. He wouldn't do this with Kimimaro because he was focused on Sasuke and Kimimaro has no qualities that reflect Naruto in any way, he doesn't Kabuto because Kabuto took his job so seriously as a spy he's essentially a blank page, he's only with Orochimaru because he's so manipulative, on the topic of Orochimaru,  he's the evil who he's tryingto save Sasuke from, so of course he wouldn't stop to think ask Orochimaruwhy he's doing everything he has. The whole Zabuza mission, narratively speaking, was to show Naruto the reality of being a shinobi, the types of people he'd come across on his journey and I personally think it's seeing Haku, a person who seemed nice in Naruto's perspective, be such a villain that he was supposed to understand its going to be a long road for him and I think it was seeing how much Zabuza cared for him that showed Naruto that his enemies are people as well.\n\nOn to Shippuden,  most of Naruto's enemies were just a part of his personal growth, they themselves were not meant to hold Naruto's attention in the same way Gaara and Neji had. Deidara and Sasori aren't Naruto's villain,  they the villains of the arc, but Naruto's main enemy was his failure to save Gaara, it was supposed to remind him that just because he has a bit more ability as a ninja he still has long way to go to actually improve and save Sasuke. We see just how much he has to grow after Sasuke makes short work of him. Hidan was for Shikamaru's personal growth he needed to step up and be a leader and get over his fear of his comrades dying after the Sasuke retrieval failure so Naruto has nothing to do with that. Kakuzy was just to show that Naruto had bridged the gap between him and Sasuke at least in terms of power so he could have a chance to get through to him. I agree with you on your point about Pain so I have nothing to say on that.\n\nTo counter your points about Sasuke, first of all I can expect Naruto to see what Sasuke is going through since he had seen what to other 12 year olds were going through(Neji and Gaara) and acted accordingly, he just didn't want to because he wasn't really thinking about saving Sasuke,  at least not completely,  it was more about his worst fear coming true: the only person who understood him was leaving and he would be alone again. That's why I say he tried to manipulate Sasuke. In fact actually trying to understand Sasuke from the get go would have work because he listens when people see his perspective, Kakashi tells him to stop chasing Itachi and Sasuke considers letting go of his hatred after hearing that everyone Kakashi has ever cared about is dead. He only became Obito's errand boy and feel into his manipulation because he was told the truth of what led to the massacre of his clan he even joined Orochimaru specifically because the snake exploited his feelings of inferiority and his desire for revenge. \n\nAlso,  Sasuke knew exactly what Naruto was feeling, he understood but he didn't care because the whole point of leaving the village was to cut ties with everyone. In fact, this goes back to my point of Naruto being the one not to understand Sasuke,  he literally says Naruto has been alone his whole life so he'll never understand what it's like to have people taken from him, which is correct because Naruto doesn't know what love is and therefore cannot understand Sasuke's need for revenge. \n\nSo with all this in mind,  I'm not incorrect and I'm not undermining Naruto's character at all",

This 12 year old also got another kid to stop being a psychopath who only finds meaning in life through killing others and actually let go of his past trauma and build relationships he never had before. If Naruto was emotionally mature enough to do all that, he could take second to see why this wasn't something that Sasuke could just get over, but he actively chose not to. And at no point did anyone consider killing Sasuke it was all about not letting Orochimaru get an Uchiha, at least for Konoha anyways, so it still wasn't about Sasuke's protection but rather about not letting the village's greatest enemy have something that could make him more powerful",

For instance if you tell a little girl that they're capable of dating the cool guy of the school by stalking him enough, that it's totally worth stalking the jerk who treats you like shit your entire life because \"he'll turn good\", that it's totally normal for him to leave you as a single mom. You may be mature enough to see the bullshit in Sakura's story but you don't understand how easily children are influenced. \n\nAs for Naruto, he doesn't chase that said thug out of superficial love in hope that he'll turn good, he actively tries to bring that person in the right path. Now that's a way better moral of the story: \"if you have a friend going to the darkness, bring them to the light\". Little boys are influenced by this as well because they might identity themselves in the main male character.",

This 12 year old also got another kid to stop being a psychopath who only finds meaning in life through killing others and actually let go of his past trauma and build relationships he never had before. If Naruto was emotionally mature enough to do all that, he could take second to see why this wasn't something that Sasuke could just get over, but he actively chose not to. And at no point did anyone consider killing Sasuke it was all about not letting Orochimaru get an Uchiha, at least for Konoha anyways, so it still wasn't about Sasuke's protection but rather about not letting the village's greatest enemy have something that could make him more powerful",

This 12 year old also got another kid to stop being a psychopath who only finds meaning in life through killing others and actually let go of his past trauma and build relationships he never had before. If Naruto was emotionally mature enough to do all that, he could take second to see why this wasn't something that Sasuke could just get over, but he actively chose not to. And at no point did anyone consider killing Sasuke it was all about not letting Orochimaru get an Uchiha, at least for Konoha anyways, so it still wasn't about Sasuke's protection but rather about not letting the village's greatest enemy have something that could make him more powerful",

He wouldn't have left if it wasn't for the Sound Four or Itachi putting him under tsukuyomi. Naruto spent one month training to bring Tsunade so she could heal Sasuke. \n\nBut the issue is Kishimoto's editors rushed him into the Chunin Exams when he wanted to do another arc like the Waves before. \n\nAlso, I personally did not see a \"deep connection\" between Orochimaru and Jiraiya but you're entitled to your own opinion.",
