    "body": "I'm in a country where what I can afford is considered real sugar and not Splenda. I recently found an SB whom I really hit it off with. \n\nMy SB had an old phone (3+ years old) with a cracked screen, so I decided to buy her a new one and took her shopping. I guided her toward models that were in my budget ($400), and she didn't push me for anything more expensive. It was fun to watch her play with the different phones, and we took some cute selfies. I was delighted to pay for it, and it gave me such joy to watch her use her new phone. The other day, she told me a cashier commented on her phone (which was released recently) and asked to see it. I liked that she was envied. \n\nLast week, I bought her a plane ticket so she could take a modeling gig in another city. She asked for it very respectfully (not in an entitled way), and it makes me happy that I'm helping her support herself. She's been very appreciative and sent me a picture from the plane.\n\nThe other day I gave her cash for a taxi to go see her uncle in a nearby town, and the cab ended up being less money than I gave her. She sent me a picture of her uncle holding a birthday cake and said she used the extra money to buy the cake for her uncle. (She turned my \"sugar\" into real sugar.) I felt that really demonstrated her thoughtfulness: she used the extra money on something nice for someone else. \n\nOur arrangement will probably end up with a cash allowance, but she hasn't pushed for one.\n\nThe benefits I'm getting are nice, but I'm enjoying the giving part and it doesn't feel transactional. I can't speak for other SDs, but I really like it when an SB shows appreciation. This is probably basic human instinct (and an important part of the father/daughter relationship), but sometimes a little \"thank you\" can go a long way.",

What we agreed to was Splenda-level ($200) so I understand where she was coming from, but *she agreed to it*. Her request for more after we had agreed and before intimacy detracted from the experience. And it was annoying because I had actually given her $300, but it turned out she hadn't counted it yet.  \n\nIn case you were wondering, the $200 wasn't the only part of the deal - I also got her third-row tickets to a concert of one of her favorite bands.",

She was actually engaged to her former SD, but she says she didn't marry him because he wanted her to come back to his country with him and she wanted to stay in her country. I'm sure there's more to the story, but I don't have any reason to believe her part isn't true. \n\nMaybe she's a rinser playing the long game (which is common in the country I'm in) or... maybe she actually likes me. As I said, we share a rare fetish and it's something she's never opened up about or experienced with someone before. \n\nWe only just started a few weeks ago. Depending on how business goes, I may be able to give her more, and she may end up negotiating for more. But a fair allowance is what someone is willing to accept. $500 is more enough to rent a one-bedroom apartment in a nearby neighborhood (she happens to share one with someone else in my neighborhood). So I guess the equivalent would be $2,000 in New York. \n\nTo put things in perspective, my rent is $1,100 for a 47sqm / 500sqft one-bedroom apartment in a building with security, a gym, pool, and laundry/dry cleaning delivery. Also included is 75Mbps fiber Internet access and electricity. And what I'm paying is on the high side because I'm on a three-month lease. There are cities where you can get that for $900/month or less. \n\nWhen I lived in Manhattan, I was paying $3,500 a month plus utilities for an apartment slightly larger (60sqm/650sqft) with basically the same amenities.

I'm sure there's more to the story, but I don't have any reason to believe her part isn't true. \n\nMaybe she's a rinser playing the long game (which is common in the country I'm in) or... maybe she actually likes me. As I said, we share a rare fetish and it's something she's never opened up about or experienced with someone before. \n\nWe only just started a few weeks ago. Depending on how business goes, I may be able to give her more, and she may end up negotiating for more. But a fair allowance is what someone is willing to accept. $500 is more enough to rent a one-bedroom apartment in a nearby neighborhood (she happens to share one with someone else in my neighborhood). So I guess the equivalent would be $2,000 in New York. \n\nTo put things in perspective, my rent is $1,100 for a 47sqm / 500sqft one-bedroom apartment in a building with security, a gym, pool, and laundry/dry cleaning delivery. Also included is 75Mbps fiber Internet access and electricity. And what I'm paying is on the high side because I'm on a three-month lease. There are cities where you can get that for $900/month or less. \n\nWhen I lived in Manhattan, I was paying $3,500 a month plus utilities for an apartment slightly larger (60sqm/650sqft) with basically the same amenities.

She was actually engaged to her former SD, but she says she didn't marry him because he wanted her to come back to his country with him and she wanted to stay in her country. I'm sure there's more to the story, but I don't have any reason to believe her part isn't true. \n\nMaybe she's a rinser playing the long game (which is common in the country I'm in) or... maybe she actually likes me. As I said, we share a rare fetish and it's something she's never opened up about or experienced with someone before. \n\nWe only just started a few weeks ago. Depending on how business goes, I may be able to give her more, and she may end up negotiating for more. But a fair allowance is what someone is willing to accept. $500 is more enough to rent a one-bedroom apartment in a nearby neighborhood (she happens to share one with someone else in my neighborhood). So I guess the equivalent would be $2,000 in New York. \n\nTo put things in perspective, my rent is $1,100 for a 47sqm / 500sqft one-bedroom apartment in a building with security, a gym, pool, and laundry/dry cleaning delivery. Also included is 75Mbps fiber Internet access and electricity. And what I'm paying is on the high side because I'm on a three-month lease. There are cities where you can get that for $900/month or less. \n\nWhen I lived in Manhattan, I was paying $3,500 a month plus utilities for an apartment slightly larger (60sqm/650sqft) with basically the same amenities.

            "body": "She's an experienced SB. She was actually engaged to her former SD, but she says she didn't marry him because he wanted her to come back to his country with him and she wanted to stay in her country. I'm sure there's more to the story, but I don't have any reason to believe her part isn't true. \n\nMaybe she's a rinser playing the long game (which is common in the country I'm in) or... maybe she actually likes me. As I said, we share a rare fetish and it's something she's never opened up about or experienced with someone before. \n\nWe only just started a few weeks ago. Depending on how business goes, I may be able to give her more, and she may end up negotiating for more. But a fair allowance is what someone is willing to accept. $500 is more enough to rent a one-bedroom apartment in a nearby neighborhood (she happens to share one with someone else in my neighborhood). So I guess the equivalent would be $2,000 in New York. \n\nTo put things in perspective, my rent is $1,100 for a 47sqm / 500sqft one-bedroom apartment in a building with security, a gym, pool, and laundry/dry cleaning delivery. Also included is 75Mbps fiber Internet access and electricity. And what I'm paying is on the high side because I'm on a three-month lease. There are cities where you can get that for $900/month or less. \n\nWhen I lived in Manhattan, I was paying $3,500 a month plus utilities for an apartment slightly larger (60sqm/650sqft) with basically the same amenities.
