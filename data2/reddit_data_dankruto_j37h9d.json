Also this is just an assumption but I don\u2019t think Mito had the creation rebirth technique because when Tsunade was telling Madara about her hundred healings jutsu, Madara said he\u2019d never heard of it. However remember when Kabuto told Madara Naruto\u2019s name, Madara acknowledged that Naruto was from Mito Uzumaki\u2019s clan, and he flashbacks to the image of her (with the diamond seal on her forehead) so he did know what it looked like. And I highly doubt that he wouldn\u2019t have made the connection if the seal was primarily for the hundred healings technique. Tsunade most likely invented the regeneration technique, not the actual seal itself. Mito probably created the seal, as the Uzumaki clan were renowned for their sealing abilities as it was their specialty. I believe Mito was simply storing chakra in her forehead, but I don\u2019t think that the mitotic regeneration jutsu was of her creation.",

This is a different thing compared to the actual seal. If you read Boruto chapter 36 page 17 it says that the _seal_ is from the sage of six paths era. It was around even before Tsunade was born. However the seal can also be combined with Tsunade\u2019s mitotic regeneration. The healing jutsu is what Tsunade most likely invented, not the seal. \n\n\nAlso you\u2019re making stuff up, Tsunade never claims in the manga that she created the seal.",

Also this is just an assumption but I don\u2019t think Mito had the creation rebirth technique because when Tsunade was telling Madara about her hundred healings jutsu, Madara said he\u2019d never heard of it. However remember when Kabuto told Madara Naruto\u2019s name, Madara acknowledged that Naruto was from Mito Uzumaki\u2019s clan, and he flashbacks to the image of her (with the diamond seal on her forehead) so he did know what it looked like. And I highly doubt that he wouldn\u2019t have made the connection if the seal was primarily for the hundred healings technique. Tsunade most likely invented the regeneration technique, not the actual seal itself. Mito probably created the seal, as the Uzumaki clan were renowned for their sealing abilities as it was their specialty. I believe Mito was simply storing chakra in her forehead, but I don\u2019t think that the mitotic regeneration jutsu was of her creation.",

Also this is just an assumption but I don\u2019t think Mito had the creation rebirth technique because when Tsunade was telling Madara about her hundred healings jutsu, Madara said he\u2019d never heard of it. However remember when Kabuto told Madara Naruto\u2019s name, Madara acknowledged that Naruto was from Mito Uzumaki\u2019s clan, and he flashbacks to the image of her (with the diamond seal on her forehead) so he did know what it looked like. And I highly doubt that he wouldn\u2019t have made the connection if the seal was primarily for the hundred healings technique. Tsunade most likely invented the regeneration technique, not the actual seal itself. Mito probably created the seal, as the Uzumaki clan were renowned for their sealing abilities as it was their specialty. I believe Mito was simply storing chakra in her forehead, but I don\u2019t think that the mitotic regeneration jutsu was of her creation.",

However the seal can also be combined with Tsunade\u2019s mitotic regeneration. The healing jutsu is what Tsunade most likely invented, not the seal. \n\n\nAlso you\u2019re making stuff up, Tsunade never claims in the manga that she created the seal.",

Also this is just an assumption but I don\u2019t think Mito had the creation rebirth technique because when Tsunade was telling Madara about her hundred healings jutsu, Madara said he\u2019d never heard of it. However remember when Kabuto told Madara Naruto\u2019s name, Madara acknowledged that Naruto was from Mito Uzumaki\u2019s clan, and he flashbacks to the image of her (with the diamond seal on her forehead) so he did know what it looked like. And I highly doubt that he wouldn\u2019t have made the connection if the seal was primarily for the hundred healings technique. Tsunade most likely invented the regeneration technique, not the actual seal itself. Mito probably created the seal, as the Uzumaki clan were renowned for their sealing abilities as it was their specialty. I believe Mito was simply storing chakra in her forehead, but I don\u2019t think that the mitotic regeneration jutsu was of her creation.",

This is a different thing compared to the actual seal. If you read Boruto chapter 36 page 17 it says that the _seal_ is from the sage of six paths era. It was around even before Tsunade was born. However the seal can also be combined with Tsunade\u2019s mitotic regeneration. The healing jutsu is what Tsunade most likely invented, not the seal. \n\n\nAlso you\u2019re making stuff up, Tsunade never claims in the manga that she created the seal.",

The healing jutsu is what Tsunade most likely invented, not the seal. \n\n\nAlso you\u2019re making stuff up, Tsunade never claims in the manga that she created the seal.",

However the seal can also be combined with Tsunade\u2019s mitotic regeneration. The healing jutsu is what Tsunade most likely invented, not the seal. \n\n\nAlso you\u2019re making stuff up, Tsunade never claims in the manga that she created the seal.",

If you read Boruto chapter 36 page 17 it says that the _seal_ is from the sage of six paths era. It was around even before Tsunade was born. However the seal can also be combined with Tsunade\u2019s mitotic regeneration. The healing jutsu is what Tsunade most likely invented, not the seal. \n\n\nAlso you\u2019re making stuff up, Tsunade never claims in the manga that she created the seal.",

If you read Boruto chapter 36 page 17 it says that the _seal_ is from the sage of six paths era. It was around even before Tsunade was born. However the seal can also be combined with Tsunade\u2019s mitotic regeneration. The healing jutsu is what Tsunade most likely invented, not the seal. \n\n\nAlso you\u2019re making stuff up, Tsunade never claims in the manga that she created the seal.",

However the seal can also be combined with Tsunade\u2019s mitotic regeneration. The healing jutsu is what Tsunade most likely invented, not the seal. \n\n\nAlso you\u2019re making stuff up, Tsunade never claims in the manga that she created the seal.",

If you read Boruto chapter 36 page 17 it says that the _seal_ is from the sage of six paths era. It was around even before Tsunade was born. However the seal can also be combined with Tsunade\u2019s mitotic regeneration. The healing jutsu is what Tsunade most likely invented, not the seal. \n\n\nAlso you\u2019re making stuff up, Tsunade never claims in the manga that she created the seal.",

If you read Boruto chapter 36 page 17 it says that the _seal_ is from the sage of six paths era. It was around even before Tsunade was born. However the seal can also be combined with Tsunade\u2019s mitotic regeneration. The healing jutsu is what Tsunade most likely invented, not the seal. \n\n\nAlso you\u2019re making stuff up, Tsunade never claims in the manga that she created the seal.",
