    "body": "YIFU. Guys, never in my life have I been as happy as I am right now with the SBs I am seeing.  So the fact that I agreed to see an old fling last night makes this especially dumb.  I try not to think with my penis 100% of the time, but the little guy is just so *damn* persuasive.\n#\nThese two girls I met back in January, and saw a few times called me up.  \"Leah\" and \"Ally\" wanted one last fling, so I set something up. \n#\nThey showed up early, and we had one drink in my hotel room.  Well, Ally was on something, because after one drink she could not walk. We tried to make it to the restaurant, turned around, and let Ally sleep on the couch in the hotel room.\n#\nLeah was mad at her friend, but we had a nice date and came back to the hotel room. Ally was still sleeping, so Leah and I had a good time in the bedroom. I pull out, yank the condom off, stand up on the mattress, and just as my dick goes into Leah's mouth, Ally walks in...\n#\nLadies, there is no \"pause\" button. My dick ain't netflix yo.  But Ally looks at Leah and says:  \"I love you. I have always loved you...\"  She goes off on like five straight minutes of some Shakespeare level stuff to her girlfriend, while my ass is just trying to finish.  I'm a 42 year old bald and snipped man. On some days, I'm just happy for two little squirts, you know? But of course THIS is the night my body is looking to open up a bakery that serves nothing but creampies.  I'm mentally telling my dick to stop, when Ally **proposes** to her girlfriend.  One knee and everything.\n#\nLeah chokes down what she can and rushes over to Ally, very excited. When Leah jumps off the mattress, I go sailing backwards.  My dudes, french fry shaped men dont got no equilibrium.  As I am flying through the air like Wile E. Coyote, **still cumming,** I can see Leah and Ally kissing, which kind of offends me.  Its not like I am stingy with who gets my semen, but also, Ally didnt earn a taste, you know?\n#\nSo Leah and Ally are downtown at a courthouse now, getting hitched.  Glad I could help?",
