Use a bit of matte pomade or paste and style it like you've got it here. If your committed to growing it out. Resist the urge to trim all the time, it'll easily double the time to get to shoulder length. You look fine. With hair like yours, shoulder length will also look great.",

Also keep a rotation of about 3 towels so that way they can fully dry out between uses.",
