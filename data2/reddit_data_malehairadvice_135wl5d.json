    "body": "Had a good looking mullet but I kinda wanted to get it shortned. I went to a barber which is in my college\u2019s campus, although my friends told me he was bad at his job didn\u2019t really care for as what I wanted was quite easy to do. Don\u2019t know what to do know and I have a first date this week. So any advice to fix this monstrosity will be taken.",

I\u2019d wear it that way until the top grows out again. good luck bro",

Seriously. \nDid someone actually put a bowl over your head and cut around it? \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude02\nJust messing with you. \n\nActually it looks again not so bad at all.\nAnd a personal preference of mine is the earrings work on you, and not for everyone, that's for sure.\n\nI would offer the suggestion to lose the mustache because it's more of a crustache / which is sort of a slang term for a non-full mustache. I had the same around your age and once I shaved the crustache, for whatever reason I could grow a full mustache.\nI don't know if that's common or not.\n\nSo yeah to sum it up I think you should let it grow back out and do what I've been doing which is called a business mullet.\n\nYou can look it up, and it's just more of a subtle mullet that's not as goofy like Billy Ray Cyrus perhaps still does, which I always thought looked ridiculous, however he pulled it off. I'm not sure if he still has the mullet, and I really hope he doesn't lol\n\nOh incidentally, the name of the salon where I get haircuts now for several years, is ironically called \"Pink Mullet\" \nI kid you not \n\nTake care my man, and as folks have already mentioned, it'll grow out in a couple of months, perhaps a little longer so you can do the mullet again. \nMeantime you look fine with a solid bowl cut! \ud83e\udd1c\ud83e\udd1b",
