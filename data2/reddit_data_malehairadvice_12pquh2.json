I keep mine trimmed above the top of my lip line at all times in terms of height, and just past the corners of my mouth in terms of length of the stache. Stubble fits you well too if you prefer that.",

Great for formal suit and tie, clean sharp looks.\n\nMoustache/quirky facial hair will look silly but not unattractive silly so if you want a more disarming/playful look it's a great option. Bright colours and creative/themed wardrobe will work well with this. Also probably hats.\n\nFull or **Full** bear will soften your jawline a bit. You've got that chiseled angles thing going without a beard so if you want to soften your look a big ol beard will do it. Soften also doesn't mean less masculine funnily enough. You get to go for comfy protective woodsman looks and manly explorer vibes with a big ol beard. If you like puffy vests and flannies I'd go the big beard. Clean shaven and angular faced those outfits will look a bit suburban psychopath on you, but with a beard you'll immediately look like a cover model woodsman.",
