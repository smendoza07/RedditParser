If you see anything you like, save it to your phone, then bring those pics to a barber or stylist you trust. Show them the picture and ask for that cut.\n\nAlso look into proper hair care for your kind of hair. You might be using shampoo too often, for example, which can strip natural oils and make shit look crazy.",

If you have that, you can just google that style, and you'll probably find more examples. You might even find slight style variations! \n\nPoint is, if you can roll up to a barber armed with the style you want and several pictures to match, you'll have a much better outcome. Way better than trying to describe it. \n\nYou can ask them for beard advice too, while you're at it. You could probably trim it up a bit and it would look good.",
