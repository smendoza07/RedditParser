JSJ has taken over from Kwang Soo as the show\u2019s whipping boy so that character is gone as well. Sechan is one of KJK\u2019s henchmen but haha plays that role better so he doesn\u2019t stand out much there. I feel like the somin/sechan love line helped him out and was quite entertaining but aside from that I still feel he doesn\u2019t have a strong character on the show yet.",

He tried playing the little brother role but it mostly was annoying. I feel bad for him tbh for not having a strong place. Like in episode 570, where they googled their names and he lost to JSJ... And it turned out JSJ would lose to even bottled water... Not that popularity like this matters, but if he were to leave the show or be replaced not much will change or happen. \n\nI guess time helped him tho. The other dudes are now officially old(er), so ysc now has an advantage in some games. I know the RM dudes can still probably outrun young men, but the advantage is still available for the younger. He even won against KJK in a running match.\n\nEdit: typos",

She was just so naturally entertaining and that\u2019s not even her day job! She has her acting career as her main occupation, so she has different income to fall back on. Being funny isn\u2019t even her job (but she\u2019s so good at it), but Sechan has nothing except being funny as a full-time job! I really felt bad for him when in that chatting episode he said there hasn\u2019t been a single day he came to work for RM that he wasn\u2019t anxious the night before. He vibes like he HAS to be funny or it\u2019s all over for him. He doesn\u2019t have another main occupation - income-wise, this is it for him. \n\nThe thing I enjoy most about his character is his goofy antics (the noises he makes when pretending to be in pain), his banter his Somin, and his occassional super sharp moments during games when he realizes the bigger picture",

He's doing quite well in his main job. So I don't see the need to feel bad for him. SM's acting success in the past two years after her hiatus shouldn't make people forget that even when she was struggling getting acting gigs, Se Chan was steadily working. He is doing quite well in his main job considering all the competition among male entertainers. The CF that JH and SM are doing together was also done previously by SC and SH. SC won the top excellence award last year. Their journeys are different. You can be happy for SM's success without negatively comparing him to SC when he is in fact doing quite well as a comedian and entertainer. I bet his earnings are quite good too.",

I ofc might be biased cause my favorites were guests but not just them. Idk, the guests just did some hilarious things and the cast worked so well with them. \n\nMost guests today are not like those, but RM needs guests. So I find myself wanting RM without guests because most are boring nowadays, but also knowing guests can and will make it interesting... Just not very young idols who can only do their one choreography over and over and nobody is allowed to make fun of them. \n\nBut I started watching this show because of jsm. I even skipped the few episodes she was absent either during Covid or her hospitalization. So it's very hard to go back to when she wasn't there. As much as I like the rest of the cast, I don't care enough to watch their other appearances. I've watched anything and everything jsm has touched. Lol \n\nMany stopped watching without LKS. It doesn't make us solo stans but we all have our faves without whom the show feels empty.",

JSJ has taken over from Kwang Soo as the show\u2019s whipping boy so that character is gone as well. Sechan is one of KJK\u2019s henchmen but haha plays that role better so he doesn\u2019t stand out much there. I feel like the somin/sechan love line helped him out and was quite entertaining but aside from that I still feel he doesn\u2019t have a strong character on the show yet.",

He tried playing the little brother role but it mostly was annoying. I feel bad for him tbh for not having a strong place. Like in episode 570, where they googled their names and he lost to JSJ... And it turned out JSJ would lose to even bottled water... Not that popularity like this matters, but if he were to leave the show or be replaced not much will change or happen. \n\nI guess time helped him tho. The other dudes are now officially old(er), so ysc now has an advantage in some games. I know the RM dudes can still probably outrun young men, but the advantage is still available for the younger. He even won against KJK in a running match.\n\nEdit: typos",

Being funny isn\u2019t even her job (but she\u2019s so good at it), but Sechan has nothing except being funny as a full-time job! I really felt bad for him when in that chatting episode he said there hasn\u2019t been a single day he came to work for RM that he wasn\u2019t anxious the night before. He vibes like he HAS to be funny or it\u2019s all over for him. He doesn\u2019t have another main occupation - income-wise, this is it for him. \n\nThe thing I enjoy most about his character is his goofy antics (the noises he makes when pretending to be in pain), his banter his Somin, and his occassional super sharp moments during games when he realizes the bigger picture",

He's doing quite well in his main job. So I don't see the need to feel bad for him. SM's acting success in the past two years after her hiatus shouldn't make people forget that even when she was struggling getting acting gigs, Se Chan was steadily working. He is doing quite well in his main job considering all the competition among male entertainers. The CF that JH and SM are doing together was also done previously by SC and SH. SC won the top excellence award last year. Their journeys are different. You can be happy for SM's success without negatively comparing him to SC when he is in fact doing quite well as a comedian and entertainer. I bet his earnings are quite good too.",

I ofc might be biased cause my favorites were guests but not just them. Idk, the guests just did some hilarious things and the cast worked so well with them. \n\nMost guests today are not like those, but RM needs guests. So I find myself wanting RM without guests because most are boring nowadays, but also knowing guests can and will make it interesting... Just not very young idols who can only do their one choreography over and over and nobody is allowed to make fun of them. \n\nBut I started watching this show because of jsm. I even skipped the few episodes she was absent either during Covid or her hospitalization. So it's very hard to go back to when she wasn't there. As much as I like the rest of the cast, I don't care enough to watch their other appearances. I've watched anything and everything jsm has touched. Lol \n\nMany stopped watching without LKS.

He tried playing the little brother role but it mostly was annoying. I feel bad for him tbh for not having a strong place. Like in episode 570, where they googled their names and he lost to JSJ... And it turned out JSJ would lose to even bottled water... Not that popularity like this matters, but if he were to leave the show or be replaced not much will change or happen. \n\nI guess time helped him tho. The other dudes are now officially old(er), so ysc now has an advantage in some games. I know the RM dudes can still probably outrun young men, but the advantage is still available for the younger. He even won against KJK in a running match.\n\nEdit: typos",

Being funny isn\u2019t even her job (but she\u2019s so good at it), but Sechan has nothing except being funny as a full-time job! I really felt bad for him when in that chatting episode he said there hasn\u2019t been a single day he came to work for RM that he wasn\u2019t anxious the night before. He vibes like he HAS to be funny or it\u2019s all over for him. He doesn\u2019t have another main occupation - income-wise, this is it for him. \n\nThe thing I enjoy most about his character is his goofy antics (the noises he makes when pretending to be in pain), his banter his Somin, and his occassional super sharp moments during games when he realizes the bigger picture",

He's doing quite well in his main job. So I don't see the need to feel bad for him. SM's acting success in the past two years after her hiatus shouldn't make people forget that even when she was struggling getting acting gigs, Se Chan was steadily working. He is doing quite well in his main job considering all the competition among male entertainers. The CF that JH and SM are doing together was also done previously by SC and SH. SC won the top excellence award last year. Their journeys are different. You can be happy for SM's success without negatively comparing him to SC when he is in fact doing quite well as a comedian and entertainer. I bet his earnings are quite good too.",

The villainess episode was one of the most iconic episodes, but because of the guests. I think most of the episodes that I've seen were only good BECAUSE of the guests. I ofc might be biased cause my favorites were guests but not just them. Idk, the guests just did some hilarious things and the cast worked so well with them. \n\nMost guests today are not like those, but RM needs guests. So I find myself wanting RM without guests because most are boring nowadays, but also knowing guests can and will make it interesting... Just not very young idols who can only do their one choreography over and over and nobody is allowed to make fun of them. \n\nBut I started watching this show because of jsm. I even skipped the few episodes she was absent either during Covid or her hospitalization. So it's very hard to go back to when she wasn't there. As much as I like the rest of the cast, I don't care enough to watch their other appearances. I've watched anything and everything jsm has touched. Lol \n\nMany stopped watching without LKS. It doesn't make us solo stans but we all have our faves without whom the show feels empty.",

He's doing quite well in his main job. So I don't see the need to feel bad for him. SM's acting success in the past two years after her hiatus shouldn't make people forget that even when she was struggling getting acting gigs, Se Chan was steadily working. He is doing quite well in his main job considering all the competition among male entertainers. The CF that JH and SM are doing together was also done previously by SC and SH. SC won the top excellence award last year. Their journeys are different. You can be happy for SM's success without negatively comparing him to SC when he is in fact doing quite well as a comedian and entertainer. I bet his earnings are quite good too.",
