In the morning, your face is a little puffy, put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. (1000 is recommended). After You remove the ice pack, use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower, use a water activated gel cleanser. Then a honey almond body scrub. And on the face, an exfoliating gel scrub. Then apply an herb mint facial mask, leave on for 10 minutes while You prepare the rest of your routine. always use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.",
