Because hell, I might one day be a victim of this whole police brutality. \n\nI am just saying that this should instead be recognised as an abuse of power problem as a whole and not JUST a racisms problem. If there one day is a change and there are no more black deaths then that the problem of non racial unjustified deaths by the police would still be a problem. \n\nIt\u2019s impossible to destroy an ideology, you can only suppress it and stop its people from acting out on those beliefs, that\u2019s the best we can actually hope for that is somewhat feasible. There will always be that few people who will act anyway, however most others won\u2019t. \n\nThere will always be racists for as long as there is more than one race. You can educate, Punish, shun them etc to try and solve the issue as best as possible. However, protests and riots and black out Tuesday etc will have no effect against the root problem. People are protesting in country that has a government that is >openly< is against racism. It\u2019s not a protest against a government that promotes slavery. Protests then would be more effective.\n\nI don\u2019t see what protests accomplish. The protests have evolved into looting. It\u2019ll be fair for People who are victims of looting to start despising the culprits and since the looting is done in the name of Floyd then you\u2019ll only end up creating a new breed of people with hate. I\u2019m sure you also don\u2019t see looting as a good thing, however it\u2019s a side effect of people possessing the wrong perspective and taking their anger out on those who have NOTHING to do with it.\n\nThe solution? I am not too sure. You can\u2019t really stop police brutality in its entirety and neither can you do the same with racism since people who are either can easily blend in with the rest and there isn\u2019t a way to read minds. \n\nWe can start with punishing all police who enacted unreasonable force against anyone EQUALLY and not consider the matter racially charged wether it\u2019s through the media or otherwise UNTIL further evidence shows otherwise. A huge problem in all this is the media. People\u2019s entire belief system is changed and shaped based on what they read in the news. They might think they are making independent conclusions but it\u2019s impossible to do so when the information given to you only leads on way.",

If I am a bully and punch someone who is of another skin colour in the face, it shouldn\u2019t be seen as racist until proven otherwise. Same if someone of another skin colour punched my face. If racism is the first thing you jump to then there are more pressing self issues you need to attend to.\n\nNot saying there aren\u2019t racist cops but unless you can prove to me otherwise with some evidence, what happened in America was 100% not racially charged. It was just another case of police brutality.",

Because hell, I might one day be a victim of this whole police brutality. \n\nI am just saying that this should instead be recognised as an abuse of power problem as a whole and not JUST a racisms problem. If there one day is a change and there are no more black deaths then that the problem of non racial unjustified deaths by the police would still be a problem. \n\nIt\u2019s impossible to destroy an ideology, you can only suppress it and stop its people from acting out on those beliefs, that\u2019s the best we can actually hope for that is somewhat feasible. There will always be that few people who will act anyway, however most others won\u2019t. \n\nThere will always be racists for as long as there is more than one race. You can educate, Punish, shun them etc to try and solve the issue as best as possible. However, protests and riots and black out Tuesday etc will have no effect against the root problem. People are protesting in country that has a government that is >openly< is against racism. It\u2019s not a protest against a government that promotes slavery. Protests then would be more effective.\n\nI don\u2019t see what protests accomplish. The protests have evolved into looting. It\u2019ll be fair for People who are victims of looting to start despising the culprits and since the looting is done in the name of Floyd then you\u2019ll only end up creating a new breed of people with hate. I\u2019m sure you also don\u2019t see looting as a good thing, however it\u2019s a side effect of people possessing the wrong perspective and taking their anger out on those who have NOTHING to do with it.\n\nThe solution? I am not too sure. You can\u2019t really stop police brutality in its entirety and neither can you do the same with racism since people who are either can easily blend in with the rest and there isn\u2019t a way to read minds. \n\nWe can start with punishing all police who enacted unreasonable force against anyone EQUALLY and not consider the matter racially charged wether it\u2019s through the media or otherwise UNTIL further evidence shows otherwise. A huge problem in all this is the media. People\u2019s entire belief system is changed and shaped based on what they read in the news. They might think they are making independent conclusions but it\u2019s impossible to do so when the information given to you only leads on way.",

Because hell, I might one day be a victim of this whole police brutality. \n\nI am just saying that this should instead be recognised as an abuse of power problem as a whole and not JUST a racisms problem. If there one day is a change and there are no more black deaths then that the problem of non racial unjustified deaths by the police would still be a problem. \n\nIt\u2019s impossible to destroy an ideology, you can only suppress it and stop its people from acting out on those beliefs, that\u2019s the best we can actually hope for that is somewhat feasible. There will always be that few people who will act anyway, however most others won\u2019t. \n\nThere will always be racists for as long as there is more than one race. You can educate, Punish, shun them etc to try and solve the issue as best as possible. However, protests and riots and black out Tuesday etc will have no effect against the root problem. People are protesting in country that has a government that is >openly< is against racism. It\u2019s not a protest against a government that promotes slavery. Protests then would be more effective.\n\nI don\u2019t see what protests accomplish. The protests have evolved into looting. It\u2019ll be fair for People who are victims of looting to start despising the culprits and since the looting is done in the name of Floyd then you\u2019ll only end up creating a new breed of people with hate. I\u2019m sure you also don\u2019t see looting as a good thing, however it\u2019s a side effect of people possessing the wrong perspective and taking their anger out on those who have NOTHING to do with it.\n\nThe solution? I am not too sure. You can\u2019t really stop police brutality in its entirety and neither can you do the same with racism since people who are either can easily blend in with the rest and there isn\u2019t a way to read minds. \n\nWe can start with punishing all police who enacted unreasonable force against anyone EQUALLY and not consider the matter racially charged wether it\u2019s through the media or otherwise UNTIL further evidence shows otherwise. A huge problem in all this is the media. People\u2019s entire belief system is changed and shaped based on what they read in the news. They might think they are making independent conclusions but it\u2019s impossible to do so when the information given to you only leads on way.",

The whole \u201cpolice kill White People too\u201d isn\u2019t supposed to be a defence, it\u2019s supposed to be a point to show that not every death has racially charged intentions behind it. If I am a bully and punch someone who is of another skin colour in the face, it shouldn\u2019t be seen as racist until proven otherwise. Same if someone of another skin colour punched my face. If racism is the first thing you jump to then there are more pressing self issues you need to attend to.\n\nNot saying there aren\u2019t racist cops but unless you can prove to me otherwise with some evidence, what happened in America was 100% not racially charged. It was just another case of police brutality.",
