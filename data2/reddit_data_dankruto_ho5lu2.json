The leaf village was really a thought experiment by Hashirama and Madara. The Uchiha clan brought stability in the guise of cooperation of previously opposing forces. The Uchihas had been there from the beginning- before the Sarutobi or the Hyuuga. To ostracize the clan from the rest of the population meant losing face. To make someone lose that much face, especially in the Edo era, would have prompted either seppuku or war. I\u2019m not surprised at the ill will generated sand the need for revenge.",

The leaf village was really a thought experiment by Hashirama and Madara. The Uchiha clan brought stability in the guise of cooperation of previously opposing forces.

To make someone lose that much face, especially in the Edo era, would have prompted either seppuku or war. I\u2019m not surprised at the ill will generated sand the need for revenge.",
