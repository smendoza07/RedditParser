    "body": "I made the mistake of trusting my brother with this secret. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m too proud of doing, but I\u2019m not morally opposed to living this lifestyle either. Now any time we get into an argument, he calls me a \u201cprostie\u201d and threatens to put me on blast. He thinks he has the moral high ground because he\u2019ll be making money \u201cthe honest way\u201d. This is coming from the man who has no moral opposition to bombing civilian occupied villages in the Middle East because \u201cthey were already going to blow themselves up so I might as well do it for them\u201d.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to want to open up to one\u2019s sibling, if they think they\u2019ll understand.

Men often get jealous of this female receiving thing\u2026even if you are like, a waitress making tons of tips a lot of men will get upset for how \u201ceasy\u201d it is for you. In general, I\u2019ve learned to keep money matters as secret as I can from men.

There\u2019s also numerous tv shows glamorizing serial killers, that doesn\u2019t mean the average Joe thinks it\u2019s cool to be a serial killer. But they\u2019ll enjoy the show. So will I.
