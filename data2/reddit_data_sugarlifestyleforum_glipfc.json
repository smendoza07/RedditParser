    "body": "A discussion on here yesterday, a self-described, socially awkward SD was concerned because he was never married and never had a long-term vanilla relationship. It got me thinking about the immeasurable joy, satisfaction, and pleasure I have gotten from my SR's over the years. I am single and living the life now I wish I had lived in my 40's and 50's. I have had so many wonderful experiences with so many wonderful women I would never have had except through sugaring.\n\nI have to say to you SB's, thank you for making my life, and I am sure many other SD's lives, richer, more rewarding, and more fulfilled.  I am a better man because of having you in my life.",

A responsible SD understands that and is comfortable handling such things in a way that is both comforting and respectful of the SB and the relationship.\n\nIf your potential SD is unwilling to deliver on his part of the arrangement prior to any intimacy you should come to a full stop.  It is the job of the SD to relieve financial pressure, exposure and anxiety.

I always tell them this lifestyle level up doesn't work because of me... and my program... it works because you took action with the tools given in the program. These ladies can give you all the best advice but if you don't apply it and take action you'll get no where... community is vital",

A responsible SD understands that and is comfortable handling such things in a way that is both comforting and respectful of the SB and the relationship.\n\nIf your potential SD is unwilling to deliver on his part of the arrangement prior to any intimacy you should come to a full stop.
