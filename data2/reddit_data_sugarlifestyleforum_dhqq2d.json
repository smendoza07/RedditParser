    "body": "Through a online, platonic thing that I accidentally fell into. I know, I know, neither of those things exist, whatever. \n\nHe does exist though, and it's kind of wild. We've formed a very strange special little friendship that isn't sexual in nature, through a dating app, off of which I told him I'm a sugar baby. He told me he isn't a sugar daddy however, and doesn't plan to be. But, since then we talk most days, I talk to him about a lot of his dating problems while he's jet setting around the place and he has taken a massive interest in my art, bought several pieces, and given me larger transfers to \"sponsor\" my supplies or enable me to be able to print more. This week he got my eyes tested. \n\nSo, tonight I was in maccas complaining to him between mouthfuls of hot cake (endearing, I know) about the very very shitty POT date I went on tonight, when I got a secondary call from my flatmates who were babysitting my dog during said date, to say that my dog had eaten a Toblerone. Yup. Like a full one. A full giant ass dark chocolate toblerone. \n\nAll jets are go, I'm running red lights to get home to get her to the emergency vet, crying like a lunatic, poor noodle was so confused but loves the car so was pleased with her midnight outing, until we got there. \nNot so great once we got there, everything was looking pretty grim and the vets kept not telling me whether she was going to pull through. They kept quoting me more and more, but like, I've got $17 in my bank account until payday but I kept telling them to do whatever to make it work. \n\nBefore any of y'all are like \"its just a dog\", it's not. It's my goofy goober of a alien horse, I'm an introverted artist and I spend every minute of my day with her. I mean she goes to galleries and showing and art markets and music performance and bars, she's in training currently to be able to put me in recovery when I have seizures so I don't die. She's a superdog, and the light of my fucking life. \n\nSo, this guy was on the phone to me when I first learnt and naturally he had offered to pay. Eventually, I said yes. $900, morphine, induced vomiting, 3 lots of charcoal, 1.5 litres of IV and a couple nights in hospital, and shes gonna live. \n\nThis is why I love the bowl. It's not straight up and down, it's frustrating and never hands me what I expect, but god damn a sugar stranger saved the light of my life tonight. \nY'all, sometimes SB emergencies actually exist.",

I did just want to note though that we don't reaaallllyyy need to worry too much when our dogs eat chocolate. Of course a whole Toblerone bar is quite a bit, but the dangerous chemicals is the theobromine, which is found in PURE chocolate but is pretty low in most commercial chocolate bars.\n\nPeople tend to think that ANY kind of chocolate in any form will kill your dogs - not true! theobromine and caffeine affect the central nervous system and can cause your dog's heart rate to increase and potentially lead to death but fairly unlikely from any standard americanized/commercial chocolate bar (unless the dog weighs like 3 lbs and ate a whole bar of pure dark chocolate). But chocolate in general is not very dangerous. Of course, a vet isn't necessarily going to tell you not to worry because they will gladly take your money. Here's a calculator to determine if you need to worry:  [http://www.anycalculator.com/dogtoxicitycalculator.html](http://www.anycalculator.com/dogtoxicitycalculator.html)\n\nRegardless, my giant dog-mom heart is so happy to hear your little alien babe is ok!",

Also the smallest fartiest old dude. \nIdk if this is a worldwide thing, but in NZ our beaches have this habit of killing people with our currents, so you swim between these flags to stay safe.

I have a couple friends like this, one in sweden who I speak to pretty regularly. we tell each other our secrets, the things we worry about but can't tell our friends because then our friends will have follow up questions. There's something incredibly relaxing about having a friend you can confide in, who is there when you need them, but doesn't ask for too much in return. Just friendship. Not going to nag you or anything and can keep your secrets because who am I gonna tell???  \n\n\nI've had a handful of these friendships since I started using the internet, and I can truly say that they were appreciated with every ounce of my heart.",
