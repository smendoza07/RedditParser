So it would kill Sasuke if he tried now going off the latest continuity.\n\nPlus really what would Konan know about that jutsu and what the result of using it would be. \n\nIt\u2019s just anime logic. Same with might guy just knowing that evening elephant and night guy were in his 8 gates arsenal, which would kinda imply that he needed to go 8 gates before in order to know that, but it doesn\u2019t make sense since it results in death.\n\nPretty much all the \u201cthis is my final move, but it kills me\u201d type thing that\u2019s present throughout many anime. It\u2019s just a cognitive dissonance thing we need to accept",
