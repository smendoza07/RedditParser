    "body": " \n\nThe average man tends to lack general hair styling knowledge, since it isn\u2019t plainly or cohesively explained very often. This manuscript serves as a simple, comprehensive guide for the average man to consistently, quickly, and easily have salon-quality hair on a daily basis. This guide is organized into three subcategories for your convenience.\n\n* Disclaimer: For whatever reasons, some guys seem to think it\u2019s *gay* or *effeminate* to condition and maintain your hair. It\u2019s not.\n\n**SHOWER**\n\nThe distinctive qualities of stylish hair are the form and texture. Showering with the right products provides the base for a good style.\n\n1 Use *volumizing* or *thickening* shampoos\n\n* Look for shampoos that contain **biotin** or **collagen**. Most reliable products contain these ingredients because they are responsible for providing cell structure, which for our purposes means thick, dense, and healthy hair.\n* Don\u2019t use shampoo *every* day. Shampoos by design are meant to strip oils, grime, dirt, and other impurities from the scalp. But hair is meant to have certain healthy oils to keep the follicle and shaft lubricated, hydrated, and nourished. Overuse of shampoo dries out the scalp, starving it of these essential components. Use shampoo only when your hair appears greasy or if you haven\u2019t used it a handful of days.\n\n2 Conditioner is optional\n\n* Use a conditioner if your hair is dry. Conditioners by design are meant to hydrate hair, providing sheen with a soft, luscious quality.\n* Don\u2019t use a conditioner if your hair is fine, thin, limp, or oily. Conditioners will make greasy hair greasier. Most conditioners are heavy in a sense that they weigh down hair. This makes limp hair appear even more flat. Hair that\u2019s heavy from conditioners is also hard to style effectively.\n* Look for a *weightless* and volumizing conditioner if you decide to use one. Use a small amount of conditioner, about a dime sized amount. Apply conditioner to the shaft of the hair, but not the roots. This helps prevent weighing hair down.\n* Conditioner affects your hair aesthetically in different ways depending on how much you use and the quality of your hair. So experiment with it to find the best results, which could come from using none at all.\n\n**DRYING**\n\nThe most vital factor to having excellent salon-quality hair that *keeps its hold* is how you dry it. The key to **ALL** salon-quality hairstyles is a combination of heat, water, and direction. Hair will stay in the direction it's dried if you comb it as you dry it. The heat from a blow dryer will perforate the shaft of the hair, making the filaments expand and the pores expand. This makes the hair retain the direction it\u2019s combed and provides volume. Also, some people use a pre-styler before they dry their hair to give their hair distinctive features. \n\n1 Towel dry your hair until it\u2019s damp but not dry.\n\n2 Pre-styler (optional)\n\n* Sea salt spray: Adds a distinct texture, due to the salts property of retaining moisture\n* Argan oil: Provides a rich, deep, coppery shine and protects against heat from the dryer\n* Coconut oil: hydrates, shines, and has a coconut scent\n* Moroccan oil: hydrates, shines, and softens hair, as well as adding shine. Rich in **vitamins** and **antioxidants**\n\n3 Comb your hair.\n\n* Preferably, using a wide-tooth comb at first, then a fine tooth comb. Using a fine tooth comb first on wet hair before its general shape has been established can slightly damage hair due to the yanking motion from moving the heavy, wet hair so forcefully.\n* Comb the top part of your hair back (slick back), to the side (comb-over), or a combination of these two. This creates volume, which is a very desirable feature in good hair.\n* Comb the sides behind your ears or straight down against your head. Don\u2019t generate volume on the sides.\n* Comb the back flat against your head. Don\u2019t generate volume in the back.\n\n4 Use a hair dryer and a comb (or a **hair styler**) to dry your hair. **Comb it and dry it at the same time in the same direction.**\n\n* Use medium heat\n* Dry it in the direction that you combed it.\n* Comb it as you dry it. (the most vital step)\n* Dry your hair abiding by this technique until it is about 90% or 100% dry.\n\n5 Dry and comb your hair again with the *cool* setting.\n\n* The cool air contracts the pores. This \u201clocks\u201d your hair in place.\n\n**PRODUCT**\n\nIf your hair has been dried correctly, your hair should have a definite shape with lots of volume on top. The hair should keep its hold reasonably well. Adding product is the final step to preserve how long your hair remains in this state. Products also exemplify your hair\u2019s texture, shine, and shape.\n\n1 Select a product\n\n* Creams: flexible, looser substances that provide a more natural, loose, and messy hold without adding much shine.\n* Gels: Keeps your hair stiff and shiny, but doesn\u2019t add too much volume. Adding too much will make your hair *crunchy*\n* Pomades: appears as either a heavy white cream based or hard, clear gel based. Pomades possess a higher hold that adds volume and often adds high shine\n* Clays: Heavy, white, hard substance that adds volume with a *matte* finish\n\n2 Emulsify the product\n\n* In *Layman\u2019s terms* that just means take a small amount and rub it into your hands until you can\u2019t see it anymore\n* This ensures even distribution and prevents clumps\n* Use a dime or quarter sized amount\n\n3 Apply product to hair\n\n* Focus on the roots and sections with distinct partings. For example, if you have a comb over, focus most of the product on the actual part where the hair flips over\n* Add some under your bangs and go up\n* Emulsify more and repeat for each section of your hair\n* Don\u2019t put much on the sides and back. Wipe off excess products there instead.\n* Push the sides and back flat against your head with the product\n\n4 Comb the hair again after the product is in your hair\n\n* Use your hands if you want a more *natural* look\n\nIn conclusion, these are the fundamentals of styling men\u2019s hair that works with the vast majority of haircuts. Ideally, your haircut should be longer on the top, with *layers*, and *thinned out*, *tapered*, or *faded* at the back and sides to keep it proportional. Consult with your barber or stylist for the best looks. Also, although these steps may seem long and tedious, with practice you can achieve consistent, remarkable style in less than 10 minutes.\n\n* An even quicker, more compact version of these methods is to just wet your hair, dry it using proper techniques, then add product.\n\n* Check out [Alex Costa](https://youtu.be/-zlvkz9WDR8), [Alpha M](https://youtu.be/8irflrbt6k8), [Weston Boucher](https://youtu.be/LpQYUZEN5wk), and [Blu Maan](https://youtu.be/oVjXjvZKOrk) for excellent live examples to follow.",

You might succeed, but it can take a fair amount of effort. I know from experience.\n\nIf instead you want to try and work with your natural hair texture and bring out the best in it, pop over to /r/CurlyHair to work out a curly hair routine. It is a little bit involved at least to begin with, but once it becomes part of your life it may end up being less work! For me I spend a lot less time trying to make my hair look a certain way in the mornings - although partly I will admit this correlates with working from home all the time now - and just let the curls roll their own way, and it usually looks pretty good.",

See Wikipedia \ud83d\udc40\n\nI don't know if it's been mentioned, but I would also recommend not using high heat on your hair as you're drying it except for maybe in the back... However, I'd recommend using warm if not cool air drying the top.\n\nHot hair dryer air not good particularly with thinning hair. Plus there's been a million, perhaps trillions of cases of people particularly women frying their hair. And some of that is mostly with a hot iron, but over the long haul I believe warm to cool air will save you a little If not a lot more hair if you will.\n\nAlso I would recommend only washing your hair 2-3 days a week...If that's a possibility and you don't have super unruly hair. \n\nI do have unruly hair / I'm French and German mostly, however have kind of Asian hair with a lot of cowlicks. And right now I'm working from home... And I usually just wet it put some Argan styling lotion/oil, then stick a cool/warm hair dryer to it and voila... a little product. I use Redken or Aveda typically a little mixture of grooming clay with a touch of pomade to give it a slight shine.\n\nMy $0.01 worth \n\nGood stuff OP!",

But if it clumps up or clogs the drain or there's more than a few that's a bad sign.\n\nTo diagnose yourself, check out the [Norwood-Hamilton scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton%E2%80%93Norwood_scale?wprov=sfla1) of male-pattern baldness.\n\nBeing a Norwood I is not hairloss, and being Norwood II is heavily debated among the community, but regardless isn't that significant.\n\nLook for miniaturizing hairs to see if you have hair loss. Miniaturizing hairs are those short fine ingrown \"baby\" hairs at your hairline. These hairs are small because DHT, a hair-loss androgen, is encapsulating your hair follicle and snuffing it out.",

It also helps condition the hair too; I've noticed a vast improvement in the health of my hair since I've started using them.\n\nHere's the best ones I've discovered for my hair type:\n\n* Almond Sweet Oil\n* Macadamia Nut Oil\n* Marula Oil\n* Jojoba Oil\n\nThere are others (Argan, Castor etc etc) but I've found the above best for my hair type.\n\nI've also found it's way cheaper to buy the oils in their pure form from Amazon or somewhere as opposed to buying a branded product that either contain loads of added chemicals or are just super overpriced for what you get. For example, a 500ml bottle of Almond Sweet oil was like \u00a35, whereas buying a small bottle of, say, Bluuman's Cloud Control, would set you back around \u00a320.\n\nDepending on hair thickness, use just a few drops (I have to use literally loads as my hair just soaks it up) and use it as a pre-blow dry or just let to dry naturally and brush if necessary.\n\nI often combine them and make a hot oil hair mask which I leave in for a few hours and wash out for a deep treatment.\n\nHope this helps!",

But if it clumps up or clogs the drain or there's more than a few that's a bad sign.\n\nTo diagnose yourself, check out the [Norwood-Hamilton scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton%E2%80%93Norwood_scale?wprov=sfla1) of male-pattern baldness.\n\nBeing a Norwood I is not hairloss, and being Norwood II is heavily debated among the community, but regardless isn't that significant.\n\nLook for miniaturizing hairs to see if you have hair loss. Miniaturizing hairs are those short fine ingrown \"baby\" hairs at your hairline. These hairs are small because DHT, a hair-loss androgen, is encapsulating your hair follicle and snuffing it out.",
