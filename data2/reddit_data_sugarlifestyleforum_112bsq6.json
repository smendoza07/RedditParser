    "body": "I\u2019m posting this so SD\u2019s can realize their behavior and stop. We\u2019ve discussed this on the other forum, so I know other women experience this and either 1) grin and bear it because she can\u2019t afford to risk the financial support by saying anything 2) your SB will start making excuses so she doesn\u2019t have to stay the night. \n\n1. Snoring like a grizzly bear. How many hours do you think you can tolerate sleeping next to a bear? I understand this isn\u2019t something you can necessarily \u201cfix\u201d, but there are things you can do to make it more tolerable for her. Offer solutions. \n\n2. Waking her up multiple times in the middle of the night pestering for sex. Let the girl sleep!! Especially if she came over after work, or you guys went out the night before & had a great dinner followed by sex. Allow her beauty sleep, and caress her back and neck, and she will show appreciation and be well rested for morning sex. \n\n3. Smothering her. She just catered to you for the last 12+ hours, if she wants to shower alone, let her! Most women have morning skin/hair routines, want to shave, or like to gather our daily thoughts.\n\n4. When she\u2019s ready to leave, don\u2019t make it hard. You don\u2019t need to passive aggressively ask what other plans she has.. Maybe she just misses the comfort of her own bed or her dog/cat.\n\nI enjoy overnights with my SD\u2019s, and think they allow 1-on-1 time to get to know each other and have intimate moments, but that behavior honestly takes the joy right out of it.",

I warn them ahead of time, offer the SB a different room if she prefers, and use a customized mouthguard that helps eliminate snoring. I also make sure that while she is welcome, overnights are not necessity (unless we are traveling, of course).",

As others have pointed out, sleeping alone tends to result in the best sleep, particularly once you get the oxytocin flowing post-sex.   \n\n\nWhile I do enjoy falling asleep and cuddling, the practical side of it is that some cannot tolerate any snoring. At least if my SB stays over, I can make breakfast in the morning (which is one of my favorite activities). So it's a good enticement to stay. :)",

And I'm not sending her home in the middle of the night, nor do they want to leave, obviously. My goal from the outset is to make my home as comfortable and inviting as possible for my overnight SB guest; which in part includes exclusive use of a well stocked guest bathroom. I want her to feel as comfortable and cared for as possible in my space.  Why wouldn't any legit SD want that for his SB?  Believe me, I know how difficult it can be sharing sleeping quarters and bathrooms with other people after a career spent sharing fire station barracks, fire camp group sleeping spaces and hotel rooms, with guys who snore like chainsaws, thrash and grunt and fart all night like cows.  Fortunately, I don't snore ( guys take note: one of the benefits of staying fit one's entire life)  What was originally intended as a 2nd bedroom is my home office. So I don't have a guestroom to offer up in the rare instance of incompatible sleep habits/needs. But in order to make it work, on a couple of occasions I've moved to the couch - it's no sacrifice. It's a simple concept... A comfortable and well rested SB is a happy appreciative SB. And that's always a good thing. Often first thing in the morning,  if ya know what I mean \ud83d\ude09",

You don\u2019t wake up your partner from a sound sleep to fuck unless you\u2019re trying to get the most bang for your buck (literally) which isn\u2019t something you\u2019d do in a relationship.

As do a lot of younger women, especially if they drink, but it\u2019s certainly more common with older men.

And yes, of course you shouldn't wake up your partner if they have to wake up early.\n\nI guess I was fortunate with the previous,  7 year SB.   Sometimes she woke me up and sometimes I woke her up.   I would guess it was roughly an equal number of times as far as who woke who up.   The majority of the time, the other was interested.   Occasionally,  the other was not, and their wishes were respected with no whining or anything.    \n\nIt comes down to communicating with your partner.    But someone waking you up for sex is not usually an annoying thing, IMHO.   Me, I found it flattering even if I was worn out from multiple rounds.",

I would bet in most cases it\u2019s a John who\u2019s seeing an escort calling herself and SB or treating an actual SB like an escort.  You don\u2019t wake up your partner from a sound sleep to fuck unless you\u2019re trying to get the most bang for your buck (literally) which isn\u2019t something you\u2019d do in a relationship.   Regardless, no one is going to read that post and say \u201coh shit I should be a decent human and not treat this girl like a sex toy.\u201d\n\nAs to number 3, as I said in my prior comment, it comes down to a conversation and no decent guy is going to give her a hard time.  Again, maybe some escort charging a client a normal PPM per hour is going to experience something differently, but a decent SD is not going to behave that way, and no one reading her post is going to change their behavior.",

Just because you don\u2019t need this doesn\u2019t mean no one else does either?\nThat\u2019s like going into primary school and screaming everyone knows this!!\nWell some people don\u2019t. \n\nI have seen a few guys admitting to their snoring in the comments. Some people just need incentive to take action. \nIf guys are doing the other things on the post, why on earth would they out themselves? It\u2019s embarrassing.\n\nRespectfully, as an SD, you have no idea what it\u2019s like to be with other SDs. As an SB, I can\u2019t say I don\u2019t react like X so NO OTHER SB\u2019s react like X.\n\nClearly if OP went through the trouble of writing the post, it\u2019s safe to say that SOME men acted like that. If SB\u2019s have discussed the topic before, clearly it\u2019s an issue. Why\u2019s that so hard to understand? It may be a negative post but I\u2019m SURE experiencing that is negative as well.\n\nHow delusional do you have to be for someone to outline their experience and counter it with **ACTUALLY, that doesn\u2019t exist**\n\nLook how many women are in agreement in the comments. It obviously needed to be said. Now some guys can see why their relationship may not have worked out. Some people are not self aware, and it\u2019s an insult to those who are changing their behaviour to say \u201cno one needs this\u201d.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019ve only experienced snoring.

As do a lot of younger women, especially if they drink, but it\u2019s certainly more common with older men.  That\u2019s not news and it\u2019s not that men are \u201cadmitting\u201d it and realizing \u201comg I had no idea.\u201d   \n\nAs to the other behaviors, my point is that the men doing them are not behaving as SDs and that the SBs should not stay with them.  Sounds like a pro-SB argument to me, yet I\u2019m lableles as the negative toxic SD.  \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

I would bet in most cases it\u2019s a John who\u2019s seeing an escort calling herself and SB or treating an actual SB like an escort.  You don\u2019t wake up your partner from a sound sleep to fuck unless you\u2019re trying to get the most bang for your buck (literally) which isn\u2019t something you\u2019d do in a relationship.

Again, maybe some escort charging a client a normal PPM per hour is going to experience something differently, but a decent SD is not going to behave that way, and no one reading her post is going to change their behavior.",

Regardless, no one is going to read that post and say \u201coh shit I should be a decent human and not treat this girl like a sex toy.\u201d\n\nAs to number 3, as I said in my prior comment, it comes down to a conversation and no decent guy is going to give her a hard time.  Again, maybe some escort charging a client a normal PPM per hour is going to experience something differently, but a decent SD is not going to behave that way, and no one reading her post is going to change their behavior.",

It may be a negative post but I\u2019m SURE experiencing that is negative as well.\n\nHow delusional do you have to be for someone to outline their experience and counter it with **ACTUALLY, that doesn\u2019t exist**\n\nLook how many women are in agreement in the comments. It obviously needed to be said. Now some guys can see why their relationship may not have worked out. Some people are not self aware, and it\u2019s an insult to those who are changing their behaviour to say \u201cno one needs this\u201d.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019ve only experienced snoring.

As do a lot of younger women, especially if they drink, but it\u2019s certainly more common with older men.  That\u2019s not news and it\u2019s not that men are \u201cadmitting\u201d it and realizing \u201comg I had no idea.\u201d   \n\nAs to the other behaviors, my point is that the men doing them are not behaving as SDs and that the SBs should not stay with them.  Sounds like a pro-SB argument to me, yet I\u2019m lableles as the negative toxic SD.  \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

As an SB, I can\u2019t say I don\u2019t react like X so NO OTHER SB\u2019s react like X.\n\nClearly if OP went through the trouble of writing the post, it\u2019s safe to say that SOME men acted like that. If SB\u2019s have discussed the topic before, clearly it\u2019s an issue. Why\u2019s that so hard to understand? It may be a negative post but I\u2019m SURE experiencing that is negative as well.\n\nHow delusional do you have to be for someone to outline their experience and counter it with **ACTUALLY, that doesn\u2019t exist**\n\nLook how many women are in agreement in the comments. It obviously needed to be said. Now some guys can see why their relationship may not have worked out. Some people are not self aware, and it\u2019s an insult to those who are changing their behaviour to say \u201cno one needs this\u201d.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019ve only experienced snoring. But I\u2019m not an experienced SB. NEITHER ARE YOU.",

As do a lot of younger women, especially if they drink, but it\u2019s certainly more common with older men.  That\u2019s not news and it\u2019s not that men are \u201cadmitting\u201d it and realizing \u201comg I had no idea.\u201d   \n\nAs to the other behaviors, my point is that the men doing them are not behaving as SDs and that the SBs should not stay with them.  Sounds like a pro-SB argument to me, yet I\u2019m lableles as the negative toxic SD.  \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

As do a lot of younger women, especially if they drink, but it\u2019s certainly more common with older men.  That\u2019s not news and it\u2019s not that men are \u201cadmitting\u201d it and realizing \u201comg I had no idea.\u201d   \n\nAs to the other behaviors, my point is that the men doing them are not behaving as SDs and that the SBs should not stay with them.  Sounds like a pro-SB argument to me, yet I\u2019m lableles as the negative toxic SD.  \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
