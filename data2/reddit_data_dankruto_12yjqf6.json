Naruto and Sasuke, Rock Lee and Gaara, Hinata and Neji, Asura and Indra, just to name a few.\n\nI never said Naruto (the character) didn't put in hard work.

Naruto and Sasuke, Rock Lee and Gaara, Hinata and Neji, Asura and Indra, just to name a few.\n\nI never said Naruto (the character) didn't put in hard work.

That's not what I meant. I meant that she is a foil to Neji and her sister. She is relatively untalented compared to them. That's why she didn't have confidence.\n\nBy the same definition, Rock Lee and Naruto are also talented in their own way. I never said they're not, I'm saying they are a foil to the more talented genius rivals they have.",
