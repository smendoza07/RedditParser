    "body": "I feel like I hit the jackpot yesterday.  I just started a new arrangement with an amazing young woman.  Someone I had known casually for a while and it's actually the first time I have successfully freestyled. She hogs the covers and talks in her sleep but even though I am exhausted today I still feel like I am on cloud nine. \n\nI often see people talk a lot about what a SD can do for a SB.  But I think that aside from the obvious we don't talk enough about what benefits a SD gets from his SB.\n\nNot just sex, but romance is a big part of what drives a man to do what he does.  It drives us to work hard and make something of ourselves.  When you have a good woman in your life as a man it allows you to focus and to be at peace.  And I think that goes double for an older man with a sugar baby.  I think that the youth and vitality of the SB rubs off a little on the SD and makes life seem brighter.  Or at least that's how I feel when I am with a good sugar baby.\n\nToday I am running on about three hours of sleep but I feel on top of the world.  Eager to crush it in the gym and in my business.  And I know that a big part of the reason I feel this way is that I now feel like I have that romance part of my life handled and it leaves my mind free to focus on other things.\n\nSo I just want to say thank you to all the quality sugar babies out there that make this lifestyle worth it.",
