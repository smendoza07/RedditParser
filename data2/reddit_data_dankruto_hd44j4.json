Kakashi, Guy, Asuma and Yamato are too much though. \n\nSai is definitely in the lower-mid range of jounin-level. You all sleep on his insane versatility.",

Even worse, if Naruto got too tired physically or emotionally he could lose control again. Without Yamato, Jiraiya had to be extra careful. Hence he just had him perfect the Odama Rasengan and brush up on tactics (which pays off in the Pain fight).\n\nAt the very least Naruto sort of gained access to Version 2 four tails which nearly kicked Orochimaru's ass. Before the incident I'm pretty sure he got to fully control version 1 three tails too.",

He's useful as a ninja and shows skill at actual stealth and secrecy, and could probably stand his own against many of the rest, but he doesnt seem like the strongest by a while, using info that mainly came from the exam tournament",

Also, I thought it was generally believed that the fillers in boruto were canon.",

The only canon new gen characters are team 7, team 10, mental Lee and sumire, metal appered for one panel and sumire appered for maybe 3. \n\n>and that\u2019s cool about naruto fillers i guess. but give me one way you can tell me the mitsuki arc is filler other than it\u2019s lack of being in the manga i won\u2019t even try to debate it.\n\nWhy didn't the karma of boruto activated when he fought against the clay people that basically fucked him but it did activated against green choji, I will tell you why because that arc didn't happen and the tento arc happened 3 days after the chunin exams.\n\n>Literally a kage died and you\u2019re telling me it\u2019s filler LOL\n\nHe died in the time skip between the last and boruto lol\n\n>The anime has adapted 3 arcs.\n\nIt adapted the chunin exams and the 3 chapters of the tento mini arc. I don't see any 3rd arc here\n\n>and if you\u2019re hating on boruto cause of the urashiki arc then stop. everyone knows it\u2019s the worst arc but that doesn\u2019t give incentive to trip on the whole show\n\nI am hating on the anime because it doesn't adapt the manga properly and as an anime alone it's total garbage given the amount of nothing that's happening in most of the show, if you are enjoying it then I am happy for you but don't spread misinformation about the events of the show being canonical to the manga.\n\n>If you didn\u2019t wanna wait so long to see manga content Then don\u2019t read the manga or don\u2019t watch the anime \n\nFirst of all your sentence made no sense at all, Second of all I am more of a manga person in general so I don't read because I can't wait I read because it's more enjoyable for me than watching the anime especially for shows like boruto who will never get anywhere.",

Even worse, if Naruto got too tired physically or emotionally he could lose control again. Without Yamato, Jiraiya had to be extra careful. Hence he just had him perfect the Odama Rasengan and brush up on tactics (which pays off in the Pain fight).\n\nAt the very least Naruto sort of gained access to Version 2 four tails which nearly kicked Orochimaru's ass. Before the incident I'm pretty sure he got to fully control version 1 three tails too.",

He's useful as a ninja and shows skill at actual stealth and secrecy, and could probably stand his own against many of the rest, but he doesnt seem like the strongest by a while, using info that mainly came from the exam tournament",

There's no medical ninjutsu able to repair it and depending on the severity of the damages some people might not be able to perform jutsu after that. Tsunade classified it as a forbidden jutsu after the fight with kakuzo, because it would not only inflict damage in the opponent but also in the user because both were in the area of the explosion. However naruto was able to overcome this con by trowing it, this way he wouldn't be hit by it's own atack.",

Even worse, if Naruto got too tired physically or emotionally he could lose control again. Without Yamato, Jiraiya had to be extra careful. Hence he just had him perfect the Odama Rasengan and brush up on tactics (which pays off in the Pain fight).\n\nAt the very least Naruto sort of gained access to Version 2 four tails which nearly kicked Orochimaru's ass. Before the incident I'm pretty sure he got to fully control version 1 three tails too.",

After Naruto learned it as a genin in a few days (!), Naruto used the same method to teach Konohamaru, who successfully learned it as a genin.  Konohamaruo taught Boruto the same way, who successfully learned it as a genin.  So a jutsu so difficult that only Minato, Jiraiya, and Kakashi could use it at first, was taught to 3 genins with a 100% success rate using Jiraiya's method.",

Even after 3 years of training with Jiraiya Naruto still needed clones to do a Rasengan.

He's useful as a ninja and shows skill at actual stealth and secrecy, and could probably stand his own against many of the rest, but he doesnt seem like the strongest by a while, using info that mainly came from the exam tournament",

Just not in the manga\n\nThey can't possibly exist in the manga given the fact that their placement make absolutely no sense in the story and in the timeline.\n\n>Every single one of these arcs will be mentioned within the manga eventually,\n\nNope the only anime only arc that got mentioned is the field trip arc because it was adapted from a light novel.\n\n>the nue arc has happened in the manga because sumire has control over nue\n\nSumire appered in the manga for like 3 panels she is completely insignificant side character \n\n>The Mitsuki arc is 25 episodes and if you tell me there\u2019s 25 consecutive filler episodes then you\u2019re a dumbass\n\nYou have no logic in your statement, the OG naruto had 82 consecutive fillers, Shippuden had multiple 40 consecutive fillers.\n\n>The juugo arc though i don\u2019t think it\u2019s been brought up in the manga or anything but that arc was Damn interesting man it\u2019s my favorite\n\nIt's shit and no it hasn't been brought up in the manga because it's filler just like 99.99% of the anime.\n\nThe anime up until now in 157 episodes adapted only 1 arc from the manga and they put tons of filler inside of it, akhem urashiki and shinki. Most of the anime cast is also filler.",

There's no medical ninjutsu able to repair it and depending on the severity of the damages some people might not be able to perform jutsu after that. Tsunade classified it as a forbidden jutsu after the fight with kakuzo, because it would not only inflict damage in the opponent but also in the user because both were in the area of the explosion. However naruto was able to overcome this con by trowing it, this way he wouldn't be hit by it's own atack.",

Even worse, if Naruto got too tired physically or emotionally he could lose control again. Without Yamato, Jiraiya had to be extra careful. Hence he just had him perfect the Odama Rasengan and brush up on tactics (which pays off in the Pain fight).\n\nAt the very least Naruto sort of gained access to Version 2 four tails which nearly kicked Orochimaru's ass. Before the incident I'm pretty sure he got to fully control version 1 three tails too.",

Naruto needed to use Shadow Clones in order to do it, which, as I said, consumes more chakra and is slower. Even after 3 years of training with Jiraiya Naruto still needed clones to do a Rasengan. Also, Konohamaru learning the Rasengan was almost a joke, cause for him to learn I believe he needed to use Sexy Jutsu for some reason?? Then Boruto basically was handed Rasengan because of plot in 3 days *and* \u201caccidentally\u201d incorporated wind release into it.",

He's useful as a ninja and shows skill at actual stealth and secrecy, and could probably stand his own against many of the rest, but he doesnt seem like the strongest by a while, using info that mainly came from the exam tournament",

Most of the anime cast is also filler.",

Kakashi, Guy, Asuma and Yamato are too much though. \n\nSai is definitely in the lower-mid range of jounin-level. You all sleep on his insane versatility.",

Even worse, if Naruto got too tired physically or emotionally he could lose control again. Without Yamato, Jiraiya had to be extra careful. Hence he just had him perfect the Odama Rasengan and brush up on tactics (which pays off in the Pain fight).\n\nAt the very least Naruto sort of gained access to Version 2 four tails which nearly kicked Orochimaru's ass. Before the incident I'm pretty sure he got to fully control version 1 three tails too.",

He's useful as a ninja and shows skill at actual stealth and secrecy, and could probably stand his own against many of the rest, but he doesnt seem like the strongest by a while, using info that mainly came from the exam tournament",

The only canon new gen characters are team 7, team 10, mental Lee and sumire, metal appered for one panel and sumire appered for maybe 3. \n\n>and that\u2019s cool about naruto fillers i guess. but give me one way you can tell me the mitsuki arc is filler other than it\u2019s lack of being in the manga i won\u2019t even try to debate it.\n\nWhy didn't the karma of boruto activated when he fought against the clay people that basically fucked him but it did activated against green choji, I will tell you why because that arc didn't happen and the tento arc happened 3 days after the chunin exams.\n\n>Literally a kage died and you\u2019re telling me it\u2019s filler LOL\n\nHe died in the time skip between the last and boruto lol\n\n>The anime has adapted 3 arcs.\n\nIt adapted the chunin exams and the 3 chapters of the tento mini arc. I don't see any 3rd arc here\n\n>and if you\u2019re hating on boruto cause of the urashiki arc then stop. everyone knows it\u2019s the worst arc but that doesn\u2019t give incentive to trip on the whole show\n\nI am hating on the anime because it doesn't adapt the manga properly and as an anime alone it's total garbage given the amount of nothing that's happening in most of the show, if you are enjoying it then I am happy for you but don't spread misinformation about the events of the show being canonical to the manga.\n\n>If you didn\u2019t wanna wait so long to see manga content Then don\u2019t read the manga or don\u2019t watch the anime \n\nFirst of all your sentence made no sense at all, Second of all I am more of a manga person in general so I don't read because I can't wait I read because it's more enjoyable for me than watching the anime especially for shows like boruto who will never get anywhere.",

My whole bruh moment started when I came in on the thread imo.\n\nI'm thinking of a jutsu that is this jutsu but in a more logical sense. Its bigger, has windblades that DO affect what the windblades touch while have those mini blades but I feel it makes more logical sense that blades of wind have no set size or shape and SHOULD also affect the person casting it (Naruto) and applying that logic to what we have.\n\nIts 830 and I've been tokin on my dab pen for an hour already",

Even worse, if Naruto got too tired physically or emotionally he could lose control again. Without Yamato, Jiraiya had to be extra careful. Hence he just had him perfect the Odama Rasengan and brush up on tactics (which pays off in the Pain fight).\n\nAt the very least Naruto sort of gained access to Version 2 four tails which nearly kicked Orochimaru's ass. Before the incident I'm pretty sure he got to fully control version 1 three tails too.",

He's useful as a ninja and shows skill at actual stealth and secrecy, and could probably stand his own against many of the rest, but he doesnt seem like the strongest by a while, using info that mainly came from the exam tournament",

There's no medical ninjutsu able to repair it and depending on the severity of the damages some people might not be able to perform jutsu after that. Tsunade classified it as a forbidden jutsu after the fight with kakuzo, because it would not only inflict damage in the opponent but also in the user because both were in the area of the explosion. However naruto was able to overcome this con by trowing it, this way he wouldn't be hit by it's own atack.",

Even worse, if Naruto got too tired physically or emotionally he could lose control again. Without Yamato, Jiraiya had to be extra careful. Hence he just had him perfect the Odama Rasengan and brush up on tactics (which pays off in the Pain fight).\n\nAt the very least Naruto sort of gained access to Version 2 four tails which nearly kicked Orochimaru's ass. Before the incident I'm pretty sure he got to fully control version 1 three tails too.",

The only canon new gen characters are team 7, team 10, mental Lee and sumire, metal appered for one panel and sumire appered for maybe 3. \n\n>and that\u2019s cool about naruto fillers i guess. but give me one way you can tell me the mitsuki arc is filler other than it\u2019s lack of being in the manga i won\u2019t even try to debate it.\n\nWhy didn't the karma of boruto activated when he fought against the clay people that basically fucked him but it did activated against green choji, I will tell you why because that arc didn't happen and the tento arc happened 3 days after the chunin exams.\n\n>Literally a kage died and you\u2019re telling me it\u2019s filler LOL\n\nHe died in the time skip between the last and boruto lol\n\n>The anime has adapted 3 arcs.\n\nIt adapted the chunin exams and the 3 chapters of the tento mini arc. I don't see any 3rd arc here\n\n>and if you\u2019re hating on boruto cause of the urashiki arc then stop. everyone knows it\u2019s the worst arc but that doesn\u2019t give incentive to trip on the whole show\n\nI am hating on the anime because it doesn't adapt the manga properly and as an anime alone it's total garbage given the amount of nothing that's happening in most of the show, if you are enjoying it then I am happy for you but don't spread misinformation about the events of the show being canonical to the manga.\n\n>If you didn\u2019t wanna wait so long to see manga content Then don\u2019t read the manga or don\u2019t watch the anime \n\nFirst of all your sentence made no sense at all, Second of all I am more of a manga person in general so I don't read because I can't wait I read because it's more enjoyable for me than watching the anime especially for shows like boruto who will never get anywhere.",

After Naruto learned it as a genin in a few days (!), Naruto used the same method to teach Konohamaru, who successfully learned it as a genin.  Konohamaruo taught Boruto the same way, who successfully learned it as a genin.  So a jutsu so difficult that only Minato, Jiraiya, and Kakashi could use it at first, was taught to 3 genins with a 100% success rate using Jiraiya's method.",
