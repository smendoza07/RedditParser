    "body": "I cannot tell you how many times I've been in conversations where a girl says \"my friend goes on dates with an old guy & he gives her $500 just to have dinner with them\".\n\nI try to respectfully say that maybe there's more to that arrangement her friend just doesn't want to tell her about because most men want more than just good looks, and I'm met with \"well why would she lie? She said she doesn't do anything and I believe her\" and \"well paypigs exist so can platonic sugar daddies\" \"men are just lonely and want the ego boost, not sex\".\n\nGod forbid I try to be realistic with people... ok rant over haha Happy Monday everyone!\n\nEDIT: here's my point, as put so eloquently by u/mr_sugarman : \"I think her point is more \"Everyone who says they are doing platonic only\" can't be telling the truth. Versus \"Everyone who says they are doing platonic is lying.\" Two different implications.\"",

            "body": "So here's my story. I'm the old guy. We went on a couple of trust-building dates and sort of got stuck in the friend zone. I was okay with it. For me there was an openness, availability, and a connection. I also genuinely appreciated helping this girl. So 300 500 for a dinner/date became the norm for about a year. But after a while two things happened.\n\nAs is human nature, my SB started to take the relationship for granted. She flaked on some dates, started to pull away, catered to her schedule and not mine, and my personal pet peeve, texted during the date. When she want some money, company or a good meal, she'd call, but things were clearly going in the wrong direction.\n\nOn my part, I began feeling used. I know that she was meeting other men for sex and a lot less money. Began to feel my self-esteem drop a bit.\n\nSo yes, there are Daddys out there who will provide generously for company, conversation, connection, without sex. But the relationship still has to be mutual have some level. We're not stupid, pathetically lonely, or otherwise deficient. We have our own needs, and if they're not met, we will move on. Trust me, there is no shortage of charming, beautiful, intelligent women who do appreciate a nice time and a true demonstration of our appreciation monetarily, given without expectation or condition.",

I even have an online one right now who has already sent me $5,000 over the past few weeks in exchange only for regular, non-sexual yet sort of flirty conversations. After my first experience like this, I used to think these arrangements were only extremely rare and very few people found them, so I felt lucky. However, after my fourth platonic SR I think it\u2019s just something that I, personally, am able to do. My reality may just be slightly different from those who believe it is not possible. I know it is, from experience, but it may just not be possible for certain/most SBs and while most SDs know they could never be that giving, there are men out there who are insanely wealthy and NOT insanely stingy.",

She was new and was super impressed that the very first thing I did was to pay her. Afterwards when we were cuddling in my bed she told me that I was the third SD who she had had a first date with, and the other two had paid her $1000 each to take her to the aquarium, and she hadn't done anything with either one. I bought her a chromebook after the date (my idea, she needed a computer) and she ghosted me as soon as I gave her the amazon locker code. I hadn't told her what was in the locker I just told her that I sent her something.\n\nMy actual date doing something expensive that she likes with actual alone time afterwards maybe didn't live up to her experience of getting paid to walk around in public for a couple hours.",
