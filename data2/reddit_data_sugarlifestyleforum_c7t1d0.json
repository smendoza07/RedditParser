    "body": "My actual background is pretty boring. So, after I tell a POT about myself, I always tell her that I can act like I have a much more interesting personal history, and I give her a list of options of characters I can pretend to be. To be honest, I put a lot of work into this list. I created deep characters with the kind of personal narrative that all women really want from men. Each one has heartwarming tales of overcoming adversity, firetrucks, and tasteful amounts of incest. The options are:\n#\n1. Underwear model (I do all the \"before\" pictures)\n#\n2. Professional, fully licensed horsethief.\n#\n3. Dusty Buns, the donut king\n#\n4. Street chemist (It's not what you think. I made millions selling bath bombs to al-qaeda)\n#\n\nIn the past eleven months, 100% of girls have picked the donut tycoon. Wtf ladies? Was there a meeting? If I have to tell another girl about how I glued two donuts together to create a super donut, I'm going to hurl. I can't believe I'm saying this, but, as a result of the terrible decisions made by otherwise very pleseant women in LA, I have to kill off Dusty Buns. This is on you all, not me. You're making me whack a dude for being too boring, smh.\n#\nFriends, as we celebrate this week, I hope you will join me in raising a glass, to the memory of Mr. Dusty Buns. I knew him well. He wanted to die honorably, the way all men want to go out (mechanical bull riding accident).  But alas, it's much more convenient for me that he died of an instantaneous, spontaneous, and lethal case of diabetes, while trying to chase down an ice cream truck. Ah, Mr. Buns. You will always be remembered as a sweet man. Too many onions cut in here, can't finish. Sniff.",

Who the actual fuck is licensing horsethieves? It goes well beyond straining credulity and breaks it more fully than my high school's prom queen broke my heart when she told me if I was the last man on Earth, she'd find a dog (or chimpanzee) before dating me. At the time, I was too hurt to wonder why she *started* with dog and then used chimpanzee as a backup. But now I'm like, wtf, Lisa. Why go dog before chimpanzee?\n\n>selling bath bombs to al-qaeda\n\nWe're supposed to be thinking sexy thoughts. Even with a genuine Lush Bom Perignon, Al-Qaeda isn't sexy. \n\nThat just leaves Donut Dude. Build better characters if you want women to make better choices.",

The Country bar has amazing tacos and Mexican style bacon wrapped hot dogs.  My kitchen crew st that place owned a very popular food truck before they started running my kitchen.  Some of my old SB\u2019s always want to meet up with me at the bar so they can down 6 tacos while we catch up.  My real estate development business earns much more money but girls don\u2019t get excited talking about Re zoning and use permits.   Weed and Tacos win out every time.  The girls do like to see pretty houses when they are all done.  Several loved to have naughty quickies in a mansion that was for sale.  Fun role playing.",
