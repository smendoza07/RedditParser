I would get comments like \"she is beautiful...for a black girl\", \"she is classy...for a black girl\", \"she is smart and articulate...for a black girl\".  I've been taught (yes, I've learned my lesson!  lol)  to correct them.  I just say ***\"No.  She is a beautiful, classy, intelligent woman!\".***  Occasionally, they would stare at me dumbfounded and say ***\"Isn't that what I said?\".***\n\nI've said this before, but many white men find black women beautiful, but out of ignorance think a black woman wouldn't be attracted to a white man or that all black women are \"ghetto\".   In the US, we are still mostly segregated by where we live, go to school, work and socialize.  There is still a lot of fear of the unknown when it comes to race relations.",

You don\u2019t use that phrase when your expectations of that person are in line with your view of the group. \nI would also say that to bring up the last paragraph of your post, IMO it\u2019s a bit inappropriate for you to comment on someone\u2019s post venting about their struggle in the community, and then turn around to point out struggles of different people. Adding to that, this is not a new issue and instead of dancing around it, I think people should take some time accepting what society is, understanding why it is that way, and moving forward to fix the problem. That\u2019s what you can do as a clearly concerned member of society, which is what we will need to help solve the problem- people asking genuine questions to concepts they don\u2019t understand instead of just going on with their own theory on why they are right and never opening their mind to another idea. So good for you for keeping your mind open and asking questions! \nBut if you needed further answer to your last question, yes there are men who say that and it is still wrong of them to do so. It would be implying there is something wrong with white women, so you stay clear of them. Just because she is a beautiful white woman, doesn\u2019t mean she will disassociate herself from her skin color in any healthy way because of your views about white people. She will still be a white person after your statement just as she was for her entire life before your statement. She is associated with white people by default, so it was a compliment, but at the same time an insult. This applies to everything you can substitute for \u201cwhite woman.\u201d Hope this helps!",

First of all, good for you. However, you are just one person. There are some women who revel in such backhanded compliments, fear not. Now, to the real point, take a hard look at that statement you typed, \"not normally\", so her attraction to you is abnormal to her. That would make you feel good, that knowing your (temporary, probably enhanced by makeup & straightened hair) great looks has enthralled this person who otherwise would not have given you a second chance? Interesting.\n2. \"I've also had discussions with \"minority\" (in the US) women, at their request, about how pussies compared across ethnicities.\"  - Not sure where you were going with this statement but it's disgusting. As if the few women who have had the misfortune to sleep with you are the end all & definitive mold for vaginas of their respective races.\n3. do WOC recognize that there's a whole category of men of all ethnicities who would say \"I'm not normally into white women but you're gorgeous!\"? - Yep, they are not excluded from the category of tactless men. However, again, there are white women who dig those backhanded compliments from men (look at the Kardasshian-Jenner family for instance).",

You don\u2019t use that phrase when your expectations of that person are in line with your view of the group. \nI would also say that to bring up the last paragraph of your post, IMO it\u2019s a bit inappropriate for you to comment on someone\u2019s post venting about their struggle in the community, and then turn around to point out struggles of different people. Adding to that, this is not a new issue and instead of dancing around it, I think people should take some time accepting what society is, understanding why it is that way, and moving forward to fix the problem. That\u2019s what you can do as a clearly concerned member of society, which is what we will need to help solve the problem- people asking genuine questions to concepts they don\u2019t understand instead of just going on with their own theory on why they are right and never opening their mind to another idea. So good for you for keeping your mind open and asking questions! \nBut if you needed further answer to your last question, yes there are men who say that and it is still wrong of them to do so. It would be implying there is something wrong with white women, so you stay clear of them. Just because she is a beautiful white woman, doesn\u2019t mean she will disassociate herself from her skin color in any healthy way because of your views about white people. She will still be a white person after your statement just as she was for her entire life before your statement. She is associated with white people by default, so it was a compliment, but at the same time an insult. This applies to everything you can substitute for \u201cwhite woman.\u201d Hope this helps!",

You really must not have even read my comment. There is no \u201cother side\u201d other than being racist when you say things like that. THATS why they are getting downvoted. Just stop... no one needs to \u201cunderstand the other side.\u201d We DO understand the other side. Which is racist. And I\u2019ll go ahead and add that I am white if that helps you understand anything better, and for some sick reason it probably will.",

There is a lot to unpack in your message.\n\n1. \"I'm not normally into white guys but you're gorgeous.\" Would be a compliment to me. - Oh, I'm not surprised you believe so. First of all, good for you. However, you are just one person. There are some women who revel in such backhanded compliments, fear not. Now, to the real point, take a hard look at that statement you typed, \"not normally\", so her attraction to you is abnormal to her. That would make you feel good, that knowing your (temporary, probably enhanced by makeup & straightened hair) great looks has enthralled this person who otherwise would not have given you a second chance? Interesting.\n2. \"I've also had discussions with \"minority\" (in the US) women, at their request, about how pussies compared across ethnicities.\"  - Not sure where you were going with this statement but it's disgusting. As if the few women who have had the misfortune to sleep with you are the end all & definitive mold for vaginas of their respective races.\n3. do WOC recognize that there's a whole category of men of all ethnicities who would say \"I'm not normally into white women but you're gorgeous!\"? - Yep, they are not excluded from the category of tactless men. However, again, there are white women who dig those backhanded compliments from men (look at the Kardasshian-Jenner family for instance).",
