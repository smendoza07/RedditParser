It's not something you can replicate with a haircut or hair product.\n\nIf you have naturally voluminous, thick, and wavy hair, just growing it long and parting it in the middle will essentially get this look. He has a slight taper from the front to back, but that's just icing on the cake.\n\nHis haircut doesn't affect how his hair flows, or stays in place. \n\nYou could also get this look If you have long, healthy hair, and can spend an hour in a stylist's chair. But that's not really realistic for most of us.",

OP, post this to r/hair and hopefully a licensed cosmetologist can help guide you towards the tools you can use to create this look with your hair type.\n\nOne guy wrote:\n\n>Kurt Russell's haircut works because of the texture and thickness of his hair.
