She fights the war like everyeone else-- thats it. You don't need a deep reason to like someone, and she Just Liked him and grew with him as teammates. \n\nMind, she asks to go along on his journey only 2 or 3 months after the war, so she couldve seen how sane he was and known about Itachi after someone filled her in after the war to.. Its a shonen manga. There won't be deep psychological processing over anything. Curse of hatred leaves=Sasuke is sane is the only logic used there",

And naruto still didnt give up.\n\nAnd if you're talking about even later, Sakura doesn't let her feelings hinder her after the kage summit arc at all. She fights the war like everyeone else-- thats it. You don't need a deep reason to like someone, and she Just Liked him and grew with him as teammates. \n\nMind, she asks to go along on his journey only 2 or 3 months after the war, so she couldve seen how sane he was and known about Itachi after someone filled her in after the war to.. Its a shonen manga. There won't be deep psychological processing over anything. Curse of hatred leaves=Sasuke is sane is the only logic used there",
