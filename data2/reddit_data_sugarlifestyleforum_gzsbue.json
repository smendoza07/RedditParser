    "body": "This topic isn't much fun to talk about but it's a real factor and we need to be aware of it. Many of us are very guilty of breaking the rules here and there but one thing we need to remember is that the rules are there for a reason. Going to a hotel during the first meet is a huge danger. My city has a huge sex trafficking ring that is very well known. How they haven't put a stop to it is crazy but it's so bad that we have a sex trafficking support and action group in area. So let's talk about it. Let's put together guidelines to protect ourselves\n\n1. If you decide to have your first intamate date at a hotel please make sure that you choose the hotel are you could be walking into something sinister \n2. Avoid sex on the first meet, biggest rule broken ever!\n3. Dont go back to the guys house on the first meet very big rule broken again\n4. Keep informed, know what's going on in the area and meet in your area not someone else's \n5. If you don't feel comfortable follow your gut",

You'll often get the feelings around comfort level for things you notice but that do not register. Also, it is more important to be safe than avoiding offense to someone you just met.",

The most common is that you meet someone at a hotel and they tell you you can not leave threaten violence possibly even drug or attack you. Often times they will try to force you to stay st the hotel while they basically pimp you out to other guys to make money.  They sometimes will let you leave the hotel but force you to come meet with them to be pimped out on great of violence to you or your family\nAnother way they sometimes work is that they will operate in a location very to transportation, typically in these cases it is a foreign man who lures you in then they will kidnap you and sell you you to other guys, in these rings you'll be passed around between men who will pimp you out and then sell you to the next man.",

You can also bring it up before the m&g which us less popular but better in the beginning when your getting used to how the bowl works I've started doing this myself to ward off guys who are looking for a hook up without sugar. For instance I told my last pot, hey before our m&g I wanted to get an idea of where your head is st as far as an allowance. He offered a ppm ammount that we agreed on. Payment through PayPal or another app is best besides cash",

They sometimes will let you leave the hotel but force you to come meet with them to be pimped out on great of violence to you or your family\nAnother way they sometimes work is that they will operate in a location very to transportation, typically in these cases it is a foreign man who lures you in then they will kidnap you and sell you you to other guys, in these rings you'll be passed around between men who will pimp you out and then sell you to the next man.",

After the m&g talk to him about your second meeting and wheather hes willing to do an allowance or ppm. Ppm is always the better option at first but if he says allowance make sure its paid before intamacy. You can also bring it up before the m&g which us less popular but better in the beginning when your getting used to how the bowl works I've started doing this myself to ward off guys who are looking for a hook up without sugar. For instance I told my last pot, hey before our m&g I wanted to get an idea of where your head is st as far as an allowance. He offered a ppm ammount that we agreed on. Payment through PayPal or another app is best besides cash",

You can also bring it up before the m&g which us less popular but better in the beginning when your getting used to how the bowl works I've started doing this myself to ward off guys who are looking for a hook up without sugar. For instance I told my last pot, hey before our m&g I wanted to get an idea of where your head is st as far as an allowance. He offered a ppm ammount that we agreed on.
