It's not really an undercut, it's not really a fade, and there's that weird notch just off-center which he could have at least attempted to fix but didn't. I just don't get it.\n\nGood news is that it's fixable, bad news is that it'll mean cutting off more hair. Lesser of two evils--this will look even worse as it grows out. \n\nAvoiding this in the future: 1) make SURE your barber is licensed. Not a guarantee by any means, but it increases the odds that they know what they're doing. 2) Avoid asking for cuts by name. One guy's idea of a\"bald fade\" is different than another's. Have to be honest: if you had asked me for a bald fade, you wouldn't have gotten the cut on the right. Or you might have--I would have asked you some questions about what you meant exactly. 3) Bring a picture. 4)When you find someone who cuts your hair exactly the way you like it, stick with that barber.",
