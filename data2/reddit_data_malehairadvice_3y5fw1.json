You know why?\n\n>'Cause giving male fitness advice ain't our fuckin' business, that's why.\n\nSo quit giving unsolicited advice. I don't care if you think OP is overweight, has horrible acne, or is dadcore to the max. They didn't come here for that advice. There are other subs for that advice. This sub is for **HAIR**. \n\n#**Rule 1 includes giving unsolicited advice**. \n\nTake your FPH bullshit elsewhere. And happy holidays. ",
