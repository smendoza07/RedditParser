                    "body": ">And I guess summoning too.\n\nGood point. Summoning justsu was so essential to Naruto and even more so with Hiruzen's generation and the Sannin. Pretty much boosts you to almost Kage level right away and gave them such a massive leg up on the competition at that time. Hiruzen (Enma) / Danzo (Baku) strongest of their generation and the following Sannin strongest of their generation.\n\nPretty sure the first user was actually the 2nd Mizukage idk how the hell Sarutobi figured it out he's the first Konoha user I know of to use it. I can just imagine an elite Jonin squad seeing Baku appear randomly in the forest during the war and Hiruzen's huge staff coming out of nowhere to crush them. Such a cool jutsu.",

                            "body": "While Summoning is a cool, strong technique, I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s an automatic Kage-level technique. Naruto could barely summon Gamabunta while tapping into the Kyuubi\u2019s chakra, and he was nowhere near Kage-level at the end of Part 1. Most other users, like Temari (weasel things) or Kakashi (dogs) get some supplemental use out of them, but they aren\u2019t broken on their own. Plus, top-tier summons require a lot of chakra, a summoning contract, and the cooperation of the summons involved, which can all be rather tricky. Shinobi who are able to use summons at a high level are usually Jonin-level or higher just due to the experience and effort needed to get there. \n\nNot sure that the first summoner was the 2nd Mizukage either. Madara summoned the Kyuubi for his fight with Hashirama, which happened before the Second Mizukage came to power. Tobirama also invented the Edo Tensei, which summons the dead. If we restrict the criteria to animals only, we can see that there are three names before Jiraiya on the toad summoning contract scroll. As Jiraiya acquired the scroll from the toads himself in his youth, this implies that these three summoners lived some time before him, which might place them before the Second Mizukage\u2019s time. \n\nSummoning is pretty cool though. Wish Konohamaru got more time to shine with the monkey summons, but it is what it is.",

I could be misremembering details there but I think that\u2019s a somewhat fair assumption.\n\nNot sure how it works for the tailed beasts tho, Madara summons kurama which kurama notices but it was kindve unclear if what was genuinely stopping the summoning was naruto\u2019s seal or kurama personal dislike of Madara. Chalk it up to a little bit of column a and a little of column b. Then again there is the matter of Obito summoning kurama, which i assumed implied that you just had to possess strong enough abilities to summon and control him but I can\u2019t off the top of my head whether Obito summoned the 9 tails right out of Kushina or what. \n\nMy headcannon on this particular subject is that Madara first had to control the 9 tails with the sharingan and only then was he able to summon him while he was subdued. Fits better with the defined power of the tailed beasts but also makes sense with how we understand the later summoning via \u201cpartnership\u201d. I don\u2019t know how the 2nd mizu convinced a giant clam to partner with him but I\u2019d be willing to believe he subdued it with his abilities rather than what we see with chief toad, katsuya, manda, etc.",

While Bunta and the other boss summons are strong, they don\u2019t fit very neatly into the normal hierarchy of Genin-Chunin-Jonin-Kage that most shinobi fall into. \n\nGamabunta is very large and very strong, but he moves rather slowly, and lacks the finesse and versatility in his arsenal that we would expect of a Jonin. Naruto and Jiraiya make use of him to equalize fights against other large opponents (other summons / Tailed Beasts), but he struggles more against human-sized enemies that can evade, as seen during the fight with Pain. His skill set is oriented towards large-scale AOE attacks and Tailed Beast-sized enemies, and would be of less use otherwise. \n\nRegarding the Sasuke fight: summoning Gamabunta would have been a bad move on Naruto\u2019s part. The structure of the valley means that Gamabunta will have little room to maneuver, and it\u2019s uncertain if he has the speed to hit Sasuke with an attack. On the other hand, it consumes most of Naruto\u2019s chakra, making it a risky gamble at best. \n\nIn another sense, Naruto\u2019s refusal to go all out and use everything at his disposal could be likened to his refusal to go for the kill against Sasuke, which ended up costing him the fight anyway. On a more meta level, Naruto pulling out a giant toad against Sasuke makes the resulting fight difficult to draw, and robs it of all the parallels that made it an interesting fight to begin with.",

Pretty much boosts you to almost Kage level right away and gave them such a massive leg up on the competition at that time. Hiruzen (Enma) / Danzo (Baku) strongest of their generation and the following Sannin strongest of their generation.\n\nPretty sure the first user was actually the 2nd Mizukage idk how the hell Sarutobi figured it out he's the first Konoha user I know of to use it. I can just imagine an elite Jonin squad seeing Baku appear randomly in the forest during the war and Hiruzen's huge staff coming out of nowhere to crush them. Such a cool jutsu.",

                    "body": "While Summoning is a cool, strong technique, I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s an automatic Kage-level technique. Naruto could barely summon Gamabunta while tapping into the Kyuubi\u2019s chakra, and he was nowhere near Kage-level at the end of Part 1. Most other users, like Temari (weasel things) or Kakashi (dogs) get some supplemental use out of them, but they aren\u2019t broken on their own. Plus, top-tier summons require a lot of chakra, a summoning contract, and the cooperation of the summons involved, which can all be rather tricky. Shinobi who are able to use summons at a high level are usually Jonin-level or higher just due to the experience and effort needed to get there. \n\nNot sure that the first summoner was the 2nd Mizukage either. Madara summoned the Kyuubi for his fight with Hashirama, which happened before the Second Mizukage came to power. Tobirama also invented the Edo Tensei, which summons the dead. If we restrict the criteria to animals only, we can see that there are three names before Jiraiya on the toad summoning contract scroll. As Jiraiya acquired the scroll from the toads himself in his youth, this implies that these three summoners lived some time before him, which might place them before the Second Mizukage\u2019s time. \n\nSummoning is pretty cool though. Wish Konohamaru got more time to shine with the monkey summons, but it is what it is.",

I could be misremembering details there but I think that\u2019s a somewhat fair assumption.\n\nNot sure how it works for the tailed beasts tho, Madara summons kurama which kurama notices but it was kindve unclear if what was genuinely stopping the summoning was naruto\u2019s seal or kurama personal dislike of Madara. Chalk it up to a little bit of column a and a little of column b. Then again there is the matter of Obito summoning kurama, which i assumed implied that you just had to possess strong enough abilities to summon and control him but I can\u2019t off the top of my head whether Obito summoned the 9 tails right out of Kushina or what. \n\nMy headcannon on this particular subject is that Madara first had to control the 9 tails with the sharingan and only then was he able to summon him while he was subdued. Fits better with the defined power of the tailed beasts but also makes sense with how we understand the later summoning via \u201cpartnership\u201d. I don\u2019t know how the 2nd mizu convinced a giant clam to partner with him but I\u2019d be willing to believe he subdued it with his abilities rather than what we see with chief toad, katsuya, manda, etc.",

While Bunta and the other boss summons are strong, they don\u2019t fit very neatly into the normal hierarchy of Genin-Chunin-Jonin-Kage that most shinobi fall into. \n\nGamabunta is very large and very strong, but he moves rather slowly, and lacks the finesse and versatility in his arsenal that we would expect of a Jonin. Naruto and Jiraiya make use of him to equalize fights against other large opponents (other summons / Tailed Beasts), but he struggles more against human-sized enemies that can evade, as seen during the fight with Pain. His skill set is oriented towards large-scale AOE attacks and Tailed Beast-sized enemies, and would be of less use otherwise. \n\nRegarding the Sasuke fight: summoning Gamabunta would have been a bad move on Naruto\u2019s part. The structure of the valley means that Gamabunta will have little room to maneuver, and it\u2019s uncertain if he has the speed to hit Sasuke with an attack. On the other hand, it consumes most of Naruto\u2019s chakra, making it a risky gamble at best. \n\nIn another sense, Naruto\u2019s refusal to go all out and use everything at his disposal could be likened to his refusal to go for the kill against Sasuke, which ended up costing him the fight anyway. On a more meta level, Naruto pulling out a giant toad against Sasuke makes the resulting fight difficult to draw, and robs it of all the parallels that made it an interesting fight to begin with.",

            "body": "While Summoning is a cool, strong technique, I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s an automatic Kage-level technique. Naruto could barely summon Gamabunta while tapping into the Kyuubi\u2019s chakra, and he was nowhere near Kage-level at the end of Part 1. Most other users, like Temari (weasel things) or Kakashi (dogs) get some supplemental use out of them, but they aren\u2019t broken on their own. Plus, top-tier summons require a lot of chakra, a summoning contract, and the cooperation of the summons involved, which can all be rather tricky. Shinobi who are able to use summons at a high level are usually Jonin-level or higher just due to the experience and effort needed to get there. \n\nNot sure that the first summoner was the 2nd Mizukage either. Madara summoned the Kyuubi for his fight with Hashirama, which happened before the Second Mizukage came to power. Tobirama also invented the Edo Tensei, which summons the dead. If we restrict the criteria to animals only, we can see that there are three names before Jiraiya on the toad summoning contract scroll. As Jiraiya acquired the scroll from the toads himself in his youth, this implies that these three summoners lived some time before him, which might place them before the Second Mizukage\u2019s time. \n\nSummoning is pretty cool though. Wish Konohamaru got more time to shine with the monkey summons, but it is what it is.",

I could be misremembering details there but I think that\u2019s a somewhat fair assumption.\n\nNot sure how it works for the tailed beasts tho, Madara summons kurama which kurama notices but it was kindve unclear if what was genuinely stopping the summoning was naruto\u2019s seal or kurama personal dislike of Madara. Chalk it up to a little bit of column a and a little of column b. Then again there is the matter of Obito summoning kurama, which i assumed implied that you just had to possess strong enough abilities to summon and control him but I can\u2019t off the top of my head whether Obito summoned the 9 tails right out of Kushina or what. \n\nMy headcannon on this particular subject is that Madara first had to control the 9 tails with the sharingan and only then was he able to summon him while he was subdued. Fits better with the defined power of the tailed beasts but also makes sense with how we understand the later summoning via \u201cpartnership\u201d. I don\u2019t know how the 2nd mizu convinced a giant clam to partner with him but I\u2019d be willing to believe he subdued it with his abilities rather than what we see with chief toad, katsuya, manda, etc.",

While Bunta and the other boss summons are strong, they don\u2019t fit very neatly into the normal hierarchy of Genin-Chunin-Jonin-Kage that most shinobi fall into. \n\nGamabunta is very large and very strong, but he moves rather slowly, and lacks the finesse and versatility in his arsenal that we would expect of a Jonin. Naruto and Jiraiya make use of him to equalize fights against other large opponents (other summons / Tailed Beasts), but he struggles more against human-sized enemies that can evade, as seen during the fight with Pain. His skill set is oriented towards large-scale AOE attacks and Tailed Beast-sized enemies, and would be of less use otherwise. \n\nRegarding the Sasuke fight: summoning Gamabunta would have been a bad move on Naruto\u2019s part. The structure of the valley means that Gamabunta will have little room to maneuver, and it\u2019s uncertain if he has the speed to hit Sasuke with an attack. On the other hand, it consumes most of Naruto\u2019s chakra, making it a risky gamble at best. \n\nIn another sense, Naruto\u2019s refusal to go all out and use everything at his disposal could be likened to his refusal to go for the kill against Sasuke, which ended up costing him the fight anyway. On a more meta level, Naruto pulling out a giant toad against Sasuke makes the resulting fight difficult to draw, and robs it of all the parallels that made it an interesting fight to begin with.",

I could be misremembering details there but I think that\u2019s a somewhat fair assumption.\n\nNot sure how it works for the tailed beasts tho, Madara summons kurama which kurama notices but it was kindve unclear if what was genuinely stopping the summoning was naruto\u2019s seal or kurama personal dislike of Madara. Chalk it up to a little bit of column a and a little of column b. Then again there is the matter of Obito summoning kurama, which i assumed implied that you just had to possess strong enough abilities to summon and control him but I can\u2019t off the top of my head whether Obito summoned the 9 tails right out of Kushina or what. \n\nMy headcannon on this particular subject is that Madara first had to control the 9 tails with the sharingan and only then was he able to summon him while he was subdued. Fits better with the defined power of the tailed beasts but also makes sense with how we understand the later summoning via \u201cpartnership\u201d. I don\u2019t know how the 2nd mizu convinced a giant clam to partner with him but I\u2019d be willing to believe he subdued it with his abilities rather than what we see with chief toad, katsuya, manda, etc.",

While Bunta and the other boss summons are strong, they don\u2019t fit very neatly into the normal hierarchy of Genin-Chunin-Jonin-Kage that most shinobi fall into. \n\nGamabunta is very large and very strong, but he moves rather slowly, and lacks the finesse and versatility in his arsenal that we would expect of a Jonin. Naruto and Jiraiya make use of him to equalize fights against other large opponents (other summons / Tailed Beasts), but he struggles more against human-sized enemies that can evade, as seen during the fight with Pain. His skill set is oriented towards large-scale AOE attacks and Tailed Beast-sized enemies, and would be of less use otherwise. \n\nRegarding the Sasuke fight: summoning Gamabunta would have been a bad move on Naruto\u2019s part. The structure of the valley means that Gamabunta will have little room to maneuver, and it\u2019s uncertain if he has the speed to hit Sasuke with an attack. On the other hand, it consumes most of Naruto\u2019s chakra, making it a risky gamble at best. \n\nIn another sense, Naruto\u2019s refusal to go all out and use everything at his disposal could be likened to his refusal to go for the kill against Sasuke, which ended up costing him the fight anyway. On a more meta level, Naruto pulling out a giant toad against Sasuke makes the resulting fight difficult to draw, and robs it of all the parallels that made it an interesting fight to begin with.",

While Bunta and the other boss summons are strong, they don\u2019t fit very neatly into the normal hierarchy of Genin-Chunin-Jonin-Kage that most shinobi fall into. \n\nGamabunta is very large and very strong, but he moves rather slowly, and lacks the finesse and versatility in his arsenal that we would expect of a Jonin. Naruto and Jiraiya make use of him to equalize fights against other large opponents (other summons / Tailed Beasts), but he struggles more against human-sized enemies that can evade, as seen during the fight with Pain. His skill set is oriented towards large-scale AOE attacks and Tailed Beast-sized enemies, and would be of less use otherwise. \n\nRegarding the Sasuke fight: summoning Gamabunta would have been a bad move on Naruto\u2019s part. The structure of the valley means that Gamabunta will have little room to maneuver, and it\u2019s uncertain if he has the speed to hit Sasuke with an attack. On the other hand, it consumes most of Naruto\u2019s chakra, making it a risky gamble at best. \n\nIn another sense, Naruto\u2019s refusal to go all out and use everything at his disposal could be likened to his refusal to go for the kill against Sasuke, which ended up costing him the fight anyway. On a more meta level, Naruto pulling out a giant toad against Sasuke makes the resulting fight difficult to draw, and robs it of all the parallels that made it an interesting fight to begin with.",
