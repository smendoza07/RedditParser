                    "body": "Not to hijack a positive thread, but I have many theories as to why. First off, it isn't their fans only. In fact, I would confidently say it was very one-sided at the height of it as someone who has joined this show late and seen it all at the same time (not in real time unfolding) and if you go back to the older hate comments, it is never directed towards SJH. In addition, generalizing an entire fandom as toxic and hateful is unfair. I myself am a fan of JSM in that I not only love seeing her in RM, but I also actively watch her other work, but I don't dislike SJH at all. In fact, I actively watched her show (Witch's Diner, mainly for her after seeing the cast on RM). \n\nThe early hate was directed towards JSM because people have a hard time adjusting to change. It is also, and this might not be totally PC to say, generally the case with most k-fandoms (not meaning Koreans, but fans of Korean content) that they are mostly very passionate and sadly misguided in where they direct this passion. Instead of focusing on screaming under the social media posts to get JSM and YSC out, calling her all sorts of names for playing a character, etc.; they should have focused on encouraging their favorites move on from a bad experience and asking for more interesting plots and character developments for her. \n\nEven going back to 5 years ago, many of the comments liked Mongdol sisters, but it stopped with that Mongolia trip. The production must have known the situation, and they must have been worried of even more backlash, but they failed to realize that one way to move away from that would be to push for a better screen chemistry with these women. This would have helped SJH as well, because she naturally has that tender and caring older sister vibe about her, as we have seen with most of the female guests on the show. I believe the show was at a very tough spot and they didn't want to take the risk, but it would have paid off had they done it, based solely on the things I have seen regarding Mongdol. \n\nBack to the hate; it mostly came from three groups: A very vocal and dedicated groups that were fans of the previous member who left, fans of KJK and SJH, and most viscious, fans of SJH. Please add the phrase: \"the toxic portion of\" before each. I have seen comments that truly made me uncomfortable, and not because of JSM, but because of SJH! Getting hate isn't a new thing, because I have grown up on the internet and have seen it happen many times. But I don't think I have ever seen a fandom worshiping, protecting, spoiling for a lack of a better word, obsessing with and worst of all wanting to control their favorite. Poor JSM proved to be an easy target because she was inexperienced, the only other female on the cast, young, and not well known. \n\nI saw comments saying they were angry about another woman joining the show because that meant, and I quote (please, these are not my words): \"SJH would no longer be the only princess of her oppas.\" ! This is so unhinged and borderline creepy, If I were SJH I would be scared for my safety. To have such obsessive fans that think of her like this, attack anyone who looks at her wrong, anyone who they think is coming between her love-line on the show, anyone who dresses and styles her (they actually demanded her stylist be fired because of her haircut.), etc. Somehow, seeing this behavior towards 19 year old K-pop idols is not as bad, because I can imagine the fans are mostly 10-13 year olds and don't think of these idols as human beings, because they can't understand the complexity of this kind of job. \n\nBut to be treated like this by a large portion of your fans as a 40-something year old woman is just awful. I don't think people have ever stopped to think how this made SJH feel and look. I have never been part of a fandom, so I am not sure if this sort of cult worship and obsessive protection is routine, but it definitely isn't normal. What is worse is the way the show has handled it, by mostly if not always giving into it. For example, JSJ posted a picture without SJH in it on his instagram and received so much backlash from her fans for not including her that he edited his caption, in English, to clear things up saying the pictures were taken on a day where she was late to work. That didn't fix things, so both him and SJH apologized for that and then JSJ posted a separate picture just with her. \n\nThis is similar to the worst parenting mistakes: Having a child who throws tantrums when you say no to them, so instead of standing your ground, explaining your reasoning as the adult in the relationship, you give into them just to silence them. Then when they become a teenager and expect you as the parent to provide for them for their entire life, you don't get to nag about this. You allowed it to get this bad! \n\nThen it went on and on, and JSM also started to gain fans and those people got angry with the unfair hate and again, instead of ignoring it and/or focusing on highlighting all the good things about JSM and hyping her up, some of these fans started attacking SJH to \"level the playing field\" so to speak. \n\nSorry for the rant. Just really don't think it is fair to first, generalize both fandoms and second, blame it all on the fans.",

I can say, however, that if it were me and I was a new employee who was getting that massive amount of hate thrown at me because of someone else, I would expect that person to step up and stop it and if they didn't, I would think maybe they believed I deserve that! So I really hope that wasn't what happened, because nobody deserves that. Especially not someone as hard working and talented as JSM.\n\nI never considered this to be the reason they have non-existence chemistry, but now that you mention it, it is probable. Still, a large part of it is separating them in teams when they could have pushed them into a sibling relationship early on and solidified it. That also could have helped SJH feeling more for JSM, and maybe even putting a stop on the hate/discouraging the hate/condemning the hate. Who knows? The truth is that just didn't happen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Same for the other members, they were quick to defend SJH and her haircut and said something about it on the show but I don't recall that happening for JSM who was going through WAYYYYY worse.\n\nI have never been a fan of how they handle these to be honest. Some might say the show is purely entertainment and including such heavy and negative topics isn't suited, which is true. They fact that they felt like they could joke about SJH's stylist or hair means it wasn't too bad, but how would you joke about JSM receiving death threats and being called vulgar names by SJH's toxic fans? It's better to not mention it rather than joke about it, because it really isn't a laughing matter.\n\nBut that is all in the past and they can't change how they handled it before. Thankfully, I see mostly positive comments on JSM's instagram posts and many acknowledge how good she is at her job. That is the best revenge in my book: Be so good they can't bring you down. At this point, those haters just look delusional, sad and pathetic. I hope we can move on from this and instead focus on having more MongDol moments on the show, because this is one of the most criminally underrated and under-represented relationship on the show.",

            "body": "Not to hijack a positive thread, but I have many theories as to why. First off, it isn't their fans only. In fact, I would confidently say it was very one-sided at the height of it as someone who has joined this show late and seen it all at the same time (not in real time unfolding) and if you go back to the older hate comments, it is never directed towards SJH. In addition, generalizing an entire fandom as toxic and hateful is unfair. I myself am a fan of JSM in that I not only love seeing her in RM, but I also actively watch her other work, but I don't dislike SJH at all. In fact, I actively watched her show (Witch's Diner, mainly for her after seeing the cast on RM). \n\nThe early hate was directed towards JSM because people have a hard time adjusting to change. It is also, and this might not be totally PC to say, generally the case with most k-fandoms (not meaning Koreans, but fans of Korean content) that they are mostly very passionate and sadly misguided in where they direct this passion. Instead of focusing on screaming under the social media posts to get JSM and YSC out, calling her all sorts of names for playing a character, etc.; they should have focused on encouraging their favorites move on from a bad experience and asking for more interesting plots and character developments for her. \n\nEven going back to 5 years ago, many of the comments liked Mongdol sisters, but it stopped with that Mongolia trip. The production must have known the situation, and they must have been worried of even more backlash, but they failed to realize that one way to move away from that would be to push for a better screen chemistry with these women. This would have helped SJH as well, because she naturally has that tender and caring older sister vibe about her, as we have seen with most of the female guests on the show. I believe the show was at a very tough spot and they didn't want to take the risk, but it would have paid off had they done it, based solely on the things I have seen regarding Mongdol. \n\nBack to the hate; it mostly came from three groups: A very vocal and dedicated groups that were fans of the previous member who left, fans of KJK and SJH, and most viscious, fans of SJH. Please add the phrase: \"the toxic portion of\" before each. I have seen comments that truly made me uncomfortable, and not because of JSM, but because of SJH! Getting hate isn't a new thing, because I have grown up on the internet and have seen it happen many times. But I don't think I have ever seen a fandom worshiping, protecting, spoiling for a lack of a better word, obsessing with and worst of all wanting to control their favorite. Poor JSM proved to be an easy target because she was inexperienced, the only other female on the cast, young, and not well known. \n\nI saw comments saying they were angry about another woman joining the show because that meant, and I quote (please, these are not my words): \"SJH would no longer be the only princess of her oppas.\" ! This is so unhinged and borderline creepy, If I were SJH I would be scared for my safety. To have such obsessive fans that think of her like this, attack anyone who looks at her wrong, anyone who they think is coming between her love-line on the show, anyone who dresses and styles her (they actually demanded her stylist be fired because of her haircut.), etc. Somehow, seeing this behavior towards 19 year old K-pop idols is not as bad, because I can imagine the fans are mostly 10-13 year olds and don't think of these idols as human beings, because they can't understand the complexity of this kind of job. \n\nBut to be treated like this by a large portion of your fans as a 40-something year old woman is just awful. I don't think people have ever stopped to think how this made SJH feel and look. I have never been part of a fandom, so I am not sure if this sort of cult worship and obsessive protection is routine, but it definitely isn't normal. What is worse is the way the show has handled it, by mostly if not always giving into it. For example, JSJ posted a picture without SJH in it on his instagram and received so much backlash from her fans for not including her that he edited his caption, in English, to clear things up saying the pictures were taken on a day where she was late to work. That didn't fix things, so both him and SJH apologized for that and then JSJ posted a separate picture just with her. \n\nThis is similar to the worst parenting mistakes: Having a child who throws tantrums when you say no to them, so instead of standing your ground, explaining your reasoning as the adult in the relationship, you give into them just to silence them. Then when they become a teenager and expect you as the parent to provide for them for their entire life, you don't get to nag about this. You allowed it to get this bad! \n\nThen it went on and on, and JSM also started to gain fans and those people got angry with the unfair hate and again, instead of ignoring it and/or focusing on highlighting all the good things about JSM and hyping her up, some of these fans started attacking SJH to \"level the playing field\" so to speak. \n\nSorry for the rant. Just really don't think it is fair to first, generalize both fandoms and second, blame it all on the fans.",

I can say, however, that if it were me and I was a new employee who was getting that massive amount of hate thrown at me because of someone else, I would expect that person to step up and stop it and if they didn't, I would think maybe they believed I deserve that! So I really hope that wasn't what happened, because nobody deserves that. Especially not someone as hard working and talented as JSM.\n\nI never considered this to be the reason they have non-existence chemistry, but now that you mention it, it is probable. Still, a large part of it is separating them in teams when they could have pushed them into a sibling relationship early on and solidified it. That also could have helped SJH feeling more for JSM, and maybe even putting a stop on the hate/discouraging the hate/condemning the hate. Who knows? The truth is that just didn't happen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Same for the other members, they were quick to defend SJH and her haircut and said something about it on the show but I don't recall that happening for JSM who was going through WAYYYYY worse.\n\nI have never been a fan of how they handle these to be honest. Some might say the show is purely entertainment and including such heavy and negative topics isn't suited, which is true. They fact that they felt like they could joke about SJH's stylist or hair means it wasn't too bad, but how would you joke about JSM receiving death threats and being called vulgar names by SJH's toxic fans? It's better to not mention it rather than joke about it, because it really isn't a laughing matter.\n\nBut that is all in the past and they can't change how they handled it before. Thankfully, I see mostly positive comments on JSM's instagram posts and many acknowledge how good she is at her job. That is the best revenge in my book: Be so good they can't bring you down. At this point, those haters just look delusional, sad and pathetic. I hope we can move on from this and instead focus on having more MongDol moments on the show, because this is one of the most criminally underrated and under-represented relationship on the show.",
