So not only are we conditioning ourselves to think hair is youthful and attractive, we\u2019re also dreading the inevitable.\n\nSo we hang on for too long and end up looking way worse than we would just shaving it. That\u2019s why people sometimes post a pic asking whether or not they\u2019re balding and if they need to shave when everyone else CLEARLY sees they\u2019re balding.\n\nJust my two cents.",

So not only are we conditioning ourselves to think hair is youthful and attractive, we\u2019re also dreading the inevitable.\n\nSo we hang on for too long and end up looking way worse than we would just shaving it. That\u2019s why people sometimes post a pic asking whether or not they\u2019re balding and if they need to shave when everyone else CLEARLY sees they\u2019re balding.\n\nJust my two cents.",
