There are some 50-year old women that I am very very attracted to physically and for other reasons, and those women are fairly rare.  However, the chances of that woman being a SB seem quite low to me, so not sure how helpful that very wide age range is.  Also, the older women has far less interest in an SR due to her age as she likely has more wealth and less need.  There is a floor on younger age reflecting maturity and/or legal reasons.  Realistically, it would be hard for me to find a 21 year old that I find mature enough to connect with outside of intimacy.  An even shorter answer (with no explanation needed) is 24 to 35 years of age.",

There are some 50-year old women that I am very very attracted to physically and for other reasons, and those women are fairly rare.  However, the chances of that woman being a SB seem quite low to me, so not sure how helpful that very wide age range is.  Also, the older women has far less interest in an SR due to her age as she likely has more wealth and less need.  There is a floor on younger age reflecting maturity and/or legal reasons.  Realistically, it would be hard for me to find a 21 year old that I find mature enough to connect with outside of intimacy.  An even shorter answer (with no explanation needed) is 24 to 35 years of age.",

There are some 50-year old women that I am very very attracted to physically and for other reasons, and those women are fairly rare.  However, the chances of that woman being a SB seem quite low to me, so not sure how helpful that very wide age range is.  Also, the older women has far less interest in an SR due to her age as she likely has more wealth and less need.  There is a floor on younger age reflecting maturity and/or legal reasons.  Realistically, it would be hard for me to find a 21 year old that I find mature enough to connect with outside of intimacy.  An even shorter answer (with no explanation needed) is 24 to 35 years of age.",
