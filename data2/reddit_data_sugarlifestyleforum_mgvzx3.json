    "body": "I just had a M&G with a pontienial SD. After having some decent chats we agreed meeting at a park. 20 minutes before the m&g he asks me to meet him at his apartment and I declined. I felt more comfortable meeting at the park first. He comes on time and we are having small talk for most of it. After we both get comfortable with each other I bring up arrangements. I just asked if he has had any prior arrangements and etc. He answers them quickly and basically runs away after that. He says he has work to finish and gtfo. I'm not sure if this has happened to anyone but I got a good laugh out of it.\n\n\nUpdate: This guy may have saved my life LOL. If I didn't meet him I would have gone home my usual time. Some guys were on a shooting spree on my block around the time I walk home. If I didn't meet the road runner I would have been entangled in the shooting!",
