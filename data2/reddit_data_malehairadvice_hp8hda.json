The look will take a lot of effort to get into that position though, and won't hold for long, so invest in some strong hairspray if you're looking to keep it that way. If you don't like it either pushed over, back, or down as a fringe though, I'd recommend looking for something shorter on top that will hold up better with just some matte look product",

If you want the forwards style with the slight spikes that'll work fine if the strands are a bit shorter. The longer the hair is the more it wants to flop down so it's hard to actually the look in the photo consistently. But doable if the hair was a bit shorter on top.\n\nThis is a variant of a very common hairstyle and your barber will know how to do it. Even if you don't currently have the length on top you can just ask for a \"short on the sides, longer on top\" and show them this picture. Then when the sides are getting long after a month or two then you can have them done again but leaving the top to grow out to the length you want.",

Even if you don't currently have the length on top you can just ask for a \"short on the sides, longer on top\" and show them this picture.
