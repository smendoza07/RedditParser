It looks just a bit too thin and choppy, and the fact that your front/middle is thinner becomes more apparent. Try a side part as noted elsewhere in the thread or trim it even shorter.\n\nThis is going to sound weird, but you have a good head. With the stockier build, keep your hair short or even consider being a baldy.\n\nEDIT: Ditto on the sideburns! I thought they looked really good in your 'before' photos!",

This is the result I got when asking for a fade with 3/4\" left on top, and my wife is pleasantly surprised with how it turned out so that's a plus!\n\nJust thought I should update and see any feedback, thanks again!",

You can go even shorter (if not all the way bald, you could try a #2 or #1 guard) and see how that suits you, or grow it a little more and get a side part.\n\nIn fact, if you wanted to experiment, start with the #2 all over and see how that looks. Then if you think shorter, do it again right there with the #1, and then if you want, again down to the skin.\n\nI think in either case you need to let your sideburns come down just a bit (like 1 cm). Sideburns actually help frame your eyes and your face. Right now the higher cut on the sideburns kiiinda looks like a small accident with the clippers IMHO.\n\nThis doesn't mean they have to grow long. You can keep the hair length very short, but still present/visible.\n\nI like that you've got the guts to take some chances and find something that works for you.",
