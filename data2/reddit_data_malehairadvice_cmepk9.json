I'm glad you're pleased.\n\nI think the youthfulness comes from the hair being fuller since it's not pulled tight into a ponytail, and also the beard looks slimmer since it's less squared off.\n\nI think you could go shorter with the beard if desired, but it might be a good idea to experiment with squaring it more. I notice some talk about chinline; I have no idea what yours is (obviously, it's covered), but with your beard fullness you can pretty much \"make up\" any chin/jawline you want and cut to around that length and comb your beard inwards, which is pretty cool.\n\nAgain, both good, you're pretty photogenic, your eyes and hair color are a nice combo.",

I'm glad you're pleased.\n\nI think the youthfulness comes from the hair being fuller since it's not pulled tight into a ponytail, and also the beard looks slimmer since it's less squared off.\n\nI think you could go shorter with the beard if desired, but it might be a good idea to experiment with squaring it more. I notice some talk about chinline; I have no idea what yours is (obviously, it's covered), but with your beard fullness you can pretty much \"make up\" any chin/jawline you want and cut to around that length and comb your beard inwards, which is pretty cool.\n\nAgain, both good, you're pretty photogenic, your eyes and hair color are a nice combo.",
