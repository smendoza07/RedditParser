That goes for almost every character in Boruto. Compare that with Naruto and how he looks compared with Minato and Kushina. He looks and feels like their child, similar but not identical, and with a unique name and powers. For Boruto, as the name implies, most of them are completely non unique. They have a copy paste of their parents looks, names and personalities. The ones you like you will probably like again.",

If you watch boruto you will see he mostly uses gale palm and thunder clap arrow . He uses shadow clone but he doesn\u2019t spam in like naruto, he uses it for supporting ninjutsu like boruto stream or water style wave surge + lightning style combo. He uses rasengan but it\u2019s mainly to finish off opponents. That\u2019s why There are only like 7 minutes of boruto rasengan scenes even though there are like 206 episodes",

He uses rasengan but it\u2019s mainly to finish off opponents. That\u2019s why There are only like 7 minutes of boruto rasengan scenes even though there are like 206 episodes",

And the worst of all is when Naruto and Sasuke get hit even though they are basically gods at this point. I have a hard time believing Sasuke is always out of chakra when he could easily control all the bijuu\u2019s simultaneously after days of battle, or that Naruto would be incapable of just using clones to do his work as hokage.",

And the worst of all is when Naruto and Sasuke get hit even though they are basically gods at this point. I have a hard time believing Sasuke is always out of chakra when he could easily control all the bijuu\u2019s simultaneously after days of battle, or that Naruto would be incapable of just using clones to do his work as hokage.",

And the worst of all is when Naruto and Sasuke get hit even though they are basically gods at this point. I have a hard time believing Sasuke is always out of chakra when he could easily control all the bijuu\u2019s simultaneously after days of battle, or that Naruto would be incapable of just using clones to do his work as hokage.",

And the worst of all is when Naruto and Sasuke get hit even though they are basically gods at this point. I have a hard time believing Sasuke is always out of chakra when he could easily control all the bijuu\u2019s simultaneously after days of battle, or that Naruto would be incapable of just using clones to do his work as hokage.",

And the worst of all is when Naruto and Sasuke get hit even though they are basically gods at this point. I have a hard time believing Sasuke is always out of chakra when he could easily control all the bijuu\u2019s simultaneously after days of battle, or that Naruto would be incapable of just using clones to do his work as hokage.",
