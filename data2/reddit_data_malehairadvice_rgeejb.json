The beard with the contrast of the skin fade looks great imo and then contrasted with the long soft hair on top, is a killer combo. A lot of people are saying you have a great jawline so don\u2019t hide it but 1) your pics are of your side profile with your head also tilted to the side which gives the perspective that your jawline is  sharper and longer than it might actually be - better pics with normal positioning are needed to make that decision, and 2) a beard can also be used to accentuate the jawline so with some nice trimming and grooming you\u2019ll look even sharper",
