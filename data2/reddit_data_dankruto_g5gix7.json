But the thing is, Naruto is such a dense world thick with lore and potential, so it's unavoidably going to be super long, and it should be. So i think the manga is them just trying to get to the point and cut out the fluff, where the anime is the story they actually want to tell.

Nothing against Tsunade love her as well but she should have died as well during the Pain Arc when she spent her chakra to save civilian lives and during the War arc when she fought against Madara alongside the rest of the Kage.

She gets no focus, it's the shonen curse of being a female even though she's an Uchiha. \n\nFirst of all her design is terrible and the artist is a pedophile. She looks like a hoe in thay short skirt. And being a female she's put in stupid love situations instead of being shown to train.. Like they had a scene of her biting her glasses.. Instead of those scenes they could've just shown her traning for chidori and her 3T sharingan or even a backlash.. While boruto and kawaki are shown to train and get new powerups and whatnot.",

But the thing is, Naruto is such a dense world thick with lore and potential, so it's unavoidably going to be super long, and it should be. So i think the manga is them just trying to get to the point and cut out the fluff, where the anime is the story they actually want to tell.

She gets no focus, it's the shonen curse of being a female even though she's an Uchiha. \n\nFirst of all her design is terrible and the artist is a pedophile. She looks like a hoe in thay short skirt. And being a female she's put in stupid love situations instead of being shown to train.. Like they had a scene of her biting her glasses.. Instead of those scenes they could've just shown her traning for chidori and her 3T sharingan or even a backlash.. While boruto and kawaki are shown to train and get new powerups and whatnot.",

But the thing is, Naruto is such a dense world thick with lore and potential, so it's unavoidably going to be super long, and it should be. So i think the manga is them just trying to get to the point and cut out the fluff, where the anime is the story they actually want to tell.

She gets no focus, it's the shonen curse of being a female even though she's an Uchiha. \n\nFirst of all her design is terrible and the artist is a pedophile. She looks like a hoe in thay short skirt. And being a female she's put in stupid love situations instead of being shown to train.. Like they had a scene of her biting her glasses.. Instead of those scenes they could've just shown her traning for chidori and her 3T sharingan or even a backlash.. While boruto and kawaki are shown to train and get new powerups and whatnot.",

Kishimoto's original design for her was so good :/\n\nI think they've found themselves in a weird position with the manga. They went into this not wanting it to be super long i think. But the thing is, Naruto is such a dense world thick with lore and potential, so it's unavoidably going to be super long, and it should be. So i think the manga is them just trying to get to the point and cut out the fluff, where the anime is the story they actually want to tell. But honestly it just comes across as super confusing, because i don't know what i should be reading/watching and what's canon and what isn't.",

The reincarnation of a demigod froze up to two assholes with a chain.

She gets no focus, it's the shonen curse of being a female even though she's an Uchiha. \n\nFirst of all her design is terrible and the artist is a pedophile. She looks like a hoe in thay short skirt. And being a female she's put in stupid love situations instead of being shown to train.. Like they had a scene of her biting her glasses.. Instead of those scenes they could've just shown her traning for chidori and her 3T sharingan or even a backlash.. While boruto and kawaki are shown to train and get new powerups and whatnot.",

But the thing is, Naruto is such a dense world thick with lore and potential, so it's unavoidably going to be super long, and it should be. So i think the manga is them just trying to get to the point and cut out the fluff, where the anime is the story they actually want to tell. But honestly it just comes across as super confusing, because i don't know what i should be reading/watching and what's canon and what isn't.",

But the thing is, Naruto is such a dense world thick with lore and potential, so it's unavoidably going to be super long, and it should be. So i think the manga is them just trying to get to the point and cut out the fluff, where the anime is the story they actually want to tell. But honestly it just comes across as super confusing, because i don't know what i should be reading/watching and what's canon and what isn't.",

Kishimoto's original design for her was so good :/\n\nI think they've found themselves in a weird position with the manga. They went into this not wanting it to be super long i think. But the thing is, Naruto is such a dense world thick with lore and potential, so it's unavoidably going to be super long, and it should be. So i think the manga is them just trying to get to the point and cut out the fluff, where the anime is the story they actually want to tell. But honestly it just comes across as super confusing, because i don't know what i should be reading/watching and what's canon and what isn't.",
