In October 1954, the [U.S. Post Office Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Post_Office_Department)  declared the magazine \"obscene\" and refused to deliver it. ONE, Inc.  brought a lawsuit in federal court, which it won in 1958, when the U.S.  Supreme Court reversed the lower court ruling in [*One, Inc. v. Olesen*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One,_Inc._v._Olesen) based on its recent landmark [First Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) case, [*Roth v. United States*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roth_v._United_States).[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ONE,_Inc.#cite_note-6) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://one.usc.edu/archive-location/one-magazine](https://one.usc.edu/archive-location/one-magazine)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> *ONE Magazine*\u00a0was a nationally-distributed publication put out  by ONE, Incorported, a homophile organization based in Los Angeles. The  magazine was published from 1952 to 1967, surviving threats from the  police and federal government to provide news, essays, fiction, and more  to gay and lesbians across the United States. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBoth the efforts of police and government agencies to shut down one of the first magazines aimed at a gay audience, and the actions of the U.S. Supreme Court to protect the magazine from government suppression, give insights into that era of history (IMHO).",

Maybe following food sources and temperate climates, but id like to think they were just adventurous spirits who had the same innate need to explore the unknown as we do.",

Maybe following food sources and temperate climates, but id like to think they were just adventurous spirits who had the same innate need to explore the unknown as we do.",

So crazy. So when you think about how, for instance clovis points (flint knapped weaponry if thats not common knowledge lol) made it all the way from France to Chile is traceable, it blows my mind.  Like people without knowing anything just took off and explored. Maybe following food sources and temperate climates, but id like to think they were just adventurous spirits who had the same innate need to explore the unknown as we do.",
