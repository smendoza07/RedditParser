    "body": "My SB and I are headed out on one of her very first trips away from our tropical island home.  \n\nShe uses me as a bank; has me hold some money because she says she doesn\u2019t have the discipline not to spend it on car stuff.  So I asked her whether she wanted me to make a \u201cdeposit\u201d into her account or give her cash.  She was confused and asked me what she was getting a gift for.  I told her it was for the trip.  She goes:\n\n\u201cI thought the trip was the gift\u201d\n\nSo sweet to know that she sees a vacation with me as it\u2019s own reward.  Although she may just be smart - now she\u2019s not only going to get a financial boost, but a whole bunch of other gifts just because I\u2019m now in an extremely generous mood.  I got her her first ever winter coat today and I have a feeling that\u2019s just a start!\n\nUpdate:  Im so happy!",
