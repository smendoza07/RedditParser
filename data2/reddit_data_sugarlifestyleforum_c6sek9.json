    "body": "I thought I\u2019d give my take from a sb perspective. I\u2019m aware this may not work with every SR relationship, but try it out and see how it plays out. \n\nBe with someone you genuinely like and attracted to. Trust me, it\u2019ll eventually show if you\u2019re only in it for the $$. Only try these tips when you have some type of genuine attraction to your SD. Its much easier to do and you won\u2019t be faking it, which will speak volumes.\n\n1. Check up on him. My SD and I text quite often but sometimes we\u2019ll go 3-5 days without talking to each other. A simple \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about you lately, how\u2019s this week treating you?\u201d will make him feel good, make him feel wanted. \n\n2. Do things occasionally without asking for anything in return. He will see these nice gestures and reciprocate the generosity.\n\n3. Compliment him. Genuine compliments. Don\u2019t lie. \n\n4. Relax him/cuddle after sex! Give him a massage or lay on his chest, play with his hair..make him feel like he just pleased you in every way possible. This is also a great time to ask for stuff ;)\n\n5. Go another round.. if he\u2019s able lol. You\u2019re laying there in his arms, listening to his short stories, reach down and touch him while he\u2019s talking. After a moment ask, \u201cYou got another round in you in? If he says no, he\u2019ll appreciate the effort\n\n6. Whatever you guys are doing, keep it fun and exciting!! You\u2019re giving him an experience that he just can\u2019t and does not get anywhere else. Plus the better and more memorable the experience is, the more committed he will be to the arrangement. \n\nOnce again this will not feel like a hard task if you genuinely like the person you\u2019re with.",

I found this goes a long way to removing the 'transactional' feeling of SRs. It's also not hard to do. I know the OP was aimed at SBs, but I think it applies equally to SDs. I feel a small, but well targeted act - that shows you know the other person - goes a lot further than something a little more pricey but generic.",

They hear the lie and they act like they don't, but they remember and tally it. They are wise enough to not call out the lies. \n\nLies meant to manipulate are an invitation to a game of who is smarter. When you join the game it's best that your opponent doesn't even know you're playing.",

You\u2019re laying there in his arms, listening to his short stories, reach down and touch him while he\u2019s talking. After a moment ask, \u201cYou got another round in you in? If he says no, he\u2019ll appreciate the effort\n\nIf he says he doesn't have another round in him, he may still enjoy the effort a woman can put into pleasing him. I had someone I used to see that even if I couldn't go another round, sometimes she would give me oral after we had sex and she'd get a 2nd round out of me. This was always a really great gesture on her part, and made me feel appreciated and helped solidify my believe that she truly cared about me, and was into me.",
