    "body": "I know we talk a lot about allowance/PPM, gifts and luxury experiences on here a lot but what other ways have you fellow SBs been invested in? And for SDs what are some other ways you have invested in the personal growth and success of your SBs? What really attracted me to this lifestyle was the ability to leverage the resources that a SD had to help propel me down my path to success and abundance. Above getting bags and vacays, I really wanted a SD who would make a conscious effort to invest in me. My current SD recently paid $$$$ for a very expensive prep course for me to study for my MCAT to get into medical school and I appreciated it more than any grip of cash he\u2019s given me. I know a lot of us SBs are very career driven and goal-oriented ladies so I just wanted to have a dialogue about it. \n\nLet\u2019s talk! \ud83d\ude0a",

My favorite part of it all was it wasn\u2019t something she even knew was possible and I just spent some time hammering away and sent over some stuff and she was so amazed. Then she says, I wish I had some visibility to, or tracking of something, And I just send over a revision with what was wished for. I have really enjoyed the project and it saves her so much time having good systems in place. Not my most time consuming thing I did, but probably the most impactful. It honestly is a point of pride in my career. I have done a lot of impactful work over the years, but it has always been for bigger companies. So they care, but they don\u2019t have their heart poured into it like this. To work on someone\u2019s baby and help it grow and change and get better has been really rewarding. Hopefully you can find someone like me to do the same for your company. \n\nAs a note, in case I sound pompous, there is no part of what she does I could do. What I do feels easy to me, that is why I do it. What she does is easy to her, that is why she does it. I am amazed at the work she does as much as she is amazed at what I do.",

Aside from allowance, I helped build out a project plan and budget for everything she would need to get there and be able to live for 6 months while she found her footing, got a job, etc. I also was able to help get her a position in a law office (here) to work at and bought her a professional wardrobe when she landed the job. As her going away present I bought her plane tickets and covered 1st month rent overseas.\n\n3 years after she left, she's doing great and is close to getting her degree. A few months ago I got a really heartwarming email with an update on how she's doing, as well as reflections on our relationship, what I meant to her, and how much I helped achieve her success (she was being far too generous, she's incredibly intelligent and hard working, and would be a success no matter what). Turns out she was contemplating a couple fields to get into for grad school, and I had some good contacts in those fields, so introduced them on LinkedIn. After having zoom calls with those people, she's landed on the degree she wants to pursue next. Makes me so proud and happy to be able to continue to contribute towards her success and future.",

An SD can help a SB grow, helping her become the best-version of herself. We're her safety net, her overdraft, her emotional support and rock-solid foundation. We can also do more, and help them navigate the difficult and treacherous decisions in life, and protect them from the perils of compulsion, (food, fashion, plastic-surgery) addiction, and delusions (of perfection).",

Assuming we stay together (she plans to work a couple of years after she graduates from tech school), I'll pay for that as well. She'll be able to go into practice without any student loan debt and she'll be set for the rest of her life.  \n\nI also provided her with seed money to start an investment account with Vanguard and taught her how to invest. She should be able to go to work and not have any debt, and continue adding money to her investments, and will be able to retire on her own terms some day. I don't think it's possible to put her in a better position for the rest of her life than all of that.",

My favorite part of it all was it wasn\u2019t something she even knew was possible and I just spent some time hammering away and sent over some stuff and she was so amazed. Then she says, I wish I had some visibility to, or tracking of something, And I just send over a revision with what was wished for. I have really enjoyed the project and it saves her so much time having good systems in place. Not my most time consuming thing I did, but probably the most impactful. It honestly is a point of pride in my career. I have done a lot of impactful work over the years, but it has always been for bigger companies. So they care, but they don\u2019t have their heart poured into it like this. To work on someone\u2019s baby and help it grow and change and get better has been really rewarding. Hopefully you can find someone like me to do the same for your company. \n\nAs a note, in case I sound pompous, there is no part of what she does I could do. What I do feels easy to me, that is why I do it. What she does is easy to her, that is why she does it. I am amazed at the work she does as much as she is amazed at what I do.",

            "body": "She regularly lets me know how much she appreciates me, and I love it. My favorite part of it all was it wasn\u2019t something she even knew was possible and I just spent some time hammering away and sent over some stuff and she was so amazed. Then she says, I wish I had some visibility to, or tracking of something, And I just send over a revision with what was wished for. I have really enjoyed the project and it saves her so much time having good systems in place. Not my most time consuming thing I did, but probably the most impactful. It honestly is a point of pride in my career. I have done a lot of impactful work over the years, but it has always been for bigger companies. So they care, but they don\u2019t have their heart poured into it like this. To work on someone\u2019s baby and help it grow and change and get better has been really rewarding. Hopefully you can find someone like me to do the same for your company. \n\nAs a note, in case I sound pompous, there is no part of what she does I could do. What I do feels easy to me, that is why I do it. What she does is easy to her, that is why she does it. I am amazed at the work she does as much as she is amazed at what I do.",
