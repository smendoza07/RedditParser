    "body": "I don't know what goes through some of these guys' heads. I live in Chicago and this guy messaged me on SA asking if I would be open to going to New York to meet him. Red flag in itself because we BOTH live in sugar oasis' and there are plenty of SDs and SBs for us to choose from in our own cities but I went along with it just to see his offer. He then proceeded to tell me there would be no allowance since he would be paying for my flight and expenses while I was there. I'm sorry lol what? no? That would ENTIRELY benefit him. I would have to take time off work, fly to see him, stop my life for a week...all for what lmao? I said no, I'm not cool with that and he called me entitled. Don't fall for this kind of stuff, ladies. It's called a mutually beneficial arrangement for a reason and this guy was either a scammer of some sort or a guy who is just looking for a naive girl to give him free sugar. Absolutely ridiculous.",

Accordingly, that being the case, of course all you're after from a SD is good old-fashioned hard cash, and therefore, none of what I suggested applies to you.   \n\n\nBut if you're not in it just for the money... if, in fact, you don't really need the money but are into it exclusively for the lifestyle... then, when a SB or whatever you want to call him spends $15k to treat you for a luxury weekend, you manage to appreciate the inherent value in the experience and don't feel ripped off that he's not throwing in a meaningless PPM on top of it.  \n\n\nYou're not even the OP and you're telling us all why the hell would you sign up for something like this? The degree of entitlement around here is reflective of what's happened to SA in general.

Shopping, luxury travel first class, fanciest hotels - that\u2019s what a rich BF can offer, I mean I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t understand how can you call yourself a SD and not a vanilla BF or FWB if all you offer is this. And don\u2019t get me wrong, treating a woman to luxury is an amazing thing and generous of you, but this is not sugar. Sugar is there for me to invest in my business, my future, my hobbies. All the shopping in the world will not compare. The kind of things I do with allowance, - I don\u2019t buy shoes, handbags, jewellery, - I invest it into my future, therefore, I agree to disagree but shopping and first class experience will not advance me or benefit me in any way, shape or form and I feel like that is the epitome of shallow.

The fact that you and OP also have vanilla relationships on the side kind of backs what I was saying; neither of you are the type that are after experiences if you already have \"real\" BFs that treat you to all of that. Accordingly, that being the case, of course all you're after from a SD is good old-fashioned hard cash, and therefore, none of what I suggested applies to you.   \n\n\nBut if you're not in it just for the money... if, in fact, you don't really need the money but are into it exclusively for the lifestyle... then, when a SB or whatever you want to call him spends $15k to treat you for a luxury weekend, you manage to appreciate the inherent value in the experience and don't feel ripped off that he's not throwing in a meaningless PPM on top of it.  \n\n\nYou're not even the OP and you're telling us all why the hell would you sign up for something like this? The degree of entitlement around here is reflective of what's happened to SA in general. You (as in OP and yourself) aren't that interested in a true SR... it seems like mOnEy is the starting point and end point for you. That's terrific; I'm so happy you've found both types of relationships (let's call them \"real\" and \"fake\") to suit your needs. But to act bewildered like this is the only thing anyone is looking for... lol... come on.",

Shopping, luxury travel first class, fanciest hotels - that\u2019s what a rich BF can offer, I mean I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t understand how can you call yourself a SD and not a vanilla BF or FWB if all you offer is this. And don\u2019t get me wrong, treating a woman to luxury is an amazing thing and generous of you, but this is not sugar. Sugar is there for me to invest in my business, my future, my hobbies. All the shopping in the world will not compare. The kind of things I do with allowance, - I don\u2019t buy shoes, handbags, jewellery, - I invest it into my future, therefore, I agree to disagree but shopping and first class experience will not advance me or benefit me in any way, shape or form and I feel like that is the epitome of shallow. We\u2019re in this lifetime for shallow reasons anyway, - one is for looks, the other is for money, so why pretend?",

No amount of shopping or experiences could ever compare to that, and I am fortunate to have had many of those.

Accordingly, that being the case, of course all you're after from a SD is good old-fashioned hard cash, and therefore, none of what I suggested applies to you.   \n\n\nBut if you're not in it just for the money... if, in fact, you don't really need the money but are into it exclusively for the lifestyle... then, when a SB or whatever you want to call him spends $15k to treat you for a luxury weekend, you manage to appreciate the inherent value in the experience and don't feel ripped off that he's not throwing in a meaningless PPM on top of it.  \n\n\nYou're not even the OP and you're telling us all why the hell would you sign up for something like this?

And all I am saying is that for a lot of women, possibly more than you might imagine, it's not all about the money... and \"experience\" is among those top other reasons, along with true mentoring and networking and a bunch of others.\n\nI was going to try to convince you that it's not all about money, but it seems you -- two months ago -- would've already been agreeing with me.\n\nMerry Xmas!",
