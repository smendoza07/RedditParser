Moments later, the actress contacted the netizen herself, saying \u201cI am the owner of the wallet\u201d through a phone call.\n\nAccording to the netizen, they met up with the Running Man cast member at a specific meet-up location. And while they expected the actress\u2019s manager or a different agency representative to show up to retrieve the wallet, Jeon So Min came to the location and met up with the netizen herself.\n\n*The CEO of her agency, the one who had previously appeared on KBS\u2019s \u2018Happy Together\u2019 was driving the car. He remained in the car and waited for her as Jeon So Min met me at the location to get her wallet back.*\n\n*\u2014 Netizen*\n\nNot only did the actress pick up the wallet herself, but the netizen further shared that Jeon So Min offered a token of gratitude in the form of a monetary reward.\n\nWhile the location where Jeon So Min lost her wallet was not disclosed, the netizen revealed that they contacted her agency after recognizing her through the contents of her wallet.\n\nBefore exchanging their farewells, the netizen shared that they had asked the Running Man member for a photo, to which Jeon So Min responded in the most Jeon So Min way possible.\n\n*I should have worn some makeup before I came out.*\n\n*\u2014 Jeon So Min*\n\nThe netizen continued with their praises for the actress, as they shared Jeon So Min\u2019s kind hearted nature was revealed through her actions. As the actress was heading out to her car, the netizen shared that she told them, \u201cyou will be blessed\u201d while bowing 90 degrees as a farewell.\n\nJeon So Min is such a sweetheart! In related news, Running Man viewers will not be able to see the actress in the next two upcoming episodes as she focuses on recovering from her foot surgery.\n\nRunning Man won\u2019t be the same without her, but we hope she recovers well!\n\n*ORIGINAL SOURCE:* [*https://www.wikitree.co.kr/articles/728461*](https://www.wikitree.co.kr/articles/728461)\n\n(Edited for grammatical errors)",
