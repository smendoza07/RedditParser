    "body": "\nTLDR: Accidentally scared the bejesus out of a former SD who ghosted me. \n\n\nI'm going to preface this by saying it was complete happenstance. I would never intentionally do this to someone just because they were kind of a jerk. Discretion is as vital to me as it is to anyone I've ever had an arrangement with, and short of the discovery of seriously harmful criminal activity I would never put anyone in a position to be \"outed\" as an SD or SB, or even just in an awkward position due to that relationship. Now, on to the story. \n\n\nI joined the bowl a few years ago. My second experience was a guy who I texted for a bit, had a non-sexual M&G with, then a second date that was purely sexual (ppm delivered as promised). After that he ghosted via SA and text. At first I figured he was just annoyed because I insisted he wear a condom (sorry, bub, them's the rules), or maybe I just wasn't his type (I'm a BBW, but I'm very clear about that before I ever meet someone) and he is the type to ghost instead of being upfront. Annoying, but whatever. Then I noticed he would occasionally pop up in Venmo (how he delivered my PPM), always to a young woman approximately my age and body type, and never to the same girl twice. Ah, he's a one hit wonder. That makes sense. Still think he's a bit of a jerk for ghosting, but whatevs. Live and learn. \n\n\nFast forward to today, almost three years later. We work in the same industry, but he is a one man operation and I work for a much larger corporate entity in a slightly different area of expertise. But lo and behold, the twain have met, and we just unexpectedly came face to face in my office's conference room surrounded by his colleagues, various other secretaries, a transcriptionist, and clients. \n\n\nI was perfectly polite and professional, just said hello and went about my business. But I'm not going to lie, the rapid (yet felt like slow motion) progression on his face of \"why does she look familiar...\" to \"oh, that's...\" to mild/moderate panic was worth every bit of annoyance I ever felt over him. \ud83e\udd23 Judging by the look on his face I'm guessing this is the first time he's run into one of the women he has ghosted in a professional setting. As stated at the beginning, I wouldn't dream of having done that intentionally. I'm occasionally petty but not stupid. But goodness, I got a good chuckle out of the situation. \n\n\nMoral of the Story: If you treat people poorly it's likely to come back to haunt you when you least expect it.",
