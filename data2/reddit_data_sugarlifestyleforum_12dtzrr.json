As a man, if I was setting up ANY meeting with a woman who would meet me alone, my primary thought is \"how can I make this comfortable for her\". Any man is a jerk who wouldn't respond \"of course we can meet in a public place. I totally understand. That was my intention too\". For one thing, an initial \"date\" is about building a comfortable environment for the woman to relax, open up and be able to appraise you and decide if there's an emotion connection. If you're starting things off by insisting that she enter a situation that would have any woman's defense instincts jangling \"red alert\", ain't no way you're going to have a successful first date. This guy doesn't have the people skills to be a good attorney that I'd want to work with.  \n\n\nI got a chance to explain this reality in life to my 17yr old son recently. We were hiking in the redwood forests here in California and he asked me why, when we met a single or pair of women hikers, they always moved to the other side of the trail and kept their distance whereas male hikers were much more easy going and would pass close to us. He asked about the women, \"Do they not like us or something?\". I told him, \"Look, this is very important for you to understand as a young man. When you encounter a woman all by herself, one of the thoughts going through her head is 'I really hope this bigger and stronger man doesn't suddenly attack me'. Be grateful you don't have to go through life thinking that way. In fact, we should make it easy for them by moving to the other side of the trail first to demonstrate that we respect them and we're no threat before we give them a wave and a friendly hello\"",

You just pay the spa, the shop, the hospital and wait for your appointment.

But there are a few tells in the writing style. \"But to say it at the outset...\"  Who besides lawyers and courts of appeals talk that way?

You just pay the spa, the shop, the hospital and wait for your appointment. But if you care at all about a long-term relationship with these people, you may spend some time shopping around by visiting several, or having some criteria on if you'll visit them again.... ... .. which will always cost time and money. So, regardless of what he meant by \"if a woman doesn't have a connection with me she can just leave\" the sugar babies are pointing out that passing an interview before a long-term relationship is too high of a hurdle for him, there ARE transactional services he can pay for and have guaranteed service.\n\nAnd instead of interviewing with the girl he'll be interviewing with the girl's boss... \ud83e\udd23 Congratulations on dodging getting dressed and driving someplace.",
