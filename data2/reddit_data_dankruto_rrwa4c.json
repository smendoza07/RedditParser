Besides Tobirama being the brother and skipping the 3 Sanin cause they\u2019re all a mess as people and weren\u2019t fit to lead at the time. \n\nSo they skipped a Sanin for Minato, then got a Sanin way later, then went to Minato\u2019s student, Kakashi, when he was old enough. \n\nI feel like teams were purposely made like this though. Like the previous hokage knew what students to give them and leading them was the jonin\u2019s test to see if they\u2019re fit to become hokage and lead the village.",

A mission hidden, on the sidelines of the story\u2019s narrative around being Hokage. He became an intelligent, experienced, wisdom-full sage. The Hokage seat was never for him, he\u2019s not that type of guy, if some drunk guy came up on Jiraiya, initially he wouldn\u2019t express qualities of leadership, or what\u2019s right (at first). Jiraiya will settle the guy down with a joking manner, or act overconfident. And then maybe if it gets serious, he\u2019ll get serious and be that leadership person.\n\nMy point is, he\u2019s not a Hokage person, someone with that already established leadership quality, it\u2019s there, but he\u2019s gonna wanna laze around or be who he feels like he should be.",

A mission hidden, on the sidelines of the story\u2019s narrative around being Hokage. He became an intelligent, experienced, wisdom-full sage. The Hokage seat was never for him, he\u2019s not that type of guy, if some drunk guy came up on Jiraiya, initially he wouldn\u2019t express qualities of leadership, or what\u2019s right (at first). Jiraiya will settle the guy down with a joking manner, or act overconfident. And then maybe if it gets serious, he\u2019ll get serious and be that leadership person.\n\nMy point is, he\u2019s not a Hokage person, someone with that already established leadership quality, it\u2019s there, but he\u2019s gonna wanna laze around or be who he feels like he should be.",
