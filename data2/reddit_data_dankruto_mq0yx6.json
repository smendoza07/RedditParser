As an old naruto fan it was easy to be tempted to skip episodes at times, but the truth is that you really don\u2019t know which episodes are filler and which ones aren\u2019t unless you do research about it, since there are soooo many new characters; and relevant ones at that. The story has definitely gone a bit off the rails IMO but it\u2019s still all good fun and the animation and music are as great as ever!",

As an old naruto fan it was easy to be tempted to skip episodes at times, but the truth is that you really don\u2019t know which episodes are filler and which ones aren\u2019t unless you do research about it, since there are soooo many new characters; and relevant ones at that. The story has definitely gone a bit off the rails IMO but it\u2019s still all good fun and the animation and music are as great as ever!",
