Im pretty sure Boruto and Sasuke even time travel to stop one of them from killing young Naruto, I haven't watched it but people say it's a good arc. \n\nAnd in the manga atm Boruto and his brother have gotten the same power as them too(Not technically his brother but he does live with Naruto and his family)",
