Most ninjas die before their 40s/50s (At least before Boruto, which I guess is supposed to be a more peaceful era) so being an old ninja demands respect and implies that you're a badass with tons of valuable experience.\n\nNot to mention how much Japanese culture respects old age in general (old characters that are remotely important to the story are always badasses in anime). Wisdom is definitely not underestimated over there.",

The others acted more are team leaders and counselors than teachers. It's usually the families who are in charge or so one commissioned like it happened for Konohamaru. So for Sasuke it makes sense for Kakashi to take that role. But what about Naruto and Sakura? Other than basic Chakra control Kakashi didn't teach them anything in preparation for the chunin exams. Sure they were strong but they didn't have much tools to defend themselves.\n\nMaybe I can understand not training Naruto becuase the fox makes him an odd case and was waiting for someone like Jairaiya to show up but why didn't he teach Sakura genjutus which we know he knows?",

Why would she learn genjutsu when her entire motivation is to chase Sasuke, and Sasuke will always be immune to her shit on account of having broken af eyes? And at that point, Sakura was already an unpopular character and Kishi didn't have many ideas or passion for developing her, so he just turned her into diet Tsunade to complete the Sannin teaching Team Seven thing. \n\nThere's also the fact that nearly every single female ends up knowing medical ninjutsu so he could've just been stuck in the female = fantasy healer thinking all along and not realized how boring it is.",

Imagine if Sakura developed a tecnique along with Kakashi to fight the Sharingan's genjutsu. This would have leveled the field a bit as well as make her seem important.",

If a character (especially a main character) is unpopular, then you be doing *more* to write them better, not just give up on them, especially this early in the series. \n\n\n\nTbh I don't think that was the case anyway.

So for Sasuke it makes sense for Kakashi to take that role. But what about Naruto and Sakura? Other than basic Chakra control Kakashi didn't teach them anything in preparation for the chunin exams. Sure they were strong but they didn't have much tools to defend themselves.\n\nMaybe I can understand not training Naruto becuase the fox makes him an odd case and was waiting for someone like Jairaiya to show up but why didn't he teach Sakura genjutus which we know he knows?",

If a character (especially a main character) is unpopular, then you be doing *more* to write them better, not just give up on them, especially this early in the series. \n\n\n\nTbh I don't think that was the case anyway.

So for Sasuke it makes sense for Kakashi to take that role. But what about Naruto and Sakura? Other than basic Chakra control Kakashi didn't teach them anything in preparation for the chunin exams. Sure they were strong but they didn't have much tools to defend themselves.\n\nMaybe I can understand not training Naruto becuase the fox makes him an odd case and was waiting for someone like Jairaiya to show up but why didn't he teach Sakura genjutus which we know he knows?",

Most ninjas die before their 40s/50s (At least before Boruto, which I guess is supposed to be a more peaceful era) so being an old ninja demands respect and implies that you're a badass with tons of valuable experience.\n\nNot to mention how much Japanese culture respects old age in general (old characters that are remotely important to the story are always badasses in anime). Wisdom is definitely not underestimated over there.",
