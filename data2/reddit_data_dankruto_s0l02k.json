The wording implies the sharingan is what makes it into Raikiri, but that\u2019s not true. Kakashi only ever stopped using Chidori for the short period between his injury and obtaining Obito\u2019s eye, and he continued to call it Chidori for many years afterwards. Not to mention if that was the case, Sasuke should have never called his jutsu Chidori\n\nGuy nicknamed Kakashi\u2019s Chidori \u201cRaikiri\u201d after he cut a bolt of lightning in half to protect their squad. Kakashi simply went along with the nickname because he felt it was cooler.\n\nI don\u2019t believe Kakashi has ever corrected someone who called his Raikiri \u201cChidori\u201d. \n\nThe only instance I can think of where the name mattered is when Deidara kept calling Sasuke\u2019s Chidori \u201cRaikiri\u201d and Sasuke corrected him because Sasuke has never cut a bolt of lightning.",

It lets you memorize and copy others' hand seals, not their chakra nature. Kakashi mastered the chakra natures by himself, then when he sees a jutsu he applies the correct nature to the hand seals to correctly copy it. That is why what he did was impressive and earned the title of \"copy ninja\". Sasuke also had to train to master lightning nature instead of just copying it (and because Sasuke was a prodigy and a genius he learned it quick, but he couldn't copy it). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Just because wind is not his affinity does not mean he cannot do wind jutsu.\n\nNo him never doing it and sending Naruto to Asuma when Naruto asked him if he knows anyone (besides Naruto) that has wind nature to help him with it means that he cannot do wind jutsu. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>It\u2019s just not as powerful as someone like Asuma who\u2019s main speciality is wind.\n\nConsidering his affinity is lightning yet he could keep up with Zabuza with water style, do advanced earth styles jutsus, and his fireball was as big as Itachi (anime only), if Kakashi had wind release he would be average at the very least and could have helped Naruto.",

You act as if the Sharingan copying hand seals and elemental jutsu is not the same thing... you copy the hand seals to do the jutsu. \n\n\n\nSasuke coukdnt outright copy Chidori because it\u2019s not only an elemental jutsu, it has shape transformation. That\u2019s the reason Sasuke practiced for it extensively. He sent Naruto to Asuma because Asuma is more proficient at wind then him.... he can still copy wind style jutsus. This is proven by 12 year old Sarada seeing jutsu hand signs and copying them right after. She did this with Lightning Style: Lightning Ball and even copied wind style gale palm as well as shadow clones with little experience with non fire elemental jutsu.\n\nWind Style Jutsu requires extreme precision and refined chakra control which is the reason why he sent Naruto to Asuma.... Because Asuma is more skilled at wind style then Kakashi. \n\nKakashi can copy a wind style jutsu, he\u2019s just not as proficient in it as he is with lightning, earth, etc. You don\u2019t need to have an affinity for an element to copy the hand seals to do the jutsu.",

Additionally, for those who can't why would you not strengthen your arsenal of moves so incase your main doesnt work youre not completely screwed? I look at Shikamaru, if his shadow is useless than he can't do shit in a fight. Luckily though Shikamaru is a genius and will figure out some way to get then anyways.",

The wording implies the sharingan is what makes it into Raikiri, but that\u2019s not true. Kakashi only ever stopped using Chidori for the short period between his injury and obtaining Obito\u2019s eye, and he continued to call it Chidori for many years afterwards. Not to mention if that was the case, Sasuke should have never called his jutsu Chidori\n\nGuy nicknamed Kakashi\u2019s Chidori \u201cRaikiri\u201d after he cut a bolt of lightning in half to protect their squad. Kakashi simply went along with the nickname because he felt it was cooler.\n\nI don\u2019t believe Kakashi has ever corrected someone who called his Raikiri \u201cChidori\u201d. \n\nThe only instance I can think of where the name mattered is when Deidara kept calling Sasuke\u2019s Chidori \u201cRaikiri\u201d and Sasuke corrected him because Sasuke has never cut a bolt of lightning.",

It lets you memorize and copy others' hand seals, not their chakra nature. Kakashi mastered the chakra natures by himself, then when he sees a jutsu he applies the correct nature to the hand seals to correctly copy it. That is why what he did was impressive and earned the title of \"copy ninja\". Sasuke also had to train to master lightning nature instead of just copying it (and because Sasuke was a prodigy and a genius he learned it quick, but he couldn't copy it). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Just because wind is not his affinity does not mean he cannot do wind jutsu.\n\nNo him never doing it and sending Naruto to Asuma when Naruto asked him if he knows anyone (besides Naruto) that has wind nature to help him with it means that he cannot do wind jutsu. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>It\u2019s just not as powerful as someone like Asuma who\u2019s main speciality is wind.\n\nConsidering his affinity is lightning yet he could keep up with Zabuza with water style, do advanced earth styles jutsus, and his fireball was as big as Itachi (anime only), if Kakashi had wind release he would be average at the very least and could have helped Naruto.",

You act as if the Sharingan copying hand seals and elemental jutsu is not the same thing... you copy the hand seals to do the jutsu. \n\n\n\nSasuke coukdnt outright copy Chidori because it\u2019s not only an elemental jutsu, it has shape transformation. That\u2019s the reason Sasuke practiced for it extensively. He sent Naruto to Asuma because Asuma is more proficient at wind then him.... he can still copy wind style jutsus. This is proven by 12 year old Sarada seeing jutsu hand signs and copying them right after. She did this with Lightning Style: Lightning Ball and even copied wind style gale palm as well as shadow clones with little experience with non fire elemental jutsu.\n\nWind Style Jutsu requires extreme precision and refined chakra control which is the reason why he sent Naruto to Asuma.... Because Asuma is more skilled at wind style then Kakashi. \n\nKakashi can copy a wind style jutsu, he\u2019s just not as proficient in it as he is with lightning, earth, etc. You don\u2019t need to have an affinity for an element to copy the hand seals to do the jutsu.",

Additionally, for those who can't why would you not strengthen your arsenal of moves so incase your main doesnt work youre not completely screwed?

The wording implies the sharingan is what makes it into Raikiri, but that\u2019s not true. Kakashi only ever stopped using Chidori for the short period between his injury and obtaining Obito\u2019s eye, and he continued to call it Chidori for many years afterwards. Not to mention if that was the case, Sasuke should have never called his jutsu Chidori\n\nGuy nicknamed Kakashi\u2019s Chidori \u201cRaikiri\u201d after he cut a bolt of lightning in half to protect their squad. Kakashi simply went along with the nickname because he felt it was cooler.\n\nI don\u2019t believe Kakashi has ever corrected someone who called his Raikiri \u201cChidori\u201d. \n\nThe only instance I can think of where the name mattered is when Deidara kept calling Sasuke\u2019s Chidori \u201cRaikiri\u201d and Sasuke corrected him because Sasuke has never cut a bolt of lightning.",

It lets you memorize and copy others' hand seals, not their chakra nature. Kakashi mastered the chakra natures by himself, then when he sees a jutsu he applies the correct nature to the hand seals to correctly copy it. That is why what he did was impressive and earned the title of \"copy ninja\". Sasuke also had to train to master lightning nature instead of just copying it (and because Sasuke was a prodigy and a genius he learned it quick, but he couldn't copy it). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Just because wind is not his affinity does not mean he cannot do wind jutsu.\n\nNo him never doing it and sending Naruto to Asuma when Naruto asked him if he knows anyone (besides Naruto) that has wind nature to help him with it means that he cannot do wind jutsu. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>It\u2019s just not as powerful as someone like Asuma who\u2019s main speciality is wind.\n\nConsidering his affinity is lightning yet he could keep up with Zabuza with water style, do advanced earth styles jutsus, and his fireball was as big as Itachi (anime only), if Kakashi had wind release he would be average at the very least and could have helped Naruto.",

You act as if the Sharingan copying hand seals and elemental jutsu is not the same thing... you copy the hand seals to do the jutsu. \n\n\n\nSasuke coukdnt outright copy Chidori because it\u2019s not only an elemental jutsu, it has shape transformation. That\u2019s the reason Sasuke practiced for it extensively. He sent Naruto to Asuma because Asuma is more proficient at wind then him.... he can still copy wind style jutsus. This is proven by 12 year old Sarada seeing jutsu hand signs and copying them right after. She did this with Lightning Style: Lightning Ball and even copied wind style gale palm as well as shadow clones with little experience with non fire elemental jutsu.\n\nWind Style Jutsu requires extreme precision and refined chakra control which is the reason why he sent Naruto to Asuma.... Because Asuma is more skilled at wind style then Kakashi. \n\nKakashi can copy a wind style jutsu, he\u2019s just not as proficient in it as he is with lightning, earth, etc. You don\u2019t need to have an affinity for an element to copy the hand seals to do the jutsu.",

Additionally, for those who can't why would you not strengthen your arsenal of moves so incase your main doesnt work youre not completely screwed? I look at Shikamaru, if his shadow is useless than he can't do shit in a fight. Luckily though Shikamaru is a genius and will figure out some way to get then anyways.",

The wording implies the sharingan is what makes it into Raikiri, but that\u2019s not true. Kakashi only ever stopped using Chidori for the short period between his injury and obtaining Obito\u2019s eye, and he continued to call it Chidori for many years afterwards. Not to mention if that was the case, Sasuke should have never called his jutsu Chidori\n\nGuy nicknamed Kakashi\u2019s Chidori \u201cRaikiri\u201d after he cut a bolt of lightning in half to protect their squad. Kakashi simply went along with the nickname because he felt it was cooler.\n\nI don\u2019t believe Kakashi has ever corrected someone who called his Raikiri \u201cChidori\u201d. \n\nThe only instance I can think of where the name mattered is when Deidara kept calling Sasuke\u2019s Chidori \u201cRaikiri\u201d and Sasuke corrected him because Sasuke has never cut a bolt of lightning.",

It lets you memorize and copy others' hand seals, not their chakra nature. Kakashi mastered the chakra natures by himself, then when he sees a jutsu he applies the correct nature to the hand seals to correctly copy it. That is why what he did was impressive and earned the title of \"copy ninja\". Sasuke also had to train to master lightning nature instead of just copying it (and because Sasuke was a prodigy and a genius he learned it quick, but he couldn't copy it). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Just because wind is not his affinity does not mean he cannot do wind jutsu.\n\nNo him never doing it and sending Naruto to Asuma when Naruto asked him if he knows anyone (besides Naruto) that has wind nature to help him with it means that he cannot do wind jutsu. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>It\u2019s just not as powerful as someone like Asuma who\u2019s main speciality is wind.\n\nConsidering his affinity is lightning yet he could keep up with Zabuza with water style, do advanced earth styles jutsus, and his fireball was as big as Itachi (anime only), if Kakashi had wind release he would be average at the very least and could have helped Naruto.",

You act as if the Sharingan copying hand seals and elemental jutsu is not the same thing... you copy the hand seals to do the jutsu. \n\n\n\nSasuke coukdnt outright copy Chidori because it\u2019s not only an elemental jutsu, it has shape transformation. That\u2019s the reason Sasuke practiced for it extensively. He sent Naruto to Asuma because Asuma is more proficient at wind then him.... he can still copy wind style jutsus. This is proven by 12 year old Sarada seeing jutsu hand signs and copying them right after. She did this with Lightning Style: Lightning Ball and even copied wind style gale palm as well as shadow clones with little experience with non fire elemental jutsu.\n\nWind Style Jutsu requires extreme precision and refined chakra control which is the reason why he sent Naruto to Asuma.... Because Asuma is more skilled at wind style then Kakashi. \n\nKakashi can copy a wind style jutsu, he\u2019s just not as proficient in it as he is with lightning, earth, etc. You don\u2019t need to have an affinity for an element to copy the hand seals to do the jutsu.",

It lets you memorize and copy others' hand seals, not their chakra nature. Kakashi mastered the chakra natures by himself, then when he sees a jutsu he applies the correct nature to the hand seals to correctly copy it. That is why what he did was impressive and earned the title of \"copy ninja\". Sasuke also had to train to master lightning nature instead of just copying it (and because Sasuke was a prodigy and a genius he learned it quick, but he couldn't copy it). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Just because wind is not his affinity does not mean he cannot do wind jutsu.\n\nNo him never doing it and sending Naruto to Asuma when Naruto asked him if he knows anyone (besides Naruto) that has wind nature to help him with it means that he cannot do wind jutsu. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>It\u2019s just not as powerful as someone like Asuma who\u2019s main speciality is wind.\n\nConsidering his affinity is lightning yet he could keep up with Zabuza with water style, do advanced earth styles jutsus, and his fireball was as big as Itachi (anime only), if Kakashi had wind release he would be average at the very least and could have helped Naruto.",

You act as if the Sharingan copying hand seals and elemental jutsu is not the same thing... you copy the hand seals to do the jutsu. \n\n\n\nSasuke coukdnt outright copy Chidori because it\u2019s not only an elemental jutsu, it has shape transformation. That\u2019s the reason Sasuke practiced for it extensively. He sent Naruto to Asuma because Asuma is more proficient at wind then him.... he can still copy wind style jutsus. This is proven by 12 year old Sarada seeing jutsu hand signs and copying them right after. She did this with Lightning Style: Lightning Ball and even copied wind style gale palm as well as shadow clones with little experience with non fire elemental jutsu.\n\nWind Style Jutsu requires extreme precision and refined chakra control which is the reason why he sent Naruto to Asuma.... Because Asuma is more skilled at wind style then Kakashi. \n\nKakashi can copy a wind style jutsu, he\u2019s just not as proficient in it as he is with lightning, earth, etc. You don\u2019t need to have an affinity for an element to copy the hand seals to do the jutsu.",

It lets you memorize and copy others' hand seals, not their chakra nature. Kakashi mastered the chakra natures by himself, then when he sees a jutsu he applies the correct nature to the hand seals to correctly copy it. That is why what he did was impressive and earned the title of \"copy ninja\". Sasuke also had to train to master lightning nature instead of just copying it (and because Sasuke was a prodigy and a genius he learned it quick, but he couldn't copy it). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Just because wind is not his affinity does not mean he cannot do wind jutsu.\n\nNo him never doing it and sending Naruto to Asuma when Naruto asked him if he knows anyone (besides Naruto) that has wind nature to help him with it means that he cannot do wind jutsu. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>It\u2019s just not as powerful as someone like Asuma who\u2019s main speciality is wind.\n\nConsidering his affinity is lightning yet he could keep up with Zabuza with water style, do advanced earth styles jutsus, and his fireball was as big as Itachi (anime only), if Kakashi had wind release he would be average at the very least and could have helped Naruto.",

You act as if the Sharingan copying hand seals and elemental jutsu is not the same thing... you copy the hand seals to do the jutsu. \n\n\n\nSasuke coukdnt outright copy Chidori because it\u2019s not only an elemental jutsu, it has shape transformation. That\u2019s the reason Sasuke practiced for it extensively. He sent Naruto to Asuma because Asuma is more proficient at wind then him.... he can still copy wind style jutsus. This is proven by 12 year old Sarada seeing jutsu hand signs and copying them right after. She did this with Lightning Style: Lightning Ball and even copied wind style gale palm as well as shadow clones with little experience with non fire elemental jutsu.\n\nWind Style Jutsu requires extreme precision and refined chakra control which is the reason why he sent Naruto to Asuma.... Because Asuma is more skilled at wind style then Kakashi. \n\nKakashi can copy a wind style jutsu, he\u2019s just not as proficient in it as he is with lightning, earth, etc. You don\u2019t need to have an affinity for an element to copy the hand seals to do the jutsu.",

            "body": "Obviously the name copy ninja is a nickname lmfao. When did I say it was a class? You act as if the Sharingan copying hand seals and elemental jutsu is not the same thing... you copy the hand seals to do the jutsu. \n\n\n\nSasuke coukdnt outright copy Chidori because it\u2019s not only an elemental jutsu, it has shape transformation. That\u2019s the reason Sasuke practiced for it extensively. He sent Naruto to Asuma because Asuma is more proficient at wind then him.... he can still copy wind style jutsus. This is proven by 12 year old Sarada seeing jutsu hand signs and copying them right after. She did this with Lightning Style: Lightning Ball and even copied wind style gale palm as well as shadow clones with little experience with non fire elemental jutsu.\n\nWind Style Jutsu requires extreme precision and refined chakra control which is the reason why he sent Naruto to Asuma.... Because Asuma is more skilled at wind style then Kakashi. \n\nKakashi can copy a wind style jutsu, he\u2019s just not as proficient in it as he is with lightning, earth, etc. You don\u2019t need to have an affinity for an element to copy the hand seals to do the jutsu.",
