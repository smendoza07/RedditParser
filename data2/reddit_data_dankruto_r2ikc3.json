Pretty sure Madara was going blind from spamming his by the time Izuna was dying from tobirama's ass whooping, and Izuna's eyes were less blind than Madara's so he offered them to him since he wouldn't need them after he died.\n\n\nAs for Sasuke & Itachi, they couldn't swap because Sasuke never had a MS to swap for while Itachi was alive. So Sasuke's eyes would've been useless to Itachi.",

Each time tho, there is no blood present. The only instance where there is blood present is when Obito and Sakura attempt to bring Sasuke through the amped Kamui Portal. Obito nearly falls over in exhaustion after this.\n\nMeanwhile Amaterasu seems to be the most damaging as blood is seen almost every time its used. I believe Kagutsuchi as well.\n\nI forget what happens with the MS Genjutsu's but I don't recall blood present with Itachi's Tsukuyomi but he seems tired af each time. I'm not sure, it's not a perfect theory.",

You need to kill a loved one to get MS and 2. You need to kill a sibling with MS and take their eyes to get EMS.\n\nThe belief was that Madara killed his brothers, not that his brother's died in battle vs the senju.\n\nThis lead to MS becoming a 'forbidden jutsu' among the clan, cause of course if you killed a loved one for MS you never loved them in the first place. \n\nIt's why the uchia police antagonised Itachi when investigating Shisui's death. Likely they wanted to bait out Itachi's MS which would confirm in their minds Itachi killed Shisui for MS.",

If you transplant the eye into someone who is not uchiha like kakashi then the person receiving it wouldnt be able to turn on or off the sharingan. So for a successful sharingan transplant the sharingan eye has to be active and it would permanently stay active as long as the non uchiha has it. SPOILERS AHEAD. Mangekyou is awakened by witnessing the death of the person most dear to you. Kakashi killed rin, his last teammate to his knowledge. Obito also witnessed. They both awakened mangekyou sharingan \"MS\". For Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan \"EMS\" you need a direct relative's MS implanted into you.",

Obito nearly falls over in exhaustion after this.\n\nMeanwhile Amaterasu seems to be the most damaging as blood is seen almost every time its used. I believe Kagutsuchi as well.\n\nI forget what happens with the MS Genjutsu's but I don't recall blood present with Itachi's Tsukuyomi but he seems tired af each time.

You need to kill a sibling with MS and take their eyes to get EMS.\n\nThe belief was that Madara killed his brothers, not that his brother's died in battle vs the senju.\n\nThis lead to MS becoming a 'forbidden jutsu' among the clan, cause of course if you killed a loved one for MS you never loved them in the first place. \n\nIt's why the uchia police antagonised Itachi when investigating Shisui's death. Likely they wanted to bait out Itachi's MS which would confirm in their minds Itachi killed Shisui for MS.",

So for a successful sharingan transplant the sharingan eye has to be active and it would permanently stay active as long as the non uchiha has it. SPOILERS AHEAD. Mangekyou is awakened by witnessing the death of the person most dear to you. Kakashi killed rin, his last teammate to his knowledge. Obito also witnessed. They both awakened mangekyou sharingan \"MS\". For Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan \"EMS\" you need a direct relative's MS implanted into you.",

Each time tho, there is no blood present. The only instance where there is blood present is when Obito and Sakura attempt to bring Sasuke through the amped Kamui Portal. Obito nearly falls over in exhaustion after this.\n\nMeanwhile Amaterasu seems to be the most damaging as blood is seen almost every time its used. I believe Kagutsuchi as well.\n\nI forget what happens with the MS Genjutsu's but I don't recall blood present with Itachi's Tsukuyomi but he seems tired af each time.

So for a successful sharingan transplant the sharingan eye has to be active and it would permanently stay active as long as the non uchiha has it. SPOILERS AHEAD. Mangekyou is awakened by witnessing the death of the person most dear to you. Kakashi killed rin, his last teammate to his knowledge. Obito also witnessed. They both awakened mangekyou sharingan \"MS\". For Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan \"EMS\" you need a direct relative's MS implanted into you.",

Each time tho, there is no blood present. The only instance where there is blood present is when Obito and Sakura attempt to bring Sasuke through the amped Kamui Portal. Obito nearly falls over in exhaustion after this.\n\nMeanwhile Amaterasu seems to be the most damaging as blood is seen almost every time its used. I believe Kagutsuchi as well.\n\nI forget what happens with the MS Genjutsu's but I don't recall blood present with Itachi's Tsukuyomi but he seems tired af each time.

So for a successful sharingan transplant the sharingan eye has to be active and it would permanently stay active as long as the non uchiha has it. SPOILERS AHEAD. Mangekyou is awakened by witnessing the death of the person most dear to you. Kakashi killed rin, his last teammate to his knowledge. Obito also witnessed. They both awakened mangekyou sharingan \"MS\". For Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan \"EMS\" you need a direct relative's MS implanted into you.",
