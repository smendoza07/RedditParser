My two other favorite from her (just off the top of my head) are when she came as a guest like two episodes before she became a member, and she was so frustrated with the challenge that she yelled that she wanted to kill everyone which was really extra for the moment. The other was when she and the other members getting the penalty for the Shuddering Package were driving into the field for wing-walking and she just threw out, \"well if we fall off the plane, as least we'll be easy to find.\" Who else would say that in such a tense situation other than our Jeon So-min? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",
