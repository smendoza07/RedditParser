Best wish for him in his recovery.\n\nDoes that mean RM filming will need to be halted? heck he is in so many shows in Korean Variety, I wonder what is going to happen.\n\nHope they practice certain protocols to slow the spread, even if it means less content for viewers. The recent rise in Covid19 cases in the entertainment industry is quite concerning.",

When questionable results came in, he called the staff, then he headed to the PCR Testing location where he was tested Positive.\n\nYJS taking extra precaution and not getting off the van at Running Man location literally saved entire RM cast and staff from Covid exposure and RM was able to film without YJS on 13th",
