That alone raised life expectancy you can tell that by narutos generation kids aren't in as much danger as warring states. It's slow progress and that's how peace usually works.",

Nobody pushed or instructed him to go die for hinata. This was the whole lesson that neji learnt since the beginning. To make his own choices. You're making up your own side of the story here.\n\nTake an example of a parent forcing his child to go to college and the child going to college out of his own interest. The end result is same but do those two scenarios mean the same?",

At least they had graduated the academy before being sent to war in the village system. The village system worked it just took time. In the village system Kids got better training then ever before. That alone raised life expectancy you can tell that by narutos generation kids aren't in as much danger as warring states. It's slow progress and that's how peace usually works.",

All tjose kids during the WS period were in potential of war, but not all clans were constantly fighting. For example maybe at one point in time the Uchiha, Senju, Aburame and Nara clans were all at war, but never would you have all of those + the Yamanaka + the Akimichi + the Sarutobi + etc. all in combat at the same time, also against a whole bunch of others.

That alone raised life expectancy you can tell that by narutos generation kids aren't in as much danger as warring states. It's slow progress and that's how peace usually works.",

Nobody pushed or instructed him to go die for hinata. This was the whole lesson that neji learnt since the beginning. To make his own choices. You're making up your own side of the story here.\n\nTake an example of a parent forcing his child to go to college and the child going to college out of his own interest. The end result is same but do those two scenarios mean the same?",

They were dying before they even became real ninjas during warring states. At least they had graduated the academy before being sent to war in the village system. The village system worked it just took time. In the village system Kids got better training then ever before. That alone raised life expectancy you can tell that by narutos generation kids aren't in as much danger as warring states. It's slow progress and that's how peace usually works.",

For example maybe at one point in time the Uchiha, Senju, Aburame and Nara clans were all at war, but never would you have all of those + the Yamanaka + the Akimichi + the Sarutobi + etc. all in combat at the same time, also against a whole bunch of others. But in the village system, when 1 went to war, everyone else was dragged in too. So **all** the kids end up fighting, instead of only some at a time.",
