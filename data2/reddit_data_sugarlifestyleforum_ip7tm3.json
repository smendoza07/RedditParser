            "body": "My thoughts:\n\n* You're obviously very pretty, but your pics all have this vacant expression, like maybe you were focusing on holding still or something. Swap in a candid with a smile, or a laugh. Just to bring some life to the image. Something in a more casual outfit could help too - so the SD gets a sense of both fancy date night you and casual night in you. \n* I that what you're doing in the first couple of lines of your \"about me\" is a stylistic choice, but it's not my favorite. It comes off like it's over produced. \n* The second paragraph can be cut - everything you say about yourself there is true of 99% of people. It's better to cut stuff that doesn't do much for your profile. Keep it concise and impactful. \n* I would instead flesh out a few of the details you mention. Being in graphic design is super cool. Maybe talk about a recent job you did that was interesting? Or you say you're into fitness - what's your favorite forms of exercise? Maybe the POT is into it too and you two can connect over that. Just add a little more texture to the details of who you are as a person - help the reader get to know you a bit. \n* Your \"why me\" is all kinda redundant and/or pointless. Clearly you are fit and wear tight dresses - your pics show that. And it's better to let them come to the conclusion that you're bubbly and fun instead of just stating that you are. \n* I would cut a couple of the tags, just focus on the few that are most important to you. \n* Your \"seeking\" could actually use a lot more information. Your description of what you're looking for in the SR and in the SD are incredibly vague - any SD who reads it is going to think he fits the bill. Add some details that are useful - like are you looking for regular weekly meetings? Wanting something short term? Do you care if the SD is single or not? Just add something that actually filters some people out, so it attracts the ones you do want. \n* The \"i want allowance from the start\" bit is difficult. I assume you know it's difficult, otherwise you wouldn't need to state it on your profile, but maybe explain why allowance immediately is important to you? Just to calm the reader - because it's a scammer red flag as is. \n* The whole thing about needing a voice/video call doesn't need to be on your profile itself, that should be brought up in messages with people. Putting it out in front makes you seem bossy/demanding/etc. Just a negative vibe. \n* Ditch the \"no time wasters\". No one will ever read that and think \"oh, I'm a time waster, guess I shouldn't message her\". It's not going to have any impact on the quality of men you get messages from and it leaves a bad taste in the mouth as a closing line.",

The profile text is mostly fine, too, but I have a few pet peeves I will share with you:  \n\n\n* It's odd to describe your appearance when everyone has already seen the photos. You're hot and exotic? I agree, but you really don't have to say it. Either the person viewing already feels that way or they don't. The recounting of it therefore adds little\n* Addressing \"time wasters\" is I think very pointless. Time wasters don't care about wasting your time; they live for it. People who aren't going to waste your time are unlikely to view your request to be left alone by time wasters with a skeptical eye or worse. It's basically a totally fair thing for you to want, but the mentioning of it is almost counter to what you desire\n\nYou're again super lovely and you're going to get a ton of attention. And I wish you nothing but great fortune in the bowl. I would suggest you share some of the things that make you nervous here at SLF. Maybe we can help lower that fear factor.\n\nBest to you!",

I have a couple of issues that pop out just for me (as opposed to more general feedback), and I will try and flag those.\n\nPhotos: Overall great - your beautiful and show it off along with your figure - so you cover the most important thing. If you can add a photo showing a smile, that would make it pop a bit more for me.\n\nAbout me: As I said - it's good. I prefer things that are less general (your first two paragraphs are quite general). More specifics would help - to build a connection  around (what sorts of things we could do together - I get art ... but beyond that?). There are a couple of style things - the bullets are a negative for me - but not a major one. As for the Meyers-Briggs ... meh. I find that needs more context rather than being something useful in a profile (this is a personal preference as well).\n\nSeeking: The biggest thing here - the admonition for time wasters. No one thinks of themselves that way and most who fit that description will not pay attention/read this far. Get rid of the negativity. The phone/video call may cost you a decent POT or two, but if it's important, that is probably worthwhile.",

I would contact you just based on that, but would hope you are also the type of woman I look for too.\n\nhere are a few notes about your profile...\n\n* Profile Tags - I tend to avoid women that use the LIFE of Leisure Tag. t says to me, you are looking to live entirely off of me and be dependent on me like a Trophy Wife\n* Photos - all of your photos have the model look that looks like you're an empty vessel, with no warmth, personality or soul. Throw in a few non model photos in more candid shots, and preferably at least 1or 2 with a smile.\n* ABOUT ME: Does a pretty good job of describing you and your personality, but hasn't really done anything to tell me as a SD what qualities are going to be desirable to him:. Things I look for (affectionate, sensual, romantic, fun loving, easy going, appreciative, etc)\n* SEEKING: This section should be used to describe the type of relationship we will have. You're profile neither implies or even makes reference to this being a physical relationship. We have no idea whether you're looking to be a platonic princess, have NSA hotel sex, be more like friends w/ benefits, or be a sugar girlfriend sugar relationship. If you're open to any or all of these things, it would be a good idea to mention which ones. If you're only open to one of these things, it would be an even better idea to mention which one specifically..!  A good Seeking section tells an SD exactly the type of SR you want, the types of connections preferred (emotional, mental, physical), it also gives us a window into what a SR might be with you. Be more descriptive.. will we be dancing the night away, and then running away on romantic weekends, will we be dinning out, and then whisking away to fancy hotels, or will we be spending days outdoors, then retiring inside to eat some good food by the fire, drinking wine together, having great conversations mixed in with copious amounts of flirting, and teasing...?\n\nI know many attractive women your age haven't really given it much thought what they can do to enhance a SD's life. Most attractive women haven't had to work on such things in their vanilla life, because 100's of thirsty guys on Dating Apps and Bars thrown themselves at her, so she hasn't had to give it much thought as to what she brings to the table, because her good looks or intelligence. My suggestion is to sit down and honestly assess yourself, what qualities do you possess that would be desirable to a man, especially a man with money that can have his choice of women because he's giving an allowance.",

But your pictures and profiles scream that I will be little more than an ATM.  That isn't good and won't work (emotionally) if you really are new and scared.  \n\n\nI am not going to tell you which picture to dump for it (maybe none) but I want 1 or 2 pictures of you being a goofball.  Drinking a pint with friends.  You cheering (without makeup) for M United  or whomever you like.    \n\n\nFOr the seeking you mention \"Exploring London\".  Well what?  Do you want your SD to take you on a pub crawl?  Kensington Gardens?  Walk the Themes at sunset?  Show you his favorite gallery at the Tate and explain to you why?   Take the train out to Greenwich for the day and spoil you over tea and then take you back to his flat and find out all the neat uses of cream and strawberries (you can leave that out).   And by telling him that (and then talking about it in chat) you can quickly start to screen the posers and bad actors from others.  \n\n\nAs others have said, you need to get rid of the allowance.  Others will have been words to suggest.  \n\n\nAs someone in search AND attracted to your type I would pass.  Something in the back of my mind would scream  that I would get eaten up, spit out, and never a glance back.  I( have been passing on MANY like this.  The challenge as a beautiful girl is showing that other side of you - if you DON\"T just want to be valued for your looks alone what else?  And if you can't answer this question just now  it isn't a problem.  Instead answer what do you hope to LEARN from an SD that further rounds you out?  \n\n\nHope this helps.

That isn't good and won't work (emotionally) if you really are new and scared.  \n\n\nI am not going to tell you which picture to dump for it (maybe none) but I want 1 or 2 pictures of you being a goofball.  Drinking a pint with friends.  You cheering (without makeup) for M United  or whomever you like.    \n\n\nFOr the seeking you mention \"Exploring London\".  Well what?  Do you want your SD to take you on a pub crawl?  Kensington Gardens?  Walk the Themes at sunset?  Show you his favorite gallery at the Tate and explain to you why?   Take the train out to Greenwich for the day and spoil you over tea and then take you back to his flat and find out all the neat uses of cream and strawberries (you can leave that out).   And by telling him that (and then talking about it in chat) you can quickly start to screen the posers and bad actors from others.  \n\n\nAs others have said, you need to get rid of the allowance.  Others will have been words to suggest.  \n\n\nAs someone in search AND attracted to your type I would pass.  Something in the back of my mind would scream  that I would get eaten up, spit out, and never a glance back.  I( have been passing on MANY like this.  The challenge as a beautiful girl is showing that other side of you - if you DON\"T just want to be valued for your looks alone what else?  And if you can't answer this question just now  it isn't a problem.  Instead answer what do you hope to LEARN from an SD that further rounds you out?  \n\n\nHope this helps.
