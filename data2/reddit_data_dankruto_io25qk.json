The current arc is anime-only but playing nice to setup and introduce the new villain group.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo matter what, I encourage you to read the manga. Ikemoto's style is a bit jarring at first, but you A. adapt to it and B. it actually improves immensely over time.

All but 3 or 4 of the Akatsuki were extremely shallow villains but people still like them. Orochimaru, the main villain of Part 1 was extremely shallow. While I agree that Boruto villains don't have as much depth as someone like Pain, none of these guys were ever meant to be long-term. Kara as an organization fell apart in like 15 chapters. We don't even know if Ishikki is the main villain yet.  \n\n\n> The other genin aren\u2019t involved in the story in any way except for shikadai being a plot device for amado to use. \n\nThe other genin doesn't matter in the manga and for good reason. They don't really add anything to the plot. The main cast of the manga (excluding the villains) includes Naruto, Sasuke, Boruto, Kawaki, Sarada, Mitsuki, Katasuke and Sumire. That's a good roundup. Why add 9 more to the mix?  \n\n\n> Its just one track for this weird alien plot. Which honestly i felt kaguya was the worst part of shippuden and they\u2019ve decided to make the entire plot of boruto revolve around more creatures like her \n\nKaguya was the worst part of Shippuden because she came out of literally nowhere and she was underdeveloped as a villain. The Otsutsuki clan in general came out of nowhere right at the end of Naruto so obviously it felt far-fetched. If the Otsutsuki clan was foreshadowed or even shown since the beginning of Naruto the I guarantee that it wouldn't have been as big of a problem. This is exactly what Boruto is doing, instead of coming up with an asspull alien clan out of nowhere, it actually *expands* upon it from the beginning of the series to make it an actually fleshed out plot point.",

We got his whole story, and a rich personality through his interactions and they continued to build on him after his main arc. \n\nBoro is dead. What we got, which is nothing, is all we get. \n\nI don\u2019t think kara has been presented as just some small irrelevant group. So thats why i\u2019m frustrated with it falling apart in 15 chapters. If it turns out that theres another better organization going to emerge thats cool but they better be introduced and handled better than these guys.\n\nAs far as the other genin go i just feel that taking over the naruto world to tell a story and then not making use of any but the least amount of characters in it is kinda unfortunate. The world is really amazing and a lot of characters with great potential are going to waste in both the manga and \u201cexpanded\u201d anime. \n\nThe ootsuki is fundamentally a silly idea imo. And adding more ootsuki just introduces more plotholes. Isshki was chilling since the time kaguya got to earth apparently. If the story develops the ootsuki they introduce in a good way i\u2019m open to change my mind about them. But right now isshki is empty as hell too. He\u2019s so goddamn boring man. He gets interesting fights but his interactions are boring as fuck. Even though we know he has some history with kaguya, we don\u2019t know what he intends on doing  when he gets kawakis body or anything about him aside from that. So its hard for me to be attached to him in anyway but slight curiosity. Urashiki as the other ootsuki in the anime was the worst written character i\u2019ve probably ever seen. And momoshiki so far has been shallow as fuck too. We don\u2019t know what his goals were expect that these ootsuki are all parasites who want chakra.",

He didn\u2019t want to, he helped no one, was a shady bastard and enemy even at the end, so why is everyone cool with him now? What made them think he wouldn\u2019t do his same shit again? Absolutely nothing. Having Kakashi, Naruto, Sasuke, and Tsunade of all people even _want_ him living - _in Konoha of all places_ is beyond stupid and seems to have happened for no real reason, you know? \nJust like I find the premise of chasing down Sasuke in Shippuden being kinda pointless and nonsensical, I find other actions taken by certain characters to be strange or not make sense. Sasuke spends several years outside the village, even after making a family, and I find that so strange from a person who valued family over everything else. \u201cWe chased you down for leaving the village for years, and we want you to serve us by leaving the village for years\u201d/\u201cI want to redeem myself from living the village by leaving the village - I promise I\u2019ll come back this time!\u201d Honestly, Sasuke\u2019s character is rather badly handled since Shippuden, but that\u2019s another problem. I\u2019m pretty sure that he legit spent more years _outside_ of Konoha than he ever did in it, at that point. \nThere is also more pointless parental drama in my opinion, like Boruto being a spoiled angsty brat because Naruto isn\u2019t home much or something, Sarada doubting Sakura as her mother, and the estrangement between her and her father. I find that very annoying. \nI also don\u2019t like how the fact that there is a lot of \u201cnostalgia\u201d traps in Boruto the characters go back into their parents\u2018 time, as it seems like a cheap effort to bring in the old fans like clickbait rather than having an actual story. Time travel plot points are very hard to handle well, and are largely pointless when done like that (because the past can\u2019t _actually_ changed, so it\u2019s more of a prolonged method to making Boruto understand his father).\nThe bigger villains (from what I\u2019ve understood so far, which isn\u2019t much, so I\u2019m likely wrong in some areas) feels more like a stretched out problem from villains that were already starting to seem ridiculous at the end of Shippuden, so it feels more like a fabricated problem than a problem organic to the time period Boruto is set up in itself.",

The anime right now is still pushing out \"anime canon\" because they dont want to get too ahead of the manga, leading to some of the problems you have mentioned such as the unnecessarily time travel arc. The manga however does have a really good plot that actually seems to pick up after the events of shippuden. Along with this the fights in the manga seemed to be leaning more towards the tactical fighting style from the original naruto rather than the Rasengan spam of Shippuden. So if you haven't tried the manga yet, give it a chance, it releases every month and the tensions are just rising in the latest chapters (New chapter Sept 18).",

As a result, I only really read short manga. I can\u2019t read longer manga long term, as much as I\u2019d like to.\n\nI don\u2019t think I can care enough about Boruto to try either way, because after all, aren\u2019t most of the points I still made (beside the time travel stuff, I guess) still true for the manga as well? Or is the premise really so different?\n\nI have heard that the best part about Boruto is the manga, so I\u2019ll at least look at places like the wiki to find details as to why.\n\nThank you for taking the time to respond, though!

The story more focuses on the otsutsuki and the special mark that you see one of them put on boruto. The story feels like its nearing the point where it does a time skip, which we know is bound to happen because of the part in the beginning. The first few chapter can be slow but once it picks up the pace it really doesn't slow down. I can go a bit more into detail if you like but it would probably be going into light spoiler territory. As for eye strain I reccomend trying to read it on a phone or pc (tachiyomi for android, mangadex for pc) with a blue light filter on. I hope I can convince you to read it because the story is honestly enticing and I hate having to wait a month between chapters.",

I had no idea that the story could be so different, that\u2019s kinda strange, but interesting, honestly.\n\nPersonally, part of the eye strain is picking up all the many small details drawn for a manga panel along with following/\u201cinducing\u201d movement for action and fighting scenes, so putting them on a smaller screen would make it harder for me to figure what\u2019s going on. Things being in black and white make my eyes work harder to differentiate things, as well. It\u2019s why I like anime better - not only can the movement and color be a marvel in and of itself, I feel like I can follow what\u2019s happening much better and feel way more engaged with the story, especially with the addition of sound. Shounen in particular is one of those things that benefit more in execution in animation than 2D, in my opinion. It can just suck when an anime doesn\u2019t properly do it\u2019s manga justice, so it can\u2019t serve as a proper alternative medium for you to understand the story.\n\nI\u2019ll try to mess with my laptop\u2019s lighting to see if that helps any, and it\u2019ll definitely take me a while to go though, but I can at least try to read some of it.\nI really appreciate the suggestions!",

                                                    "body": "Again, did you watch the series? How do you not know that Boruto being a brat *was the point*? How do you not know that him having everything was *intentional*? You are missing the point of his character arc.\n\nI\u2019ll quote myself here;\n\n\u201cThe point is that Boruto\u2019s character arc is maturity. For the first 5~ chapters, Boruto starts off as some brat who had everything. A good family, skill in combat, friends, everything he could have wanted for a boy his age. He even stated this himself in the [first chapter](https://cdn.mangaeden.com/mangasimg/9e/9e2cf3139bb524293f45959c91c95f1b9ca399d3c8e00b9dd4281046.png). But, the one thing that he didn\u2019t have was a father. For most, this issue would be as simple as just creating a plan for your dad to come home more often, but, instead Boruto goes out of his way to *cheat* on the one test that actually mattered in his ninja career to get attention from him. This introduces a major character flaw for Boruto; he\u2019s cocky and therefore overconfident. He thinks he\u2019s figured everything out because of what he\u2019s been gifted.\n\nObviously, after the end of the Chunin exams, Boruto matures a *little bit* by learning of his father\u2019s experiences and what it really means to be a ninja, but that isn\u2019t the end of his journey. It doesn\u2019t solve his core issue of *overconfidence*.  He is still immature.\n\nBecause of Boruto\u2019s overconfidence in himself, he accepted the rasengan against Momoshiki which ultimately gave him the [Kama Seal](https://preview.redd.it/3bm4c8x9oav11.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=32194b13e99071cd41889a2ef45c99712549a9b0). As a character, this moment is HUGE since it shows how his overconfidence in himself will one day take everything from him. It\u2019s at this point when Boruto begins to get *consequences* for his selfish actions.\n\nIn the latest chapter, Boruto uses his Kama seal to teleport through dimensions. He gloats about this to Naruto and Sasuke, but, as we know now, this only furthers the process of Momoshiki\u2019s reincarnation into Boruto through the Kama. His actions will have consequences. He will lose everything.\n\nIt is because of Boruto *begging* to go with Naruto and Sasuke in the fight against Ishikki that one of them will inevitably die because of him losing control of his [Borushiki State](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ERXcSmbUwAEdqdZ.jpg).\n\nAnd, it is because of Boruto thinking that he could do something against Delta that Kawaki lost an arm.\n\nBecause of Boruto\u2019s major character flaw, Boruto will lose everything that he holds dear to him. Everything that he once had. His family, his friends, and even being able to call himself a ninja, and THAT is how Boruto will finally be able to mature past who he was. Boruto will mature through *loss*, like we saw in this flash forward [here](https://i2.wp.com/animehunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Boruto-Teen.jpg?fit=740%2C416&ssl=1).\n\nIn a sense, you could say that Boruto is an exact opposite of Naruto, which makes him an extremely unique protagonist, and dare I say one of the best of the new generation.\u201d",

All but 3 or 4 of the Akatsuki were extremely shallow villains but people still like them. Orochimaru, the main villain of Part 1 was extremely shallow. While I agree that Boruto villains don't have as much depth as someone like Pain, none of these guys were ever meant to be long-term. Kara as an organization fell apart in like 15 chapters. We don't even know if Ishikki is the main villain yet.  \n\n\n> The other genin aren\u2019t involved in the story in any way except for shikadai being a plot device for amado to use. \n\nThe other genin doesn't matter in the manga and for good reason. They don't really add anything to the plot. The main cast of the manga (excluding the villains) includes Naruto, Sasuke, Boruto, Kawaki, Sarada, Mitsuki, Katasuke and Sumire. That's a good roundup. Why add 9 more to the mix?  \n\n\n> Its just one track for this weird alien plot. Which honestly i felt kaguya was the worst part of shippuden and they\u2019ve decided to make the entire plot of boruto revolve around more creatures like her \n\nKaguya was the worst part of Shippuden because she came out of literally nowhere and she was underdeveloped as a villain. The Otsutsuki clan in general came out of nowhere right at the end of Naruto so obviously it felt far-fetched. If the Otsutsuki clan was foreshadowed or even shown since the beginning of Naruto the I guarantee that it wouldn't have been as big of a problem. This is exactly what Boruto is doing, instead of coming up with an asspull alien clan out of nowhere, it actually *expands* upon it from the beginning of the series to make it an actually fleshed out plot point.",

We got his whole story, and a rich personality through his interactions and they continued to build on him after his main arc. \n\nBoro is dead. What we got, which is nothing, is all we get. \n\nI don\u2019t think kara has been presented as just some small irrelevant group. So thats why i\u2019m frustrated with it falling apart in 15 chapters. If it turns out that theres another better organization going to emerge thats cool but they better be introduced and handled better than these guys.\n\nAs far as the other genin go i just feel that taking over the naruto world to tell a story and then not making use of any but the least amount of characters in it is kinda unfortunate. The world is really amazing and a lot of characters with great potential are going to waste in both the manga and \u201cexpanded\u201d anime. \n\nThe ootsuki is fundamentally a silly idea imo. And adding more ootsuki just introduces more plotholes. Isshki was chilling since the time kaguya got to earth apparently. If the story develops the ootsuki they introduce in a good way i\u2019m open to change my mind about them. But right now isshki is empty as hell too. He\u2019s so goddamn boring man. He gets interesting fights but his interactions are boring as fuck. Even though we know he has some history with kaguya, we don\u2019t know what he intends on doing  when he gets kawakis body or anything about him aside from that. So its hard for me to be attached to him in anyway but slight curiosity. Urashiki as the other ootsuki in the anime was the worst written character i\u2019ve probably ever seen. And momoshiki so far has been shallow as fuck too. We don\u2019t know what his goals were expect that these ootsuki are all parasites who want chakra.",

He didn\u2019t want to, he helped no one, was a shady bastard and enemy even at the end, so why is everyone cool with him now? What made them think he wouldn\u2019t do his same shit again? Absolutely nothing. Having Kakashi, Naruto, Sasuke, and Tsunade of all people even _want_ him living - _in Konoha of all places_ is beyond stupid and seems to have happened for no real reason, you know? \nJust like I find the premise of chasing down Sasuke in Shippuden being kinda pointless and nonsensical, I find other actions taken by certain characters to be strange or not make sense. Sasuke spends several years outside the village, even after making a family, and I find that so strange from a person who valued family over everything else. \u201cWe chased you down for leaving the village for years, and we want you to serve us by leaving the village for years\u201d/\u201cI want to redeem myself from living the village by leaving the village - I promise I\u2019ll come back this time!\u201d Honestly, Sasuke\u2019s character is rather badly handled since Shippuden, but that\u2019s another problem. I\u2019m pretty sure that he legit spent more years _outside_ of Konoha than he ever did in it, at that point. \nThere is also more pointless parental drama in my opinion, like Boruto being a spoiled angsty brat because Naruto isn\u2019t home much or something, Sarada doubting Sakura as her mother, and the estrangement between her and her father. I find that very annoying. \nI also don\u2019t like how the fact that there is a lot of \u201cnostalgia\u201d traps in Boruto the characters go back into their parents\u2018 time, as it seems like a cheap effort to bring in the old fans like clickbait rather than having an actual story. Time travel plot points are very hard to handle well, and are largely pointless when done like that (because the past can\u2019t _actually_ changed, so it\u2019s more of a prolonged method to making Boruto understand his father).\nThe bigger villains (from what I\u2019ve understood so far, which isn\u2019t much, so I\u2019m likely wrong in some areas) feels more like a stretched out problem from villains that were already starting to seem ridiculous at the end of Shippuden, so it feels more like a fabricated problem than a problem organic to the time period Boruto is set up in itself.",

The anime right now is still pushing out \"anime canon\" because they dont want to get too ahead of the manga, leading to some of the problems you have mentioned such as the unnecessarily time travel arc. The manga however does have a really good plot that actually seems to pick up after the events of shippuden. Along with this the fights in the manga seemed to be leaning more towards the tactical fighting style from the original naruto rather than the Rasengan spam of Shippuden. So if you haven't tried the manga yet, give it a chance, it releases every month and the tensions are just rising in the latest chapters (New chapter Sept 18).",

I can\u2019t read longer manga long term, as much as I\u2019d like to.\n\nI don\u2019t think I can care enough about Boruto to try either way, because after all, aren\u2019t most of the points I still made (beside the time travel stuff, I guess) still true for the manga as well? Or is the premise really so different?\n\nI have heard that the best part about Boruto is the manga, so I\u2019ll at least look at places like the wiki to find details as to why.\n\nThank you for taking the time to respond, though!

The story more focuses on the otsutsuki and the special mark that you see one of them put on boruto. The story feels like its nearing the point where it does a time skip, which we know is bound to happen because of the part in the beginning. The first few chapter can be slow but once it picks up the pace it really doesn't slow down. I can go a bit more into detail if you like but it would probably be going into light spoiler territory. As for eye strain I reccomend trying to read it on a phone or pc (tachiyomi for android, mangadex for pc) with a blue light filter on. I hope I can convince you to read it because the story is honestly enticing and I hate having to wait a month between chapters.",

I had no idea that the story could be so different, that\u2019s kinda strange, but interesting, honestly.\n\nPersonally, part of the eye strain is picking up all the many small details drawn for a manga panel along with following/\u201cinducing\u201d movement for action and fighting scenes, so putting them on a smaller screen would make it harder for me to figure what\u2019s going on. Things being in black and white make my eyes work harder to differentiate things, as well. It\u2019s why I like anime better - not only can the movement and color be a marvel in and of itself, I feel like I can follow what\u2019s happening much better and feel way more engaged with the story, especially with the addition of sound. Shounen in particular is one of those things that benefit more in execution in animation than 2D, in my opinion. It can just suck when an anime doesn\u2019t properly do it\u2019s manga justice, so it can\u2019t serve as a proper alternative medium for you to understand the story.\n\nI\u2019ll try to mess with my laptop\u2019s lighting to see if that helps any, and it\u2019ll definitely take me a while to go though, but I can at least try to read some of it.\nI really appreciate the suggestions!",

                                            "body": "Again, did you watch the series? How do you not know that Boruto being a brat *was the point*? How do you not know that him having everything was *intentional*? You are missing the point of his character arc.\n\nI\u2019ll quote myself here;\n\n\u201cThe point is that Boruto\u2019s character arc is maturity. For the first 5~ chapters, Boruto starts off as some brat who had everything. A good family, skill in combat, friends, everything he could have wanted for a boy his age. He even stated this himself in the [first chapter](https://cdn.mangaeden.com/mangasimg/9e/9e2cf3139bb524293f45959c91c95f1b9ca399d3c8e00b9dd4281046.png). But, the one thing that he didn\u2019t have was a father. For most, this issue would be as simple as just creating a plan for your dad to come home more often, but, instead Boruto goes out of his way to *cheat* on the one test that actually mattered in his ninja career to get attention from him. This introduces a major character flaw for Boruto; he\u2019s cocky and therefore overconfident. He thinks he\u2019s figured everything out because of what he\u2019s been gifted.\n\nObviously, after the end of the Chunin exams, Boruto matures a *little bit* by learning of his father\u2019s experiences and what it really means to be a ninja, but that isn\u2019t the end of his journey. It doesn\u2019t solve his core issue of *overconfidence*.  He is still immature.\n\nBecause of Boruto\u2019s overconfidence in himself, he accepted the rasengan against Momoshiki which ultimately gave him the [Kama Seal](https://preview.redd.it/3bm4c8x9oav11.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=32194b13e99071cd41889a2ef45c99712549a9b0). As a character, this moment is HUGE since it shows how his overconfidence in himself will one day take everything from him. It\u2019s at this point when Boruto begins to get *consequences* for his selfish actions.\n\nIn the latest chapter, Boruto uses his Kama seal to teleport through dimensions. He gloats about this to Naruto and Sasuke, but, as we know now, this only furthers the process of Momoshiki\u2019s reincarnation into Boruto through the Kama. His actions will have consequences. He will lose everything.\n\nIt is because of Boruto *begging* to go with Naruto and Sasuke in the fight against Ishikki that one of them will inevitably die because of him losing control of his [Borushiki State](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ERXcSmbUwAEdqdZ.jpg).\n\nAnd, it is because of Boruto thinking that he could do something against Delta that Kawaki lost an arm.\n\nBecause of Boruto\u2019s major character flaw, Boruto will lose everything that he holds dear to him. Everything that he once had. His family, his friends, and even being able to call himself a ninja, and THAT is how Boruto will finally be able to mature past who he was. Boruto will mature through *loss*, like we saw in this flash forward [here](https://i2.wp.com/animehunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Boruto-Teen.jpg?fit=740%2C416&ssl=1).\n\nIn a sense, you could say that Boruto is an exact opposite of Naruto, which makes him an extremely unique protagonist, and dare I say one of the best of the new generation.\u201d",

All but 3 or 4 of the Akatsuki were extremely shallow villains but people still like them. Orochimaru, the main villain of Part 1 was extremely shallow. While I agree that Boruto villains don't have as much depth as someone like Pain, none of these guys were ever meant to be long-term. Kara as an organization fell apart in like 15 chapters. We don't even know if Ishikki is the main villain yet.  \n\n\n> The other genin aren\u2019t involved in the story in any way except for shikadai being a plot device for amado to use. \n\nThe other genin doesn't matter in the manga and for good reason. They don't really add anything to the plot. The main cast of the manga (excluding the villains) includes Naruto, Sasuke, Boruto, Kawaki, Sarada, Mitsuki, Katasuke and Sumire. That's a good roundup. Why add 9 more to the mix?  \n\n\n> Its just one track for this weird alien plot. Which honestly i felt kaguya was the worst part of shippuden and they\u2019ve decided to make the entire plot of boruto revolve around more creatures like her \n\nKaguya was the worst part of Shippuden because she came out of literally nowhere and she was underdeveloped as a villain. The Otsutsuki clan in general came out of nowhere right at the end of Naruto so obviously it felt far-fetched. If the Otsutsuki clan was foreshadowed or even shown since the beginning of Naruto the I guarantee that it wouldn't have been as big of a problem. This is exactly what Boruto is doing, instead of coming up with an asspull alien clan out of nowhere, it actually *expands* upon it from the beginning of the series to make it an actually fleshed out plot point.",

We got his whole story, and a rich personality through his interactions and they continued to build on him after his main arc. \n\nBoro is dead. What we got, which is nothing, is all we get. \n\nI don\u2019t think kara has been presented as just some small irrelevant group. So thats why i\u2019m frustrated with it falling apart in 15 chapters. If it turns out that theres another better organization going to emerge thats cool but they better be introduced and handled better than these guys.\n\nAs far as the other genin go i just feel that taking over the naruto world to tell a story and then not making use of any but the least amount of characters in it is kinda unfortunate. The world is really amazing and a lot of characters with great potential are going to waste in both the manga and \u201cexpanded\u201d anime. \n\nThe ootsuki is fundamentally a silly idea imo. And adding more ootsuki just introduces more plotholes. Isshki was chilling since the time kaguya got to earth apparently. If the story develops the ootsuki they introduce in a good way i\u2019m open to change my mind about them. But right now isshki is empty as hell too. He\u2019s so goddamn boring man. He gets interesting fights but his interactions are boring as fuck. Even though we know he has some history with kaguya, we don\u2019t know what he intends on doing  when he gets kawakis body or anything about him aside from that. So its hard for me to be attached to him in anyway but slight curiosity. Urashiki as the other ootsuki in the anime was the worst written character i\u2019ve probably ever seen. And momoshiki so far has been shallow as fuck too. We don\u2019t know what his goals were expect that these ootsuki are all parasites who want chakra.",

He didn\u2019t want to, he helped no one, was a shady bastard and enemy even at the end, so why is everyone cool with him now? What made them think he wouldn\u2019t do his same shit again? Absolutely nothing. Having Kakashi, Naruto, Sasuke, and Tsunade of all people even _want_ him living - _in Konoha of all places_ is beyond stupid and seems to have happened for no real reason, you know? \nJust like I find the premise of chasing down Sasuke in Shippuden being kinda pointless and nonsensical, I find other actions taken by certain characters to be strange or not make sense. Sasuke spends several years outside the village, even after making a family, and I find that so strange from a person who valued family over everything else. \u201cWe chased you down for leaving the village for years, and we want you to serve us by leaving the village for years\u201d/\u201cI want to redeem myself from living the village by leaving the village - I promise I\u2019ll come back this time!\u201d Honestly, Sasuke\u2019s character is rather badly handled since Shippuden, but that\u2019s another problem. I\u2019m pretty sure that he legit spent more years _outside_ of Konoha than he ever did in it, at that point. \nThere is also more pointless parental drama in my opinion, like Boruto being a spoiled angsty brat because Naruto isn\u2019t home much or something, Sarada doubting Sakura as her mother, and the estrangement between her and her father. I find that very annoying. \nI also don\u2019t like how the fact that there is a lot of \u201cnostalgia\u201d traps in Boruto the characters go back into their parents\u2018 time, as it seems like a cheap effort to bring in the old fans like clickbait rather than having an actual story. Time travel plot points are very hard to handle well, and are largely pointless when done like that (because the past can\u2019t _actually_ changed, so it\u2019s more of a prolonged method to making Boruto understand his father).\nThe bigger villains (from what I\u2019ve understood so far, which isn\u2019t much, so I\u2019m likely wrong in some areas) feels more like a stretched out problem from villains that were already starting to seem ridiculous at the end of Shippuden, so it feels more like a fabricated problem than a problem organic to the time period Boruto is set up in itself.",

The anime right now is still pushing out \"anime canon\" because they dont want to get too ahead of the manga, leading to some of the problems you have mentioned such as the unnecessarily time travel arc. The manga however does have a really good plot that actually seems to pick up after the events of shippuden. Along with this the fights in the manga seemed to be leaning more towards the tactical fighting style from the original naruto rather than the Rasengan spam of Shippuden. So if you haven't tried the manga yet, give it a chance, it releases every month and the tensions are just rising in the latest chapters (New chapter Sept 18).",

The story more focuses on the otsutsuki and the special mark that you see one of them put on boruto. The story feels like its nearing the point where it does a time skip, which we know is bound to happen because of the part in the beginning. The first few chapter can be slow but once it picks up the pace it really doesn't slow down. I can go a bit more into detail if you like but it would probably be going into light spoiler territory. As for eye strain I reccomend trying to read it on a phone or pc (tachiyomi for android, mangadex for pc) with a blue light filter on. I hope I can convince you to read it because the story is honestly enticing and I hate having to wait a month between chapters.",

I had no idea that the story could be so different, that\u2019s kinda strange, but interesting, honestly.\n\nPersonally, part of the eye strain is picking up all the many small details drawn for a manga panel along with following/\u201cinducing\u201d movement for action and fighting scenes, so putting them on a smaller screen would make it harder for me to figure what\u2019s going on. Things being in black and white make my eyes work harder to differentiate things, as well. It\u2019s why I like anime better - not only can the movement and color be a marvel in and of itself, I feel like I can follow what\u2019s happening much better and feel way more engaged with the story, especially with the addition of sound. Shounen in particular is one of those things that benefit more in execution in animation than 2D, in my opinion. It can just suck when an anime doesn\u2019t properly do it\u2019s manga justice, so it can\u2019t serve as a proper alternative medium for you to understand the story.\n\nI\u2019ll try to mess with my laptop\u2019s lighting to see if that helps any, and it\u2019ll definitely take me a while to go though, but I can at least try to read some of it.\nI really appreciate the suggestions!",

                                    "body": "Again, did you watch the series? How do you not know that Boruto being a brat *was the point*? How do you not know that him having everything was *intentional*? You are missing the point of his character arc.\n\nI\u2019ll quote myself here;\n\n\u201cThe point is that Boruto\u2019s character arc is maturity. For the first 5~ chapters, Boruto starts off as some brat who had everything. A good family, skill in combat, friends, everything he could have wanted for a boy his age. He even stated this himself in the [first chapter](https://cdn.mangaeden.com/mangasimg/9e/9e2cf3139bb524293f45959c91c95f1b9ca399d3c8e00b9dd4281046.png). But, the one thing that he didn\u2019t have was a father. For most, this issue would be as simple as just creating a plan for your dad to come home more often, but, instead Boruto goes out of his way to *cheat* on the one test that actually mattered in his ninja career to get attention from him. This introduces a major character flaw for Boruto; he\u2019s cocky and therefore overconfident. He thinks he\u2019s figured everything out because of what he\u2019s been gifted.\n\nObviously, after the end of the Chunin exams, Boruto matures a *little bit* by learning of his father\u2019s experiences and what it really means to be a ninja, but that isn\u2019t the end of his journey. It doesn\u2019t solve his core issue of *overconfidence*.  He is still immature.\n\nBecause of Boruto\u2019s overconfidence in himself, he accepted the rasengan against Momoshiki which ultimately gave him the [Kama Seal](https://preview.redd.it/3bm4c8x9oav11.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=32194b13e99071cd41889a2ef45c99712549a9b0). As a character, this moment is HUGE since it shows how his overconfidence in himself will one day take everything from him. It\u2019s at this point when Boruto begins to get *consequences* for his selfish actions.\n\nIn the latest chapter, Boruto uses his Kama seal to teleport through dimensions. He gloats about this to Naruto and Sasuke, but, as we know now, this only furthers the process of Momoshiki\u2019s reincarnation into Boruto through the Kama. His actions will have consequences. He will lose everything.\n\nIt is because of Boruto *begging* to go with Naruto and Sasuke in the fight against Ishikki that one of them will inevitably die because of him losing control of his [Borushiki State](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ERXcSmbUwAEdqdZ.jpg).\n\nAnd, it is because of Boruto thinking that he could do something against Delta that Kawaki lost an arm.\n\nBecause of Boruto\u2019s major character flaw, Boruto will lose everything that he holds dear to him. Everything that he once had. His family, his friends, and even being able to call himself a ninja, and THAT is how Boruto will finally be able to mature past who he was. Boruto will mature through *loss*, like we saw in this flash forward [here](https://i2.wp.com/animehunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Boruto-Teen.jpg?fit=740%2C416&ssl=1).\n\nIn a sense, you could say that Boruto is an exact opposite of Naruto, which makes him an extremely unique protagonist, and dare I say one of the best of the new generation.\u201d",

All but 3 or 4 of the Akatsuki were extremely shallow villains but people still like them. Orochimaru, the main villain of Part 1 was extremely shallow. While I agree that Boruto villains don't have as much depth as someone like Pain, none of these guys were ever meant to be long-term. Kara as an organization fell apart in like 15 chapters. We don't even know if Ishikki is the main villain yet.  \n\n\n> The other genin aren\u2019t involved in the story in any way except for shikadai being a plot device for amado to use. \n\nThe other genin doesn't matter in the manga and for good reason. They don't really add anything to the plot. The main cast of the manga (excluding the villains) includes Naruto, Sasuke, Boruto, Kawaki, Sarada, Mitsuki, Katasuke and Sumire. That's a good roundup. Why add 9 more to the mix?  \n\n\n> Its just one track for this weird alien plot. Which honestly i felt kaguya was the worst part of shippuden and they\u2019ve decided to make the entire plot of boruto revolve around more creatures like her \n\nKaguya was the worst part of Shippuden because she came out of literally nowhere and she was underdeveloped as a villain. The Otsutsuki clan in general came out of nowhere right at the end of Naruto so obviously it felt far-fetched. If the Otsutsuki clan was foreshadowed or even shown since the beginning of Naruto the I guarantee that it wouldn't have been as big of a problem. This is exactly what Boruto is doing, instead of coming up with an asspull alien clan out of nowhere, it actually *expands* upon it from the beginning of the series to make it an actually fleshed out plot point.",

We got his whole story, and a rich personality through his interactions and they continued to build on him after his main arc. \n\nBoro is dead. What we got, which is nothing, is all we get. \n\nI don\u2019t think kara has been presented as just some small irrelevant group. So thats why i\u2019m frustrated with it falling apart in 15 chapters. If it turns out that theres another better organization going to emerge thats cool but they better be introduced and handled better than these guys.\n\nAs far as the other genin go i just feel that taking over the naruto world to tell a story and then not making use of any but the least amount of characters in it is kinda unfortunate. The world is really amazing and a lot of characters with great potential are going to waste in both the manga and \u201cexpanded\u201d anime. \n\nThe ootsuki is fundamentally a silly idea imo. And adding more ootsuki just introduces more plotholes. Isshki was chilling since the time kaguya got to earth apparently. If the story develops the ootsuki they introduce in a good way i\u2019m open to change my mind about them. But right now isshki is empty as hell too. He\u2019s so goddamn boring man. He gets interesting fights but his interactions are boring as fuck. Even though we know he has some history with kaguya, we don\u2019t know what he intends on doing  when he gets kawakis body or anything about him aside from that. So its hard for me to be attached to him in anyway but slight curiosity. Urashiki as the other ootsuki in the anime was the worst written character i\u2019ve probably ever seen. And momoshiki so far has been shallow as fuck too. We don\u2019t know what his goals were expect that these ootsuki are all parasites who want chakra.",

            "body": "My problem is that certain premises of Boruto kind of relies on downplaying or ignoring important values of Naruto itself, and that it feels like a desperate cash grab than something written out of actual love and care for the universe. \nOne of the things I find most unforgivable is that Orochimaru is just chilling in the village with a literal test tube baby when the very reason he was hunted down for 30+ was experimenting on children, and he didn\u2019t even \u201credeem\u201d himself at the end like Obito and Madara did. He didn\u2019t want to, he helped no one, was a shady bastard and enemy even at the end, so why is everyone cool with him now? What made them think he wouldn\u2019t do his same shit again? Absolutely nothing. Having Kakashi, Naruto, Sasuke, and Tsunade of all people even _want_ him living - _in Konoha of all places_ is beyond stupid and seems to have happened for no real reason, you know? \nJust like I find the premise of chasing down Sasuke in Shippuden being kinda pointless and nonsensical, I find other actions taken by certain characters to be strange or not make sense. Sasuke spends several years outside the village, even after making a family, and I find that so strange from a person who valued family over everything else. \u201cWe chased you down for leaving the village for years, and we want you to serve us by leaving the village for years\u201d/\u201cI want to redeem myself from living the village by leaving the village - I promise I\u2019ll come back this time!\u201d Honestly, Sasuke\u2019s character is rather badly handled since Shippuden, but that\u2019s another problem. I\u2019m pretty sure that he legit spent more years _outside_ of Konoha than he ever did in it, at that point. \nThere is also more pointless parental drama in my opinion, like Boruto being a spoiled angsty brat because Naruto isn\u2019t home much or something, Sarada doubting Sakura as her mother, and the estrangement between her and her father. I find that very annoying. \nI also don\u2019t like how the fact that there is a lot of \u201cnostalgia\u201d traps in Boruto the characters go back into their parents\u2018 time, as it seems like a cheap effort to bring in the old fans like clickbait rather than having an actual story. Time travel plot points are very hard to handle well, and are largely pointless when done like that (because the past can\u2019t _actually_ changed, so it\u2019s more of a prolonged method to making Boruto understand his father).\nThe bigger villains (from what I\u2019ve understood so far, which isn\u2019t much, so I\u2019m likely wrong in some areas) feels more like a stretched out problem from villains that were already starting to seem ridiculous at the end of Shippuden, so it feels more like a fabricated problem than a problem organic to the time period Boruto is set up in itself.",

The anime right now is still pushing out \"anime canon\" because they dont want to get too ahead of the manga, leading to some of the problems you have mentioned such as the unnecessarily time travel arc. The manga however does have a really good plot that actually seems to pick up after the events of shippuden. Along with this the fights in the manga seemed to be leaning more towards the tactical fighting style from the original naruto rather than the Rasengan spam of Shippuden. So if you haven't tried the manga yet, give it a chance, it releases every month and the tensions are just rising in the latest chapters (New chapter Sept 18).",

The story more focuses on the otsutsuki and the special mark that you see one of them put on boruto. The story feels like its nearing the point where it does a time skip, which we know is bound to happen because of the part in the beginning. The first few chapter can be slow but once it picks up the pace it really doesn't slow down. I can go a bit more into detail if you like but it would probably be going into light spoiler territory. As for eye strain I reccomend trying to read it on a phone or pc (tachiyomi for android, mangadex for pc) with a blue light filter on. I hope I can convince you to read it because the story is honestly enticing and I hate having to wait a month between chapters.",

I had no idea that the story could be so different, that\u2019s kinda strange, but interesting, honestly.\n\nPersonally, part of the eye strain is picking up all the many small details drawn for a manga panel along with following/\u201cinducing\u201d movement for action and fighting scenes, so putting them on a smaller screen would make it harder for me to figure what\u2019s going on. Things being in black and white make my eyes work harder to differentiate things, as well. It\u2019s why I like anime better - not only can the movement and color be a marvel in and of itself, I feel like I can follow what\u2019s happening much better and feel way more engaged with the story, especially with the addition of sound. Shounen in particular is one of those things that benefit more in execution in animation than 2D, in my opinion. It can just suck when an anime doesn\u2019t properly do it\u2019s manga justice, so it can\u2019t serve as a proper alternative medium for you to understand the story.\n\nI\u2019ll try to mess with my laptop\u2019s lighting to see if that helps any, and it\u2019ll definitely take me a while to go though, but I can at least try to read some of it.\nI really appreciate the suggestions!",

                            "body": "Again, did you watch the series? How do you not know that Boruto being a brat *was the point*? How do you not know that him having everything was *intentional*? You are missing the point of his character arc.\n\nI\u2019ll quote myself here;\n\n\u201cThe point is that Boruto\u2019s character arc is maturity. For the first 5~ chapters, Boruto starts off as some brat who had everything. A good family, skill in combat, friends, everything he could have wanted for a boy his age. He even stated this himself in the [first chapter](https://cdn.mangaeden.com/mangasimg/9e/9e2cf3139bb524293f45959c91c95f1b9ca399d3c8e00b9dd4281046.png). But, the one thing that he didn\u2019t have was a father. For most, this issue would be as simple as just creating a plan for your dad to come home more often, but, instead Boruto goes out of his way to *cheat* on the one test that actually mattered in his ninja career to get attention from him. This introduces a major character flaw for Boruto; he\u2019s cocky and therefore overconfident. He thinks he\u2019s figured everything out because of what he\u2019s been gifted.\n\nObviously, after the end of the Chunin exams, Boruto matures a *little bit* by learning of his father\u2019s experiences and what it really means to be a ninja, but that isn\u2019t the end of his journey. It doesn\u2019t solve his core issue of *overconfidence*.  He is still immature.\n\nBecause of Boruto\u2019s overconfidence in himself, he accepted the rasengan against Momoshiki which ultimately gave him the [Kama Seal](https://preview.redd.it/3bm4c8x9oav11.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=32194b13e99071cd41889a2ef45c99712549a9b0). As a character, this moment is HUGE since it shows how his overconfidence in himself will one day take everything from him. It\u2019s at this point when Boruto begins to get *consequences* for his selfish actions.\n\nIn the latest chapter, Boruto uses his Kama seal to teleport through dimensions. He gloats about this to Naruto and Sasuke, but, as we know now, this only furthers the process of Momoshiki\u2019s reincarnation into Boruto through the Kama. His actions will have consequences. He will lose everything.\n\nIt is because of Boruto *begging* to go with Naruto and Sasuke in the fight against Ishikki that one of them will inevitably die because of him losing control of his [Borushiki State](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ERXcSmbUwAEdqdZ.jpg).\n\nAnd, it is because of Boruto thinking that he could do something against Delta that Kawaki lost an arm.\n\nBecause of Boruto\u2019s major character flaw, Boruto will lose everything that he holds dear to him. Everything that he once had. His family, his friends, and even being able to call himself a ninja, and THAT is how Boruto will finally be able to mature past who he was. Boruto will mature through *loss*, like we saw in this flash forward [here](https://i2.wp.com/animehunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Boruto-Teen.jpg?fit=740%2C416&ssl=1).\n\nIn a sense, you could say that Boruto is an exact opposite of Naruto, which makes him an extremely unique protagonist, and dare I say one of the best of the new generation.\u201d",

            "body": ">The same applies. Boro had zero backstory and was just shallow, creepy and evil for no explained reason. \n\nYeah so? All but 3 or 4 of the Akatsuki were extremely shallow villains but people still like them. Orochimaru, the main villain of Part 1 was extremely shallow. While I agree that Boruto villains don't have as much depth as someone like Pain, none of these guys were ever meant to be long-term. Kara as an organization fell apart in like 15 chapters. We don't even know if Ishikki is the main villain yet.  \n\n\n> The other genin aren\u2019t involved in the story in any way except for shikadai being a plot device for amado to use. \n\nThe other genin doesn't matter in the manga and for good reason. They don't really add anything to the plot. The main cast of the manga (excluding the villains) includes Naruto, Sasuke, Boruto, Kawaki, Sarada, Mitsuki, Katasuke and Sumire. That's a good roundup. Why add 9 more to the mix?  \n\n\n> Its just one track for this weird alien plot. Which honestly i felt kaguya was the worst part of shippuden and they\u2019ve decided to make the entire plot of boruto revolve around more creatures like her \n\nKaguya was the worst part of Shippuden because she came out of literally nowhere and she was underdeveloped as a villain. The Otsutsuki clan in general came out of nowhere right at the end of Naruto so obviously it felt far-fetched. If the Otsutsuki clan was foreshadowed or even shown since the beginning of Naruto the I guarantee that it wouldn't have been as big of a problem. This is exactly what Boruto is doing, instead of coming up with an asspull alien clan out of nowhere, it actually *expands* upon it from the beginning of the series to make it an actually fleshed out plot point.",

                    "body": "I disagree that orochimaru was shallow. We got his whole story, and a rich personality through his interactions and they continued to build on him after his main arc. \n\nBoro is dead. What we got, which is nothing, is all we get. \n\nI don\u2019t think kara has been presented as just some small irrelevant group. So thats why i\u2019m frustrated with it falling apart in 15 chapters. If it turns out that theres another better organization going to emerge thats cool but they better be introduced and handled better than these guys.\n\nAs far as the other genin go i just feel that taking over the naruto world to tell a story and then not making use of any but the least amount of characters in it is kinda unfortunate. The world is really amazing and a lot of characters with great potential are going to waste in both the manga and \u201cexpanded\u201d anime. \n\nThe ootsuki is fundamentally a silly idea imo. And adding more ootsuki just introduces more plotholes. Isshki was chilling since the time kaguya got to earth apparently. If the story develops the ootsuki they introduce in a good way i\u2019m open to change my mind about them. But right now isshki is empty as hell too. He\u2019s so goddamn boring man. He gets interesting fights but his interactions are boring as fuck. Even though we know he has some history with kaguya, we don\u2019t know what he intends on doing  when he gets kawakis body or anything about him aside from that. So its hard for me to be attached to him in anyway but slight curiosity. Urashiki as the other ootsuki in the anime was the worst written character i\u2019ve probably ever seen. And momoshiki so far has been shallow as fuck too. We don\u2019t know what his goals were expect that these ootsuki are all parasites who want chakra.",

The anime right now is still pushing out \"anime canon\" because they dont want to get too ahead of the manga, leading to some of the problems you have mentioned such as the unnecessarily time travel arc. The manga however does have a really good plot that actually seems to pick up after the events of shippuden. Along with this the fights in the manga seemed to be leaning more towards the tactical fighting style from the original naruto rather than the Rasengan spam of Shippuden. So if you haven't tried the manga yet, give it a chance, it releases every month and the tensions are just rising in the latest chapters (New chapter Sept 18).",

The first few chapter can be slow but once it picks up the pace it really doesn't slow down. I can go a bit more into detail if you like but it would probably be going into light spoiler territory.

Things being in black and white make my eyes work harder to differentiate things, as well. It\u2019s why I like anime better - not only can the movement and color be a marvel in and of itself, I feel like I can follow what\u2019s happening much better and feel way more engaged with the story, especially with the addition of sound. Shounen in particular is one of those things that benefit more in execution in animation than 2D, in my opinion. It can just suck when an anime doesn\u2019t properly do it\u2019s manga justice, so it can\u2019t serve as a proper alternative medium for you to understand the story.\n\nI\u2019ll try to mess with my laptop\u2019s lighting to see if that helps any, and it\u2019ll definitely take me a while to go though, but I can at least try to read some of it.\nI really appreciate the suggestions!",

                    "body": "Again, did you watch the series? How do you not know that Boruto being a brat *was the point*? How do you not know that him having everything was *intentional*? You are missing the point of his character arc.\n\nI\u2019ll quote myself here;\n\n\u201cThe point is that Boruto\u2019s character arc is maturity. For the first 5~ chapters, Boruto starts off as some brat who had everything. A good family, skill in combat, friends, everything he could have wanted for a boy his age. He even stated this himself in the [first chapter](https://cdn.mangaeden.com/mangasimg/9e/9e2cf3139bb524293f45959c91c95f1b9ca399d3c8e00b9dd4281046.png). But, the one thing that he didn\u2019t have was a father. For most, this issue would be as simple as just creating a plan for your dad to come home more often, but, instead Boruto goes out of his way to *cheat* on the one test that actually mattered in his ninja career to get attention from him. This introduces a major character flaw for Boruto; he\u2019s cocky and therefore overconfident. He thinks he\u2019s figured everything out because of what he\u2019s been gifted.\n\nObviously, after the end of the Chunin exams, Boruto matures a *little bit* by learning of his father\u2019s experiences and what it really means to be a ninja, but that isn\u2019t the end of his journey. It doesn\u2019t solve his core issue of *overconfidence*.  He is still immature.\n\nBecause of Boruto\u2019s overconfidence in himself, he accepted the rasengan against Momoshiki which ultimately gave him the [Kama Seal](https://preview.redd.it/3bm4c8x9oav11.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=32194b13e99071cd41889a2ef45c99712549a9b0). As a character, this moment is HUGE since it shows how his overconfidence in himself will one day take everything from him. It\u2019s at this point when Boruto begins to get *consequences* for his selfish actions.\n\nIn the latest chapter, Boruto uses his Kama seal to teleport through dimensions. He gloats about this to Naruto and Sasuke, but, as we know now, this only furthers the process of Momoshiki\u2019s reincarnation into Boruto through the Kama. His actions will have consequences. He will lose everything.\n\nIt is because of Boruto *begging* to go with Naruto and Sasuke in the fight against Ishikki that one of them will inevitably die because of him losing control of his [Borushiki State](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ERXcSmbUwAEdqdZ.jpg).\n\nAnd, it is because of Boruto thinking that he could do something against Delta that Kawaki lost an arm.\n\nBecause of Boruto\u2019s major character flaw, Boruto will lose everything that he holds dear to him. Everything that he once had. His family, his friends, and even being able to call himself a ninja, and THAT is how Boruto will finally be able to mature past who he was. Boruto will mature through *loss*, like we saw in this flash forward [here](https://i2.wp.com/animehunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Boruto-Teen.jpg?fit=740%2C416&ssl=1).\n\nIn a sense, you could say that Boruto is an exact opposite of Naruto, which makes him an extremely unique protagonist, and dare I say one of the best of the new generation.\u201d",

            "body": "I disagree that orochimaru was shallow. We got his whole story, and a rich personality through his interactions and they continued to build on him after his main arc. \n\nBoro is dead. What we got, which is nothing, is all we get. \n\nI don\u2019t think kara has been presented as just some small irrelevant group. So thats why i\u2019m frustrated with it falling apart in 15 chapters. If it turns out that theres another better organization going to emerge thats cool but they better be introduced and handled better than these guys.\n\nAs far as the other genin go i just feel that taking over the naruto world to tell a story and then not making use of any but the least amount of characters in it is kinda unfortunate. The world is really amazing and a lot of characters with great potential are going to waste in both the manga and \u201cexpanded\u201d anime. \n\nThe ootsuki is fundamentally a silly idea imo. And adding more ootsuki just introduces more plotholes. Isshki was chilling since the time kaguya got to earth apparently. If the story develops the ootsuki they introduce in a good way i\u2019m open to change my mind about them. But right now isshki is empty as hell too. He\u2019s so goddamn boring man. He gets interesting fights but his interactions are boring as fuck. Even though we know he has some history with kaguya, we don\u2019t know what he intends on doing  when he gets kawakis body or anything about him aside from that. So its hard for me to be attached to him in anyway but slight curiosity. Urashiki as the other ootsuki in the anime was the worst written character i\u2019ve probably ever seen. And momoshiki so far has been shallow as fuck too. We don\u2019t know what his goals were expect that these ootsuki are all parasites who want chakra.",

As a result, I only really read short manga. I can\u2019t read longer manga long term, as much as I\u2019d like to.\n\nI don\u2019t think I can care enough about Boruto to try either way, because after all, aren\u2019t most of the points I still made (beside the time travel stuff, I guess) still true for the manga as well? Or is the premise really so different?\n\nI have heard that the best part about Boruto is the manga, so I\u2019ll at least look at places like the wiki to find details as to why.\n\nThank you for taking the time to respond, though!

The story more focuses on the otsutsuki and the special mark that you see one of them put on boruto. The story feels like its nearing the point where it does a time skip, which we know is bound to happen because of the part in the beginning. The first few chapter can be slow but once it picks up the pace it really doesn't slow down. I can go a bit more into detail if you like but it would probably be going into light spoiler territory. As for eye strain I reccomend trying to read it on a phone or pc (tachiyomi for android, mangadex for pc) with a blue light filter on. I hope I can convince you to read it because the story is honestly enticing and I hate having to wait a month between chapters.",

I had no idea that the story could be so different, that\u2019s kinda strange, but interesting, honestly.\n\nPersonally, part of the eye strain is picking up all the many small details drawn for a manga panel along with following/\u201cinducing\u201d movement for action and fighting scenes, so putting them on a smaller screen would make it harder for me to figure what\u2019s going on. Things being in black and white make my eyes work harder to differentiate things, as well. It\u2019s why I like anime better - not only can the movement and color be a marvel in and of itself, I feel like I can follow what\u2019s happening much better and feel way more engaged with the story, especially with the addition of sound. Shounen in particular is one of those things that benefit more in execution in animation than 2D, in my opinion. It can just suck when an anime doesn\u2019t properly do it\u2019s manga justice, so it can\u2019t serve as a proper alternative medium for you to understand the story.\n\nI\u2019ll try to mess with my laptop\u2019s lighting to see if that helps any, and it\u2019ll definitely take me a while to go though, but I can at least try to read some of it.\nI really appreciate the suggestions!",

            "body": "Again, did you watch the series? How do you not know that Boruto being a brat *was the point*? How do you not know that him having everything was *intentional*? You are missing the point of his character arc.\n\nI\u2019ll quote myself here;\n\n\u201cThe point is that Boruto\u2019s character arc is maturity. For the first 5~ chapters, Boruto starts off as some brat who had everything. A good family, skill in combat, friends, everything he could have wanted for a boy his age. He even stated this himself in the [first chapter](https://cdn.mangaeden.com/mangasimg/9e/9e2cf3139bb524293f45959c91c95f1b9ca399d3c8e00b9dd4281046.png). But, the one thing that he didn\u2019t have was a father. For most, this issue would be as simple as just creating a plan for your dad to come home more often, but, instead Boruto goes out of his way to *cheat* on the one test that actually mattered in his ninja career to get attention from him. This introduces a major character flaw for Boruto; he\u2019s cocky and therefore overconfident. He thinks he\u2019s figured everything out because of what he\u2019s been gifted.\n\nObviously, after the end of the Chunin exams, Boruto matures a *little bit* by learning of his father\u2019s experiences and what it really means to be a ninja, but that isn\u2019t the end of his journey. It doesn\u2019t solve his core issue of *overconfidence*.  He is still immature.\n\nBecause of Boruto\u2019s overconfidence in himself, he accepted the rasengan against Momoshiki which ultimately gave him the [Kama Seal](https://preview.redd.it/3bm4c8x9oav11.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=32194b13e99071cd41889a2ef45c99712549a9b0). As a character, this moment is HUGE since it shows how his overconfidence in himself will one day take everything from him. It\u2019s at this point when Boruto begins to get *consequences* for his selfish actions.\n\nIn the latest chapter, Boruto uses his Kama seal to teleport through dimensions. He gloats about this to Naruto and Sasuke, but, as we know now, this only furthers the process of Momoshiki\u2019s reincarnation into Boruto through the Kama. His actions will have consequences. He will lose everything.\n\nIt is because of Boruto *begging* to go with Naruto and Sasuke in the fight against Ishikki that one of them will inevitably die because of him losing control of his [Borushiki State](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ERXcSmbUwAEdqdZ.jpg).\n\nAnd, it is because of Boruto thinking that he could do something against Delta that Kawaki lost an arm.\n\nBecause of Boruto\u2019s major character flaw, Boruto will lose everything that he holds dear to him. Everything that he once had. His family, his friends, and even being able to call himself a ninja, and THAT is how Boruto will finally be able to mature past who he was. Boruto will mature through *loss*, like we saw in this flash forward [here](https://i2.wp.com/animehunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Boruto-Teen.jpg?fit=740%2C416&ssl=1).\n\nIn a sense, you could say that Boruto is an exact opposite of Naruto, which makes him an extremely unique protagonist, and dare I say one of the best of the new generation.\u201d",

The story more focuses on the otsutsuki and the special mark that you see one of them put on boruto. The story feels like its nearing the point where it does a time skip, which we know is bound to happen because of the part in the beginning. The first few chapter can be slow but once it picks up the pace it really doesn't slow down. I can go a bit more into detail if you like but it would probably be going into light spoiler territory. As for eye strain I reccomend trying to read it on a phone or pc (tachiyomi for android, mangadex for pc) with a blue light filter on. I hope I can convince you to read it because the story is honestly enticing and I hate having to wait a month between chapters.",
