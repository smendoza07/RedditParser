It was a pretty fun show. I feel like they tried to do a Friends, but quite didn't catch the spark, but still funny.\n\nAnother fun hit show before Yoo Jae Suk rose to fame was \ub3d9\uac70\ub3d9\ub77d (Live and Enjoy Together)... This was show that X-Men got its idea from. It was a group of celebrities just chilling and hanging out together...and playing all kinds of ridiculous games while competing with each other.\n\nThe early seasons of Impossible Challenge \ubb34\ud55c\ub3c4\uc804 were very good as well as Happy Together.\n\nThese were all great shows, but YJS didn't really gain international attention until Running Man it seems.\n\nYou can probably google and try to find where to stream it...I haven't watched them in forever, but I'm a huge fan of YJS growing up. You should definitely look up **Live and Enjoy Together** and **Awesome Friends. Also, the first season of Impossible Challenge.** Strangely enough, my sense of humor fit well with those shows that YJS did lol",

You should definitely look up **Live and Enjoy Together** and **Awesome Friends.
