If Sasuke somehow asspulls a way to get as much/more power, Naruto will asspull incredible skill &/or even more power, to equal or surpass it. \n\nNaruto also doesn't want to kill Sasuke and attempts to equal his output, which means Sasuke  controls the fight. He decides when to step it up, Naruto has to respond equally in time.",

I am trained in stealth warfare and I\u2019m the top Kekkei Genkai user in the Hidden Leaf. You are nothing to me but just another genin. I will wipe you the fuck out with ninjutsu the likes of which has never been seen before in the Ninja World, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over ninja scrolls? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of ANBU agents across the Fire Country and your chakra is being traced right now so you better prepare for the Raikiri, maggot. The storm jutsu that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your Ninja Way. You\u2019re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you with over one thousand techniques, and that\u2019s without use of Sharingan. Not only am I extensively trained in taijutsu, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Seventh Hokage and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the Ninja World, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little \u201cclever\u201d comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn\u2019t, you didn\u2019t, and now you\u2019re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit Fire Release all over you and you will burn in it. You\u2019re fucking dead, kiddo.",

Also, Obito had some really disrespectful moments in the show too. Sasuke's best disrespectful moment imo is in Boruto when Kinshiki tells him that he is not getting away and he just opens a portal and gets away. That shit was really disrespectful.",

I\u2019ll have you know I graduated top of my batch in the Chuunin Exams, and I\u2019ve been involved in numerous secret raids on the Akatsuki, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in stealth warfare and I\u2019m the top Kekkei Genkai user in the Hidden Leaf. You are nothing to me but just another genin. I will wipe you the fuck out with ninjutsu the likes of which has never been seen before in the Ninja World, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over ninja scrolls? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of ANBU agents across the Fire Country and your chakra is being traced right now so you better prepare for the Raikiri, maggot. The storm jutsu that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your Ninja Way. You\u2019re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you with over one thousand techniques, and that\u2019s without use of Sharingan. Not only am I extensively trained in taijutsu, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Seventh Hokage and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the Ninja World, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little \u201cclever\u201d comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn\u2019t, you didn\u2019t, and now you\u2019re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit Fire Release all over you and you will burn in it. You\u2019re fucking dead, kiddo.",

I am trained in stealth warfare and I\u2019m the top Kekkei Genkai user in the Hidden Leaf. You are nothing to me but just another genin. I will wipe you the fuck out with ninjutsu the likes of which has never been seen before in the Ninja World, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over ninja scrolls? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of ANBU agents across the Fire Country and your chakra is being traced right now so you better prepare for the Raikiri, maggot. The storm jutsu that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your Ninja Way. You\u2019re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you with over one thousand techniques, and that\u2019s without use of Sharingan. Not only am I extensively trained in taijutsu, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Seventh Hokage and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the Ninja World, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little \u201cclever\u201d comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn\u2019t, you didn\u2019t, and now you\u2019re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit Fire Release all over you and you will burn in it. You\u2019re fucking dead, kiddo.",

I\u2019ll have you know I graduated top of my batch in the Chuunin Exams, and I\u2019ve been involved in numerous secret raids on the Akatsuki, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in stealth warfare and I\u2019m the top Kekkei Genkai user in the Hidden Leaf. You are nothing to me but just another genin. I will wipe you the fuck out with ninjutsu the likes of which has never been seen before in the Ninja World, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over ninja scrolls? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of ANBU agents across the Fire Country and your chakra is being traced right now so you better prepare for the Raikiri, maggot. The storm jutsu that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your Ninja Way. You\u2019re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you with over one thousand techniques, and that\u2019s without use of Sharingan. Not only am I extensively trained in taijutsu, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Seventh Hokage and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the Ninja World, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little \u201cclever\u201d comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn\u2019t, you didn\u2019t, and now you\u2019re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit Fire Release all over you and you will burn in it. You\u2019re fucking dead, kiddo.",
