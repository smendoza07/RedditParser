But for a bit your haircut is just going to be keeping the sides cleaned up. \n\nMeanwhile add a bit of medium hold product and have your hair up and back a bit. Don\u2019t try to \u201chide the hairline\u201d by combing hair over your hairline, it will look thin. If you don\u2019t do the up and back look, pic a side and brush it to one. Again adding a bit of height with some product. \n\nOnce it is fairly long so to a salon and see what your options are. If it\u2019s too thin after you grew it out then at least you will know and can buzz, shave or more military cut. But every hair stylist I go to says that first thing is you have to grow it out. Otherwise they don\u2019t have anything to work with.",

            "body": "Everyone in this thread may be right about shaving. But there\u2019s one last ditch effort you can try. Your temple region is not entirely bald but covered in vellus hairs (thin, wispy baby hairs). Vellus hairs in adults are kinda the sign that the hair follicles are dying in those areas but are not dead yet. \n\nYou may be able to reverse the thin wispy hairs back to terminal (normal) hairs if you can stimulate blood growth to the area and force them into the anagen phase. By looking at how many hairs you still have on your temples there\u2019s a strong likelihood you could regain 20-40% of your hairline\n\nThere\u2019s 3 ways to do this:\n\nVasodilation: basically medication or oils you put topically on you scalp that forced your hair folicles to absorb more nutrients from your blood. This medicine is minoxidil (rogain) and will probably take a years worth of using to see results.  Derma rolling can help with this. \n\nDHT inhibitors: Basically DHT is a hormone that causes hairloss. you can use topical dht inhibitors like Nizoral Shampoo to lower the DHT levels at the scalp. This will not likely reverse the thinning but help halt it. You can take oral inhibitors like finasteride which have been seen to have great results but beware the side effects (I would only do this as a last ditch effort and nothing else is working) \n\nNutrient deficiency: if you\u2019ve noticed a lot of hairloss recently, it might be due to a nutrient deficiency like being low in vitamin D or anemia. Get bloodwork done on your nutrient and hormone levels to see if you need to start taking supplements or fix ur diet. Biotin supplements are not a terrible idea either way. \n\n\nI hope this info is helpful. I would personally start with shaving my head, and do the nutrient test. then if that doesn\u2019t yield any interesting information go to the minoxidil + dermarolling + nizoral shampoo for a year. If that doesn\u2019t help then I would consider just letting nature take its course",

My advice will be to go with a doctor, endocrinologist and a dermatologist to discard any hormonal issue, vitamins deficiency, or any fungi thats on your scalp. Go with a nutritionist so they can give you a proper diet, good diet is more likely to give you stronger hair. Watch out for your stress levels, higher levels of stress means more hair loss. You can go with treatments, I only know minoxidil and I know it works (my friend couldn\u2019t grow a beard but with like 1 1/2 or 2 years of treatment he finally was able to grow a beard) and that\u2019s the only one I know but there are others, the doctor can tell you better. As long as you have hair there is hope. Also I recommend you talking with a stylist for tips on how to take care of your hair like shampoos, conditioner, etc.",

But for a bit your haircut is just going to be keeping the sides cleaned up. \n\nMeanwhile add a bit of medium hold product and have your hair up and back a bit. Don\u2019t try to \u201chide the hairline\u201d by combing hair over your hairline, it will look thin. If you don\u2019t do the up and back look, pic a side and brush it to one. Again adding a bit of height with some product. \n\nOnce it is fairly long so to a salon and see what your options are. If it\u2019s too thin after you grew it out then at least you will know and can buzz, shave or more military cut. But every hair stylist I go to says that first thing is you have to grow it out. Otherwise they don\u2019t have anything to work with.",

Don\u2019t try to \u201chide the hairline\u201d by combing hair over your hairline, it will look thin. If you don\u2019t do the up and back look, pic a side and brush it to one. Again adding a bit of height with some product. \n\nOnce it is fairly long so to a salon and see what your options are. If it\u2019s too thin after you grew it out then at least you will know and can buzz, shave or more military cut. But every hair stylist I go to says that first thing is you have to grow it out.
