If they gave Naruto and Sasuke the same consistent strength, then you'd still have people complaining at how Naruto and Sasuke always have to \"save Boruto and company\" from trouble every time.\n\nYou have to make the mentors at least a little bit weak, or at the very least, susceptible to some sort of drawback, to give incentive to the students to be able to grow beyond that. \n\nThis is exactly what we saw happen with Jiraiya in shippuden.

That assertion would only be true if the series had been left alone after the end of The Last (Ha-ha): Naruto the Movie. The fact that the series continues on and that, like you stated to someone else, the children of the cast of Naruto will have to face their own obstacles that will likely be greater than the ones their parents faced.\n\nThere is a direct parallel to the irony of Naruto's successor series and what you're stating to the irony of World War I being referred to as \"The war to end all wars\" and the very next generation fighting an even bloodier conflict than that where in even greater atrocities were committed.",

In this case the manga (in some cases webcomics or light novels). Since manga goes slower than the anime (boruto manga is monthly I think) they have to add extra stuff or prolong original stuff so the anime doesn't catch up to manga. This extra stuff they put in is filler. It has no relation to the story cause it doesn't exist in the story. Sometimes they will put just a small amount of original story in an otherwise filler episode. These are mixed episodes. Most long running anime have all this since anime frequently cached upto manga, so they have to essentially slow anime down multiple times, resulting is multiples filler arcs, prolonged episodes cannon and mixed. Time travel doesn't happen in manga, so it's not a part of original story, so when all this ended, they resumed where they left off manga, there is NO CHANGE in anything in the story as its simply continuing where it left off",

It doesn't take a genius to know that boruto has 50% or so filler (someone check me on this tho I'm not sure exactly).

For naruto i'd prefer weekly episodes even if it includes filler over seasons where you have to wait like a year or more between them. Than i'd rather wait for a filler arc to be over (which is a lot shorter than whats between seasons usually) than wait a year or two. Like they can totally make fights last less long even in the weeky ep format. (and btw bortuto has none of this too long fight issue yet) There are only a few ones that are too long, its not every fight just a few. Like sakura vs sasori and 3rd hokage vs orochimaru.

People recommend the manga as if it's somehow better when it's just as bad as the show. \n\nI really wanted to like Boruto because of how much I liked Naruto and how much it meant to me, but it's so... Mediocre. It's just a money grab. There's no love or passion behind it and you can see it in the show and on the pages of the manga. \n\nIt's a shame, it could've been a really good sequel if it was made by someone that loved Naruto and had a passion for what they did. \n\nBut I can't really blame the people behind it that much for not being passionate about working on a manga series, seeing as how the industry destroyes people with a passion, as it did for Kishimoto himself who had lost it by the end of Naruto.",

Because what I have read and seen is basically ( and I am trying to not go into spoiler territory ) the worst version of the  characters that we know and love mostly Sasuke and Naruto. Like how on earth is Boruto relevant in any fight when you have basically the strongest god tier ninjas and they have to be basically nerfed all the time so that Boruto can step in and \"save the day\" and also the whole thing with Naruto being a bad father and the whole day in the office and not being able to spend time with his fam bullshit. My boy gave Kurama's chakra to a whole army but cannot leave 10 clones in the office to do all the paperwork. For me it feels just like a slap to the face to the Naruto fans like if you wanted to continue the story just leave the old characters in the past and focus just on Boruto and the new generation and not Naruto Sasuke and Boruto. They could've went with The Last era where Naruto was a young adult and doing missions and falling in love with Hinata  or showing how Sasuke is struggling with himself trying to reintegrate himself back to the village. I just hope they gonna pull some dragonball gt shit on our asses and completely ignore Boruto and make a Naruto Super or something like that in maybe I dunno 10 years or so",

And they have less screen time in Boruto (obviously bc theyre not the main characters), and I can't get past that just because I personally Want more of the old characters. I like the idea of how everything is more peaceful because that's what they strived for. But man then I remember that none of that matters? Because in that first episode or w/e the village was destroyed in the future?? And that hurts me too. Maybe I'd like a slice of life with the old Naruto characters more if it focused on them more. I don't hate Boruto, but I watched it for the slivers of moments I'd see of Shikamaru and it was never enough to satisfy me. \n\nAlso the fact that Naruto is a shitty father angers me. His whole thing has been about being kind and there for people and he can't do that for his own family?? Cmon :(",

Now I never watched any Naruto movies or anything so there may be some cannon I've missed but I really only had one complaint with Boruto. I watched roughly 30 episodes of it, so far. The main annoyance I had was, the whole point of Naruto is this knucklehead kid basically everyone picks on actually becomes amazing and a key ninja in the war. Basically winning it alongside of less than 10 ninja. He's pretty important. Regardless, the entire time they keep repeating \"He's gonna be the Hokage one day, he's gonna be the Hokage one day.\" Repeatedly. Then when it finally happens, his son just trashes on him. \n\nNow I believe eventually Boruto comes around and sees his dad as an actual good human being. But after waiting almost 1000 episodes for Naruto to become Hokage, it's pretty annoying and off putting to have him be disrespected almost as soon as he gets the position. Boruto hates him and disrespects him so much and it almost makes it not worth it, because after all that work, the person who should respect him the most doesn't.",

When seeing naruto I was curious to see the characters past and what they would do next. The story was told in a way that built up a lot of suspense and lined up encounters and conflicts. Even more telling backstories along the way that completely changed the perception of characters. \n\nBoruto kind of lacks that suspense and mystery. The intro scene was a good start, but that alone cannot carry it. I\u2019m interested to see how Boruto becomes the person in the intro scene, but the storytelling and maybe also characters lack what I liked Naruto such as the stories and characters Pain, Itachi, Naruto, Sasuke, Orochimaru etc etc",

That assertion would only be true if the series had been left alone after the end of The Last (Ha-ha): Naruto the Movie. The fact that the series continues on and that, like you stated to someone else, the children of the cast of Naruto will have to face their own obstacles that will likely be greater than the ones their parents faced.\n\nThere is a direct parallel to the irony of Naruto's successor series and what you're stating to the irony of World War I being referred to as \"The war to end all wars\" and the very next generation fighting an even bloodier conflict than that where in even greater atrocities were committed.",

In this case the manga (in some cases webcomics or light novels). Since manga goes slower than the anime (boruto manga is monthly I think) they have to add extra stuff or prolong original stuff so the anime doesn't catch up to manga. This extra stuff they put in is filler. It has no relation to the story cause it doesn't exist in the story. Sometimes they will put just a small amount of original story in an otherwise filler episode. These are mixed episodes. Most long running anime have all this since anime frequently cached upto manga, so they have to essentially slow anime down multiple times, resulting is multiples filler arcs, prolonged episodes cannon and mixed. Time travel doesn't happen in manga, so it's not a part of original story, so when all this ended, they resumed where they left off manga, there is NO CHANGE in anything in the story as its simply continuing where it left off",

Second (idk reddit editing) but the article and reddit post both say \"boruto manga is cannon to naruto\" means yes it is in fact a full continuation of the story rather than a new story. Third about parallel arcs, you really think the creators themselves would say they have filler? It's not good for business. It doesn't take a genius to know that boruto has 50% or so filler (someone check me on this tho I'm not sure exactly). Their whole statememt looks dressed up but basically says \"it has filler but don't worry time to time we go back to manga to keep up with the original story\"",

Like they can totally make fights last less long even in the weeky ep format.

That assertion would only be true if the series had been left alone after the end of The Last (Ha-ha): Naruto the Movie. The fact that the series continues on and that, like you stated to someone else, the children of the cast of Naruto will have to face their own obstacles that will likely be greater than the ones their parents faced.\n\nThere is a direct parallel to the irony of Naruto's successor series and what you're stating to the irony of World War I being referred to as \"The war to end all wars\" and the very next generation fighting an even bloodier conflict than that where in even greater atrocities were committed.",

In this case the manga (in some cases webcomics or light novels). Since manga goes slower than the anime (boruto manga is monthly I think) they have to add extra stuff or prolong original stuff so the anime doesn't catch up to manga. This extra stuff they put in is filler. It has no relation to the story cause it doesn't exist in the story. Sometimes they will put just a small amount of original story in an otherwise filler episode. These are mixed episodes. Most long running anime have all this since anime frequently cached upto manga, so they have to essentially slow anime down multiple times, resulting is multiples filler arcs, prolonged episodes cannon and mixed. Time travel doesn't happen in manga, so it's not a part of original story, so when all this ended, they resumed where they left off manga, there is NO CHANGE in anything in the story as its simply continuing where it left off",

Like they can totally make fights last less long even in the weeky ep format. (and btw bortuto has none of this too long fight issue yet) There are only a few ones that are too long, its not every fight just a few. Like sakura vs sasori and 3rd hokage vs orochimaru.

In this case the manga (in some cases webcomics or light novels). Since manga goes slower than the anime (boruto manga is monthly I think) they have to add extra stuff or prolong original stuff so the anime doesn't catch up to manga. This extra stuff they put in is filler. It has no relation to the story cause it doesn't exist in the story. Sometimes they will put just a small amount of original story in an otherwise filler episode. These are mixed episodes. Most long running anime have all this since anime frequently cached upto manga, so they have to essentially slow anime down multiple times, resulting is multiples filler arcs, prolonged episodes cannon and mixed. Time travel doesn't happen in manga, so it's not a part of original story, so when all this ended, they resumed where they left off manga, there is NO CHANGE in anything in the story as its simply continuing where it left off",

Second (idk reddit editing) but the article and reddit post both say \"boruto manga is cannon to naruto\" means yes it is in fact a full continuation of the story rather than a new story. Third about parallel arcs, you really think the creators themselves would say they have filler? It's not good for business. It doesn't take a genius to know that boruto has 50% or so filler (someone check me on this tho I'm not sure exactly). Their whole statememt looks dressed up but basically says \"it has filler but don't worry time to time we go back to manga to keep up with the original story\"",

In this case the manga (in some cases webcomics or light novels). Since manga goes slower than the anime (boruto manga is monthly I think) they have to add extra stuff or prolong original stuff so the anime doesn't catch up to manga. This extra stuff they put in is filler. It has no relation to the story cause it doesn't exist in the story. Sometimes they will put just a small amount of original story in an otherwise filler episode. These are mixed episodes. Most long running anime have all this since anime frequently cached upto manga, so they have to essentially slow anime down multiple times, resulting is multiples filler arcs, prolonged episodes cannon and mixed. Time travel doesn't happen in manga, so it's not a part of original story, so when all this ended, they resumed where they left off manga, there is NO CHANGE in anything in the story as its simply continuing where it left off",

It doesn't take a genius to know that boruto has 50% or so filler (someone check me on this tho I'm not sure exactly).

In this case the manga (in some cases webcomics or light novels). Since manga goes slower than the anime (boruto manga is monthly I think) they have to add extra stuff or prolong original stuff so the anime doesn't catch up to manga. This extra stuff they put in is filler. It has no relation to the story cause it doesn't exist in the story. Sometimes they will put just a small amount of original story in an otherwise filler episode. These are mixed episodes. Most long running anime have all this since anime frequently cached upto manga, so they have to essentially slow anime down multiple times, resulting is multiples filler arcs, prolonged episodes cannon and mixed. Time travel doesn't happen in manga, so it's not a part of original story, so when all this ended, they resumed where they left off manga, there is NO CHANGE in anything in the story as its simply continuing where it left off",

It doesn't take a genius to know that boruto has 50% or so filler (someone check me on this tho I'm not sure exactly).

In this case the manga (in some cases webcomics or light novels). Since manga goes slower than the anime (boruto manga is monthly I think) they have to add extra stuff or prolong original stuff so the anime doesn't catch up to manga. This extra stuff they put in is filler. It has no relation to the story cause it doesn't exist in the story. Sometimes they will put just a small amount of original story in an otherwise filler episode. These are mixed episodes. Most long running anime have all this since anime frequently cached upto manga, so they have to essentially slow anime down multiple times, resulting is multiples filler arcs, prolonged episodes cannon and mixed. Time travel doesn't happen in manga, so it's not a part of original story, so when all this ended, they resumed where they left off manga, there is NO CHANGE in anything in the story as its simply continuing where it left off",

Since manga goes slower than the anime (boruto manga is monthly I think) they have to add extra stuff or prolong original stuff so the anime doesn't catch up to manga. This extra stuff they put in is filler. It has no relation to the story cause it doesn't exist in the story. Sometimes they will put just a small amount of original story in an otherwise filler episode. These are mixed episodes. Most long running anime have all this since anime frequently cached upto manga, so they have to essentially slow anime down multiple times, resulting is multiples filler arcs, prolonged episodes cannon and mixed. Time travel doesn't happen in manga, so it's not a part of original story, so when all this ended, they resumed where they left off manga, there is NO CHANGE in anything in the story as its simply continuing where it left off",
