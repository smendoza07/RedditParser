The more he does it, the more power he gets, too. \n\nPlus, depending on how darkly you want to look at his childhood memories of always being ignored and sidelined, he probably didn\u2019t care too much to begin with if he died. So, he\u2019s risking something that he places little value on in the first place, and always gets rewarded for it. Anyone would throw themselves into danger if they had a life like that.",

            "body": "Friendly reminder that it is okay to ask for help if you need it. \n\nAnd accepting the help that is offered to you doesn't negate all that you have managed to accomplish so far on your own either. \n\nBeing a self-made man is great, but denying help from others out of a sense of pride is the antithesis of emotional growth and maturity. \n\nFor a majority of the series whenever Naruto relies on Kurama's power during a fight, it is almost never without risk. \n\nTheir working relationship for a majority of the series is based on the idea that if Naruto were to die, so would Kurama, since he is sealed inside of him. So Kurama is basically being forced to lend him some of his power if he wants to continue existing, which is honestly not the healthiest dynamic between the two of them, but hats off to Naruto for figuring out that shit and not dying after Jiraiya pushed him off of a fucking cliff. \n\nSo the only times that Naruto ever calls on Kurama is when his own life or the lives of those around him are at risk.\n\nThe only times that Kurama ever tries to offer Naruto his power of his own volition is when he thinks that Naruto might just be desperate enough or emotionally unstable enough to give him the opening he needs to take over. \n\nIn these cases, Naruto's use of Kurama's power is a calculated risk; he's being forced to weigh the pros and cons of the decision while under extreme pressure due to the circumstances he is operating under. \n\nLater after Naruto manages to connect with Kurama, we finally see them working together as a team rather than the tense give and take relationship they had before. \n\nTo me at least, this doesn't seem like as much of a cop out when you consider everything it has taken for Naruto to get to this point. Up until then, the Nine Tailed Fox had been a source of hardship in Naruto's life, and the process of him learning to befriend his inner demons and use them to his advantage after suffering because of them for so long is a really fucking good character arc in my opinion. \n\nIt tracks with the idea that Naruto is a self made man because he is learning to work with something that has been a part of himself for pretty much his entire life, and the character development that he goes through in order to accomplish this may be a little fast paced for my preferences, but I can still appreciate the amount of emotional, physical, and mental effort that went into learning how to work with Kurama instead of against him. \n\nNow instead of operating on a business deal that's a little uncomfortably similar to the deal that Sasuke had with Orochimaru (with Kurama offering Naruto his power in the hopes that it will grant him the opportunity to take over control of his body and escape the seal) they are using the power of friendship to blow their enemies brains out. And that is beautiful. \n\nAll of the shit about him being Asura's incarnation however does feel a little half baked, even if the theme of gaining power through cooperation and friendship is reflected in both Asura's story and Naruto's relationship development with Kurama. \n\nI don't know, maybe it wouldn't feel like such a cop out if the Sage of Six Paths didn't just immediately grant him a free upgrade because of it.",

I was mocking you for calling someone else a fanboy because they responded to your comment about how naruto cant fuck hinata right without nine tails. \n\nHow did you take that and interpret it as me implying you where married? If you\u2019re referring to the glass house bit, I was calling you equally as much of a fanboy because you\u2019re talking about the sex life of two fictional characters and how healthy it is. Clearly you are just as invested into this series as the person you\u2019re calling a fanboy if you\u2019re worried how the MC manages to plow his wife without his power up pet.",

The more he does it, the more power he gets, too. \n\nPlus, depending on how darkly you want to look at his childhood memories of always being ignored and sidelined, he probably didn\u2019t care too much to begin with if he died. So, he\u2019s risking something that he places little value on in the first place, and always gets rewarded for it. Anyone would throw themselves into danger if they had a life like that.",

Kurama is an insta-win button sure, if you conveniently ignore the fact that 1) Naruto would die and 2) Naruto's loved ones would be severely hurt/die. \n\nIt's really only with Haku that going beserk ever gives Naruto a clean win. In fact, for the first two arcs of Shippuden, him losing control actively fucks things up",

The more he does it, the more power he gets, too. \n\nPlus, depending on how darkly you want to look at his childhood memories of always being ignored and sidelined, he probably didn\u2019t care too much to begin with if he died. So, he\u2019s risking something that he places little value on in the first place, and always gets rewarded for it. Anyone would throw themselves into danger if they had a life like that.",

I was mocking you for calling someone else a fanboy because they responded to your comment about how naruto cant fuck hinata right without nine tails. \n\nHow did you take that and interpret it as me implying you where married? If you\u2019re referring to the glass house bit, I was calling you equally as much of a fanboy because you\u2019re talking about the sex life of two fictional characters and how healthy it is. Clearly you are just as invested into this series as the person you\u2019re calling a fanboy if you\u2019re worried how the MC manages to plow his wife without his power up pet.",

I was mocking you for calling someone else a fanboy because they responded to your comment about how naruto cant fuck hinata right without nine tails. \n\nHow did you take that and interpret it as me implying you where married? If you\u2019re referring to the glass house bit, I was calling you equally as much of a fanboy because you\u2019re talking about the sex life of two fictional characters and how healthy it is. Clearly you are just as invested into this series as the person you\u2019re calling a fanboy if you\u2019re worried how the MC manages to plow his wife without his power up pet.",
