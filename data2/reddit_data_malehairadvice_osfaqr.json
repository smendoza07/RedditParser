He also didn't blend in the side properly. Just a very rushed effort. Top looks choppy also.\n\nOP also confirmed that the barber rushed him because he was the last appointment of the day, and his cut only took 20 minutes or less (which is crazy since he walked in with a full blown pony tail). \n\nMy local Barbers take like an hour minimum even if you walk in with 2 inches of hair on the sides and back.

You can absolutely tell the barber's rushed it, just by how choppy and uneven the sides are. I figured he didn't do enough passes with the clipper.

I figured he didn't do enough passes with the clipper. Blending is weak also. \n\nThe boys in my local shop take like an hour and I only used to go in with like 3-4 inches of hair on the sides & back. \n\nFind another place my brother. I hate barbers who rush. Maybe go to a joint that isn't super busy all the time. They generally provide better service.",
