Maybe against Hidan? That was mainly all kakashi and then everyone watching naruto. I just really enjoyed the strongly fleshed out cast in the original",

I really liked the darker side of ninja fights where sacrifices were part of teamwork and I think there was a missed opportunity to not include shikamaru even more with naruto planning/teamwork. The series is obviously legendary and these are minor gripes in hindsight",

I also really enjoyed the teamwork invoked with the Konoha invasion and moreso the planning in the sasuke retrieval arc even though it was 1v1 fights. \n\nWhich parts do you mean for being the last shot guy? Maybe against Hidan? That was mainly all kakashi and then everyone watching naruto. I just really enjoyed the strongly fleshed out cast in the original",
