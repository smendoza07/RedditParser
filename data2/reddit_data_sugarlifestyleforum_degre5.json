    "body": "Made a new reddit for this post.\n\nBy \"not safe\" I'm referring to your privacy, not other users.  The website is run by animals.\n\nLate 30s, average looking, $500k salary...nothing out of the ordinary.  \n\nDon't want to give away too much, but I do work in media industry.  Instagram is verified. \\~20k followers (hardly famous lol).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been on the site for 2 years.  Paid member.  Casual user.  Met about 10 off the site, sent messages to about 20 people total.  No problems.\n\nAccount got banned in July.  Was told \"we don't feel you are representing who you are\" and was told to supply an photo ID, which is very odd; never been asked to supply an photo ID online (and No, instagram doesn't ask you for your photo ID for verification).  \n\nNow the 20 people I did message, I always moved it to Instagram to talk (I don't give out my number easily and I don't do fake numbers).  I responded by telling seeking I've always given out my instagram and it's verified, but they just told me they needed to see ID to move forward.\n\nOk, so they don't care about the instagram, and I'm not comfortable scanning my ID to them so I just ask them to refund my membership and they just copy and paste a link to their rules (basically says they don't refund memberships for any reason).\n\nLast month, I called my AX card about a duplicate hotel charge of $2,800 that the hotel has been giving me the go around with refunding, so I mentioned the seeking payment and said I wanted to dispute that also.  \n\nSo today I call AX to put a travel notice on my card and asked about the seeking dispute and they said seeking responded.  You know what seeking did?  They sent screen shots of every message I ever received and sent out direct to AX as their response.  No mention of their no refund policy, no mention of them banning me, just screen shots of messages.  Every, single, one.\n\nWOW",

The average consumer does not want to face an arrogant vendor for their money back, much less when said vendor is in possession of data that could be embarrassing to the consumer.\n\nAmerican Express used to side with consumers almost all the time.\n\nI'm unsure what they do now. I'd still rather have them on my side than the garden variety Visa operator.\n\nYou may want to look into SA's publication of your intimate messages as a potential reason for legal action.  Chances are, they looked into it first, but their in-house counsel clearing it doesn't mean that 12 civilian jurors will agree\u2014provided a judge finds it receivable.  As a precedent, it sounds very scary.  I deplore that most of the respondents to your post did not pick up on that.\n\nGodspeed!",

After all, it'd be rather useless if I got on SA and used Tom Brady's pics and messaged everyone and told me to message me on Tom Brady's instagram.  What's the point of doing that if you aren't him?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nListen, if they don't want to accept a verified instagram, then that's fine.  Just puzzled why they can't look at those messages as proof of identity; yet they can send screen shots of the same message as proof to my credit card that I used the service.",

Don't think this needs much explaining, it is seeking\n\nThey ban me.  Went back and forth arguing with them through emails and it seemed like they made their point, they aren't unbanning me.  So I did the same thing asked for the membership money back and they said they don't do refunds.\n\nI paid on paypal and noticed their checkout page says I'm buying product, not a website membership.  So I just opened a dispute on paypal, I think it's called 'item not received'.  Seeking responded and it got pushed to paypal waiting to decide on the case, but it's been a week and no decision so I call paypal.  The lady said seeking just sent in screen shots of my conversations and started reading one.  Maybe we are two different people, but I just thought it was funny.  After about two sentences in the paypal agent get's the point lol.  Then goes back and said looks like they just sent in a bunch of screen shots of messages....obviously she didn't want to read all of them, I think she got enough in those two sentences HAHAHAHA.\n\nSo, she just says:  I don't see the seller provided a valid tracking number like we asked, I'll close this case in your favor at this time.   And I got a refund.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTake away points...\n\n1. I too never had a problem with anyone on the site.  Basically where I'm getting at is I don't think any girl reported me, I think seeking actually just looks through messages, or at least has keyword flags then reviews them in person then bans.  so yeah they do creep your sht\n2. unlike OP I didn't care paypal reading the messages.  i should add I don't have a face pic on seeking, just enough of my face to tell i have a nice jaw line and I workout.  and i never gave out any personal info like OP, just a b/s texting number.  plus the paypal rep was some outsourced called to philippians or wherever so I didn't care\n3. when arguing with seeking, they did say my account is gone for good, it's not appeal able, they already decided to ban me for good and delete everything, there is no way to restore it since it's been deleted for good and so on and so fourth.  and again arguing with them I told them it was a one time mistake and they responded telling me, no it's a repeated pattern and copied and pasted (not screen shots) a bunch of older messages.  not going to lie some of that was borderline, but the point here is they totally lied when they said they deleted everything and this lady even made the effort to dig through a sht load of messages to prove me wrong \n\nbut i agree with op 100% the company is very shady and sketch.  you must be a retard if you actually show this compan your ID, or as other's have said if you use your actual credit card instead of some b/s pre-loaded card.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nlet's just say knowing what I know now, if seeking told me they'd unban me if I told them my real first name (any guesses?) I'd literally tell them to fcuk off\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGiving seeking anything real and i mean anything real, is like shitting on a fan.  you're just asking for it.",

I asked them for a refund since I needed this hide your profile to work and they hit me with no refunds for any reason and I agreed to that when I signed up.  \n\n\nDisputed it with paypal like you have above, never called in to see what seeking said, just followed the email trails from me opening a dispute to seeking responding to paypal making me the winner since no proof of delivery.",

There are lots of categories for disputing a credit card charge. Here, the proper AMEX code would be C08 for  \"Goods/Services Not Received or Only Partially Received\". SA is attempting to prove it fully provided the services but they only gave OP X months out of a year. That doesn't cut the mustard.\n\n> this is standard merchant procedure\n\nNo. It isn't.

I'd still rather have them on my side than the garden variety Visa operator.\n\nYou may want to look into SA's publication of your intimate messages as a potential reason for legal action.  Chances are, they looked into it first, but their in-house counsel clearing it doesn't mean that 12 civilian jurors will agree\u2014provided a judge finds it receivable.

After all, it'd be rather useless if I got on SA and used Tom Brady's pics and messaged everyone and told me to message me on Tom Brady's instagram.  What's the point of doing that if you aren't him?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nListen, if they don't want to accept a verified instagram, then that's fine.  Just puzzled why they can't look at those messages as proof of identity; yet they can send screen shots of the same message as proof to my credit card that I used the service.",

The average consumer does not want to face an arrogant vendor for their money back, much less when said vendor is in possession of data that could be embarrassing to the consumer.\n\nAmerican Express used to side with consumers almost all the time.\n\nI'm unsure what they do now. I'd still rather have them on my side than the garden variety Visa operator.\n\nYou may want to look into SA's publication of your intimate messages as a potential reason for legal action.  Chances are, they looked into it first, but their in-house counsel clearing it doesn't mean that 12 civilian jurors will agree\u2014provided a judge finds it receivable.

I mean, there's that app that sends you \"free\" photos (just pay S&H) and I had to explain to my friend that it was because she's giving them all her usage data, and had to pull up the Terms and Conditions she accepted, to show her that she gave the app permission to monitor her activity even when she's not using the app. It also included a clause that made it sound like you're giving them permission to listen in on your phone convos and camera usage. Cuz like why does a photo printing company need access to your audio?? Sketch.",

That's a comment expected from a young insecure guy thats jealous. Ever think that maybe people on PornHub just enjoy sexually? How about just the fact it is easy money for having an orgasm? For a college student Im doing pretty well on my own and dont even need a SD. SD and PornHub are extra $$ for myself to put into investments for my future retirement. I live off the money I make being a Server. \n\nGrow up a little and maybe you wouldn't have the issue you're currently having, with SA",
