    "body": "As a SD, you might make certain presumptions about your partner's wardrobe.  Do not presume every lady has the outfit to go to a posh night spot.  Instead of asking, give her a range of places you might enjoy visiting.  Include something mainstream and something fancy.  Ask if she prefers comfortable or (fill in the blank).  The point is to make it easy on her to pick the place she will feel comfortable.  In time, if you want to take her to that kind of fancier place, take her out and buy her a dress with appropriate jewelry.  It need not be crazy expensive, and might be appreciated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, do not presume she has had good partners in an intimate sense.  It darkens the world and pisses me off personally, but some guy damaged my current partner.  Things are working well for us now, but to give you a sense of scope - she offered two quotes from the asshole -  \u201cwomen don\u2019t feel orgasms\u201d and \u201cif you\u2019re not bleeding and crying I\u2019m not having fun.\u201d  Never be that guy.
