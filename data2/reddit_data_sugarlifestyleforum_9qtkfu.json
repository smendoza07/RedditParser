    "body": "Update to my first post [https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/9pm6jb/so\\_im\\_pregnant](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/9pm6jb/so_im_pregnant)\n\nThank you all so much for all of the advice. I told a couple of friends and they helped me figure things out.\n\nI didn't tell my SD. I don't want him to think I'm that careless and I really, really need his support with school.\n\nI went to Planned Parenthood yesterday. They did some tests and I took the medical termination. I'm at home now curled up into a ball in my bed. My friend is bringing me hot water bottles and offering soup. \n\nThanks.\n\n(Don't know how long I'll keep this account...I'll start posting again under my regular one when I'm back to normal)\n\nGoing to rest now. Bye.\n\n&#x200B;",

I went to the clinic, too. I still wonder, some days, what the child would have been like. We could have supported the child, but were at a risky age. It's rough. \n\nIf I were the SD, I'd want to know. It was not her fault. It's a joint deal. It's too bad she just couldn't tell him.\n\nSad. In every direction one chooses to go.",

I had the surgical procedure done years ago and the guy I was seeing went with me.  He absolutely shared  a lot of the anxiety with me and was a great support system.  I don\u2019t think anyone can know all of the moving parts until they have been in the situation themselves... and even then I\u2019m sure there are men who are only \u201cworried\u201d about the \u201cdrama\u201d and child support... and those men show their true colors.  \n\nI agree and I hope someday she is able to open up to him about it.  If he is a good person he will probably ache for her that she had to go through it without him.  But I\u2019m sure he will understand her hesitation when she does decide to share.  ",
