You could literally destroy a guy\u2019s life at almost no fault of his own and not to mention the issues you could open up for yourself.\n\nI just had a girl share her snap with me, used her real name on snap (stupid as well) as when I searched it I found info on her that showed she was still in high school. She listed her age as 20 on seeking\n\nAgain, this happens far too much. Please stop...I\u2019m serious. You are going to get yourselves hurt and also completely destroy some unsuspecting guy.",

I don\u2019t think it is traced on social media though but I wouldn\u2019t doubt there is a way... So it\u2019s not about where the photo is being shared, it\u2019s about the photo itself having a location attached to it. And I\u2019m the same way. I like to have the location map thing in my photo albums but had to do away with it. I\u2019m not sure how to get around it. I think sometimes if you edit a pic on a picture editing app or whatever, and then you save the new version that the location does not stay tagged. I faintly remember that happening in the past. But I ended up just turning off location for photos altogether to avoid any risk.",

So, their parents won\u2019t buy them a ps4 or pay for their shopping trip; if you get an allowance, awesome because that\u2019s not most kids. Still though, actual abuse = actual actual, yet if you\u2019re thinking of sex work because you don\u2019t have what your Tiktok friends have, you have something else coming in life. Honestly, I wish that someone had called cps on my dad when me and my siblings were younger, but no one did.. it could\u2019ve transformed my life just having a father figure who wasn\u2019t an abusive alcoholic and also bipolar. If there\u2019s physical and mental abuse in a family, I could see how a young girl would want something stable to lean on because I did, but you can\u2019t look for that in a married man who you find looking for sex. As long as you\u2019re young though, there\u2019s help out there, but once you graduate and move away, it becomes \u201cyour fault\u201d for not moving on from abuse. \n\nTo any young girls who need help, please seek it out. I love you tremendously, and you\u2019re not alone.",

If there is any indication of money or gifts being exchanged in return of sexual favor then it can easily be seen as child prostitutions, child sexual exploitation, corruption of minor, contributory delinquency of minors, child enticement, unlawful contact with a minor etc. While the specific law would vary by state, there are many laws that prohibit relationship between adult/minor especially if there is an exchange of material gift involves doesn't even have to be money.\n\nAlso, in case of statutory rape its generally strict liability (meaning there is no defense). However, any other law besides that has \"mistake of age\" defense but the burden is on the defendant. In PA, a man was charged with corruption of minor for sex with a 16 years old (16 in the AOC in PA, so Statutory rape law didn't apply) where mistake of age is a defense. He claimed that he thought she was older because she is physically matured. Medical examination was done on the girl and it says she still has some years to develop and the jury also didn't think she looked older than a 16/17 years old. So he was jailed.\n\nI do feel sorry for guys who get duped into dating underage girls, but honestly I am a bit skeptical about being \"duped\" part. About 3 years ago a gun owner on Alabama got charged multiple crime for being with an underage SB even though she was over the age of consent. He tried the defense of \"mistake\" but didn't work because he never checked her ID, she looked young and they never discussed her age. I am not sure if I am sympathetic toward men who get caught with underage girls. Most child predator uses excuses like \"I didn't know\" while they did.",

Child sex trafficking is quite different from child prostitution law. My point was that SRs are often seen as prostitution. While in case of adult prosecutor needs to prove that a money was exchanged for sex, in case of minor as long as there is evidence the adult offered some kinds of gifts, favor or money in exchange for sex can be charged with \"solicitation of minor\"/child prostitution without any money being actually exchanged for sex. The law is different for minors. \n\nI did read the entire post. You claimed that there are \"affirmative defense\" as a form of statutory defense. \n\n> I would note that this is an affirmative defense, that is, the burden of proof falls on the person being charged, not the state. \n\nI pointed out that there is no \"affirmative defense\" for \"statutory rape\" (may be in Utah), but there is a \"mistake of age defense\" for OTHER statutory crimes besides the \"rape\". Its not federal law but states generally only treat \"statutory rape\" as strict liability while treating all other crime against minor as reasonable standard. Also, I was specifying that the burden of proof for \"mistake of age\" being on the defendant, there are other defense that is not on the defendant depending upon the crime.\n\nAnd, no I am not saying punish anyone who get accused of crime against children. I am saying that why \"I didn't know\" defense often doesn't work in court even if this defense is allowed for certain crime.",

Even implicitly talking sexually with a minor online, say roleplaying, is illegal of course, but if minor was on an adult site posing as a 20 year old that again wouldn\u2019t hold up.\n\nYou can\u2019t (or maybe I should say shouldn\u2019t) throw someone in jail when there was no intent to commit a crime. It\u2019s why I have a huge issue with strict liability crimes when it comes to age related sex crimes, especially in the internet age. Throwing someone\u2019s 20 year old boyfriend in jail for ten years because he got a nude snap from his 17 year old girlfriend is asinine, just like it would be insane to go out and throw any guy in jail who watches a porn of a girl who turned out to be 17 but posed as 18.",

However, the defense require that the accused at least tried to verify that the girl was an adult. If there is evidence that the accused didn't take reasonable measure to find out the age of the person then it could be considered a \"willful ignorance\" or \"ostrich defense\", which would be counted as defense. So, the matter of conviction is really difficult to predict if the DA choose to prosecute. The best case scenario would be DA entering a plea or ch0osing not to prosecute altogether. \n\nAlso, possession of child pornagraphy is not strict liability, it requires knowledge or intent to some extent, but \"sexting\" is a strict liability crime, which makes no sense to me. I do agree that sexting should not be a strict liability and it needs to have close in age exemption. In states like Colorado, 16 years old child can legally have sex with 26 years old man but sexting an 18 years old with put 18 years old in jail. Its absurd to me. Children having sex with an adult is much more harmful then sending bunch of nudes to similar age teen. US law needs a serious reform.",

I think its normal to be confused between 17-19 years old as they are all late teen even though 17 is a minor. Occasionally, I have seen 16 years boys and girls looking old enough to be passed for 20 something. Likewise, It is possible for a 21 years old to be passed as an older looking 16 years old kid. A lot of ephebophile uses childlike looking young women as a surrogate for their actual attraction toward actual children. That's another story. \n\nIn high school 18 years old typically look like young women, but if your friends think 16 years old generally look like college girls then I would find it concerning since considering pedophile/hebephile/ephebeophile genuinely can't distinguish between child and adult. This is another reason why mistake of age is not allowed because a lot child predaotrs are not malicious, they genuienly believe the kids looked older and that they are in \"love\". Read the book \"lolita\" its a great  insight in the mind of a pedophile who sees himself as the victim.",

The law is different for  minors.** \n\nNo, it isn't.  Prostitution charges Federally, and for most states, are written to reflect compensation, not solely hard currency.   You **can** be convicted for providing goods or services in kind.  I can attest to this  first hand as I worked adjacent to an investigation where game meat was provided as the compensation for prostitution services.  Child prostitution simply adds an extra element that must be proven; namely, age. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n **I did read the entire post.** \n\nYou very obviously did not.  We are talking only about statutory rape and child prostitution laws, no other laws.  I stated that statutory rape is almost exclusively a strict liability law...that is, there is no defense if you did the deed.  Manchester pointed out that some (non-prostitution) statutory rape laws do have what is called an affirmative defense, and cited Washington State law.  For reference:\n\n*Cornell Law on Affirmative Defense: This is a* [*defense*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/defense) *in which the* [*defendant*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/defendant) *introduces* [*evidence*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/evidence)*, which, if found to be credible, will negate* [*criminal*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/criminal_law) [*liability* ](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/liability)*or* [*civil liability*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/civil_liability)*, even if it is proven that the defendant committed the alleged acts.* \n\n **. Also, I was specifying that the burden of proof for \"mistake of age\" being on the defendant** \n\nYep, that is what an affirmative defense is.\n\n **affirmative defense\" as a form of statutory defense.** \n\nThese are two different things.  One is not the form of another.  Affirmative defense is above; statutory defense means there is a specific defense to a crime that has been legislated into statute. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n **And, no I am not saying punish anyone who get accused of crime against children.** \n\nOK, good. We agree then.\n\n **I am saying that why \"I didn't know\" defense often doesn't work in court even if this defense is allowed for certain crime.** \n\nIt is kind of unclear what you are trying to say here, but generally speaking ignorance is *never* a valid defense under the law.  I'm sure you might find some obscure case law that proves the exception, but generally speaking, no.",

They are finishing up their physical development and don't even have mental ability to follow through logical sequence to understand future consequence. So, they can't self-govern themselves yet even if they think they do. Nor many of them look like 21 years old. Some do especially with makeup and clothing. But generally this is a sorry ass excuse. The age of majority globally falls between 18-20. for a reason. \n\nFake IDs are not that easy to get and it cost money. Also, minor do get punished for using fake ID. So, they are not off the hook for anything. Minor teenagers are judged as an adult when they are few month shy from 18 and have done something serious like school shooting, murder, rape etc. I don't think minors should be able to screw over other lives but if an adult take a little precaution he/she can easily avoid that.",

The issue is a minor faking a government issued ID.\n\n>Minor teenagers are judged as an adult when they are few month shy from 18 and have done something serious like school shooting, murder, rape etc.\n\nHaving a fake ID Is a huge deal, I just don't get why people think this isn't important.

He was a video game creator who got charged for meeting a 16 year old on seeking. Problem is she had lied and said she was 20. Now almost a year later almost all charges were dropped, but it still likely completely ruined his life. There is a good Reddit thread where he responds directly with his side of the story and it is absolutely disgusting what happened to him. Essentially it sounds like the girl got caught and threw him under the bus because she was worried about getting in trouble.",

I will say however, it's not dumb to assume 16, 17, even 18 and 19 year olds don't know better. Grasping that something is right or wrong, sure, but understanding the actual consequences it could hold for the other parties involved? No. Many adults can barely think outside of themselves so how are we gonna ask that of a teenager? To me its kind of how you don't realize you were a dick if a child till you have child. At the end of the day, whether its fair or not, the law will always be on their side and SDs need to do their due diligence to filter as best possible to set themselves up for success. The bowl is risky business and you assume that risk once you enter.",

So, their parents won\u2019t buy them a ps4 or pay for their shopping trip; if you get an allowance, awesome because that\u2019s not most kids. Still though, actual abuse = actual actual, yet if you\u2019re thinking of sex work because you don\u2019t have what your Tiktok friends have, you have something else coming in life. Honestly, I wish that someone had called cps on my dad when me and my siblings were younger, but no one did.. it could\u2019ve transformed my life just having a father figure who wasn\u2019t an abusive alcoholic and also bipolar. If there\u2019s physical and mental abuse in a family, I could see how a young girl would want something stable to lean on because I did, but you can\u2019t look for that in a married man who you find looking for sex. As long as you\u2019re young though, there\u2019s help out there, but once you graduate and move away, it becomes \u201cyour fault\u201d for not moving on from abuse. \n\nTo any young girls who need help, please seek it out. I love you tremendously, and you\u2019re not alone.",

If there is any indication of money or gifts being exchanged in return of sexual favor then it can easily be seen as child prostitutions, child sexual exploitation, corruption of minor, contributory delinquency of minors, child enticement, unlawful contact with a minor etc. While the specific law would vary by state, there are many laws that prohibit relationship between adult/minor especially if there is an exchange of material gift involves doesn't even have to be money.\n\nAlso, in case of statutory rape its generally strict liability (meaning there is no defense). However, any other law besides that has \"mistake of age\" defense but the burden is on the defendant. In PA, a man was charged with corruption of minor for sex with a 16 years old (16 in the AOC in PA, so Statutory rape law didn't apply) where mistake of age is a defense. He claimed that he thought she was older because she is physically matured. Medical examination was done on the girl and it says she still has some years to develop and the jury also didn't think she looked older than a 16/17 years old. So he was jailed.\n\nI do feel sorry for guys who get duped into dating underage girls, but honestly I am a bit skeptical about being \"duped\" part. About 3 years ago a gun owner on Alabama got charged multiple crime for being with an underage SB even though she was over the age of consent. He tried the defense of \"mistake\" but didn't work because he never checked her ID, she looked young and they never discussed her age. I am not sure if I am sympathetic toward men who get caught with underage girls. Most child predator uses excuses like \"I didn't know\" while they did.",

Child sex trafficking is quite different from child prostitution law. My point was that SRs are often seen as prostitution. While in case of adult prosecutor needs to prove that a money was exchanged for sex, in case of minor as long as there is evidence the adult offered some kinds of gifts, favor or money in exchange for sex can be charged with \"solicitation of minor\"/child prostitution without any money being actually exchanged for sex. The law is different for minors. \n\nI did read the entire post. You claimed that there are \"affirmative defense\" as a form of statutory defense. \n\n> I would note that this is an affirmative defense, that is, the burden of proof falls on the person being charged, not the state. \n\nI pointed out that there is no \"affirmative defense\" for \"statutory rape\" (may be in Utah), but there is a \"mistake of age defense\" for OTHER statutory crimes besides the \"rape\". Its not federal law but states generally only treat \"statutory rape\" as strict liability while treating all other crime against minor as reasonable standard. Also, I was specifying that the burden of proof for \"mistake of age\" being on the defendant, there are other defense that is not on the defendant depending upon the crime.\n\nAnd, no I am not saying punish anyone who get accused of crime against children. I am saying that why \"I didn't know\" defense often doesn't work in court even if this defense is allowed for certain crime.",

Even implicitly talking sexually with a minor online, say roleplaying, is illegal of course, but if minor was on an adult site posing as a 20 year old that again wouldn\u2019t hold up.\n\nYou can\u2019t (or maybe I should say shouldn\u2019t) throw someone in jail when there was no intent to commit a crime. It\u2019s why I have a huge issue with strict liability crimes when it comes to age related sex crimes, especially in the internet age. Throwing someone\u2019s 20 year old boyfriend in jail for ten years because he got a nude snap from his 17 year old girlfriend is asinine, just like it would be insane to go out and throw any guy in jail who watches a porn of a girl who turned out to be 17 but posed as 18.",

These laws as well as the matter of online solicitation does require that element of \"knowledge\" that the accused knew about the age of the minor. However, the defense require that the accused at least tried to verify that the girl was an adult. If there is evidence that the accused didn't take reasonable measure to find out the age of the person then it could be considered a \"willful ignorance\" or \"ostrich defense\", which would be counted as defense. So, the matter of conviction is really difficult to predict if the DA choose to prosecute. The best case scenario would be DA entering a plea or ch0osing not to prosecute altogether. \n\nAlso, possession of child pornagraphy is not strict liability, it requires knowledge or intent to some extent, but \"sexting\" is a strict liability crime, which makes no sense to me. I do agree that sexting should not be a strict liability and it needs to have close in age exemption. In states like Colorado, 16 years old child can legally have sex with 26 years old man but sexting an 18 years old with put 18 years old in jail. Its absurd to me. Children having sex with an adult is much more harmful then sending bunch of nudes to similar age teen. US law needs a serious reform.",

Not to mention, the number of kids being targeted for child prostitutions is higher than number of kids who are just plain self-destructive. \n\n Even if these minor girls are signing for SA, any adult men needs to leave them alone as soon they learn their age or they reasonably look young.

I think its normal to be confused between 17-19 years old as they are all late teen even though 17 is a minor. Occasionally, I have seen 16 years boys and girls looking old enough to be passed for 20 something. Likewise, It is possible for a 21 years old to be passed as an older looking 16 years old kid. A lot of ephebophile uses childlike looking young women as a surrogate for their actual attraction toward actual children. That's another story. \n\nIn high school 18 years old typically look like young women, but if your friends think 16 years old generally look like college girls then I would find it concerning since considering pedophile/hebephile/ephebeophile genuinely can't distinguish between child and adult. This is another reason why mistake of age is not allowed because a lot child predaotrs are not malicious, they genuienly believe the kids looked older and that they are in \"love\". Read the book \"lolita\" its a great  insight in the mind of a pedophile who sees himself as the victim.",

The law is different for  minors.** \n\nNo, it isn't.  Prostitution charges Federally, and for most states, are written to reflect compensation, not solely hard currency.   You **can** be convicted for providing goods or services in kind.  I can attest to this  first hand as I worked adjacent to an investigation where game meat was provided as the compensation for prostitution services.  Child prostitution simply adds an extra element that must be proven; namely, age. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n **I did read the entire post.** \n\nYou very obviously did not.  We are talking only about statutory rape and child prostitution laws, no other laws.  I stated that statutory rape is almost exclusively a strict liability law...that is, there is no defense if you did the deed.  Manchester pointed out that some (non-prostitution) statutory rape laws do have what is called an affirmative defense, and cited Washington State law.  For reference:\n\n*Cornell Law on Affirmative Defense: This is a* [*defense*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/defense) *in which the* [*defendant*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/defendant) *introduces* [*evidence*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/evidence)*, which, if found to be credible, will negate* [*criminal*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/criminal_law) [*liability* ](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/liability)*or* [*civil liability*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/civil_liability)*, even if it is proven that the defendant committed the alleged acts.* \n\n **. Also, I was specifying that the burden of proof for \"mistake of age\" being on the defendant** \n\nYep, that is what an affirmative defense is.\n\n **affirmative defense\" as a form of statutory defense.** \n\nThese are two different things.  One is not the form of another.  Affirmative defense is above; statutory defense means there is a specific defense to a crime that has been legislated into statute. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n **And, no I am not saying punish anyone who get accused of crime against children.** \n\nOK, good. We agree then.\n\n **I am saying that why \"I didn't know\" defense often doesn't work in court even if this defense is allowed for certain crime.** \n\nIt is kind of unclear what you are trying to say here, but generally speaking ignorance is *never* a valid defense under the law.  I'm sure you might find some obscure case law that proves the exception, but generally speaking, no.",

They are finishing up their physical development and don't even have mental ability to follow through logical sequence to understand future consequence. So, they can't self-govern themselves yet even if they think they do. Nor many of them look like 21 years old. Some do especially with makeup and clothing. But generally this is a sorry ass excuse. The age of majority globally falls between 18-20. for a reason. \n\nFake IDs are not that easy to get and it cost money. Also, minor do get punished for using fake ID. So, they are not off the hook for anything. Minor teenagers are judged as an adult when they are few month shy from 18 and have done something serious like school shooting, murder, rape etc. I don't think minors should be able to screw over other lives but if an adult take a little precaution he/she can easily avoid that.",

I will say however, it's not dumb to assume 16, 17, even 18 and 19 year olds don't know better. Grasping that something is right or wrong, sure, but understanding the actual consequences it could hold for the other parties involved? No. Many adults can barely think outside of themselves so how are we gonna ask that of a teenager? To me its kind of how you don't realize you were a dick if a child till you have child. At the end of the day, whether its fair or not, the law will always be on their side and SDs need to do their due diligence to filter as best possible to set themselves up for success. The bowl is risky business and you assume that risk once you enter.",

So it\u2019s not about where the photo is being shared, it\u2019s about the photo itself having a location attached to it. And I\u2019m the same way. I like to have the location map thing in my photo albums but had to do away with it. I\u2019m not sure how to get around it. I think sometimes if you edit a pic on a picture editing app or whatever, and then you save the new version that the location does not stay tagged. I faintly remember that happening in the past.

Still though, actual abuse = actual actual, yet if you\u2019re thinking of sex work because you don\u2019t have what your Tiktok friends have, you have something else coming in life. Honestly, I wish that someone had called cps on my dad when me and my siblings were younger, but no one did.. it could\u2019ve transformed my life just having a father figure who wasn\u2019t an abusive alcoholic and also bipolar. If there\u2019s physical and mental abuse in a family, I could see how a young girl would want something stable to lean on because I did, but you can\u2019t look for that in a married man who you find looking for sex. As long as you\u2019re young though, there\u2019s help out there, but once you graduate and move away, it becomes \u201cyour fault\u201d for not moving on from abuse. \n\nTo any young girls who need help, please seek it out.

If there is any indication of money or gifts being exchanged in return of sexual favor then it can easily be seen as child prostitutions, child sexual exploitation, corruption of minor, contributory delinquency of minors, child enticement, unlawful contact with a minor etc. While the specific law would vary by state, there are many laws that prohibit relationship between adult/minor especially if there is an exchange of material gift involves doesn't even have to be money.\n\nAlso, in case of statutory rape its generally strict liability (meaning there is no defense). However, any other law besides that has \"mistake of age\" defense but the burden is on the defendant. In PA, a man was charged with corruption of minor for sex with a 16 years old (16 in the AOC in PA, so Statutory rape law didn't apply) where mistake of age is a defense. He claimed that he thought she was older because she is physically matured. Medical examination was done on the girl and it says she still has some years to develop and the jury also didn't think she looked older than a 16/17 years old. So he was jailed.\n\nI do feel sorry for guys who get duped into dating underage girls, but honestly I am a bit skeptical about being \"duped\" part. About 3 years ago a gun owner on Alabama got charged multiple crime for being with an underage SB even though she was over the age of consent. He tried the defense of \"mistake\" but didn't work because he never checked her ID, she looked young and they never discussed her age. I am not sure if I am sympathetic toward men who get caught with underage girls. Most child predator uses excuses like \"I didn't know\" while they did.",

Child sex trafficking is quite different from child prostitution law. My point was that SRs are often seen as prostitution. While in case of adult prosecutor needs to prove that a money was exchanged for sex, in case of minor as long as there is evidence the adult offered some kinds of gifts, favor or money in exchange for sex can be charged with \"solicitation of minor\"/child prostitution without any money being actually exchanged for sex. The law is different for minors. \n\nI did read the entire post.

Its not federal law but states generally only treat \"statutory rape\" as strict liability while treating all other crime against minor as reasonable standard. Also, I was specifying that the burden of proof for \"mistake of age\" being on the defendant, there are other defense that is not on the defendant depending upon the crime.\n\nAnd, no I am not saying punish anyone who get accused of crime against children. I am saying that why \"I didn't know\" defense often doesn't work in court even if this defense is allowed for certain crime.",

These laws as well as the matter of online solicitation does require that element of \"knowledge\" that the accused knew about the age of the minor. However, the defense require that the accused at least tried to verify that the girl was an adult. If there is evidence that the accused didn't take reasonable measure to find out the age of the person then it could be considered a \"willful ignorance\" or \"ostrich defense\", which would be counted as defense. So, the matter of conviction is really difficult to predict if the DA choose to prosecute. The best case scenario would be DA entering a plea or ch0osing not to prosecute altogether. \n\nAlso, possession of child pornagraphy is not strict liability, it requires knowledge or intent to some extent, but \"sexting\" is a strict liability crime, which makes no sense to me. I do agree that sexting should not be a strict liability and it needs to have close in age exemption. In states like Colorado, 16 years old child can legally have sex with 26 years old man but sexting an 18 years old with put 18 years old in jail. Its absurd to me. Children having sex with an adult is much more harmful then sending bunch of nudes to similar age teen. US law needs a serious reform.",

That's another story. \n\nIn high school 18 years old typically look like young women, but if your friends think 16 years old generally look like college girls then I would find it concerning since considering pedophile/hebephile/ephebeophile genuinely can't distinguish between child and adult.

The law is different for  minors.** \n\nNo, it isn't.  Prostitution charges Federally, and for most states, are written to reflect compensation, not solely hard currency.   You **can** be convicted for providing goods or services in kind.  I can attest to this  first hand as I worked adjacent to an investigation where game meat was provided as the compensation for prostitution services.  Child prostitution simply adds an extra element that must be proven; namely, age. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n **I did read the entire post.** \n\nYou very obviously did not.  We are talking only about statutory rape and child prostitution laws, no other laws.  I stated that statutory rape is almost exclusively a strict liability law...that is, there is no defense if you did the deed.  Manchester pointed out that some (non-prostitution) statutory rape laws do have what is called an affirmative defense, and cited Washington State law.  For reference:\n\n*Cornell Law on Affirmative Defense: This is a* [*defense*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/defense) *in which the* [*defendant*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/defendant) *introduces* [*evidence*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/evidence)*, which, if found to be credible, will negate* [*criminal*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/criminal_law) [*liability* ](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/liability)*or* [*civil liability*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/civil_liability)*, even if it is proven that the defendant committed the alleged acts.* \n\n **. Also, I was specifying that the burden of proof for \"mistake of age\" being on the defendant** \n\nYep, that is what an affirmative defense is.\n\n **affirmative defense\" as a form of statutory defense.** \n\nThese are two different things.  One is not the form of another.  Affirmative defense is above; statutory defense means there is a specific defense to a crime that has been legislated into statute. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n **And, no I am not saying punish anyone who get accused of crime against children.** \n\nOK, good. We agree then.\n\n **I am saying that why \"I didn't know\" defense often doesn't work in court even if this defense is allowed for certain crime.** \n\nIt is kind of unclear what you are trying to say here, but generally speaking ignorance is *never* a valid defense under the law.  I'm sure you might find some obscure case law that proves the exception, but generally speaking, no.",

They are finishing up their physical development and don't even have mental ability to follow through logical sequence to understand future consequence. So, they can't self-govern themselves yet even if they think they do. Nor many of them look like 21 years old. Some do especially with makeup and clothing. But generally this is a sorry ass excuse. The age of majority globally falls between 18-20. for a reason. \n\nFake IDs are not that easy to get and it cost money. Also, minor do get punished for using fake ID. So, they are not off the hook for anything. Minor teenagers are judged as an adult when they are few month shy from 18 and have done something serious like school shooting, murder, rape etc. I don't think minors should be able to screw over other lives but if an adult take a little precaution he/she can easily avoid that.",

He was a video game creator who got charged for meeting a 16 year old on seeking. Problem is she had lied and said she was 20. Now almost a year later almost all charges were dropped, but it still likely completely ruined his life. There is a good Reddit thread where he responds directly with his side of the story and it is absolutely disgusting what happened to him.

Its unfortunate that his job makes it tough, but thats just part of the deal. He has to adapt to that. Thankfully it was just communication and nothing else.",

I feel as though I would like to protect young women from entering into a world they have no way to conceptualize (I\u2019m generalizing of course). \n\nI can see what that may be an unpopular opinion, but as an older SB I am not jealous of the attention 18 year olds get. It\u2019s a different kind of attention than I get, and I\u2019m grateful for that because I find the attention I get more rewarding. I like being appreciated for my intellect and life experience, and I get attention for that. That makes me feel good.",

And no - she was not still in highschool.\n\nHer reason - when she created her account, and had it set at 18 - she got lots of \"weirdos/scumbags\".  Instead, she ended up changing it to 20, hiding her profile, and favoriting profiles.\n\nSo - depending on the situation, there might be a valid reason for doing it.",

I will say however, it's not dumb to assume 16, 17, even 18 and 19 year olds don't know better. Grasping that something is right or wrong, sure, but understanding the actual consequences it could hold for the other parties involved? No. Many adults can barely think outside of themselves so how are we gonna ask that of a teenager? To me its kind of how you don't realize you were a dick if a child till you have child. At the end of the day, whether its fair or not, the law will always be on their side and SDs need to do their due diligence to filter as best possible to set themselves up for success. The bowl is risky business and you assume that risk once you enter.",

So it\u2019s not about where the photo is being shared, it\u2019s about the photo itself having a location attached to it. And I\u2019m the same way. I like to have the location map thing in my photo albums but had to do away with it. I\u2019m not sure how to get around it. I think sometimes if you edit a pic on a picture editing app or whatever, and then you save the new version that the location does not stay tagged. I faintly remember that happening in the past.

If there is any indication of money or gifts being exchanged in return of sexual favor then it can easily be seen as child prostitutions, child sexual exploitation, corruption of minor, contributory delinquency of minors, child enticement, unlawful contact with a minor etc. While the specific law would vary by state, there are many laws that prohibit relationship between adult/minor especially if there is an exchange of material gift involves doesn't even have to be money.\n\nAlso, in case of statutory rape its generally strict liability (meaning there is no defense). However, any other law besides that has \"mistake of age\" defense but the burden is on the defendant. In PA, a man was charged with corruption of minor for sex with a 16 years old (16 in the AOC in PA, so Statutory rape law didn't apply) where mistake of age is a defense. He claimed that he thought she was older because she is physically matured. Medical examination was done on the girl and it says she still has some years to develop and the jury also didn't think she looked older than a 16/17 years old. So he was jailed.\n\nI do feel sorry for guys who get duped into dating underage girls, but honestly I am a bit skeptical about being \"duped\" part. About 3 years ago a gun owner on Alabama got charged multiple crime for being with an underage SB even though she was over the age of consent. He tried the defense of \"mistake\" but didn't work because he never checked her ID, she looked young and they never discussed her age. I am not sure if I am sympathetic toward men who get caught with underage girls. Most child predator uses excuses like \"I didn't know\" while they did.",

Child sex trafficking is quite different from child prostitution law. My point was that SRs are often seen as prostitution. While in case of adult prosecutor needs to prove that a money was exchanged for sex, in case of minor as long as there is evidence the adult offered some kinds of gifts, favor or money in exchange for sex can be charged with \"solicitation of minor\"/child prostitution without any money being actually exchanged for sex. The law is different for minors. \n\nI did read the entire post.

Its not federal law but states generally only treat \"statutory rape\" as strict liability while treating all other crime against minor as reasonable standard. Also, I was specifying that the burden of proof for \"mistake of age\" being on the defendant, there are other defense that is not on the defendant depending upon the crime.\n\nAnd, no I am not saying punish anyone who get accused of crime against children. I am saying that why \"I didn't know\" defense often doesn't work in court even if this defense is allowed for certain crime.",

These laws as well as the matter of online solicitation does require that element of \"knowledge\" that the accused knew about the age of the minor. However, the defense require that the accused at least tried to verify that the girl was an adult. If there is evidence that the accused didn't take reasonable measure to find out the age of the person then it could be considered a \"willful ignorance\" or \"ostrich defense\", which would be counted as defense. So, the matter of conviction is really difficult to predict if the DA choose to prosecute. The best case scenario would be DA entering a plea or ch0osing not to prosecute altogether. \n\nAlso, possession of child pornagraphy is not strict liability, it requires knowledge or intent to some extent, but \"sexting\" is a strict liability crime, which makes no sense to me. I do agree that sexting should not be a strict liability and it needs to have close in age exemption. In states like Colorado, 16 years old child can legally have sex with 26 years old man but sexting an 18 years old with put 18 years old in jail. Its absurd to me. Children having sex with an adult is much more harmful then sending bunch of nudes to similar age teen. US law needs a serious reform.",

Not to mention, the number of kids being targeted for child prostitutions is higher than number of kids who are just plain self-destructive. \n\n Even if these minor girls are signing for SA, any adult men needs to leave them alone as soon they learn their age or they reasonably look young.

I think its normal to be confused between 17-19 years old as they are all late teen even though 17 is a minor. Occasionally, I have seen 16 years boys and girls looking old enough to be passed for 20 something. Likewise, It is possible for a 21 years old to be passed as an older looking 16 years old kid. A lot of ephebophile uses childlike looking young women as a surrogate for their actual attraction toward actual children. That's another story. \n\nIn high school 18 years old typically look like young women, but if your friends think 16 years old generally look like college girls then I would find it concerning since considering pedophile/hebephile/ephebeophile genuinely can't distinguish between child and adult. This is another reason why mistake of age is not allowed because a lot child predaotrs are not malicious, they genuienly believe the kids looked older and that they are in \"love\". Read the book \"lolita\" its a great  insight in the mind of a pedophile who sees himself as the victim.",

The law is different for  minors.** \n\nNo, it isn't.  Prostitution charges Federally, and for most states, are written to reflect compensation, not solely hard currency.   You **can** be convicted for providing goods or services in kind.  I can attest to this  first hand as I worked adjacent to an investigation where game meat was provided as the compensation for prostitution services.  Child prostitution simply adds an extra element that must be proven; namely, age. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n **I did read the entire post.** \n\nYou very obviously did not.  We are talking only about statutory rape and child prostitution laws, no other laws.  I stated that statutory rape is almost exclusively a strict liability law...that is, there is no defense if you did the deed.  Manchester pointed out that some (non-prostitution) statutory rape laws do have what is called an affirmative defense, and cited Washington State law.  For reference:\n\n*Cornell Law on Affirmative Defense: This is a* [*defense*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/defense) *in which the* [*defendant*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/defendant) *introduces* [*evidence*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/evidence)*, which, if found to be credible, will negate* [*criminal*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/criminal_law) [*liability* ](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/liability)*or* [*civil liability*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/civil_liability)*, even if it is proven that the defendant committed the alleged acts.* \n\n **. Also, I was specifying that the burden of proof for \"mistake of age\" being on the defendant** \n\nYep, that is what an affirmative defense is.\n\n **affirmative defense\" as a form of statutory defense.** \n\nThese are two different things.  One is not the form of another.  Affirmative defense is above; statutory defense means there is a specific defense to a crime that has been legislated into statute. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n **And, no I am not saying punish anyone who get accused of crime against children.** \n\nOK, good. We agree then.\n\n **I am saying that why \"I didn't know\" defense often doesn't work in court even if this defense is allowed for certain crime.** \n\nIt is kind of unclear what you are trying to say here, but generally speaking ignorance is *never* a valid defense under the law.  I'm sure you might find some obscure case law that proves the exception, but generally speaking, no.",

And no - she was not still in highschool.\n\nHer reason - when she created her account, and had it set at 18 - she got lots of \"weirdos/scumbags\".  Instead, she ended up changing it to 20, hiding her profile, and favoriting profiles.\n\nSo - depending on the situation, there might be a valid reason for doing it.",

So it\u2019s not about where the photo is being shared, it\u2019s about the photo itself having a location attached to it. And I\u2019m the same way. I like to have the location map thing in my photo albums but had to do away with it. I\u2019m not sure how to get around it. I think sometimes if you edit a pic on a picture editing app or whatever, and then you save the new version that the location does not stay tagged. I faintly remember that happening in the past. But I ended up just turning off location for photos altogether to avoid any risk.",

If there is any indication of money or gifts being exchanged in return of sexual favor then it can easily be seen as child prostitutions, child sexual exploitation, corruption of minor, contributory delinquency of minors, child enticement, unlawful contact with a minor etc. While the specific law would vary by state, there are many laws that prohibit relationship between adult/minor especially if there is an exchange of material gift involves doesn't even have to be money.\n\nAlso, in case of statutory rape its generally strict liability (meaning there is no defense). However, any other law besides that has \"mistake of age\" defense but the burden is on the defendant. In PA, a man was charged with corruption of minor for sex with a 16 years old (16 in the AOC in PA, so Statutory rape law didn't apply) where mistake of age is a defense. He claimed that he thought she was older because she is physically matured. Medical examination was done on the girl and it says she still has some years to develop and the jury also didn't think she looked older than a 16/17 years old. So he was jailed.\n\nI do feel sorry for guys who get duped into dating underage girls, but honestly I am a bit skeptical about being \"duped\" part. About 3 years ago a gun owner on Alabama got charged multiple crime for being with an underage SB even though she was over the age of consent. He tried the defense of \"mistake\" but didn't work because he never checked her ID, she looked young and they never discussed her age. I am not sure if I am sympathetic toward men who get caught with underage girls. Most child predator uses excuses like \"I didn't know\" while they did.",

Child sex trafficking is quite different from child prostitution law. My point was that SRs are often seen as prostitution. While in case of adult prosecutor needs to prove that a money was exchanged for sex, in case of minor as long as there is evidence the adult offered some kinds of gifts, favor or money in exchange for sex can be charged with \"solicitation of minor\"/child prostitution without any money being actually exchanged for sex. The law is different for minors. \n\nI did read the entire post. You claimed that there are \"affirmative defense\" as a form of statutory defense. \n\n> I would note that this is an affirmative defense, that is, the burden of proof falls on the person being charged, not the state. \n\nI pointed out that there is no \"affirmative defense\" for \"statutory rape\" (may be in Utah), but there is a \"mistake of age defense\" for OTHER statutory crimes besides the \"rape\". Its not federal law but states generally only treat \"statutory rape\" as strict liability while treating all other crime against minor as reasonable standard. Also, I was specifying that the burden of proof for \"mistake of age\" being on the defendant, there are other defense that is not on the defendant depending upon the crime.\n\nAnd, no I am not saying punish anyone who get accused of crime against children. I am saying that why \"I didn't know\" defense often doesn't work in court even if this defense is allowed for certain crime.",

Even implicitly talking sexually with a minor online, say roleplaying, is illegal of course, but if minor was on an adult site posing as a 20 year old that again wouldn\u2019t hold up.\n\nYou can\u2019t (or maybe I should say shouldn\u2019t) throw someone in jail when there was no intent to commit a crime.

Throwing someone\u2019s 20 year old boyfriend in jail for ten years because he got a nude snap from his 17 year old girlfriend is asinine, just like it would be insane to go out and throw any guy in jail who watches a porn of a girl who turned out to be 17 but posed as 18.",

These laws as well as the matter of online solicitation does require that element of \"knowledge\" that the accused knew about the age of the minor. However, the defense require that the accused at least tried to verify that the girl was an adult. If there is evidence that the accused didn't take reasonable measure to find out the age of the person then it could be considered a \"willful ignorance\" or \"ostrich defense\", which would be counted as defense. So, the matter of conviction is really difficult to predict if the DA choose to prosecute. The best case scenario would be DA entering a plea or ch0osing not to prosecute altogether. \n\nAlso, possession of child pornagraphy is not strict liability, it requires knowledge or intent to some extent, but \"sexting\" is a strict liability crime, which makes no sense to me. I do agree that sexting should not be a strict liability and it needs to have close in age exemption. In states like Colorado, 16 years old child can legally have sex with 26 years old man but sexting an 18 years old with put 18 years old in jail. Its absurd to me. Children having sex with an adult is much more harmful then sending bunch of nudes to similar age teen. US law needs a serious reform.",

That's another story. \n\nIn high school 18 years old typically look like young women, but if your friends think 16 years old generally look like college girls then I would find it concerning since considering pedophile/hebephile/ephebeophile genuinely can't distinguish between child and adult. This is another reason why mistake of age is not allowed because a lot child predaotrs are not malicious, they genuienly believe the kids looked older and that they are in \"love\".

The law is different for  minors.** \n\nNo, it isn't.  Prostitution charges Federally, and for most states, are written to reflect compensation, not solely hard currency.   You **can** be convicted for providing goods or services in kind.  I can attest to this  first hand as I worked adjacent to an investigation where game meat was provided as the compensation for prostitution services.  Child prostitution simply adds an extra element that must be proven; namely, age. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n **I did read the entire post.** \n\nYou very obviously did not.  We are talking only about statutory rape and child prostitution laws, no other laws.  I stated that statutory rape is almost exclusively a strict liability law...that is, there is no defense if you did the deed.  Manchester pointed out that some (non-prostitution) statutory rape laws do have what is called an affirmative defense, and cited Washington State law.  For reference:\n\n*Cornell Law on Affirmative Defense: This is a* [*defense*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/defense) *in which the* [*defendant*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/defendant) *introduces* [*evidence*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/evidence)*, which, if found to be credible, will negate* [*criminal*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/criminal_law) [*liability* ](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/liability)*or* [*civil liability*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/civil_liability)*, even if it is proven that the defendant committed the alleged acts.* \n\n **. Also, I was specifying that the burden of proof for \"mistake of age\" being on the defendant** \n\nYep, that is what an affirmative defense is.\n\n **affirmative defense\" as a form of statutory defense.** \n\nThese are two different things.  One is not the form of another.  Affirmative defense is above; statutory defense means there is a specific defense to a crime that has been legislated into statute. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n **And, no I am not saying punish anyone who get accused of crime against children.** \n\nOK, good. We agree then.\n\n **I am saying that why \"I didn't know\" defense often doesn't work in court even if this defense is allowed for certain crime.** \n\nIt is kind of unclear what you are trying to say here, but generally speaking ignorance is *never* a valid defense under the law.  I'm sure you might find some obscure case law that proves the exception, but generally speaking, no.",

Child sex trafficking is quite different from child prostitution law. My point was that SRs are often seen as prostitution. While in case of adult prosecutor needs to prove that a money was exchanged for sex, in case of minor as long as there is evidence the adult offered some kinds of gifts, favor or money in exchange for sex can be charged with \"solicitation of minor\"/child prostitution without any money being actually exchanged for sex. The law is different for minors. \n\nI did read the entire post. You claimed that there are \"affirmative defense\" as a form of statutory defense. \n\n> I would note that this is an affirmative defense, that is, the burden of proof falls on the person being charged, not the state. \n\nI pointed out that there is no \"affirmative defense\" for \"statutory rape\" (may be in Utah), but there is a \"mistake of age defense\" for OTHER statutory crimes besides the \"rape\". Its not federal law but states generally only treat \"statutory rape\" as strict liability while treating all other crime against minor as reasonable standard. Also, I was specifying that the burden of proof for \"mistake of age\" being on the defendant, there are other defense that is not on the defendant depending upon the crime.\n\nAnd, no I am not saying punish anyone who get accused of crime against children. I am saying that why \"I didn't know\" defense often doesn't work in court even if this defense is allowed for certain crime.",

It\u2019s why I have a huge issue with strict liability crimes when it comes to age related sex crimes, especially in the internet age. Throwing someone\u2019s 20 year old boyfriend in jail for ten years because he got a nude snap from his 17 year old girlfriend is asinine, just like it would be insane to go out and throw any guy in jail who watches a porn of a girl who turned out to be 17 but posed as 18.",

These laws as well as the matter of online solicitation does require that element of \"knowledge\" that the accused knew about the age of the minor. However, the defense require that the accused at least tried to verify that the girl was an adult. If there is evidence that the accused didn't take reasonable measure to find out the age of the person then it could be considered a \"willful ignorance\" or \"ostrich defense\", which would be counted as defense. So, the matter of conviction is really difficult to predict if the DA choose to prosecute. The best case scenario would be DA entering a plea or ch0osing not to prosecute altogether. \n\nAlso, possession of child pornagraphy is not strict liability, it requires knowledge or intent to some extent, but \"sexting\" is a strict liability crime, which makes no sense to me. I do agree that sexting should not be a strict liability and it needs to have close in age exemption. In states like Colorado, 16 years old child can legally have sex with 26 years old man but sexting an 18 years old with put 18 years old in jail. Its absurd to me. Children having sex with an adult is much more harmful then sending bunch of nudes to similar age teen. US law needs a serious reform.",

I think its normal to be confused between 17-19 years old as they are all late teen even though 17 is a minor. Occasionally, I have seen 16 years boys and girls looking old enough to be passed for 20 something. Likewise, It is possible for a 21 years old to be passed as an older looking 16 years old kid. A lot of ephebophile uses childlike looking young women as a surrogate for their actual attraction toward actual children. That's another story. \n\nIn high school 18 years old typically look like young women, but if your friends think 16 years old generally look like college girls then I would find it concerning since considering pedophile/hebephile/ephebeophile genuinely can't distinguish between child and adult. This is another reason why mistake of age is not allowed because a lot child predaotrs are not malicious, they genuienly believe the kids looked older and that they are in \"love\". Read the book \"lolita\" its a great  insight in the mind of a pedophile who sees himself as the victim.",

The law is different for  minors.** \n\nNo, it isn't.  Prostitution charges Federally, and for most states, are written to reflect compensation, not solely hard currency.   You **can** be convicted for providing goods or services in kind.  I can attest to this  first hand as I worked adjacent to an investigation where game meat was provided as the compensation for prostitution services.  Child prostitution simply adds an extra element that must be proven; namely, age. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n **I did read the entire post.** \n\nYou very obviously did not.  We are talking only about statutory rape and child prostitution laws, no other laws.  I stated that statutory rape is almost exclusively a strict liability law...that is, there is no defense if you did the deed.  Manchester pointed out that some (non-prostitution) statutory rape laws do have what is called an affirmative defense, and cited Washington State law.  For reference:\n\n*Cornell Law on Affirmative Defense: This is a* [*defense*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/defense) *in which the* [*defendant*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/defendant) *introduces* [*evidence*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/evidence)*, which, if found to be credible, will negate* [*criminal*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/criminal_law) [*liability* ](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/liability)*or* [*civil liability*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/civil_liability)*, even if it is proven that the defendant committed the alleged acts.* \n\n **. Also, I was specifying that the burden of proof for \"mistake of age\" being on the defendant** \n\nYep, that is what an affirmative defense is.\n\n **affirmative defense\" as a form of statutory defense.** \n\nThese are two different things.  One is not the form of another.  Affirmative defense is above; statutory defense means there is a specific defense to a crime that has been legislated into statute. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n **And, no I am not saying punish anyone who get accused of crime against children.** \n\nOK, good. We agree then.\n\n **I am saying that why \"I didn't know\" defense often doesn't work in court even if this defense is allowed for certain crime.** \n\nIt is kind of unclear what you are trying to say here, but generally speaking ignorance is *never* a valid defense under the law.  I'm sure you might find some obscure case law that proves the exception, but generally speaking, no.",

Child sex trafficking is quite different from child prostitution law. My point was that SRs are often seen as prostitution. While in case of adult prosecutor needs to prove that a money was exchanged for sex, in case of minor as long as there is evidence the adult offered some kinds of gifts, favor or money in exchange for sex can be charged with \"solicitation of minor\"/child prostitution without any money being actually exchanged for sex. The law is different for minors. \n\nI did read the entire post. You claimed that there are \"affirmative defense\" as a form of statutory defense. \n\n> I would note that this is an affirmative defense, that is, the burden of proof falls on the person being charged, not the state. \n\nI pointed out that there is no \"affirmative defense\" for \"statutory rape\" (may be in Utah), but there is a \"mistake of age defense\" for OTHER statutory crimes besides the \"rape\". Its not federal law but states generally only treat \"statutory rape\" as strict liability while treating all other crime against minor as reasonable standard. Also, I was specifying that the burden of proof for \"mistake of age\" being on the defendant, there are other defense that is not on the defendant depending upon the crime.\n\nAnd, no I am not saying punish anyone who get accused of crime against children. I am saying that why \"I didn't know\" defense often doesn't work in court even if this defense is allowed for certain crime.",

Even implicitly talking sexually with a minor online, say roleplaying, is illegal of course, but if minor was on an adult site posing as a 20 year old that again wouldn\u2019t hold up.\n\nYou can\u2019t (or maybe I should say shouldn\u2019t) throw someone in jail when there was no intent to commit a crime. It\u2019s why I have a huge issue with strict liability crimes when it comes to age related sex crimes, especially in the internet age. Throwing someone\u2019s 20 year old boyfriend in jail for ten years because he got a nude snap from his 17 year old girlfriend is asinine, just like it would be insane to go out and throw any guy in jail who watches a porn of a girl who turned out to be 17 but posed as 18.",

These laws as well as the matter of online solicitation does require that element of \"knowledge\" that the accused knew about the age of the minor. However, the defense require that the accused at least tried to verify that the girl was an adult. If there is evidence that the accused didn't take reasonable measure to find out the age of the person then it could be considered a \"willful ignorance\" or \"ostrich defense\", which would be counted as defense. So, the matter of conviction is really difficult to predict if the DA choose to prosecute. The best case scenario would be DA entering a plea or ch0osing not to prosecute altogether. \n\nAlso, possession of child pornagraphy is not strict liability, it requires knowledge or intent to some extent, but \"sexting\" is a strict liability crime, which makes no sense to me. I do agree that sexting should not be a strict liability and it needs to have close in age exemption. In states like Colorado, 16 years old child can legally have sex with 26 years old man but sexting an 18 years old with put 18 years old in jail. Its absurd to me. Children having sex with an adult is much more harmful then sending bunch of nudes to similar age teen. US law needs a serious reform.",

Not to mention, the number of kids being targeted for child prostitutions is higher than number of kids who are just plain self-destructive. \n\n Even if these minor girls are signing for SA, any adult men needs to leave them alone as soon they learn their age or they reasonably look young. Though, to increase fairness I think \"mistake of age\" should be widened and consider the possibility that on the internet kids can appear to look older even though in reality they look young.",

Occasionally, I have seen 16 years boys and girls looking old enough to be passed for 20 something. Likewise, It is possible for a 21 years old to be passed as an older looking 16 years old kid. A lot of ephebophile uses childlike looking young women as a surrogate for their actual attraction toward actual children. That's another story. \n\nIn high school 18 years old typically look like young women, but if your friends think 16 years old generally look like college girls then I would find it concerning since considering pedophile/hebephile/ephebeophile genuinely can't distinguish between child and adult. This is another reason why mistake of age is not allowed because a lot child predaotrs are not malicious, they genuienly believe the kids looked older and that they are in \"love\". Read the book \"lolita\" its a great  insight in the mind of a pedophile who sees himself as the victim.",

The law is different for  minors.** \n\nNo, it isn't.  Prostitution charges Federally, and for most states, are written to reflect compensation, not solely hard currency.   You **can** be convicted for providing goods or services in kind.  I can attest to this  first hand as I worked adjacent to an investigation where game meat was provided as the compensation for prostitution services.  Child prostitution simply adds an extra element that must be proven; namely, age. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n **I did read the entire post.** \n\nYou very obviously did not.  We are talking only about statutory rape and child prostitution laws, no other laws.  I stated that statutory rape is almost exclusively a strict liability law...that is, there is no defense if you did the deed.  Manchester pointed out that some (non-prostitution) statutory rape laws do have what is called an affirmative defense, and cited Washington State law.  For reference:\n\n*Cornell Law on Affirmative Defense: This is a* [*defense*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/defense) *in which the* [*defendant*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/defendant) *introduces* [*evidence*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/evidence)*, which, if found to be credible, will negate* [*criminal*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/criminal_law) [*liability* ](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/liability)*or* [*civil liability*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/civil_liability)*, even if it is proven that the defendant committed the alleged acts.* \n\n **. Also, I was specifying that the burden of proof for \"mistake of age\" being on the defendant** \n\nYep, that is what an affirmative defense is.\n\n **affirmative defense\" as a form of statutory defense.** \n\nThese are two different things.  One is not the form of another.  Affirmative defense is above; statutory defense means there is a specific defense to a crime that has been legislated into statute. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n **And, no I am not saying punish anyone who get accused of crime against children.** \n\nOK, good. We agree then.\n\n **I am saying that why \"I didn't know\" defense often doesn't work in court even if this defense is allowed for certain crime.** \n\nIt is kind of unclear what you are trying to say here, but generally speaking ignorance is *never* a valid defense under the law.  I'm sure you might find some obscure case law that proves the exception, but generally speaking, no.",

As long as you\u2019re young though, there\u2019s help out there, but once you graduate and move away, it becomes \u201cyour fault\u201d for not moving on from abuse. \n\nTo any young girls who need help, please seek it out. I love you tremendously, and you\u2019re not alone.",

Even implicitly talking sexually with a minor online, say roleplaying, is illegal of course, but if minor was on an adult site posing as a 20 year old that again wouldn\u2019t hold up.\n\nYou can\u2019t (or maybe I should say shouldn\u2019t) throw someone in jail when there was no intent to commit a crime. It\u2019s why I have a huge issue with strict liability crimes when it comes to age related sex crimes, especially in the internet age. Throwing someone\u2019s 20 year old boyfriend in jail for ten years because he got a nude snap from his 17 year old girlfriend is asinine, just like it would be insane to go out and throw any guy in jail who watches a porn of a girl who turned out to be 17 but posed as 18.",

Occasionally, I have seen 16 years boys and girls looking old enough to be passed for 20 something. Likewise, It is possible for a 21 years old to be passed as an older looking 16 years old kid. A lot of ephebophile uses childlike looking young women as a surrogate for their actual attraction toward actual children. That's another story. \n\nIn high school 18 years old typically look like young women, but if your friends think 16 years old generally look like college girls then I would find it concerning since considering pedophile/hebephile/ephebeophile genuinely can't distinguish between child and adult. This is another reason why mistake of age is not allowed because a lot child predaotrs are not malicious, they genuienly believe the kids looked older and that they are in \"love\".

The law is different for  minors.** \n\nNo, it isn't.  Prostitution charges Federally, and for most states, are written to reflect compensation, not solely hard currency.   You **can** be convicted for providing goods or services in kind.  I can attest to this  first hand as I worked adjacent to an investigation where game meat was provided as the compensation for prostitution services.  Child prostitution simply adds an extra element that must be proven; namely, age. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n **I did read the entire post.** \n\nYou very obviously did not.  We are talking only about statutory rape and child prostitution laws, no other laws.  I stated that statutory rape is almost exclusively a strict liability law...that is, there is no defense if you did the deed.  Manchester pointed out that some (non-prostitution) statutory rape laws do have what is called an affirmative defense, and cited Washington State law.  For reference:\n\n*Cornell Law on Affirmative Defense: This is a* [*defense*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/defense) *in which the* [*defendant*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/defendant) *introduces* [*evidence*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/evidence)*, which, if found to be credible, will negate* [*criminal*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/criminal_law) [*liability* ](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/liability)*or* [*civil liability*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/civil_liability)*, even if it is proven that the defendant committed the alleged acts.* \n\n **. Also, I was specifying that the burden of proof for \"mistake of age\" being on the defendant** \n\nYep, that is what an affirmative defense is.\n\n **affirmative defense\" as a form of statutory defense.** \n\nThese are two different things.  One is not the form of another.  Affirmative defense is above; statutory defense means there is a specific defense to a crime that has been legislated into statute. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n **And, no I am not saying punish anyone who get accused of crime against children.** \n\nOK, good. We agree then.\n\n **I am saying that why \"I didn't know\" defense often doesn't work in court even if this defense is allowed for certain crime.** \n\nIt is kind of unclear what you are trying to say here, but generally speaking ignorance is *never* a valid defense under the law.  I'm sure you might find some obscure case law that proves the exception, but generally speaking, no.",

This is another reason why mistake of age is not allowed because a lot child predaotrs are not malicious, they genuienly believe the kids looked older and that they are in \"love\".
