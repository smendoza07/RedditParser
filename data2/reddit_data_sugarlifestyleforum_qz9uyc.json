    "body": "I had a meet and greet last week that went very well. Not a looker, but super nice guy, chemistry was apparent. He bought lunch and we just chatted for an hour or so, then he took me home.\n\nWe text a bit and plan for an afternoon tomorrow. As soon as the plan is made, he starts asking for nudes, demands I open the door naked, and insists on rough play, something I\u2019m not comfortable with. We previously agreed to lunch and a couple hours of play time, but he said we could just skip lunch and he\u2019ll get something afterwards. I was like ok so you have ALL these demands and then you can\u2019t even provide a meal? \n\nSo I texted this: \n\nI actually don't think I'm going to meet you. I feel uncomfortable now. I am getting the impression my boundaries don't matter and you're viewing me as an escort service. \n\nI ask you not to leave bruises, you say there may be bruises anyway. I offer a time frame for lunch and play, you remove lunch to try to get an extra hour of play. You assume I will be comfortable opening the door naked after only meeting you once.\n\nI'm not sure how many times you've done this or what kind of women you've been meeting, but these are all major red flags. I encourage you to learn to express your desires in a less entitled manner. I may be looking for financial assistance, but I'm still a human. \n\nUnfortunately, the risk I am sensing is not worth the projected reward. \n\n\nJust venting because this is the first dip back in the bowl after a long break and I already remember why I quit in the first place. How do I weed these people out earlier? This behavior didn\u2019t show up in person at all at the meet and greet.",

When someone who falls in that category meets a like-minded person, it's like locating a long-lost sibling; it's wonderful.  Alas, the odds of finding people\u2014who \u2018get it\u2019 and have the capacity & desire to honor that difference & pay it in kind\u2014are very slim.  The odds are thinner yet where money is to change hands and posturing is rampant (SRs).\n\nAlso, I do not see a fundamental opposition between being personable and being reserved; only the way you erect & enforce your boundaries changes; that sounds fairly reasonable.  Anyone who'll appreciate your outgoing attributes will like them even more if they discover them fully over time.  Plus: they'll think themselves a genius for having discovered those treasures about your personality.  Ha!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Maybe I\u2019ll take a friend on a pretend meet and greet to practice or something haha\n\nShoot me a message with penchants of yours and impulses you observe in yourself, and I'll reply with some feedback as to the way they might be construed in the bowl\u2014if you want.",

Think about all of the things you noticed about him and what he told you.  Do this for every other prospective daddy or boyfriend you\u2019ve come across. Of course, you\u2019ve probably already done this. It\u2019s helpful, but still kind of superficial. \n\nMore importantly, pay attention to every little thing a guy does. How he walks, moves, eats, drinks, drives etc. IMO, what a person does is often more telling than anything they can say or stick into a profile. Does he enter your personal space?  If so, in what way? Was he playfully testing you or was it a little desperate or menacing?  The only difference between a serial killer and a nice guy saying hi might be where they are standing relative to the trunk of their car, so every little detail could help. People write whole books on this sorta stuff and many are well worth the read. Pay attention to these things and let it go to your gut. Then follow your gut going forward. \n\nI would bet he did something that night that was a little bit off since it sounds like you had a pretty long meet and greet. You mentioned he took you home. Was this his idea?  I can see that as something slightly invasive. I hope you didn\u2019t give up where you live.  You also mentioned that chemistry was apparent. Do you have a history of being attracted to assholes? If so, what about them might you not be spotting from a mile away. \n\nThen again, maybe you played it perfectly and you just have to deal with a few bad guys before you find another good one. \n\nDO NOT, ask for money for a meet and greet, at least not to weed people out. It will only weed out the guys who aren\u2019t desperate, who are the ones you probably want to meet anyways.",
