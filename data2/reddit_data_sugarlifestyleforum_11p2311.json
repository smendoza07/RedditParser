    "body": "I know it can be difficult for both SBs and SDs to broach the money conversation. I certainly hate talking about the money because I want the focus to be on our relationship. But I recognize that for many it's untenable to go into an arrangement without having any firm numbers on the table.\n\nEDIT: While these were taken from an advanced negotiation class all about money negotiations, this post is specifically about how to bring up the topic of money. It's NOT about how to negotiate an allowance. \n\nSome of these methods overlap with others, but it's nice to have a lot of tools in your toolbox depending on your situation. The names are pretty self explanatory, so I'll just offer some sample text relating to an arrangement setting following each name.\n\n1. **Make an offer**\"I'd be happy to provide an allowance of X\"\"What do you think about meeting weekly for a PPM of X?\"\n2. **Frame as a joint dilemma**\"One thing we'll have to think about is how much the allowance should be\"\n3. **Ask to be educated**\"I'd love to hear more about how you think about the financial side of things\"\n4. **Invite or propose a process**\"How do you want to go about discussing allowance?\"\"Why don't we lay out a few ways we might think about this and then we can decide which makes the most sense\"\n5. **Suggest relevant criteria**\"It seems to me that it makes sense to provide an allowance that is equivalent to a one bedroom apartment in our area\"\"When I think about what allowance would be adequate, I would be interested in knowing what your monthly expenses are\"\n6. **Suggest a range**\"I would be comfortable with an amount between X and Y\"\n7. **Two options to choose from**\"I could do a PPM of X to meet weekly or an allowance of Y and we could meet whenever we both want. Which of these appeals to you and makes the most sense?\"\n8. **Ask about the economic ecosystem: assumptions, implicit rules, norms, criteria...**\"Here's something I'm wondering about.... I'm curious because...\"\"How do you think about allowance increases in later years?\"\n9. **Talk about the challenge**\"Here's the dilemma for me: What you're offering/asking for is very reasonable. The challenge is that...\"\n10. **Name the awkwardness. Clarify your purpose**\"I hate to ask about money. I just want to be sure we can get it out of the way so we don't have to talk about it again\"\"I\u2019m worried that If I ask about money, it sounds like I\u2019m only interested in the money.  That\u2019s not true, but it is an important part of the picture because\u2026.\u201d\n\nHope this helps someone :)",

But I very much don't subscribe to Voss's \"my way or the highway\" mentality or that a negotiation is a big game where you need a tactical advantage or manipulation. My view is that a negotiation should be less about making sure my piece of the pie is bigger than someone else's but more about making the pie itself bigger. Increasing value through sharing interests is a big part of my negotiating philosophy. I would be more inclined to recommend books by Roger Fisher/William ury",

Ideally the handling of the discussion leads to a strengthening of the bonds.  It is also an exercise in leadership by both.  \n\nThink of the \"arrangement\"   as creation of a bouquet in a crystal vase.   You are partners in the creation of the arrangement .  If you tussle excessively you will break the vase and in the morning all you will have wilted flowers and broken glass.",
