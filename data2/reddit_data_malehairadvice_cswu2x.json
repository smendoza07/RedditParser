Normally the barber attaches a guard to the clippers that ranges from 1/8\" (a #1) to 1\" or more. \n\nTo my eye it looks like a #3 or #4 tapered down to a #1 on the bottom. For most barbers in the US this would be fairly unambiguous language, but it's still best to bring in the picture.",

I'm definitely not an expert on the english words for hairstylist language, but we do put things onto the clipper for different lengths, just in millimeter. Without this guard, I can go down to 0.8mm on my clipper I have at home. My guards are doublesided, which makes it easy to go back and forth with lengths. Like one side being a 3mm, other a 4mm and so on. Same process but different measurements I guess? That's nice to know",

I don't wanna be a moderator though :P \n\nI find it weird that barbers ignore pictures, as a hairdresser myself, I love when people bring in photos so I can immediately see and think about what I have to do. I guess barbers work differently. I did cut a fair amount of male hair, most of them were regular customers who gave me their usual \"6mm sides, top longer\" talk but new customers either brought in photos or had a consultation about the haircut. Every hair salon/barbershop is different, it's always good to find and keep a regular barber that knows what to do with your hair whenever you come in :)",

Especially if you're in a smaller area with limited barbers. I've been to a number of different barber shops around me, and been through like 10 or 11 barbers. And a few of them have been cutting hair for around 20 years. Guess how many actually went even remotely close to the picture? Fucking 1. And when I asked that guy to shorten the top up a bit to be closer to the picture, the fucker all but buzzed the rest of the hair on the top of my head off.\n\nThe rest don't even do an interpretation of the picture. They just do what they think would \"look better\" than what I showed them.\n\nWith that said, I got extremely lucky that a guy I work with went to barbering school and beauty school and actually has done exactly what I wanted with my hair for the last 6 months. He's the only one I trust to cut my hair now and I will drive however long it takes to get to him so I don't have to go through this bullshit process again. \n\nSorry for the rant. It just frustrates me beyond belief.",

I wish hairdressers/barbers would just do what the client wants or at least make it look the closest to their idea as possible.   \n\n\nI was AFRAID of hairdressers because whenever I said \"just 1-2cm off the split ends\", I ended up with shoulder length hair. Then I became a hairdresser and realized how difficult it can be to understand what a person wants. But people just need to listen and stop doing what their hair/beauty school taught them is \"correct\". I learned in a hair salon that wasn't very up to date with modern cuts and I learned the \"most commonly asked\" haircuts from regular customers. But these haircuts do not apply to every single person. That's how mistakes happen as well.  \n\n\nI'm glad you found someone you can trust now! Once you have someone, never let them go :P",

I don't wanna be a moderator though :P \n\nI find it weird that barbers ignore pictures, as a hairdresser myself, I love when people bring in photos so I can immediately see and think about what I have to do. I guess barbers work differently. I did cut a fair amount of male hair, most of them were regular customers who gave me their usual \"6mm sides, top longer\" talk but new customers either brought in photos or had a consultation about the haircut. Every hair salon/barbershop is different, it's always good to find and keep a regular barber that knows what to do with your hair whenever you come in :)",

Especially if you're in a smaller area with limited barbers. I've been to a number of different barber shops around me, and been through like 10 or 11 barbers. And a few of them have been cutting hair for around 20 years. Guess how many actually went even remotely close to the picture? Fucking 1. And when I asked that guy to shorten the top up a bit to be closer to the picture, the fucker all but buzzed the rest of the hair on the top of my head off.\n\nThe rest don't even do an interpretation of the picture. They just do what they think would \"look better\" than what I showed them.\n\nWith that said, I got extremely lucky that a guy I work with went to barbering school and beauty school and actually has done exactly what I wanted with my hair for the last 6 months. He's the only one I trust to cut my hair now and I will drive however long it takes to get to him so I don't have to go through this bullshit process again. \n\nSorry for the rant. It just frustrates me beyond belief.",

I wish hairdressers/barbers would just do what the client wants or at least make it look the closest to their idea as possible.   \n\n\nI was AFRAID of hairdressers because whenever I said \"just 1-2cm off the split ends\", I ended up with shoulder length hair. Then I became a hairdresser and realized how difficult it can be to understand what a person wants. But people just need to listen and stop doing what their hair/beauty school taught them is \"correct\". I learned in a hair salon that wasn't very up to date with modern cuts and I learned the \"most commonly asked\" haircuts from regular customers. But these haircuts do not apply to every single person. That's how mistakes happen as well.  \n\n\nI'm glad you found someone you can trust now! Once you have someone, never let them go :P",

I'm definitely not an expert on the english words for hairstylist language, but we do put things onto the clipper for different lengths, just in millimeter. Without this guard, I can go down to 0.8mm on my clipper I have at home. My guards are doublesided, which makes it easy to go back and forth with lengths. Like one side being a 3mm, other a 4mm and so on. Same process but different measurements I guess? That's nice to know",

I don't wanna be a moderator though :P \n\nI find it weird that barbers ignore pictures, as a hairdresser myself, I love when people bring in photos so I can immediately see and think about what I have to do. I guess barbers work differently. I did cut a fair amount of male hair, most of them were regular customers who gave me their usual \"6mm sides, top longer\" talk but new customers either brought in photos or had a consultation about the haircut. Every hair salon/barbershop is different, it's always good to find and keep a regular barber that knows what to do with your hair whenever you come in :)",

Especially if you're in a smaller area with limited barbers. I've been to a number of different barber shops around me, and been through like 10 or 11 barbers. And a few of them have been cutting hair for around 20 years. Guess how many actually went even remotely close to the picture? Fucking 1. And when I asked that guy to shorten the top up a bit to be closer to the picture, the fucker all but buzzed the rest of the hair on the top of my head off.\n\nThe rest don't even do an interpretation of the picture. They just do what they think would \"look better\" than what I showed them.\n\nWith that said, I got extremely lucky that a guy I work with went to barbering school and beauty school and actually has done exactly what I wanted with my hair for the last 6 months. He's the only one I trust to cut my hair now and I will drive however long it takes to get to him so I don't have to go through this bullshit process again. \n\nSorry for the rant. It just frustrates me beyond belief.",

He didn't ask should he show the picture to the barber, so if you don't know the length of the sides because you're not an expert then just leave it at that. \n\nYou might not have directly said anything negative about OP but by being Captain obvious you patronised him like he didn't think of showing the picture himself.
