    "body": "To women considering becoming a Sugar Baby\n\nI became a \u201csugar baby\u201d in January, let me tell you about it. This is not for the weak and definitely not for someone who considers themselves emotional. I found myself sugaring at 22, when I realized I had 140k in loans to pay off because of school. This honestly broke my heart because it would take my whole life to pay off working my 40k office job that I had gotten straight out of school. However, this is a whole other topic of conversation. Not a single female would become a sugar baby if they were financially stable and that\u2019s the honest truth. We can lie to ourselves and say oh it\u2019s cause I prefer the way older men treat me or other simple excuses but really no one would be here if there weren\u2019t perks. And I don\u2019t even have to state why the men would be sugar daddies anyways. So I started stripping and sugaring and working my 9-5. Upon meeting these men I quickly realized sugar babies are just fancy pr*stitutes. These SDs have no regard for you, they don\u2019t respect you and want to own you. You would think some would want to genuinely help you and see you flourish. For example I have asked my 5 month long SD for help with my loans, nothing. I have asked him and other old POTs for help with a new business that I have decided to start myself (I did my own website, seo work, and plans) and I was quickly met with resistance. If you are unable to actually help someone out and you can see that they are actively working to help their family and themselves for their future, do not lie to yourself or them. \n\nHe asked if what he has given me is enough for what I needed to purchase. \nFor some price points I\u2019ll tell you. My ppm/allowance is ***. It was*** but overtime he changed it and I wasn\u2019t going to make a big fuss. They do this often and will probably be cause of the oncoming recession. \n\nWe meet maybe once a week. \nThat\u2019s roughly **** a month. \n\n(I removed the number so that this forum won\u2019t take it down. But if you want real numbers it\u2019s around the same or less in the allowance thread)\n\nMy monthly expenses are that and more. Rent, insurance, car payments, and loan payments. I don\u2019t rely on him for all of this however the question baffled me.\n\nThey will try to keep you on a tight leash in terms of finances, so they can have you as long as possible. But trust me this is the fastest way to lose a SB. \n\nTo all my ladies trying to make a path for yourself, please know what you are getting yourself into and do not have any expectations and do not hold any loyalty/respect for these \u201csugar daddies\u201d unless actions follow suit. \n\nSince people are saying \u201cthis is not very common for me\u201d okay, but you\u2019re the 10% Also I refuse to believe that sane people in a happy SR stay on the forum all day. \n\nAnyways if you\u2019re a young SB in NY and want to avoid the \u201cdregs\u201d as someone called it. I will GLADLY message you a list of every shitty SD in my area (NY) with username, photo, name, and number that I have put on a spreadsheet \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f I love you ladies so much and stay safe",

We negotiate allowance or PPM then we only talk about it if there\u2019s a problem. \n\nSome girls, every time they talk to them , their phone is about to be shut off, they need to keep family out of jail, rent is due, all true requests I\u2019ve had.  \n\nIt\u2019s stressful to be hit up for new money all the time.  I\u2019m not looking for more stress.  \n\nAnd guys, let\u2019s be kind.  These are real, three dimensional humans, not sex objects.

But also sounds like you were more focused on making money instead of a connection + money so you ended up with guys that didn't treat you well. \n\nUnless you snag a whale most guys aren't going to give extras other than allowance right away. It takes time to build up to that. \n\nFinally, regarding investing in your business: 1) plenty of guys will tell you they think it's a great business idea even if they think it's horrible so as not to hurt your feelings; and 2) most guys would be hesitant to invest in a business with someone they are dating for multiple reasons. It's just not a good idea.",

I think the current one probably wants me to ask for money, it\u2019s a means some men use to control women actually, subconsciously, I believe. \n\nIf I ask money now from my ex boyfriend, he\u2019d be over joyed. He then will think he has got a chance with me again. \n\nIf I ask money from the last SD, he probably would think I\u2019d be happy to have sex with him while he\u2019s still having his wife (facilitate cheat) .. \n\nIf I ask money from my current SD, he\u2019d think I\u2019d be happy to relocate to Singapore soon. \n\nThe thing is there is no free lunch. People have expectations. You think men offer you financial help and don\u2019t expect things in return? Everyone do, not just men. \n\nThe power dynamic between sexes is always an interesting psychological subject to study. As long as a man desires sex from a woman, the woman Always holds the power. Men offering  financial help is a way of them to balance this power play.",

My ex boyfriend probably is the worst of them all. \n\nWe used to fight over him having sex with other girls. He never cheated to be fair. He told me to my face almost like revenge or torture. \n\nI tried more than once to ghost/escape/disappear/vanish. He always found a way to catch me back. The thing is he didn\u2019t think he was doing anything wrong. He said : You are emotionally over reacting over some cheap whores. What for? You are not going anywhere you are going back to Japan and we will get married. \n\nI felt very uncomfortable hearing this comment. Honestly one girl came to me - she was a famous Japanese socialite - she got pregnant. She asked me to give him to her, like I had an ownership of this man?\ud83d\ude49 \n\nI don\u2019t know what happened in the end. He probably got her an abortion. In Japanese upper class society, if a man is not preparing to marry you, you are just dirt to him. \n\nI didn\u2019t marry him. I still had the wedding band in my jewellery box but I knew we were the wrong fit. Money isn\u2019t everything.

I'll toot my own horn and say that I'm an attractive guy who actually looks 15 years younger than my actual age.  I'm very fit, and have no problem meeting women.  I'm also extremely busy and have no time or patience to deal with someone placing demands on my time. Younger women are also a lot more appreciative than women my age, and lets face it: they look better.  Women my age generally act like you. \n\nThat's why I do this.",

When I turned 18, I enjoyed the company of older men who spoke to me on their level and in return, they spoiled me. I wasn't even aware what a sugar relationship was before. Right now, I'm financially independent because of my full time job and side gigs, a college student getting a degree, the eldest amongst my siblings who funds their studies, and managing a small business. I live in a third world country where most don't stand a chance if they're not clever in life. Yeah life is shit but that's really it, it's unfair. I've met shitty men along the way but guess what, I don't take their word for it every time someone will say they will spoil me. Actions speak louder than words. If they're too pushy or they're wasting my time, I'm done with them. That's it.\n\nDo I sugar for money? Yes. Do I sugar for income? No. Honestly, making sugaring a source of income is the biggest mistake an aspiring sugar baby can make. I like to date someone who can spoil me. That's it. I'm not desperate nor lowering my standards just to meet their needs.\n\nYou're shitting on sugar daddies that literally removes themselves from the \"Johns\". You're shitting on sugar babies that are literally just in it for the actual relationship with someone. I'm sorry you had a bad experience but to shit on others and to make a pseudo-PSA based on your experience only diminishes the sugar relationships that people have.\n\nMy SDs and I have long term relationships and we are all seeking emotional connection. Damn, I'm emotional by nature but I develop thick skin overtime because being sad won't get me anywhere plus it only affects the person I'm with. I'm not happy with my status in life but I'm not complaining, life is literally built like that.\n\nThere are people happy in a sugar relationship but guess what, they can do whatever they want with their time, whether it's to shitpost on a forum, play video games, day trade, wank, or whatever they fuck they want. Again, I'm truly sorry about your bad experience. Sugaring is not really for everyone, I know that from day one. Yes, it's discouraging at some point if you centralized it and make it your own focus in life. If you have other things you can be busy of, then do it. Let other people do their thing to.\n\nAgain, it might be cutthroat on other places but since I live in a third world country, based on my experience, dating someone who can spoil me even if I can pay for everything in my life is truly great. I wish you peace and blessings. Stay safe and sane OP.",

Many schools like the University of Calif offer a guaranteed transfer if you make a minimum GPA. Sadly part of what drives the huge tuition fees are , in the case of California , grossly bloated salaries of both profs and staff. \n\nB.  In more than a decade of involvement I have met a number of SB's whose motivation was not survival cash but escape from the dating life of the 20s.  Thus like most global statements the facts are not in evidence.\n\nC.   Many SB's find benefits well beyond the financial gain\n\nArrangements are like much of life.

Also, examine what \"depend\" means; you can literally be dependent on it, but you can also use the thought of incoming cash flow as an emotional crutch. I think the latter is one that sneaks up on a lot of people.\n\nI wanted to add another thought. You can't trust or depend on *anyone*. That doesn't mean you need to distrust either. Approach with caution, constantly evaluate how someone's words align with their actions. Don't get complacent. And this applies to ALL interpersonal relationships. Friends, SDs, vanilla partners, neighbors, coworkers, your landscaper. People are always changing and we are not privy to how their emotional landscapes shift.\n\nPeople usually end up hurt because they project their own expectations and values onto others.",

Firstly, I'd tackle the student loans before taking on more debt to start a business. I've heard of many stories here on slf of sbs paying off their debt. It just takes time. You claim the sds have been giving you the agreed upon amount, they aren't obligated to give anything more than that. That's the arrangement. He is your SD, not your actual dad. If he's living up to the agreement, he's a reliable and good SD and that's the end of it. You can pay the debt off faster by seeing him more or by seeing more SDs. You can try looking for a whale. You've been at it for 6 months, I'm not sure exactly how quickly you think 140k will be paid off, but it won't be in 6 months. Just keep at it and you'll pay it off soon enough. Good luck.",

Oscar told him, if you want professional feedback, then it's one of the worst things I have ever read.  It sounds cruel - but then Oscar went on to explain why it didn't work.  Stephen - you are trying to sound like me - don't copy me - sound like you - You will be miles ahead of any of your contemporaries and competition.  Oscar added in 2 hours of lessons that Stephen took to heart and which launched him into becoming one of the greatest composers in American Theater.   \nYou have asked for feedback on your business plan.    \nDid you make it clear that you didn't want them to be nice?   \nThat you could take anything harsh they had to say - as long as they were specific and included constructive actions about what you could/should do?   \nTHAT is what Mentoring Looks like.   \n\n\nIt sounds like you want an SD who is able, and willing to mentor you.  As stated by others below - not all SD's are actually capable, or good at mentoring.   \nSome may simply not know how to Mentor.    \nWhen you are looking for new SD's (which it sounds like something you will want to do) - then ask them detailed questions about their work, their businesses and be blunt that one of the things that you are really looking for is someone with a Big Wing that you will be taken under. Those who can will be happy to do so.    \nThose who cannot will next or talk about handbags.   \nUpdate your profile - unless you also want handbags - state that you are not interested in shopping sprees - you want someone who will support your growth as a entrepreneur and budding business owner.   \n\n\nLook for Mentoring to be included in the profiles of potential SD's - ask questions during initial contacts.  Follow up on that topic during the meet and greet.  If you take yourself seriously - so will your new SD.    \nThis is your game to win or lose.    \nYou are 100% right - the other guys Were Jerks!  \nNow you have a new chance to find a Great Guy who WILL Help you - and who Can give you what you really want/need.    \nSure you want/need some financial support to cover your loans, and extra help support in that area would be awesome.  That will be a gift that you earn but indirectly (not a quid-pro-quo).    \nIf you celebrate a Win with your new SD - instead of a fancy shopping spree - tell him you would prefer something with a bit more fiscal responsibility to it - a reduction of your education loan burden.  Shopping sprees in NYC can be in the thousands - what would that do to your loan balance if applied as an extra payment?    \nThis is not an expectation (expect it and it will vanish) - this is a gift that will come when it is given - not before. The best metaphor is the proverbial wet bar of soap.   \n\n\nGood Luck - you can do this   \nYou Can have that which you want.    \nThe world can be your oyster - you get to make it that way.   \n\n\nPS:  Suggestion:  (hot tip from an effective Mentor)   \nGet the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey - the audio book is like $15 - it will change your life if you have not read/heard this book.  I find the audio book easier to use when running around rather than music.",

You don't see how that would come across as a little abrasive?\n\nAs I said, not everything is black and white. It would benefit both your sugaring and business futures to spend more time listening and learning. You're actually completely right that you shouldn't \"expect\" anything from anyone, that's true in sugar and in life. Good luck!",

My ex boyfriend probably is the worst of them all. \n\nWe used to fight over him having sex with other girls. He never cheated to be fair. He told me to my face almost like revenge or torture. \n\nI tried more than once to ghost/escape/disappear/vanish. He always found a way to catch me back. The thing is he didn\u2019t think he was doing anything wrong. He said : You are emotionally over reacting over some cheap whores. What for? You are not going anywhere you are going back to Japan and we will get married. \n\nI felt very uncomfortable hearing this comment. Honestly one girl came to me - she was a famous Japanese socialite - she got pregnant. She asked me to give him to her, like I had an ownership of this man?\ud83d\ude49 \n\nI don\u2019t know what happened in the end. He probably got her an abortion. In Japanese upper class society, if a man is not preparing to marry you, you are just dirt to him. \n\nI didn\u2019t marry him. I still had the wedding band in my jewellery box but I knew we were the wrong fit. Money isn\u2019t everything. It can\u2019t buy you happiness. \n\nHe was my first guy so I was very inexperienced to be fair. Never again.",

I'll toot my own horn and say that I'm an attractive guy who actually looks 15 years younger than my actual age.  I'm very fit, and have no problem meeting women.  I'm also extremely busy and have no time or patience to deal with someone placing demands on my time. Younger women are also a lot more appreciative than women my age, and lets face it: they look better.  Women my age generally act like you. \n\nThat's why I do this.",

Do not sleep with anyone until you've vetted them! Also it would be helpful if you had at least some attraction to them. \n\nI'm just saying, even good SDs aren't necessarily going to clear out your student loans or invest in your business in such a short time interval (and you mentioned asking POTs, any help would be even less likely). It just seems like your expectations were too high entering into sugaring.\n\nBy the way, I was also 22 once, and idealistic.

I'll toot my own horn and say that I'm an attractive guy who actually looks 15 years younger than my actual age.  I'm very fit, and have no problem meeting women.  I'm also extremely busy and have no time or patience to deal with someone placing demands on my time. Younger women are also a lot more appreciative than women my age, and lets face it: they look better.  Women my age generally act like you. \n\nThat's why I do this.",

Do not sleep with anyone until you've vetted them! Also it would be helpful if you had at least some attraction to them. \n\nI'm just saying, even good SDs aren't necessarily going to clear out your student loans or invest in your business in such a short time interval (and you mentioned asking POTs, any help would be even less likely). It just seems like your expectations were too high entering into sugaring.\n\nBy the way, I was also 22 once, and idealistic.

You don't see how that would come across as a little abrasive?\n\nAs I said, not everything is black and white. It would benefit both your sugaring and business futures to spend more time listening and learning. You're actually completely right that you shouldn't \"expect\" anything from anyone, that's true in sugar and in life. Good luck!",
