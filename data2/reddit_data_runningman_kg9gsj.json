The struggles, hardships, injustices he faced during his career took a toll on him but never did shake his convictions and work ethics.\n\nHe brought soo many things to the entertainment industry, over the past 20 years, this is a small appreciation gesture for that.\n\nI hope he enjoys it as much as possible, well deserved !!",

But it gets me kinda sad reading other comments saying that it was just more of a token to him than a real outstanding award. People are saying that there wasn\u2019t really anyone that outshined all this year, and that they gave it to him because he\u2019s on two shows and works hard and it\u2019s about time to just give him one or something. I got sad reading upvotef comments like these because it shouldn\u2019t matter if that\u2019s the case, the award should be given to someone who has clearly demonstrated dedication, devotion, strength and competence in delivering joy to audiences and so the award should definitely go to KJK. To me, I\u2019ve seen him do a tremendous job this year, supporting his friends and comedic channels as well as delivering a good story for audiences to laugh at every time he\u2019s onscreen. I\u2019m proud of him and I just hope that everyone can still see that aside from the year the industry has had.",
