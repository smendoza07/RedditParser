I'm certain he'll just take it all in stride and eventually win everyone over and figure it out on his own... \"\n\n\nAlso I want to know who the hell took care of infant Naruto and when did they decide he was old enough to live on his own with zero supervision...

I know he was supposed to be a \"monster\" or some shit and Shitkura was making a lot of anime noises before he domestically abused her, but all I could think was who the fuck drew this? A child with crayons? He just looked so jarring against all the backdrops and stuff. Not horrifying or anything at all.\n\nBasically I mystery science theatre 3000 Naruto and I'm done with the original series and I'm on like episode 100~ish but it's been a fun ride shitting on some of the cornier stuff like that whole fight. That was probably the lamest part of the series I've seen so far besides the 2 identical angry woman characters with different hair colors knocking each other out simultaneously, but that got me a good laugh at how bad they both sucked at the same time.\n\nDon't even get me started on how the new characters were so lame. Woodchuck and Dollar General Rorschach were some eye rolling stuff for me.\n\nSomehow I still like this children's show though. Anyway, rant over.",

Orochimaru was doing a lot of  human experiments while he was still in the village and it was sanctioned by Danzo when he was working him. If you remember one of the reasons he got chased out was that he had used war orphans - but they were from the same place Danzo was pulling kids for Root (which was how he found Kabuto in the first place).\n\nA part of that human research went towards harvesting Hashirama cells to make Danzos arm. Then there\u2019s also Yamato who was \u201creborn\u201d shortly following Orochimaru exit - but after a series of failed experiments (that must have started prior) with the same technology Danzo had him working on. \n\nI think this is more why Hiruzen acted the way he did - he couldn\u2019t fully blame Orochimaru for all his shit when he was still letting Danzo run free (who did literally everything Oro did and worse, including an assassination attempt)\n\nMy head cannon is Tsunade probably pushed for letting him off. She remembers him growing up so she\u2019d be more likely to believe he was \u201crelatively good\u201d again.  Like how the rest of the world looked at Sasuke as a heinous criminal during the war but Naruto just side-eyed him and said \u201cokay you\u2019re back let\u2019s team up\u201d You see Jiraiya conflicted about killing Orochimaru too - and in the end he did save the current Kage and revive the old ones. When Orochimaru offers himself to Katsuyu there\u2019s a scene where Tsunade looks at his face and she can tell his demeanor is different from before (though to be fair the last time she saw him he was trying to kill her and Shizune)",

When he did succumb to madness, he just focused on achieving his goals, he just has no moral compass, he doesn't care if what he's doing is right or wrong, he just wants to get it done so he can be immortal",

I'm all out of ideas I guess let's just roll with it hopefully he doesn't become a rogue ninja when he finds this out... I'm certain he'll just take it all in stride and eventually win everyone over and figure it out on his own... \"\n\n\nAlso I want to know who the hell took care of infant Naruto and when did they decide he was old enough to live on his own with zero supervision... I can understand the villagers being scared and hiruzen not wanting to confirm kurama was in Naruto but like damn man what? Was he fending for himself at like 2 days old?

I know he was supposed to be a \"monster\" or some shit and Shitkura was making a lot of anime noises before he domestically abused her, but all I could think was who the fuck drew this? A child with crayons? He just looked so jarring against all the backdrops and stuff. Not horrifying or anything at all.\n\nBasically I mystery science theatre 3000 Naruto and I'm done with the original series and I'm on like episode 100~ish but it's been a fun ride shitting on some of the cornier stuff like that whole fight. That was probably the lamest part of the series I've seen so far besides the 2 identical angry woman characters with different hair colors knocking each other out simultaneously, but that got me a good laugh at how bad they both sucked at the same time.\n\nDon't even get me started on how the new characters were so lame. Woodchuck and Dollar General Rorschach were some eye rolling stuff for me.\n\nSomehow I still like this children's show though. Anyway, rant over.",

Orochimaru was doing a lot of  human experiments while he was still in the village and it was sanctioned by Danzo when he was working him. If you remember one of the reasons he got chased out was that he had used war orphans - but they were from the same place Danzo was pulling kids for Root (which was how he found Kabuto in the first place).\n\nA part of that human research went towards harvesting Hashirama cells to make Danzos arm. Then there\u2019s also Yamato who was \u201creborn\u201d shortly following Orochimaru exit - but after a series of failed experiments (that must have started prior) with the same technology Danzo had him working on. \n\nI think this is more why Hiruzen acted the way he did - he couldn\u2019t fully blame Orochimaru for all his shit when he was still letting Danzo run free (who did literally everything Oro did and worse, including an assassination attempt)\n\nMy head cannon is Tsunade probably pushed for letting him off. She remembers him growing up so she\u2019d be more likely to believe he was \u201crelatively good\u201d again.  Like how the rest of the world looked at Sasuke as a heinous criminal during the war but Naruto just side-eyed him and said \u201cokay you\u2019re back let\u2019s team up\u201d You see Jiraiya conflicted about killing Orochimaru too - and in the end he did save the current Kage and revive the old ones. When Orochimaru offers himself to Katsuyu there\u2019s a scene where Tsunade looks at his face and she can tell his demeanor is different from before (though to be fair the last time she saw him he was trying to kill her and Shizune)",

He's talented enough to have outlived most of the Akatsuki after all. If I were Naruto after the war, I'd have Sasuke force Orochimaru to give up all of his knowledge with genjutsu, tell him he'll be acknowledged for his participation in the shinobi war, and have him executed to give the families of his victims some closure if they find out they were victimized by Orochimaru.",

I'm certain he'll just take it all in stride and eventually win everyone over and figure it out on his own... \"\n\n\nAlso I want to know who the hell took care of infant Naruto and when did they decide he was old enough to live on his own with zero supervision... I can understand the villagers being scared and hiruzen not wanting to confirm kurama was in Naruto but like damn man what? Was he fending for himself at like 2 days old?

A child with crayons? He just looked so jarring against all the backdrops and stuff. Not horrifying or anything at all.\n\nBasically I mystery science theatre 3000 Naruto and I'm done with the original series and I'm on like episode 100~ish but it's been a fun ride shitting on some of the cornier stuff like that whole fight. That was probably the lamest part of the series I've seen so far besides the 2 identical angry woman characters with different hair colors knocking each other out simultaneously, but that got me a good laugh at how bad they both sucked at the same time.\n\nDon't even get me started on how the new characters were so lame. Woodchuck and Dollar General Rorschach were some eye rolling stuff for me.\n\nSomehow I still like this children's show though. Anyway, rant over.",

Orochimaru was doing a lot of  human experiments while he was still in the village and it was sanctioned by Danzo when he was working him. If you remember one of the reasons he got chased out was that he had used war orphans - but they were from the same place Danzo was pulling kids for Root (which was how he found Kabuto in the first place).\n\nA part of that human research went towards harvesting Hashirama cells to make Danzos arm. Then there\u2019s also Yamato who was \u201creborn\u201d shortly following Orochimaru exit - but after a series of failed experiments (that must have started prior) with the same technology Danzo had him working on. \n\nI think this is more why Hiruzen acted the way he did - he couldn\u2019t fully blame Orochimaru for all his shit when he was still letting Danzo run free (who did literally everything Oro did and worse, including an assassination attempt)\n\nMy head cannon is Tsunade probably pushed for letting him off. She remembers him growing up so she\u2019d be more likely to believe he was \u201crelatively good\u201d again.  Like how the rest of the world looked at Sasuke as a heinous criminal during the war but Naruto just side-eyed him and said \u201cokay you\u2019re back let\u2019s team up\u201d You see Jiraiya conflicted about killing Orochimaru too - and in the end he did save the current Kage and revive the old ones. When Orochimaru offers himself to Katsuyu there\u2019s a scene where Tsunade looks at his face and she can tell his demeanor is different from before (though to be fair the last time she saw him he was trying to kill her and Shizune)",

A child with crayons? He just looked so jarring against all the backdrops and stuff. Not horrifying or anything at all.\n\nBasically I mystery science theatre 3000 Naruto and I'm done with the original series and I'm on like episode 100~ish but it's been a fun ride shitting on some of the cornier stuff like that whole fight. That was probably the lamest part of the series I've seen so far besides the 2 identical angry woman characters with different hair colors knocking each other out simultaneously, but that got me a good laugh at how bad they both sucked at the same time.\n\nDon't even get me started on how the new characters were so lame. Woodchuck and Dollar General Rorschach were some eye rolling stuff for me.\n\nSomehow I still like this children's show though. Anyway, rant over.",

I know he was supposed to be a \"monster\" or some shit and Shitkura was making a lot of anime noises before he domestically abused her, but all I could think was who the fuck drew this? A child with crayons? He just looked so jarring against all the backdrops and stuff. Not horrifying or anything at all.\n\nBasically I mystery science theatre 3000 Naruto and I'm done with the original series and I'm on like episode 100~ish but it's been a fun ride shitting on some of the cornier stuff like that whole fight. That was probably the lamest part of the series I've seen so far besides the 2 identical angry woman characters with different hair colors knocking each other out simultaneously, but that got me a good laugh at how bad they both sucked at the same time.\n\nDon't even get me started on how the new characters were so lame. Woodchuck and Dollar General Rorschach were some eye rolling stuff for me.\n\nSomehow I still like this children's show though. Anyway, rant over.",

Mengele was probably a known hero within the houses of proud Nazi's able to continue their lineage among the generations, of course Mengele knew his actions were wrong and continued anyway which shows a difference from the two. \n\n>Are you comparing a soldier killing in battle with someone making human experiments with children??\n\nIt was an example of how Opinions of people can change depending on how you're involved with them \n\n> I honestly hope that you're just trying to be edgy.\n\n\nBit cheeky insult it's fine \n\n>And without Von Braun, there's no man in the moon.
