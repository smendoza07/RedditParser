    "body": "I have no one to share this with in real life so I'll just post it here. I'm officially a sugar baby now, wow!\n\nBackstory: I've been curious about the sugar lifestyle for a couple years - previously joking about getting one, now I follow several sex workers and sugar babies on instagram and they've showed me both the positives and negatives of the lifestyle, so I felt well-prepared prior to diving into this. Also, I'm from a Northern-European country which doesnt really have a great sugaring market - I moved to the UK to study a couple years ago so I feel like it's time to finally take advantage of my location for that purpose. Also, I guess I'm partially writing this post to give hope to other girls out there that's a bit chubbier, I'm 5ft 5 and 11.8st/75kg. I personally thought all men searched for slim/curvy girls so I'm very happy that there was someone out there for me.\n\nNow, 3 weeks ago, I made a profile on SA. It was overwhelming and scary in the start but because of this forum (thank you guys!!) I've learnt what to filter for and see through the messages of which guys that appear scammy or salty. I was afraid of showing my face but found that using a public photo cropping out everything but my smile kept me 'hidden' but still relevant to SDs that prefer seeing their future SB's face. \n\nA week ago I messaged a 45yo man (I'm 21 for reference) and we ended up texting quite a bit - this guy was good at keeping a proper conversation! He's had a profile for a year but haven't used it since he made it (some girl stalked him and confronted him about being married and having kids, despite him disclosing that in his profile... it scared him so he didnt bother trying to find an arrangement - babies, stalk your POTs but do it quietly. When he told me about the stalker I pretended that I hadn't searched for him on Facebook lol). Very randomly he logged on over the weekend, and I looked through recently active profiles and decided to message him. And he loved that I messaged him first: (ladies, take notes!) I referred to something in his profile, introduced myself shortly, then finished off with a convo starter - so far that's been my most successful approach rather than \"hi there, (convo starter)\". \n\nWe agreed on doing a M&G and went to this bar. He bought drinks and we spent around 1.5h together rather than just 30 mins, which was lovely, I could feel that we got along well and that he's not a sketchy guy - he's separated and has 2 kids (oldest is 14), it was very apparent that he's a caring and loving person - hoping that he's like that in bed too, haha! ;) He kept complimenting me, and we actually kissed at the end. Crazily enough, this was both of our first M&Gs off of SA, and we clicked so well! \n\nHe's not from around my city but recently moved because of work, so I feel like I'm in charge of what we're doing and where we're going - I'm a student here (not from the UK) and want to be discreet because I know a lot of people, it's nice to be able to choose where we're going - and he's just happy I'm showing him around the city. We discussed when we were going to have our next meeting at the end of the M&G, and I suggested sushi - that's when I had to drop the \"I'm vegan\"-bomb, and he didn't react badly at all; in fact, he had been a veggie for years previously! Having dinner together won't be awkward at all, he might even be tempted to try the veggie options with me :D\n\nIt's been a bit awkward between us now just having that allowance-talk, going between different numbers.. I realised that my starting number was very very high (maybe not for richer SDs, but this is my first time sugaring so right now gaining SB experience itself is more important to me) - but after reading that someone suggested the ppm to not be below the weekly rent you'd pay for a nice 1 bedroom flat, we landed on a number that we're both happy with. Once the trust is there we're extending to allowance. We're meeting on thursday next week, going for sushi (veggie version, at least for me) :)\n\nThe only thing I'm worried about for the future is people I know seeing me with an older man, and going to a hotel/home with him in terms of safety-precautions; I'm sharing my location with friends and it would be a bit weird to ask them to check in on me hourly lol... anyone got tips for how I can have my friends check in on me without disclosing that I'm sugaring? \n\n\n\nEdit: If there's any other SBs in the UK I'd love to have someone to talk to and share things with! X\n\nEdit 2: He just messaged me saying he's fighting the urge to meet me before thursday next week..! Think I've got him hooked on me\n\nEdit 3: Aaand now we've scheduled a tapas date for monday, as well as the sushi for thursday. No sex yet, still he's agreed to give me (a reduced) PPM. Not trying to rinse him, just want the intimacy to come naturally and he's agreed with that because it's his first arrangement as well. \nAnyone interested in an update post next week? :)",

Very interesting to get an insight into their lives, particularly through their stories.
