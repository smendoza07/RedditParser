And conditioning?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am also trying to use less shampoo right now. In my entire life I washed my hair everyday with shampoo, because it was already oily the next day when I didn't use it (I have the same hair color as OP).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's already the sixth day right now where I only washed my hair with water. It's looking alright I guess, of course my hair doesn't look clean and I have a couple of dandruffs, but it's not as bad as I thought. And I don't need hairstyling products right now :D The oil in my hair is enough. I just need to comb it to the back and it holds in this position almost as good (not really) as hairstyling products.",

I used to think my hair was oily and that I ad dandruff then I went totally cold turkey doing the \"curly girl method\" and just condition every day. First week or two had some gross little clusters of sebum and dry skin I would pick off my scalp (disgusting, I know, sorry) but it just stopped to be honest, last time I shampooed my hair was over a month ago, it's a little wavier now, and I don't see any reason to ever go back.\n\nTry american crew forming cream for a good product for medium length hair that won't look greasy at all.\n\nBTW you have great hair. I thought it looked good in the first picture but I think I like the second picture better. I think you did yourself a favor with trimming the beard up. I'd say keep it at that length or even slightly shorter, and I'd be interested to see it if you let it creep up your cheeks a bit too.\n\nAwesome job!",

Seems like they are the only ones we're protecting at this point, and numbers shows that approximately 99% of the death cases of people tested positively to corona had an underlying health condition (source: Dutch research). The other 1% is guessed to be the people who had a higher exposure to the virus due to a lowered immune system (doctors, nurses, police etc)\n\nI'm all game for for staying home to protect people from a virus, but I do wanna see the target/affected group stay home instead of strolling down the city streets or public parks.",

And conditioning?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am also trying to use less shampoo right now. In my entire life I washed my hair everyday with shampoo, because it was already oily the next day when I didn't use it (I have the same hair color as OP).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's already the sixth day right now where I only washed my hair with water. It's looking alright I guess, of course my hair doesn't look clean and I have a couple of dandruffs, but it's not as bad as I thought. And I don't need hairstyling products right now :D The oil in my hair is enough. I just need to comb it to the back and it holds in this position almost as good (not really) as hairstyling products.",

I thought it looked good in the first picture but I think I like the second picture better. I think you did yourself a favor with trimming the beard up. I'd say keep it at that length or even slightly shorter, and I'd be interested to see it if you let it creep up your cheeks a bit too.\n\nAwesome job!",

And conditioning?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am also trying to use less shampoo right now. In my entire life I washed my hair everyday with shampoo, because it was already oily the next day when I didn't use it (I have the same hair color as OP).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's already the sixth day right now where I only washed my hair with water. It's looking alright I guess, of course my hair doesn't look clean and I have a couple of dandruffs, but it's not as bad as I thought. And I don't need hairstyling products right now :D The oil in my hair is enough. I just need to comb it to the back and it holds in this position almost as good (not really) as hairstyling products.",

I thought it looked good in the first picture but I think I like the second picture better. I think you did yourself a favor with trimming the beard up. I'd say keep it at that length or even slightly shorter, and I'd be interested to see it if you let it creep up your cheeks a bit too.\n\nAwesome job!",

I used to think my hair was oily and that I ad dandruff then I went totally cold turkey doing the \"curly girl method\" and just condition every day. First week or two had some gross little clusters of sebum and dry skin I would pick off my scalp (disgusting, I know, sorry) but it just stopped to be honest, last time I shampooed my hair was over a month ago, it's a little wavier now, and I don't see any reason to ever go back.\n\nTry american crew forming cream for a good product for medium length hair that won't look greasy at all.\n\nBTW you have great hair. I thought it looked good in the first picture but I think I like the second picture better. I think you did yourself a favor with trimming the beard up. I'd say keep it at that length or even slightly shorter, and I'd be interested to see it if you let it creep up your cheeks a bit too.\n\nAwesome job!",

What is your routine? Shampoo twice a week. And conditioning?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am also trying to use less shampoo right now. In my entire life I washed my hair everyday with shampoo, because it was already oily the next day when I didn't use it (I have the same hair color as OP).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's already the sixth day right now where I only washed my hair with water. It's looking alright I guess, of course my hair doesn't look clean and I have a couple of dandruffs, but it's not as bad as I thought. And I don't need hairstyling products right now :D The oil in my hair is enough. I just need to comb it to the back and it holds in this position almost as good (not really) as hairstyling products.",

I thought it looked good in the first picture but I think I like the second picture better. I think you did yourself a favor with trimming the beard up. I'd say keep it at that length or even slightly shorter, and I'd be interested to see it if you let it creep up your cheeks a bit too.\n\nAwesome job!",

Seems like they are the only ones we're protecting at this point, and numbers shows that approximately 99% of the death cases of people tested positively to corona had an underlying health condition (source: Dutch research). The other 1% is guessed to be the people who had a higher exposure to the virus due to a lowered immune system (doctors, nurses, police etc)\n\nI'm all game for for staying home to protect people from a virus, but I do wanna see the target/affected group stay home instead of strolling down the city streets or public parks.",
