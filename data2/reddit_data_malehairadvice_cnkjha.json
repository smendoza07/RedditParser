You could always pluck but if your eyebrows are similar to mine at all threading will be a much better option.

Just tell them you want your brows cleaned up a bit while still keeping your natural shape. It's cheap and totally worth it.",

You ask them for an eyebrow trim and they trim down the long hairs but they don't really clean it up. You need to find someone in your area that does eyebrow threading. Typically those types of people work in salons so you can try there but a Google search should be able to find someone that does threading in your area. Typically this is much more common for females but men still do it so don't feel weird if you have to go a salon. Just tell the person you want your brows cleaned up a bit. If you're a guy they'll take less off to keep the natural shape, that's important. It's cheap and effective.",

You ask them for an eyebrow trim and they trim down the long hairs but they don't really clean it up. You need to find someone in your area that does eyebrow threading. Typically those types of people work in salons so you can try there but a Google search should be able to find someone that does threading in your area. Typically this is much more common for females but men still do it so don't feel weird if you have to go a salon. Just tell the person you want your brows cleaned up a bit. If you're a guy they'll take less off to keep the natural shape, that's important. It's cheap and effective.",
