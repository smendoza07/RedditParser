This is Hiruzen at his absolute worst state and he manages to save the village anyway.",

I would've also loved a much more elaborate storyline with the SO6P, Indra and Ashura, I think there's tons of potential in their characters, environment etc, I quite liked the filler about Indra and Ashura (it had some problems but was overall pretty good). It would've also been really cool to see more of Shisui's upbringing and story (not the anime filler itachi arc). Why did he have mangekyo, who did he lose? His ancestor was Kagami who Tobirama said was one of the good Uchiha. How did Shisui develop his body flicker, etc etc. Even Minato and Jiraiya would've been really cool to delve into more thoroughly.   \n\n\nAlso I would've loved Naruto leading his own genin squad, that's what Shikamaru alluded to after Jiraiya had died and Shikamaru said it was time the students prepared for the next generation. I wouldve loved to see what the konoha 11 would be up to, who would lead a genin squad, who would become part of some special squad like Asuma was a Guardian Twelve, who would join the Anbu, what types of missions they'd go on etc!",

Same for Shikamaru vs Temari or Kakashi vs Zabuza. Where they had to lure their opponent, into a false sense of security, so they would let down their guard. None of that is in later naruto.\nNot to mention resource management. They just start having, as much charkra andcweapons, as the plot needed.

Minato is basically a glass canon, since his chakra reserves aren't as busted as the previous 3, and his speed is what gave him the edge against everyone else. \n\nAlso, Hiruzen did raise the Sanin as his student squad, so he gets some credit for that, even if they gained more feats from other sources. Its like how Kakashi clearly gets outranked by his students, but he's still seen as powerful because he was their teacher (and his own feats obviously)",

Even  Shippuden Naruto would not have had the capability to control that much chakra and transform it into a Jutsu without the help of Kuruma, and even the best they could do with it is an explosion. To make a construct of such large proportion with such fine control is unimaginable. The amount of chakra put into that mud wall was larger than the amount of chakra Pain used to destroy Konoha. \n\nThe quartz wall was a fictional technique from some book. It was fictional because no person could ever have the chakra precision to transform and earth style technique to be resistant to lightning without being able to see it, and react faster than the lightning strike hits to pin point the change in chakra and transform the part of the wall from earth to crystal and back faster than lightning can strike, at multiple places at the same time. Kakashi did it. \n\nThe fire bird technique is a fire Jutsu more powerful than the Majestic flame destroyer used by Madara. It basically spawns a fire so intense that it can instantly evaporate dozens of Jonin-level water techniques simultaneously, and that fire then takes the form of a massive bird, which Kakashi can use like an RC fighter jet.",

If Hiruzen was in his prime he would have stopped Orochimaru completely, but could he have stopped Kurama? If Minato never died the Leaf village would have halted a couple of invasions. Minato taking on Orochimaru during the Chunnin exams would have ended instantly i.e if we take in to account this is after the 9tails attack, he would have half of Kurama in him. I think each Hokage is unique and besides Tsunade, Danzo, Kakashi each can give each other a run for their money",

Kakashi\u2019s growth post Shippuden is so massive that he can slap the shit out of any part 1 character using a shadow clone honestly, and nobody is going to believe a statement that says Hirzuen is stronger than Hashirama",

Naruto, Madara, Juubito all have access to Yin-Yang release and This Kekkei Genkai is one of the reasons Hagoromo was so OP. And Hokage Kakashi has.... Regular ass Chakra and some new techniques in his arsenal soo.... What's your fucking point?\n\n\nYou all like to brag around that Prime Hiruzen is just Hypothetical and it isn't shown how powerful he is. Well, so is Hokage Kakashi. He has gotten stronger according to the light novels but were not told how strong.\n\nSo it's a bit tough for us to believe from such a vague statement that Kakashi made the jump from just below KCM2 Naruto to Fucking Hagoromo level.\n\n\nI'm sorry just raising large mud walls isn't enough to propell him up to the Higher level kages.\n\nMud walls? Well Hashirama summoned up a One thousands armed Wooden buddha statue that can easily destroy a susanoo armored Kyuubi.

He was hand picked and trained by Tobirama and Hashirama to become Hokage one day because they saw the genius and potential he had, he surpassed Tobirama at a young age and when he said that he was the strongest of them all so he would be the decoy nobody including Tobirama denied it, and Tobirama decided to make him the next Hokage. Only Danzo\u2019s jealous ass tried to argue. Hiruzen didn\u2019t have KKG, Senjutsu, or a tailed beast and he wasn\u2019t a Senju, Uzumaki or Otsutsuki yet he earned the title God of Shinobi and The Professor based off his power, skill and intellect. Only two others have had the God of Shinobi title.. Hagoromo and Hashirama. Hiruzen was just cursed with horrendous aging genes. In his prime he was a monster, though he was a compassionate one and that\u2019s why Danzo and Orochimaru got away with the bullshit they did. Now if only Konohamaru could have inherited his power and skill..",

I would've also loved a much more elaborate storyline with the SO6P, Indra and Ashura, I think there's tons of potential in their characters, environment etc, I quite liked the filler about Indra and Ashura (it had some problems but was overall pretty good). It would've also been really cool to see more of Shisui's upbringing and story (not the anime filler itachi arc). Why did he have mangekyo, who did he lose? His ancestor was Kagami who Tobirama said was one of the good Uchiha. How did Shisui develop his body flicker, etc etc. Even Minato and Jiraiya would've been really cool to delve into more thoroughly.   \n\n\nAlso I would've loved Naruto leading his own genin squad, that's what Shikamaru alluded to after Jiraiya had died and Shikamaru said it was time the students prepared for the next generation. I wouldve loved to see what the konoha 11 would be up to, who would lead a genin squad, who would become part of some special squad like Asuma was a Guardian Twelve, who would join the Anbu, what types of missions they'd go on etc!",

Hashirama has the best healing and overall power strength and chakra, but Tobirama had the biggest collection of Jutsus, since he created like 80% of the jutsus the village knows, Hiruzen, well we don't actually see or get told where his strength lies in, but it probably has to do with knowing all the jutsus and quick thinking and his summon, while Minato has the fastest reflexes, speed, and overall understanding of his fights, and then knowing some top tier sealing jutsus only helps. Minato is basically a glass canon, since his chakra reserves aren't as busted as the previous 3, and his speed is what gave him the edge against everyone else. \n\nAlso, Hiruzen did raise the Sanin as his student squad, so he gets some credit for that, even if they gained more feats from other sources. Its like how Kakashi clearly gets outranked by his students, but he's still seen as powerful because he was their teacher (and his own feats obviously)",

Even  Shippuden Naruto would not have had the capability to control that much chakra and transform it into a Jutsu without the help of Kuruma, and even the best they could do with it is an explosion. To make a construct of such large proportion with such fine control is unimaginable. The amount of chakra put into that mud wall was larger than the amount of chakra Pain used to destroy Konoha. \n\nThe quartz wall was a fictional technique from some book. It was fictional because no person could ever have the chakra precision to transform and earth style technique to be resistant to lightning without being able to see it, and react faster than the lightning strike hits to pin point the change in chakra and transform the part of the wall from earth to crystal and back faster than lightning can strike, at multiple places at the same time. Kakashi did it. \n\nThe fire bird technique is a fire Jutsu more powerful than the Majestic flame destroyer used by Madara. It basically spawns a fire so intense that it can instantly evaporate dozens of Jonin-level water techniques simultaneously, and that fire then takes the form of a massive bird, which Kakashi can use like an RC fighter jet.",

FYI Shikamaru and Choji have Ying and Yang respectively, having both together is the impressive part.\n\nU probably didn\u2019t think through the Quartz or mud wall feats.

Do some basic calculation, you should understand how much chakra he has. Not as much as Hashirama but much much more than Hiruzen. \n\nHad you read the novels, it gives a very good impression of exactly how strong he\u2019s gotten.

I would've also loved a much more elaborate storyline with the SO6P, Indra and Ashura, I think there's tons of potential in their characters, environment etc, I quite liked the filler about Indra and Ashura (it had some problems but was overall pretty good). It would've also been really cool to see more of Shisui's upbringing and story (not the anime filler itachi arc). Why did he have mangekyo, who did he lose? His ancestor was Kagami who Tobirama said was one of the good Uchiha. How did Shisui develop his body flicker, etc etc. Even Minato and Jiraiya would've been really cool to delve into more thoroughly.   \n\n\nAlso I would've loved Naruto leading his own genin squad, that's what Shikamaru alluded to after Jiraiya had died and Shikamaru said it was time the students prepared for the next generation. I wouldve loved to see what the konoha 11 would be up to, who would lead a genin squad, who would become part of some special squad like Asuma was a Guardian Twelve, who would join the Anbu, what types of missions they'd go on etc!",

Same for Shikamaru vs Temari or Kakashi vs Zabuza. Where they had to lure their opponent, into a false sense of security, so they would let down their guard. None of that is in later naruto.\nNot to mention resource management. They just start having, as much charkra andcweapons, as the plot needed.

Hashirama has the best healing and overall power strength and chakra, but Tobirama had the biggest collection of Jutsus, since he created like 80% of the jutsus the village knows, Hiruzen, well we don't actually see or get told where his strength lies in, but it probably has to do with knowing all the jutsus and quick thinking and his summon, while Minato has the fastest reflexes, speed, and overall understanding of his fights, and then knowing some top tier sealing jutsus only helps. Minato is basically a glass canon, since his chakra reserves aren't as busted as the previous 3, and his speed is what gave him the edge against everyone else. \n\nAlso, Hiruzen did raise the Sanin as his student squad, so he gets some credit for that, even if they gained more feats from other sources. Its like how Kakashi clearly gets outranked by his students, but he's still seen as powerful because he was their teacher (and his own feats obviously)",

Even  Shippuden Naruto would not have had the capability to control that much chakra and transform it into a Jutsu without the help of Kuruma, and even the best they could do with it is an explosion. To make a construct of such large proportion with such fine control is unimaginable. The amount of chakra put into that mud wall was larger than the amount of chakra Pain used to destroy Konoha. \n\nThe quartz wall was a fictional technique from some book. It was fictional because no person could ever have the chakra precision to transform and earth style technique to be resistant to lightning without being able to see it, and react faster than the lightning strike hits to pin point the change in chakra and transform the part of the wall from earth to crystal and back faster than lightning can strike, at multiple places at the same time. Kakashi did it. \n\nThe fire bird technique is a fire Jutsu more powerful than the Majestic flame destroyer used by Madara. It basically spawns a fire so intense that it can instantly evaporate dozens of Jonin-level water techniques simultaneously, and that fire then takes the form of a massive bird, which Kakashi can use like an RC fighter jet.",

Regular ass Chakra and some new techniques in his arsenal soo.... What's your fucking point?\n\n\nYou all like to brag around that Prime Hiruzen is just Hypothetical and it isn't shown how powerful he is. Well, so is Hokage Kakashi. He has gotten stronger according to the light novels but were not told how strong.\n\nSo it's a bit tough for us to believe from such a vague statement that Kakashi made the jump from just below KCM2 Naruto to Fucking Hagoromo level.\n\n\nI'm sorry just raising large mud walls isn't enough to propell him up to the Higher level kages.\n\nMud walls? Well Hashirama summoned up a One thousands armed Wooden buddha statue that can easily destroy a susanoo armored Kyuubi.

It was not the senjus' to lord themselves over the uchiha and not for tobirama to impose his racist beliefs over them.\n\nMadara left after he realised what would happen to the uchiha. How tobirama would become hokage after Hashirama and that the Uchihas would always be under them.

If anyone was racist to the Uchihas, it was Danzo. \n\nAnd Madara didn't just leave, he literally betrayed the village, fought Hashirama then plotted the rest of his life against Konoha. He didn't give two shits and the other Uchiha he hired was creating the same mess over a girl.

It would've also been really cool to see more of Shisui's upbringing and story (not the anime filler itachi arc). Why did he have mangekyo, who did he lose? His ancestor was Kagami who Tobirama said was one of the good Uchiha. How did Shisui develop his body flicker, etc etc. Even Minato and Jiraiya would've been really cool to delve into more thoroughly.   \n\n\nAlso I would've loved Naruto leading his own genin squad, that's what Shikamaru alluded to after Jiraiya had died and Shikamaru said it was time the students prepared for the next generation. I wouldve loved to see what the konoha 11 would be up to, who would lead a genin squad, who would become part of some special squad like Asuma was a Guardian Twelve, who would join the Anbu, what types of missions they'd go on etc!",

Same for Shikamaru vs Temari or Kakashi vs Zabuza. Where they had to lure their opponent, into a false sense of security, so they would let down their guard. None of that is in later naruto.\nNot to mention resource management. They just start having, as much charkra andcweapons, as the plot needed.

Minato is basically a glass canon, since his chakra reserves aren't as busted as the previous 3, and his speed is what gave him the edge against everyone else. \n\nAlso, Hiruzen did raise the Sanin as his student squad, so he gets some credit for that, even if they gained more feats from other sources. Its like how Kakashi clearly gets outranked by his students, but he's still seen as powerful because he was their teacher (and his own feats obviously)",

Even  Shippuden Naruto would not have had the capability to control that much chakra and transform it into a Jutsu without the help of Kuruma, and even the best they could do with it is an explosion. To make a construct of such large proportion with such fine control is unimaginable. The amount of chakra put into that mud wall was larger than the amount of chakra Pain used to destroy Konoha. \n\nThe quartz wall was a fictional technique from some book. It was fictional because no person could ever have the chakra precision to transform and earth style technique to be resistant to lightning without being able to see it, and react faster than the lightning strike hits to pin point the change in chakra and transform the part of the wall from earth to crystal and back faster than lightning can strike, at multiple places at the same time. Kakashi did it. \n\nThe fire bird technique is a fire Jutsu more powerful than the Majestic flame destroyer used by Madara. It basically spawns a fire so intense that it can instantly evaporate dozens of Jonin-level water techniques simultaneously, and that fire then takes the form of a massive bird, which Kakashi can use like an RC fighter jet.",

What's your fucking point?\n\n\nYou all like to brag around that Prime Hiruzen is just Hypothetical and it isn't shown how powerful he is. Well, so is Hokage Kakashi. He has gotten stronger according to the light novels but were not told how strong.\n\nSo it's a bit tough for us to believe from such a vague statement that Kakashi made the jump from just below KCM2 Naruto to Fucking Hagoromo level.\n\n\nI'm sorry just raising large mud walls isn't enough to propell him up to the Higher level kages.\n\nMud walls? Well Hashirama summoned up a One thousands armed Wooden buddha statue that can easily destroy a susanoo armored Kyuubi.

It would've also been really cool to see more of Shisui's upbringing and story (not the anime filler itachi arc). Why did he have mangekyo, who did he lose? His ancestor was Kagami who Tobirama said was one of the good Uchiha. How did Shisui develop his body flicker, etc etc. Even Minato and Jiraiya would've been really cool to delve into more thoroughly.   \n\n\nAlso I would've loved Naruto leading his own genin squad, that's what Shikamaru alluded to after Jiraiya had died and Shikamaru said it was time the students prepared for the next generation. I wouldve loved to see what the konoha 11 would be up to, who would lead a genin squad, who would become part of some special squad like Asuma was a Guardian Twelve, who would join the Anbu, what types of missions they'd go on etc!",

No attempt at any strategy, beside that.\nSame for most of those other fight.

Same for Shikamaru vs Temari or Kakashi vs Zabuza. Where they had to lure their opponent, into a false sense of security, so they would let down their guard. None of that is in later naruto.\nNot to mention resource management. They just start having, as much charkra andcweapons, as the plot needed. Like how Kakashi used to be bedridden for days, after just using sharigan in a single fight, to him using it almost nonstop during the war-arc.",

Minato is basically a glass canon, since his chakra reserves aren't as busted as the previous 3, and his speed is what gave him the edge against everyone else. \n\nAlso, Hiruzen did raise the Sanin as his student squad, so he gets some credit for that, even if they gained more feats from other sources. Its like how Kakashi clearly gets outranked by his students, but he's still seen as powerful because he was their teacher (and his own feats obviously)",

Even  Shippuden Naruto would not have had the capability to control that much chakra and transform it into a Jutsu without the help of Kuruma, and even the best they could do with it is an explosion. To make a construct of such large proportion with such fine control is unimaginable. The amount of chakra put into that mud wall was larger than the amount of chakra Pain used to destroy Konoha. \n\nThe quartz wall was a fictional technique from some book. It was fictional because no person could ever have the chakra precision to transform and earth style technique to be resistant to lightning without being able to see it, and react faster than the lightning strike hits to pin point the change in chakra and transform the part of the wall from earth to crystal and back faster than lightning can strike, at multiple places at the same time. Kakashi did it. \n\nThe fire bird technique is a fire Jutsu more powerful than the Majestic flame destroyer used by Madara. It basically spawns a fire so intense that it can instantly evaporate dozens of Jonin-level water techniques simultaneously, and that fire then takes the form of a massive bird, which Kakashi can use like an RC fighter jet.",

Regular ass Chakra and some new techniques in his arsenal soo....

He has gotten stronger according to the light novels but were not told how strong.\n\nSo it's a bit tough for us to believe from such a vague statement that Kakashi made the jump from just below KCM2 Naruto to Fucking Hagoromo level.\n\n\nI'm sorry just raising large mud walls isn't enough to propell him up to the Higher level kages.\n\nMud walls? Well Hashirama summoned up a One thousands armed Wooden buddha statue that can easily destroy a susanoo armored Kyuubi.

Same for Shikamaru vs Temari or Kakashi vs Zabuza. Where they had to lure their opponent, into a false sense of security, so they would let down their guard. None of that is in later naruto.\nNot to mention resource management. They just start having, as much charkra andcweapons, as the plot needed. Like how Kakashi used to be bedridden for days, after just using sharigan in a single fight, to him using it almost nonstop during the war-arc.",

Minato is basically a glass canon, since his chakra reserves aren't as busted as the previous 3, and his speed is what gave him the edge against everyone else. \n\nAlso, Hiruzen did raise the Sanin as his student squad, so he gets some credit for that, even if they gained more feats from other sources. Its like how Kakashi clearly gets outranked by his students, but he's still seen as powerful because he was their teacher (and his own feats obviously)",

To make a construct of such large proportion with such fine control is unimaginable. The amount of chakra put into that mud wall was larger than the amount of chakra Pain used to destroy Konoha. \n\nThe quartz wall was a fictional technique from some book. It was fictional because no person could ever have the chakra precision to transform and earth style technique to be resistant to lightning without being able to see it, and react faster than the lightning strike hits to pin point the change in chakra and transform the part of the wall from earth to crystal and back faster than lightning can strike, at multiple places at the same time. Kakashi did it. \n\nThe fire bird technique is a fire Jutsu more powerful than the Majestic flame destroyer used by Madara. It basically spawns a fire so intense that it can instantly evaporate dozens of Jonin-level water techniques simultaneously, and that fire then takes the form of a massive bird, which Kakashi can use like an RC fighter jet.",

Well Hashirama summoned up a One thousands armed Wooden buddha statue that can easily destroy a susanoo armored Kyuubi.

Minato is basically a glass canon, since his chakra reserves aren't as busted as the previous 3, and his speed is what gave him the edge against everyone else. \n\nAlso, Hiruzen did raise the Sanin as his student squad, so he gets some credit for that, even if they gained more feats from other sources. Its like how Kakashi clearly gets outranked by his students, but he's still seen as powerful because he was their teacher (and his own feats obviously)",

To make a construct of such large proportion with such fine control is unimaginable. The amount of chakra put into that mud wall was larger than the amount of chakra Pain used to destroy Konoha. \n\nThe quartz wall was a fictional technique from some book. It was fictional because no person could ever have the chakra precision to transform and earth style technique to be resistant to lightning without being able to see it, and react faster than the lightning strike hits to pin point the change in chakra and transform the part of the wall from earth to crystal and back faster than lightning can strike, at multiple places at the same time. Kakashi did it. \n\nThe fire bird technique is a fire Jutsu more powerful than the Majestic flame destroyer used by Madara. It basically spawns a fire so intense that it can instantly evaporate dozens of Jonin-level water techniques simultaneously, and that fire then takes the form of a massive bird, which Kakashi can use like an RC fighter jet.",

Even  Shippuden Naruto would not have had the capability to control that much chakra and transform it into a Jutsu without the help of Kuruma, and even the best they could do with it is an explosion. To make a construct of such large proportion with such fine control is unimaginable. The amount of chakra put into that mud wall was larger than the amount of chakra Pain used to destroy Konoha. \n\nThe quartz wall was a fictional technique from some book. It was fictional because no person could ever have the chakra precision to transform and earth style technique to be resistant to lightning without being able to see it, and react faster than the lightning strike hits to pin point the change in chakra and transform the part of the wall from earth to crystal and back faster than lightning can strike, at multiple places at the same time. Kakashi did it. \n\nThe fire bird technique is a fire Jutsu more powerful than the Majestic flame destroyer used by Madara. It basically spawns a fire so intense that it can instantly evaporate dozens of Jonin-level water techniques simultaneously, and that fire then takes the form of a massive bird, which Kakashi can use like an RC fighter jet.",

To make a construct of such large proportion with such fine control is unimaginable. The amount of chakra put into that mud wall was larger than the amount of chakra Pain used to destroy Konoha. \n\nThe quartz wall was a fictional technique from some book. It was fictional because no person could ever have the chakra precision to transform and earth style technique to be resistant to lightning without being able to see it, and react faster than the lightning strike hits to pin point the change in chakra and transform the part of the wall from earth to crystal and back faster than lightning can strike, at multiple places at the same time. Kakashi did it. \n\nThe fire bird technique is a fire Jutsu more powerful than the Majestic flame destroyer used by Madara. It basically spawns a fire so intense that it can instantly evaporate dozens of Jonin-level water techniques simultaneously, and that fire then takes the form of a massive bird, which Kakashi can use like an RC fighter jet.",

Naruto, Madara, Juubito all have access to Yin-Yang release and This Kekkei Genkai is one of the reasons Hagoromo was so OP. And Hokage Kakashi has.... Regular ass Chakra and some new techniques in his arsenal soo.... What's your fucking point?\n\n\nYou all like to brag around that Prime Hiruzen is just Hypothetical and it isn't shown how powerful he is. Well, so is Hokage Kakashi. He has gotten stronger according to the light novels but were not told how strong.\n\nSo it's a bit tough for us to believe from such a vague statement that Kakashi made the jump from just below KCM2 Naruto to Fucking Hagoromo level.\n\n\nI'm sorry just raising large mud walls isn't enough to propell him up to the Higher level kages.\n\nMud walls? Well Hashirama summoned up a One thousands armed Wooden buddha statue that can easily destroy a susanoo armored Kyuubi. So i guess that makes Hashirama SSJ Goku level right?\ud83d\ude11 come on man.....",

Even  Shippuden Naruto would not have had the capability to control that much chakra and transform it into a Jutsu without the help of Kuruma, and even the best they could do with it is an explosion. To make a construct of such large proportion with such fine control is unimaginable. The amount of chakra put into that mud wall was larger than the amount of chakra Pain used to destroy Konoha. \n\nThe quartz wall was a fictional technique from some book. It was fictional because no person could ever have the chakra precision to transform and earth style technique to be resistant to lightning without being able to see it, and react faster than the lightning strike hits to pin point the change in chakra and transform the part of the wall from earth to crystal and back faster than lightning can strike, at multiple places at the same time. Kakashi did it. \n\nThe fire bird technique is a fire Jutsu more powerful than the Majestic flame destroyer used by Madara. It basically spawns a fire so intense that it can instantly evaporate dozens of Jonin-level water techniques simultaneously, and that fire then takes the form of a massive bird, which Kakashi can use like an RC fighter jet.",

Even  Shippuden Naruto would not have had the capability to control that much chakra and transform it into a Jutsu without the help of Kuruma, and even the best they could do with it is an explosion. To make a construct of such large proportion with such fine control is unimaginable. The amount of chakra put into that mud wall was larger than the amount of chakra Pain used to destroy Konoha. \n\nThe quartz wall was a fictional technique from some book. It was fictional because no person could ever have the chakra precision to transform and earth style technique to be resistant to lightning without being able to see it, and react faster than the lightning strike hits to pin point the change in chakra and transform the part of the wall from earth to crystal and back faster than lightning can strike, at multiple places at the same time. Kakashi did it. \n\nThe fire bird technique is a fire Jutsu more powerful than the Majestic flame destroyer used by Madara. It basically spawns a fire so intense that it can instantly evaporate dozens of Jonin-level water techniques simultaneously, and that fire then takes the form of a massive bird, which Kakashi can use like an RC fighter jet.",

Only accessible with people who have Otsutsuki blood and Six paths powers. I never expected you to bring in Shikamaru and Fucking Choji on the topic of Yin-Yang release\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nAlso, from the insanely long threads I've commented, which one of them aren't actual facts from canon?\n\n>Stop basing your arguments on opinions and start using canon feats instead\n\nYou say this and then go on to say shit like kAkAsHi HaS yIn YaNg rElEaSe.\n\nBraavo dude, I really had a great time listening to your stupidity.",
