    "body": "I had someone who apparently reads this sub reach out to me in a DM wanting to know if I\u2019m searching for an SR. They said they live close and were interested in learning more.\n\nI took a look at their post and comment history to understand their background and (thankfully!!) happened across one comment from eight months ago where she mentions that **she is only 15 years old**! I can only guess that she would have claimed to be 18.\n\nI responded and let her know I wasn\u2019t interested and that she should stay far away from any adult who would be.\n\nEdit: My actual response\u2026 \u201c*Sorry ######. You are far too young. You said in a comment about 8 months ago that you are only 15 years old. You are legally a child and must stay far away from any adult who would consider having a romantic relationship with you or who would condone it at all. Sex with someone underage is a serious crime and would literally end normal life for the adult.*\u201d",

But she contacted me, I met her, we sat and talked in my car. She tricked me out of a bit of money, which I saw coming, but it's a quick way to test someone. No intimacy, failed the test, fine.\n\nThen last month I saw on the news that she had been charged with a bunch of counts of carjacking and robbery. She would meet guys online, sit in their cars, then her friend would show up with a gun and rob them. So I dodged that literal bullet. But the other thing that concerned me was that she was actually 18, not 25, when they published her age. So another bullet dodged, I would never want to date an 18 year old.",

So your research on them, as I've been with SBs who are now in their mid twenties and admit to starting around 16 or 17 yrs old. Probably groomed by some pedo. As you get closer to 30yrs old, young women come clean on alot of things. They are attracted  to the easy money for sure. Some are trafficked by unsavory types. Fortunately,  when I M&G with those around 25, I ask straight up for a drivers license and facebook friendship. If they agree and prove their age, then we continue. If they can't prove their age, run don't walk away. These young ones are not mature enough to handle the game and they come with a whole bunch of unnecessary issues. The floor should be 25 yrs old.",

People say 18 is the minimum age of consent and thus define an 18 year old as an adult based on law but then you have states where the minimum age of consent is 16 or other countries where it\u2019s 14 and no one in their right mind would view them as adults in today\u2019s time. If we\u2019re talking about facts then we should also consider that the prefrontal cortex is not matured until 25. Again this discussion is probably not appropriate for this thread or maybe even this sub so I\u2019m just gonna stop right here.",

You\u2019ll need a photo copy of at least one form of her identification, 2 ideally.\n\n2. You\u2019ll need to have access to view all of her social media accounts. Her friends ages can be be a first clue, and most girls will reveal their true age on social media platforms, whether they mean to or not. For instance, a birthday party, with the balloons that reveal how old she is (super common now on IG).\n\n3. You\u2019ll want a short video recording of the two of you detailing what IS, and what it ISN\u2019T, apart of your sugar relationship. Included in this, she\u2019ll need to give her name and age. Also in the recording, have her sign the document I describe below, as witness to her signature.\n\n4. You\u2019ll want to have her sign a non disclosure agreement, as well as a legal document fully detailing the relationship. These documents will contain her age, and her signature, will be her confirming the accuracy of it.\n\nWe live in an age that any woman can point a finger at a man and claim he X,Y, or Z. You\u2019ll then spend the better part of the next decade trying to clear your name, if you ever even can.\n\nHaving the documents above in hand will give you a leg to stand on. Without them, your SOL, because it\u2019s her word against yours, and that doesn\u2019t bode well for a man in today\u2019s climate. \n\nWith OP\u2019s example of an underage girl, the difference can be 15 years behind bars, or a slap on the wrist with community service. Depends entirely on whether you have a credible defense or not.\n\nAs a high net worth individual, you\u2019re a target, plain and simple!\n\nBefore engaging in the bowl, you really need to seek out legal counsel. What it\u2019ll cost you is nothing, compared to the alternative of not having proper protection, if the situation ever comes up.",

As a result, I\u2019ve become intimately familiar with these types of cases.\n\nI also said, that I sought out a DIFFERENT law firm to draft my premeditated legal defense, regarding my extracurricular Sagaring activities.\n\n\u2014 For the love of GOD, again, I\u2019ve never even remotely suggested that. \n\nMy legal defense is a premeditated line of defense against a slew of problems that anyone sugaring could encounter in this lifestyle. \n\nOP mentioned, to be careful of underage girls potentially lying about their age, and my response has been about how to protect yourself if you ever found yourself in that situation\u2026 Nothing more, and nothing less!!!\n\nI HAVE NOT EVER GIVEN ADVICE ON HOW TO GET AWAY WITH RAPING A TEENAGER!!!!

How was I to know it was wrong to fuck a girl who looks like she's 16? She told me she was 18!!\"\n\"Look! I have documents she signed saying she was old enough for me to fuck her when I give her X money a month\"\n\n\nNot gonna go great for you bud. But I do think you might be able to convince a courtroom that an average 16yo is more intelligent and clever than you.",

I don\u2019t care what two consenting adults do, but it\u2019s ridiculous to think that a fresh out of high school 18 year old is on the same playing field as a grown 50 year old, and it\u2019s dangerous to pretend to ignore the manipulation that is frequently encountered in these relationships because it\u2019s between two \u201cconsenting adults\u201d. But this is not the thread for that nor do I (and I cannot stress this enough) care to debate this with you. I\u2019m fully aware of the legal age. It\u2019s not some elusive fact known only to a few.\n\nEdit: In the U.S. 34 states have 16 as the age of consent. This is why when people use legality as an excuse like it\u2019s set in stone, I have to roll my eyes. You cannot tell me a 16 year old is a fully functioning adult even though legally some states have set that as an age of consent. I mean some countries have it set to 14 so maybe legality shouldn\u2019t be used as a barometer of what is acceptable.",

You cannot tell me a 16 year old is a fully functioning adult even though legally some states have set that as an age of consent. I mean some countries have it set to 14 so maybe legality shouldn\u2019t be used as a barometer of what is acceptable.",

I\u2019m talking about sex between teenagers and adults and the minimum age of consent. I just find it funny when people hide behind the law like it\u2019s some shield. People say 18 is the minimum age of consent and thus define an 18 year old as an adult based on law but then you have states where the minimum age of consent is 16 or other countries where it\u2019s 14 and no one in their right mind would view them as adults in today\u2019s time. If we\u2019re talking about facts then we should also consider that the prefrontal cortex is not matured until 25. Again this discussion is probably not appropriate for this thread or maybe even this sub so I\u2019m just gonna stop right here.",

As a result, I\u2019ve become intimately familiar with these types of cases.\n\nI also said, that I sought out a DIFFERENT law firm to draft my premeditated legal defense, regarding my extracurricular Sagaring activities.\n\n\u2014 For the love of GOD, again, I\u2019ve never even remotely suggested that. \n\nMy legal defense is a premeditated line of defense against a slew of problems that anyone sugaring could encounter in this lifestyle. \n\nOP mentioned, to be careful of underage girls potentially lying about their age, and my response has been about how to protect yourself if you ever found yourself in that situation\u2026 Nothing more, and nothing less!!!\n\nI HAVE NOT EVER GIVEN ADVICE ON HOW TO GET AWAY WITH RAPING A TEENAGER!!!!

When you're the one engaging in the biggest fantasy role play here? \n\nNo contract or document is gonna save your ass when you have sex with an underage girl. Oh, she lied about her age? Oh yes. That 16yo is so intelligent she managed to outwit this significantly older man, a brilliant mind by his own account.\n\n\nLiterally your legal plan/defense for yourself is \"your honor, this child lied to me! How was I to know it was wrong to fuck a girl who looks like she's 16? She told me she was 18!!\"\n\"Look! I have documents she signed saying she was old enough for me to fuck her when I give her X money a month\"\n\n\nNot gonna go great for you bud.

I don\u2019t care what two consenting adults do, but it\u2019s ridiculous to think that a fresh out of high school 18 year old is on the same playing field as a grown 50 year old, and it\u2019s dangerous to pretend to ignore the manipulation that is frequently encountered in these relationships because it\u2019s between two \u201cconsenting adults\u201d. But this is not the thread for that nor do I (and I cannot stress this enough) care to debate this with you. I\u2019m fully aware of the legal age. It\u2019s not some elusive fact known only to a few.\n\nEdit: In the U.S. 34 states have 16 as the age of consent. This is why when people use legality as an excuse like it\u2019s set in stone, I have to roll my eyes. You cannot tell me a 16 year old is a fully functioning adult even though legally some states have set that as an age of consent. I mean some countries have it set to 14 so maybe legality shouldn\u2019t be used as a barometer of what is acceptable.",

Smaller amounts would probably not attract attorneys unless the spouse was especially vindictive.",

I\u2019m talking about sex between teenagers and adults and the minimum age of consent. I just find it funny when people hide behind the law like it\u2019s some shield. People say 18 is the minimum age of consent and thus define an 18 year old as an adult based on law but then you have states where the minimum age of consent is 16 or other countries where it\u2019s 14 and no one in their right mind would view them as adults in today\u2019s time. If we\u2019re talking about facts then we should also consider that the prefrontal cortex is not matured until 25. Again this discussion is probably not appropriate for this thread or maybe even this sub so I\u2019m just gonna stop right here.",

I said my company has a legal department that deals with \u201cstrict liability\u201d cases daily, and in large numbers. So It shouldn\u2019t come ad a surprise to you, that as owner, and CEO of the company, that over the course of several decades of dealing with these cases I\u2019ve consulted my legal department a da*n near indefinite amount of times. As a result, I\u2019ve become intimately familiar with these types of cases.\n\nI also said, that I sought out a DIFFERENT law firm to draft my premeditated legal defense, regarding my extracurricular Sagaring activities.\n\n\u2014 For the love of GOD, again, I\u2019ve never even remotely suggested that. \n\nMy legal defense is a premeditated line of defense against a slew of problems that anyone sugaring could encounter in this lifestyle. \n\nOP mentioned, to be careful of underage girls potentially lying about their age, and my response has been about how to protect yourself if you ever found yourself in that situation\u2026 Nothing more, and nothing less!!!\n\nI HAVE NOT EVER GIVEN ADVICE ON HOW TO GET AWAY WITH RAPING A TEENAGER!!!!

But regardless, your proposal is not rooted in reality and won\u2019t be accepted by a good majority of SBs because it\u2019s a complete invasion of privacy not to mention that most SD\u2019s don\u2019t even have the patience for multiple platonic dates, but they will for something as involved as your idea? \n\nListen, unwad that pretty panty of yours; I\u2019m not being a nosy prude. I don\u2019t care what two consenting adults do, but it\u2019s ridiculous to think that a fresh out of high school 18 year old is on the same playing field as a grown 50 year old, and it\u2019s dangerous to pretend to ignore the manipulation that is frequently encountered in these relationships because it\u2019s between two \u201cconsenting adults\u201d. But this is not the thread for that nor do I (and I cannot stress this enough) care to debate this with you. I\u2019m fully aware of the legal age. It\u2019s not some elusive fact known only to a few.\n\nEdit: In the U.S. 34 states have 16 as the age of consent. This is why when people use legality as an excuse like it\u2019s set in stone, I have to roll my eyes. You cannot tell me a 16 year old is a fully functioning adult even though legally some states have set that as an age of consent. I mean some countries have it set to 14 so maybe legality shouldn\u2019t be used as a barometer of what is acceptable.",

I\u2019m talking about sex between teenagers and adults and the minimum age of consent. I just find it funny when people hide behind the law like it\u2019s some shield. People say 18 is the minimum age of consent and thus define an 18 year old as an adult based on law but then you have states where the minimum age of consent is 16 or other countries where it\u2019s 14 and no one in their right mind would view them as adults in today\u2019s time. If we\u2019re talking about facts then we should also consider that the prefrontal cortex is not matured until 25. Again this discussion is probably not appropriate for this thread or maybe even this sub so I\u2019m just gonna stop right here.",

It alludes your understanding apparently\n\n\u2014 I\u2019m not abusing my power as a CEO. You\u2019re implying something more than what I said. I said my company has a legal department that deals with \u201cstrict liability\u201d cases daily, and in large numbers. So It shouldn\u2019t come ad a surprise to you, that as owner, and CEO of the company, that over the course of several decades of dealing with these cases I\u2019ve consulted my legal department a da*n near indefinite amount of times. As a result, I\u2019ve become intimately familiar with these types of cases.\n\nI also said, that I sought out a DIFFERENT law firm to draft my premeditated legal defense, regarding my extracurricular Sagaring activities.\n\n\u2014 For the love of GOD, again, I\u2019ve never even remotely suggested that. \n\nMy legal defense is a premeditated line of defense against a slew of problems that anyone sugaring could encounter in this lifestyle. \n\nOP mentioned, to be careful of underage girls potentially lying about their age, and my response has been about how to protect yourself if you ever found yourself in that situation\u2026 Nothing more, and nothing less!!!\n\nI HAVE NOT EVER GIVEN ADVICE ON HOW TO GET AWAY WITH RAPING A TEENAGER!!!!

But regardless, your proposal is not rooted in reality and won\u2019t be accepted by a good majority of SBs because it\u2019s a complete invasion of privacy not to mention that most SD\u2019s don\u2019t even have the patience for multiple platonic dates, but they will for something as involved as your idea? \n\nListen, unwad that pretty panty of yours; I\u2019m not being a nosy prude. I don\u2019t care what two consenting adults do, but it\u2019s ridiculous to think that a fresh out of high school 18 year old is on the same playing field as a grown 50 year old, and it\u2019s dangerous to pretend to ignore the manipulation that is frequently encountered in these relationships because it\u2019s between two \u201cconsenting adults\u201d. But this is not the thread for that nor do I (and I cannot stress this enough) care to debate this with you. I\u2019m fully aware of the legal age. It\u2019s not some elusive fact known only to a few.\n\nEdit: In the U.S. 34 states have 16 as the age of consent. This is why when people use legality as an excuse like it\u2019s set in stone, I have to roll my eyes. You cannot tell me a 16 year old is a fully functioning adult even though legally some states have set that as an age of consent. I mean some countries have it set to 14 so maybe legality shouldn\u2019t be used as a barometer of what is acceptable.",

People say 18 is the minimum age of consent and thus define an 18 year old as an adult based on law but then you have states where the minimum age of consent is 16 or other countries where it\u2019s 14 and no one in their right mind would view them as adults in today\u2019s time. If we\u2019re talking about facts then we should also consider that the prefrontal cortex is not matured until 25.

It alludes your understanding apparently\n\n\u2014 I\u2019m not abusing my power as a CEO. You\u2019re implying something more than what I said. I said my company has a legal department that deals with \u201cstrict liability\u201d cases daily, and in large numbers. So It shouldn\u2019t come ad a surprise to you, that as owner, and CEO of the company, that over the course of several decades of dealing with these cases I\u2019ve consulted my legal department a da*n near indefinite amount of times. As a result, I\u2019ve become intimately familiar with these types of cases.\n\nI also said, that I sought out a DIFFERENT law firm to draft my premeditated legal defense, regarding my extracurricular Sagaring activities.\n\n\u2014 For the love of GOD, again, I\u2019ve never even remotely suggested that. \n\nMy legal defense is a premeditated line of defense against a slew of problems that anyone sugaring could encounter in this lifestyle. \n\nOP mentioned, to be careful of underage girls potentially lying about their age, and my response has been about how to protect yourself if you ever found yourself in that situation\u2026 Nothing more, and nothing less!!!\n\nI HAVE NOT EVER GIVEN ADVICE ON HOW TO GET AWAY WITH RAPING A TEENAGER!!!!

I don\u2019t care what two consenting adults do, but it\u2019s ridiculous to think that a fresh out of high school 18 year old is on the same playing field as a grown 50 year old, and it\u2019s dangerous to pretend to ignore the manipulation that is frequently encountered in these relationships because it\u2019s between two \u201cconsenting adults\u201d. But this is not the thread for that nor do I (and I cannot stress this enough) care to debate this with you. I\u2019m fully aware of the legal age. It\u2019s not some elusive fact known only to a few.\n\nEdit: In the U.S. 34 states have 16 as the age of consent. This is why when people use legality as an excuse like it\u2019s set in stone, I have to roll my eyes. You cannot tell me a 16 year old is a fully functioning adult even though legally some states have set that as an age of consent. I mean some countries have it set to 14 so maybe legality shouldn\u2019t be used as a barometer of what is acceptable.",

It alludes your understanding apparently\n\n\u2014 I\u2019m not abusing my power as a CEO. You\u2019re implying something more than what I said. I said my company has a legal department that deals with \u201cstrict liability\u201d cases daily, and in large numbers. So It shouldn\u2019t come ad a surprise to you, that as owner, and CEO of the company, that over the course of several decades of dealing with these cases I\u2019ve consulted my legal department a da*n near indefinite amount of times. As a result, I\u2019ve become intimately familiar with these types of cases.\n\nI also said, that I sought out a DIFFERENT law firm to draft my premeditated legal defense, regarding my extracurricular Sagaring activities.\n\n\u2014 For the love of GOD, again, I\u2019ve never even remotely suggested that. \n\nMy legal defense is a premeditated line of defense against a slew of problems that anyone sugaring could encounter in this lifestyle. \n\nOP mentioned, to be careful of underage girls potentially lying about their age, and my response has been about how to protect yourself if you ever found yourself in that situation\u2026 Nothing more, and nothing less!!!\n\nI HAVE NOT EVER GIVEN ADVICE ON HOW TO GET AWAY WITH RAPING A TEENAGER!!!!

It alludes your understanding apparently\n\n\u2014 I\u2019m not abusing my power as a CEO. You\u2019re implying something more than what I said. I said my company has a legal department that deals with \u201cstrict liability\u201d cases daily, and in large numbers. So It shouldn\u2019t come ad a surprise to you, that as owner, and CEO of the company, that over the course of several decades of dealing with these cases I\u2019ve consulted my legal department a da*n near indefinite amount of times. As a result, I\u2019ve become intimately familiar with these types of cases.\n\nI also said, that I sought out a DIFFERENT law firm to draft my premeditated legal defense, regarding my extracurricular Sagaring activities.\n\n\u2014 For the love of GOD, again, I\u2019ve never even remotely suggested that. \n\nMy legal defense is a premeditated line of defense against a slew of problems that anyone sugaring could encounter in this lifestyle. \n\nOP mentioned, to be careful of underage girls potentially lying about their age, and my response has been about how to protect yourself if you ever found yourself in that situation\u2026 Nothing more, and nothing less!!!\n\nI HAVE NOT EVER GIVEN ADVICE ON HOW TO GET AWAY WITH RAPING A TEENAGER!!!!

I said my company has a legal department that deals with \u201cstrict liability\u201d cases daily, and in large numbers. So It shouldn\u2019t come ad a surprise to you, that as owner, and CEO of the company, that over the course of several decades of dealing with these cases I\u2019ve consulted my legal department a da*n near indefinite amount of times. As a result, I\u2019ve become intimately familiar with these types of cases.\n\nI also said, that I sought out a DIFFERENT law firm to draft my premeditated legal defense, regarding my extracurricular Sagaring activities.\n\n\u2014 For the love of GOD, again, I\u2019ve never even remotely suggested that. \n\nMy legal defense is a premeditated line of defense against a slew of problems that anyone sugaring could encounter in this lifestyle. \n\nOP mentioned, to be careful of underage girls potentially lying about their age, and my response has been about how to protect yourself if you ever found yourself in that situation\u2026 Nothing more, and nothing less!!!\n\nI HAVE NOT EVER GIVEN ADVICE ON HOW TO GET AWAY WITH RAPING A TEENAGER!!!!

It alludes your understanding apparently\n\n\u2014 I\u2019m not abusing my power as a CEO. You\u2019re implying something more than what I said. I said my company has a legal department that deals with \u201cstrict liability\u201d cases daily, and in large numbers. So It shouldn\u2019t come ad a surprise to you, that as owner, and CEO of the company, that over the course of several decades of dealing with these cases I\u2019ve consulted my legal department a da*n near indefinite amount of times. As a result, I\u2019ve become intimately familiar with these types of cases.\n\nI also said, that I sought out a DIFFERENT law firm to draft my premeditated legal defense, regarding my extracurricular Sagaring activities.\n\n\u2014 For the love of GOD, again, I\u2019ve never even remotely suggested that. \n\nMy legal defense is a premeditated line of defense against a slew of problems that anyone sugaring could encounter in this lifestyle. \n\nOP mentioned, to be careful of underage girls potentially lying about their age, and my response has been about how to protect yourself if you ever found yourself in that situation\u2026 Nothing more, and nothing less!!!\n\nI HAVE NOT EVER GIVEN ADVICE ON HOW TO GET AWAY WITH RAPING A TEENAGER!!!!

Jesus, what a ridiculous accusation to make!\n\n\n\u201c\u201d\u201dRanked in least to most horrible:\n\n\u2022\t\u2060You got advice this shitty from your investment\n\u2022\t\u2060You are apparently abusing your power as \"CEO\" to get legal advice regarding your personal life from your company's legal department\n\u2022\t\u2060YOU ARE SEEKING LEGAL ADVICE ON HOW TO HEY AWAY WITH RAPING TEENAGERS\u201d\u201d\u201d\n\n \u2014 the advice is solid. It alludes your understanding apparently\n\n\u2014 I\u2019m not abusing my power as a CEO. You\u2019re implying something more than what I said. I said my company has a legal department that deals with \u201cstrict liability\u201d cases daily, and in large numbers. So It shouldn\u2019t come ad a surprise to you, that as owner, and CEO of the company, that over the course of several decades of dealing with these cases I\u2019ve consulted my legal department a da*n near indefinite amount of times. As a result, I\u2019ve become intimately familiar with these types of cases.\n\nI also said, that I sought out a DIFFERENT law firm to draft my premeditated legal defense, regarding my extracurricular Sagaring activities.\n\n\u2014 For the love of GOD, again, I\u2019ve never even remotely suggested that. \n\nMy legal defense is a premeditated line of defense against a slew of problems that anyone sugaring could encounter in this lifestyle. \n\nOP mentioned, to be careful of underage girls potentially lying about their age, and my response has been about how to protect yourself if you ever found yourself in that situation\u2026 Nothing more, and nothing less!!!\n\nI HAVE NOT EVER GIVEN ADVICE ON HOW TO GET AWAY WITH RAPING A TEENAGER!!!!
