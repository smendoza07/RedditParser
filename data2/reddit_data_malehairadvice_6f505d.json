I'm not a fan of trying to sell a result to a client; if u can't find faith in ur own look then u need a different cut. I've seen some gnarly cuts and some of them looked perfect on the guy rocking the cut, keep in mind they only looked good because the guy rocked out like a boss. I've also seen some amazing cuts ruined by apprehensive clientele; and I truly believe that this is a crime against good barbers everywhere!! My only advice is to ask the guy in the photo; his is the only answer that matters. If ur that guy and u don't like the results then u need to be honest with urself and try another look.",
