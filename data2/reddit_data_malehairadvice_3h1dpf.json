I also see you use a lot of product. That also can camouflage a less-than perfect cut. \n\nA good cut will last for weeks, possibly even months. This one probably won't, but hey - it was free, it looks good now, and you can do it again (yeah, I could rarely replicate a good cut, but I'm female and have long curly strange hair).\n\nBut good luck to you!
