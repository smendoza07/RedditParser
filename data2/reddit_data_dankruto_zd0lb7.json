And not some outcast living alone in a dorm room.\n\n\nEdit: And that child is told his father died a hero saving fucking everyone, including him and that\u2019s why he\u2019s not here. Making him think he was some fucking lost unwanted orphan\u2026it sickens me.",

I think I remember the elders being pissed that Kushina went around town and told Mikoto.\n\nNone of the villagers know anything. All they knew was that the 4th saved them all and that Nine Tails is sealed in Naruto\u2019s body. They don\u2019t know Naruto\u2019s relationship to the 4th.\n\nThe 4th Hokage sealing the Nine Tails inside the body of a boy doesn\u2019t tell us anything about the boy\u2019s lineage. For all we know, the 4th used the boy because the boy was evil and compatible with the Nine Tails. The fact that Naruto grew up to be mischievous could support the idea.",

I get part of Naruto's whole schtick is being recognized and loved.

For all we know, the 4th used the boy because the boy was evil and compatible with the Nine Tails. The fact that Naruto grew up to be mischievous could support the idea.",
