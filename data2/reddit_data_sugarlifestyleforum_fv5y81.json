    "body": "So I just got back from a sugar date and had a great time! I wasn't feeling well as I was hungover but tried to play it off. This was my second time meeting with him. I wasn't thrilled the first time but figured I would give him another shot. \n\nI went to his house and he lives on 102 acres so we went kayaking, hiking played Bocce ball. We had a picnic, he made ribs for dinner etc. I wasn't feeling well and so he offered to read me stories while I rested. At first I was like do what now? And he said yeah I'll read some short stories from Edgar Allen Poe and you can rest. So I said sure and first of all, he's a great story teller and second of I fell right asleep in his arms! \n\nWe got to talking and he asked me about sex positions I liked. And I said well...I'm a pillow princess mostly. And he said okay princess what do you like? I just melted. He said he knew I was a sub from the first date, which I'm not sure how he knew but man he is good! I was able to be in little space around him too with no problems as I worry about that. He was sweet and accommodating and really liked me! I'm so happy I finally found a SD especially during this time! If you are still looking, don't give up! It took me nearly 6 months to find him but I did!",
