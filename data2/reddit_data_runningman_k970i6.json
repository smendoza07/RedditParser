            "body": "I opened IG this morning to see a stream of love and support from the RM family for JK\u2019s new song and I was so touched to see all of it! It was so sweet and heartwarming! WELL DESERVED SUPPORT TBH BC HIS SONG IS BEAUTIFUL! \ud83d\ude2d\u2665\ufe0f \uc0ac\ub791\ud574\uc694 \uae40\uc885\uad6d-\uc624\ube60! and sm love to the rest of the RM family \u2665\ufe0f\n\nJSJ: The lyrics are so good.  It's a memory that somebody has and the other doesn't, but it's sad just by imagination.\n\nHaha: Kim Jong-guk, I made it .. This album that I released after a long time .. makes me cry.  exactly!  exactly!  Listen.  Organize everything.  It's cruel My brother.. Give me some often!  I'm going crazy .. \u3160\u3160 (*cri*) It's really the best..\n\nSo Min: I asked before walking back on the road I had come back to  \"Do you think there will be greater happiness than this?\". The amount of happiness that we put on our ability was much heavier on my side. Lastly, I always like near my house. It is the way out with confidence that I will come back alone.\n\nLKS: I love you Kim Jong Kook\u2665\ufe0f",
