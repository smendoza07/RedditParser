They will get what you look like.  Tease. \n\nYour profile almost *actually* says nothing about the situation you\u2019re looking for or what you offer to someone besides being a very sweet/gentle/bubbly boy. would you like to appeal to more clients or demographics? \n\nYou say you\u2019re a polyglot who likes cultures and you\u2019re looking for someone with similar ideologies as you who likes to be active. \n\nCan you break that up in paragraphs or say just that?  I felt like I read a bunch of non direct filler\n\nMaybe you don\u2019t know, but  your seeking and about me  content has almost no Info to do with the nature of an arrangement if someone peeped your profile. Which is fine I guess that\u2019s what conversation is for. \n\nI would say what kind of male you\u2019re seeking or ideal Situation. \nIn there you should say what you hope the nature of the relationship is. \nLF a travel companion, open/monogamous ,NSA FWB, 1-2-4 times a month, ongoing/ONS \nmutually beneficial  etc etc \u201cto spark joy in both our lives and establish a genuine connection\u201d etc \n\nSince you\u2019re the baby it has to be flirty but",
