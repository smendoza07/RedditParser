    "body": "Occasionally I have been faced with the awkward situation of being asked if I am/have ever been a sugar baby by a vanilla man 2x my age (or older) that finds me attractive. When I say yes these men will have a snarky comment or degrading reply. But I also don't understand why a 19-25 year old woman with decent self esteem would want to engage in a relationship with a man significantly older than her that does not want to at least take her on a nice date when she can find a much younger guy (that is less financially stable) that has no contribution other than sex. Usually these men have no problem asking for sexual favors. Opinions as to why this is a thing? ",

Absent other incentives, why would you choose an older, less physically attractive man over a hotter man closer to your age?  \n\nThe men who denigrate you are just trying to game you.  The hope is that you're naive enough that you'll buy their line, and choose to have sex with them for less than they would pay for the services of an escort.  \n\n",

I would also say I am rich, educated, cultured and a global citizen. \n\n90% of my SBs are 27 to 33 years old. Some of them lied about their ages especially those over 30. They claimed they were 27. They have shared the profiles of their ex vanilla lovers and despite these girls being so attractive these vanilla dudes are anything but. Lots of fat boys, short boys, skinny guys with thick glasses, nerdy ones etc. Plus most were older than me and enormously less successful compared to me. Some were outright loser artists and musicians. One guy made all of 35k as a 44 year old and lived in the projects with his mom. Fantastic indeed!\n\nAnother thing these ladies have on the site and outside claimed they like older men vs younger boys. Really!? If they do, why do they want the older man to pay them to date them.\n\nWhen they are with me, I treat them to royalty. 2 days back I took my current Latina SB out to dinner to Eleven Madison in NYC. Tonight having a date at another upscale place in Manhattan. That\u2019s quite routine on top of trips abroad and 5 star living. \n\nDespite all this I still pay them cash. A ppm is always there at the end of the date.\n\nWhy? Just because I can let them go anytime I want. With cash I can date whoever I want and faster. Cash puts a solid boundary on what they can expect and what not. I am not seeking their love or affection just their company although half of my SBs have asked me if I wanted an LTR. NOPE. If I wanted that I would seek it elsewhere. There is no shortage of educated, cultured women who belong to solid backgrounds who can fill that void. Those are LTR material. You don\u2019t seek or find them on seeking. \n\nSo there are reasons why men should pay cash. I don\u2019t make an effort to treat my SBs to a good life, I just live a good life. They join in. I let them go when I get bored or very busy. Thanks to the cash! No hard feelings, thanks to the cash. No stalking or drama post break up, thanks to the cash. Simple. \n\nSBs, you deserve to get paid but think twice when you claim you \u201clike older men\u201d and then belittle them on this forum for them being ugly.",

So you know, basically a blow up doll. \n\nWhich is what I recommend for them when I speak to them.

Could you elaborate for me?\n\nI've had more than one relationship with a woman in her early 20's simply because she appreciates who I am and what I am about.  Although I am in my late 30's and not 2x their age.  The most recent was a 23 year old that was starting a similar career track that got me to where I am at today.  She appreciated my insight, feedback, and mentoring.  She also appreciated that  we could go out and do things together and it wasn't uncomfortable for her, since the majority of her friends were not making the same money she makes (\\~$115k/yr when we met, and \\~$155k/yr after my mentoring her).    She was wise beyond her years, and we had a lot of fun spending time together.  You could say she got some value out of our relationship with my experience and mentoring.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've also had tinder women (all ages), want something from me, that I was not willing to participate in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think late 20's to mid 30's is my ideal age range.  21 is the minimum (legally able to go out for a drink is a hard requirement of mine), and most early 20's are very immature (not all, and I don't only judge based on number).",

As a man, I pay for dates and courting in the vanilla world - and I help financially whomever I am in a committed relationship with - whether it's vanilla or sugar and regardless of age. I offer what I can and help her to be as enabled for success as possible - whether it's school, work, whatever. \n\nYou asked a very simple question - _\"Why would a 60 yo want a 19 year old anyways?\"_ and I answered it. Basic biology. It doesn't need to really go any further than that. But I will point out two things:\n\n* Tinder is a hookup site. You cannot nor should you make any judgement calls as to whether a person on Tinder (regardless of age) is willing to pay money or not. You're using Tinder at that point just like a drug \"off label\". If you don't like the results, don't complain - just move on.  I can accept people bitching about this on \"Seeking\" or other sugar-based sites. But Tinder? Nope. If people are delusional - let them have their delusion and move on.\n\n* So older people seeing older people should just be \"cool\" about the finance thing, because hey, they're dating in their bracket? What kind of ageist bullshit is that? LMAO!\n\nI'll say this out loud - Personally if a 20 year old woman is with a 22 year old dude that has no direction, drive or would rather kick back with his bro's and smoke a blunt rather than \"be everything he can\" and help the woman financially as a part of being in a relationship? And she puts up with this bullshit?! Then the 20 year old woman is an idiot and she gets what she asked for and gets zero sympathy from me.  \n\nAnd I still find it utterly amusing that so many women on this forum find it incomprehensible that there are, in fact, early twenties women who actually LIKE to be with much older guys irrespective of what financial help they receive. Interestingly enough I find this to happen more often than successful guys paying for platonic relationships - at least based on _personal_ experience. \n\nTotal number of under-28 yo women that choose to be a fuck-buddy for whatever reason and who don't want and refuse \"payment\" beyond the \"date\" itself? Five.\n\nTotal number of \"platonic\" relationships I have paid for? Zero.\n\nAgain, that is just me. I cannot speak for anyone else :-)",

I would also say I am rich, educated, cultured and a global citizen. \n\n90% of my SBs are 27 to 33 years old. Some of them lied about their ages especially those over 30. They claimed they were 27. They have shared the profiles of their ex vanilla lovers and despite these girls being so attractive these vanilla dudes are anything but. Lots of fat boys, short boys, skinny guys with thick glasses, nerdy ones etc. Plus most were older than me and enormously less successful compared to me. Some were outright loser artists and musicians. One guy made all of 35k as a 44 year old and lived in the projects with his mom. Fantastic indeed!\n\nAnother thing these ladies have on the site and outside claimed they like older men vs younger boys. Really!? If they do, why do they want the older man to pay them to date them.\n\nWhen they are with me, I treat them to royalty. 2 days back I took my current Latina SB out to dinner to Eleven Madison in NYC. Tonight having a date at another upscale place in Manhattan. That\u2019s quite routine on top of trips abroad and 5 star living. \n\nDespite all this I still pay them cash. A ppm is always there at the end of the date.\n\nWhy? Just because I can let them go anytime I want. With cash I can date whoever I want and faster. Cash puts a solid boundary on what they can expect and what not. I am not seeking their love or affection just their company although half of my SBs have asked me if I wanted an LTR. NOPE. If I wanted that I would seek it elsewhere. There is no shortage of educated, cultured women who belong to solid backgrounds who can fill that void. Those are LTR material. You don\u2019t seek or find them on seeking. \n\nSo there are reasons why men should pay cash. I don\u2019t make an effort to treat my SBs to a good life, I just live a good life. They join in. I let them go when I get bored or very busy. Thanks to the cash! No hard feelings, thanks to the cash. No stalking or drama post break up, thanks to the cash. Simple. \n\nSBs, you deserve to get paid but think twice when you claim you \u201clike older men\u201d and then belittle them on this forum for them being ugly.",

Although I am in my late 30's and not 2x their age.  The most recent was a 23 year old that was starting a similar career track that got me to where I am at today.  She appreciated my insight, feedback, and mentoring.  She also appreciated that  we could go out and do things together and it wasn't uncomfortable for her, since the majority of her friends were not making the same money she makes (\\~$115k/yr when we met, and \\~$155k/yr after my mentoring her).    She was wise beyond her years, and we had a lot of fun spending time together.  You could say she got some value out of our relationship with my experience and mentoring.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've also had tinder women (all ages), want something from me, that I was not willing to participate in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think late 20's to mid 30's is my ideal age range.  21 is the minimum (legally able to go out for a drink is a hard requirement of mine), and most early 20's are very immature (not all, and I don't only judge based on number).",

As a man, I pay for dates and courting in the vanilla world - and I help financially whomever I am in a committed relationship with - whether it's vanilla or sugar and regardless of age. I offer what I can and help her to be as enabled for success as possible - whether it's school, work, whatever. \n\nYou asked a very simple question - _\"Why would a 60 yo want a 19 year old anyways?\"_ and I answered it. Basic biology. It doesn't need to really go any further than that. But I will point out two things:\n\n* Tinder is a hookup site. You cannot nor should you make any judgement calls as to whether a person on Tinder (regardless of age) is willing to pay money or not. You're using Tinder at that point just like a drug \"off label\". If you don't like the results, don't complain - just move on.  I can accept people bitching about this on \"Seeking\" or other sugar-based sites. But Tinder? Nope. If people are delusional - let them have their delusion and move on.\n\n* So older people seeing older people should just be \"cool\" about the finance thing, because hey, they're dating in their bracket? What kind of ageist bullshit is that? LMAO!\n\nI'll say this out loud - Personally if a 20 year old woman is with a 22 year old dude that has no direction, drive or would rather kick back with his bro's and smoke a blunt rather than \"be everything he can\" and help the woman financially as a part of being in a relationship? And she puts up with this bullshit?! Then the 20 year old woman is an idiot and she gets what she asked for and gets zero sympathy from me.  \n\nAnd I still find it utterly amusing that so many women on this forum find it incomprehensible that there are, in fact, early twenties women who actually LIKE to be with much older guys irrespective of what financial help they receive. Interestingly enough I find this to happen more often than successful guys paying for platonic relationships - at least based on _personal_ experience. \n\nTotal number of under-28 yo women that choose to be a fuck-buddy for whatever reason and who don't want and refuse \"payment\" beyond the \"date\" itself? Five.\n\nTotal number of \"platonic\" relationships I have paid for? Zero.\n\nAgain, that is just me. I cannot speak for anyone else :-)",

Although I am in my late 30's and not 2x their age.  The most recent was a 23 year old that was starting a similar career track that got me to where I am at today.  She appreciated my insight, feedback, and mentoring.  She also appreciated that  we could go out and do things together and it wasn't uncomfortable for her, since the majority of her friends were not making the same money she makes (\\~$115k/yr when we met, and \\~$155k/yr after my mentoring her).    She was wise beyond her years, and we had a lot of fun spending time together.  You could say she got some value out of our relationship with my experience and mentoring.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've also had tinder women (all ages), want something from me, that I was not willing to participate in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think late 20's to mid 30's is my ideal age range.  21 is the minimum (legally able to go out for a drink is a hard requirement of mine), and most early 20's are very immature (not all, and I don't only judge based on number).",

As a man, I pay for dates and courting in the vanilla world - and I help financially whomever I am in a committed relationship with - whether it's vanilla or sugar and regardless of age. I offer what I can and help her to be as enabled for success as possible - whether it's school, work, whatever. \n\nYou asked a very simple question - _\"Why would a 60 yo want a 19 year old anyways?\"_ and I answered it. Basic biology. It doesn't need to really go any further than that. But I will point out two things:\n\n* Tinder is a hookup site. You cannot nor should you make any judgement calls as to whether a person on Tinder (regardless of age) is willing to pay money or not. You're using Tinder at that point just like a drug \"off label\". If you don't like the results, don't complain - just move on.  I can accept people bitching about this on \"Seeking\" or other sugar-based sites. But Tinder? Nope. If people are delusional - let them have their delusion and move on.\n\n* So older people seeing older people should just be \"cool\" about the finance thing, because hey, they're dating in their bracket? What kind of ageist bullshit is that? LMAO!\n\nI'll say this out loud - Personally if a 20 year old woman is with a 22 year old dude that has no direction, drive or would rather kick back with his bro's and smoke a blunt rather than \"be everything he can\" and help the woman financially as a part of being in a relationship? And she puts up with this bullshit?! Then the 20 year old woman is an idiot and she gets what she asked for and gets zero sympathy from me.  \n\nAnd I still find it utterly amusing that so many women on this forum find it incomprehensible that there are, in fact, early twenties women who actually LIKE to be with much older guys irrespective of what financial help they receive. Interestingly enough I find this to happen more often than successful guys paying for platonic relationships - at least based on _personal_ experience. \n\nTotal number of under-28 yo women that choose to be a fuck-buddy for whatever reason and who don't want and refuse \"payment\" beyond the \"date\" itself? Five.\n\nTotal number of \"platonic\" relationships I have paid for? Zero.\n\nAgain, that is just me. I cannot speak for anyone else :-)",

Although I am in my late 30's and not 2x their age.  The most recent was a 23 year old that was starting a similar career track that got me to where I am at today.  She appreciated my insight, feedback, and mentoring.  She also appreciated that  we could go out and do things together and it wasn't uncomfortable for her, since the majority of her friends were not making the same money she makes (\\~$115k/yr when we met, and \\~$155k/yr after my mentoring her).    She was wise beyond her years, and we had a lot of fun spending time together.

                    "body": "I'm not mad at anything.\n\nI'm more of a \"gender role\" kind of old fashioned guy anyway. As a man, I pay for dates and courting in the vanilla world - and I help financially whomever I am in a committed relationship with - whether it's vanilla or sugar and regardless of age. I offer what I can and help her to be as enabled for success as possible - whether it's school, work, whatever. \n\nYou asked a very simple question - _\"Why would a 60 yo want a 19 year old anyways?\"_ and I answered it. Basic biology. It doesn't need to really go any further than that. But I will point out two things:\n\n* Tinder is a hookup site. You cannot nor should you make any judgement calls as to whether a person on Tinder (regardless of age) is willing to pay money or not. You're using Tinder at that point just like a drug \"off label\". If you don't like the results, don't complain - just move on.  I can accept people bitching about this on \"Seeking\" or other sugar-based sites. But Tinder? Nope. If people are delusional - let them have their delusion and move on.\n\n* So older people seeing older people should just be \"cool\" about the finance thing, because hey, they're dating in their bracket? What kind of ageist bullshit is that? LMAO!\n\nI'll say this out loud - Personally if a 20 year old woman is with a 22 year old dude that has no direction, drive or would rather kick back with his bro's and smoke a blunt rather than \"be everything he can\" and help the woman financially as a part of being in a relationship? And she puts up with this bullshit?! Then the 20 year old woman is an idiot and she gets what she asked for and gets zero sympathy from me.  \n\nAnd I still find it utterly amusing that so many women on this forum find it incomprehensible that there are, in fact, early twenties women who actually LIKE to be with much older guys irrespective of what financial help they receive. Interestingly enough I find this to happen more often than successful guys paying for platonic relationships - at least based on _personal_ experience. \n\nTotal number of under-28 yo women that choose to be a fuck-buddy for whatever reason and who don't want and refuse \"payment\" beyond the \"date\" itself? Five.\n\nTotal number of \"platonic\" relationships I have paid for? Zero.\n\nAgain, that is just me. I cannot speak for anyone else :-)",
