    "body": "We\u2019re in our favourite little hotel in our favourite room in the city. He tended to a morning Zoom meeting while I watch from under the sheets. After an hour, he\u2019s cancelling all his meetings scheduled for later in the day and joined me in bed. \n\nWe\u2019re laying side by side after an intense intimate session, staring into each others eyes, his blue to my brown. My arm wrapped around his waist. His fingers tracing my face, my cheeks, my lips, tucking strands of hair behind my ears and smiling at me. \u201cYou are so beautiful,\u201d he says. It felt like a scene off a Nicholas Spark book but even better, this is real life and real life feels pretty freaking amazing right now. He\u2019s looking at me deeply. My cheeks hurt from smiling so hard. We are so happy. \n\nIt\u2019s all sweet.",

So tell me what is the difference?\n\nAre you comparing SB's to apartments?  With a physical object to be used based on money?  Thought SB's are supposed to be \"more\" than that.\n\nAnd to directly answer the question of course not. You both agreed to treat each others as partners and burden share.  Thats fair and egalitarian.  SB's dont want to be treated fair and egalitarian.  They dont want to burden share. They want to be bought and paid for like an apartment apparently based on your example",

So now I will make my point. Maybe if more men today thought it common place or naturally expected to make sure their (girlfriend/mistress/friend etc) was taken care of instead of  making a point to try to get as much from women (mentally/emotionally/physically)  for nothing, there wouldn't be a sugar bowl and sugaring sites and all of this would be moot.",

Maybe if more men today thought it common place or naturally expected to make sure their (girlfriend/mistress/friend etc) was taken care of instead of  making a point to try to get as much from women (mentally/emotionally/physically)  for nothing, there wouldn't be a sugar bowl and sugaring sites and all of this would be moot.",

Sugar...its all about the Sugar...with no Sugar it doesn't exist.\n\n> I was using a traditional relationship example to parallel a sugaring relationship if the SD no longer wants to provide support.\n\nYour example made no sense as I pointed out.  So now Im not sure where you're going with your argument.  SB/SD relationships are nothing like traditional relationships",

And if they feelings were absolutely genuine how can you continue to take his money...to keep the pay for play scheme in place.\n\nYou're talking like I'm walking around all day thinking about this girl and \"how she expresses her happiness\".  I'm not.  These discussions are fun to me because according to \"my\" judgement (and I'm willing to bet the average persons if you were to take a poll) these feelings make no sense given the pay to play nature. And even less sense to continue the pay to play nature if they're legit.",

You are obviously very strong in your opinion which is either totally baseless or you have been dumped by one too many SBs because you thought you should be able to stop providing them your mutual side of the arrangement but still get theirs.  So now I will make my point. Maybe if more men today thought it common place or naturally expected to make sure their (girlfriend/mistress/friend etc) was taken care of instead of  making a point to try to get as much from women (mentally/emotionally/physically)  for nothing, there wouldn't be a sugar bowl and sugaring sites and all of this would be moot.",

Thought SB's are supposed to be \"more\" than that.\n\nAnd to directly answer the question of course not. You both agreed to treat each others as partners and burden share.

You are obviously very strong in your opinion which is either totally baseless or you have been dumped by one too many SBs because you thought you should be able to stop providing them your mutual side of the arrangement but still get theirs.  So now I will make my point. Maybe if more men today thought it common place or naturally expected to make sure their (girlfriend/mistress/friend etc) was taken care of instead of  making a point to try to get as much from women (mentally/emotionally/physically)  for nothing, there wouldn't be a sugar bowl and sugaring sites and all of this would be moot.",

Thought SB's are supposed to be \"more\" than that.\n\nAnd to directly answer the question of course not. You both agreed to treat each others as partners and burden share.

Maybe if more men today thought it common place or naturally expected to make sure their (girlfriend/mistress/friend etc) was taken care of instead of  making a point to try to get as much from women (mentally/emotionally/physically)  for nothing, there wouldn't be a sugar bowl and sugaring sites and all of this would be moot.",

Thats fair and egalitarian.  SB's dont want to be treated fair and egalitarian.  They dont want to burden share. They want to be bought and paid for like an apartment apparently based on your example",

Take away that he is chiselled and popular and has beautiful eyes and she wouldn't love him.  She's only with him because he's tall and handsome.  He's only with her because she is young and beautiful.  She makes him feel special.  He's nice to her.  He spoils her.  He makes her laugh.  Take away all the things we like about our relationships and none of us would love anyone.  What IS a real feeling?  What is a real relationship?",

So tell me what is the difference?\n\nAre you comparing SB's to apartments?  With a physical object to be used based on money?  Thought SB's are supposed to be \"more\" than that.\n\nAnd to directly answer the question of course not. You both agreed to treat each others as partners and burden share.  Thats fair and egalitarian.  SB's dont want to be treated fair and egalitarian.  They dont want to burden share. They want to be bought and paid for like an apartment apparently based on your example",

So now Im not sure where you're going with your argument.  SB/SD relationships are nothing like traditional relationships",

If I don't pay my rent I get evicted. So tell me what is the difference?",

So tell me what is the difference?\n\nAre you comparing SB's to apartments?  With a physical object to be used based on money?  Thought SB's are supposed to be \"more\" than that.\n\nAnd to directly answer the question of course not. You both agreed to treat each others as partners and burden share.  Thats fair and egalitarian.  SB's dont want to be treated fair and egalitarian.  They dont want to burden share. They want to be bought and paid for like an apartment apparently based on your example",

Thought SB's are supposed to be \"more\" than that.\n\nAnd to directly answer the question of course not. You both agreed to treat each others as partners and burden share.  Thats fair and egalitarian.  SB's dont want to be treated fair and egalitarian.  They dont want to burden share. They want to be bought and paid for like an apartment apparently based on your example",

Thought SB's are supposed to be \"more\" than that.\n\nAnd to directly answer the question of course not. You both agreed to treat each others as partners and burden share.  Thats fair and egalitarian.  SB's dont want to be treated fair and egalitarian.  They dont want to burden share. They want to be bought and paid for like an apartment apparently based on your example",
