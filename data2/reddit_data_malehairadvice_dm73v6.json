After that, I apply a little matte pomade and hair spray, and I'm usually good for the day. But my Asian hair just doesn't wanna stay up, and I lose 1/4 - 1/3 of my volume through the day. Sometimes I'll style it a bit more up than I typically like, because by the time I get to class it's settled into a nice shape",

After that, I apply a little matte pomade and hair spray, and I'm usually good for the day. But my Asian hair just doesn't wanna stay up, and I lose 1/4 - 1/3 of my volume through the day.

After that, I apply a little matte pomade and hair spray, and I'm usually good for the day. But my Asian hair just doesn't wanna stay up, and I lose 1/4 - 1/3 of my volume through the day. Sometimes I'll style it a bit more up than I typically like, because by the time I get to class it's settled into a nice shape",

After that, I apply a little matte pomade and hair spray, and I'm usually good for the day. But my Asian hair just doesn't wanna stay up, and I lose 1/4 - 1/3 of my volume through the day.

I style it by squishing gel in when soaking wet, so the curl pattern doesn't get separated, then I air dry, and when it's completely dry and crunchy I scrunch out the cast that the gel leaves. It's all from r/curlyhair. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/54FsqXW.png)'s how it usually looks when it's a bit longer and [here](https://i.imgur.com/5nlS3gl.png) it is quite a bit longer.",

I style it by squishing gel in when soaking wet, so the curl pattern doesn't get separated, then I air dry, and when it's completely dry and crunchy I scrunch out the cast that the gel leaves. It's all from r/curlyhair. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/54FsqXW.png)'s how it usually looks when it's a bit longer and [here](https://i.imgur.com/5nlS3gl.png) it is quite a bit longer.",
