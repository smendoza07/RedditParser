Shikamaru has raw intelligence but Sakura is \"book smart\". She was the only one to complete the chunin written exam with 100% without \"cheating\". Both Sasuke and Neji resorted to cheating despite being the top of their classes. Kishimoto also stated in a guidebook (could have been the fanbook) that \"Sakura is easily one of the most intelligent in the village...\"\n\n By the time she was a teenager, several top ninjas had declared her a match to or having surpassed Tsunade in strength and intelligence (Chiyo, Shizune, Hashirama, Sasori, Tsunade- to name a few). Kishimoto outright confirmed this in the fourth guidebook- she is considered the most skilled kunoichi in Konoha history. \n\nShikamaru excels at gathering info and using it to solve problems. He'll take everything at hand and use it to win (But it's been shown several times that Shikamaru isn't very efficient lol- Compared to Kakashi who can devise a winning plan far quicker while using less).",

Naruto healing is good but he doesn't even have it anymore and it wasn't as good as getting healed by a pro\n\nSo what if it sensed that it wasn't even sage mode it was kurama mode something naruto doesn't have. Even then it wasn't hal the planet away. The naruto world is small. Why mention things he doesn't have. Naruto needs to focus to do that and needs kyuubi to sense specific people. Ino does it when she is asleep.\n\nLike dude you are a dumbass naruto cannot sense 24/7 never said jack about him sucking at sensory at all.",

No financial hardship first of all. Having everything paid for must be pretty nice\n\nAre you right in your mind ?? If a family has financial hardships does it concern only the earning member of the family ? What kind of a weird mechanic is that ?

She has other duties too.\n\n>But being a stay at home parent is fucking cake.\n\nYou are either ignorant or have not actually seen how a family functions.\n\nWhat you said feels more like a few people living together under a roof rather than those people actually being a family.",

Like doing physical labour at a factory ?? (That means being quite poor ) Well then the situation would be quite harsh even for the house husband/wife. \n\nAren't you narrowing down the work they're doing btw...Like specifically a factory worker.

Hanabi was stronger than Hinata and defeated her even though she's 5 years younger than her. \n\n>Cause the only other married female clan member example is Ino and she became the head just fine. Or is that because she married Sai who takes her last name and became a Yamanaka?\n\nTbh, I don't think gender is an issue when it comes to being the clan head.",

I assume the head of a clan is required to bear the clan's name, so I was just wondering if in the case of Hinata, can she still be head of Hyuga while also bearing her husband's Uzumaki name? Or is Naruto required to take up the Hyuga name so his wife can still bear the Hyuga name?\n\nAll of this assumes that the law in Naruto world is the same that is applied in real life Japan, where spouses are required to have the same surname.",

I'm not saying Hanabi is not a good future head of the clan but like, I feel like they made Hinata's character settle! I would have even been happy to see her, make ointments and herbs and sell them? have a restaurant or something? but at the same time, with Naruto being Hokage he's never home, the kids needed at least one stable parent who could be at every event. \n\nit is what it is and I'm not complaining but I've read a  lot of fanfics that have expanded on the awesome qualities Hinata has.",

And he started as actually cool character. Unfortunately quickly I was proven that I was right in the beginning and I shouldn't think that he isn't as bad as he was 15 years ago.

Both Sasuke and Neji resorted to cheating despite being the top of their classes. Kishimoto also stated in a guidebook (could have been the fanbook) that \"Sakura is easily one of the most intelligent in the village...\"\n\n By the time she was a teenager, several top ninjas had declared her a match to or having surpassed Tsunade in strength and intelligence (Chiyo, Shizune, Hashirama, Sasori, Tsunade- to name a few). Kishimoto outright confirmed this in the fourth guidebook- she is considered the most skilled kunoichi in Konoha history. \n\nShikamaru excels at gathering info and using it to solve problems. He'll take everything at hand and use it to win (But it's been shown several times that Shikamaru isn't very efficient lol- Compared to Kakashi who can devise a winning plan far quicker while using less).",

If Hanabi would die and failed to conceive an heir , Himawari is still a kid and they need to replace Hiashi, it is most likely that Hinata would assume the position until Himawari would be of age.\n\n But to answer your question, the Hyuga heir would be Himawari, not Boruto because of Byakugan. Boruto can't lead a Clan with Byakugan if he doesnt have Byakugan himself unless Jougan would have some Byakugan like abilities but even so, i highly doubt it.

A lot of countries have an issue where housewives and husbands do a lot of work on say a farm and with raising children (often times more than a regularly employed person ever does), but get labelled as unemployed and are seen in a negative light, despite being necessary. \n\nIn most countries a small family-owned farm can only employ 1 employee, that usually being the husband. Meaning despite the wife working just as much she gets no guarantee. By propagating stereotypes like the one in the meme,  it makes it hard to fight for the rights of such people, since most people agree without knowing the whole situation.

No financial hardship first of all. Having everything paid for must be pretty nice\n\nAre you right in your mind ?? If a family has financial hardships does it concern only the earning member of the family ? What kind of a weird mechanic is that ? Don't make it sound like a housewife or a househusband get money for free.\n\n\n>Even then taking care of a kid is less work than work physically. \n\nTaking care of a kid is more of a physical work than working on a computer.\n\n\n>Kids also start preschool soon.

She has other duties too.\n\n>But being a stay at home parent is fucking cake.\n\nYou are either ignorant or have not actually seen how a family functions.\n\nWhat you said feels more like a few people living together under a roof rather than those people actually being a family.",

Like doing physical labour at a factory ?? (That means being quite poor ) Well then the situation would be quite harsh even for the house husband/wife. \n\nAren't you narrowing down the work they're doing btw...Like specifically a factory worker.

I assume the head of a clan is required to bear the clan's name, so I was just wondering if in the case of Hinata, can she still be head of Hyuga while also bearing her husband's Uzumaki name?

She didnt take down one serious opponent either. \n\nThan why does she always take sasuke shit and insults? But cant stand naruto's criticisms.\n\nThe problem is she doesn't do anything to improve part one. She goes through these emotional moments and than proceed to daydream about sasuke. She doesnt practice self improvement in part 1 at all.\n\nI'm not mad she is weak and it wasnt a journey. Kishimoto has a history of doing this shit to female characters. Its laziness. Sarada being forgot about atm as well.\n\nMeanwhile characters like tenten actual train and are fodder. In all parts despite being able to use the sage of six path weapons.",

Where they start out as both having a typical crush on Sasuke despite knowing nothing about him, Sakura's behavior changes very quickly. Yeah, she still has a crush and acts like a fool but she's still a child. Sakura doesn't get power-ups in Part 1 but she still develops as a character. Sakura learns a lot in Part 1.\n\nI wouldn't blame Kishimoto for Sarada lol. Boruto is mainly Ikemoto's project and it shows. A *lot*.",

Shikamaru has raw intelligence but Sakura is \"book smart\". She was the only one to complete the chunin written exam with 100% without \"cheating\". Both Sasuke and Neji resorted to cheating despite being the top of their classes. Kishimoto also stated in a guidebook (could have been the fanbook) that \"Sakura is easily one of the most intelligent in the village...\"\n\n By the time she was a teenager, several top ninjas had declared her a match to or having surpassed Tsunade in strength and intelligence (Chiyo, Shizune, Hashirama, Sasori, Tsunade- to name a few). Kishimoto outright confirmed this in the fourth guidebook- she is considered the most skilled kunoichi in Konoha history. \n\nShikamaru excels at gathering info and using it to solve problems. He'll take everything at hand and use it to win (But it's been shown several times that Shikamaru isn't very efficient lol- Compared to Kakashi who can devise a winning plan far quicker while using less).",

Naruto healing is good but he doesn't even have it anymore and it wasn't as good as getting healed by a pro\n\nSo what if it sensed that it wasn't even sage mode it was kurama mode something naruto doesn't have. Even then it wasn't hal the planet away. The naruto world is small. Why mention things he doesn't have. Naruto needs to focus to do that and needs kyuubi to sense specific people. Ino does it when she is asleep.\n\nLike dude you are a dumbass naruto cannot sense 24/7 never said jack about him sucking at sensory at all.",

She was the only one to complete the chunin written exam with 100% without \"cheating\". Both Sasuke and Neji resorted to cheating despite being the top of their classes. Kishimoto also stated in a guidebook (could have been the fanbook) that \"Sakura is easily one of the most intelligent in the village...\"\n\n By the time she was a teenager, several top ninjas had declared her a match to or having surpassed Tsunade in strength and intelligence (Chiyo, Shizune, Hashirama, Sasori, Tsunade- to name a few). Kishimoto outright confirmed this in the fourth guidebook- she is considered the most skilled kunoichi in Konoha history. \n\nShikamaru excels at gathering info and using it to solve problems. He'll take everything at hand and use it to win (But it's been shown several times that Shikamaru isn't very efficient lol- Compared to Kakashi who can devise a winning plan far quicker while using less).",

Where they start out as both having a typical crush on Sasuke despite knowing nothing about him, Sakura's behavior changes very quickly. Yeah, she still has a crush and acts like a fool but she's still a child. Sakura doesn't get power-ups in Part 1 but she still develops as a character. Sakura learns a lot in Part 1.\n\nI wouldn't blame Kishimoto for Sarada lol. Boruto is mainly Ikemoto's project and it shows. A *lot*.",

She was the only one to complete the chunin written exam with 100% without \"cheating\". Both Sasuke and Neji resorted to cheating despite being the top of their classes. Kishimoto also stated in a guidebook (could have been the fanbook) that \"Sakura is easily one of the most intelligent in the village...\"\n\n By the time she was a teenager, several top ninjas had declared her a match to or having surpassed Tsunade in strength and intelligence (Chiyo, Shizune, Hashirama, Sasori, Tsunade- to name a few). Kishimoto outright confirmed this in the fourth guidebook- she is considered the most skilled kunoichi in Konoha history. \n\nShikamaru excels at gathering info and using it to solve problems. He'll take everything at hand and use it to win (But it's been shown several times that Shikamaru isn't very efficient lol- Compared to Kakashi who can devise a winning plan far quicker while using less).",

It was about having confidence and pride in herself and her current status is perfect in line with her character.  Also plenty of people in the Naruto fandom have  tried to use her choosing to be a housewife as evidence that she's poorly written",

Being an housewife may be less cool narratively or in the same universe of a fighting manga, but most people bringing her housewife status do so to diss her and her fans.

Kishimoto also stated in a guidebook (could have been the fanbook) that \"Sakura is easily one of the most intelligent in the village...\"\n\n By the time she was a teenager, several top ninjas had declared her a match to or having surpassed Tsunade in strength and intelligence (Chiyo, Shizune, Hashirama, Sasori, Tsunade- to name a few). Kishimoto outright confirmed this in the fourth guidebook- she is considered the most skilled kunoichi in Konoha history. \n\nShikamaru excels at gathering info and using it to solve problems. He'll take everything at hand and use it to win (But it's been shown several times that Shikamaru isn't very efficient lol- Compared to Kakashi who can devise a winning plan far quicker while using less).",

Even then it wasn't hal the planet away. The naruto world is small. Why mention things he doesn't have. Naruto needs to focus to do that and needs kyuubi to sense specific people.

And then once the kids are in school they kinda have alot more free time.",

Kishimoto also stated in a guidebook (could have been the fanbook) that \"Sakura is easily one of the most intelligent in the village...\"\n\n By the time she was a teenager, several top ninjas had declared her a match to or having surpassed Tsunade in strength and intelligence (Chiyo, Shizune, Hashirama, Sasori, Tsunade- to name a few). Kishimoto outright confirmed this in the fourth guidebook- she is considered the most skilled kunoichi in Konoha history. \n\nShikamaru excels at gathering info and using it to solve problems. He'll take everything at hand and use it to win (But it's been shown several times that Shikamaru isn't very efficient lol- Compared to Kakashi who can devise a winning plan far quicker while using less).",

Then they showed Sasuke in the village to tell the five kage about that whole Otsutsuki mission thing then left the village again lmao. They showed that in Naruto Gaiden manga.\n\n>for some reason, she couldn't tell or lie about him having glasses or not, so Sarada's curiosity and sadness turned into anger and distrust.\n\nSakura reached a whole new level of being pathetic on that one. And in the manga, she said something like she doesn't know because Sasuke was not in the village a lot even back then, which means Sakura doesn't really know a lot of things even the most simple things about her own husband \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
