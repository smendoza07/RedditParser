    "body": "SB has broken both her legs and her jaw in a car accident.  I\u2019m not sure how to handle the allowance.  She\u2019s great.  Lives near my work and host.  Allowance is reasonable.  It would be difficult to find another that offers everything she does.  Not sure how long it will be before things are back to normal for us.  Any thoughts on how to handle the allowance.  I\u2019ve broached the subject.  She asked if I wanted to adjust it.  I would like to help.  Not knowing how long she will be in recovery makes it a difficult decision.\n\nI\u2019ve known her 6 weeks.\n\nEdit:  Thanks so much for all the thoughtful responses that helped me gain perspective.  It\u2019s clear the right thing to do is pay her allowance.  In the end I won\u2019t miss the money and I will have done the right thing to help someone out regardless of the outcome.",

Specifically that - 2 months would be the end of the world.  Just like an SD that supposedly can't provide a given allowance/ppm due \"cash flow issues\".  I wouldn't be sugaring - if I didn't have a year's worth of living expenses sitting on the sidelines.  .",

And it's a reasonable question.  Given this, one possible response is: \"right now I just want you to get healthy, let's keep the allowance next month, we can worry about it in September if it comes to that\".  If you want to  buy yourself some wiggle room due to the uncertainty, this is the way to do it.  Without question, I would not even hear of lowering allowance at this point, even at her suggestion.  If we were on PPM, I'd find ways to support her.\n\nI agree with everyone saying \"don't just drop allowance on an SB whose presence in your life you value\".  I would also note that, pretty much 100% of the time, if an SB comes on here and says, \"my SD says he's going through a hard time and would like to lower the allowance for a little while\", the responses are nothing but outrage and \"block that loser\".   It's worth being aware that your generosity may not be met by similar generosity if the situation reverses.  That doesn't change my answer one bit, but it's good to realize the expectations are asymmetric.",

When I determined that I could take precautions to minimize risk, I proceeded to live a modified life. Sugar dating was not part of that early on. When cases went down during the summer, I decided it was OK to see my SB. When I was able to get vaccinated,  I did. So did my new SB. We are leading a relatively normal life now. I do understand that some people don't feel comfortable and I am not judging. Everyone needs to determine the risk they are willing to take. If you are vaccinated,  you shouldn't worry about anyone else. If that doesn't work for you, stay home. The world and life need to go on.",

            "body": "Oof. That's rough. I hope she makes a full recovery.\n\nAs for what to do, I feel a lot depends on circumstances. You mentioned you've known her for 6 weeks. How have things been so far? How emotionally invested are each of you? Clearly there's a difference between \"She's crazy, I was planning on ending our arrangement\" and \"I'm happy and hope this lasts for a long term period.\" \n\nSecond circumstances would be around the car accident. Trust but verify, was she actually in an accident? Is she actually in the hospital? How did the accident happen? Was anyone else injured? There's clearly a big difference between \"It wasn't my fault/I was hit by another car\" and \"I was drunk driving, doing 150 mph in a school zone and killed a dozen people\".\n\nLastly would be circumstances around recovery. How serious are her fractures? How long will it take her to recover? Is she expecting you to care for her while she recovers? Will any of her meds affect being intimate? [According to the NHS a minor leg fracture would take 1-2 months, while a major one could take 3-6 months.](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/broken-leg/). Clearly there's a difference between \"It's only minor injuries, I'll be back to normal in a month or two\" and \"I'm seriously injured, it'll take 8-12 months to physically recover, and I'm mentally traumatized and can never be intimate again because I was hit by the Oscar Mayer Weinermobile.\"\n\nClearly if you were hoping things would last long term, providing full support while she recovers would be incredibly appreciated by her. Most likely you'll have to find out more information, and then depending on your relationship figure out how to move forward from there. However, I do think it's reasonable to say that there are limits to generosity and supporting someone solely out of the goodness of your heart. Depending on the circumstances and length of her recovery.",

Breaking legs and jaw is at least a 3 to 8 month recovery, if we are talking femur fractures that's the better part of a year. And honestly, 6 weeks isn't a very long time to know somebody.

Or just paying for sex which so many say they\u2019re not doing? Like.. she\u2019ll still be talking to you and connecting with you right? Do you value her as a human? Because a lot of ppl here seem to be saying I\u2019m not paying for sex but also no sex means no allowance. Strange paradox. I would understand if she wouldn\u2019t be talking to you or spending any time with you\u2026. But a lot of guys here seem to be saying it\u2019s just money for sex but also I\u2019m not giving money for sex. Kind of hard to keep up, ppl could st least be transparent instead of repeatedly insisting they aren\u2019t doing exactly what they say they are doing\u2026 (\u201cyou\u201d is not directed to you OP, or the other good guys in this thread that actually have some humanity. Your edit clearly shows you to be a kind and high value man) it\u2019s just kind of weird the number of \u201cSD\u2019s\u201d that keep saying I\u2019m not paying for sex but I\u2019m not giving you an allowance if we can\u2019t have sex. The lack of self awareness is astonishing. If you value emotional intimacy like you claim this kind of situation has the potential to grow emotional intimacy by leaps and bounds. Depends on what you\u2019re actually looking for, I suppose.",

I was replying to a specific comment that stated \" SBs will drop you in a second if they find a better allowance\".  And I stand behind my statement.  \n\n> We are talking about where the SD loses his income entirely for 2 months and that is the only SD the SB has at that moment. Will the SB forego allowance and still spend time with him? Also note i would feel too shitty to be intimate if i lost my job\n\nI have to say, this commentary is typically baffling to me.  Specifically that - 2 months would be the end of the world.  Just like an SD that supposedly can't provide a given allowance/ppm due \"cash flow issues\".  I wouldn't be sugaring - if I didn't have a year's worth of living expenses sitting on the sidelines.  .",

She received an allowance, car , apartment, health insurance and traveled with me on business.\n\nI was a lover , friend , and mentor.\n\n2008 comes and my liquidity dries up.\n\nWe had a long talk , and I told her. Things will have to change for a bit. You can keep the car and apartment until the lease is up. But the health insurance and allowance has to stop. \n\nI didn\u2019t expect intimacy from her at this point. But all I was asking for was emotional support during these tough times in my life.\n\nWell it didn\u2019t go well. \n\nEvery time we spoke she always had a problem, and now that I wasn\u2019t Financially able to solve them. She had to go because she is depressed.\n\nNever mind what I was going through.\n\nSo if the Op decides to continue supporting her during these tough times. I would suggest thinking of her as a long term commitment, because you are now sharing a life experience..\n\nBut remember after she has recovered, she owes you nothing.",

When cases went down during the summer, I decided it was OK to see my SB. When I was able to get vaccinated,  I did. So did my new SB. We are leading a relatively normal life now. I do understand that some people don't feel comfortable and I am not judging. Everyone needs to determine the risk they are willing to take.

Specifically that - 2 months would be the end of the world.  Just like an SD that supposedly can't provide a given allowance/ppm due \"cash flow issues\".  I wouldn't be sugaring - if I didn't have a year's worth of living expenses sitting on the sidelines.  .",

She received an allowance, car , apartment, health insurance and traveled with me on business.\n\nI was a lover , friend , and mentor.\n\n2008 comes and my liquidity dries up.\n\nWe had a long talk , and I told her. Things will have to change for a bit. You can keep the car and apartment until the lease is up. But the health insurance and allowance has to stop. \n\nI didn\u2019t expect intimacy from her at this point. But all I was asking for was emotional support during these tough times in my life.\n\nWell it didn\u2019t go well. \n\nEvery time we spoke she always had a problem, and now that I wasn\u2019t Financially able to solve them. She had to go because she is depressed.\n\nNever mind what I was going through.\n\nSo if the Op decides to continue supporting her during these tough times. I would suggest thinking of her as a long term commitment, because you are now sharing a life experience..\n\nBut remember after she has recovered, she owes you nothing.",

When cases went down during the summer, I decided it was OK to see my SB. When I was able to get vaccinated,  I did. So did my new SB. We are leading a relatively normal life now. I do understand that some people don't feel comfortable and I am not judging. Everyone needs to determine the risk they are willing to take. If you are vaccinated,  you shouldn't worry about anyone else. If that doesn't work for you, stay home. The world and life need to go on.",

Specifically that - 2 months would be the end of the world.  Just like an SD that supposedly can't provide a given allowance/ppm due \"cash flow issues\".  I wouldn't be sugaring - if I didn't have a year's worth of living expenses sitting on the sidelines.  .",

If you do not wish to keep the emphasis on 'transactional' but on emotional, would you answer still be the same?\n\nI notice that the SR has similarities to 19050s (and prior) power dynamics within a marriage where the man was the provider and the female essentially a servant who had to be grateful for being provided for. That view is still not outdated in many parts of the world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Sure they have less money, but that doesn\u2019t mean a SD owes money to someone just because he has more of it.\n\nThis is pretty much that outdated world view.

Things will have to change for a bit. You can keep the car and apartment until the lease is up. But the health insurance and allowance has to stop. \n\nI didn\u2019t expect intimacy from her at this point. But all I was asking for was emotional support during these tough times in my life.\n\nWell it didn\u2019t go well. \n\nEvery time we spoke she always had a problem, and now that I wasn\u2019t Financially able to solve them. She had to go because she is depressed.\n\nNever mind what I was going through.\n\nSo if the Op decides to continue supporting her during these tough times. I would suggest thinking of her as a long term commitment, because you are now sharing a life experience..\n\nBut remember after she has recovered, she owes you nothing.",
