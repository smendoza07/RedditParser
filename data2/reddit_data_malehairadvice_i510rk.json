Also taking a higher dose than 1mg has no more of a significant effect on preventing hair loss, 1mg of fin is for hair loss, 5mg is for prostate care. As you stopped taking it you have left yourself open for hair loss again - should've just stuck with it why waste 12 years of progress unless you were experiencing side effects?",

Also taking a higher dose than 1mg has no more of a significant effect on preventing hair loss, 1mg of fin is for hair loss, 5mg is for prostate care. As you stopped taking it you have left yourself open for hair loss again - should've just stuck with it why waste 12 years of progress unless you were experiencing side effects?",

As for me, after two years, I have had zero side effects besides increases levels of free testosterone, which is to be expected, and kinda a good thing. I really haven't felt any growth impacts on my beard either like I was worried about prior.  \n>  \n>For my hair, wow has it helped. My hairline crept forward maybe a centimeter or 2, nothing super noticeable, but what I and others really noticed is, after 2 years of fin, I have denser and healthier looking hair than I did when I was 21, or honestly 18 for that matter. At that point, my hair looked dead and thinning, and you could easily see my scalp under direct lighting. Now, it looks like the same hair I had as a kid, much healthier and denser, and no lost hair. On top of that, I rarely ever noticed hair strands on my pillows and hands after running them through my hair, which was the opposite of what was happening prior to finasteride.  \n>  \n>Overall, finasteride has been a huge win for me, and I don't know how you respond to it but I would get prescribed again in a heartbeat.\n\nHI how are you man? 26 y/old have a lovely head of hair, don't ever want to lose this majestical afro of mine, little bit of receding the past 3 years and a bald spot at the top of my head but my hair covers it mostly, not too bad, but noticable, i was wondering, are you JUST on FIN? because i was doing a lot of research lately and i want to take the FIN pills, u know, daily. and i'm not into the MINOXIDIL stuff, since that's something that can cause rashes, etc, and if u only use minxodil it's a temporary fix they say, anyways dude let me know and i'm happy you are experiencing success with your hair!",

You might want to check out the idea of \"fine tuning\" and just how precise many parameters within our universe must be for any of this to exist. \n\nPhysicists are having to make hypotheses about \"the multiverse\" as the only explanation for how we could exist, except there's less evidence of the multiverse than there is of God. \n\nI was a long time (almost 30 years) atheist, and it's only been in the last five or so years that I've been convinced through logical arguments. \n\nBelieve what you want, but don't be so blinded by ideology that you're unwilling to accept new information",
