Sasuke plays the rival archetype which is very common in Japanese culture, and that type of rivalry is also commonnly seen among siblings. Naruto and sasuke push each other to improve because neither wants to be surpassed by the other. Shikamaru plays a more supportive, friend type role, and he\u2019s much more of a team player than most in the Naruto universe. He pushes Naruto to improve in a completely different way, helping Naruto feel accepted and that he has a place in the village and his friends, and also making it clear to Naruto that both he and others had faith in him as a shinobi. Both sasuke and shikamaru could see Narutos strength when others couldn\u2019t, and they both pushed him to grow stronger in almost opposite ways. Sasuke provided him with motivation and a goal, and shikamaru provided support and and always spoke out to defend or commend Naruto whenever he could",

So she (and sasuke) was willing for him to give up at that point, all of them would forfeit, but have a chance later on to try again. \n\nIt's not sacrificing her whole career, but it would push them back.

Naruto wasn't handed very much until the end of Shippuden, Kurama notwithstanding. Sasuke had the Sharingan, Kakashi did too, Neji had the Byakugan, and all of the other kids had clan specific jutsu.\n\nBut Naruto clawed his way through a war torn world with his fists. He used Kurama's chakra sparingly, and it actually did more harm than good to have it because his chakra developed weird due to only having Yang Kurama, and for literally his entire life.",

Jiraiya said during both the Rasengan and Kuchiyose training that Naruto had to channel Kurama's chakra to brute force the jutsu into working. He had no Yin chakra, so he made up for that with sheer amount of Yang chakra. His control was also ass due to sheer volume. It made much more sense to just use chakra augmented taijutsu with a bunch of shadow clones to bum rush his opponents, than spend years trying to fix himself. It also made for better writing that Kishimoto didn't go that route, IMO.",

Sasuke plays the rival archetype which is very common in Japanese culture, and that type of rivalry is also commonnly seen among siblings. Naruto and sasuke push each other to improve because neither wants to be surpassed by the other. Shikamaru plays a more supportive, friend type role, and he\u2019s much more of a team player than most in the Naruto universe. He pushes Naruto to improve in a completely different way, helping Naruto feel accepted and that he has a place in the village and his friends, and also making it clear to Naruto that both he and others had faith in him as a shinobi. Both sasuke and shikamaru could see Narutos strength when others couldn\u2019t, and they both pushed him to grow stronger in almost opposite ways. Sasuke provided him with motivation and a goal, and shikamaru provided support and and always spoke out to defend or commend Naruto whenever he could",

He used Kurama's chakra sparingly, and it actually did more harm than good to have it because his chakra developed weird due to only having Yang Kurama, and for literally his entire life.",

Sasuke plays the rival archetype which is very common in Japanese culture, and that type of rivalry is also commonnly seen among siblings. Naruto and sasuke push each other to improve because neither wants to be surpassed by the other. Shikamaru plays a more supportive, friend type role, and he\u2019s much more of a team player than most in the Naruto universe. He pushes Naruto to improve in a completely different way, helping Naruto feel accepted and that he has a place in the village and his friends, and also making it clear to Naruto that both he and others had faith in him as a shinobi. Both sasuke and shikamaru could see Narutos strength when others couldn\u2019t, and they both pushed him to grow stronger in almost opposite ways. Sasuke provided him with motivation and a goal, and shikamaru provided support and and always spoke out to defend or commend Naruto whenever he could",

I think that and the fact that, for a long time, Naruto won his fights almost exclusively with shadow clones and taijutsu, are why Shikamaru respects him. Naruto wasn't handed very much until the end of Shippuden, Kurama notwithstanding. Sasuke had the Sharingan, Kakashi did too, Neji had the Byakugan, and all of the other kids had clan specific jutsu.\n\nBut Naruto clawed his way through a war torn world with his fists. He used Kurama's chakra sparingly, and it actually did more harm than good to have it because his chakra developed weird due to only having Yang Kurama, and for literally his entire life.",

Jiraiya said during both the Rasengan and Kuchiyose training that Naruto had to channel Kurama's chakra to brute force the jutsu into working. He had no Yin chakra, so he made up for that with sheer amount of Yang chakra. His control was also ass due to sheer volume. It made much more sense to just use chakra augmented taijutsu with a bunch of shadow clones to bum rush his opponents, than spend years trying to fix himself. It also made for better writing that Kishimoto didn't go that route, IMO.",

It made much more sense to just use chakra augmented taijutsu with a bunch of shadow clones to bum rush his opponents, than spend years trying to fix himself.

He had no Yin chakra, so he made up for that with sheer amount of Yang chakra. His control was also ass due to sheer volume. It made much more sense to just use chakra augmented taijutsu with a bunch of shadow clones to bum rush his opponents, than spend years trying to fix himself. It also made for better writing that Kishimoto didn't go that route, IMO.",
