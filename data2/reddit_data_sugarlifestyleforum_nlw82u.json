    "body": "I know this isn\u2019t rant and rave day, but I am cranky, so here goes.   Almost everyone I have met in this lifestyle, has had a troubled relationship with their Dad.  Including current SB who comes from a broken home.  Her Dad reneges on commitments over-and-over again.  It is tough to watch how this hurts her.  She tries to pretend it is no big deal, but I know her well enough to see the truth.\n\nThe two of them had really cool plans for tomorrow, and of course he cancelled.  She was so excited about the plan.  I found this out, because she asked me in the sweetest way possible, if we could spend time together tomorrow. I love seeing her,  but in this case I wish her jackass of a Dad would honor a damn commitment to her once in a while.  Even if it would mean me being on my own tomorrow.  \n\nTears me up to see her hurt over and over again.   I make it a point to NEVER let her down or back out of seeing her when we set something up.  The appreciation and affection I get back is something else.  \n\nDads - try to be great to your daughters!",

If I had to write a book about my life so far, 90% of it would cover how my dad destroyed any chance I had to be a normal person (think: emotional neglect and domestic violence, resulting in CPTSD). And I didn\u2019t realize how all that affected me until I started looking around at all the other fathers and daughters and wondered what I was missing. I\u2019ll be the first to say that I\u2019m bitter and envious because no matter how hard I try to fit the pieces together I will never have a healthy understanding of relationships. So take it from me: tell your daughter that you love her. And thank you for posting this.

A dear friend of a SB was super close with her dad.  Her dad was notably supportive of her friends, both male and female, and was good when she started sleeping with some of those friends.  Her dad was notably older than her mom, possibly one factor in my dear friend having a legit thing for older guys sometimes.  She also dated folks her own age.  She told me stories of the older guy she really should NOT have dated, and the older guy she wanted to bang but had stopped herself, etc.  We were close and shared most stories, she quite possibly heard every one of mine over time.\n\nNow, there was some complexity.  Her dad had a job where he was physically absent for long stretches of time.  Her mom was the train wreck, on the spectrum and a super high achiever in a couple areas who did one of the Classic Bad Things.  My dear friend has a notable hip to waist ratio, something I and others found objectively attractive.  My dear friend's mother, when she was twelve, began calling her \"fat\" and literally withholding food when her beloved dad was away.  That did a bit of a number on her.  She felt unattractive, and surprised when other men and women hit on her.  \n\nOn the core point, though, I agree whole heartedly!  If you have a kid, do the best you can by them.  Always.",

I think that has everything to do with her other admission that for years she was quite the hoe (whatever the reasons for that); and she now feels she has put that period behind her at age 25 next month. Over the course of her college career she was a recruited D One athlete and champion, supported very much by family including father. She started sugaring after breaking up with LT BF who didn\u2019t give her enough space and was cruel at times. As long as she was going to have sex in the future might as well get paid for it. She doesn\u2019t claim any history of fancying or dating older men, even if she may have fucked the occasional M +5-10 years older. I summed all this up as \u201cbeing sex positive\u201d, showing imho much more follow through and less inhibitions than women of prior generations, and being able to manage the insinuation that sugaring is sex work or prostitution by another name, and so to be shunned. Again, in my experience, didn\u2019t see daddy issues but thought this alternative best explained willingness of several young women to sleep with ~60 yo me. Another Ivy D One athlete, from a prominent CA family, wanted the sex and thrill of it, and spending money not from family, as opposed to a campus BF/time drain or a reputation for sex besmirching a well known family name. Third SB was another athlete from a \u201csmall Ivy\u201d and similarly normal family. Come to think of it, if I continue to sugar in future think I\u2019ll stick with college athletes or alumna!",

The LT one is darn close to dad, though she did miss him as a child while he was on military deployment in Asia for usual length. She was highly sexed since teenage years and super horny in college. So rather than daddy issues she is just very sex positive and, equally to the point, highly motivated to make money. She likes to be financially set to spend like the college peers \u201cwho never had to worry about expenses since parents bankrolled their every desire\u201d. She\u2019s quite normal coming from that comfortable but tighter middle of the middle class, with three children going to college.",

I think that has everything to do with her other admission that for years she was quite the hoe (whatever the reasons for that); and she now feels she has put that period behind her at age 25 next month. Over the course of her college career she was a recruited D One athlete and champion, supported very much by family including father. She started sugaring after breaking up with LT BF who didn\u2019t give her enough space and was cruel at times. As long as she was going to have sex in the future might as well get paid for it. She doesn\u2019t claim any history of fancying or dating older men, even if she may have fucked the occasional M +5-10 years older. I summed all this up as \u201cbeing sex positive\u201d, showing imho much more follow through and less inhibitions than women of prior generations, and being able to manage the insinuation that sugaring is sex work or prostitution by another name, and so to be shunned. Again, in my experience, didn\u2019t see daddy issues but thought this alternative best explained willingness of several young women to sleep with ~60 yo me. Another Ivy D One athlete, from a prominent CA family, wanted the sex and thrill of it, and spending money not from family, as opposed to a campus BF/time drain or a reputation for sex besmirching a well known family name. Third SB was another athlete from a \u201csmall Ivy\u201d and similarly normal family. Come to think of it, if I continue to sugar in future think I\u2019ll stick with college athletes or alumna!",

I think that has everything to do with her other admission that for years she was quite the hoe (whatever the reasons for that); and she now feels she has put that period behind her at age 25 next month. Over the course of her college career she was a recruited D One athlete and champion, supported very much by family including father. She started sugaring after breaking up with LT BF who didn\u2019t give her enough space and was cruel at times. As long as she was going to have sex in the future might as well get paid for it. She doesn\u2019t claim any history of fancying or dating older men, even if she may have fucked the occasional M +5-10 years older. I summed all this up as \u201cbeing sex positive\u201d, showing imho much more follow through and less inhibitions than women of prior generations, and being able to manage the insinuation that sugaring is sex work or prostitution by another name, and so to be shunned. Again, in my experience, didn\u2019t see daddy issues but thought this alternative best explained willingness of several young women to sleep with ~60 yo me. Another Ivy D One athlete, from a prominent CA family, wanted the sex and thrill of it, and spending money not from family, as opposed to a campus BF/time drain or a reputation for sex besmirching a well known family name. Third SB was another athlete from a \u201csmall Ivy\u201d and similarly normal family. Come to think of it, if I continue to sugar in future think I\u2019ll stick with college athletes or alumna!",

I think that has everything to do with her other admission that for years she was quite the hoe (whatever the reasons for that); and she now feels she has put that period behind her at age 25 next month. Over the course of her college career she was a recruited D One athlete and champion, supported very much by family including father. She started sugaring after breaking up with LT BF who didn\u2019t give her enough space and was cruel at times. As long as she was going to have sex in the future might as well get paid for it. She doesn\u2019t claim any history of fancying or dating older men, even if she may have fucked the occasional M +5-10 years older. I summed all this up as \u201cbeing sex positive\u201d, showing imho much more follow through and less inhibitions than women of prior generations, and being able to manage the insinuation that sugaring is sex work or prostitution by another name, and so to be shunned. Again, in my experience, didn\u2019t see daddy issues but thought this alternative best explained willingness of several young women to sleep with ~60 yo me. Another Ivy D One athlete, from a prominent CA family, wanted the sex and thrill of it, and spending money not from family, as opposed to a campus BF/time drain or a reputation for sex besmirching a well known family name. Third SB was another athlete from a \u201csmall Ivy\u201d and similarly normal family. Come to think of it, if I continue to sugar in future think I\u2019ll stick with college athletes or alumna!",
