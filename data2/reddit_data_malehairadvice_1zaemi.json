On a molecular level avocado oil actually penetrates the cuticle of your hair, while other oils sit on the surface just coating it. that means its harder for your natural oils to penetrate your hair if something is constantly coating the surface. if you want to get your hair straighter, use mousse on clean shampooed and conditioned hair. use a paddle brush to comb while blow drying. it might \"blow up\" getting big and fuzzy. but putting the wax on afterwards and then combing through how you want it should give you better results. and yes, put the oil on after heat, or use it as a conditioner in the shower. careful though to slip and break your neck and then blame me. I can't live with that kind of guilt.\n",

On a molecular level avocado oil actually penetrates the cuticle of your hair, while other oils sit on the surface just coating it. that means its harder for your natural oils to penetrate your hair if something is constantly coating the surface. if you want to get your hair straighter, use mousse on clean shampooed and conditioned hair. use a paddle brush to comb while blow drying. it might \"blow up\" getting big and fuzzy. but putting the wax on afterwards and then combing through how you want it should give you better results. and yes, put the oil on after heat, or use it as a conditioner in the shower. careful though to slip and break your neck and then blame me. I can't live with that kind of guilt.\n",
