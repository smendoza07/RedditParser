    "body": "AN SB CHRISTMAS STORY\ud83c\udf85\ud83c\udf84\ud83c\udf81\ud83c\udf87\ud83d\udc9d\n\nI read on the forum about the gifts you all are intending to exchange and I thought I should contribute my thoughts. I have never posted, but I really believe someone needs to hear this and can relate. I am sd-less for the past few years and just haven't found the energy to return to the bowl yet. I hope I will get back in the swing of things, because I miss it so much and I definitely could use the benefits. I kinda live vicariously thru all of you and stay well read on this forum! I love it!! \n\na few years back, I had an amazing arrangement with a gentlemen. Literally, the late preachers son-  he was in his late 50's and I my mid 20's. He invited me to their family church service and to the extravagant holiday dinner with the entire family. I felt out of place as they were all definitely higher class than I was, as a single mom from a very low income/class family. I remember being especially fascinated by the special silver dish that was meant to keep cold food cold and separate from your warm plate (lol) and the idea of having my place set with 2 forks. I was a long way from home to say the least. Without my manners and politeness, I would've failed the event horribly. \n\nAnyways, it came time to open gifts around this massive tree that belonged in a higher end mall or a hallmark movie for sure. I sat quietly, very much out of my element. He gifted me several bigger ticket items and his family barely took notice at all as they all were doing the same, tho Im sure they sensed the arrangement. It was my turn to gift him and I was embarrassed. I felt every eye in the room turn towards the corner where I had nestled in to be unseen for this moment. Im guessing they had assumed that I would only be on the receiving end  of our transactional relationship so obviously everyone in the room became interested to see what he was getting. I wanted to hide my face behind the mountain of ALL matching couch pillows that probably costed more than my car.\n\n That December was particularly rough, (like this one, but thats a story for another day) I was going thru eviction and barely making ends meet even with his help. My SD was a business man, always in a suit and tie. He had a real love for Jerry Garcia ties. (For the younger ones, he was a rock star \ud83c\udfb8 with the Grateful Dead band) These ties were aggressively loud and colorful. I have no idea WHY\ud83d\ude02, but he loved them. They were on the expensive end and after I researched, I came up with the idea that I could go to every thrift shop around the Detroit Metro area and search for every Jerry Garcia tie that I could find! \n\nSurprisingly my mission was super successful. I found many and even some of them that were rare and listed on ebay at exorbitant prices. My total probably was less than $20 altogether and that was great since it is probably all I had in my purse anyway. I was so very excited. I took them to the dry cleaners (my very first trip inside a place like that) and they all came back looking new and as close to perfect as possible. I wrapped them in tissue and boxed them in pretty paper with bows and waited impatiently for Christmas to come.\n\n Sitting there in that moment though in front of him, his very successful family, and that damn perfect hallmark tree...I felt so small. I wrapped them pretty, but obviously they were not original in their new packaging and I was second guessing everything. What an awful idea compared to what these people were gifting each other. I just wanted to run or like I said HIDE as to not make an entire scene...but I didnt.\n\n I looked him in his eyes apologetically and watched him open the 6 identical size boxes with zero element of surprise by the time he'd opened the first 3. I was sad and embarrassed and ashamed. He was happy and it seemed genuine, but maybe I was misreading him. I couldn't wait for this exchange to be finished and we could move on to the next perfectly planned event on our agenda. \n\nI knew this family was strong in their tradition and it came so natural for them. Meanwhile I picture my own family who couldn't finish preparing the Christmas meal before they were drinking, drugging, or fighting and then serving us from the pots and pans on paper plates before everyone went their separate ways to eat. It was so different. I was so different. \n\nI persevered thru the night and said my goodbyes to his amazing family on my way out. He helped me to my junky car with hands full of gifts to load. I thanked him profusely and drove away.\n\n I hadnt gotten far before the tears welled up in my eyes and burned down my cheeks. I pulled over at the first gas station to steady myself and consider whether I should change my phone number, block him, or go lay in bed for 3 days eating ice cream. I didnt know what to do or what I felt or even why. Eventually I get home and into my bed feeling sorry for myself and ashamed of my gifts.\n\n He deserved so much more and better, and I just did not have it to give and the foreseeable future wasnt looking any brighter. I just felt bad. It took me a few days to come to terms with it all. \n\nWhen I finally decided to face him and stop ignoring his texts and calls, I was so surprised to see that he was actually so grateful for my thoughtfulness in choosing his gifts. He had only mentioned his small infatuation in passing conversation a couple times thru the entire time we had known each other and was very impressed that I noticed, cared, and listened. He said that this was the very best Christmas he had had since his father passed away and thanked me about 1,000 times. He was so genuine in his appreciation that it made me believe he was being honest and sincere \u2764\ud83d\udc95\n\n He felt acknowledged and special! That was my entire intention behind the gift, so I guess in hindsight- I killed it! He loved them and everytime I saw him after that at work or a date night after work, he was wearing his crazy used ties. I couldn't believe it \u263a\ud83d\ude0d eventually we split up and things did not work out between us (but, thats also another story for another day \ud83d\ude12) \n\nANYWAYS, I SAID ALL THAT TO SAY THIS... IF ANY OF YOU ARE FEELING INSECURE ABOUT CHOOSING THE GIFT FOR YOUR SD, DONT!! LISTEN TO YOUR INTUITION AND PUT THOUGHT INTO YOUR GIFT, AND YOU WILL NOT GO WRONG. IT DOESNT MATTER IF YOU SPEND $5 OR $5,000, IF IT IS TRULY FROM YOUR HEART AND MEANINGFUL, THEY WILL LOVE IT. YOU MAY NOT FIT IN WHEREVER YOU END UP CELEBRATING, BUT MAYBE THAT IS WHY HE LOVES YOU. SHED THAT INSECURITY AND BE THE YOU THAT HE HAS COME TO APPRECIATE. BE GENUINE AND BE AUTHENTIC. MANNERS AND POLITENESS WILL EXCUSE YOUR AWKWARDNESS, I SWEAR!!! GO FOR IT AND ACCEPT THE INVITE\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf81\ud83c\udf84\ud83c\udf85 GIVE YOUR GIFT WITH YOUR HEAD HELD HIGH. SHOW YOUR APPRECIATION AND IT WILL COME BACK TO YOU MANY TIMES OVER. GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR HOLIDAY SEASON. I WISH THE BEST FOR YOU ALL!!\u2764\ud83d\udc95\u2764\ud83d\udc95 LOVE, NICOLE.",

It was CAMEO appearance by the girl who played Nellie Olsen on Little House on the the Prairie. (CAMEO for those who don\u2019t know is an app where you can pay celebrities/ reality tv stars/ politicians) to read a message, give a note, whatever. The costs vary depending on their demand. She gave the most amazing personalized message to him, put on her Nellie Olsen wig, did the voice. It was awesome. \n\nWe had a small gathering of friends outside for his birthday, and I cast the video she sent onto oir outdoor TV. He burst into tears, and posted it online to hundreds of people saying what an amazing gift that was. I never told him how much it actually cost, I would\u2019ve paid way more for the joy he got out of it. I tipped her well afterwards.  So it\u2019s SO MUCH MORE than money, gift giving is a recognition that you understand this persons soul. \n\nNot to make this a promo for Cameo for anything but damn that worked out well. Covid friendly too.",

I\u2019ve lost almost everything, due to the pandemic. I feel LOW. But, I\u2019ve always been able to hold it together and I\u2019ve had amazing experiences like yours in the past. I know I will, again. So will you. \n\nGifts from the heart are so beautiful. They\u2019re worth much more than the expensive, designer presents that were being exchanged all around you that night. This is a beautiful message written by a beautiful person. Hang in there, babe!!! You\u2019ll have an amazing life. It\u2019s coming.",

(CAMEO for those who don\u2019t know is an app where you can pay celebrities/ reality tv stars/ politicians) to read a message, give a note, whatever. The costs vary depending on their demand. She gave the most amazing personalized message to him, put on her Nellie Olsen wig, did the voice. It was awesome. \n\nWe had a small gathering of friends outside for his birthday, and I cast the video she sent onto oir outdoor TV. He burst into tears, and posted it online to hundreds of people saying what an amazing gift that was. I never told him how much it actually cost, I would\u2019ve paid way more for the joy he got out of it. I tipped her well afterwards.  So it\u2019s SO MUCH MORE than money, gift giving is a recognition that you understand this persons soul. \n\nNot to make this a promo for Cameo for anything but damn that worked out well. Covid friendly too.",
