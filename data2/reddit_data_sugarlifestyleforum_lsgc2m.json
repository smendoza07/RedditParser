    "body": "Have you noticed how SLF is full of rants against SA, which has deliberately shifted from a sugar site into a gift shop/onlyfans promo?  \nI just made the same rant, but instead of SLF I took it to the reps at Visa. I filed the dispute online, dispute reason: \"service not provided\" and wrote a few lines describing the problem. Few days later visa rep called and I repeated the same, told them this \"dating site\" is mostly fake members who want free stuff online and the site supports this behavior with their \"wishlist\" feature.   \nI also told them about SA's policy to \"never issue refunds for any reason\".   \nVisa then refunded my last payment to SA, the full 90 day subscription.\n\nSA can play with their terms of service all day long, but remember Visa also has terms of service.",

That seems to be the only thing that gets businesses like this to modify the way they treat their customers. VISA also might drop them altogether, which is an option if they generate too many chargebacks. VISA would send them a notice of their intent to do that if they don't straighten up. \n\nSo even if VISA sides with SA and you don't get your money back, it still gets counted as a chargeback to SA and goes against them. IOW, if they suspend your account for something you legitimately didn't do and they refuse to listen to you, you should still dispute the charge despite SA's policy of not issuing refunds.",

SA's terms of service are in direct conflict with major credit card companies' charge reversal policies.  It's a balancing act between staying in business and staying out of court over  [SESTA/FOSTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Enabling_Sex_Traffickers_Act)  violations.\n\nScrew their TOS.

They got into hot water and were forced out of business over allegations of facilitating sex trafficking, among other charges.

SA's terms of service are in direct conflict with major credit card companies' charge reversal policies.  It's a balancing act between staying in business and staying out of court over  [SESTA/FOSTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Enabling_Sex_Traffickers_Act)  violations.\n\nScrew their TOS.
