    "body": "I see a lot of questions asking, how to ask the barber for a certain cut. \n\nJust show the picture, simple as that.\n\nNot every cut has a specific name and you can rarely describe the cut to your barber, so they will know exactly what you want. \nSometimes you may even misunderstand what you're looking at and tell the barber to give you something completely different.\n\nTo avoid all the confusion and anxiety, just show the picture. It's normal, common and makes the work for your barber MUCH easier.\nWe just look at the picture, know EXACTLY what you want and how to do it and then we can give your our feedback (how it'll look on you, our suggestions etc.)\n\nTldr; show the picture\n \n\nEnjoy your next cut!",

I've seen so many posts about how this place sucks **because** all we do here is tell people to show the barber the picture. the fact is, most people who post here don't care about learning anything about their hair. \n\nMost people don't even know what their hair type is other than \"kinda thick and average\" or w/e. I don't know how barbers put up with this but bless you. \n\nI'm a novice, and this is my first time ever grow my hair out, and I already know that I have type 2B - 2C hair, that it grows around six inches per year, have created a routine, and know to use conditioner and a scrunch-out gel to combat frizz. if I wanted advice on a hairstyle, I know to actually post my face shape and to not use a blurry picture. \n\nThe issue isn't necessarily the people who post, but the requirements to post \u2013 there are none. If you have any guides on signs of hair loss, or terminology, or any guide you think would be useful feel free to send me a private message and I can be in contact with a mod. \nI will be asking others who are more knowledgeable than I am for guides as well.",
