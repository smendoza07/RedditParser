    "body": "Our 1 year anniversary is tomorrow and the rest of our lives together succeed after that.\n\nThe Impetus:\n\nAfter a lugubrious amount of time spent scrolling through men on SA, I finally came across him.\n\nHim\u2014 a well-dressed and incredibly handsome man in his late 50\u2019s with a bio that read like Shakespeare prose. I (25F) was smitten and favorited him immediately.\n\nHe reached out shortly with a clever message referencing something in my bio. We took off to a third-party messaging app and within 10-20 minutes of texting, we realized that a majority of our individual preferences towards music, art, food, and general approach to life had a wide, and ever-growing, overlap. Think Venn Diagram, but with a much larger shared median.\n\nCould this be a made match in heaven?\n\nNeedless to say... it was.\n\nWe had our first date 2 weeks after the initial messaging exchange and we never looked back.\n\nFor the first few dates, I would only stay for the evening; however, that quietly coalesced into staying over for the night... then for two days... then for the weekend... and then eventually for the whole week.\n\nOn the second month of seeing each other, I asked him over lamb chops and roasted vegetables to go exclusive with me\u2014 he told me if I hadn't asked it first, he was going to do it that weekend.\n\nMonth 3, he asked me to move in.\n\nMonth 3, I moved in.\n\nMonth 4, he offered me an opportunity to be employed at his firm, which by happenstance is the job of my dreams\u2014 I accepted and know make double my previous salary and have an incredible mentor 24/7. He carves out hours of the week to hold \"office hours\" with me, which serves as a window of opportunity to receive private tutoring from him\u2014 I can ask him any question or seek any guidance that is needed. He provides anecdotes, suggestions, and constructive lessons to help me transition from a great professional to a world-class professional. He has invested heavily into my career goals, paying for online classes, books, providing capital, and other ancillary resources to help set me up for success.\n\nCareer-wise, I have taken off like a rocket ship.\n\nMonth 5, we begin introducing each other to our inner circle and despite the generous age gap, it has gone incredibly well and our tribes have started to almagamate.\n\nOver the next few months preceding to our one year, we have visibly and intangibly made each other much better humans.\n\nHim, more level-headed, calm, patient, and empathetic.\n\nMe, more organized, well-managed, ambitious, and analytical.\n\nOn a high-level overview, we spend 99% of our time together. Our days are solemn and interspersed with quiet, beautiful but radiant moments of affection. We communicate, we discourse, we learn, we argue but we grow, we travel, we laugh, we go and we love together.\n\nWe just adopted 3 cats and plan for an engagement post-covid19.\n\nToday\u2014 I am writing this from a highset balcony in Hawaii overlooking sprawling flora which kisses a blue horizon.\n\nMy legs are on his lap and he doesn't know that I am writing about the moments and his greatness that has coalesced to this zenith.\n\nHappy 1 year anniversary to the love of my life.\n\ntl;dr: It can happen. You can find your life partner on SA.",

A 25 year age gap may not seem significant at the moment but I assure you that it will be in another 25 years from now.

The commenters on the language make compelling points... but they're not completely convincing by any means; I know many women in their twenties who love big words and write in such a style.  But more centrally, I *completely* disagree with the general cynicism expressed in response to it.\n\nCall me an incurable romantic or perhaps an incurable sucker (is there a difference?), but I don't find the potential evolution of SR->successful vanilla to be impossible or even so prohibitively improbable.  I've been reading this subreddit for a while and I believe this to be my first comment of any seriousness.  I have had several SRs that lasted for a year or two, kept their boundaries intact, provided exactly what they were supposed to for both parties, and ended at appropriate times:  with the SB going her own way- in a better place in life- and me going mine.   \n\nIn the midst of those have been two exceptions.  The first (28-year age-gap) took a romantic turn and led to a six-year relationship and an engagement that was only broken at the last moment for the sorts of reasons that could sink any relationship.  \n\nThe second is set in the present.   After an auspicious set of dates beginning nearly a year and a half ago, it was put on hold during the pandemic while we were quarantined in separate places, but since then it has exploded into something truly wonderful.  Who knows exactly where it will go, but I'm an optimist... and why not be?  Could it fall apart?  Sure.  But couldn't a regular vanilla marriage or relationship fall apart?  Could the cynics here describe it all as some sort of \"long con\"?  Again- couldn't many standard marriages or relationship also be described this way, if one really wanted to get that granular?  Personally, I don't really care how it's described.  I'm happy, she's happy, life doesn't last forever, and we're going to give it a big shot.  We're not together 99% of the time (nor would either of us want to be), but it's got to be a good 61%.  This one has a 32-year gap (55/23).  Big deal.  Oh- and both of us are still seeking around at the same time on SA- and we comment on each other's 'POTs' (sorry, but couldn't there be a more elegant acronym?... so clunky!) because we're a little crazy and we love being a little crazy.  \n\nI'm actually quite looking forward to the responses to *this* comment.  There isn't an untrue word in it.  Skeptics... have at it!",

A HUGE theme in SB success stories is us mentioning how this person put us at ease about our safety. It's something not all SDs even have cross their mind. But all women worry about it.

Also, prose itself basically means any writing that uses sentences and paragraphs and not metrical structure. So what is OP saying it was like? Even if it was just supposed to be written well, what was written well about it? I feel like that's a man trying and failing to figure out how to write what would be attractive to an SB about a SD's bio and just keeping it vague enough to fit.\n\nNot to mention OP's account was seemingly created today for this exact post- presumably because their own account would have made it obvious they were not a SB lol.

Also, prose itself basically means any writing that uses sentences and paragraphs and not metrical structure. So what is OP saying it was like? Even if it was just supposed to be written well, what was written well about it? I feel like that's a man trying and failing to figure out how to write what would be attractive to an SB about a SD's bio and just keeping it vague enough to fit.\n\nNot to mention OP's account was seemingly created today for this exact post- presumably because their own account would have made it obvious they were not a SB lol.
