You can watch it [here](https://youtu.be/rDsz6w7zD2k). Originally the show is started in episode 1, but due to LKS sudden schedule on his movie shooting, Haha and KJK won't disturb LKS in his schedule, and the actual 'Big Picture' show which stated and started in episode 64, the show that Haha, KJK, and their crew is recording LKS secretly for 6 months, and finally the watch the result with LKS. It shows how genuine the LKS and he's a very humble person, even Haha and KJK want to show it to the world.\n\nThey talk about many things about Running Man. How deep is his love for Running Man? He's very grateful to be a part of it because he learned many things from the Running Man team and crew. It also revealed why LKS rarely appear in other variety show, because he can't show the same persona with the person other than RM family. And the reason why he joined 'Busted!'? Other than because there's YJS in it, is that he wants to show his gratitude to Cho-PD (Cho Hyo-Jin who was the first RM PD) who was chosen to be the 'Busted!' PD, because he's playing a part in making LKS's name to be as big as what it is now, then LKS wants to be the cast of 'Busted!'.",
