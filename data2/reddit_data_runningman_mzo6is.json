    "body": "RM has been running for 11 years now and at one point I thought that they could run for another decade or so but with the news that was released today, reality is catching up to us, the runners, but especially to the members.\n\nI've tuned in to RM for a couple of years now. I watched my first episode during the period when I was preparing for the toughest exam of my life which was my licensure exam. I could safely say that RM got me through all the months of stress and sleepless nights. RM has been a comfort and stress reliever for me but I know the show means even more to some of us. \n\nIt's kind of a weird feeling you know; The RM members don't even know me but somehow I feel attached to them like as they were running all those years, I've been running with them and I'd bet a lot of us here feel the same way.\n\nNow, I would like to offer the highest form of appreciation to Lee Kwang soo. RM has given a lot to Kwang soo but Kwang soo has given everything for RM. Kwang soo doesn't even know the meaning of \"No\" in RM. \n\n*Wrestling match with Jihyo?\n\nKwang soo: I got this.\n\n*Eating food that's already been in So min's mouth?\n\nKwang soo: I got this.\n\n*Receives a mission to make a paper plane out of their take out containers but he only has banana and orange peels?\n\nKwang soo: I got this.\n\n*Gets in an accident and injures his foot that normally requires a month or two to recover?\n\nKwang soo: I got this (immediately returns in less than a month)\n\nWe've invaded his apartment, met his parents and we've watched him meet the love of his life. We've seen him in his underwear, his censored butt and many more embarrassing moments throughout his RM run. Yes, he's worn many bald caps, face paints, flour and icing on his face and he even dressed up as a tree, but still he gives 101% percent. Although he's never received one Daesang (Grand prize) for his 11 years of RM work, he has brought millions of laughter and smiles to runners around the globe.\n\nHe may be considered as RM's prince of betrayal but everybody knows that Kwang soo's loyalty will always be with RM. Yes that's a bit cheesy but the truth is sometimes cheesy.\n\nFor over 500 episodes, Kwang soo was always running around and chasing the prize on screen but seeing him always giving his everything, his 101%, in RM and his acting career, I'm happy and confident in saying that this time, success and happiness will be the ones chasing after him now . With all that said, together we shout his forever iconic \"ANDWAAAAAAAAAE\"\n\nEDIT: Reading the comments made me think how huge Kwang soo has contributed to the world of variety entertainment and also, our lives as viewers. I hope he knows how much we appreciate everything he did. Yes, RM is just a show but somehow Kwang soo and RM made life a little bit better you know. Mondays are universally hated but somehow Runners look forward to it because there's gonna be a new subbed RM episode. I can't imagine how the staff and other members must be feeling after being with him for 11 years. We have friends we met in high school or college who we're attached to, how much more a person that's been with you through a decade so now I kind of understand why I and a lot us are emotional. It's nice and comforting to read through the messages and comments of support and unforgettable moments with Kwang soo. To the man who doesn't have \"quit\" and \"give up\" in his vocabulary and to him who is the absolute definition of dedication, we give our highest respect and greatest salute.",
