    "body": "One of the most important things when it comes to sugaring is making sure that you are remaining safe.  I know from experience that sugaring can have a pretty steep learning curve when you\u2019re new, and so often I see SBs asking questions or telling stories where they\u2019re making enormous, blaring safety mistakes.  I was inspired by something I saw another SB post, so I figured why not put a little something together.\n\n\nSCAMS:\nIt feels like almost every day there is a new poster asking if a certain situation is legitimate or not.  Being able to recognize when something is amiss is critical to your success as an SB.\n-  If it seems too good to be true, it usually is.\n- If you have to ask if it\u2019s a scam, it\u2019s a scam.\n-  Anyone asking to send you a large amount of money prior to meeting you is not real and is most likely a scam.  I\u2019ve had guys send me a couple hundred dollars here and there for whatever reason, but anyone making crazy claims about thousands of dollars is definitely a scammer.  \n- Anyone asking you to do anything with iTunes gift cards or visa vanilla gift cards is a scammer.\n- Anyone asking to send you a check and have you send back the remaining amount is a scammer.\n- Anyone else for you bank account / log in info is a scammer.  Anyone asking for your payment app log in info (PayPal, cashapp, venmo, etc) is a scammer.  That information is *never* needed to send money.\n- Anyone asking to pay you at the end of the week/month is a scammer.  You\u2019ll spend that amount of time with them and never see the allowance that was promised.\n- In the beginning of an arrangement, cash is king.  PayPal, Venmo, and bank transfers can be reversed and you\u2019ll be left with nothing.  Once trust is built you can move to more convenient methods like these.\n\n\n\nThere are a few tips you should take before you get started to keep yourself safe.  Even if you\u2019ve already started sugaring, it\u2019s never too late to switch things up and start doing them in a better, safer way.\n-  Make sure you get a burner number.  I use google voice, but I know there are other options available.  There are people out there with less than perfect intentions, and so much information can be found about you from nothing but a simple search of your phone number.  I can\u2019t stress this point enough, it\u2019s so crucial.\n-  Invent a sugar person persona for yourself.  Make a throwaway email address that you only use for sugaring purposes.  Though it is not 100% necessary, a lot of SBs use a fake name for the first few dates.  Be careful with the information you share when you are first getting to know them (college, hometown, neighborhood, etc).  All those little pieces of information can be pieced together and used to find out more about you.  Obviously once you get to know them and you feel comfortable doing so, you can tell them your real information if you desire.\n- Make sure that any photos you use can not be reverse image searched.  These photos should not be present anywhere else on the internet.  Double check this by reverse searching your own images to be sure nothing comes up.  \n-  While this may come across as hypocritical to some, gather as much information as you can about him and do some searching. If he tells you he\u2019s a professor at X school, you can go to the school\u2019s faculty directory website and confirm that it\u2019s true.  Mr. Number and Spokeo are great tools for vetting.  \n- So many SBs don\u2019t do their due diligence when it comes to vetting their POTs.  This is *so* important.  You have no idea who this man is.  You need to protect yourself and information is your best weapon.  Reverse search all the photos on his profile and any additional ones he sends you.  Does anything come up?  Does it match what he says?  Search his email, name, and phone number.  If you are able to find out their real info, search for them on Facebook and see if their lifestyle reflects what they claim it to be.\n- While gathering as much information as you can is super helpful, a lot of men are married or have a need to be discreet.  Just because he doesn\u2019t tell you much about himself or is using a burner number or a fake name, doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019s hiding something negative. I will say that most men are way worse at OPSEC than they think they are, and I usually know exactly who they are when I go on the meet and greet.  Bottom line, knowing as much about them as you possibly can is great for peace of mind, but it\u2019s not an absolute necessity.\n\nRED-FLAGS BEFORE MEETING:\n-  Asks for nudes or suggestive photos.  Make sure your profile photos accurately depict what you look like.  Make sure you have a good variety of photos. Headshot, full body, candid, etc.  It is important to have at least one photo where they can really see your figure.  As long as you do this, there is literally zero reason for a POT to feel the need to ask for more photos and anyone who does is most likely a photo collector.  I include a photo of me in a form fitting dress, and a candid bikini shot.  If they\u2019re asking for more photos or nudes and you already have a multitude of full body photos on your profile, end the conversation and move on.  \n-  Diverts the conversation to sex talk.   No one wants constant sex questions.  It\u2019s tacky and crass.  Tell him you are not comfortable discussing your sex life with strangers, but that you are willing to possibly revisit the topic once you get to know one another better.  I give these guys one chance.  If they\u2019re apologetic and we move on, great.  If they\u2019re rude or continue pushing, I tell them we are not a match and move on.  Anyone who keeps guiding the conversation back towards sex is being very clear with what their intentions are.  Sugaring is so much more than just sex and money.  If you\u2019re looking for someone who actually values you as more than a vagina, these guys are not it.\n- Raunchy username.  You know what \u201cKittyPleaser69\u201d is there for.  These men are to be avoided as they are strictly looking for cut and dry pay for play scenarios.\n- Bad grammar.  So you\u2019re supposed to believe he\u2019s successful and wealthy when he can\u2019t even string two sentences together without spelling and grammar errors?  Pass.  \n-  Anyone who does not respect your boundaries.  Whether it be using a burner number, not wanting to give out very personal info, not wanting to host/go bareback.  Anyone who makes you feel bad about wanting to protect yourself is not someone you want to associate with.  Anyone who insists you trust them when they\u2019ve done nothing to earn it is bad news.  Pushing boundaries early will only lead to escalated behavior later on.  \n-  Insists on meeting the same night you first contact them.  Drinks at a hotel bar so he can get you loosened up and then try to take you to a room?  Hard pass.  Insist on lunch/dinner (some people will say coffee but that\u2019s not my thing at all) during more reasonable hours when you\u2019ve had some time to prepare and get to know each other a little more.  This will screen out a lot of the guys who are simply horny and looking for a one off.\n \n\n\nOnce you\u2019ve found a few POTs, the next step is to set up meet and greets to scope each other out, see if there\u2019s any chemistry, and possibly discuss a future arrangement.\n-  Meet and greets should begin and end in a public place.  There should be other people around and it should take place in a low stress environment.  \n-  Always make sure you can get to AND from a first meet.  NEVER LET HIM PICK YOU UP OR DRIVE YOU HOME.  You do not know this man, do not get into his car.  That sounds like an episode of criminal minds just waiting to happen.  Read through this sub a little bit and you\u2019ll hear multiple stories of SBs being groped in cars and put in uncomfortable situations.  This is so easily avoided.  Drive yourself, take an Uber, or take public transport.  No matter how convenient it is, do not let him give you a ride.  It doesn\u2019t matter how nice he seems, *you do not know this man yet.*  If you are traveling a good ways away to meet him, asking for travel costs to be reimbursed is very reasonable.\n-  Make sure someone knows where you\u2019re going and what time you\u2019re expected to be back.  Even if you don\u2019t have friends who know you sugar (although I definitely recommend you find one), you can just make it out to be a regular date.  Whenever I *do* get in his car for the first time, I always give a friend the make/model/license plate number.  Does this seem excessive?  Maybe.  But it could save your life and it\u2019s not going to hurt anyone.  \n-  Do not let yourself get too inebriated.  Some girls don\u2019t drink at all.  I personally like a drink now and then, but I make sure I *never* get drunk. It\u2019s messy and trashy and can impair your judgement and decision making skills.\n-  Meet and greets are usually uncompensated.  I think it is incredibly uncouth to ask to be paid to simply show up.  However as I mentioned above, if you are driving far or are required to spend money on parking/valet or public transport, I do think that it is fair to ask for reimbursement.  The meet and greet is simply to gauge chemistry and see if you guys are interested in possibly moving forward.  Neither of you owe each other anything at this point.  That being said, while I never ask to be compensated, it is not uncommon that an SD chooses to gift at the end of the meet and greet anyways.  It is always extremely appreciated and a very good sign.  \n- Take notice of the way he is dressed.  Is he clean, well groomed?  Does he look put together?  While it is in no way, shape, or form foolproof, a great way to identify a man of means is by his watch or his shoes.\n- Watch how he treats the staff.  Is he kind to the server/valet?  Does he treat them with respect?  Do the staff there know him?  Does he tip well?  These are all important signs.  I also like to be sneaky and get a peek at what type of card they have \ud83d\ude39\n\nMEET AND GREET RED FLAGS.  \n-  Constantly tries to move things to a more remote location.  You need to go into it with the mindset that there will be no intimacy at the meet and greet.  Drill that into your head.  There will be absolutely no sex on the first date.  Keeping the meet and greet platonic drastically reduces the chance of a pump and dump.  Even if you really hit it off, it\u2019s best to go home and think things over and come to an agreement to start the arrangement on another day.  \n-  Limits you on what you can order, complains about the prices of things, or cringes at the bill.  If he can\u2019t afford a meet and greet meal then he\u2019s cheap, or he can\u2019t afford you.  Neither option is good.  You shouldn\u2019t have to worry about prices or penny pinching when you\u2019re out with an SD.  \n-  Catching him in lies/ conflicting stories.  It\u2019s one thing to fudge the truth to protect your discretion, it\u2019s another thing to not be able to keep your lies straight.  \n-  Controlling/forceful behavior. If he\u2019s that pushy on the first date, he\u2019ll be even more worse on the next one or on the one after that because you\u2019re rewarding bad behavior.\n\n\n\nOnce you\u2019ve had a meet and greet and solidified the terms, you will set up a date to begin your arrangement.  \n-  For the love of god, please use a condom.  There are so many men out there trying to have raw sex with SBs.  If they\u2019re trying to go bare when you when they hardly even know you, they\u2019re doing it with other girls too.  Regardless of what he says, you are not that special.  Let that thought sink in.  He doesn\u2019t care about his sexual health, that\u2019s what he\u2019s really saying.  Guys will have a million and one excuses not to wear one.  Send them packing every time.  There are plenty of SDs who are more than happy to have safe sex than to put up with someone who\u2019s going to bitch and moan about it every time.\n- While some may disagree, the overall consensus is that the first intimate meet should take place at a hotel.  It is a neutral location with a lot of witnesses nearby.  It\u2019s sad that\u2019s the way we have to think about things, but it is what it is.  Plus room service and spas are always fun.  I personally love hotels, they make me feel fancy as fuck.  Take note of what type of hotel he books.  It doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be the Ritz, but it shouldn\u2019t be a motel.  It should be on the nicer side and clean.  A few times my SD has to be somewhere so he leaves and I get to keep the room, which is always a blast.  Who doesn\u2019t love huge comfy beds, beautiful bathrooms, and more room service.  \n- You should receive your allowance prior to engaging in any intimacy, especially if it is your first few times being intimate.  This non negotiable.  It doesn\u2019t have to be made into a big deal and it\u2019s only ever transactional if you make it that way.  I\u2019ve had SDs put my allowance in greeting cards, which I think is a super cute idea.  Sometimes they just slipped it on the counter/into my bag and excused themselves to the bathroom so I could count if I wanted to.  If someone gets upset about it, gives you a hard time about giving you your allowance prior to intimacy, or hits you with a million excuses, I suggest you walk out.  If he cares about your comfort level, he should want you to have that peace of mind so you can relax and enjoy your time together.  In my opinion, it\u2019s the SDs job to bring up allowance and give it to you in an inconspicuous manner.  If he doesn\u2019t, do *not* feel weird bringing it up.  \u201cDo you have something for me?\u201d, \u201cCan get my allowance out of the way so we can get to the fun part?\u201d are all ways you can bring it up.  If it\u2019s your first time together, I suggest you make sure it\u2019s all there.  You may feel awkward having to ask for your allowance, but you\u2019ll feel a lot worse walking out empty handed and pumped and dumped.  This sub is rife with pump and dump stories, if you care to take a look.\n\nMORE RED FLAGS \n-  Misses/is late with allowance.  If you are on a PPM system *always get the money prior to intimacy* in the beginning.  There are no I forgots/I\u2019ll pay you after/tomorrow/etc.  It doesn\u2019t matter what the excuse is.  If you are on a monthly allowance and he has yet to send the allowance, he needs to send it to you prior to your next meet otherwise he is breaking the terms of the arrangement.   Never let anyone make you feel bad about asking for your allowance because they sure as hell aren\u2019t shy about expecting intimacy.  Never let him get so comfortable that thinks he can beat around the bush about the financial component.  At the end of the day it is and always will be an arrangement.\n-  Pushes for things you have expressed discomfort with.  Going condomless, anal, whatever it may be.  Never do anything you don\u2019t feel good about and make sure you let him know your feelings in no uncertain terms.  Anyone who is being pushy about certain things in bed does not care about you or your feelings. \n\n\n\nOut of everything I\u2019ve mentioned above, the last thing I want to touch on is probably the most important of all.  Do not ever under any circumstances let the idea of money take precedent over your well being.  If you take nothing else away from this entire thing, let it be this.  Your health and safety is so important.  There will always be more money, there are certain other things you can\u2019t get back.  \n",

            "body": "This is brilliant, thanks so much.  As a corollary, I feel that my job as a SD is to make sure that she never has to ask an awkward question or bring up a subject that feels awkward.  Before a first M&G, I'll say: There are some safety rules that I follow, here they are.  I don't mean to be rude but I am not going to offer to pick you up because it's a safety rule that we should arrive separately.  I discuss allowance (when it feels comfortable) before she brings it up.  I give her the allowance before we go anywhere private.  I ask if she has any questions and if she feels comfortable.  If I'm being a good SD, I should be attending to all these things so that she never has to make the effort to raise an awkward subject.  Of course talk can go to sexual but I don't harp on it. Later on in our conversation, I might say \"I hope this isn't offensive, but I want to say that I am looking for someone who is sex positive and really enjoys it.\"  That's as far as I would go.  At the moment of the first cash handover, I say \"This is a gift which doesn't obligate you to do anything particular.\"  I just try to think about what would feel comfortable/ uncomfortable for her, and to do and say things that make the uncomfortable pieces go away.",

In a moment of stupidity some years ago I tracked some of the time that it took to find a replacement SB  when one moved away, it was somewhere between 3-8 months allowance, mostly due to my trying to find and recruit from too many prospects plus loosing some prospects where we had an unconsummated arrangement. \n\nWhile the economics are significant I think the major change is in the dynamics of the first intimacy.

While I understand an appreciate the need to ensure you're not scammed out of intimacy for no money, I also feel like if at that stage you're unsure he will pony up, then you haven't done your vetting like you should have. If you've followed every piece of advice up to that point, I think you can be confident he's not going to then suddenly pull the rug out from under you.\n\nOn the other hand, if you didn't follow everything to the letter, and you instead met him same day at a hotel, then you absolutely should insist on the money upfront.  \n\nBottom line is, if you're unsure, then keep vetting him.\n\n&#x200B;",

Just as in business some clients want to work with you as a trusted partner and others are constantly looking for ways to get freebies. \n\nBecause of the nature of the work I do, searching for a replacement SB costs money.  In a moment of stupidity some years ago I tracked some of the time that it took to find a replacement SB  when one moved away, it was somewhere between 3-8 months allowance, mostly due to my trying to find and recruit from too many prospects plus loosing some prospects where we had an unconsummated arrangement. \n\nWhile the economics are significant I think the major change is in the dynamics of the first intimacy.   The first generally has a significant impact on the future.  \n\nThere's no right or wrong answer , the important thing is that it is consistent with your mission objectives, strategy and the envelope in which you want to operate.  \n\n\n\n ",

In a moment of stupidity some years ago I tracked some of the time that it took to find a replacement SB  when one moved away, it was somewhere between 3-8 months allowance, mostly due to my trying to find and recruit from too many prospects plus loosing some prospects where we had an unconsummated arrangement. \n\nWhile the economics are significant I think the major change is in the dynamics of the first intimacy.
