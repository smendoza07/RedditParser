Swipe right for for the convo.\n\nEdit: To make this clearer, he observed afar and decided to run away\n\nEdit2: Summary here, we have to wear a mask outside otherwise the government fines HARD. So what he saw was what you see in the pic below, from a distance, nothing to do with my face. \n\n\nSomeone below pointed out that it might be a newbie lack of courage overall, not because of the bag or outfit, it's possible too. Or just being played & flaked \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44.",

Its a flat out classic imo. Calling that trash fashion is just plain ignorant imo.\n\nSomething to keep in mind is escorts tend to dress very well. Between the heels and that outfit in general you were not giving off a girl next door vibe, that same outfit without the heels, maybe even wearing sandals would have given off a very different image.",

Its a flat out classic imo. Calling that trash fashion is just plain ignorant imo.\n\nSomething to keep in mind is escorts tend to dress very well. Between the heels and that outfit in general you were not giving off a girl next door vibe, that same outfit without the heels, maybe even wearing sandals would have given off a very different image.",
