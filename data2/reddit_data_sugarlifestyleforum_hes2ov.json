    "body": "Oh my gosh- the Salt Daddies are out in force lately. \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m having such a tough time finding the right girl. I mean, I\u2019d like an intelligent girl who is always perfectly dressed and done up. She should swallow. She should be cool to cook for me at my house. No vetting allowed! No time limits of course. Booooo clock watchers. \n\nPPM? Ohhhh mmmm how about the same rate as a very low end escort charges for 2 hours.\u201d\n\n\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\n\nOn a positive note: my shopping package came in and so I have two cute new dresses to wear on my two M&G this week.",

He had SO many questions. \n\nI think he was more interested in talking about it online than actually leaving his house and doing the deed!",

Would it matter?\u201d*\n\nAll those who I\u2019ve run into online, who don\u2019t offer allowance or PPM have not included the word Salt or Splenda. In fact, usually they\u2019re saying things like \u201cready to spoil you\u201d or \u201cgenerous\u201d. I guess we all have different versions of what spoiling means, though. \n\nI absolutely wish they would list this in the profile. Thing is- does anyone really like to admit that they\u2019re on the low rent end of something? Not many people are comfy with that. \u201cHey I\u2019m not your typical Sugar Daddy, as i can\u2019t pay you a PPM equivalent to what you would make serving dinner at AverageSteakhouse, but hey, take Friday off work to go out with me anyways!!\u201d\n\nIf a Daddy isn\u2019t willing to do PPM or allowance, I wish he would be upfront about saying that on Seeking. I recently encountered one fine gentleman. Very cultured and charming. Great profile pics clearly indicating significant wealth, or him being in the company of wealth and being comfortable. Examples: him on yacht wearing LV loafers, with crystal blue seas to the horizons, gold Rolex; him in the backseat of a Phantom, him at a very luxe looking tropical resort. \n\nChatted me up over 10 days. Finally tells me he doesn\u2019t do PPM or allowance, no sugar at all except \u201coccasionally we will go shopping together\u201d. He \u201cdoesn\u2019t want someone who wants him for his wallet\u201d. Yet he\u2019s on a site where people go to gain companionship and sex in exchange for money...\n\nAnother man who represented himself as a Daddy \u201cwho wanted to spoil me rotten\u201d told me he would take me for a weekend getaway to a 3 star hotel the next town over. The room had a late 80s \u201cjacuzzi bath\u201d and he would buy us  room service. I told him that hotel doesn\u2019t offer room service and he laughed and said \u201coh I mean takeout, but delivered\u201d. When I asked about allowance for the weekend, he said that staying in with him for two days straight, and \u201cmy prodigious cunnilingus skills\u201d were my benefit. This all from a man who asked to meet me at a mall and offered me a smoothie date LOL\n\n\nI think for me- if I was a male who was attracted to being a Daddy, but I wasn\u2019t comfortable giving PPM or allowance, I would just be explicit about it. To me it would be a waste of time wading through all the women who wanted allowance, to find the ones who were okay without one. Likewise, I find it a waste of my time when someone is on a Daddy site and they don\u2019t seem to want to spend more 1k annually, but expect all the benefits. \n\nI\u2019d say something like this: \n\u201cI\u2019m not able to offer an allowance or PPM, but I do promise to treat you to wonderful dinners, take you out on fun excursions such as __________ cover your expenses, and of course, I would offer thoughtful and high end presents for special occasions including yoir birthday, Valentines Day, and Christmas\u201d \n\nThen, at least, she would know what she was getting in to!",

I can at least understand where @HwdSD is coming from and trace the logic. This is an uncomfortable conversation in some ways because it assumes that women are a commodity- at the end of the day, that is the case in some ways, particularly when you are in the browsing SA stage. \n\nI can say that my car is worth 50,000 to me because I really like it, but it\u2019s actually only worth what someone else is willing to pay. I learned this from running a business reselling antiques. People\u2019s heirlooms are priceless to them but worthless to everyone else. When we are attached to something we put a higher value on it than someone else would. Naturally, we love ourselves, and the value we place on our time, personality, appearance could very well be more than someone else would. \n\nI\u2019ve made posts in the past asking SBs to rate themselves- this is to try to get to the essence of this \u201cwhat are you worth\u201d question. If you knew where you fall on the spectrum in your area in terms of looks and personality, you could know what price you can command. We need an algorithm for this!

They are not a commodity, but most SDs are not financially well-off to the point where spending 4x PPM a month and spending 12 x PPM a month is an inconsequential decision.    It is entirely possible that an SD really values a particular SB a lot, but she wants 12x PPM, and he will instead choose to date someone who he doesn't like but is accepting of 4x a month.   That doesn't mean SBs are a commodity, it just means his overall happiness is hiring spending 4x a month and dating SB2 than it would be spending 12x a month and dating SB1.",

One other angle, if you don't mind: what I'm trying to accomplish is 3 things: filter out the pros (and not waste their time), filter for the noobs, and avoid negotiating $. \n\nI'm seriously pretty good looking, so if my profile was basically \"adulting through a pandemic like a warlord and having a lot of fun with it\" (playing drums, doing BJJ, cooking yummy food, etc.) Hustlers would see right though that, right? \n\nI'm looking for noobs who are bored.

You\u2019re entitled to your opinion, as other people who believe differently are entitled to their opinion. \n\nLet me say this about my position about sugaring as sex work: If your \u201cgift\u201d of money is conditional upon receiving sex, then it seems to me that she\u2019s a type of sex worker, and a Daddy is a type of client, and there\u2019s no shame in that! \n\nBut if there\u2019s no money if there\u2019s no honey...then what else could you call it? \n\nEvery man here is *very* quick to state that no Daddy will do platonic. He must receive sex or else there\u2019s no PPM or allowance, right? So then, how can these men het touchy about being referred to as a client? \n\nThey also get touchy about the semantics surrounding money exchanging hands! \u201cI\u2019m not *paying* her! I\u2019m *gifting* her!!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not money for sex. It\u2019s me enjoying spoiling her\u201d. Yet 99% of these men wouldn\u2019t be giving gifts or spoiling unless the sex was there...\n\nI get that that sex work is stigmatized and it\u2019s not pretty to think that money generally has to be there for the girl to hang out with you and have sex with you. But, when you boil it all down, and remove all the euphemisms and fluff, we\u2019re talking about a woman being incentivized by money to do something she wouldn\u2019t likely seek out of her own volition. \n\nMaybe that stings the heart of the average Daddy, but, how is there any other way to see it?",

Its important to respect how much time the other person wants to devote to the arrangement and other things they have going on in their life, but I'm not looking for someone who views our meetings as putting in X hours per date to get paid. If they don't genuinely enjoy spending time with me its not going to work. We should both enjoy our time together and be disappointed when that time has to come to an end because of the other things we have going on in our lives. I would also be very hesitant to provide any personally identifiable info to a POT before meeting. \n\nIts easy enough to find a beautiful woman who is willing to provide intimacy with a time limit for 2-3 times a standard PPM, subject to screening. That's called an escort and its not what I'm looking for on SA. There's nothing wrong with boundaries and expectations but applying sex work standards to sugaring is as bad as applying vanilla standards to sugaring.",

                            "body": "Here's the problem with your logic...\n\nEscorts are sex workers. This is their profession. They are highly skilled, and usually reviewed, you know what you're getting into, and most men are going to see them for their primary purpose, to get them off. Most aren't looking to date them, most aren't looking to go to dinner with them.   \n\nEscorts whether they are low end, mid end or high end, are all appealing to a retail customer. When selling something retail, you sell it at the maximum price. Retail customers don't get volume discounts and generally have to pay full price. If you want to equate being a SB to being an escort, then think of a SB as someone who supplies a wholesaler, not someone that sells retail. The SD is getting large blocks of her time each month, versus buying her time by the hour like the end user would with an escort. \n\nEscorts that work for an agency might give half to the agency. If they're a mid level escort and see 3 clients per day, they will only make what the average PPM is for most areas. They may have had to invest 5-6 hours of their time including all the showers and getting ready between dates, and the travel to and from the hotel.\n\nEscorts that are independent pay for their own advertising, hotels, travel, gas, and food, which all comes out of that hourly rate. Where as a SB has none of these expenses, her SD pays for them as part of their arrangement. Think of it like a Benefit package, that an escort doesnt have. Sort of like going for a new job, and they offer 2x per hour, and another offers 15, but there is a huge benefit package that includes holiday pay, health insurance, vacations, and travel expense. The escort is the one with the higher hourly, where as the SB is the one who gets less, but has a ton of other perks. The SD is the one incurring all the expenses of the arrangement versus an escort who has to either pay those expenses herself or her agency does.\n\nSB are not professionals. This was never about being a job, or being a side hustle, regardless of what social media has taught women these days. Wealthy men have dated younger women for aeons, and have helped them financially or spoiled them in exchange. Women have dated these men because they wanted to, not because it was their job, or because they were providing a service like a sex worker.\n\nUnfortunately because of Seeking and social media, there is hybrid NSA sugar arrangement that is something more akin to sex work, but this is not the true nature of a sugar relationship. Yes there are guys on SA looking for escorts, and yes, some are even looking for arrangements, but the truth is, that is not really a sugar relationship in the truest sense, and is closer to a form sex work. Thus why many on SLF argue that sugar relationships are sex work and that SB are sex workers. It's because these people are engaging in a stripped down version of a sugar relationship, that focuses on just the sex and the money. \n\nSB is not an escort, nor is she a sex worker, so you cannot compare the hourly rates of a professional doing her job, to someone in a relationship that is getting financial help and other forms of spoiling.",

Lots of people on SA are Johns/PUAs looking for a quick one with escorts and escort type material.  Lots of people are also escorts or both escort and SB.  It's blurry.\n\nRecognizing the spectrum, I think the real issue is that many of the real SDs here (and I do mean real SDs, there are some here that I dont want to comment on or be associated with) are trying to uphold a particular standard for SRs--traditional/modern SR that borders on SBF/SGF.  Not all of them certainly, but there are a number of us and we're pretty vocal.  We call out other SDs for what we think is improper behavior too.\n\nIf we don't try to uphold any standard, I could see the bowl collapsing in on itself and then we're left with a couple of outcomes:\n\n\\- SDs who want something NSA turn to escorts and hookups on Tinder\n\n\\- SDs who want something more traditional turn to more vanilla apps and have more vanilla affairs\n\nIt's hard to preserve that middle ground, but some of us are trying.  I'd like to think thats what SLF is for because there are guidelines here around what is/isnt an arrangement/SR.",

You aren't a provider, what you are describing is a sugar relationship. A provider would not care about any of the above, right? If he was looking for and treating you like a provider and expecting to pay you much less than a provider would be paid, because he met you on an SR site, I agree he's a cheap John not an SD. But a guy who is looking for an SR and who enriches your life and you enjoy dating is probably not going to be looking for an arrangement with similar economics to seeing a provider either. Because providers are paid *a lot* of money to overlook a complete lack of mutual attraction and most clients see providers occasionally, not overnight 4 times a month. Most SDs aren't pulling down well into the 7 figures that would be needed to support that kind of rate and frequency anyway. It doesn't make you salt to not be in the top 1% of 1% of SA.\n\nIt sounds like you have a current SR and if you're happy and getting what you are looking for financially, then I'm happy for you.",

How would they even charge you, especially if you only talk numbers in person? How would that be any different than me giving my vanilla girlfriend cash? You simply don't hear about SBs getting charged with prostitution.\n\n\"Sure my volume would be lower, but my risks would be higher!\"\n\nThat's not how risk works. Volume of partners is the number one determinant of STD risk. \n\n\"Mentorship isn't a thing for me.\"/\"Real connection is wonderful, but not all SB want or need it.\"\n\nSounds like you don't actually want many aspects of a sugar relationship. No wonder you don't get why the cash cost is lower.\n\n\"physical safety - this one is laughable to for me\"\n\nOf course there is still physical risk. But if you are screening properly pre and during the M&G, then you should hopefully only have to take that risk a few times a year, not multiple times a week, with someone whom you have screened relatively well. The risk is FAR lower, and you can't argue that.",

I don\u2019t have to state PPM in writing to be saying what I\u2019m saying.\n\nAnd screening well is *really* difficult as most Daddies will only screen for an escort.\n\nYour vanilla gf doesn\u2019t say \u201cdaddy, I\u2019m happy with $XXX per date\u201d.  SB do say these sorts of thing.  Daddies typically ask \u201cand we can include intimacy on each dates?\u201d And I reply yes, and then it\u2019s out there.  \n\nI can call is ### roses or #### donation for my business, but the intent is there and everyone knows what we\u2019re both talking about.  Then LEO can peg me for prostitution. I don\u2019t know the stats but with FOSTA SESTA being the new thing, SB are definitely at risk! \n\n\nAre you kidding me about STI risk? If I have unprotected sex with one SD who has HIV, how is my risk is lower than having multiple partners who wear protection? \n\nHow am I not a \u201creal SB\u201d because I don\u2019t seek mentorship? Does every man have a complex with wanting to be oh so smart and valued for his opinion? I work in a very very niche field. Very very few Daddies would be able to give me solid advice. I\u2019m not fake because I\u2019m savvy enough to know that. \n\nAs for emotional connection- I didn\u2019t say I didn\u2019t want it. In fact I do. I said not all SB want it, because not all do. \n\nAs for physical risk- I can argue whatever I want lol. Stating your opinion and saying I can\u2019t argue it is hilarious. Nonetheless, I do tend to agree with your point, haha. But honestly, to say that I can\u2019t argue it? That\u2019s a bit much \ud83d\ude02\n\nLet\u2019s discuss it though- screening is hard because most men won\u2019t screen for us. Sure we meet less guys than an escort but most SD will expect intimacy on a second date, yet the woman won\u2019t know his full name. She can\u2019t google if he\u2019s a criminal. She can\u2019t see if his story checks out. She\u2019s known him for some texting and for a first date, and then boom she\u2019s behind closed doors with him. \n\nSure the risk is less than someone who sees 5 guys a day, but the risk is still there and it\u2019s still terrifying. It only takes one guy to act lovely for some text and a first date, and then rape or kill you on that second date, after he refused to screen, because he\u2019s not a John. And you can\u2019t argue that ;)\n\nOverall though- why are you so dead set on telling me that I should be less concerned about my safety? I know most men are lovely kind people who just want a nice beautiful companion and some great sex, but some are not! \n\nI\u2019m entitled to be as nervous or concerned about my safety as I want to be. Is it a \u201cyou should be less afraid of me, so I can give you less?\u201d.",

As many, including me, have pointed out, there are many good reasons the market has landed where it has. You do not LIKE these reasons, but they exist and they are obviously valid. Because if they were not valid, the market would have landed on a higher price. \n\nYou might think that apples are worth $10 dollars each. You might believe it with all your heart. But if everyone else pays 33 cents for an apple, then an apple is worth 33 cents. \n\nYou may believe that sugar relationships are worth 3x PPM. But on average, everyone else is paying 1x PPM for them. So they are worth 1x PPM. You can rail against this all you want, but you will be just as unsuccessful as everyone else in history who has tried to fight market forces.\n\nIf the market suddenly started pricing SRs at 2x PPM, then any SD who could not pay that would be priced out. Similarly, if an SB requires 2x PPM but the market rate is 1x PPM, the SB will probably have a much harder time finding SDs, or will be a very high value SB for one reason or another.

And an SB who views me as a walking ATM and thinks in terms of dollars per hour is no different to me than an SD who views his SB as a sex doll. We are not ATMs and sex dolls. Nor are we client and provider. We are human beings looking for some form of romantic relationship that includes financial support. An SB shouldn't be expected to be perfectly made up and sexually available at an SDs whim when they are together, like an escort would be. An SD isn't going to want to pay by the hour or feel like they are on the clock, like a john would be. That doesn't mean platonic on the one hand and vanilla on the other, it simply means sugar is a distinct thing in the middle of the spectrum between those two extremes and you can't usually apply escorting or vanilla standards to sugar dating. \n\nObviously you're free to disagree with me, but I don't see the need to be insulting and dismissive.",

It is her job, its nothing more or less than that, and she will charge what will make it worthwhile to have sex with total strangers many of whom she is completely repulsed by. There is no expectation that a client will make conversation for days ahead of time and schedule a platonic M&G to make sure there's mutual attraction. There is no expectation that a client will provide gifts or dinners. There is no expectation of emotional support from a client. That is all a non-factor. The rates and screening protocols in the US are also much higher due to law enforcement risks that do not exist in sugaring. \n\nIf I understand your logic a vanilla relationship would be even more 'disgraceful' because there is even more emotional connection and less allowance. I just don't see it that way. The emotional connection and attention is a two way street. I'm offering something within my budget that I view as generous and know is in line with what others are offering and accepting in my city. I'm looking for something that is almost identical to casual or serious vanilla dating PLUS a significant amount of direct financial support. That seems like a good deal to me and a lot different from an escort/client relationship. Anyone who isn't happy with that is free to keep looking, no hard feelings, but hardly seems like 'salt' to me.",

The money just helps bridge the gap in terms of age, availability (as lots of SDs are married), etc.\n\nIf you want to maximise profit, that\u2019s fine, there\u2019s no rulebook on how to do this, but there are people with also legitimate relationships that will have a different, equally valid, point of view.\n\nFWIW my usual SBs would not be comfortable getting paid escort rates as that conveys a set of expectations they are not ready to fulfil.",

Of course you have to like someone, to some degree, to want to spend time with them. I do believe, however, that the money is a primary motivating factor for nearly every SB out there. \n\nSure your advice can be helpful, and it\u2019s nice when you provide emotional support, but would she stay with you if you stopped taking her out to fabulous places, stopped spoiling her, and stopped offering her an allowance or PPM? Let\u2019s keep it real, Daddy! \n\nLikewise, would you continue to offer any form of support if she told you that as of July 1st she will no longer be offering any form of sex- no BJ, no intercourse, nothing??\n\nFWIW, I\u2019m fairly certain your usual SBs would be just fine if you continued on as you always have, but you just started giving them way more money.",

Would it matter?\u201d*\n\nAll those who I\u2019ve run into online, who don\u2019t offer allowance or PPM have not included the word Salt or Splenda. In fact, usually they\u2019re saying things like \u201cready to spoil you\u201d or \u201cgenerous\u201d. I guess we all have different versions of what spoiling means, though. \n\nI absolutely wish they would list this in the profile. Thing is- does anyone really like to admit that they\u2019re on the low rent end of something? Not many people are comfy with that. \u201cHey I\u2019m not your typical Sugar Daddy, as i can\u2019t pay you a PPM equivalent to what you would make serving dinner at AverageSteakhouse, but hey, take Friday off work to go out with me anyways!!\u201d\n\nIf a Daddy isn\u2019t willing to do PPM or allowance, I wish he would be upfront about saying that on Seeking. I recently encountered one fine gentleman. Very cultured and charming. Great profile pics clearly indicating significant wealth, or him being in the company of wealth and being comfortable. Examples: him on yacht wearing LV loafers, with crystal blue seas to the horizons, gold Rolex; him in the backseat of a Phantom, him at a very luxe looking tropical resort. \n\nChatted me up over 10 days. Finally tells me he doesn\u2019t do PPM or allowance, no sugar at all except \u201coccasionally we will go shopping together\u201d. He \u201cdoesn\u2019t want someone who wants him for his wallet\u201d. Yet he\u2019s on a site where people go to gain companionship and sex in exchange for money...\n\nAnother man who represented himself as a Daddy \u201cwho wanted to spoil me rotten\u201d told me he would take me for a weekend getaway to a 3 star hotel the next town over. The room had a late 80s \u201cjacuzzi bath\u201d and he would buy us  room service. I told him that hotel doesn\u2019t offer room service and he laughed and said \u201coh I mean takeout, but delivered\u201d. When I asked about allowance for the weekend, he said that staying in with him for two days straight, and \u201cmy prodigious cunnilingus skills\u201d were my benefit. This all from a man who asked to meet me at a mall and offered me a smoothie date LOL\n\n\nI think for me- if I was a male who was attracted to being a Daddy, but I wasn\u2019t comfortable giving PPM or allowance, I would just be explicit about it. To me it would be a waste of time wading through all the women who wanted allowance, to find the ones who were okay without one. Likewise, I find it a waste of my time when someone is on a Daddy site and they don\u2019t seem to want to spend more 1k annually, but expect all the benefits. \n\nI\u2019d say something like this: \n\u201cI\u2019m not able to offer an allowance or PPM, but I do promise to treat you to wonderful dinners, take you out on fun excursions such as __________ cover your expenses, and of course, I would offer thoughtful and high end presents for special occasions including yoir birthday, Valentines Day, and Christmas\u201d \n\nThen, at least, she would know what she was getting in to!",

I learned this from running a business reselling antiques. People\u2019s heirlooms are priceless to them but worthless to everyone else. When we are attached to something we put a higher value on it than someone else would. Naturally, we love ourselves, and the value we place on our time, personality, appearance could very well be more than someone else would. \n\nI\u2019ve made posts in the past asking SBs to rate themselves- this is to try to get to the essence of this \u201cwhat are you worth\u201d question. If you knew where you fall on the spectrum in your area in terms of looks and personality, you could know what price you can command. We need an algorithm for this! Sorry for the rambling comment, I hope the point comes across.",

They are not a commodity, but most SDs are not financially well-off to the point where spending 4x PPM a month and spending 12 x PPM a month is an inconsequential decision.    It is entirely possible that an SD really values a particular SB a lot, but she wants 12x PPM, and he will instead choose to date someone who he doesn't like but is accepting of 4x a month.   That doesn't mean SBs are a commodity, it just means his overall happiness is hiring spending 4x a month and dating SB2 than it would be spending 12x a month and dating SB1.",

You\u2019re entitled to your opinion, as other people who believe differently are entitled to their opinion. \n\nLet me say this about my position about sugaring as sex work: If your \u201cgift\u201d of money is conditional upon receiving sex, then it seems to me that she\u2019s a type of sex worker, and a Daddy is a type of client, and there\u2019s no shame in that! \n\nBut if there\u2019s no money if there\u2019s no honey...then what else could you call it? \n\nEvery man here is *very* quick to state that no Daddy will do platonic. He must receive sex or else there\u2019s no PPM or allowance, right? So then, how can these men het touchy about being referred to as a client? \n\nThey also get touchy about the semantics surrounding money exchanging hands! \u201cI\u2019m not *paying* her! I\u2019m *gifting* her!!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not money for sex. It\u2019s me enjoying spoiling her\u201d. Yet 99% of these men wouldn\u2019t be giving gifts or spoiling unless the sex was there...\n\nI get that that sex work is stigmatized and it\u2019s not pretty to think that money generally has to be there for the girl to hang out with you and have sex with you. But, when you boil it all down, and remove all the euphemisms and fluff, we\u2019re talking about a woman being incentivized by money to do something she wouldn\u2019t likely seek out of her own volition. \n\nMaybe that stings the heart of the average Daddy, but, how is there any other way to see it?",

                    "body": "Here's the problem with your logic...\n\nEscorts are sex workers. This is their profession. They are highly skilled, and usually reviewed, you know what you're getting into, and most men are going to see them for their primary purpose, to get them off. Most aren't looking to date them, most aren't looking to go to dinner with them.   \n\nEscorts whether they are low end, mid end or high end, are all appealing to a retail customer. When selling something retail, you sell it at the maximum price. Retail customers don't get volume discounts and generally have to pay full price. If you want to equate being a SB to being an escort, then think of a SB as someone who supplies a wholesaler, not someone that sells retail. The SD is getting large blocks of her time each month, versus buying her time by the hour like the end user would with an escort. \n\nEscorts that work for an agency might give half to the agency. If they're a mid level escort and see 3 clients per day, they will only make what the average PPM is for most areas. They may have had to invest 5-6 hours of their time including all the showers and getting ready between dates, and the travel to and from the hotel.\n\nEscorts that are independent pay for their own advertising, hotels, travel, gas, and food, which all comes out of that hourly rate. Where as a SB has none of these expenses, her SD pays for them as part of their arrangement. Think of it like a Benefit package, that an escort doesnt have. Sort of like going for a new job, and they offer 2x per hour, and another offers 15, but there is a huge benefit package that includes holiday pay, health insurance, vacations, and travel expense. The escort is the one with the higher hourly, where as the SB is the one who gets less, but has a ton of other perks. The SD is the one incurring all the expenses of the arrangement versus an escort who has to either pay those expenses herself or her agency does.\n\nSB are not professionals. This was never about being a job, or being a side hustle, regardless of what social media has taught women these days. Wealthy men have dated younger women for aeons, and have helped them financially or spoiled them in exchange. Women have dated these men because they wanted to, not because it was their job, or because they were providing a service like a sex worker.\n\nUnfortunately because of Seeking and social media, there is hybrid NSA sugar arrangement that is something more akin to sex work, but this is not the true nature of a sugar relationship. Yes there are guys on SA looking for escorts, and yes, some are even looking for arrangements, but the truth is, that is not really a sugar relationship in the truest sense, and is closer to a form sex work. Thus why many on SLF argue that sugar relationships are sex work and that SB are sex workers. It's because these people are engaging in a stripped down version of a sugar relationship, that focuses on just the sex and the money. \n\nSB is not an escort, nor is she a sex worker, so you cannot compare the hourly rates of a professional doing her job, to someone in a relationship that is getting financial help and other forms of spoiling.",

Lots of people on SA are Johns/PUAs looking for a quick one with escorts and escort type material.  Lots of people are also escorts or both escort and SB.  It's blurry.\n\nRecognizing the spectrum, I think the real issue is that many of the real SDs here (and I do mean real SDs, there are some here that I dont want to comment on or be associated with) are trying to uphold a particular standard for SRs--traditional/modern SR that borders on SBF/SGF.  Not all of them certainly, but there are a number of us and we're pretty vocal.  We call out other SDs for what we think is improper behavior too.\n\nIf we don't try to uphold any standard, I could see the bowl collapsing in on itself and then we're left with a couple of outcomes:\n\n\\- SDs who want something NSA turn to escorts and hookups on Tinder\n\n\\- SDs who want something more traditional turn to more vanilla apps and have more vanilla affairs\n\nIt's hard to preserve that middle ground, but some of us are trying.

You aren't a provider, what you are describing is a sugar relationship. A provider would not care about any of the above, right? If he was looking for and treating you like a provider and expecting to pay you much less than a provider would be paid, because he met you on an SR site, I agree he's a cheap John not an SD. But a guy who is looking for an SR and who enriches your life and you enjoy dating is probably not going to be looking for an arrangement with similar economics to seeing a provider either. Because providers are paid *a lot* of money to overlook a complete lack of mutual attraction and most clients see providers occasionally, not overnight 4 times a month. Most SDs aren't pulling down well into the 7 figures that would be needed to support that kind of rate and frequency anyway. It doesn't make you salt to not be in the top 1% of 1% of SA.\n\nIt sounds like you have a current SR and if you're happy and getting what you are looking for financially, then I'm happy for you.",

That\u2019s a bit much \ud83d\ude02\n\nLet\u2019s discuss it though- screening is hard because most men won\u2019t screen for us. Sure we meet less guys than an escort but most SD will expect intimacy on a second date, yet the woman won\u2019t know his full name. She can\u2019t google if he\u2019s a criminal. She can\u2019t see if his story checks out. She\u2019s known him for some texting and for a first date, and then boom she\u2019s behind closed doors with him. \n\nSure the risk is less than someone who sees 5 guys a day, but the risk is still there and it\u2019s still terrifying. It only takes one guy to act lovely for some text and a first date, and then rape or kill you on that second date, after he refused to screen, because he\u2019s not a John. And you can\u2019t argue that ;)\n\nOverall though- why are you so dead set on telling me that I should be less concerned about my safety? I know most men are lovely kind people who just want a nice beautiful companion and some great sex, but some are not! \n\nI\u2019m entitled to be as nervous or concerned about my safety as I want to be. Is it a \u201cyou should be less afraid of me, so I can give you less?\u201d.",

As many, including me, have pointed out, there are many good reasons the market has landed where it has. You do not LIKE these reasons, but they exist and they are obviously valid. Because if they were not valid, the market would have landed on a higher price. \n\nYou might think that apples are worth $10 dollars each. You might believe it with all your heart. But if everyone else pays 33 cents for an apple, then an apple is worth 33 cents. \n\nYou may believe that sugar relationships are worth 3x PPM. But on average, everyone else is paying 1x PPM for them. So they are worth 1x PPM. You can rail against this all you want, but you will be just as unsuccessful as everyone else in history who has tried to fight market forces.\n\nIf the market suddenly started pricing SRs at 2x PPM, then any SD who could not pay that would be priced out. Similarly, if an SB requires 2x PPM but the market rate is 1x PPM, the SB will probably have a much harder time finding SDs, or will be a very high value SB for one reason or another. We are all slaves to these market forces, whether we agree or disagree with their decisions does not matter.",

It implies SBs are being systemically oppressed or wronged by \"salt daddies\" and that my comments undermine SBs and enable these \"salt daddies.\" An SD who is offering less than you want is an annoyance, nothing more, and is no different from the annoyance us SDs feel when bombarded with SBs looking for platonic or online only or who don't look like their pictures. And an SB who views me as a walking ATM and thinks in terms of dollars per hour is no different to me than an SD who views his SB as a sex doll. We are not ATMs and sex dolls. Nor are we client and provider. We are human beings looking for some form of romantic relationship that includes financial support. An SB shouldn't be expected to be perfectly made up and sexually available at an SDs whim when they are together, like an escort would be. An SD isn't going to want to pay by the hour or feel like they are on the clock, like a john would be. That doesn't mean platonic on the one hand and vanilla on the other, it simply means sugar is a distinct thing in the middle of the spectrum between those two extremes and you can't usually apply escorting or vanilla standards to sugar dating. \n\nObviously you're free to disagree with me, but I don't see the need to be insulting and dismissive.",

I like a Daddy like a vanilla bf or I don\u2019t see him. I\u2019m happy to fall asleep in my Daddy\u2019s arms after a long night of drinking wine and slow languorous fucking, stay overnight, and then get up, order room service and wake him with a blow job. \n\nLet\u2019s forget what your market dictates ...I think it\u2019s disgraceful that men like you think it\u2019s totally legit to pay big bucks to a stranger who\u2019s faking it, and then cheap out on the girl who legitimately cares for him, and gives him much more real emotions, real interaction, real caring, real orgasms, real vulnerability, etc etc. **That\u2019s what\u2019s salty**. \n\nBut hey- if you think it\u2019s cool to take advantage of a genuine Sugar Baby under the guise of \u201c*but I want it to be less transactional*\u201d then do your thing.\n\nYou\u2019re literally saying \u201cif a sugar baby girl thinks about hanging out with me in a \u2018by the hour\u2019 sense then I don\u2019t want that!

It is her job, its nothing more or less than that, and she will charge what will make it worthwhile to have sex with total strangers many of whom she is completely repulsed by. There is no expectation that a client will make conversation for days ahead of time and schedule a platonic M&G to make sure there's mutual attraction. There is no expectation that a client will provide gifts or dinners. There is no expectation of emotional support from a client. That is all a non-factor. The rates and screening protocols in the US are also much higher due to law enforcement risks that do not exist in sugaring. \n\nIf I understand your logic a vanilla relationship would be even more 'disgraceful' because there is even more emotional connection and less allowance. I just don't see it that way. The emotional connection and attention is a two way street. I'm offering something within my budget that I view as generous and know is in line with what others are offering and accepting in my city. I'm looking for something that is almost identical to casual or serious vanilla dating PLUS a significant amount of direct financial support. That seems like a good deal to me and a lot different from an escort/client relationship. Anyone who isn't happy with that is free to keep looking, no hard feelings, but hardly seems like 'salt' to me.",

I do believe, however, that the money is a primary motivating factor for nearly every SB out there. \n\nSure your advice can be helpful, and it\u2019s nice when you provide emotional support, but would she stay with you if you stopped taking her out to fabulous places, stopped spoiling her, and stopped offering her an allowance or PPM? Let\u2019s keep it real, Daddy! \n\nLikewise, would you continue to offer any form of support if she told you that as of July 1st she will no longer be offering any form of sex- no BJ, no intercourse, nothing??\n\nFWIW, I\u2019m fairly certain your usual SBs would be just fine if you continued on as you always have, but you just started giving them way more money.",

He was like \"oh. that sucks but ok\". Like.. you knew that loser. He got some food for us and we ate it at his place, and it was SILENT. So awkward. I was like aww maybe you should just get an escort. On the ride to pick up food, he also complained about women asking for more than a certain amount, which was COMPLETELY reasonable. The minute a SD complains about past amounts women have asked for.. run. He rushed me out of his house so damn fast LMAO. Also told me he had to \"bust one out\" when I left. \n\nI'm still looking for my real SD. I always think I'm great at vetting but these guys switch on a dime.",

I had a much younger girlfriend for almost 5 years, and I met her when I was broke. I now have a career, but I launched it 20 years too late. I don't have money to burn, but I'm a really solid guy living a very comfortable lifestyle. \n\nBecause I'm intolerant of children, I'm pretty useless to women my age. And I'm more interested in my podcast, playing hand drums in the park, managing my career & household, etc., than I am in having a LTR. \n\nSo, if you don't mind me asking, are dudes actually up front with the \"salt\" thing?

                    "body": "*\u201dDo any of these guys include the word \"salt\" in their profiles? Would it matter?\u201d*\n\nAll those who I\u2019ve run into online, who don\u2019t offer allowance or PPM have not included the word Salt or Splenda. In fact, usually they\u2019re saying things like \u201cready to spoil you\u201d or \u201cgenerous\u201d. I guess we all have different versions of what spoiling means, though. \n\nI absolutely wish they would list this in the profile. Thing is- does anyone really like to admit that they\u2019re on the low rent end of something? Not many people are comfy with that. \u201cHey I\u2019m not your typical Sugar Daddy, as i can\u2019t pay you a PPM equivalent to what you would make serving dinner at AverageSteakhouse, but hey, take Friday off work to go out with me anyways!!\u201d\n\nIf a Daddy isn\u2019t willing to do PPM or allowance, I wish he would be upfront about saying that on Seeking. I recently encountered one fine gentleman. Very cultured and charming. Great profile pics clearly indicating significant wealth, or him being in the company of wealth and being comfortable. Examples: him on yacht wearing LV loafers, with crystal blue seas to the horizons, gold Rolex; him in the backseat of a Phantom, him at a very luxe looking tropical resort. \n\nChatted me up over 10 days. Finally tells me he doesn\u2019t do PPM or allowance, no sugar at all except \u201coccasionally we will go shopping together\u201d. He \u201cdoesn\u2019t want someone who wants him for his wallet\u201d. Yet he\u2019s on a site where people go to gain companionship and sex in exchange for money...\n\nAnother man who represented himself as a Daddy \u201cwho wanted to spoil me rotten\u201d told me he would take me for a weekend getaway to a 3 star hotel the next town over. The room had a late 80s \u201cjacuzzi bath\u201d and he would buy us  room service. I told him that hotel doesn\u2019t offer room service and he laughed and said \u201coh I mean takeout, but delivered\u201d. When I asked about allowance for the weekend, he said that staying in with him for two days straight, and \u201cmy prodigious cunnilingus skills\u201d were my benefit. This all from a man who asked to meet me at a mall and offered me a smoothie date LOL\n\n\nI think for me- if I was a male who was attracted to being a Daddy, but I wasn\u2019t comfortable giving PPM or allowance, I would just be explicit about it. To me it would be a waste of time wading through all the women who wanted allowance, to find the ones who were okay without one. Likewise, I find it a waste of my time when someone is on a Daddy site and they don\u2019t seem to want to spend more 1k annually, but expect all the benefits. \n\nI\u2019d say something like this: \n\u201cI\u2019m not able to offer an allowance or PPM, but I do promise to treat you to wonderful dinners, take you out on fun excursions such as __________ cover your expenses, and of course, I would offer thoughtful and high end presents for special occasions including yoir birthday, Valentines Day, and Christmas\u201d \n\nThen, at least, she would know what she was getting in to!",

I promise that if I set up a new profile, it will be screaming salt. I'm not as good looking as I was when I was in my 20's, but I'm stronger, and I am owning this pandemic like a fucking warlord. \n\nBe well, and thanks again. Good luck.",

I can at least understand where @HwdSD is coming from and trace the logic. This is an uncomfortable conversation in some ways because it assumes that women are a commodity- at the end of the day, that is the case in some ways, particularly when you are in the browsing SA stage. \n\nI can say that my car is worth 50,000 to me because I really like it, but it\u2019s actually only worth what someone else is willing to pay. I learned this from running a business reselling antiques. People\u2019s heirlooms are priceless to them but worthless to everyone else. When we are attached to something we put a higher value on it than someone else would. Naturally, we love ourselves, and the value we place on our time, personality, appearance could very well be more than someone else would. \n\nI\u2019ve made posts in the past asking SBs to rate themselves- this is to try to get to the essence of this \u201cwhat are you worth\u201d question. If you knew where you fall on the spectrum in your area in terms of looks and personality, you could know what price you can command. We need an algorithm for this!

It is entirely possible that an SD really values a particular SB a lot, but she wants 12x PPM, and he will instead choose to date someone who he doesn't like but is accepting of 4x a month.

You\u2019re entitled to your opinion, as other people who believe differently are entitled to their opinion. \n\nLet me say this about my position about sugaring as sex work: If your \u201cgift\u201d of money is conditional upon receiving sex, then it seems to me that she\u2019s a type of sex worker, and a Daddy is a type of client, and there\u2019s no shame in that! \n\nBut if there\u2019s no money if there\u2019s no honey...then what else could you call it? \n\nEvery man here is *very* quick to state that no Daddy will do platonic. He must receive sex or else there\u2019s no PPM or allowance, right? So then, how can these men het touchy about being referred to as a client? \n\nThey also get touchy about the semantics surrounding money exchanging hands! \u201cI\u2019m not *paying* her! I\u2019m *gifting* her!!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not money for sex. It\u2019s me enjoying spoiling her\u201d. Yet 99% of these men wouldn\u2019t be giving gifts or spoiling unless the sex was there...\n\nI get that that sex work is stigmatized and it\u2019s not pretty to think that money generally has to be there for the girl to hang out with you and have sex with you. But, when you boil it all down, and remove all the euphemisms and fluff, we\u2019re talking about a woman being incentivized by money to do something she wouldn\u2019t likely seek out of her own volition. \n\nMaybe that stings the heart of the average Daddy, but, how is there any other way to see it?",

They are highly skilled, and usually reviewed, you know what you're getting into, and most men are going to see them for their primary purpose, to get them off. Most aren't looking to date them, most aren't looking to go to dinner with them.   \n\nEscorts whether they are low end, mid end or high end, are all appealing to a retail customer. When selling something retail, you sell it at the maximum price. Retail customers don't get volume discounts and generally have to pay full price. If you want to equate being a SB to being an escort, then think of a SB as someone who supplies a wholesaler, not someone that sells retail. The SD is getting large blocks of her time each month, versus buying her time by the hour like the end user would with an escort. \n\nEscorts that work for an agency might give half to the agency. If they're a mid level escort and see 3 clients per day, they will only make what the average PPM is for most areas. They may have had to invest 5-6 hours of their time including all the showers and getting ready between dates, and the travel to and from the hotel.\n\nEscorts that are independent pay for their own advertising, hotels, travel, gas, and food, which all comes out of that hourly rate. Where as a SB has none of these expenses, her SD pays for them as part of their arrangement. Think of it like a Benefit package, that an escort doesnt have. Sort of like going for a new job, and they offer 2x per hour, and another offers 15, but there is a huge benefit package that includes holiday pay, health insurance, vacations, and travel expense. The escort is the one with the higher hourly, where as the SB is the one who gets less, but has a ton of other perks. The SD is the one incurring all the expenses of the arrangement versus an escort who has to either pay those expenses herself or her agency does.\n\nSB are not professionals. This was never about being a job, or being a side hustle, regardless of what social media has taught women these days. Wealthy men have dated younger women for aeons, and have helped them financially or spoiled them in exchange. Women have dated these men because they wanted to, not because it was their job, or because they were providing a service like a sex worker.\n\nUnfortunately because of Seeking and social media, there is hybrid NSA sugar arrangement that is something more akin to sex work, but this is not the true nature of a sugar relationship. Yes there are guys on SA looking for escorts, and yes, some are even looking for arrangements, but the truth is, that is not really a sugar relationship in the truest sense, and is closer to a form sex work. Thus why many on SLF argue that sugar relationships are sex work and that SB are sex workers. It's because these people are engaging in a stripped down version of a sugar relationship, that focuses on just the sex and the money. \n\nSB is not an escort, nor is she a sex worker, so you cannot compare the hourly rates of a professional doing her job, to someone in a relationship that is getting financial help and other forms of spoiling.",

Is that not a thing here, generally? \n\nCan we agree on the notion that there isn\u2019t one \u201cglobally accepted as objective fact\u201d definition of what a SR, a SD, and SB must be and must not be? \n\nIt seems you want to stick to the idea that no Sugar Baby could everrrrr be a sex worker and that they don\u2019t do it for the money that they receive. And that no Daddy is a client. He\u2019s just donating money to spoil her, or whatever you are most comfortable calling the exchange of money that flows from him to her, and is contingent on the provision of sex...\n\nI believe in an idea that is different.

Lots of people on SA are Johns/PUAs looking for a quick one with escorts and escort type material.  Lots of people are also escorts or both escort and SB.  It's blurry.\n\nRecognizing the spectrum, I think the real issue is that many of the real SDs here (and I do mean real SDs, there are some here that I dont want to comment on or be associated with) are trying to uphold a particular standard for SRs--traditional/modern SR that borders on SBF/SGF.  Not all of them certainly, but there are a number of us and we're pretty vocal.  We call out other SDs for what we think is improper behavior too.\n\nIf we don't try to uphold any standard, I could see the bowl collapsing in on itself and then we're left with a couple of outcomes:\n\n\\- SDs who want something NSA turn to escorts and hookups on Tinder\n\n\\- SDs who want something more traditional turn to more vanilla apps and have more vanilla affairs\n\nIt's hard to preserve that middle ground, but some of us are trying.  I'd like to think thats what SLF is for because there are guidelines here around what is/isnt an arrangement/SR.",

You aren't a provider, what you are describing is a sugar relationship. A provider would not care about any of the above, right? If he was looking for and treating you like a provider and expecting to pay you much less than a provider would be paid, because he met you on an SR site, I agree he's a cheap John not an SD. But a guy who is looking for an SR and who enriches your life and you enjoy dating is probably not going to be looking for an arrangement with similar economics to seeing a provider either. Because providers are paid *a lot* of money to overlook a complete lack of mutual attraction and most clients see providers occasionally, not overnight 4 times a month. Most SDs aren't pulling down well into the 7 figures that would be needed to support that kind of rate and frequency anyway. It doesn't make you salt to not be in the top 1% of 1% of SA.\n\nIt sounds like you have a current SR and if you're happy and getting what you are looking for financially, then I'm happy for you.",

When I ask for a PPM that is only received by me if I provide (amongst other things) sexual acts, then I will charged with prostitution in my city. Especially when 80% of the \u201cDaddies\u201d are following up me telling them my PPM number with \u201cbut will I get BJ with no condoms and can we do anal, too?\u201d\n\n* I can\u2019t measure how much an escort feels fear about STI, but if I\u2019m having sex with a new Daddy, I am worried. Because you can be damn sure he wants a blow job with no condom and he wants to go down on me. If I was an escort who didn\u2019t offer those services, I\u2019d likely worry more as a SB. Sure my volume would likely be lower, but my risks would be higher!\n\n* emotional support is a wonderful thing, and certainly does \u201ccompensate\u201d a woman. I 100% agree with this, and that\u2019s why I will never date a Daddy who isn\u2019t kind, caring, considerate and thoughtful! \n\n* mentorship isn\u2019t a thing for some SB, and it certainly isn\u2019t a major factor for me! I have a vanilla mentor and vanilla coach. I\u2019m not seeking that during pillow talk, nor would I be likely to find a SD who would be a SME in my field, as I work in a field that is very women centric and millennial drive\n\n* real connection is wonderful, but not all SB want or need it.

No wonder you don't get why the cash cost is lower.\n\n\"physical safety - this one is laughable to for me\"\n\nOf course there is still physical risk. But if you are screening properly pre and during the M&G, then you should hopefully only have to take that risk a few times a year, not multiple times a week, with someone whom you have screened relatively well. The risk is FAR lower, and you can't argue that.",

I don\u2019t have to state PPM in writing to be saying what I\u2019m saying.\n\nAnd screening well is *really* difficult as most Daddies will only screen for an escort.\n\nYour vanilla gf doesn\u2019t say \u201cdaddy, I\u2019m happy with $XXX per date\u201d.  SB do say these sorts of thing.  Daddies typically ask \u201cand we can include intimacy on each dates?\u201d And I reply yes, and then it\u2019s out there.  \n\nI can call is ### roses or #### donation for my business, but the intent is there and everyone knows what we\u2019re both talking about.  Then LEO can peg me for prostitution. I don\u2019t know the stats but with FOSTA SESTA being the new thing, SB are definitely at risk! \n\n\nAre you kidding me about STI risk? If I have unprotected sex with one SD who has HIV, how is my risk is lower than having multiple partners who wear protection? \n\nHow am I not a \u201creal SB\u201d because I don\u2019t seek mentorship? Does every man have a complex with wanting to be oh so smart and valued for his opinion? I work in a very very niche field. Very very few Daddies would be able to give me solid advice. I\u2019m not fake because I\u2019m savvy enough to know that. \n\nAs for emotional connection- I didn\u2019t say I didn\u2019t want it. In fact I do. I said not all SB want it, because not all do. \n\nAs for physical risk- I can argue whatever I want lol. Stating your opinion and saying I can\u2019t argue it is hilarious. Nonetheless, I do tend to agree with your point, haha. But honestly, to say that I can\u2019t argue it? That\u2019s a bit much \ud83d\ude02\n\nLet\u2019s discuss it though- screening is hard because most men won\u2019t screen for us. Sure we meet less guys than an escort but most SD will expect intimacy on a second date, yet the woman won\u2019t know his full name. She can\u2019t google if he\u2019s a criminal. She can\u2019t see if his story checks out. She\u2019s known him for some texting and for a first date, and then boom she\u2019s behind closed doors with him. \n\nSure the risk is less than someone who sees 5 guys a day, but the risk is still there and it\u2019s still terrifying. It only takes one guy to act lovely for some text and a first date, and then rape or kill you on that second date, after he refused to screen, because he\u2019s not a John. And you can\u2019t argue that ;)\n\nOverall though- why are you so dead set on telling me that I should be less concerned about my safety? I know most men are lovely kind people who just want a nice beautiful companion and some great sex, but some are not! \n\nI\u2019m entitled to be as nervous or concerned about my safety as I want to be. Is it a \u201cyou should be less afraid of me, so I can give you less?\u201d.",

But on average, everyone else is paying 1x PPM for them. So they are worth 1x PPM. You can rail against this all you want, but you will be just as unsuccessful as everyone else in history who has tried to fight market forces.\n\nIf the market suddenly started pricing SRs at 2x PPM, then any SD who could not pay that would be priced out. Similarly, if an SB requires 2x PPM but the market rate is 1x PPM, the SB will probably have a much harder time finding SDs, or will be a very high value SB for one reason or another.

You need to take a step back. We're all (SDs and SBs) dealing with a ton of time wasters and BS on SA right now and I get that's frustrating. But come on.

It implies SBs are being systemically oppressed or wronged by \"salt daddies\" and that my comments undermine SBs and enable these \"salt daddies.\" An SD who is offering less than you want is an annoyance, nothing more, and is no different from the annoyance us SDs feel when bombarded with SBs looking for platonic or online only or who don't look like their pictures. And an SB who views me as a walking ATM and thinks in terms of dollars per hour is no different to me than an SD who views his SB as a sex doll. We are not ATMs and sex dolls. Nor are we client and provider. We are human beings looking for some form of romantic relationship that includes financial support. An SB shouldn't be expected to be perfectly made up and sexually available at an SDs whim when they are together, like an escort would be. An SD isn't going to want to pay by the hour or feel like they are on the clock, like a john would be. That doesn't mean platonic on the one hand and vanilla on the other, it simply means sugar is a distinct thing in the middle of the spectrum between those two extremes and you can't usually apply escorting or vanilla standards to sugar dating. \n\nObviously you're free to disagree with me, but I don't see the need to be insulting and dismissive.",

There is no expectation that a client will make conversation for days ahead of time and schedule a platonic M&G to make sure there's mutual attraction. There is no expectation that a client will provide gifts or dinners. There is no expectation of emotional support from a client. That is all a non-factor. The rates and screening protocols in the US are also much higher due to law enforcement risks that do not exist in sugaring. \n\nIf I understand your logic a vanilla relationship would be even more 'disgraceful' because there is even more emotional connection and less allowance. I just don't see it that way. The emotional connection and attention is a two way street. I'm offering something within my budget that I view as generous and know is in line with what others are offering and accepting in my city. I'm looking for something that is almost identical to casual or serious vanilla dating PLUS a significant amount of direct financial support. That seems like a good deal to me and a lot different from an escort/client relationship. Anyone who isn't happy with that is free to keep looking, no hard feelings, but hardly seems like 'salt' to me.",

I do believe, however, that the money is a primary motivating factor for nearly every SB out there. \n\nSure your advice can be helpful, and it\u2019s nice when you provide emotional support, but would she stay with you if you stopped taking her out to fabulous places, stopped spoiling her, and stopped offering her an allowance or PPM? Let\u2019s keep it real, Daddy! \n\nLikewise, would you continue to offer any form of support if she told you that as of July 1st she will no longer be offering any form of sex- no BJ, no intercourse, nothing??\n\nFWIW, I\u2019m fairly certain your usual SBs would be just fine if you continued on as you always have, but you just started giving them way more money.",

Would it matter?\u201d*\n\nAll those who I\u2019ve run into online, who don\u2019t offer allowance or PPM have not included the word Salt or Splenda. In fact, usually they\u2019re saying things like \u201cready to spoil you\u201d or \u201cgenerous\u201d. I guess we all have different versions of what spoiling means, though. \n\nI absolutely wish they would list this in the profile. Thing is- does anyone really like to admit that they\u2019re on the low rent end of something? Not many people are comfy with that. \u201cHey I\u2019m not your typical Sugar Daddy, as i can\u2019t pay you a PPM equivalent to what you would make serving dinner at AverageSteakhouse, but hey, take Friday off work to go out with me anyways!!\u201d\n\nIf a Daddy isn\u2019t willing to do PPM or allowance, I wish he would be upfront about saying that on Seeking. I recently encountered one fine gentleman. Very cultured and charming. Great profile pics clearly indicating significant wealth, or him being in the company of wealth and being comfortable. Examples: him on yacht wearing LV loafers, with crystal blue seas to the horizons, gold Rolex; him in the backseat of a Phantom, him at a very luxe looking tropical resort. \n\nChatted me up over 10 days. Finally tells me he doesn\u2019t do PPM or allowance, no sugar at all except \u201coccasionally we will go shopping together\u201d. He \u201cdoesn\u2019t want someone who wants him for his wallet\u201d. Yet he\u2019s on a site where people go to gain companionship and sex in exchange for money...\n\nAnother man who represented himself as a Daddy \u201cwho wanted to spoil me rotten\u201d told me he would take me for a weekend getaway to a 3 star hotel the next town over. The room had a late 80s \u201cjacuzzi bath\u201d and he would buy us  room service. I told him that hotel doesn\u2019t offer room service and he laughed and said \u201coh I mean takeout, but delivered\u201d. When I asked about allowance for the weekend, he said that staying in with him for two days straight, and \u201cmy prodigious cunnilingus skills\u201d were my benefit. This all from a man who asked to meet me at a mall and offered me a smoothie date LOL\n\n\nI think for me- if I was a male who was attracted to being a Daddy, but I wasn\u2019t comfortable giving PPM or allowance, I would just be explicit about it. To me it would be a waste of time wading through all the women who wanted allowance, to find the ones who were okay without one. Likewise, I find it a waste of my time when someone is on a Daddy site and they don\u2019t seem to want to spend more 1k annually, but expect all the benefits. \n\nI\u2019d say something like this: \n\u201cI\u2019m not able to offer an allowance or PPM, but I do promise to treat you to wonderful dinners, take you out on fun excursions such as __________ cover your expenses, and of course, I would offer thoughtful and high end presents for special occasions including yoir birthday, Valentines Day, and Christmas\u201d \n\nThen, at least, she would know what she was getting in to!",

My biceps/triceps are nothing to write home about, but my forearms are nice and sinewy from lifting and drumming.

I promise that if I set up a new profile, it will be screaming salt. I'm not as good looking as I was when I was in my 20's, but I'm stronger, and I am owning this pandemic like a fucking warlord. \n\nBe well, and thanks again. Good luck.",

You\u2019re entitled to your opinion, as other people who believe differently are entitled to their opinion. \n\nLet me say this about my position about sugaring as sex work: If your \u201cgift\u201d of money is conditional upon receiving sex, then it seems to me that she\u2019s a type of sex worker, and a Daddy is a type of client, and there\u2019s no shame in that! \n\nBut if there\u2019s no money if there\u2019s no honey...then what else could you call it? \n\nEvery man here is *very* quick to state that no Daddy will do platonic. He must receive sex or else there\u2019s no PPM or allowance, right? So then, how can these men het touchy about being referred to as a client? \n\nThey also get touchy about the semantics surrounding money exchanging hands! \u201cI\u2019m not *paying* her! I\u2019m *gifting* her!!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not money for sex. It\u2019s me enjoying spoiling her\u201d. Yet 99% of these men wouldn\u2019t be giving gifts or spoiling unless the sex was there...\n\nI get that that sex work is stigmatized and it\u2019s not pretty to think that money generally has to be there for the girl to hang out with you and have sex with you. But, when you boil it all down, and remove all the euphemisms and fluff, we\u2019re talking about a woman being incentivized by money to do something she wouldn\u2019t likely seek out of her own volition. \n\nMaybe that stings the heart of the average Daddy, but, how is there any other way to see it?",

It's blurry.\n\nRecognizing the spectrum, I think the real issue is that many of the real SDs here (and I do mean real SDs, there are some here that I dont want to comment on or be associated with) are trying to uphold a particular standard for SRs--traditional/modern SR that borders on SBF/SGF.  Not all of them certainly, but there are a number of us and we're pretty vocal.  We call out other SDs for what we think is improper behavior too.\n\nIf we don't try to uphold any standard, I could see the bowl collapsing in on itself and then we're left with a couple of outcomes:\n\n\\- SDs who want something NSA turn to escorts and hookups on Tinder\n\n\\- SDs who want something more traditional turn to more vanilla apps and have more vanilla affairs\n\nIt's hard to preserve that middle ground, but some of us are trying.

When I ask for a PPM that is only received by me if I provide (amongst other things) sexual acts, then I will charged with prostitution in my city. Especially when 80% of the \u201cDaddies\u201d are following up me telling them my PPM number with \u201cbut will I get BJ with no condoms and can we do anal, too?\u201d\n\n* I can\u2019t measure how much an escort feels fear about STI, but if I\u2019m having sex with a new Daddy, I am worried. Because you can be damn sure he wants a blow job with no condom and he wants to go down on me. If I was an escort who didn\u2019t offer those services, I\u2019d likely worry more as a SB. Sure my volume would likely be lower, but my risks would be higher!\n\n* emotional support is a wonderful thing, and certainly does \u201ccompensate\u201d a woman. I 100% agree with this, and that\u2019s why I will never date a Daddy who isn\u2019t kind, caring, considerate and thoughtful! \n\n* mentorship isn\u2019t a thing for some SB, and it certainly isn\u2019t a major factor for me! I have a vanilla mentor and vanilla coach. I\u2019m not seeking that during pillow talk, nor would I be likely to find a SD who would be a SME in my field, as I work in a field that is very women centric and millennial drive\n\n* real connection is wonderful, but not all SB want or need it.

That\u2019s a bit much \ud83d\ude02\n\nLet\u2019s discuss it though- screening is hard because most men won\u2019t screen for us. Sure we meet less guys than an escort but most SD will expect intimacy on a second date, yet the woman won\u2019t know his full name. She can\u2019t google if he\u2019s a criminal. She can\u2019t see if his story checks out. She\u2019s known him for some texting and for a first date, and then boom she\u2019s behind closed doors with him. \n\nSure the risk is less than someone who sees 5 guys a day, but the risk is still there and it\u2019s still terrifying. It only takes one guy to act lovely for some text and a first date, and then rape or kill you on that second date, after he refused to screen, because he\u2019s not a John. And you can\u2019t argue that ;)\n\nOverall though- why are you so dead set on telling me that I should be less concerned about my safety? I know most men are lovely kind people who just want a nice beautiful companion and some great sex, but some are not! \n\nI\u2019m entitled to be as nervous or concerned about my safety as I want to be. Is it a \u201cyou should be less afraid of me, so I can give you less?\u201d.",

As many, including me, have pointed out, there are many good reasons the market has landed where it has. You do not LIKE these reasons, but they exist and they are obviously valid. Because if they were not valid, the market would have landed on a higher price. \n\nYou might think that apples are worth $10 dollars each. You might believe it with all your heart. But if everyone else pays 33 cents for an apple, then an apple is worth 33 cents. \n\nYou may believe that sugar relationships are worth 3x PPM. But on average, everyone else is paying 1x PPM for them. So they are worth 1x PPM. You can rail against this all you want, but you will be just as unsuccessful as everyone else in history who has tried to fight market forces.\n\nIf the market suddenly started pricing SRs at 2x PPM, then any SD who could not pay that would be priced out. Similarly, if an SB requires 2x PPM but the market rate is 1x PPM, the SB will probably have a much harder time finding SDs, or will be a very high value SB for one reason or another. We are all slaves to these market forces, whether we agree or disagree with their decisions does not matter.",

It is her job, its nothing more or less than that, and she will charge what will make it worthwhile to have sex with total strangers many of whom she is completely repulsed by. There is no expectation that a client will make conversation for days ahead of time and schedule a platonic M&G to make sure there's mutual attraction. There is no expectation that a client will provide gifts or dinners. There is no expectation of emotional support from a client. That is all a non-factor. The rates and screening protocols in the US are also much higher due to law enforcement risks that do not exist in sugaring. \n\nIf I understand your logic a vanilla relationship would be even more 'disgraceful' because there is even more emotional connection and less allowance. I just don't see it that way. The emotional connection and attention is a two way street. I'm offering something within my budget that I view as generous and know is in line with what others are offering and accepting in my city. I'm looking for something that is almost identical to casual or serious vanilla dating PLUS a significant amount of direct financial support. That seems like a good deal to me and a lot different from an escort/client relationship. Anyone who isn't happy with that is free to keep looking, no hard feelings, but hardly seems like 'salt' to me.",

The money just helps bridge the gap in terms of age, availability (as lots of SDs are married), etc.\n\nIf you want to maximise profit, that\u2019s fine, there\u2019s no rulebook on how to do this, but there are people with also legitimate relationships that will have a different, equally valid, point of view.\n\nFWIW my usual SBs would not be comfortable getting paid escort rates as that conveys a set of expectations they are not ready to fulfil.",

Let\u2019s keep it real, Daddy! \n\nLikewise, would you continue to offer any form of support if she told you that as of July 1st she will no longer be offering any form of sex- no BJ, no intercourse, nothing??\n\nFWIW, I\u2019m fairly certain your usual SBs would be just fine if you continued on as you always have, but you just started giving them way more money.",

Lots of people on SA are Johns/PUAs looking for a quick one with escorts and escort type material.  Lots of people are also escorts or both escort and SB.  It's blurry.\n\nRecognizing the spectrum, I think the real issue is that many of the real SDs here (and I do mean real SDs, there are some here that I dont want to comment on or be associated with) are trying to uphold a particular standard for SRs--traditional/modern SR that borders on SBF/SGF.  Not all of them certainly, but there are a number of us and we're pretty vocal.  We call out other SDs for what we think is improper behavior too.\n\nIf we don't try to uphold any standard, I could see the bowl collapsing in on itself and then we're left with a couple of outcomes:\n\n\\- SDs who want something NSA turn to escorts and hookups on Tinder\n\n\\- SDs who want something more traditional turn to more vanilla apps and have more vanilla affairs\n\nIt's hard to preserve that middle ground, but some of us are trying.  I'd like to think thats what SLF is for because there are guidelines here around what is/isnt an arrangement/SR.",

I don\u2019t have to state PPM in writing to be saying what I\u2019m saying.\n\nAnd screening well is *really* difficult as most Daddies will only screen for an escort.\n\nYour vanilla gf doesn\u2019t say \u201cdaddy, I\u2019m happy with $XXX per date\u201d.  SB do say these sorts of thing.  Daddies typically ask \u201cand we can include intimacy on each dates?\u201d And I reply yes, and then it\u2019s out there.  \n\nI can call is ### roses or #### donation for my business, but the intent is there and everyone knows what we\u2019re both talking about.  Then LEO can peg me for prostitution. I don\u2019t know the stats but with FOSTA SESTA being the new thing, SB are definitely at risk! \n\n\nAre you kidding me about STI risk? If I have unprotected sex with one SD who has HIV, how is my risk is lower than having multiple partners who wear protection? \n\nHow am I not a \u201creal SB\u201d because I don\u2019t seek mentorship? Does every man have a complex with wanting to be oh so smart and valued for his opinion? I work in a very very niche field. Very very few Daddies would be able to give me solid advice. I\u2019m not fake because I\u2019m savvy enough to know that. \n\nAs for emotional connection- I didn\u2019t say I didn\u2019t want it. In fact I do. I said not all SB want it, because not all do. \n\nAs for physical risk- I can argue whatever I want lol. Stating your opinion and saying I can\u2019t argue it is hilarious. Nonetheless, I do tend to agree with your point, haha. But honestly, to say that I can\u2019t argue it? That\u2019s a bit much \ud83d\ude02\n\nLet\u2019s discuss it though- screening is hard because most men won\u2019t screen for us. Sure we meet less guys than an escort but most SD will expect intimacy on a second date, yet the woman won\u2019t know his full name. She can\u2019t google if he\u2019s a criminal. She can\u2019t see if his story checks out. She\u2019s known him for some texting and for a first date, and then boom she\u2019s behind closed doors with him. \n\nSure the risk is less than someone who sees 5 guys a day, but the risk is still there and it\u2019s still terrifying. It only takes one guy to act lovely for some text and a first date, and then rape or kill you on that second date, after he refused to screen, because he\u2019s not a John. And you can\u2019t argue that ;)\n\nOverall though- why are you so dead set on telling me that I should be less concerned about my safety? I know most men are lovely kind people who just want a nice beautiful companion and some great sex, but some are not! \n\nI\u2019m entitled to be as nervous or concerned about my safety as I want to be. Is it a \u201cyou should be less afraid of me, so I can give you less?\u201d.",

You can rail against this all you want, but you will be just as unsuccessful as everyone else in history who has tried to fight market forces.\n\nIf the market suddenly started pricing SRs at 2x PPM, then any SD who could not pay that would be priced out. Similarly, if an SB requires 2x PPM but the market rate is 1x PPM, the SB will probably have a much harder time finding SDs, or will be a very high value SB for one reason or another. We are all slaves to these market forces, whether we agree or disagree with their decisions does not matter.",

It implies SBs are being systemically oppressed or wronged by \"salt daddies\" and that my comments undermine SBs and enable these \"salt daddies.\" An SD who is offering less than you want is an annoyance, nothing more, and is no different from the annoyance us SDs feel when bombarded with SBs looking for platonic or online only or who don't look like their pictures. And an SB who views me as a walking ATM and thinks in terms of dollars per hour is no different to me than an SD who views his SB as a sex doll. We are not ATMs and sex dolls. Nor are we client and provider. We are human beings looking for some form of romantic relationship that includes financial support. An SB shouldn't be expected to be perfectly made up and sexually available at an SDs whim when they are together, like an escort would be. An SD isn't going to want to pay by the hour or feel like they are on the clock, like a john would be. That doesn't mean platonic on the one hand and vanilla on the other, it simply means sugar is a distinct thing in the middle of the spectrum between those two extremes and you can't usually apply escorting or vanilla standards to sugar dating. \n\nObviously you're free to disagree with me, but I don't see the need to be insulting and dismissive.",

There is no expectation that a client will provide gifts or dinners. There is no expectation of emotional support from a client. That is all a non-factor. The rates and screening protocols in the US are also much higher due to law enforcement risks that do not exist in sugaring. \n\nIf I understand your logic a vanilla relationship would be even more 'disgraceful' because there is even more emotional connection and less allowance. I just don't see it that way. The emotional connection and attention is a two way street. I'm offering something within my budget that I view as generous and know is in line with what others are offering and accepting in my city. I'm looking for something that is almost identical to casual or serious vanilla dating PLUS a significant amount of direct financial support. That seems like a good deal to me and a lot different from an escort/client relationship. Anyone who isn't happy with that is free to keep looking, no hard feelings, but hardly seems like 'salt' to me.",

Let\u2019s keep it real, Daddy! \n\nLikewise, would you continue to offer any form of support if she told you that as of July 1st she will no longer be offering any form of sex- no BJ, no intercourse, nothing??\n\nFWIW, I\u2019m fairly certain your usual SBs would be just fine if you continued on as you always have, but you just started giving them way more money.",

I said not all SB want it, because not all do. \n\nAs for physical risk- I can argue whatever I want lol. Stating your opinion and saying I can\u2019t argue it is hilarious. Nonetheless, I do tend to agree with your point, haha. But honestly, to say that I can\u2019t argue it? That\u2019s a bit much \ud83d\ude02\n\nLet\u2019s discuss it though- screening is hard because most men won\u2019t screen for us. Sure we meet less guys than an escort but most SD will expect intimacy on a second date, yet the woman won\u2019t know his full name. She can\u2019t google if he\u2019s a criminal. She can\u2019t see if his story checks out. She\u2019s known him for some texting and for a first date, and then boom she\u2019s behind closed doors with him. \n\nSure the risk is less than someone who sees 5 guys a day, but the risk is still there and it\u2019s still terrifying. It only takes one guy to act lovely for some text and a first date, and then rape or kill you on that second date, after he refused to screen, because he\u2019s not a John. And you can\u2019t argue that ;)\n\nOverall though- why are you so dead set on telling me that I should be less concerned about my safety? I know most men are lovely kind people who just want a nice beautiful companion and some great sex, but some are not! \n\nI\u2019m entitled to be as nervous or concerned about my safety as I want to be. Is it a \u201cyou should be less afraid of me, so I can give you less?\u201d.",

                    "body": "Clearly you have a set opinion and no amount of discussion will change that. \n\nThe fact is, market forces have determined the cash price for SBs, and that cash price is lower than for escorts. As many, including me, have pointed out, there are many good reasons the market has landed where it has. You do not LIKE these reasons, but they exist and they are obviously valid. Because if they were not valid, the market would have landed on a higher price. \n\nYou might think that apples are worth $10 dollars each. You might believe it with all your heart. But if everyone else pays 33 cents for an apple, then an apple is worth 33 cents. \n\nYou may believe that sugar relationships are worth 3x PPM. But on average, everyone else is paying 1x PPM for them. So they are worth 1x PPM. You can rail against this all you want, but you will be just as unsuccessful as everyone else in history who has tried to fight market forces.\n\nIf the market suddenly started pricing SRs at 2x PPM, then any SD who could not pay that would be priced out. Similarly, if an SB requires 2x PPM but the market rate is 1x PPM, the SB will probably have a much harder time finding SDs, or will be a very high value SB for one reason or another. We are all slaves to these market forces, whether we agree or disagree with their decisions does not matter.",

You need to take a step back. We're all (SDs and SBs) dealing with a ton of time wasters and BS on SA right now and I get that's frustrating. But come on.

It implies SBs are being systemically oppressed or wronged by \"salt daddies\" and that my comments undermine SBs and enable these \"salt daddies.\" An SD who is offering less than you want is an annoyance, nothing more, and is no different from the annoyance us SDs feel when bombarded with SBs looking for platonic or online only or who don't look like their pictures. And an SB who views me as a walking ATM and thinks in terms of dollars per hour is no different to me than an SD who views his SB as a sex doll. We are not ATMs and sex dolls. Nor are we client and provider. We are human beings looking for some form of romantic relationship that includes financial support. An SB shouldn't be expected to be perfectly made up and sexually available at an SDs whim when they are together, like an escort would be. An SD isn't going to want to pay by the hour or feel like they are on the clock, like a john would be. That doesn't mean platonic on the one hand and vanilla on the other, it simply means sugar is a distinct thing in the middle of the spectrum between those two extremes and you can't usually apply escorting or vanilla standards to sugar dating. \n\nObviously you're free to disagree with me, but I don't see the need to be insulting and dismissive.",

There is no expectation that a client will provide gifts or dinners. There is no expectation of emotional support from a client. That is all a non-factor.

Let\u2019s keep it real, Daddy! \n\nLikewise, would you continue to offer any form of support if she told you that as of July 1st she will no longer be offering any form of sex- no BJ, no intercourse, nothing??\n\nFWIW, I\u2019m fairly certain your usual SBs would be just fine if you continued on as you always have, but you just started giving them way more money.",

As many, including me, have pointed out, there are many good reasons the market has landed where it has. You do not LIKE these reasons, but they exist and they are obviously valid. Because if they were not valid, the market would have landed on a higher price. \n\nYou might think that apples are worth $10 dollars each. You might believe it with all your heart. But if everyone else pays 33 cents for an apple, then an apple is worth 33 cents. \n\nYou may believe that sugar relationships are worth 3x PPM. But on average, everyone else is paying 1x PPM for them. So they are worth 1x PPM. You can rail against this all you want, but you will be just as unsuccessful as everyone else in history who has tried to fight market forces.\n\nIf the market suddenly started pricing SRs at 2x PPM, then any SD who could not pay that would be priced out. Similarly, if an SB requires 2x PPM but the market rate is 1x PPM, the SB will probably have a much harder time finding SDs, or will be a very high value SB for one reason or another. We are all slaves to these market forces, whether we agree or disagree with their decisions does not matter.",

It implies SBs are being systemically oppressed or wronged by \"salt daddies\" and that my comments undermine SBs and enable these \"salt daddies.\" An SD who is offering less than you want is an annoyance, nothing more, and is no different from the annoyance us SDs feel when bombarded with SBs looking for platonic or online only or who don't look like their pictures. And an SB who views me as a walking ATM and thinks in terms of dollars per hour is no different to me than an SD who views his SB as a sex doll. We are not ATMs and sex dolls. Nor are we client and provider. We are human beings looking for some form of romantic relationship that includes financial support. An SB shouldn't be expected to be perfectly made up and sexually available at an SDs whim when they are together, like an escort would be. An SD isn't going to want to pay by the hour or feel like they are on the clock, like a john would be. That doesn't mean platonic on the one hand and vanilla on the other, it simply means sugar is a distinct thing in the middle of the spectrum between those two extremes and you can't usually apply escorting or vanilla standards to sugar dating. \n\nObviously you're free to disagree with me, but I don't see the need to be insulting and dismissive.",

It is her job, its nothing more or less than that, and she will charge what will make it worthwhile to have sex with total strangers many of whom she is completely repulsed by. There is no expectation that a client will make conversation for days ahead of time and schedule a platonic M&G to make sure there's mutual attraction. There is no expectation that a client will provide gifts or dinners. There is no expectation of emotional support from a client. That is all a non-factor. The rates and screening protocols in the US are also much higher due to law enforcement risks that do not exist in sugaring. \n\nIf I understand your logic a vanilla relationship would be even more 'disgraceful' because there is even more emotional connection and less allowance. I just don't see it that way. The emotional connection and attention is a two way street. I'm offering something within my budget that I view as generous and know is in line with what others are offering and accepting in my city. I'm looking for something that is almost identical to casual or serious vanilla dating PLUS a significant amount of direct financial support. That seems like a good deal to me and a lot different from an escort/client relationship. Anyone who isn't happy with that is free to keep looking, no hard feelings, but hardly seems like 'salt' to me.",

The money just helps bridge the gap in terms of age, availability (as lots of SDs are married), etc.\n\nIf you want to maximise profit, that\u2019s fine, there\u2019s no rulebook on how to do this, but there are people with also legitimate relationships that will have a different, equally valid, point of view.\n\nFWIW my usual SBs would not be comfortable getting paid escort rates as that conveys a set of expectations they are not ready to fulfil.",

And an SB who views me as a walking ATM and thinks in terms of dollars per hour is no different to me than an SD who views his SB as a sex doll. We are not ATMs and sex dolls. Nor are we client and provider. We are human beings looking for some form of romantic relationship that includes financial support. An SB shouldn't be expected to be perfectly made up and sexually available at an SDs whim when they are together, like an escort would be. An SD isn't going to want to pay by the hour or feel like they are on the clock, like a john would be. That doesn't mean platonic on the one hand and vanilla on the other, it simply means sugar is a distinct thing in the middle of the spectrum between those two extremes and you can't usually apply escorting or vanilla standards to sugar dating. \n\nObviously you're free to disagree with me, but I don't see the need to be insulting and dismissive.",

I do believe, however, that the money is a primary motivating factor for nearly every SB out there. \n\nSure your advice can be helpful, and it\u2019s nice when you provide emotional support, but would she stay with you if you stopped taking her out to fabulous places, stopped spoiling her, and stopped offering her an allowance or PPM? Let\u2019s keep it real, Daddy! \n\nLikewise, would you continue to offer any form of support if she told you that as of July 1st she will no longer be offering any form of sex- no BJ, no intercourse, nothing??\n\nFWIW, I\u2019m fairly certain your usual SBs would be just fine if you continued on as you always have, but you just started giving them way more money.",

What I meant and should have said is I can't wrap my head around how someone could be so tone deaf as to compare only getting offered $x by a POT as a PPM when you think $y is a more fair offer to BLM. You need to take a step back. We're all (SDs and SBs) dealing with a ton of time wasters and BS on SA right now and I get that's frustrating. But come on. We aren't talking about a life or death issue here. There is room for people to have different points of view and be looking for different things.",

It implies SBs are being systemically oppressed or wronged by \"salt daddies\" and that my comments undermine SBs and enable these \"salt daddies.\" An SD who is offering less than you want is an annoyance, nothing more, and is no different from the annoyance us SDs feel when bombarded with SBs looking for platonic or online only or who don't look like their pictures. And an SB who views me as a walking ATM and thinks in terms of dollars per hour is no different to me than an SD who views his SB as a sex doll. We are not ATMs and sex dolls. Nor are we client and provider. We are human beings looking for some form of romantic relationship that includes financial support. An SB shouldn't be expected to be perfectly made up and sexually available at an SDs whim when they are together, like an escort would be. An SD isn't going to want to pay by the hour or feel like they are on the clock, like a john would be. That doesn't mean platonic on the one hand and vanilla on the other, it simply means sugar is a distinct thing in the middle of the spectrum between those two extremes and you can't usually apply escorting or vanilla standards to sugar dating. \n\nObviously you're free to disagree with me, but I don't see the need to be insulting and dismissive.",

It implies SBs are being systemically oppressed or wronged by \"salt daddies\" and that my comments undermine SBs and enable these \"salt daddies.\" An SD who is offering less than you want is an annoyance, nothing more, and is no different from the annoyance us SDs feel when bombarded with SBs looking for platonic or online only or who don't look like their pictures. And an SB who views me as a walking ATM and thinks in terms of dollars per hour is no different to me than an SD who views his SB as a sex doll. We are not ATMs and sex dolls. Nor are we client and provider. We are human beings looking for some form of romantic relationship that includes financial support. An SB shouldn't be expected to be perfectly made up and sexually available at an SDs whim when they are together, like an escort would be. An SD isn't going to want to pay by the hour or feel like they are on the clock, like a john would be. That doesn't mean platonic on the one hand and vanilla on the other, it simply means sugar is a distinct thing in the middle of the spectrum between those two extremes and you can't usually apply escorting or vanilla standards to sugar dating. \n\nObviously you're free to disagree with me, but I don't see the need to be insulting and dismissive.",
