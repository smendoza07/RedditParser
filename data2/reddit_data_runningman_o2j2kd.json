All of these seem to be a \"this is what these celebrities like to order at McDonald's\" thing. I have no idea how true that might be, but there isn't much special about the actual food.\n\nIt makes less sense with BTS, though. Are they trying to suggest that all of the members of BTS like to order the same thing at McDonald's?\n\nI don't know. Maybe it's McNuggets because the group's training regimen only allows them to have a single chicken nugget each as their junk food allowance, so they split the one meal together ;)\n\nEdit: Apparently, they did do something new for the BTS meal. It has two new dipping sauces - Sweet Chili and Cajun. So that's something, at least.",

All of these seem to be a \"this is what these celebrities like to order at McDonald's\" thing. I have no idea how true that might be, but there isn't much special about the actual food.\n\nIt makes less sense with BTS, though. Are they trying to suggest that all of the members of BTS like to order the same thing at McDonald's?\n\nI don't know. Maybe it's McNuggets because the group's training regimen only allows them to have a single chicken nugget each as their junk food allowance, so they split the one meal together ;)\n\nEdit: Apparently, they did do something new for the BTS meal. It has two new dipping sauces - Sweet Chili and Cajun. So that's something, at least.",
