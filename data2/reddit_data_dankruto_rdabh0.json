Do you understand what level of trauma this induces on him. He must've felt like everyone closer to him would end up dying. Think about how tsunade( princess of konoha) ended up before she met Naruto. He trusted the hokage and the village to take care of Naruto who is the son of fourth hokage. Not to mention he is definitely one of the least qualified to take care if a kid. \n\nI do agree that he definitely should have done a better job.

This shows that not only was Naruto's case actually far from something unknown, it is the same situation as his mom's except far less attention and care and proper treatment was given, making Hiruzen seem incompetent.\n\nMeanwhile Jiraiya gets handwaved because at least him keeping an eye out for orochimaru and the Akatsuki does check out, and Jiraiya is shown being on much better terms with Naruto in a shorter amount of time than Hiruzen was shown to be with Naruto.",

First training and my boy had evolved enough to beat Neji and Gaara, the most talented Genins at the time, on the same day. He found a father in him. Jiraiya would take him on missions, teach him techniques, buy him clothes and everything. Yeah, Iruka had already been a father and yes, he had many friends. But his connection to Ero sennin was moee than special. What did Hiruzen do? Nothing. Two boys victims of tragic events. You're the Hokage. Naruto is being bullied and all. First of all, how the hell did the village know that Naruto had 9 tails in him when even himself didn't. That could and should have been a state secret. Whatever...",

Do you understand what level of trauma this induces on him. He must've felt like everyone closer to him would end up dying. Think about how tsunade( princess of konoha) ended up before she met Naruto. He trusted the hokage and the village to take care of Naruto who is the son of fourth hokage. Not to mention he is definitely one of the least qualified to take care if a kid. \n\nI do agree that he definitely should have done a better job.

First training and my boy had evolved enough to beat Neji and Gaara, the most talented Genins at the time, on the same day. He found a father in him. Jiraiya would take him on missions, teach him techniques, buy him clothes and everything. Yeah, Iruka had already been a father and yes, he had many friends. But his connection to Ero sennin was moee than special. What did Hiruzen do? Nothing. Two boys victims of tragic events. You're the Hokage. Naruto is being bullied and all.

Think about how tsunade( princess of konoha) ended up before she met Naruto. He trusted the hokage and the village to take care of Naruto who is the son of fourth hokage. Not to mention he is definitely one of the least qualified to take care if a kid. \n\nI do agree that he definitely should have done a better job.

First training and my boy had evolved enough to beat Neji and Gaara, the most talented Genins at the time, on the same day. He found a father in him. Jiraiya would take him on missions, teach him techniques, buy him clothes and everything. Yeah, Iruka had already been a father and yes, he had many friends. But his connection to Ero sennin was moee than special. What did Hiruzen do? Nothing. Two boys victims of tragic events. You're the Hokage. Naruto is being bullied and all.
