Although your curls are rockin, maybe one day they\u2019ll be gone, or a hair product is out there that might slow down hair loss, or one day you might get something similar to plugs\u2026 you are still gonna be handsome. I don\u2019t know what sex your interested in\u2026 but only shallow people you wouldn\u2019t want in your life would give a shit about something that from the outside perspective is minute. I don\u2019t mean to downplay something that bothers you about your appearance, but you have so much going for you beyond your hairline. I know you seek advice, and I answered w a pep talk. I have no idea why Reddit even suggested this subreddit, maybe because I\u2019m in r/curlyhair? Enjoy the day.",

The earlier you start, the better results you get. Unfortunately for me, finasteride is only available to treat prostate problems, so no doctor will ever prescribe it for me for hair loss reasons, I had to find something else. Here in Hungary, sabal (saw palmetto) is available without prescription, and it targets the same hormone DHT that causes prostate problems and balding (receding hairline) (which is also the hormone that finasteride is good against). I started taking it a month ago, and I haven't experienced anything yet. The pills I take also contain pumpkin seed oil. \n\ntldr; finasteride or sabal (saw palmetto) can be used to counteract a receding hairline",

From what I read for beards at least people who used minoxidil for at least a year an a half were able to \"teach\" there bodies to keep their hair if they stopped using it or cut back.

You may very well see changes in your hairline and hair texture as you hit your mid to late 20s due to changes in hormone levels (testosterone) that occur at that point as you fully mature and your body no longer needs those levels of testosterone for development. That doesn\u2019t look like recession to me at all but just check for changes occasionally and document with pictures in similar lighting and angles.",

No one should feel bad for it. That said, you have a full head of hair, plus it\u2019s curly. So you\u2019re winning pretty well for the most part. And even if you cut it short, a receding hairline actually looks pretty well while it\u2019s still on the front half of your head with a nice beard too. So don\u2019t worry, yaknow. Just embrace where you\u2019re at. I\u2019m sure most of us on here all have the exact same problems. My hairline around my temples are going straight too, but since my hair is growing out it\u2019s not so noticeable and I don\u2019t mind it. 24 here. Hope it helps anyways^ keep doing you",

My halftime looks more of a combination of both (my left temple is a little higher but my right is perfect square). So this could be an inconstancy for you. Plus having hair longer than 6 inches starts to define your hair and shows more inconsistencies in it. That aside your hair looks great bro, I would say just take some finasteride if you see any sight of recession or you can start now as long as your above 18 (because FDS and side effects it could have on you) but finasteride is good for your body overall. I take finasteride but I don\u2019t have a receding hairline, I just take it more so for prevention. But I\u2019m not getting any negative feedback at all from it, so I\u2019m going to continue taking it, but that may not apply to everyone.",
