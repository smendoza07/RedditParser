Seems like it'd be worthwhile just to keep those people out of their life.\n\nIMO the whole pedophile mustache idea is some old 90s homophobia. Gay men have pretty much always had what a lot of straight people refer to as a \"pedo stache\", and homophobic people have always called gay men child predators.\n\nIf you're really worried about pedophiles, most child molestation comes from close family members, not strangers with mustaches.",
