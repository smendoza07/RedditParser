Naruto is fucking over powered, like you can't even think how overpowered he is, kakashi is a jounin and he says that he can use chidori which is basically a nerfed rasengan (focusing more on nature than form) four times a day whereas naruto spams rasengan like it's not even making his balls itch.\n\nHe then goes on to beat fucking Garra, while its true that kurama gave him some chakra, it was not even one tail worth, like there's is barely even a cloak and he beat a biiju.",

The \"multi\" argument doesn't make any sense because there is no such thing in the original version.

In fact,\u00a0Konohagakure's\u00a0Ninja Academy\u00a0prevents students from graduating unless they master this technique, for which reason\u00a0Naruto Uzumaki\u00a0failed three years in a row. For this technique, users create one or more afterimages of themselves to move alongside them. Unlike most other\u00a0clone techniques, these afterimages have no substance and thus are incapable of damaging opponents. Because of this, it is only useful for confusing enemies while other attacks are prepared.\"",

For this technique, users create one or more afterimages of themselves to move alongside them. Unlike most other\u00a0clone techniques, these afterimages have no substance and thus are incapable of damaging opponents. Because of this, it is only useful for confusing enemies while other attacks are prepared.\"",

The \"multi\" argument doesn't make any sense because there is no such thing in the original version.

For this technique, users create one or more afterimages of themselves to move alongside them. Unlike most other\u00a0clone techniques, these afterimages have no substance and thus are incapable of damaging opponents.

For this technique, users create one or more afterimages of themselves to move alongside them. Unlike most other\u00a0clone techniques, these afterimages have no substance and thus are incapable of damaging opponents. Because of this, it is only useful for confusing enemies while other attacks are prepared.\"",
