The whole point of Pain\u2019s edge was that if your flight all 6 at once you\u2019d be fucked cause Nagato is controlling them from far away. So this was VITAL information to understanding how to defeat Pain. Jiraiya NEEDED to do this before he died and in a way that Pain couldn\u2019t tell it was giving away his vital secret. It wasn\u2019t just plot. He gave his life for this info.",

This matters because if Pain knew Naruto knew the truth during their fight, he wouldn't have sacrificed his different paths the way he did and his entire fighting style would've changed.\n\nThe advantage of knowing your opponents jutsu/strategy is absolutely key in a shinobi fight. The same way Obito could abuse his intangiblity until the war where he realized they knew the truth and could counter it (Kakashi being in the other dimension thanks to Kurama for example).",

Martin had a lot of his edge, he didn\u2019t allow his characters to finish their own Arc. But allowed their death to jump start the character progression of another lesser character, ie Ned\u2019s death leading to the jumpstart of Rob and Arya.",

It feels more real when you don\u2019t get closure because in real life people don\u2019t finish their arcs all the time. For example: you have a friend who\u2019s doing well recovering from some horrible situation and he gets run over by a car. It\u2019s a very sad but real situation. It may be bleak but it makes for more relatable story. I like that jiraya finished his arc, too, but GoT was so good because people just died",

The concept of a godfather doesn\u2019t exist in Japan, Minato was talking about something different. But the closest word for the term used in the manga that English readers would understand is godfather, hence the beginning of the myth.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s not that illogical to think that Jiraiya wouldn\u2019t want to give potentially useless info to Fukasaku, especially considering he was planning on escaping not sacrificing himself right then and there.",

We see it as Pain being cold and just staring at him. But I think there is more happening behind the scenes. We weren't made privy to it (by inserting a cutscene of Nagato hesitating or something) to keep some of the mystery around the Pains. On screen Yahiko Pain's face is emotionless because Nagato doesn't really waste energy on meaningless emotions on a dead puppets face. The only time we see any kind of emotion on their faces is in the Pain V Naruto (6 tails cloak i think) when they changed the animation style for Planetary Devestation. And that was really only him yelling. No sadness or joy or anything past tensing up for fighting really.",

This matters because if Pain knew Naruto knew the truth during their fight, he wouldn't have sacrificed his different paths the way he did and his entire fighting style would've changed.\n\nThe advantage of knowing your opponents jutsu/strategy is absolutely key in a shinobi fight. The same way Obito could abuse his intangiblity until the war where he realized they knew the truth and could counter it (Kakashi being in the other dimension thanks to Kurama for example).",

It feels more real when you don\u2019t get closure because in real life people don\u2019t finish their arcs all the time. For example: you have a friend who\u2019s doing well recovering from some horrible situation and he gets run over by a car. It\u2019s a very sad but real situation. It may be bleak but it makes for more relatable story. I like that jiraya finished his arc, too, but GoT was so good because people just died",

But I think there is more happening behind the scenes. We weren't made privy to it (by inserting a cutscene of Nagato hesitating or something) to keep some of the mystery around the Pains. On screen Yahiko Pain's face is emotionless because Nagato doesn't really waste energy on meaningless emotions on a dead puppets face. The only time we see any kind of emotion on their faces is in the Pain V Naruto (6 tails cloak i think) when they changed the animation style for Planetary Devestation. And that was really only him yelling. No sadness or joy or anything past tensing up for fighting really.",

The same way Obito could abuse his intangiblity until the war where he realized they knew the truth and could counter it (Kakashi being in the other dimension thanks to Kurama for example).",

It feels more real when you don\u2019t get closure because in real life people don\u2019t finish their arcs all the time. For example: you have a friend who\u2019s doing well recovering from some horrible situation and he gets run over by a car. It\u2019s a very sad but real situation. It may be bleak but it makes for more relatable story. I like that jiraya finished his arc, too, but GoT was so good because people just died",

This matters because if Pain knew Naruto knew the truth during their fight, he wouldn't have sacrificed his different paths the way he did and his entire fighting style would've changed.\n\nThe advantage of knowing your opponents jutsu/strategy is absolutely key in a shinobi fight. The same way Obito could abuse his intangiblity until the war where he realized they knew the truth and could counter it (Kakashi being in the other dimension thanks to Kurama for example).",

The same way Obito could abuse his intangiblity until the war where he realized they knew the truth and could counter it (Kakashi being in the other dimension thanks to Kurama for example).",

If you want to say he *should\u2019ve* taken care of Naruto, I would agree, but that\u2019s not what you said. You are specifically trying to push the point that Jiraiya is a bad godfather. I also don\u2019t remember Naruto hating the world. He understood that everyone in the village hated him, and pulled pranks in retaliation to his treatment, but young Naruto didn\u2019t really anyone or anything besides maybe Sasuke.",

He did not abandon Naruto because he did not have the obligation to instruct or take care of Naruto that you think he does. If you want to say he *should\u2019ve* taken care of Naruto, I would agree, but that\u2019s not what you said. You are specifically trying to push the point that Jiraiya is a bad godfather. I also don\u2019t remember Naruto hating the world. He understood that everyone in the village hated him, and pulled pranks in retaliation to his treatment, but young Naruto didn\u2019t really anyone or anything besides maybe Sasuke.",
