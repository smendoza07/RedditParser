    "body": "Just saw a 17 year old daughter of a friend come up on SA. I know she is not 18 because her mother makes a huge deal about birthday parties and I've seen every single one for the last 12 years on my facebook. With an adult sugaring might eek out some gray zone but with a minor? No you are going to be introducing yourself to your neighbors as a sex offender for the rest of your life. Stay safe out there!",

There isn\u2019t really a significant cognitive difference between being 17 and 11 months, or even 17 years and 364 days, and being 18 in terms of maturity and ability to navigate something like sugaring. HOWEVER obviously society had to draw the line somewhere, eighteen is that line, and out of respect for others one should not cross that line in a way that could affect another person (I.e. SA, especially in places where age of consent laws are 18+)",

Obviously didn\u2019t join SA until after my eighteenth birthday, because I\u2019m not an asshat, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with being informed when you\u2019re very close to being eighteen I don\u2019t think. There isn\u2019t really a significant cognitive difference between being 17 and 11 months, or even 17 years and 364 days, and being 18 in terms of maturity and ability to navigate something like sugaring. HOWEVER obviously society had to draw the line somewhere, eighteen is that line, and out of respect for others one should not cross that line in a way that could affect another person (I.e. SA, especially in places where age of consent laws are 18+)",

Visual depictions include photographs, videos, digital or computer generated images indistinguishable from an actual minor, and images created, adapted, or modified, but appear to depict an identifiable, actual minor. \n\nNotably, the legal definition of sexually explicit conduct does not require that an image depict a child engaging in sexual activity.  A picture of a naked child may constitute illegal child pornography if it is sufficiently sexually suggestive.  Additionally, the age of consent for sexual activity in a given state is irrelevant;",

Visual depictions include photographs, videos, digital or computer generated images indistinguishable from an actual minor, and images created, adapted, or modified, but appear to depict an identifiable, actual minor. \n\nNotably, the legal definition of sexually explicit conduct does not require that an image depict a child engaging in sexual activity.  A picture of a naked child may constitute illegal child pornography if it is sufficiently sexually suggestive.  Additionally, the age of consent for sexual activity in a given state is irrelevant;",
