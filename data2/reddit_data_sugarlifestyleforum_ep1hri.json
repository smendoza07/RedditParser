    "body": "I live in a country where health care is pretty elaborate. Different governmentally funded organisations are being really pushy about people checking their STD's and it's free and it's easy and there are clinics everywhere you can do it.\n\nSoo I went into one, like I've done before. The waiting hall is full of teenagers wanting that free chlamydia test or IUD or whatever. They always want you to fill out a form and you have to answer yes or no to the following questions:\n\n\n- have you slept with someone new during the last four weeks?\n- have you slept with Gay men?\n- have you slept with gay women?\n- have you received anal sex?\n- have you sold/traded sex or slept with someone who buys/trades sex?\n\n\nI know these questions were coming, this ain't my first rodeo. But it was the first time I answered 'yes' to the last question. And it's weird to admit, but in certain SR's I've really felt that I'm selling sex. And no matter what I wanted to tell myself in the beginning, I do feel that sugaring is a type of sex work. I am definitely sure that one of my SD's have been with a traditional escort before, anyways.\n\n\nAnyhow.. I got called in to the nurses office, and she was really nice. She asked me the same questions again, and asked about what tests I wanted to do. Because I answered yes to sexwork, that puts me in a category of people who can get free Hep B vaccine. She also did my bloodwork, swabbed my throat, and I got to swab my own vagina in the bathroom. She asked if someone was pushing me to do sexwork, and of course I answered no. But I'm glad that she did :)\n\n\nI don't really have a purpose with this post. I definitely don't want to start the old \"sugaring vs escorting\" discussion. But I dunno... this lifestyle has shaped me in a lot of ways, and I don't really have a place to vent about this. The appointment just really stuck with me. In a good way! Anyone had similar experiences?",

The questionnaire asks whether I have been with someone who traded sex for money, and I always answer no. Not for deep philosophical reasons, but because I am wary of admitting that to the government, and I'm not confident it will remain confidential. Germs don't care about money, so I see the question as irrelevant. I do wonder now whether I would get extra services if I said yes.",

Anyone had similar experiences?\n\nI'm glad that you live in a place where the views on sex work is more progressive than the US. Quite unfortunately, US seems to have regressed further lately with the SESTA/FOTSA. All I'm seeing is that these laws have strengthened the hands of pimps than save anyone. I wish things were different here.\n\nI don't see the sugaring vs escorting debate going away anytime soon ... :) Wonder if it'll ever make it mainstream like the old debate about \"pornography or art\". A civil debate is never a bad thing.",

How about obstetrics, is that sex work. \"men use the word sexwoek to lower...\"  Really, some men perhaps but I don't. Maybe we should use the word professional, as in the oldest. I'm sure most consider the working girls at the Bunny Ranch to be professionals. Surely hardly any SB can be considered a professional. Sexwork is neither ameliorative or pejorative, unless sex is. That's our problem, too many individuals in our culture consider sex in a bad light. It just happens to be one of our primary motivations you dirty animals.",
