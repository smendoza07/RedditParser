It's almost all digital now :(\n\nCheap game pass programs like microsoft's $2/month stuff is the best we've got now. Eventually you run out of games though. Some services offer seasonal passes but it's not the same as just having the complete game and a day off to try and beat it.\n\nEdit: I remember when I was a young girl and loved halo. When halo 4 came out I got the special edition and beat it in a few hours. I was so dissapointed. I wish I could have rented the game instead. Halo reach beta on odst was peak for me. The official release felt so bad and halo 4 was the absolute nail in the coffin for me for so many reasons.",

It's almost all digital now :(\n\nCheap game pass programs like microsoft's $2/month stuff is the best we've got now. Eventually you run out of games though. Some services offer seasonal passes but it's not the same as just having the complete game and a day off to try and beat it.\n\nEdit: I remember when I was a young girl and loved halo. When halo 4 came out I got the special edition and beat it in a few hours. I was so dissapointed. I wish I could have rented the game instead. Halo reach beta on odst was peak for me. The official release felt so bad and halo 4 was the absolute nail in the coffin for me for so many reasons.",
