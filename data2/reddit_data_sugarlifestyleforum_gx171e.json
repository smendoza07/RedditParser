    "body": "So another week of massive sorting through the online only and scammers messages and it's late at night and I decide to entertain two of the messages at the same time... Half hoping one may actually be legitimate but also knowing this is gonna be a joke and of course it was but I figured it'll be fun to see what tactics they will use. The first one claimed she's out of country with family due to covid but will be returning for school in August and was probably convinced she had me when we exchanged snapchats in which i ask for a selfie with a \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4d and of course she sends nudes upon nudes to distract from the truth but the non nude thumbs up photo I ask for doesn't come and after a couple hrs \ud83d\ude06 finally gets frustrated and claims I'm wasting their time and probably stealing the pics in which I respond snap obviously shows no screenshots or saving happened. Still can't believe I was able to string em along for that long.\nBuuuut the second one takes the cake... We move the chat to Kik in which I again ask for the quick non nude \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4d pic and they send several other photos whilst also saying they can't do a thumbs up \ud83d\ude06 eventually what's pictured below happens... \n\n (http://imgur.com/a/gTQ1NwJ)",
