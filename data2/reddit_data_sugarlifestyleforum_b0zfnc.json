    "body": "For all of the newbies out there trying to get started.  Just be patient. It took me months to find someone. I got off the site, deleted everything, and then months later got back on... I finally met someone on tinder. And he is amazing. \nI am beyond happy and words can't express how amazing last night was. \nWe had dinner at a wonderful steakhouse, and then he decided to go shopping! We had been talking about Kate Spade handbags and I told him I didn't know anything about designer anything! So he's like oh my goodness let's go. Lol \n\nSo We head into the sunglasses store because he asked if I had any and I'm like well... $5 ones... I mean these are probably crazy expensive. \nHe's like let's go .. lol.. so we go in and he tells the sales associate that I can get whatever I want, so she of course ushers me to the high end glasses haha \nFirst pair I picked up, I was in love = Prada ... Never had anything Prada in my life! \u2764\ufe0f I'm SO excited to wear them!\n(I hope that girl helping us got commission cuz she was a sweetheart) \n\nThe night continued and he got me two beautiful Ann Taylor dresses, a Vera Bradley bag to carry my hospital clinical stuff in and got me a Kate Spade handbag (with two wallets \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f) \n- two because I wanted black to have with everything and I spotted the gorgeous blue one while he was checking out and he's like bring it here :) \n\nKeep your head up newbies. They are real SDs and real arrangements. It just takes time to find them! \n\nTL;DR \nSD took me shopping and I have no one to excitedly tell this stuff too!! First designer stuff in my life \ud83d\ude0d",

On our second date (this was about 5 years ago), I took her shopping because she was really short on clothing.  One of the things I bought for her was a designer coat and she cried because she'd never owned anything like that.  She would get so excited when people at her school would comment on how nice her coat was. \n\nAs a SD, it's extremely satisfying and validating to bring that kind of excitement into a woman's life.  Congrats on finding a good one!\n\n&#x200B;",
