I accept that she saved naruto **but** she's called useless not because she's a medic ninja....it's because being Tsunade's student and getting 100 healings mark (somehow), still she couldn't do anything.......while tsunade was known for grabbing the main limelight in 2nd ninja war with Orochimaru and Jiraiya.......but Sakura did was not even able be a diversion so that Naruto and Sasuke can actually attack Madara.....\n4. when obito saved sasuke with sakura's chakra..........yeah it was all because of sakura's chakra **but** if instead of sakura, there was any other girl/guy.........like Hinata, or Ino.....even they could've done that, even better.......and reason why she was there was because sasuke's sussano saved her from mugen tsukuyomi (I wonder about the spelling)\n5. I wonder what if Hinata was there......she could've just beatent the shit out of Kaguya with **64 palms,** even Ino could've stopped her with **mind transfer.**....but keep defending Sakura ( now I wonder Sakura actually isn't that useless)\n6. Well my username itself Says no\\_substance so you can make me shut but you cannot stop 90% of naruto fans and can't change the fact that other characters got more **character development** (except Tenten) and are **better** than Sakura\n7. Also not to mention what could've been more useful when she could've just taken out the rinnegan from Obito's eyes when obito asked her and placed in her own eyes, because she was a medic ninja, she could've protected both Obito and Rinnegan and being a professional Medic ninja.......she could've done that in seconds.......well because of that she could've been more usefull than Kakashi himself.........but no she hesitated......when there was no point of Hesitation, even Rin didn't hesitate in transporting Obito's eyes to Kakashi..........she's dumb",

Kalashi was known as Kakashi of The Sharingan, Cold Blooded Killer, Copy Ninja, Son of The White Fang. \n\nHis father was The White Fang, his sensei was The Yellow Flash, His anbu friend Itachi was known as the master of genjutsu. He never really had a nickname given to him though i guess. Gai was given the Blue Beast of the Leaf and in the war arc he was given the Red Beast title. \n\nBut, ppl who came after Kakashis generation did have some cool names. Naruto did not, they called him the Knucklehead ninja which is acc is more comedic than badass but its cool too. They called him the Orange Hokage now, not so great. Sasuke had a cool one. The Last Uchiha. Sakura?......anyways. Neji was known as The Genius. Thats a cool title. He was a prodigy in gentle fist after all. Hinata was the Princess of The Byakugan. Gaara was known as Gaara of the sand. That is fire. Just saying it even in japanese. Sabaku no Gaara. And then theres Jiraya. The Toad Sage! Kinda cool and funny. Perhaps in boruto we will see some cool nicknames. \n\n- Boruto of the Jougan\n- Mitsuki The Dragon Sage. \n- Sarada The Princess of the Sharingan \n- Himawari The Princess of the Hyuuga. \n\nU never know. These are just some ideas lol",

I accept that she saved naruto **but** she's called useless not because she's a medic ninja....it's because being Tsunade's student and getting 100 healings mark (somehow), still she couldn't do anything.......while tsunade was known for grabbing the main limelight in 2nd ninja war with Orochimaru and Jiraiya.......but Sakura did was not even able be a diversion so that Naruto and Sasuke can actually attack Madara.....\n4. when obito saved sasuke with sakura's chakra..........yeah it was all because of sakura's chakra **but** if instead of sakura, there was any other girl/guy.........like Hinata, or Ino.....even they could've done that, even better.......and reason why she was there was because sasuke's sussano saved her from mugen tsukuyomi (I wonder about the spelling)\n5. I wonder what if Hinata was there......she could've just beatent the shit out of Kaguya with **64 palms,** even Ino could've stopped her with **mind transfer.**....but keep defending Sakura ( now I wonder Sakura actually isn't that useless)\n6. Well my username itself Says no\\_substance so you can make me shut but you cannot stop 90% of naruto fans and can't change the fact that other characters got more **character development** (except Tenten) and are **better** than Sakura\n7. Also not to mention what could've been more useful when she could've just taken out the rinnegan from Obito's eyes when obito asked her and placed in her own eyes, because she was a medic ninja, she could've protected both Obito and Rinnegan and being a professional Medic ninja.......she could've done that in seconds.......well because of that she could've been more usefull than Kakashi himself.........but no she hesitated......when there was no point of Hesitation, even Rin didn't hesitate in transporting Obito's eyes to Kakashi..........she's dumb",

Hiruzen and Danzo. More loosly defined we can use even other dynamics like Jiraya for Tsunade or Guy for Kakashi. \n\nThe Shadow Hokage is cool but less unique than \u201cThe Last Uchiha\u201d which he was given in Shippuden",

I accept that she saved naruto **but** she's called useless not because she's a medic ninja....it's because being Tsunade's student and getting 100 healings mark (somehow), still she couldn't do anything.......while tsunade was known for grabbing the main limelight in 2nd ninja war with Orochimaru and Jiraiya.......but Sakura did was not even able be a diversion so that Naruto and Sasuke can actually attack Madara.....\n4. when obito saved sasuke with sakura's chakra..........yeah it was all because of sakura's chakra **but** if instead of sakura, there was any other girl/guy.........like Hinata, or Ino.....even they could've done that, even better.......and reason why she was there was because sasuke's sussano saved her from mugen tsukuyomi (I wonder about the spelling)\n5. I wonder what if Hinata was there......she could've just beatent the shit out of Kaguya with **64 palms,** even Ino could've stopped her with **mind transfer.**....but keep defending Sakura ( now I wonder Sakura actually isn't that useless)\n6. Well my username itself Says no\\_substance so you can make me shut but you cannot stop 90% of naruto fans and can't change the fact that other characters got more **character development** (except Tenten) and are **better** than Sakura\n7. Also not to mention what could've been more useful when she could've just taken out the rinnegan from Obito's eyes when obito asked her and placed in her own eyes, because she was a medic ninja, she could've protected both Obito and Rinnegan and being a professional Medic ninja.......she could've done that in seconds.......well because of that she could've been more usefull than Kakashi himself.........but no she hesitated......when there was no point of Hesitation, even Rin didn't hesitate in transporting Obito's eyes to Kakashi..........she's dumb",

I accept that she saved naruto **but** she's called useless not because she's a medic ninja....it's because being Tsunade's student and getting 100 healings mark (somehow), still she couldn't do anything.......while tsunade was known for grabbing the main limelight in 2nd ninja war with Orochimaru and Jiraiya.......but Sakura did was not even able be a diversion so that Naruto and Sasuke can actually attack Madara.....\n4. when obito saved sasuke with sakura's chakra..........yeah it was all because of sakura's chakra **but** if instead of sakura, there was any other girl/guy.........like Hinata, or Ino.....even they could've done that, even better.......and reason why she was there was because sasuke's sussano saved her from mugen tsukuyomi (I wonder about the spelling)\n5. I wonder what if Hinata was there......she could've just beatent the shit out of Kaguya with **64 palms,** even Ino could've stopped her with **mind transfer.**....but keep defending Sakura ( now I wonder Sakura actually isn't that useless)\n6. Well my username itself Says no\\_substance so you can make me shut but you cannot stop 90% of naruto fans and can't change the fact that other characters got more **character development** (except Tenten) and are **better** than Sakura\n7. Also not to mention what could've been more useful when she could've just taken out the rinnegan from Obito's eyes when obito asked her and placed in her own eyes, because she was a medic ninja, she could've protected both Obito and Rinnegan and being a professional Medic ninja.......she could've done that in seconds.......well because of that she could've been more usefull than Kakashi himself.........but no she hesitated......when there was no point of Hesitation, even Rin didn't hesitate in transporting Obito's eyes to Kakashi..........she's dumb",

The other \"shadow hokages\" are when fans went like \"okay yeah so that's like madara for hashirama, jiraiya for tsuna, etc\", there's even debate on whether sarutobi's shadow was danzo, as if we use the sasuke analogy and why naruto calls him that, the shado hokage is someone who protects the village from the outside while the hokage stays in the village, in that case it would make more sense to call itachi sarutobi's shadow.",

I'm 21 ( I watch Naruto since 2013 when it used to come on tv, my country India, channel Animax)\n2. it wasn't cute when your teamates are getting character development andyou're just crying for sasuke's return......\n3. I accept that she saved naruto **but** she's called useless not because she's a medic ninja....it's because being Tsunade's student and getting 100 healings mark (somehow), still she couldn't do anything.......while tsunade was known for grabbing the main limelight in 2nd ninja war with Orochimaru and Jiraiya.......but Sakura did was not even able be a diversion so that Naruto and Sasuke can actually attack Madara.....\n4. when obito saved sasuke with sakura's chakra..........yeah it was all because of sakura's chakra **but** if instead of sakura, there was any other girl/guy.........like Hinata, or Ino.....even they could've done that, even better.......and reason why she was there was because sasuke's sussano saved her from mugen tsukuyomi (I wonder about the spelling)\n5. I wonder what if Hinata was there......she could've just beatent the shit out of Kaguya with **64 palms,** even Ino could've stopped her with **mind transfer.**....but keep defending Sakura ( now I wonder Sakura actually isn't that useless)\n6. Well my username itself Says no\\_substance so you can make me shut but you cannot stop 90% of naruto fans and can't change the fact that other characters got more **character development** (except Tenten) and are **better** than Sakura\n7. Also not to mention what could've been more useful when she could've just taken out the rinnegan from Obito's eyes when obito asked her and placed in her own eyes, because she was a medic ninja, she could've protected both Obito and Rinnegan and being a professional Medic ninja.......she could've done that in seconds.......well because of that she could've been more usefull than Kakashi himself.........but no she hesitated......when there was no point of Hesitation, even Rin didn't hesitate in transporting Obito's eyes to Kakashi..........she's dumb",
