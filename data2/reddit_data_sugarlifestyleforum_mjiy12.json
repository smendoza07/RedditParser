    "body": "Sorry this is a bit of a rant, but I just had a text conversation with a POT SD, which was going really well, up until he asked \"are you looking for an 'arrangement'\" to which i replied, yes. And then he says \"ah, i was hoping you were one of the refreshing few on here who aren't looking for money.\" Bitch??!?! That's kind of the point of this website... and i can't help but sense a subtle condescending tone in his reply. Like, how dare I stoop so low as to expect money in a SUGAR relationship. I think what this dude wants is a regular dating app.",

I wish SA was a better place, with better screening criteria for both SDs and SBs to make the tedious process of finding a good match easier.\n\nHowever, there is a selfish part of me that takes pleasure in hearing this. As I have just tried 1 month back on SA, and failed, I think that there is a lesson here.\n\nI'm older, 52, fatter, balder, and paralyzed. So physically, I'm not what any SB wants. I think the \"normal\" SB attempt on SA is to find a guy that they would be with in a vanilla relationship, and to be with him while collecting sugar. These younger, fitter, and more attractive guys statistically do not have the financial resources that older men , such as I have, and try to \"sell\" their youth, physique, and relative attractiveness, as a way to skimp on ppm/allowance.\n\nThere needs to be a reason why he is paying you. If he could date someone similar to you in the vanilla world, then why pay you? The search pattern for SBs should be more on his ability and desire to support you financially than his physical attractiveness.\n\nJust my selfish view.",

They are truly delusional about themselves and expect that they should get the status of a wealthy sugar daddy even though they don't have the track record or resources to provide as one. Studies show this condition has increased from 1-10% of population to even on a spectrum up to 30%. They will throw back at you smart jabs and take the things you say or may even think, without knowing it entirely, they are just guessing, and us it as ammunition for their flame. Which is to be what they are not. Shut them down. As each one of us does it, it takes the air out of their oversized esteem. They are all over the place. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo not, in any circumstance feel bad or let whatever they say get to you. They are the ones that suffer when you don't prove to them they are what they aren't. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck lady!",
