Not to mention he is the \u201creincarnation\u201d of Indra and Masada so he can definitely use it, also he got his Rinnegan directly from the sage of six paths. So the dude can definitely use the abilities because we saw him using the abilities extremely proficiently in the final battles of Shippuden, it\u2019s only in Boruto that he stops using it properly.",

In Naruto, we see Sasuke put all 9 tailed beast and Sakura in a genjutsu right after fighting kaguya along side Naruto, and madara before that. A drained Sasuke with no Chakra was able to summon the cheif snake thing, put him under a genjutsu, go inside him and desummon him, then summon him again near sugetsu. Again, in his words, he was out of Chakra. That's the whole reason he was running away from deidera if im correct. Can't use his renigan twice? Didn't he use it multiple times in the fight with momoshikki and was completely fine? He also used susano. And in the fight with jigen we see that his renigan was still charged so he still had Chakra to use it. Its an honest shame how nerfed Sasuke got",

You can argue that One Piece is older now or airing longer than Naruto but One Piece had great themes, fights, music and World building and what not compared to Naruto. Oda gives side characters we will never see again a nice background Story while we dont see shit in Naruto about the Ambitions of the Konoha 11. Also Power scaling wise Naruto is a clusterfuck of inconsistencies. One piece has its own issues and inconsistencies but Naruto has a lot of plot holes and issues. The biggest thing I dislike is the whole \"I cares for naruto\" stuff when the third Hokage didnt. In Classic Naruto he could use all 5 elements was called the God of Shinobi or something like that while Shippuden showed us that barely anyone has 5 elements. Most have 2 and some have 3 while some actual Geniuses (not prophecy children or Kakashi lol) can use 4 elements (Onoki and his Master dont know his Name rn). We also saw that the first, the second and the fourth Hokage were stronger than him. Also Kakashi being scared of Orochimaru in classic naruto while we saw that he hung out with Itachi in the anbu Corps. The Anbu were inconsistencies too and 99% of characters never got developed past their introduction. Kishimoto shot in his own leg again when he tried to justify naruto trying to save Sasukes emo bitch ass when Rock Lee, Shikamaru and Choji were actual friends and Shikamaru being like an actual brother to him. Also explaining everything that happened with \"actually danzo did it\" and \"hashirama cells lmao\". The whole Clan thing also was hot garbage. He basically fanboyed the Uchihas and their terroristic tendencies and shat on the Senjus whatever the fuck happened to them and basically said \"fuck the uzumakis too\". Naruto never used a single uzumaki technique.",

Early part 1 Naruto but with the characters swapped, b.) Powerscaling: The Series (Suggsverse Shippuden), or c.) Isshiki getting DPed by Naruto and Sasuke for 60 chapters straight while Boruto goes \"woah omg dad ur so cool and ninja I wanna be cool like you and not loser dum like ye OwO\"\n\nSorry if any vitriol leaks out. I'm sure you can understand the built-up frustration from people shitting on things you like every single day like it makes them cool. Personally, I just stick to things I like.

Thousands of clones, truth seeking orbs, multiple rinnegan abilities, clever uses of powers, and other stuff like that. \nThem losing should have been about skill. They should have put everything into the fight and still come up short. Not just in terms of power but in skill. An ancient alien warrior could have had a ton of interesting abilities that would make him a good fight instead of just kicking them around like soccer balls until the nine tails killed itself. \nOne other issue is that all of the coolest moves are given to everyone now. Rinnegan are common so ninjutsu and genjutsu barely matter. Ninjutsu only works as a support technique most of the time since people can just absorb shit. \nI think the absorption should have had some kind of limit. Maybe it has a \u201cdigestion\u201d period. It can absorb a few powerful jutsu but needs time to break the chakra down before it can take more. That way you have to be smart about using it if your opponent is able to use powerful Jutsu. But a weak opponent wouldn\u2019t be able to output enough to cause a problem",

The dead people puppets certainly weren't actual rinnegan users and possessed only 1 of the abilities of the rinnegan each that were being streamed to them by nagato.\n\nMuch like the edo-tensei jinchuriki were not rinnegan users when Kabuto summoned them. \n\nI believe the understanding was that this was a low risk way for nagato to fight that confused enemies with seemingly invincible bodies. Were nagato to fight himself, it's likely that he would not have been as effective because the effects of the rinnegan was taking on a non-native user.\n\nSausage on the other hand is a native user of the rinnegan and should have full control with ease of it. Just like he was able to spam mangekyo sharingan dojutsu that completely gassed kakashi (except the war arc) who was a non native user in one or two shots.\n\nJust to elaborate more, Kakashi was hospitalized at the beginning of naruto as a non native user of the sharingan after 1 fight with a low level jonin assassin. Nothing crazy, yet is shown in his gaiden arc to be using chidori and sharigan left and right over and over. This is inconsistent.\n\nNagato, a non native user (forcefully implanted by madara's schemes) of the rinnegan has such mastery of it that he can apply the six paths of the rinnegan simultaneously  across several bodies over distance and yet it's killing him. He looks like a skeleton. Yet Sausage here can't be shown with one feat of the big R eye except his discount kamui? Bologna and bad writing rampant.\n\n...edit Kebuto did edo tensei, not Boruto",

We can't be sure, but it seems inconsistent with his character. \n\nNot that his character didn't change (i.e he's no longer about destruction but protection) but rather that he was investigating the otsosuki mystery even as early as \"the last.\" Were he wanting to protect, I think it would stand to reason that he'd master one of the most insane powers of all to protect the village he's trying to build.\n\nBut you also bring up the valid point that Sausage only has one rinnegan... which again doesn't really make sense. The idea that the chakra the sage gave him made one eye develop is bizarre and inconsistent. Madara is the only person to develop them naturally outside the original otsosuki, and they both appear at once because his network of chakra now produces the effects to make them. \n\nIf the sage gave him chakra that lasted, both eyes should have developed if not at first then eventually because his *network* of chakra would change his sharingan to a rinnegan (or at least allow him to do it at all like the mangekyo beacuse it's unclear if Madara could turn the rinnegan off like sharingan). If the sage did not give him chakra that lasted, the eye should have gone away like the sealing jutsu's power did because that was like Itachi's (shisui's) dojustsu he placed in Naruto.  \n\nReally the whole show was very backloaded and what ever is convenient at the time for kishi is how it works then, but not later, and it's always got to be bigger and better. I think this is a scope problem, so as to say that the original plot of the show was a short story that he wrote a long time ago with a different setting, and he really only envisioned things up until the chunin exams.\n\nAs much as a I LOVE shippuden and have many many statues of it. It was a continually a bad addition to the storyline each arc. Every arc made less and less sense in the scope of the story and I never felt like I understood more, only had more plot and more plot holes to play with.",

Again, in his words, he was out of Chakra. That's the whole reason he was running away from deidera if im correct. Can't use his renigan twice? Didn't he use it multiple times in the fight with momoshikki and was completely fine? He also used susano.

Sasuke has no excuse though since he's been fighting otsosuki and destroying the remains of kaguya for the last like 13 years.

It was insanely savage the way he used the pull in the final fight. Using those he\u2019d end most fights in seconds. Also, steal some of Madara\u2019s techs. Idk why Boruto makes him look like a chump where he should be a God right now. \n\nNaruto on the other hand looks reasonably powerful, but they should have given him more of Jiraiya\u2019s toad sage jutsus, a few crazy wind techniques (wind bullet? Scythes?). In fact, he knows all natures, give him Sarutobi\u2019s level of knowledge. There\u2019s no way the 2 greatest of all time fought like ants. Especially not the Hokage.",

You can argue that One Piece is older now or airing longer than Naruto but One Piece had great themes, fights, music and World building and what not compared to Naruto. Oda gives side characters we will never see again a nice background Story while we dont see shit in Naruto about the Ambitions of the Konoha 11. Also Power scaling wise Naruto is a clusterfuck of inconsistencies. One piece has its own issues and inconsistencies but Naruto has a lot of plot holes and issues. The biggest thing I dislike is the whole \"I cares for naruto\" stuff when the third Hokage didnt. In Classic Naruto he could use all 5 elements was called the God of Shinobi or something like that while Shippuden showed us that barely anyone has 5 elements. Most have 2 and some have 3 while some actual Geniuses (not prophecy children or Kakashi lol) can use 4 elements (Onoki and his Master dont know his Name rn). We also saw that the first, the second and the fourth Hokage were stronger than him. Also Kakashi being scared of Orochimaru in classic naruto while we saw that he hung out with Itachi in the anbu Corps. The Anbu were inconsistencies too and 99% of characters never got developed past their introduction. Kishimoto shot in his own leg again when he tried to justify naruto trying to save Sasukes emo bitch ass when Rock Lee, Shikamaru and Choji were actual friends and Shikamaru being like an actual brother to him. Also explaining everything that happened with \"actually danzo did it\" and \"hashirama cells lmao\". The whole Clan thing also was hot garbage. He basically fanboyed the Uchihas and their terroristic tendencies and shat on the Senjus whatever the fuck happened to them and basically said \"fuck the uzumakis too\". Naruto never used a single uzumaki technique.",

Early part 1 Naruto but with the characters swapped, b.) Powerscaling: The Series (Suggsverse Shippuden), or c.) Isshiki getting DPed by Naruto and Sasuke for 60 chapters straight while Boruto goes \"woah omg dad ur so cool and ninja I wanna be cool like you and not loser dum like ye OwO\"\n\nSorry if any vitriol leaks out. I'm sure you can understand the built-up frustration from people shitting on things you like every single day like it makes them cool. Personally, I just stick to things I like.

The dead people puppets certainly weren't actual rinnegan users and possessed only 1 of the abilities of the rinnegan each that were being streamed to them by nagato.\n\nMuch like the edo-tensei jinchuriki were not rinnegan users when Kabuto summoned them. \n\nI believe the understanding was that this was a low risk way for nagato to fight that confused enemies with seemingly invincible bodies. Were nagato to fight himself, it's likely that he would not have been as effective because the effects of the rinnegan was taking on a non-native user.\n\nSausage on the other hand is a native user of the rinnegan and should have full control with ease of it. Just like he was able to spam mangekyo sharingan dojutsu that completely gassed kakashi (except the war arc) who was a non native user in one or two shots.\n\nJust to elaborate more, Kakashi was hospitalized at the beginning of naruto as a non native user of the sharingan after 1 fight with a low level jonin assassin. Nothing crazy, yet is shown in his gaiden arc to be using chidori and sharigan left and right over and over. This is inconsistent.\n\nNagato, a non native user (forcefully implanted by madara's schemes) of the rinnegan has such mastery of it that he can apply the six paths of the rinnegan simultaneously  across several bodies over distance and yet it's killing him. He looks like a skeleton. Yet Sausage here can't be shown with one feat of the big R eye except his discount kamui? Bologna and bad writing rampant.\n\n...edit Kebuto did edo tensei, not Boruto",

                            "body": "I would think there's some merit to that statement. Maybe it's just that he chose not to hone the skill. We can't be sure, but it seems inconsistent with his character. \n\nNot that his character didn't change (i.e he's no longer about destruction but protection) but rather that he was investigating the otsosuki mystery even as early as \"the last.\" Were he wanting to protect, I think it would stand to reason that he'd master one of the most insane powers of all to protect the village he's trying to build.\n\nBut you also bring up the valid point that Sausage only has one rinnegan... which again doesn't really make sense. The idea that the chakra the sage gave him made one eye develop is bizarre and inconsistent. Madara is the only person to develop them naturally outside the original otsosuki, and they both appear at once because his network of chakra now produces the effects to make them. \n\nIf the sage gave him chakra that lasted, both eyes should have developed if not at first then eventually because his *network* of chakra would change his sharingan to a rinnegan (or at least allow him to do it at all like the mangekyo beacuse it's unclear if Madara could turn the rinnegan off like sharingan). If the sage did not give him chakra that lasted, the eye should have gone away like the sealing jutsu's power did because that was like Itachi's (shisui's) dojustsu he placed in Naruto.  \n\nReally the whole show was very backloaded and what ever is convenient at the time for kishi is how it works then, but not later, and it's always got to be bigger and better. I think this is a scope problem, so as to say that the original plot of the show was a short story that he wrote a long time ago with a different setting, and he really only envisioned things up until the chunin exams.\n\nAs much as a I LOVE shippuden and have many many statues of it. It was a continually a bad addition to the storyline each arc. Every arc made less and less sense in the scope of the story and I never felt like I understood more, only had more plot and more plot holes to play with.",

Scythes?). In fact, he knows all natures, give him Sarutobi\u2019s level of knowledge. There\u2019s no way the 2 greatest of all time fought like ants. Especially not the Hokage.",

You can argue that One Piece is older now or airing longer than Naruto but One Piece had great themes, fights, music and World building and what not compared to Naruto. Oda gives side characters we will never see again a nice background Story while we dont see shit in Naruto about the Ambitions of the Konoha 11. Also Power scaling wise Naruto is a clusterfuck of inconsistencies. One piece has its own issues and inconsistencies but Naruto has a lot of plot holes and issues. The biggest thing I dislike is the whole \"I cares for naruto\" stuff when the third Hokage didnt. In Classic Naruto he could use all 5 elements was called the God of Shinobi or something like that while Shippuden showed us that barely anyone has 5 elements. Most have 2 and some have 3 while some actual Geniuses (not prophecy children or Kakashi lol) can use 4 elements (Onoki and his Master dont know his Name rn). We also saw that the first, the second and the fourth Hokage were stronger than him. Also Kakashi being scared of Orochimaru in classic naruto while we saw that he hung out with Itachi in the anbu Corps. The Anbu were inconsistencies too and 99% of characters never got developed past their introduction. Kishimoto shot in his own leg again when he tried to justify naruto trying to save Sasukes emo bitch ass when Rock Lee, Shikamaru and Choji were actual friends and Shikamaru being like an actual brother to him. Also explaining everything that happened with \"actually danzo did it\" and \"hashirama cells lmao\". The whole Clan thing also was hot garbage. He basically fanboyed the Uchihas and their terroristic tendencies and shat on the Senjus whatever the fuck happened to them and basically said \"fuck the uzumakis too\". Naruto never used a single uzumaki technique.",

Early part 1 Naruto but with the characters swapped, b.) Powerscaling: The Series (Suggsverse Shippuden), or c.) Isshiki getting DPed by Naruto and Sasuke for 60 chapters straight while Boruto goes \"woah omg dad ur so cool and ninja I wanna be cool like you and not loser dum like ye OwO\"\n\nSorry if any vitriol leaks out. I'm sure you can understand the built-up frustration from people shitting on things you like every single day like it makes them cool. Personally, I just stick to things I like.

We can't be sure, but it seems inconsistent with his character. \n\nNot that his character didn't change (i.e he's no longer about destruction but protection) but rather that he was investigating the otsosuki mystery even as early as \"the last.\" Were he wanting to protect, I think it would stand to reason that he'd master one of the most insane powers of all to protect the village he's trying to build.\n\nBut you also bring up the valid point that Sausage only has one rinnegan... which again doesn't really make sense. The idea that the chakra the sage gave him made one eye develop is bizarre and inconsistent. Madara is the only person to develop them naturally outside the original otsosuki, and they both appear at once because his network of chakra now produces the effects to make them. \n\nIf the sage gave him chakra that lasted, both eyes should have developed if not at first then eventually because his *network* of chakra would change his sharingan to a rinnegan (or at least allow him to do it at all like the mangekyo beacuse it's unclear if Madara could turn the rinnegan off like sharingan). If the sage did not give him chakra that lasted, the eye should have gone away like the sealing jutsu's power did because that was like Itachi's (shisui's) dojustsu he placed in Naruto.  \n\nReally the whole show was very backloaded and what ever is convenient at the time for kishi is how it works then, but not later, and it's always got to be bigger and better. I think this is a scope problem, so as to say that the original plot of the show was a short story that he wrote a long time ago with a different setting, and he really only envisioned things up until the chunin exams.\n\nAs much as a I LOVE shippuden and have many many statues of it. It was a continually a bad addition to the storyline each arc. Every arc made less and less sense in the scope of the story and I never felt like I understood more, only had more plot and more plot holes to play with.",

While yes, Naruto and Sasuke have matured, they've also forgotten what's a shinobi is. They've gotten smarter but less alert on the field. Theyve been in peace too long. Atleast Naruto has. Sasuke has no excuse though since he's been fighting otsosuki and destroying the remains of kaguya for the last like 13 years. The fact that he wouldn't be paying attention is an even worse argument then him being out of Chakra. You would think with their Maturity they would grow as shinobi and realize when an opponent should be taken seriously, not half assed.",

You can argue that One Piece is older now or airing longer than Naruto but One Piece had great themes, fights, music and World building and what not compared to Naruto. Oda gives side characters we will never see again a nice background Story while we dont see shit in Naruto about the Ambitions of the Konoha 11. Also Power scaling wise Naruto is a clusterfuck of inconsistencies. One piece has its own issues and inconsistencies but Naruto has a lot of plot holes and issues. The biggest thing I dislike is the whole \"I cares for naruto\" stuff when the third Hokage didnt. In Classic Naruto he could use all 5 elements was called the God of Shinobi or something like that while Shippuden showed us that barely anyone has 5 elements. Most have 2 and some have 3 while some actual Geniuses (not prophecy children or Kakashi lol) can use 4 elements (Onoki and his Master dont know his Name rn). We also saw that the first, the second and the fourth Hokage were stronger than him. Also Kakashi being scared of Orochimaru in classic naruto while we saw that he hung out with Itachi in the anbu Corps. The Anbu were inconsistencies too and 99% of characters never got developed past their introduction. Kishimoto shot in his own leg again when he tried to justify naruto trying to save Sasukes emo bitch ass when Rock Lee, Shikamaru and Choji were actual friends and Shikamaru being like an actual brother to him. Also explaining everything that happened with \"actually danzo did it\" and \"hashirama cells lmao\". The whole Clan thing also was hot garbage. He basically fanboyed the Uchihas and their terroristic tendencies and shat on the Senjus whatever the fuck happened to them and basically said \"fuck the uzumakis too\". Naruto never used a single uzumaki technique.",

We can't be sure, but it seems inconsistent with his character. \n\nNot that his character didn't change (i.e he's no longer about destruction but protection) but rather that he was investigating the otsosuki mystery even as early as \"the last.\" Were he wanting to protect, I think it would stand to reason that he'd master one of the most insane powers of all to protect the village he's trying to build.\n\nBut you also bring up the valid point that Sausage only has one rinnegan... which again doesn't really make sense. The idea that the chakra the sage gave him made one eye develop is bizarre and inconsistent. Madara is the only person to develop them naturally outside the original otsosuki, and they both appear at once because his network of chakra now produces the effects to make them. \n\nIf the sage gave him chakra that lasted, both eyes should have developed if not at first then eventually because his *network* of chakra would change his sharingan to a rinnegan (or at least allow him to do it at all like the mangekyo beacuse it's unclear if Madara could turn the rinnegan off like sharingan). If the sage did not give him chakra that lasted, the eye should have gone away like the sealing jutsu's power did because that was like Itachi's (shisui's) dojustsu he placed in Naruto.  \n\nReally the whole show was very backloaded and what ever is convenient at the time for kishi is how it works then, but not later, and it's always got to be bigger and better. I think this is a scope problem, so as to say that the original plot of the show was a short story that he wrote a long time ago with a different setting, and he really only envisioned things up until the chunin exams.\n\nAs much as a I LOVE shippuden and have many many statues of it. It was a continually a bad addition to the storyline each arc. Every arc made less and less sense in the scope of the story and I never felt like I understood more, only had more plot and more plot holes to play with.",

And in the fight with jigen we see that his renigan was still charged so he still had Chakra to use it. Its an honest shame how nerfed Sasuke got",

Sasuke has no excuse though since he's been fighting otsosuki and destroying the remains of kaguya for the last like 13 years.

You can argue that One Piece is older now or airing longer than Naruto but One Piece had great themes, fights, music and World building and what not compared to Naruto. Oda gives side characters we will never see again a nice background Story while we dont see shit in Naruto about the Ambitions of the Konoha 11. Also Power scaling wise Naruto is a clusterfuck of inconsistencies. One piece has its own issues and inconsistencies but Naruto has a lot of plot holes and issues. The biggest thing I dislike is the whole \"I cares for naruto\" stuff when the third Hokage didnt. In Classic Naruto he could use all 5 elements was called the God of Shinobi or something like that while Shippuden showed us that barely anyone has 5 elements. Most have 2 and some have 3 while some actual Geniuses (not prophecy children or Kakashi lol) can use 4 elements (Onoki and his Master dont know his Name rn). We also saw that the first, the second and the fourth Hokage were stronger than him. Also Kakashi being scared of Orochimaru in classic naruto while we saw that he hung out with Itachi in the anbu Corps. The Anbu were inconsistencies too and 99% of characters never got developed past their introduction. Kishimoto shot in his own leg again when he tried to justify naruto trying to save Sasukes emo bitch ass when Rock Lee, Shikamaru and Choji were actual friends and Shikamaru being like an actual brother to him. Also explaining everything that happened with \"actually danzo did it\" and \"hashirama cells lmao\". The whole Clan thing also was hot garbage. He basically fanboyed the Uchihas and their terroristic tendencies and shat on the Senjus whatever the fuck happened to them and basically said \"fuck the uzumakis too\". Naruto never used a single uzumaki technique.",

So Nagato used the weakest form of rinnegan. \n\nSasuke\u2019s rinnegan is supposed to be more powerful than Nagato/Madara because he actually inherited it through the SoSP while Madara forcefully awakened his by implanting Hashirama\u2019s cells in his body. Then in order to not let the eyes die along with his body, he implanted them in Nagato until he was revived.",

Again, in his words, he was out of Chakra. That's the whole reason he was running away from deidera if im correct. Can't use his renigan twice? Didn't he use it multiple times in the fight with momoshikki and was completely fine? He also used susano. And in the fight with jigen we see that his renigan was still charged so he still had Chakra to use it. Its an honest shame how nerfed Sasuke got",

For some fans it pisses them off. For others it\u2019s all about maturity. Remember Hiruzen? He has sooo many abilities and we barely saw his capabilities due to his own student trying to kill him. \n\nIdk, something about it makes sense to me maybe I\u2019m biased but I see it both ways for sure.",

They've gotten smarter but less alert on the field. Theyve been in peace too long. Atleast Naruto has. Sasuke has no excuse though since he's been fighting otsosuki and destroying the remains of kaguya for the last like 13 years. The fact that he wouldn't be paying attention is an even worse argument then him being out of Chakra. You would think with their Maturity they would grow as shinobi and realize when an opponent should be taken seriously, not half assed.",

Sasuke has no excuse though since he's been fighting otsosuki and destroying the remains of kaguya for the last like 13 years. The fact that he wouldn't be paying attention is an even worse argument then him being out of Chakra. You would think with their Maturity they would grow as shinobi and realize when an opponent should be taken seriously, not half assed.",
