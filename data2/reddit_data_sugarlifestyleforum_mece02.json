    "body": "Got a boyfriend now after 3 years of sugaring, it\u2019s a brand new chapter in my life.\n\nWe had our first sexy-time today and I kept giggling coz it was strange seeing someone my age in bed \ud83d\ude06\n\nBreaking up w my SDs was easier than I imagined. They were understanding and gave us their blessings. A bit sad I can\u2019t see them anymore because I did enjoy their company.\n\nSugarlifestyleforum really helped me out and I\u2019m really glad we have a community here, so thanks everyone for advice and good banter.\n\nStill gonna lurk around here but now I gotta wrap my head around vanilla dating. I\u2019ve only dated SDs!!!!!!!\n\nThanks for reading, just wanted to share.\nWould love to read your thoughts or stories on this sort of transition too \u263a\ufe0f",

As long as you\u2019re happy and thanks for sharing. Reminded me of one of the Professors I had gotten close to when I was in College. He used to take a jar (that\u2019s our life), fill it with different sized balls/colors (people, events of significance, knowledge) and then pour beer (have fun) to fill the rest! \n\nHave fun!",

I lost the great love of my life over 30 years ago. Been looking, unsuccessfully,  for another ever since. \nI raised four children who are each successful adults. Of that I am proud. I helped any number of young women, in any number of ways, when they needed  help, guidance and a reliable, loving friend. Of that I am equally proud.",
