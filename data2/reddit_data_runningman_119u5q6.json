I dunno, a lot has changed too. My friend feels the same and 2020 to 2023 is indeed a long time. We tried refunding it but got no luck in our attempts since there was a time SM Tickets was really hard to deal with.\n\nSince we are both not on the same hype anymore as before, we'd rather give up the tickets and sell them to more willing fans who deserve this spot.\n\nI still love them a lot, just not as much as before.  \n:)",
