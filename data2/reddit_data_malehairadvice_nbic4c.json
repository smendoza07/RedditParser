After a while I realized that everybody thought it looks great and it just took me a while to get used to it and feel comfortable. That being said, this look suits you well and I'd like to encourage you to just go with it. Every now and then you might wanna thin out the lower hair in the back while you don\\`t cut the hair on top and on the sides. But yeah, looking good there!",

My personal favorite way to wear mine is half up and half down like yours is in the pic. Instead of a back ponytail, I\u2019ll wrap mine in a bun like a samurai lol. I think yours looks good, but at that length, i think it would look best when you pull all of it up. \nWhen I first grew mine out, I was extremely self conscious about having my hair pulled up in any way. You\u2019re probably experiencing the same thing. I bet it\u2019s because we\u2019re not used to seeing ourselves like that, bc it\u2019s different than the norm. Wear it out a few times and you\u2019ll get more used to seeing yourself in the mirror and you\u2019ll begin to get more confident about it.

If most of them are put up over your head it\u2019ll wobble and feel weighted too. Your hair type will also have a lot to do with it, I have really curly 4c hair so it\u2019s not as heavy but I wouldn\u2019t doubt a straighter type of hair would feel heavier.",
