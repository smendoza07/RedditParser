    "body": "It\u2019s absurd that SDs ask if you\u2019re on birth control and once you say yes, they assume unprotected sex is on the table. So you care more about having a baby then an incurable STD? \n\nThen they respond with a, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m clean.\u201d as if that random sentence from a complete stranger on the interweb, is supposed to quell my fears. \n\nIt really is disgusting that they care so little about it. Why is unknown, raw vagina so thrilling to them?!\n\nEDIT: \ud83d\ude02 of course I know men love raw sex, I like it too after vetting and testing. The keyword in that sentence is UNKNOWN aka risky. Yes, we as a society do it all the time in vanilla dating but isn\u2019t sugaring a form of sex work? And if so, shouldn\u2019t we be a little more apprehensive? Some of you in these comments haven\u2019t been tested in over a decade and it shows.",

So, it's not exactly accurate to say they should be weighed as equal risks: it doesn't necessarily follow that \"if it matters for anal, it matters for oral.\" \n\nIf someone is uncomfortable with taking on any level of risk and insists on condom use for all sex acts, I won't begrudge them that viewpoint at all. But the risk levels are not equal in allowing a new SD to slip PiV bareback vs giving them an uncovered BJ. Statistically, the former is far more reckless than the latter. Again, if it's still out of range of someone's risk tolerance, then certainly don't do either.",

The baseline (people outside of sugar dating) are likely to be of the more monogamous types, and less likely to be the type that sleep around a lot recklessly.\n\nBut if you're looking for an article...

Same with covid, the more they tested the more positive cases were found and the more the panic ensued. Therefore, sugar dating is actually lower or at least on par with the rates of casual dating, and people are actually more concerned about testing and ensuring safety.",

So, it's not exactly accurate to say they should be weighed as equal risks: it doesn't necessarily follow that \"if it matters for anal, it matters for oral.\" \n\nIf someone is uncomfortable with taking on any level of risk and insists on condom use for all sex acts, I won't begrudge them that viewpoint at all. But the risk levels are not equal in allowing a new SD to slip PiV bareback vs giving them an uncovered BJ. Statistically, the former is far more reckless than the latter. Again, if it's still out of range of someone's risk tolerance, then certainly don't do either.",

I always tell partners/sugars beforehand because everyone deserves autonomy in their sexual health. I literally keep it in my profile that I have hsv2. That being said, there are MANY people who are willing to take that risk and not used condoms. It kind of baffles me, but at the same time I don\u2019t hate it because well, I\u2019m still getting laid and all the other fun sugar stuff. Everyone who requires testing and condoms is absolutely right.",

So, it's not exactly accurate to say they should be weighed as equal risks: it doesn't necessarily follow that \"if it matters for anal, it matters for oral.\" \n\nIf someone is uncomfortable with taking on any level of risk and insists on condom use for all sex acts, I won't begrudge them that viewpoint at all. But the risk levels are not equal in allowing a new SD to slip PiV bareback vs giving them an uncovered BJ. Statistically, the former is far more reckless than the latter. Again, if it's still out of range of someone's risk tolerance, then certainly don't do either.",

So, it's not exactly accurate to say they should be weighed as equal risks: it doesn't necessarily follow that \"if it matters for anal, it matters for oral.\" \n\nIf someone is uncomfortable with taking on any level of risk and insists on condom use for all sex acts, I won't begrudge them that viewpoint at all. But the risk levels are not equal in allowing a new SD to slip PiV bareback vs giving them an uncovered BJ. Statistically, the former is far more reckless than the latter. Again, if it's still out of range of someone's risk tolerance, then certainly don't do either.",

So, it's not exactly accurate to say they should be weighed as equal risks: it doesn't necessarily follow that \"if it matters for anal, it matters for oral.\" \n\nIf someone is uncomfortable with taking on any level of risk and insists on condom use for all sex acts, I won't begrudge them that viewpoint at all. But the risk levels are not equal in allowing a new SD to slip PiV bareback vs giving them an uncovered BJ. Statistically, the former is far more reckless than the latter. Again, if it's still out of range of someone's risk tolerance, then certainly don't do either.",
