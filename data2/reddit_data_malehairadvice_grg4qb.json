If your hair is this short on the sides probably don't worry about too much product there, but you can do a little if you want to match the texture",

What about the top?\n\nI usually ask for a #1.5 and low taper on the sides, high taper on back and finger length scissor cut up top with a bit longer in the middle to wear messy. Would this be similar, but with longer and equal length up top?",
