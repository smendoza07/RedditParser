    "body": "I hate this. It's so annoying.\n\nNot always but for these reasons:\n\n1) you can ask, not demand\n\n2) you can say \"please\"\n\n3) WE HAVENT EVEN HAD A M&G YET\n\n4) I'm not a performing monkey\n\nI'm just trying to make plans and run errands at the same time. I would never ask him to pay for a photo, but it feels dehumanizing due to the fact that he thinks I would just drop whatever I'm doing just to please him.\n\nYou're not my boyfriend. You're not my dom. Check yourself.\n\n Why do you deserve it? Why should I take time out of my day? I have private photos on my profile for a reason.\n\nAm I in the wrong?",

I\u2019m not comfortable sending one before then and even then would prefer to do it on my own terms instead of by request.\u201d\n\nMaybe that\u2019s harsh but I\u2019m annoyed by this sort of thing too.

Emended you\u2019re creating an alias a bad bitch persona that a man should list into. \n\nI\u2019ll keep this short. Anything you get in life with out work, you don\u2019t appreciate. And you know who is at the end of every FUCKING aisle in Costco getting free samples? Men. SB/SD need boundaries in a classic way. You don\u2019t have to ask him to Zelle your ass. You need to ask him how important those pictures are to him - what he\u2019s going to do with them, and if it\u2019s something for his own personal benefit ... play into that shit. Don\u2019t drop his ass a shared iCloud folder. Send in tasteful strip photos over time - ask him how much he likes them... how much does he want more... this is exactly how porn sites make money and OF. IF YOU SELL THE FAEM BECAUSE HE ASKS ... he is going to go right over to aisle 8 to try some other BS free sample because he got his. The beauty of this game is that they need to work for it. It feels better when you work for it. It\u2019s always your choice boo. TIFFANY\u2019S DOESNT CHANGE THEIR MARKETING BECAUSE A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WINDOW SHOO AND LEAVE. Quality. Always.

Like they are making this request to....a woman who doesn't know him, hasn't met him, and he's just a stranger on the internet...but somehow her sending another pic is going to somehow magically change or improve things?? Why would she want to even do that for a random dude??  just don't get the point \ud83d\ude44.\n\nLike....if I was a scammer I'd just send another pic from the same person I stole pics from before \ud83d\ude44\n\nAnd woah is the woman who puts up a resistance and either doesn't respond back w one OR balks and says something telling him why she isn't down w that. Now she's seen as bitchy, jaded, or difficult. No dude....she's just smart and doesn't feel like putting her image out there for some dude that has literally done nothing for her and is likely just a pic collector at that point \ud83d\ude44\n\nIts just so rude when they make this request and such a turnoff.",
