I stopped at 150 (only had 150 episodes) and refused to watch anymore because it was bad. \n\nGaara as a character is still great. His hair though.  .  .\n\nNerfing Naruto makes sense for the story since boruto is supposed to be the hero (even if he has no hope of actually beating ishikki since Naruto at half strength was stronger then his main power so at full strength hes like double boruto at full power) but nerfing him from the start of the series with no explanation on how he got so weak or why he did (its worse in the anime) then the way he canonically gets nerfed with the lose of kurama is just bullshit. How the hell did he learn nuclear fusion?  Has it even been invented yet in Narutos time? If so, how the hell does kurama know it? He's been presumably sleeping for like 1k years and waking up every once inawhile when he's disturbed. \n\nI liked the 9 tails Chakra cloak because it looked cool. Especially 6path sage mode Chakra cloak. \n\nThe red Chakra cloak with just pure 9 tails Chakra is the exact same as 2 tails and up. Shukaku transformations are different since he only has 1 tail.",

It\u2019s only the fact that their premise is wrong.  \n\nYou then stated that altering destiny arrives at a contradiction, which you haven\u2019t substantiated at all on why that\u2019s the case.  You also said \u201cit\u2019s just logic,\u201d so now it\u2019s your burden to fulfill which type of logic system this is referring to.  You also need to prove OP is consistent in their reasoning (they\u2019re only consistent in making self-defeaters, not sound arguments, lol). \n\nIn short, OP self-conceded and you haven\u2019t made any type of counter arguments besides repetitive claims that have been negated by the false premise of destiny being unchangeable, thus changing it creates a contradiction.\n\nAnd imagine downvoting because you\u2019re bad at reasoning.",

Claiming it\u2019s a proof by contradiction without actually justifying why it is doesn\u2019t make it a proof by contradiction, plus it doesn\u2019t fit within the context of what was originally said. \n\n\u201cIn logic and mathematics, proof by contradiction is a form of proof that establishes the truth or the validity of a proposition, by showing that assuming the proposition to be false leads to a contradiction.\u201d\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction\n\nThis presupposes that the validity of a statement leads to a contradiction, but there is no contradiction in a work of fiction demonstrating that destiny can be altered, that would simply just mean that\u2019s how the cosmology operates, plus you would have to give a reason for why your definition of destiny is true by virtue of applying the law of identity to verify that it is identical to itself and has no external interference.\n\n\u201cThe premise isn\u2019t wrong\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s asserted without evidence gets dismissed without evidence.  I\u2019ve already told you why it\u2019s wrong.   Claiming that if destiny is altered, therefore it never existed to begin with is a massively incorrect premise to start with, because it presupposes that their definition of \u201cdestiny\u201d is the most valued definition tautologically, and that destiny operates the same across every fictional verse, which is their burden to prove.  The fact that you already agreed that some verses utilize destiny by virtue of altering it makes their argument and your argument a self-defeater, because you just conceded that destiny isn\u2019t an absolute term that has one singular interpretation, plus there\u2019s the fact that if you are inherently manipulating destiny, destiny had to be present for said manipulation, unless you want to argue they are manipulating nothing at all, lol.\n\n\u201cDefinitions don\u2019t need to be demonstrated\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s asserted without evidence gets dismissed without evidence.  You need to justify this claim.  And yes, you do need to in a setting where dialect is taking place, because not every mind is contingent upon a singularity, so you\u2019d have to prove there is some sort of absolute meaning and interpretation for Destiny in order for me to acknowledge that definitions don\u2019t need to be demonstrated. \n\n\u201cIs valid and a logical consequence\u201d\n\nSure, that could apply to a cosmology if that\u2019s how they use destiny/fate.  That\u2019s not an absolute definition though, and my definition of destiny within a work of fiction is essentially someone capable of operating under the sequence of events that controls their actions, or someone capable of altering events and/or sequences.  These are both true statements via the law of identity (eg. \u201cIt is snowing\u201d <<< this is a true statement if it is actually snowing, hence \u2018X is X\u2019, so my definition and your definition have no inconsistencies or faulty reasoning, so they can both be applied). \n\n\u201cPeople can\u2019t change it!\u201d\n\nAnd I\u2019m saying their definition is presupposing that it\u2019s absolute and applies to every cosmology, which it doesn\u2019t! Their definition is only right when a verse utilizes that type of destiny, and again, I never disagreed with that definition, I\u2019m just saying they used that definition under a false premise because they\u2019re assuming that their definition of destiny should apply in a singularity, which it doesn\u2019t because like I said, not every verse uses this definition of destiny.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s a contradiction\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s circular reasoning. I\u2019ve already presented to you why it wouldn\u2019t be a contradiction, it would simply just be a tautological thing that exists fundamentally the same amongst other interpretations. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fate in the first place\u201d\n\n- You\u2019re presupposing that your definition of fate is absolute and should apply as a tautologically objective thing amongst every possible world that holds zero inconsistencies (the fact that not every verse uses your definition negates this premise)\n\n- You\u2019re assuming that there is one interpretation of fate that should be held to a higher regard \n\n- You\u2019re also assuming that it can\u2019t be be fate by virtue of your definition, so how would you justify this?\n\nAgain, I\u2019d just argue that not every verse uses this interpretation, thus your argument is negated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m downvoting\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s already an L for you and shows me that you\u2019re insecure about yourself as well as your reasoning. \n\n\u201cYou talk like you\u2019re right\u201d\n\n- You\u2019re presupposing that I talk like I\u2019m right (I don\u2019t, I\u2019m just taking down your argument because it is inherently wrong, LMFAO)\n\n- You\u2019re assuming that me teaching people about why they\u2019re wrong means I think I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s right (I don\u2019t btw, you\u2019re just weird)\n\n\u201cAnd you can\u2019t even understand their definition\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve already established that I accept their definition, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s built on a false premise by virtue of it not being applicable on every foundation of knowledge. \n\nAnd no, that\u2019s not even a proof by contradiction, I established that earlier.  You\u2019re actually misinterpreting my argument and repeating the same stuff you said earlier, so I\u2019ll take this as a burden of rejoinder on your end via running away from standard dialect and not being able to justify a position (Hitchen\u2019s razor negates practically every assertion you\u2019ve made thus far, lol).",

Kaguya, for instance, is likely inspired by *The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter* in which a moon princess by the same name is discovered inside a bamboo chute as a baby. Her origins as a moon princess are only known to the reader, and only revealed to the rest of the characters in the tale at the very end when she returns to the moon. Anything regarding her background, how she wound up on earth, or why she wound up on earth aren't mentioned in most versions of the story.\n\nI guess I'm just trying to point out that a moon princess isn't any more special than a nine-tailed demon fox when it comes to Japanese mythology.",

It completely negates the power system of the show and limits every charecter except the villians to taijutsu. Which I will not complain about Taijutsu fights are great, but it sure as hell is not the same.",

He\u2019s become a splendid Shinobi even with his handicaps. \n\nLee gave Gaara a a great fight, as did Guy give Madara a great fight. \n\nWith your Kakashi vs Guy point, there\u2019s always the dual MS perfect Susanoo version of Kakashi lol. \n\n\nHere\u2019s what Kishi himself says about the [theme](https://ibb.co/546mxd5). He was never pushing the theme that hard work > talent/gifts (nor would it make sense to, given his main character has a giant demon inside him, was stated to have potential to be better than all Hokage in chapter 1), but rather, that hard work pays off",

How the hell did he learn nuclear fusion?  Has it even been invented yet in Narutos time? If so, how the hell does kurama know it? He's been presumably sleeping for like 1k years and waking up every once inawhile when he's disturbed. \n\nI liked the 9 tails Chakra cloak because it looked cool. Especially 6path sage mode Chakra cloak. \n\nThe red Chakra cloak with just pure 9 tails Chakra is the exact same as 2 tails and up. Shukaku transformations are different since he only has 1 tail.",

It\u2019s only the fact that their premise is wrong.  \n\nYou then stated that altering destiny arrives at a contradiction, which you haven\u2019t substantiated at all on why that\u2019s the case.  You also said \u201cit\u2019s just logic,\u201d so now it\u2019s your burden to fulfill which type of logic system this is referring to.  You also need to prove OP is consistent in their reasoning (they\u2019re only consistent in making self-defeaters, not sound arguments, lol). \n\nIn short, OP self-conceded and you haven\u2019t made any type of counter arguments besides repetitive claims that have been negated by the false premise of destiny being unchangeable, thus changing it creates a contradiction.\n\nAnd imagine downvoting because you\u2019re bad at reasoning.",

Claiming it\u2019s a proof by contradiction without actually justifying why it is doesn\u2019t make it a proof by contradiction, plus it doesn\u2019t fit within the context of what was originally said. \n\n\u201cIn logic and mathematics, proof by contradiction is a form of proof that establishes the truth or the validity of a proposition, by showing that assuming the proposition to be false leads to a contradiction.\u201d\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction\n\nThis presupposes that the validity of a statement leads to a contradiction, but there is no contradiction in a work of fiction demonstrating that destiny can be altered, that would simply just mean that\u2019s how the cosmology operates, plus you would have to give a reason for why your definition of destiny is true by virtue of applying the law of identity to verify that it is identical to itself and has no external interference.\n\n\u201cThe premise isn\u2019t wrong\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s asserted without evidence gets dismissed without evidence.  I\u2019ve already told you why it\u2019s wrong.   Claiming that if destiny is altered, therefore it never existed to begin with is a massively incorrect premise to start with, because it presupposes that their definition of \u201cdestiny\u201d is the most valued definition tautologically, and that destiny operates the same across every fictional verse, which is their burden to prove.  The fact that you already agreed that some verses utilize destiny by virtue of altering it makes their argument and your argument a self-defeater, because you just conceded that destiny isn\u2019t an absolute term that has one singular interpretation, plus there\u2019s the fact that if you are inherently manipulating destiny, destiny had to be present for said manipulation, unless you want to argue they are manipulating nothing at all, lol.\n\n\u201cDefinitions don\u2019t need to be demonstrated\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s asserted without evidence gets dismissed without evidence.  You need to justify this claim.  And yes, you do need to in a setting where dialect is taking place, because not every mind is contingent upon a singularity, so you\u2019d have to prove there is some sort of absolute meaning and interpretation for Destiny in order for me to acknowledge that definitions don\u2019t need to be demonstrated. \n\n\u201cIs valid and a logical consequence\u201d\n\nSure, that could apply to a cosmology if that\u2019s how they use destiny/fate.  That\u2019s not an absolute definition though, and my definition of destiny within a work of fiction is essentially someone capable of operating under the sequence of events that controls their actions, or someone capable of altering events and/or sequences.  These are both true statements via the law of identity (eg. \u201cIt is snowing\u201d <<< this is a true statement if it is actually snowing, hence \u2018X is X\u2019, so my definition and your definition have no inconsistencies or faulty reasoning, so they can both be applied). \n\n\u201cPeople can\u2019t change it!\u201d\n\nAnd I\u2019m saying their definition is presupposing that it\u2019s absolute and applies to every cosmology, which it doesn\u2019t! Their definition is only right when a verse utilizes that type of destiny, and again, I never disagreed with that definition, I\u2019m just saying they used that definition under a false premise because they\u2019re assuming that their definition of destiny should apply in a singularity, which it doesn\u2019t because like I said, not every verse uses this definition of destiny.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s a contradiction\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s circular reasoning. I\u2019ve already presented to you why it wouldn\u2019t be a contradiction, it would simply just be a tautological thing that exists fundamentally the same amongst other interpretations. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fate in the first place\u201d\n\n- You\u2019re presupposing that your definition of fate is absolute and should apply as a tautologically objective thing amongst every possible world that holds zero inconsistencies (the fact that not every verse uses your definition negates this premise)\n\n- You\u2019re assuming that there is one interpretation of fate that should be held to a higher regard \n\n- You\u2019re also assuming that it can\u2019t be be fate by virtue of your definition, so how would you justify this?\n\nAgain, I\u2019d just argue that not every verse uses this interpretation, thus your argument is negated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m downvoting\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s already an L for you and shows me that you\u2019re insecure about yourself as well as your reasoning. \n\n\u201cYou talk like you\u2019re right\u201d\n\n- You\u2019re presupposing that I talk like I\u2019m right (I don\u2019t, I\u2019m just taking down your argument because it is inherently wrong, LMFAO)\n\n- You\u2019re assuming that me teaching people about why they\u2019re wrong means I think I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s right (I don\u2019t btw, you\u2019re just weird)\n\n\u201cAnd you can\u2019t even understand their definition\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve already established that I accept their definition, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s built on a false premise by virtue of it not being applicable on every foundation of knowledge. \n\nAnd no, that\u2019s not even a proof by contradiction, I established that earlier.  You\u2019re actually misinterpreting my argument and repeating the same stuff you said earlier, so I\u2019ll take this as a burden of rejoinder on your end via running away from standard dialect and not being able to justify a position (Hitchen\u2019s razor negates practically every assertion you\u2019ve made thus far, lol).",

Kaguya, for instance, is likely inspired by *The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter* in which a moon princess by the same name is discovered inside a bamboo chute as a baby. Her origins as a moon princess are only known to the reader, and only revealed to the rest of the characters in the tale at the very end when she returns to the moon. Anything regarding her background, how she wound up on earth, or why she wound up on earth aren't mentioned in most versions of the story.\n\nI guess I'm just trying to point out that a moon princess isn't any more special than a nine-tailed demon fox when it comes to Japanese mythology.",

I stopped at 150 (only had 150 episodes) and refused to watch anymore because it was bad. \n\nGaara as a character is still great. His hair though.  .  .\n\nNerfing Naruto makes sense for the story since boruto is supposed to be the hero (even if he has no hope of actually beating ishikki since Naruto at half strength was stronger then his main power so at full strength hes like double boruto at full power) but nerfing him from the start of the series with no explanation on how he got so weak or why he did (its worse in the anime) then the way he canonically gets nerfed with the lose of kurama is just bullshit. How the hell did he learn nuclear fusion?  Has it even been invented yet in Narutos time? If so, how the hell does kurama know it? He's been presumably sleeping for like 1k years and waking up every once inawhile when he's disturbed. \n\nI liked the 9 tails Chakra cloak because it looked cool. Especially 6path sage mode Chakra cloak. \n\nThe red Chakra cloak with just pure 9 tails Chakra is the exact same as 2 tails and up. Shukaku transformations are different since he only has 1 tail.",

That would need to be demonstrated throughout every work of fiction tautologically.  Destiny according to multiple sources inherently refers to events that will occur in the future which are usually identified to be unchangeable.  This doesn\u2019t always apply in fiction.  It\u2019s only the fact that their premise is wrong.  \n\nYou then stated that altering destiny arrives at a contradiction, which you haven\u2019t substantiated at all on why that\u2019s the case.  You also said \u201cit\u2019s just logic,\u201d so now it\u2019s your burden to fulfill which type of logic system this is referring to.  You also need to prove OP is consistent in their reasoning (they\u2019re only consistent in making self-defeaters, not sound arguments, lol). \n\nIn short, OP self-conceded and you haven\u2019t made any type of counter arguments besides repetitive claims that have been negated by the false premise of destiny being unchangeable, thus changing it creates a contradiction.\n\nAnd imagine downvoting because you\u2019re bad at reasoning.",

Claiming it\u2019s a proof by contradiction without actually justifying why it is doesn\u2019t make it a proof by contradiction, plus it doesn\u2019t fit within the context of what was originally said. \n\n\u201cIn logic and mathematics, proof by contradiction is a form of proof that establishes the truth or the validity of a proposition, by showing that assuming the proposition to be false leads to a contradiction.\u201d\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction\n\nThis presupposes that the validity of a statement leads to a contradiction, but there is no contradiction in a work of fiction demonstrating that destiny can be altered, that would simply just mean that\u2019s how the cosmology operates, plus you would have to give a reason for why your definition of destiny is true by virtue of applying the law of identity to verify that it is identical to itself and has no external interference.\n\n\u201cThe premise isn\u2019t wrong\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s asserted without evidence gets dismissed without evidence.  I\u2019ve already told you why it\u2019s wrong.   Claiming that if destiny is altered, therefore it never existed to begin with is a massively incorrect premise to start with, because it presupposes that their definition of \u201cdestiny\u201d is the most valued definition tautologically, and that destiny operates the same across every fictional verse, which is their burden to prove.  The fact that you already agreed that some verses utilize destiny by virtue of altering it makes their argument and your argument a self-defeater, because you just conceded that destiny isn\u2019t an absolute term that has one singular interpretation, plus there\u2019s the fact that if you are inherently manipulating destiny, destiny had to be present for said manipulation, unless you want to argue they are manipulating nothing at all, lol.\n\n\u201cDefinitions don\u2019t need to be demonstrated\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s asserted without evidence gets dismissed without evidence.  You need to justify this claim.  And yes, you do need to in a setting where dialect is taking place, because not every mind is contingent upon a singularity, so you\u2019d have to prove there is some sort of absolute meaning and interpretation for Destiny in order for me to acknowledge that definitions don\u2019t need to be demonstrated. \n\n\u201cIs valid and a logical consequence\u201d\n\nSure, that could apply to a cosmology if that\u2019s how they use destiny/fate.  That\u2019s not an absolute definition though, and my definition of destiny within a work of fiction is essentially someone capable of operating under the sequence of events that controls their actions, or someone capable of altering events and/or sequences.  These are both true statements via the law of identity (eg. \u201cIt is snowing\u201d <<< this is a true statement if it is actually snowing, hence \u2018X is X\u2019, so my definition and your definition have no inconsistencies or faulty reasoning, so they can both be applied). \n\n\u201cPeople can\u2019t change it!\u201d\n\nAnd I\u2019m saying their definition is presupposing that it\u2019s absolute and applies to every cosmology, which it doesn\u2019t! Their definition is only right when a verse utilizes that type of destiny, and again, I never disagreed with that definition, I\u2019m just saying they used that definition under a false premise because they\u2019re assuming that their definition of destiny should apply in a singularity, which it doesn\u2019t because like I said, not every verse uses this definition of destiny.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s a contradiction\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s circular reasoning. I\u2019ve already presented to you why it wouldn\u2019t be a contradiction, it would simply just be a tautological thing that exists fundamentally the same amongst other interpretations. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fate in the first place\u201d\n\n- You\u2019re presupposing that your definition of fate is absolute and should apply as a tautologically objective thing amongst every possible world that holds zero inconsistencies (the fact that not every verse uses your definition negates this premise)\n\n- You\u2019re assuming that there is one interpretation of fate that should be held to a higher regard \n\n- You\u2019re also assuming that it can\u2019t be be fate by virtue of your definition, so how would you justify this?\n\nAgain, I\u2019d just argue that not every verse uses this interpretation, thus your argument is negated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m downvoting\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s already an L for you and shows me that you\u2019re insecure about yourself as well as your reasoning. \n\n\u201cYou talk like you\u2019re right\u201d\n\n- You\u2019re presupposing that I talk like I\u2019m right (I don\u2019t, I\u2019m just taking down your argument because it is inherently wrong, LMFAO)\n\n- You\u2019re assuming that me teaching people about why they\u2019re wrong means I think I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s right (I don\u2019t btw, you\u2019re just weird)\n\n\u201cAnd you can\u2019t even understand their definition\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve already established that I accept their definition, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s built on a false premise by virtue of it not being applicable on every foundation of knowledge. \n\nAnd no, that\u2019s not even a proof by contradiction, I established that earlier.  You\u2019re actually misinterpreting my argument and repeating the same stuff you said earlier, so I\u2019ll take this as a burden of rejoinder on your end via running away from standard dialect and not being able to justify a position (Hitchen\u2019s razor negates practically every assertion you\u2019ve made thus far, lol).",

Which is why Guy said to Lee, even after losing to Gaara, that he\u2019s already proven his ninja way. He\u2019s become a splendid Shinobi even with his handicaps. \n\nLee gave Gaara a a great fight, as did Guy give Madara a great fight. \n\nWith your Kakashi vs Guy point, there\u2019s always the dual MS perfect Susanoo version of Kakashi lol. \n\n\nHere\u2019s what Kishi himself says about the [theme](https://ibb.co/546mxd5). He was never pushing the theme that hard work > talent/gifts (nor would it make sense to, given his main character has a giant demon inside him, was stated to have potential to be better than all Hokage in chapter 1), but rather, that hard work pays off",

How the hell did he learn nuclear fusion?  Has it even been invented yet in Narutos time? If so, how the hell does kurama know it? He's been presumably sleeping for like 1k years and waking up every once inawhile when he's disturbed. \n\nI liked the 9 tails Chakra cloak because it looked cool. Especially 6path sage mode Chakra cloak. \n\nThe red Chakra cloak with just pure 9 tails Chakra is the exact same as 2 tails and up. Shukaku transformations are different since he only has 1 tail.",

They are essentially saying that changing your destiny entails that destiny doesn\u2019t exist, but in order to change destiny, it must be prevalent in existence in order for it to be altered, which already negates everything you\u2019ve been saying so far, lmfaoooo.\n\n\u201cWith others this can\u2019t happen\u201d\n\nAgain, I\u2019ve never once disagreed with that, I\u2019m just countering the OP\u2019s claim that altering destiny entails that it doesn\u2019t exist.  That would need to be demonstrated throughout every work of fiction tautologically.  Destiny according to multiple sources inherently refers to events that will occur in the future which are usually identified to be unchangeable.  This doesn\u2019t always apply in fiction.  It\u2019s only the fact that their premise is wrong.  \n\nYou then stated that altering destiny arrives at a contradiction, which you haven\u2019t substantiated at all on why that\u2019s the case.  You also said \u201cit\u2019s just logic,\u201d so now it\u2019s your burden to fulfill which type of logic system this is referring to.  You also need to prove OP is consistent in their reasoning (they\u2019re only consistent in making self-defeaters, not sound arguments, lol). \n\nIn short, OP self-conceded and you haven\u2019t made any type of counter arguments besides repetitive claims that have been negated by the false premise of destiny being unchangeable, thus changing it creates a contradiction.\n\nAnd imagine downvoting because you\u2019re bad at reasoning.",

Claiming it\u2019s a proof by contradiction without actually justifying why it is doesn\u2019t make it a proof by contradiction, plus it doesn\u2019t fit within the context of what was originally said. \n\n\u201cIn logic and mathematics, proof by contradiction is a form of proof that establishes the truth or the validity of a proposition, by showing that assuming the proposition to be false leads to a contradiction.\u201d\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction\n\nThis presupposes that the validity of a statement leads to a contradiction, but there is no contradiction in a work of fiction demonstrating that destiny can be altered, that would simply just mean that\u2019s how the cosmology operates, plus you would have to give a reason for why your definition of destiny is true by virtue of applying the law of identity to verify that it is identical to itself and has no external interference.\n\n\u201cThe premise isn\u2019t wrong\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s asserted without evidence gets dismissed without evidence.  I\u2019ve already told you why it\u2019s wrong.   Claiming that if destiny is altered, therefore it never existed to begin with is a massively incorrect premise to start with, because it presupposes that their definition of \u201cdestiny\u201d is the most valued definition tautologically, and that destiny operates the same across every fictional verse, which is their burden to prove.  The fact that you already agreed that some verses utilize destiny by virtue of altering it makes their argument and your argument a self-defeater, because you just conceded that destiny isn\u2019t an absolute term that has one singular interpretation, plus there\u2019s the fact that if you are inherently manipulating destiny, destiny had to be present for said manipulation, unless you want to argue they are manipulating nothing at all, lol.\n\n\u201cDefinitions don\u2019t need to be demonstrated\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s asserted without evidence gets dismissed without evidence.  You need to justify this claim.  And yes, you do need to in a setting where dialect is taking place, because not every mind is contingent upon a singularity, so you\u2019d have to prove there is some sort of absolute meaning and interpretation for Destiny in order for me to acknowledge that definitions don\u2019t need to be demonstrated. \n\n\u201cIs valid and a logical consequence\u201d\n\nSure, that could apply to a cosmology if that\u2019s how they use destiny/fate.  That\u2019s not an absolute definition though, and my definition of destiny within a work of fiction is essentially someone capable of operating under the sequence of events that controls their actions, or someone capable of altering events and/or sequences.  These are both true statements via the law of identity (eg. \u201cIt is snowing\u201d <<< this is a true statement if it is actually snowing, hence \u2018X is X\u2019, so my definition and your definition have no inconsistencies or faulty reasoning, so they can both be applied). \n\n\u201cPeople can\u2019t change it!\u201d\n\nAnd I\u2019m saying their definition is presupposing that it\u2019s absolute and applies to every cosmology, which it doesn\u2019t! Their definition is only right when a verse utilizes that type of destiny, and again, I never disagreed with that definition, I\u2019m just saying they used that definition under a false premise because they\u2019re assuming that their definition of destiny should apply in a singularity, which it doesn\u2019t because like I said, not every verse uses this definition of destiny.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s a contradiction\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s circular reasoning. I\u2019ve already presented to you why it wouldn\u2019t be a contradiction, it would simply just be a tautological thing that exists fundamentally the same amongst other interpretations. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fate in the first place\u201d\n\n- You\u2019re presupposing that your definition of fate is absolute and should apply as a tautologically objective thing amongst every possible world that holds zero inconsistencies (the fact that not every verse uses your definition negates this premise)\n\n- You\u2019re assuming that there is one interpretation of fate that should be held to a higher regard \n\n- You\u2019re also assuming that it can\u2019t be be fate by virtue of your definition, so how would you justify this?\n\nAgain, I\u2019d just argue that not every verse uses this interpretation, thus your argument is negated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m downvoting\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s already an L for you and shows me that you\u2019re insecure about yourself as well as your reasoning. \n\n\u201cYou talk like you\u2019re right\u201d\n\n- You\u2019re presupposing that I talk like I\u2019m right (I don\u2019t, I\u2019m just taking down your argument because it is inherently wrong, LMFAO)\n\n- You\u2019re assuming that me teaching people about why they\u2019re wrong means I think I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s right (I don\u2019t btw, you\u2019re just weird)\n\n\u201cAnd you can\u2019t even understand their definition\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve already established that I accept their definition, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s built on a false premise by virtue of it not being applicable on every foundation of knowledge. \n\nAnd no, that\u2019s not even a proof by contradiction, I established that earlier.  You\u2019re actually misinterpreting my argument and repeating the same stuff you said earlier, so I\u2019ll take this as a burden of rejoinder on your end via running away from standard dialect and not being able to justify a position (Hitchen\u2019s razor negates practically every assertion you\u2019ve made thus far, lol).",

It may not always let you beat the guys with immense gifts, but you can at least be a viable shinobi. Which is why Guy said to Lee, even after losing to Gaara, that he\u2019s already proven his ninja way. He\u2019s become a splendid Shinobi even with his handicaps. \n\nLee gave Gaara a a great fight, as did Guy give Madara a great fight. \n\nWith your Kakashi vs Guy point, there\u2019s always the dual MS perfect Susanoo version of Kakashi lol. \n\n\nHere\u2019s what Kishi himself says about the [theme](https://ibb.co/546mxd5). He was never pushing the theme that hard work > talent/gifts (nor would it make sense to, given his main character has a giant demon inside him, was stated to have potential to be better than all Hokage in chapter 1), but rather, that hard work pays off",

I stopped at 150 (only had 150 episodes) and refused to watch anymore because it was bad. \n\nGaara as a character is still great. His hair though.  .  .\n\nNerfing Naruto makes sense for the story since boruto is supposed to be the hero (even if he has no hope of actually beating ishikki since Naruto at half strength was stronger then his main power so at full strength hes like double boruto at full power) but nerfing him from the start of the series with no explanation on how he got so weak or why he did (its worse in the anime) then the way he canonically gets nerfed with the lose of kurama is just bullshit. How the hell did he learn nuclear fusion?  Has it even been invented yet in Narutos time? If so, how the hell does kurama know it? He's been presumably sleeping for like 1k years and waking up every once inawhile when he's disturbed. \n\nI liked the 9 tails Chakra cloak because it looked cool. Especially 6path sage mode Chakra cloak. \n\nThe red Chakra cloak with just pure 9 tails Chakra is the exact same as 2 tails and up. Shukaku transformations are different since he only has 1 tail.",

Claiming it\u2019s a proof by contradiction without actually justifying why it is doesn\u2019t make it a proof by contradiction, plus it doesn\u2019t fit within the context of what was originally said. \n\n\u201cIn logic and mathematics, proof by contradiction is a form of proof that establishes the truth or the validity of a proposition, by showing that assuming the proposition to be false leads to a contradiction.\u201d\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction\n\nThis presupposes that the validity of a statement leads to a contradiction, but there is no contradiction in a work of fiction demonstrating that destiny can be altered, that would simply just mean that\u2019s how the cosmology operates, plus you would have to give a reason for why your definition of destiny is true by virtue of applying the law of identity to verify that it is identical to itself and has no external interference.\n\n\u201cThe premise isn\u2019t wrong\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s asserted without evidence gets dismissed without evidence.  I\u2019ve already told you why it\u2019s wrong.   Claiming that if destiny is altered, therefore it never existed to begin with is a massively incorrect premise to start with, because it presupposes that their definition of \u201cdestiny\u201d is the most valued definition tautologically, and that destiny operates the same across every fictional verse, which is their burden to prove.  The fact that you already agreed that some verses utilize destiny by virtue of altering it makes their argument and your argument a self-defeater, because you just conceded that destiny isn\u2019t an absolute term that has one singular interpretation, plus there\u2019s the fact that if you are inherently manipulating destiny, destiny had to be present for said manipulation, unless you want to argue they are manipulating nothing at all, lol.\n\n\u201cDefinitions don\u2019t need to be demonstrated\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s asserted without evidence gets dismissed without evidence.  You need to justify this claim.  And yes, you do need to in a setting where dialect is taking place, because not every mind is contingent upon a singularity, so you\u2019d have to prove there is some sort of absolute meaning and interpretation for Destiny in order for me to acknowledge that definitions don\u2019t need to be demonstrated. \n\n\u201cIs valid and a logical consequence\u201d\n\nSure, that could apply to a cosmology if that\u2019s how they use destiny/fate.  That\u2019s not an absolute definition though, and my definition of destiny within a work of fiction is essentially someone capable of operating under the sequence of events that controls their actions, or someone capable of altering events and/or sequences.  These are both true statements via the law of identity (eg. \u201cIt is snowing\u201d <<< this is a true statement if it is actually snowing, hence \u2018X is X\u2019, so my definition and your definition have no inconsistencies or faulty reasoning, so they can both be applied). \n\n\u201cPeople can\u2019t change it!\u201d\n\nAnd I\u2019m saying their definition is presupposing that it\u2019s absolute and applies to every cosmology, which it doesn\u2019t! Their definition is only right when a verse utilizes that type of destiny, and again, I never disagreed with that definition, I\u2019m just saying they used that definition under a false premise because they\u2019re assuming that their definition of destiny should apply in a singularity, which it doesn\u2019t because like I said, not every verse uses this definition of destiny.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s a contradiction\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s circular reasoning. I\u2019ve already presented to you why it wouldn\u2019t be a contradiction, it would simply just be a tautological thing that exists fundamentally the same amongst other interpretations. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fate in the first place\u201d\n\n- You\u2019re presupposing that your definition of fate is absolute and should apply as a tautologically objective thing amongst every possible world that holds zero inconsistencies (the fact that not every verse uses your definition negates this premise)\n\n- You\u2019re assuming that there is one interpretation of fate that should be held to a higher regard \n\n- You\u2019re also assuming that it can\u2019t be be fate by virtue of your definition, so how would you justify this?\n\nAgain, I\u2019d just argue that not every verse uses this interpretation, thus your argument is negated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m downvoting\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s already an L for you and shows me that you\u2019re insecure about yourself as well as your reasoning. \n\n\u201cYou talk like you\u2019re right\u201d\n\n- You\u2019re presupposing that I talk like I\u2019m right (I don\u2019t, I\u2019m just taking down your argument because it is inherently wrong, LMFAO)\n\n- You\u2019re assuming that me teaching people about why they\u2019re wrong means I think I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s right (I don\u2019t btw, you\u2019re just weird)\n\n\u201cAnd you can\u2019t even understand their definition\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve already established that I accept their definition, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s built on a false premise by virtue of it not being applicable on every foundation of knowledge. \n\nAnd no, that\u2019s not even a proof by contradiction, I established that earlier.  You\u2019re actually misinterpreting my argument and repeating the same stuff you said earlier, so I\u2019ll take this as a burden of rejoinder on your end via running away from standard dialect and not being able to justify a position (Hitchen\u2019s razor negates practically every assertion you\u2019ve made thus far, lol).",

I stopped at 150 (only had 150 episodes) and refused to watch anymore because it was bad. \n\nGaara as a character is still great. His hair though.  .  .\n\nNerfing Naruto makes sense for the story since boruto is supposed to be the hero (even if he has no hope of actually beating ishikki since Naruto at half strength was stronger then his main power so at full strength hes like double boruto at full power) but nerfing him from the start of the series with no explanation on how he got so weak or why he did (its worse in the anime) then the way he canonically gets nerfed with the lose of kurama is just bullshit. How the hell did he learn nuclear fusion?  Has it even been invented yet in Narutos time? If so, how the hell does kurama know it? He's been presumably sleeping for like 1k years and waking up every once inawhile when he's disturbed. \n\nI liked the 9 tails Chakra cloak because it looked cool. Especially 6path sage mode Chakra cloak. \n\nThe red Chakra cloak with just pure 9 tails Chakra is the exact same as 2 tails and up. Shukaku transformations are different since he only has 1 tail.",

Claiming it\u2019s a proof by contradiction without actually justifying why it is doesn\u2019t make it a proof by contradiction, plus it doesn\u2019t fit within the context of what was originally said. \n\n\u201cIn logic and mathematics, proof by contradiction is a form of proof that establishes the truth or the validity of a proposition, by showing that assuming the proposition to be false leads to a contradiction.\u201d\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction\n\nThis presupposes that the validity of a statement leads to a contradiction, but there is no contradiction in a work of fiction demonstrating that destiny can be altered, that would simply just mean that\u2019s how the cosmology operates, plus you would have to give a reason for why your definition of destiny is true by virtue of applying the law of identity to verify that it is identical to itself and has no external interference.\n\n\u201cThe premise isn\u2019t wrong\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s asserted without evidence gets dismissed without evidence.  I\u2019ve already told you why it\u2019s wrong.   Claiming that if destiny is altered, therefore it never existed to begin with is a massively incorrect premise to start with, because it presupposes that their definition of \u201cdestiny\u201d is the most valued definition tautologically, and that destiny operates the same across every fictional verse, which is their burden to prove.  The fact that you already agreed that some verses utilize destiny by virtue of altering it makes their argument and your argument a self-defeater, because you just conceded that destiny isn\u2019t an absolute term that has one singular interpretation, plus there\u2019s the fact that if you are inherently manipulating destiny, destiny had to be present for said manipulation, unless you want to argue they are manipulating nothing at all, lol.\n\n\u201cDefinitions don\u2019t need to be demonstrated\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s asserted without evidence gets dismissed without evidence.  You need to justify this claim.  And yes, you do need to in a setting where dialect is taking place, because not every mind is contingent upon a singularity, so you\u2019d have to prove there is some sort of absolute meaning and interpretation for Destiny in order for me to acknowledge that definitions don\u2019t need to be demonstrated. \n\n\u201cIs valid and a logical consequence\u201d\n\nSure, that could apply to a cosmology if that\u2019s how they use destiny/fate.  That\u2019s not an absolute definition though, and my definition of destiny within a work of fiction is essentially someone capable of operating under the sequence of events that controls their actions, or someone capable of altering events and/or sequences.  These are both true statements via the law of identity (eg. \u201cIt is snowing\u201d <<< this is a true statement if it is actually snowing, hence \u2018X is X\u2019, so my definition and your definition have no inconsistencies or faulty reasoning, so they can both be applied). \n\n\u201cPeople can\u2019t change it!\u201d\n\nAnd I\u2019m saying their definition is presupposing that it\u2019s absolute and applies to every cosmology, which it doesn\u2019t! Their definition is only right when a verse utilizes that type of destiny, and again, I never disagreed with that definition, I\u2019m just saying they used that definition under a false premise because they\u2019re assuming that their definition of destiny should apply in a singularity, which it doesn\u2019t because like I said, not every verse uses this definition of destiny.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s a contradiction\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s circular reasoning. I\u2019ve already presented to you why it wouldn\u2019t be a contradiction, it would simply just be a tautological thing that exists fundamentally the same amongst other interpretations. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fate in the first place\u201d\n\n- You\u2019re presupposing that your definition of fate is absolute and should apply as a tautologically objective thing amongst every possible world that holds zero inconsistencies (the fact that not every verse uses your definition negates this premise)\n\n- You\u2019re assuming that there is one interpretation of fate that should be held to a higher regard \n\n- You\u2019re also assuming that it can\u2019t be be fate by virtue of your definition, so how would you justify this?\n\nAgain, I\u2019d just argue that not every verse uses this interpretation, thus your argument is negated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m downvoting\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s already an L for you and shows me that you\u2019re insecure about yourself as well as your reasoning. \n\n\u201cYou talk like you\u2019re right\u201d\n\n- You\u2019re presupposing that I talk like I\u2019m right (I don\u2019t, I\u2019m just taking down your argument because it is inherently wrong, LMFAO)\n\n- You\u2019re assuming that me teaching people about why they\u2019re wrong means I think I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s right (I don\u2019t btw, you\u2019re just weird)\n\n\u201cAnd you can\u2019t even understand their definition\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve already established that I accept their definition, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s built on a false premise by virtue of it not being applicable on every foundation of knowledge. \n\nAnd no, that\u2019s not even a proof by contradiction, I established that earlier.  You\u2019re actually misinterpreting my argument and repeating the same stuff you said earlier, so I\u2019ll take this as a burden of rejoinder on your end via running away from standard dialect and not being able to justify a position (Hitchen\u2019s razor negates practically every assertion you\u2019ve made thus far, lol).",

I stopped at 150 (only had 150 episodes) and refused to watch anymore because it was bad. \n\nGaara as a character is still great. His hair though.  .  .\n\nNerfing Naruto makes sense for the story since boruto is supposed to be the hero (even if he has no hope of actually beating ishikki since Naruto at half strength was stronger then his main power so at full strength hes like double boruto at full power) but nerfing him from the start of the series with no explanation on how he got so weak or why he did (its worse in the anime) then the way he canonically gets nerfed with the lose of kurama is just bullshit. How the hell did he learn nuclear fusion?  Has it even been invented yet in Narutos time? If so, how the hell does kurama know it? He's been presumably sleeping for like 1k years and waking up every once inawhile when he's disturbed. \n\nI liked the 9 tails Chakra cloak because it looked cool. Especially 6path sage mode Chakra cloak. \n\nThe red Chakra cloak with just pure 9 tails Chakra is the exact same as 2 tails and up. Shukaku transformations are different since he only has 1 tail.",

You also said \u201cit\u2019s just logic,\u201d so now it\u2019s your burden to fulfill which type of logic system this is referring to.

Claiming it\u2019s a proof by contradiction without actually justifying why it is doesn\u2019t make it a proof by contradiction, plus it doesn\u2019t fit within the context of what was originally said. \n\n\u201cIn logic and mathematics, proof by contradiction is a form of proof that establishes the truth or the validity of a proposition, by showing that assuming the proposition to be false leads to a contradiction.\u201d\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction\n\nThis presupposes that the validity of a statement leads to a contradiction, but there is no contradiction in a work of fiction demonstrating that destiny can be altered, that would simply just mean that\u2019s how the cosmology operates, plus you would have to give a reason for why your definition of destiny is true by virtue of applying the law of identity to verify that it is identical to itself and has no external interference.\n\n\u201cThe premise isn\u2019t wrong\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s asserted without evidence gets dismissed without evidence.  I\u2019ve already told you why it\u2019s wrong.   Claiming that if destiny is altered, therefore it never existed to begin with is a massively incorrect premise to start with, because it presupposes that their definition of \u201cdestiny\u201d is the most valued definition tautologically, and that destiny operates the same across every fictional verse, which is their burden to prove.  The fact that you already agreed that some verses utilize destiny by virtue of altering it makes their argument and your argument a self-defeater, because you just conceded that destiny isn\u2019t an absolute term that has one singular interpretation, plus there\u2019s the fact that if you are inherently manipulating destiny, destiny had to be present for said manipulation, unless you want to argue they are manipulating nothing at all, lol.\n\n\u201cDefinitions don\u2019t need to be demonstrated\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s asserted without evidence gets dismissed without evidence.  You need to justify this claim.  And yes, you do need to in a setting where dialect is taking place, because not every mind is contingent upon a singularity, so you\u2019d have to prove there is some sort of absolute meaning and interpretation for Destiny in order for me to acknowledge that definitions don\u2019t need to be demonstrated. \n\n\u201cIs valid and a logical consequence\u201d\n\nSure, that could apply to a cosmology if that\u2019s how they use destiny/fate.  That\u2019s not an absolute definition though, and my definition of destiny within a work of fiction is essentially someone capable of operating under the sequence of events that controls their actions, or someone capable of altering events and/or sequences.  These are both true statements via the law of identity (eg. \u201cIt is snowing\u201d <<< this is a true statement if it is actually snowing, hence \u2018X is X\u2019, so my definition and your definition have no inconsistencies or faulty reasoning, so they can both be applied). \n\n\u201cPeople can\u2019t change it!\u201d\n\nAnd I\u2019m saying their definition is presupposing that it\u2019s absolute and applies to every cosmology, which it doesn\u2019t! Their definition is only right when a verse utilizes that type of destiny, and again, I never disagreed with that definition, I\u2019m just saying they used that definition under a false premise because they\u2019re assuming that their definition of destiny should apply in a singularity, which it doesn\u2019t because like I said, not every verse uses this definition of destiny.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s a contradiction\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s circular reasoning. I\u2019ve already presented to you why it wouldn\u2019t be a contradiction, it would simply just be a tautological thing that exists fundamentally the same amongst other interpretations. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fate in the first place\u201d\n\n- You\u2019re presupposing that your definition of fate is absolute and should apply as a tautologically objective thing amongst every possible world that holds zero inconsistencies (the fact that not every verse uses your definition negates this premise)\n\n- You\u2019re assuming that there is one interpretation of fate that should be held to a higher regard \n\n- You\u2019re also assuming that it can\u2019t be be fate by virtue of your definition, so how would you justify this?\n\nAgain, I\u2019d just argue that not every verse uses this interpretation, thus your argument is negated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m downvoting\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s already an L for you and shows me that you\u2019re insecure about yourself as well as your reasoning. \n\n\u201cYou talk like you\u2019re right\u201d\n\n- You\u2019re presupposing that I talk like I\u2019m right (I don\u2019t, I\u2019m just taking down your argument because it is inherently wrong, LMFAO)\n\n- You\u2019re assuming that me teaching people about why they\u2019re wrong means I think I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s right (I don\u2019t btw, you\u2019re just weird)\n\n\u201cAnd you can\u2019t even understand their definition\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve already established that I accept their definition, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s built on a false premise by virtue of it not being applicable on every foundation of knowledge. \n\nAnd no, that\u2019s not even a proof by contradiction, I established that earlier.  You\u2019re actually misinterpreting my argument and repeating the same stuff you said earlier, so I\u2019ll take this as a burden of rejoinder on your end via running away from standard dialect and not being able to justify a position (Hitchen\u2019s razor negates practically every assertion you\u2019ve made thus far, lol).",

How the hell did he learn nuclear fusion?  Has it even been invented yet in Narutos time? If so, how the hell does kurama know it? He's been presumably sleeping for like 1k years and waking up every once inawhile when he's disturbed. \n\nI liked the 9 tails Chakra cloak because it looked cool. Especially 6path sage mode Chakra cloak. \n\nThe red Chakra cloak with just pure 9 tails Chakra is the exact same as 2 tails and up. Shukaku transformations are different since he only has 1 tail.",

Claiming it\u2019s a proof by contradiction without actually justifying why it is doesn\u2019t make it a proof by contradiction, plus it doesn\u2019t fit within the context of what was originally said. \n\n\u201cIn logic and mathematics, proof by contradiction is a form of proof that establishes the truth or the validity of a proposition, by showing that assuming the proposition to be false leads to a contradiction.\u201d\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction\n\nThis presupposes that the validity of a statement leads to a contradiction, but there is no contradiction in a work of fiction demonstrating that destiny can be altered, that would simply just mean that\u2019s how the cosmology operates, plus you would have to give a reason for why your definition of destiny is true by virtue of applying the law of identity to verify that it is identical to itself and has no external interference.\n\n\u201cThe premise isn\u2019t wrong\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s asserted without evidence gets dismissed without evidence.  I\u2019ve already told you why it\u2019s wrong.   Claiming that if destiny is altered, therefore it never existed to begin with is a massively incorrect premise to start with, because it presupposes that their definition of \u201cdestiny\u201d is the most valued definition tautologically, and that destiny operates the same across every fictional verse, which is their burden to prove.  The fact that you already agreed that some verses utilize destiny by virtue of altering it makes their argument and your argument a self-defeater, because you just conceded that destiny isn\u2019t an absolute term that has one singular interpretation, plus there\u2019s the fact that if you are inherently manipulating destiny, destiny had to be present for said manipulation, unless you want to argue they are manipulating nothing at all, lol.\n\n\u201cDefinitions don\u2019t need to be demonstrated\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s asserted without evidence gets dismissed without evidence.  You need to justify this claim.  And yes, you do need to in a setting where dialect is taking place, because not every mind is contingent upon a singularity, so you\u2019d have to prove there is some sort of absolute meaning and interpretation for Destiny in order for me to acknowledge that definitions don\u2019t need to be demonstrated. \n\n\u201cIs valid and a logical consequence\u201d\n\nSure, that could apply to a cosmology if that\u2019s how they use destiny/fate.  That\u2019s not an absolute definition though, and my definition of destiny within a work of fiction is essentially someone capable of operating under the sequence of events that controls their actions, or someone capable of altering events and/or sequences.  These are both true statements via the law of identity (eg. \u201cIt is snowing\u201d <<< this is a true statement if it is actually snowing, hence \u2018X is X\u2019, so my definition and your definition have no inconsistencies or faulty reasoning, so they can both be applied). \n\n\u201cPeople can\u2019t change it!\u201d\n\nAnd I\u2019m saying their definition is presupposing that it\u2019s absolute and applies to every cosmology, which it doesn\u2019t! Their definition is only right when a verse utilizes that type of destiny, and again, I never disagreed with that definition, I\u2019m just saying they used that definition under a false premise because they\u2019re assuming that their definition of destiny should apply in a singularity, which it doesn\u2019t because like I said, not every verse uses this definition of destiny.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s a contradiction\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s circular reasoning. I\u2019ve already presented to you why it wouldn\u2019t be a contradiction, it would simply just be a tautological thing that exists fundamentally the same amongst other interpretations. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fate in the first place\u201d\n\n- You\u2019re presupposing that your definition of fate is absolute and should apply as a tautologically objective thing amongst every possible world that holds zero inconsistencies (the fact that not every verse uses your definition negates this premise)\n\n- You\u2019re assuming that there is one interpretation of fate that should be held to a higher regard \n\n- You\u2019re also assuming that it can\u2019t be be fate by virtue of your definition, so how would you justify this?\n\nAgain, I\u2019d just argue that not every verse uses this interpretation, thus your argument is negated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m downvoting\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s already an L for you and shows me that you\u2019re insecure about yourself as well as your reasoning. \n\n\u201cYou talk like you\u2019re right\u201d\n\n- You\u2019re presupposing that I talk like I\u2019m right (I don\u2019t, I\u2019m just taking down your argument because it is inherently wrong, LMFAO)\n\n- You\u2019re assuming that me teaching people about why they\u2019re wrong means I think I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s right (I don\u2019t btw, you\u2019re just weird)\n\n\u201cAnd you can\u2019t even understand their definition\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve already established that I accept their definition, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s built on a false premise by virtue of it not being applicable on every foundation of knowledge. \n\nAnd no, that\u2019s not even a proof by contradiction, I established that earlier.  You\u2019re actually misinterpreting my argument and repeating the same stuff you said earlier, so I\u2019ll take this as a burden of rejoinder on your end via running away from standard dialect and not being able to justify a position (Hitchen\u2019s razor negates practically every assertion you\u2019ve made thus far, lol).",

How the hell did he learn nuclear fusion?  Has it even been invented yet in Narutos time? If so, how the hell does kurama know it? He's been presumably sleeping for like 1k years and waking up every once inawhile when he's disturbed. \n\nI liked the 9 tails Chakra cloak because it looked cool. Especially 6path sage mode Chakra cloak. \n\nThe red Chakra cloak with just pure 9 tails Chakra is the exact same as 2 tails and up. Shukaku transformations are different since he only has 1 tail.",

They are essentially saying that changing your destiny entails that destiny doesn\u2019t exist, but in order to change destiny, it must be prevalent in existence in order for it to be altered, which already negates everything you\u2019ve been saying so far, lmfaoooo.\n\n\u201cWith others this can\u2019t happen\u201d\n\nAgain, I\u2019ve never once disagreed with that, I\u2019m just countering the OP\u2019s claim that altering destiny entails that it doesn\u2019t exist.  That would need to be demonstrated throughout every work of fiction tautologically.  Destiny according to multiple sources inherently refers to events that will occur in the future which are usually identified to be unchangeable.  This doesn\u2019t always apply in fiction.  It\u2019s only the fact that their premise is wrong.  \n\nYou then stated that altering destiny arrives at a contradiction, which you haven\u2019t substantiated at all on why that\u2019s the case.  You also said \u201cit\u2019s just logic,\u201d so now it\u2019s your burden to fulfill which type of logic system this is referring to.  You also need to prove OP is consistent in their reasoning (they\u2019re only consistent in making self-defeaters, not sound arguments, lol). \n\nIn short, OP self-conceded and you haven\u2019t made any type of counter arguments besides repetitive claims that have been negated by the false premise of destiny being unchangeable, thus changing it creates a contradiction.\n\nAnd imagine downvoting because you\u2019re bad at reasoning.",

Claiming it\u2019s a proof by contradiction without actually justifying why it is doesn\u2019t make it a proof by contradiction, plus it doesn\u2019t fit within the context of what was originally said. \n\n\u201cIn logic and mathematics, proof by contradiction is a form of proof that establishes the truth or the validity of a proposition, by showing that assuming the proposition to be false leads to a contradiction.\u201d\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction\n\nThis presupposes that the validity of a statement leads to a contradiction, but there is no contradiction in a work of fiction demonstrating that destiny can be altered, that would simply just mean that\u2019s how the cosmology operates, plus you would have to give a reason for why your definition of destiny is true by virtue of applying the law of identity to verify that it is identical to itself and has no external interference.\n\n\u201cThe premise isn\u2019t wrong\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s asserted without evidence gets dismissed without evidence.  I\u2019ve already told you why it\u2019s wrong.   Claiming that if destiny is altered, therefore it never existed to begin with is a massively incorrect premise to start with, because it presupposes that their definition of \u201cdestiny\u201d is the most valued definition tautologically, and that destiny operates the same across every fictional verse, which is their burden to prove.  The fact that you already agreed that some verses utilize destiny by virtue of altering it makes their argument and your argument a self-defeater, because you just conceded that destiny isn\u2019t an absolute term that has one singular interpretation, plus there\u2019s the fact that if you are inherently manipulating destiny, destiny had to be present for said manipulation, unless you want to argue they are manipulating nothing at all, lol.\n\n\u201cDefinitions don\u2019t need to be demonstrated\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s asserted without evidence gets dismissed without evidence.  You need to justify this claim.  And yes, you do need to in a setting where dialect is taking place, because not every mind is contingent upon a singularity, so you\u2019d have to prove there is some sort of absolute meaning and interpretation for Destiny in order for me to acknowledge that definitions don\u2019t need to be demonstrated. \n\n\u201cIs valid and a logical consequence\u201d\n\nSure, that could apply to a cosmology if that\u2019s how they use destiny/fate.  That\u2019s not an absolute definition though, and my definition of destiny within a work of fiction is essentially someone capable of operating under the sequence of events that controls their actions, or someone capable of altering events and/or sequences.  These are both true statements via the law of identity (eg. \u201cIt is snowing\u201d <<< this is a true statement if it is actually snowing, hence \u2018X is X\u2019, so my definition and your definition have no inconsistencies or faulty reasoning, so they can both be applied). \n\n\u201cPeople can\u2019t change it!\u201d\n\nAnd I\u2019m saying their definition is presupposing that it\u2019s absolute and applies to every cosmology, which it doesn\u2019t! Their definition is only right when a verse utilizes that type of destiny, and again, I never disagreed with that definition, I\u2019m just saying they used that definition under a false premise because they\u2019re assuming that their definition of destiny should apply in a singularity, which it doesn\u2019t because like I said, not every verse uses this definition of destiny.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s a contradiction\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s circular reasoning. I\u2019ve already presented to you why it wouldn\u2019t be a contradiction, it would simply just be a tautological thing that exists fundamentally the same amongst other interpretations. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fate in the first place\u201d\n\n- You\u2019re presupposing that your definition of fate is absolute and should apply as a tautologically objective thing amongst every possible world that holds zero inconsistencies (the fact that not every verse uses your definition negates this premise)\n\n- You\u2019re assuming that there is one interpretation of fate that should be held to a higher regard \n\n- You\u2019re also assuming that it can\u2019t be be fate by virtue of your definition, so how would you justify this?\n\nAgain, I\u2019d just argue that not every verse uses this interpretation, thus your argument is negated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m downvoting\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s already an L for you and shows me that you\u2019re insecure about yourself as well as your reasoning. \n\n\u201cYou talk like you\u2019re right\u201d\n\n- You\u2019re presupposing that I talk like I\u2019m right (I don\u2019t, I\u2019m just taking down your argument because it is inherently wrong, LMFAO)\n\n- You\u2019re assuming that me teaching people about why they\u2019re wrong means I think I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s right (I don\u2019t btw, you\u2019re just weird)\n\n\u201cAnd you can\u2019t even understand their definition\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve already established that I accept their definition, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s built on a false premise by virtue of it not being applicable on every foundation of knowledge. \n\nAnd no, that\u2019s not even a proof by contradiction, I established that earlier.  You\u2019re actually misinterpreting my argument and repeating the same stuff you said earlier, so I\u2019ll take this as a burden of rejoinder on your end via running away from standard dialect and not being able to justify a position (Hitchen\u2019s razor negates practically every assertion you\u2019ve made thus far, lol).",

How the hell did he learn nuclear fusion?  Has it even been invented yet in Narutos time? If so, how the hell does kurama know it? He's been presumably sleeping for like 1k years and waking up every once inawhile when he's disturbed. \n\nI liked the 9 tails Chakra cloak because it looked cool.

Claiming it\u2019s a proof by contradiction without actually justifying why it is doesn\u2019t make it a proof by contradiction, plus it doesn\u2019t fit within the context of what was originally said. \n\n\u201cIn logic and mathematics, proof by contradiction is a form of proof that establishes the truth or the validity of a proposition, by showing that assuming the proposition to be false leads to a contradiction.\u201d\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction\n\nThis presupposes that the validity of a statement leads to a contradiction, but there is no contradiction in a work of fiction demonstrating that destiny can be altered, that would simply just mean that\u2019s how the cosmology operates, plus you would have to give a reason for why your definition of destiny is true by virtue of applying the law of identity to verify that it is identical to itself and has no external interference.\n\n\u201cThe premise isn\u2019t wrong\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s asserted without evidence gets dismissed without evidence.  I\u2019ve already told you why it\u2019s wrong.   Claiming that if destiny is altered, therefore it never existed to begin with is a massively incorrect premise to start with, because it presupposes that their definition of \u201cdestiny\u201d is the most valued definition tautologically, and that destiny operates the same across every fictional verse, which is their burden to prove.  The fact that you already agreed that some verses utilize destiny by virtue of altering it makes their argument and your argument a self-defeater, because you just conceded that destiny isn\u2019t an absolute term that has one singular interpretation, plus there\u2019s the fact that if you are inherently manipulating destiny, destiny had to be present for said manipulation, unless you want to argue they are manipulating nothing at all, lol.\n\n\u201cDefinitions don\u2019t need to be demonstrated\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s asserted without evidence gets dismissed without evidence.  You need to justify this claim.  And yes, you do need to in a setting where dialect is taking place, because not every mind is contingent upon a singularity, so you\u2019d have to prove there is some sort of absolute meaning and interpretation for Destiny in order for me to acknowledge that definitions don\u2019t need to be demonstrated. \n\n\u201cIs valid and a logical consequence\u201d\n\nSure, that could apply to a cosmology if that\u2019s how they use destiny/fate.  That\u2019s not an absolute definition though, and my definition of destiny within a work of fiction is essentially someone capable of operating under the sequence of events that controls their actions, or someone capable of altering events and/or sequences.  These are both true statements via the law of identity (eg. \u201cIt is snowing\u201d <<< this is a true statement if it is actually snowing, hence \u2018X is X\u2019, so my definition and your definition have no inconsistencies or faulty reasoning, so they can both be applied). \n\n\u201cPeople can\u2019t change it!\u201d\n\nAnd I\u2019m saying their definition is presupposing that it\u2019s absolute and applies to every cosmology, which it doesn\u2019t! Their definition is only right when a verse utilizes that type of destiny, and again, I never disagreed with that definition, I\u2019m just saying they used that definition under a false premise because they\u2019re assuming that their definition of destiny should apply in a singularity, which it doesn\u2019t because like I said, not every verse uses this definition of destiny.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s a contradiction\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s circular reasoning. I\u2019ve already presented to you why it wouldn\u2019t be a contradiction, it would simply just be a tautological thing that exists fundamentally the same amongst other interpretations. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fate in the first place\u201d\n\n- You\u2019re presupposing that your definition of fate is absolute and should apply as a tautologically objective thing amongst every possible world that holds zero inconsistencies (the fact that not every verse uses your definition negates this premise)\n\n- You\u2019re assuming that there is one interpretation of fate that should be held to a higher regard \n\n- You\u2019re also assuming that it can\u2019t be be fate by virtue of your definition, so how would you justify this?\n\nAgain, I\u2019d just argue that not every verse uses this interpretation, thus your argument is negated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m downvoting\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s already an L for you and shows me that you\u2019re insecure about yourself as well as your reasoning. \n\n\u201cYou talk like you\u2019re right\u201d\n\n- You\u2019re presupposing that I talk like I\u2019m right (I don\u2019t, I\u2019m just taking down your argument because it is inherently wrong, LMFAO)\n\n- You\u2019re assuming that me teaching people about why they\u2019re wrong means I think I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s right (I don\u2019t btw, you\u2019re just weird)\n\n\u201cAnd you can\u2019t even understand their definition\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve already established that I accept their definition, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s built on a false premise by virtue of it not being applicable on every foundation of knowledge. \n\nAnd no, that\u2019s not even a proof by contradiction, I established that earlier.  You\u2019re actually misinterpreting my argument and repeating the same stuff you said earlier, so I\u2019ll take this as a burden of rejoinder on your end via running away from standard dialect and not being able to justify a position (Hitchen\u2019s razor negates practically every assertion you\u2019ve made thus far, lol).",

Claiming it\u2019s a proof by contradiction without actually justifying why it is doesn\u2019t make it a proof by contradiction, plus it doesn\u2019t fit within the context of what was originally said. \n\n\u201cIn logic and mathematics, proof by contradiction is a form of proof that establishes the truth or the validity of a proposition, by showing that assuming the proposition to be false leads to a contradiction.\u201d\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction\n\nThis presupposes that the validity of a statement leads to a contradiction, but there is no contradiction in a work of fiction demonstrating that destiny can be altered, that would simply just mean that\u2019s how the cosmology operates, plus you would have to give a reason for why your definition of destiny is true by virtue of applying the law of identity to verify that it is identical to itself and has no external interference.\n\n\u201cThe premise isn\u2019t wrong\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s asserted without evidence gets dismissed without evidence.  I\u2019ve already told you why it\u2019s wrong.   Claiming that if destiny is altered, therefore it never existed to begin with is a massively incorrect premise to start with, because it presupposes that their definition of \u201cdestiny\u201d is the most valued definition tautologically, and that destiny operates the same across every fictional verse, which is their burden to prove.  The fact that you already agreed that some verses utilize destiny by virtue of altering it makes their argument and your argument a self-defeater, because you just conceded that destiny isn\u2019t an absolute term that has one singular interpretation, plus there\u2019s the fact that if you are inherently manipulating destiny, destiny had to be present for said manipulation, unless you want to argue they are manipulating nothing at all, lol.\n\n\u201cDefinitions don\u2019t need to be demonstrated\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s asserted without evidence gets dismissed without evidence.  You need to justify this claim.  And yes, you do need to in a setting where dialect is taking place, because not every mind is contingent upon a singularity, so you\u2019d have to prove there is some sort of absolute meaning and interpretation for Destiny in order for me to acknowledge that definitions don\u2019t need to be demonstrated. \n\n\u201cIs valid and a logical consequence\u201d\n\nSure, that could apply to a cosmology if that\u2019s how they use destiny/fate.  That\u2019s not an absolute definition though, and my definition of destiny within a work of fiction is essentially someone capable of operating under the sequence of events that controls their actions, or someone capable of altering events and/or sequences.  These are both true statements via the law of identity (eg. \u201cIt is snowing\u201d <<< this is a true statement if it is actually snowing, hence \u2018X is X\u2019, so my definition and your definition have no inconsistencies or faulty reasoning, so they can both be applied). \n\n\u201cPeople can\u2019t change it!\u201d\n\nAnd I\u2019m saying their definition is presupposing that it\u2019s absolute and applies to every cosmology, which it doesn\u2019t! Their definition is only right when a verse utilizes that type of destiny, and again, I never disagreed with that definition, I\u2019m just saying they used that definition under a false premise because they\u2019re assuming that their definition of destiny should apply in a singularity, which it doesn\u2019t because like I said, not every verse uses this definition of destiny.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s a contradiction\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s circular reasoning. I\u2019ve already presented to you why it wouldn\u2019t be a contradiction, it would simply just be a tautological thing that exists fundamentally the same amongst other interpretations. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fate in the first place\u201d\n\n- You\u2019re presupposing that your definition of fate is absolute and should apply as a tautologically objective thing amongst every possible world that holds zero inconsistencies (the fact that not every verse uses your definition negates this premise)\n\n- You\u2019re assuming that there is one interpretation of fate that should be held to a higher regard \n\n- You\u2019re also assuming that it can\u2019t be be fate by virtue of your definition, so how would you justify this?\n\nAgain, I\u2019d just argue that not every verse uses this interpretation, thus your argument is negated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m downvoting\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s already an L for you and shows me that you\u2019re insecure about yourself as well as your reasoning. \n\n\u201cYou talk like you\u2019re right\u201d\n\n- You\u2019re presupposing that I talk like I\u2019m right (I don\u2019t, I\u2019m just taking down your argument because it is inherently wrong, LMFAO)\n\n- You\u2019re assuming that me teaching people about why they\u2019re wrong means I think I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s right (I don\u2019t btw, you\u2019re just weird)\n\n\u201cAnd you can\u2019t even understand their definition\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve already established that I accept their definition, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s built on a false premise by virtue of it not being applicable on every foundation of knowledge. \n\nAnd no, that\u2019s not even a proof by contradiction, I established that earlier.  You\u2019re actually misinterpreting my argument and repeating the same stuff you said earlier, so I\u2019ll take this as a burden of rejoinder on your end via running away from standard dialect and not being able to justify a position (Hitchen\u2019s razor negates practically every assertion you\u2019ve made thus far, lol).",

                            "body": "1. Claiming it\u2019s a proof by contradiction without actually justifying why it is doesn\u2019t make it a proof by contradiction, plus it doesn\u2019t fit within the context of what was originally said. \n\n\u201cIn logic and mathematics, proof by contradiction is a form of proof that establishes the truth or the validity of a proposition, by showing that assuming the proposition to be false leads to a contradiction.\u201d\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction\n\nThis presupposes that the validity of a statement leads to a contradiction, but there is no contradiction in a work of fiction demonstrating that destiny can be altered, that would simply just mean that\u2019s how the cosmology operates, plus you would have to give a reason for why your definition of destiny is true by virtue of applying the law of identity to verify that it is identical to itself and has no external interference.\n\n\u201cThe premise isn\u2019t wrong\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s asserted without evidence gets dismissed without evidence.  I\u2019ve already told you why it\u2019s wrong.   Claiming that if destiny is altered, therefore it never existed to begin with is a massively incorrect premise to start with, because it presupposes that their definition of \u201cdestiny\u201d is the most valued definition tautologically, and that destiny operates the same across every fictional verse, which is their burden to prove.  The fact that you already agreed that some verses utilize destiny by virtue of altering it makes their argument and your argument a self-defeater, because you just conceded that destiny isn\u2019t an absolute term that has one singular interpretation, plus there\u2019s the fact that if you are inherently manipulating destiny, destiny had to be present for said manipulation, unless you want to argue they are manipulating nothing at all, lol.\n\n\u201cDefinitions don\u2019t need to be demonstrated\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s asserted without evidence gets dismissed without evidence.  You need to justify this claim.  And yes, you do need to in a setting where dialect is taking place, because not every mind is contingent upon a singularity, so you\u2019d have to prove there is some sort of absolute meaning and interpretation for Destiny in order for me to acknowledge that definitions don\u2019t need to be demonstrated. \n\n\u201cIs valid and a logical consequence\u201d\n\nSure, that could apply to a cosmology if that\u2019s how they use destiny/fate.  That\u2019s not an absolute definition though, and my definition of destiny within a work of fiction is essentially someone capable of operating under the sequence of events that controls their actions, or someone capable of altering events and/or sequences.  These are both true statements via the law of identity (eg. \u201cIt is snowing\u201d <<< this is a true statement if it is actually snowing, hence \u2018X is X\u2019, so my definition and your definition have no inconsistencies or faulty reasoning, so they can both be applied). \n\n\u201cPeople can\u2019t change it!\u201d\n\nAnd I\u2019m saying their definition is presupposing that it\u2019s absolute and applies to every cosmology, which it doesn\u2019t! Their definition is only right when a verse utilizes that type of destiny, and again, I never disagreed with that definition, I\u2019m just saying they used that definition under a false premise because they\u2019re assuming that their definition of destiny should apply in a singularity, which it doesn\u2019t because like I said, not every verse uses this definition of destiny.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s a contradiction\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s circular reasoning. I\u2019ve already presented to you why it wouldn\u2019t be a contradiction, it would simply just be a tautological thing that exists fundamentally the same amongst other interpretations. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fate in the first place\u201d\n\n- You\u2019re presupposing that your definition of fate is absolute and should apply as a tautologically objective thing amongst every possible world that holds zero inconsistencies (the fact that not every verse uses your definition negates this premise)\n\n- You\u2019re assuming that there is one interpretation of fate that should be held to a higher regard \n\n- You\u2019re also assuming that it can\u2019t be be fate by virtue of your definition, so how would you justify this?\n\nAgain, I\u2019d just argue that not every verse uses this interpretation, thus your argument is negated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m downvoting\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s already an L for you and shows me that you\u2019re insecure about yourself as well as your reasoning. \n\n\u201cYou talk like you\u2019re right\u201d\n\n- You\u2019re presupposing that I talk like I\u2019m right (I don\u2019t, I\u2019m just taking down your argument because it is inherently wrong, LMFAO)\n\n- You\u2019re assuming that me teaching people about why they\u2019re wrong means I think I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s right (I don\u2019t btw, you\u2019re just weird)\n\n\u201cAnd you can\u2019t even understand their definition\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve already established that I accept their definition, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s built on a false premise by virtue of it not being applicable on every foundation of knowledge. \n\nAnd no, that\u2019s not even a proof by contradiction, I established that earlier.  You\u2019re actually misinterpreting my argument and repeating the same stuff you said earlier, so I\u2019ll take this as a burden of rejoinder on your end via running away from standard dialect and not being able to justify a position (Hitchen\u2019s razor negates practically every assertion you\u2019ve made thus far, lol).",

Claiming it\u2019s a proof by contradiction without actually justifying why it is doesn\u2019t make it a proof by contradiction, plus it doesn\u2019t fit within the context of what was originally said. \n\n\u201cIn logic and mathematics, proof by contradiction is a form of proof that establishes the truth or the validity of a proposition, by showing that assuming the proposition to be false leads to a contradiction.\u201d\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction\n\nThis presupposes that the validity of a statement leads to a contradiction, but there is no contradiction in a work of fiction demonstrating that destiny can be altered, that would simply just mean that\u2019s how the cosmology operates, plus you would have to give a reason for why your definition of destiny is true by virtue of applying the law of identity to verify that it is identical to itself and has no external interference.\n\n\u201cThe premise isn\u2019t wrong\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s asserted without evidence gets dismissed without evidence.
