Also, I find it funny that you just brush off the fact that I mentioned \"hitting others\" as one of the \"repetitive\" things. Which is something done mostly by Kwang Soo that is definitely in the same realm as what you call a \"specific bit that's been happening for too long.\" Thats why I mentioned the Kwang Soo fans in my first comments. If he does something like that, no one bats an eye. But when other members does it suddenly its world war 3.

But it's not becuz there's diff ways of doing that concepts while making it interesting. However this one case is not a general idea, it's a specific bit that's been happening for so long. It was funny and still kinda is, but u start losing the humor in it after a while",

Which is something done mostly by Kwang Soo that is definitely in the same realm as what you call a \"specific bit that's been happening for too long.\" Thats why I mentioned the Kwang Soo fans in my first comments. If he does something like that, no one bats an eye. But when other members does it suddenly its world war 3.
