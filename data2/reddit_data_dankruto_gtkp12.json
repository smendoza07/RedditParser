He let everyone hate Naruto and basically isolate him, which isn't his (Hiruzen) fault, cuz a person can't just erase everyone's fear and hatred from a devastating attack. Hiruzen had the Anbu also look out for Naruto and insured he never got hurt (like anyone would've noticed a little kid on Ninja Rushmore throwing paint around 5 seconds after he started, so its obvious Hiruzen and the Anbu let him do it, and kept their eyes on him). \n\nEveryone shits on Hiruzen for letting Naruto grow up in a small one room house alone and poor, with expired food. Granted that was messed up on his end, I still don't see what Hiruzen did wrong. All villages hated their Jinchuurikis. And as stated, Hiruzen can't just wipe away everyone's hatred and fear just cuz he's Hokage. And if Hiruzen didn't let Naruto face difficulties, then Naruto wouldn't have strived as hard as he did to become stronger and accepted by everyone. He also wouldn't be able to connect to the other Jinchuurikis and even villains with his talk no jutsu. His isolation is also what made him connect with Sasuke a lot.",

They all had such a huge role to play in the story, but because of the fact that we see so little of them, they feel like mcguffins. \n\n\n\nHell we don't even see a jinchuriki aside from Gaara in the entire first series do we? We know they exist, as Naruto and Gaara have the nine and one tails, so there are seven others.

Second which orochimaru points out \"but you're the one who drove the uchiha to it second hokage...it could be said that the seeds got sown with the uchiha police force that you created\" then he went on to say \"those who crack down on crime tend to be easily disliked. plus the more authority such a group has the more conceited it can get. by building the police station next to the prison under the pretext of facilitating the monitoring of criminals...you conspicuously shoved the uchiha clan to the margins of the village that helped foster the madara adherents\" so maybe tobirama was right about the uchiha. A clan that possessed such power mainly through hatred and pain would mean trouble but handling it in the way he did left its mark. Plus I kinda just dislike his personality in general.

He's a powerful sensor and continuously compared Naruto to Hashirama.\n\nOrochimaru is a criminal and a liar and he wasn't even alive in Tobirama's time. Naruto's world is a traditional society and leaders and protectors are loved there. There is no way police force would be hated unless everyone is a criminal like Orochimaru.\nChapter 399 makes it perfectly clear that it was Danzo who drove the Uchiha into the corner of the village.\n\nIf Tobirama had truly wanted these volatile clan hated, he would have made Curse of Hatred public knowledge. His findings were so scientific and convincing that even idealistic Hashirama couldn't dispute them.\n\nTobirama was the only Hokage who did everything right and he also stands out in terms of personality and appearance.",

He let everyone hate Naruto and basically isolate him, which isn't his (Hiruzen) fault, cuz a person can't just erase everyone's fear and hatred from a devastating attack. Hiruzen had the Anbu also look out for Naruto and insured he never got hurt (like anyone would've noticed a little kid on Ninja Rushmore throwing paint around 5 seconds after he started, so its obvious Hiruzen and the Anbu let him do it, and kept their eyes on him). \n\nEveryone shits on Hiruzen for letting Naruto grow up in a small one room house alone and poor, with expired food. Granted that was messed up on his end, I still don't see what Hiruzen did wrong. All villages hated their Jinchuurikis. And as stated, Hiruzen can't just wipe away everyone's hatred and fear just cuz he's Hokage. And if Hiruzen didn't let Naruto face difficulties, then Naruto wouldn't have strived as hard as he did to become stronger and accepted by everyone. He also wouldn't be able to connect to the other Jinchuurikis and even villains with his talk no jutsu. His isolation is also what made him connect with Sasuke a lot.",

They all had such a huge role to play in the story, but because of the fact that we see so little of them, they feel like mcguffins. \n\n\n\nHell we don't even see a jinchuriki aside from Gaara in the entire first series do we? We know they exist, as Naruto and Gaara have the nine and one tails, so there are seven others.

He's a powerful sensor and continuously compared Naruto to Hashirama.\n\nOrochimaru is a criminal and a liar and he wasn't even alive in Tobirama's time. Naruto's world is a traditional society and leaders and protectors are loved there. There is no way police force would be hated unless everyone is a criminal like Orochimaru.\nChapter 399 makes it perfectly clear that it was Danzo who drove the Uchiha into the corner of the village.\n\nIf Tobirama had truly wanted these volatile clan hated, he would have made Curse of Hatred public knowledge. His findings were so scientific and convincing that even idealistic Hashirama couldn't dispute them.\n\nTobirama was the only Hokage who did everything right and he also stands out in terms of personality and appearance.",

He let everyone hate Naruto and basically isolate him, which isn't his (Hiruzen) fault, cuz a person can't just erase everyone's fear and hatred from a devastating attack. Hiruzen had the Anbu also look out for Naruto and insured he never got hurt (like anyone would've noticed a little kid on Ninja Rushmore throwing paint around 5 seconds after he started, so its obvious Hiruzen and the Anbu let him do it, and kept their eyes on him). \n\nEveryone shits on Hiruzen for letting Naruto grow up in a small one room house alone and poor, with expired food. Granted that was messed up on his end, I still don't see what Hiruzen did wrong. All villages hated their Jinchuurikis. And as stated, Hiruzen can't just wipe away everyone's hatred and fear just cuz he's Hokage. And if Hiruzen didn't let Naruto face difficulties, then Naruto wouldn't have strived as hard as he did to become stronger and accepted by everyone. He also wouldn't be able to connect to the other Jinchuurikis and even villains with his talk no jutsu. His isolation is also what made him connect with Sasuke a lot.",

Naruto's world is a traditional society and leaders and protectors are loved there. There is no way police force would be hated unless everyone is a criminal like Orochimaru.\nChapter 399 makes it perfectly clear that it was Danzo who drove the Uchiha into the corner of the village.\n\nIf Tobirama had truly wanted these volatile clan hated, he would have made Curse of Hatred public knowledge. His findings were so scientific and convincing that even idealistic Hashirama couldn't dispute them.\n\nTobirama was the only Hokage who did everything right and he also stands out in terms of personality and appearance.",

Naruto's world is a traditional society and leaders and protectors are loved there. There is no way police force would be hated unless everyone is a criminal like Orochimaru.\nChapter 399 makes it perfectly clear that it was Danzo who drove the Uchiha into the corner of the village.\n\nIf Tobirama had truly wanted these volatile clan hated, he would have made Curse of Hatred public knowledge. His findings were so scientific and convincing that even idealistic Hashirama couldn't dispute them.\n\nTobirama was the only Hokage who did everything right and he also stands out in terms of personality and appearance.",

Nothing he could do could slow her down with her Strength of 100. \n\nItachi\u2019s only advantage over Pre-Timeskip Kakashi is Tsukiyomi and Susano, neither of which he can use in most scenarios unless it\u2019s an absolute emergency and in a scenario where he doesn\u2019t get the chance because Kakashi has his eyes not on Itachi\u2019s he\u2019d beat him. He\u2019s got more stamina, is faster, more experienced.\n\nItachi can\u2019t even use the Mangekyo as much as Kakashi does and he\u2019s an Uchiha. Even Naruto can break Itachi\u2019s non-Tsukiyomi genjutsu and Sasuke was able to reverse it with a base Sharingan, specifically saying it was because he\u2019d experienced it before, which means post-Tsunade mission Kakashi could do the same.",

His findings were so scientific and convincing that even idealistic Hashirama couldn't dispute them.\n\nTobirama was the only Hokage who did everything right and he also stands out in terms of personality and appearance.",
