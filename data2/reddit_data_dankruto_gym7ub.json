These are warriors, they shouldn\u2019t be getting much stronger outside their 20\u2019s/30\u2019s, they should just be refining their abilities until their bodies start to fail them in their 50\u2019s. Timeskip a generation forward and make Naruto a tired old dude that is the strongest in the village, or one of the strongest, but clearly on the downswing, and nobody has an issue. The problem is that he is still an unbelievable badass, and he should look the part.",

He should be much more adept at conserving/controlling chakra and the fact that he's shown to have unli-energy reserve through senjutsu means he SHOULD be able to sustain shadow clones for mundane daily village tasks and the low-level ninja conflict. He supplied Kurama battle-chakra to the whole freaking nation AFTER days of war and still did way more stuff up including defeating multiple God-level (Obito/Madara) and **THE** God Kaguya before his 1v1 with Sasuke. \n\nThe closest thing we could accept is probably the mental exhaustion of being a Hokage that could translate to physical symptoms but eh.",

His hair even looked a lot better in The Last, most of the designs for Boruto look super fucking weird to me, Naruto and Gaara being the worst offenders.

Add the fact that the fatigue of each shadow clone is transferred onto the original when dispelled and there is a high chakra cost associated with the multi shadow clone jutsu and its quite easy to see why he looks the way he does.",

He should be much more adept at conserving/controlling chakra and the fact that he's shown to have unli-energy reserve through senjutsu means he SHOULD be able to sustain shadow clones for mundane daily village tasks and the low-level ninja conflict. He supplied Kurama battle-chakra to the whole freaking nation AFTER days of war and still did way more stuff up including defeating multiple God-level (Obito/Madara) and **THE** God Kaguya before his 1v1 with Sasuke. \n\nThe closest thing we could accept is probably the mental exhaustion of being a Hokage that could translate to physical symptoms but eh.",

He should be much more adept at conserving/controlling chakra and the fact that he's shown to have unli-energy reserve through senjutsu means he SHOULD be able to sustain shadow clones for mundane daily village tasks and the low-level ninja conflict. He supplied Kurama battle-chakra to the whole freaking nation AFTER days of war and still did way more stuff up including defeating multiple God-level (Obito/Madara) and **THE** God Kaguya before his 1v1 with Sasuke. \n\nThe closest thing we could accept is probably the mental exhaustion of being a Hokage that could translate to physical symptoms but eh.",

He should be much more adept at conserving/controlling chakra and the fact that he's shown to have unli-energy reserve through senjutsu means he SHOULD be able to sustain shadow clones for mundane daily village tasks and the low-level ninja conflict. He supplied Kurama battle-chakra to the whole freaking nation AFTER days of war and still did way more stuff up including defeating multiple God-level (Obito/Madara) and **THE** God Kaguya before his 1v1 with Sasuke. \n\nThe closest thing we could accept is probably the mental exhaustion of being a Hokage that could translate to physical symptoms but eh.",
