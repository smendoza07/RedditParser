It was other people doing things to him that made him funny. This is why him having this breakout year is such a great story. You can't gaslight newer/unknowing fans that he's always been this beacon of comedy that shined bright every weekend. No, he was probably only ever funnier than Jihyo (w/o Gary).  \n\nAlso being one of the Easy Brothers doesn't mean he's hilarious. The entire concept of the EB's was that they were so bad that they had them come together to TRY and win something. Kinda fizzled out when Kwangsoo became such a physical and game threat but just because he was part of the Easy Brothers, didn't mean it was because he was such a dynamically hilarious member.  \n\nDon't try to upend his renaissance arc. It's a much more satisfying story than lying about whether or not he was hilarious.",

I can't do anything about your interpretation of my critique. You can feel however you want about it but I laid out the scope and details and if you are free to feel any type of way about it, that's up to you. Anything patronizing is based on how you've interpreted it. I can't feel your feelings for you.     \n\n>Ive given my opinion, and youre talking about me lying and 'gaslighting'  \n\nYour description of JSJ as he was from the start is a lie. If this is where you felt \"patronized\", then I don't know what to tell you. In a medium such as art, subjectivity is king, so **OBVIOUSLY**, your opinion is your opinion. However, on a mainstream popular television program, you can identify things that enhance the experience and performance of the cast. You can **objectively** identify that JSJ was consistently at the bottom of fan polls and was the least prominent member in terms of screen time, except maybe Jihyo post-Gary. He was reliably the least popular member by far among fans and guests alike. I do not know why you quoted gaslighting as if I either made it up or misidentified it. He was not ***always*** hilarious and to say that now when this sub's main circlejerk is how great JSJ is, is misleading and might lead newer fans in this sub to actually think he was this comedic genius from the word go. Which he was not. I'll get to why that's problematic in a second.     \n\n>Just a very weird tone to your comments of misplaced superiority, especially when you're the one downplaying his role to an extreme amount.\n\nI can't do anything about your interpretation of tone. I was pointing out that he was not always, as some seem to believe, hilarious. It isn't downplaying anything, I have pointed out several reasons why he was unfunny and unlikeable. I pointed out identifiable reasons for why I said what I said.    \n\n>really patronising  \n>  \n>misplaced superiority\n\nDoes putting genuine thought into a discussion warrant this? Does adding depth and breadth into critiques of something, that someone is passionate about, paint this image?   \n\nHere's why trying to rewrite JSJ's past is problematic.  \n\nI actually gave props to JSJ in my original reply to you. It's hard to come back from such a bad image as he previously had. He made immaculate strides in the past couple of years, especially last year, to really show people, including people like myself who grew up watching him 'Race Start' *every* episode, really what he was capable of. What he's done is almost unheard of. He's almost like the EXID or Brave Girls of variety.  \n\nMy original comment's intent was not \"JSJ is bad\". I have been a passionate fan since Running Man began. I know what people's vibes were from JSJ because I was there, in all the biggest threads, reading and absorbing what was being said at the time. His unfunny-ness and unlikable beginning make him such a great character **NOW**.  \n\nYou mentioned Easy Brothers. As I mentioned, it was originally created because LKS and JSJ literally could not get a win. JSJ was the weaker Easy Brother to boot. ***This*** is why his character revival is so perfect and why it's so important to understand where he's come from and what he overcame.  \n\nHe was literally the weakest member, on the weakest pairing, on the most popular variety show. He now has a Daesang nomination, which to a good portion of people think he should have won.  \n\nDo you know how crazy that is? If you told anybody 11 years ago that JSJ was going to be nominated for the Daesang, everybody would have thought you were crazy. Now? Now I think most people, myself included, think he's got a good shot almost every year from now on. He *barely* missed out on his Daesang, that man is going to go hard asf this year and we all benefit from not only having the pleasure of being entertained by him but also to watch him complete his arc fully.  \n\nIt truly is television history in the making and I am so happy I was able to witness it.",

It was other people doing things to him that made him funny. This is why him having this breakout year is such a great story. You can't gaslight newer/unknowing fans that he's always been this beacon of comedy that shined bright every weekend. No, he was probably only ever funnier than Jihyo (w/o Gary).  \n\nAlso being one of the Easy Brothers doesn't mean he's hilarious. The entire concept of the EB's was that they were so bad that they had them come together to TRY and win something. Kinda fizzled out when Kwangsoo became such a physical and game threat but just because he was part of the Easy Brothers, didn't mean it was because he was such a dynamically hilarious member.  \n\nDon't try to upend his renaissance arc.

I can't do anything about your interpretation of my critique. You can feel however you want about it but I laid out the scope and details and if you are free to feel any type of way about it, that's up to you. Anything patronizing is based on how you've interpreted it. I can't feel your feelings for you.     \n\n>Ive given my opinion, and youre talking about me lying and 'gaslighting'  \n\nYour description of JSJ as he was from the start is a lie. If this is where you felt \"patronized\", then I don't know what to tell you. In a medium such as art, subjectivity is king, so **OBVIOUSLY**, your opinion is your opinion. However, on a mainstream popular television program, you can identify things that enhance the experience and performance of the cast. You can **objectively** identify that JSJ was consistently at the bottom of fan polls and was the least prominent member in terms of screen time, except maybe Jihyo post-Gary. He was reliably the least popular member by far among fans and guests alike. I do not know why you quoted gaslighting as if I either made it up or misidentified it. He was not ***always*** hilarious and to say that now when this sub's main circlejerk is how great JSJ is, is misleading and might lead newer fans in this sub to actually think he was this comedic genius from the word go. Which he was not. I'll get to why that's problematic in a second.     \n\n>Just a very weird tone to your comments of misplaced superiority, especially when you're the one downplaying his role to an extreme amount.\n\nI can't do anything about your interpretation of tone. I was pointing out that he was not always, as some seem to believe, hilarious. It isn't downplaying anything, I have pointed out several reasons why he was unfunny and unlikeable. I pointed out identifiable reasons for why I said what I said.    \n\n>really patronising  \n>  \n>misplaced superiority\n\nDoes putting genuine thought into a discussion warrant this? Does adding depth and breadth into critiques of something, that someone is passionate about, paint this image?   \n\nHere's why trying to rewrite JSJ's past is problematic.  \n\nI actually gave props to JSJ in my original reply to you. It's hard to come back from such a bad image as he previously had. He made immaculate strides in the past couple of years, especially last year, to really show people, including people like myself who grew up watching him 'Race Start' *every* episode, really what he was capable of. What he's done is almost unheard of. He's almost like the EXID or Brave Girls of variety.  \n\nMy original comment's intent was not \"JSJ is bad\". I have been a passionate fan since Running Man began. I know what people's vibes were from JSJ because I was there, in all the biggest threads, reading and absorbing what was being said at the time. His unfunny-ness and unlikable beginning make him such a great character **NOW**.  \n\nYou mentioned Easy Brothers. As I mentioned, it was originally created because LKS and JSJ literally could not get a win. JSJ was the weaker Easy Brother to boot. ***This*** is why his character revival is so perfect and why it's so important to understand where he's come from and what he overcame.  \n\nHe was literally the weakest member, on the weakest pairing, on the most popular variety show. He now has a Daesang nomination, which to a good portion of people think he should have won.  \n\nDo you know how crazy that is? If you told anybody 11 years ago that JSJ was going to be nominated for the Daesang, everybody would have thought you were crazy. Now? Now I think most people, myself included, think he's got a good shot almost every year from now on. He *barely* missed out on his Daesang, that man is going to go hard asf this year and we all benefit from not only having the pleasure of being entertained by him but also to watch him complete his arc fully.  \n\nIt truly is television history in the making and I am so happy I was able to witness it.",

Like ever.   \n\nLooking at him now, then going back to rewatch isn't the same as watching him live every Sunday for 12 years. He was never the person to make everybody laugh. It was other people doing things to him that made him funny. This is why him having this breakout year is such a great story. You can't gaslight newer/unknowing fans that he's always been this beacon of comedy that shined bright every weekend. No, he was probably only ever funnier than Jihyo (w/o Gary).  \n\nAlso being one of the Easy Brothers doesn't mean he's hilarious. The entire concept of the EB's was that they were so bad that they had them come together to TRY and win something. Kinda fizzled out when Kwangsoo became such a physical and game threat but just because he was part of the Easy Brothers, didn't mean it was because he was such a dynamically hilarious member.  \n\nDon't try to upend his renaissance arc.

I can't do anything about your interpretation of my critique. You can feel however you want about it but I laid out the scope and details and if you are free to feel any type of way about it, that's up to you. Anything patronizing is based on how you've interpreted it. I can't feel your feelings for you.     \n\n>Ive given my opinion, and youre talking about me lying and 'gaslighting'  \n\nYour description of JSJ as he was from the start is a lie. If this is where you felt \"patronized\", then I don't know what to tell you. In a medium such as art, subjectivity is king, so **OBVIOUSLY**, your opinion is your opinion. However, on a mainstream popular television program, you can identify things that enhance the experience and performance of the cast. You can **objectively** identify that JSJ was consistently at the bottom of fan polls and was the least prominent member in terms of screen time, except maybe Jihyo post-Gary. He was reliably the least popular member by far among fans and guests alike. I do not know why you quoted gaslighting as if I either made it up or misidentified it. He was not ***always*** hilarious and to say that now when this sub's main circlejerk is how great JSJ is, is misleading and might lead newer fans in this sub to actually think he was this comedic genius from the word go. Which he was not. I'll get to why that's problematic in a second.     \n\n>Just a very weird tone to your comments of misplaced superiority, especially when you're the one downplaying his role to an extreme amount.\n\nI can't do anything about your interpretation of tone. I was pointing out that he was not always, as some seem to believe, hilarious. It isn't downplaying anything, I have pointed out several reasons why he was unfunny and unlikeable. I pointed out identifiable reasons for why I said what I said.    \n\n>really patronising  \n>  \n>misplaced superiority\n\nDoes putting genuine thought into a discussion warrant this? Does adding depth and breadth into critiques of something, that someone is passionate about, paint this image?   \n\nHere's why trying to rewrite JSJ's past is problematic.  \n\nI actually gave props to JSJ in my original reply to you. It's hard to come back from such a bad image as he previously had. He made immaculate strides in the past couple of years, especially last year, to really show people, including people like myself who grew up watching him 'Race Start' *every* episode, really what he was capable of. What he's done is almost unheard of. He's almost like the EXID or Brave Girls of variety.  \n\nMy original comment's intent was not \"JSJ is bad\". I have been a passionate fan since Running Man began. I know what people's vibes were from JSJ because I was there, in all the biggest threads, reading and absorbing what was being said at the time. His unfunny-ness and unlikable beginning make him such a great character **NOW**.  \n\nYou mentioned Easy Brothers. As I mentioned, it was originally created because LKS and JSJ literally could not get a win. JSJ was the weaker Easy Brother to boot. ***This*** is why his character revival is so perfect and why it's so important to understand where he's come from and what he overcame.  \n\nHe was literally the weakest member, on the weakest pairing, on the most popular variety show. He now has a Daesang nomination, which to a good portion of people think he should have won.  \n\nDo you know how crazy that is? If you told anybody 11 years ago that JSJ was going to be nominated for the Daesang, everybody would have thought you were crazy. Now? Now I think most people, myself included, think he's got a good shot almost every year from now on. He *barely* missed out on his Daesang, that man is going to go hard asf this year and we all benefit from not only having the pleasure of being entertained by him but also to watch him complete his arc fully.  \n\nIt truly is television history in the making and I am so happy I was able to witness it.",

            "body": ">Its funny when we're talking about unlikeability, when your comments make you so honestly, really patronising\n\nThe topic is not about my unlikability.  I can't do anything about your interpretation of my critique. You can feel however you want about it but I laid out the scope and details and if you are free to feel any type of way about it, that's up to you. Anything patronizing is based on how you've interpreted it. I can't feel your feelings for you.     \n\n>Ive given my opinion, and youre talking about me lying and 'gaslighting'  \n\nYour description of JSJ as he was from the start is a lie. If this is where you felt \"patronized\", then I don't know what to tell you. In a medium such as art, subjectivity is king, so **OBVIOUSLY**, your opinion is your opinion. However, on a mainstream popular television program, you can identify things that enhance the experience and performance of the cast. You can **objectively** identify that JSJ was consistently at the bottom of fan polls and was the least prominent member in terms of screen time, except maybe Jihyo post-Gary. He was reliably the least popular member by far among fans and guests alike. I do not know why you quoted gaslighting as if I either made it up or misidentified it. He was not ***always*** hilarious and to say that now when this sub's main circlejerk is how great JSJ is, is misleading and might lead newer fans in this sub to actually think he was this comedic genius from the word go. Which he was not. I'll get to why that's problematic in a second.     \n\n>Just a very weird tone to your comments of misplaced superiority, especially when you're the one downplaying his role to an extreme amount.\n\nI can't do anything about your interpretation of tone. I was pointing out that he was not always, as some seem to believe, hilarious. It isn't downplaying anything, I have pointed out several reasons why he was unfunny and unlikeable. I pointed out identifiable reasons for why I said what I said.    \n\n>really patronising  \n>  \n>misplaced superiority\n\nDoes putting genuine thought into a discussion warrant this? Does adding depth and breadth into critiques of something, that someone is passionate about, paint this image?   \n\nHere's why trying to rewrite JSJ's past is problematic.  \n\nI actually gave props to JSJ in my original reply to you. It's hard to come back from such a bad image as he previously had. He made immaculate strides in the past couple of years, especially last year, to really show people, including people like myself who grew up watching him 'Race Start' *every* episode, really what he was capable of. What he's done is almost unheard of. He's almost like the EXID or Brave Girls of variety.  \n\nMy original comment's intent was not \"JSJ is bad\". I have been a passionate fan since Running Man began. I know what people's vibes were from JSJ because I was there, in all the biggest threads, reading and absorbing what was being said at the time. His unfunny-ness and unlikable beginning make him such a great character **NOW**.  \n\nYou mentioned Easy Brothers. As I mentioned, it was originally created because LKS and JSJ literally could not get a win. JSJ was the weaker Easy Brother to boot. ***This*** is why his character revival is so perfect and why it's so important to understand where he's come from and what he overcame.  \n\nHe was literally the weakest member, on the weakest pairing, on the most popular variety show. He now has a Daesang nomination, which to a good portion of people think he should have won.  \n\nDo you know how crazy that is? If you told anybody 11 years ago that JSJ was going to be nominated for the Daesang, everybody would have thought you were crazy. Now? Now I think most people, myself included, think he's got a good shot almost every year from now on. He *barely* missed out on his Daesang, that man is going to go hard asf this year and we all benefit from not only having the pleasure of being entertained by him but also to watch him complete his arc fully.  \n\nIt truly is television history in the making and I am so happy I was able to witness it.",
