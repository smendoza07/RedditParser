The idea here is to reveal the shape of your skull under your hair. Make sure your hair line is clearly visible.\n\n2. Take a mirror pic or have a friend take a picture. Selfie works okay but might be too close to give you a really clear idea of what the buzz cut will look like.\n\n3. In photoshop, use the stamp tool or brush tool with the color of the background to \u201ctrim\u201d your hair as close to your cranium as possible. Try feeling your head and looking at pictures of bald heads to make the shape as accurate as possible.\n\n4. Squint to get a vague idea of what it might look like.\n\n5. For advanced buzz cutters: Use a textured brush or sample some buzz cut hair texture from another picture (Luckily I have a beard so I just sampled my own beard texture) and paint it over your hair. Fade the edges of your hair line with a skin-colored brush on low opacity. Lighten the color of your hair with the same brush. This should give you the final result you see in my picture, which was much more accurate than I expected.\n\n6. Take the plunge! I\u2019m super happy and it feels so good and free",

Then I started letting it get longer and longer. Went through an awkward phase for sure, which is why I was so hesitant about the buzz cut \u2014 an awkward road ahead if I want to grow it out again. But my hair seems to grow abnormally fast, took less than a year to reach the length in the first pic. \n\nOnly advice I have is start taking really good care of it now. My hair seems pretty tough but I should\u2019ve conditioned more I think. Also find a good barber and tell them you\u2019re growing it out and they\u2019ll know how to help you. That\u2019s what I always did and they seemed to know how to cut it",

The idea here is to reveal the shape of your skull under your hair. Make sure your hair line is clearly visible.\n\n2. Take a mirror pic or have a friend take a picture. Selfie works okay but might be too close to give you a really clear idea of what the buzz cut will look like.\n\n3. In photoshop, use the stamp tool or brush tool with the color of the background to \u201ctrim\u201d your hair as close to your cranium as possible. Try feeling your head and looking at pictures of bald heads to make the shape as accurate as possible.\n\n4. Squint to get a vague idea of what it might look like.\n\n5. For advanced buzz cutters: Use a textured brush or sample some buzz cut hair texture from another picture (Luckily I have a beard so I just sampled my own beard texture) and paint it over your hair. Fade the edges of your hair line with a skin-colored brush on low opacity. Lighten the color of your hair with the same brush. This should give you the final result you see in my picture, which was much more accurate than I expected.\n\n6. Take the plunge! I\u2019m super happy and it feels so good and free",

Hats feel a bit weird, the friction of my prickly hair stubs against the cloth is strange",

Then I started letting it get longer and longer. Went through an awkward phase for sure, which is why I was so hesitant about the buzz cut \u2014 an awkward road ahead if I want to grow it out again. But my hair seems to grow abnormally fast, took less than a year to reach the length in the first pic. \n\nOnly advice I have is start taking really good care of it now. My hair seems pretty tough but I should\u2019ve conditioned more I think. Also find a good barber and tell them you\u2019re growing it out and they\u2019ll know how to help you. That\u2019s what I always did and they seemed to know how to cut it",
