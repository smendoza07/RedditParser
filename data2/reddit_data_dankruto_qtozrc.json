His bet with Tsunade was to master it within a week, but at that point he had already started learning the third stage. It's hard to say exactly how long he had spent learning the first two stages, but we know each one at least took multiple days. So I'd say it took him at least two weeks in total, but it could have been as long as a month.",

                    "body": "I'm just gonna paste my comment from above, but it is 100% believable IMO. \n\n\"This comment section is really weird. So many of you want to just label it 'kishimoto bad! Naruto no learn new jutsu!' When there are levels. \n\nNaruto didn't learn rasengan in a week, and he sure as hell didn't master it in that time. It took him several days to complete each of the first 2 steps, then he was able to get the 3rd step down right before the big fight between the 3 sannin. Even when he used it against kabuto in that fight it wasn't perfect, as kabuto is able to get back up afterward. \n\nIt was also said multiple times Naruto lacked mastery of the fundamentals, and Jiraiya's real goal during the 3 year skip was to help Naruto control the 9 tails Chakra. We don't know how long he worked on that specifically, but in a flashback Naruto says that training made the rasengan training look like a piece of cake (don't remember the exact line). \n\nOntop of these things, it was also mentioned in a flashback that Naruto trained to release Genjutsu during that time as well.\n\nSo with all of this, I think its pretty reasonable to assume that Naruto went through alot of growth during the time skip. We can reasonably assume he learned:\n\nMastery over fundamentals:\n   - Chakra control\n   - Taijutsu\n   - The few ninjutsu he does have.\n\nMastery of Rasengan\n   - Giant Rasengan\n\nGenjutsu release\n\nNine tails Chakra control\n  - (Like i mentioned before he trained for some amount of time on this, but did not end up mastering as we all know)\n\nAs well, Jiraiya wasn't exactly a model teacher. He constantly wasted time abusing the 3 ninja prohibitions, and I would venture to say this slowed down the progress Naruto was able to make, but did teach him lessons about the 3 prohibitions.\n\nAnd to top it off, the main comparison we can draw against Naruto is Sasuke, who made inhuman progress during the 3 years because, well, Uchiha. I think we are supposed to see that Sasuke has moved much faster than Naruto.\n\nIDK. Just seems like alot of Kishi hate when if you just think about it, it's not that unbelievable.\"",

Of course it is, thats why I listed it in the first place? He learned the things I listed in 3 years. \n\n2nd, it was his first time trying to release genjutsu after learning it. And he did it against itachi. It didn't work because itachis visual prowess was on another level. U can mock 3 tomoi sharingan. But Danzo was able to use his (as a non-uchiha) to put genjutsu on mifune. And itachi had one of the strongest visual prowess among any of the Uchiha, 2nd and 3rd only to Madara and Obito.

Naruto was literally always an underdog in the first series. He was by far not the best ninja, flunked academy a few times. Wasn't super skilled in ninjutsu, and didn't have a knack for picking things up quickly. Naruto was not the brightest Bulb either. \n\n>And it doesn't even look like he trained for 9 tails power at all , While having no cloak he was already losing control against deidara .\n\nTraining to control the nine tails was excruciatingly difficult. And after the incident with him almost killing Jiraiya, they tightened Naruto seal again and did not continue to work on it. It was a failure, hence why I SAID it was a failure in my comment. Just because they failed to learn it doesn't mean they didn't spend time on it.\n\n>And also itachi was the only akatsuki member the leaf and jiraiya knew , you would expect jiraiya to teach him sage mode to counter vissual genjutsu\n\nTeaching sage mode to a kid when he had never even fully mastered it himself? You're putting writers and jiraiya up on a pedestal. He was an extraordinary ninja, but was far from perfect.",

Izanami and even izanagi to an extent are kinda just plot convenience I agree. \n\nThe other powerful abilities you named like Kamui and Kotoamatsukami belong to different powerful individuals, so it makes sense they are as strong as they are. Kamui is so broken because Obito is literally one of the main villains in the series. Literally only two characters had ems, a main character and a main villain.\n\nIf you think about it for once you'll realise that the reason the sharingan as a whole seems so powerful is because there are multiple Uchiha that are central characters to the plot. Naturally they're gonna have strong abilities. Saying the author of the series is \"d riding\" characters is so incredibly immature.",

During the massacre, only three members of the clan had mangekyou (two excluding anime filler). That's what didn't make sense, since so many Uchiha would've faced losses during the wars. But that didn't make them OP since almost no one unlocked ms.\n\nLike I said, many central protagonists and antagonists are Uchiha, so it's natural those characters in particular get powerups based on their kekkei genkai. There are no main villains from the hyuga or yamanaka clan or something, so they don't seem as OP. (I would've liked those clans to have more of a role, but as things stand it makes sense).\n\nHow is ems a win button? You can use ms abilities without going blind, but it isn't instakill against strong enough opponents.",

Naruto's equivalent of taijutsu pre training was throw shadow clones at them to flail around until he can get in a good hit. After training he actually became pretty proficient in taijutsu so each clone was able to be used more effectively. He would never have been able to master frog kumite with sage mode if he didn't learn more taijutsu from Jiraya. He also learned more about chakra control so that he could tap into his massive Uzumaki chakra reserves more effectively. There's more to learning to be a good ninja than just learning jutsu.\n\nThat said Jiraya wasted way too much time and should've taught him more. He could've at least taught him about chakra natures which Kakashi had to cover in the wind style rasenshuriken training.",

It would\u2019ve been extremely redundant and boring to educate the audience on chakra natures if naruto had already spent three years learning about it off screen, and it would\u2019ve been difficult for him to learn or develop any new justus over that time without some understanding of chakra natures. Kishi had to pick and choose things the audience already knew about for naruto to improve on during the timeskip.",

Downside is that Jiraiya nearly got killed and was injured for a while. When they got back to training he went a full 180 on the curriculum and had to be careful not to pressure Naruto to hard to prevent him going out of control. So that's his excuse.\n\nThe second one is the most important overall though, no really. Arguably, it's tied to his new Talk-No-Jutsu variant that he used on Nagato.",

Naruto should've been taught two to three chakra natures water and wind and maybe earth, water to say fuck you to the Uchiha's fire jutsu, wind because it's his base, earth because of Kisame water and air bullets seem like good obvious choices due to their modular nature where the more chakra you load into the jutsu the stronger it is so copying it is a stupid move.\n\nFor water style A water stream jutsu like that rampaging water jutsu from storm one that Gamabunta uses or that he taught Yahiko. Great waterfall because chakra, and the hidden mist jutsu because it messes with Sharingan(they should've kept that) and had Jiraiya teach him some sensory ninjutsu involving tracking chakra.\n\nFor wind style Jutsu air bullets and other mid-long range jutsu would round him out and fix his early lack of long range offensive capabilities and simply enhancing all of his kunai or shuriken with wind chakra would push him a step beyond. \n\nFor earth style maybe mudwall or another stronger defensive earth style  \n\nShuriken shadow clones while not an elemental jutsu seems like an obvious choice to teach Naruto. and with other non-elemental jutsu flying raijin but Naruto doesn't use it much\n\nI also think Kekkei Genkai jutsu shouldn't be limited to only a clan it should just be extremely hard to learn unless you're born with all of the natures in the style leading Naruto to figure out ice release, and wood style just doesn't have many users due to typically water and earth mixes making mud style(also having Tsunade and Nawaki being users but because Nawaki used it more Tsunade just doesn't use it to remember him)\n\nNerf short range Kamui, make certain types of jutsu still affect it",

I think Jiraya knew the potential naruto had with kurama so I think they focused mostly on controlling that and his own emotions better so he would one day be able to unlock its full power, thanks what I think anyway, It'd have been cool if he learned a few new useful jutsu over that time but I think they were just preparing for the shippuden era",

            "body": "This comment section is really weird. So many of you want to just label it \"kishimoto bad! Naruto no learn new jutsu!\" When there are levels. \n\nNaruto didn't learn rasengan in a week, and he sure as hell didn't master it in that time. It took him several days to complete each of the first 2 steps, then he was able to get the 3rd step down right before the big fight between the 3 sannin. Even when he used it against kabuto in that fight it wasn't perfect, as kabuto is able to get back up afterward. \n\nIt was also said multiple times Naruto lacked mastery of the fundamentals, and Jiraiya's real goal during the 3 year skip was to help Naruto control the 9 tails Chakra. We don't know how long he worked on that specifically, but in a flashback Naruto says that training made the rasengan training look like a piece of cake (don't remember the exact line). \n\nOntop of these things, it was also mentioned in a flashback that Naruto trained to release Genjutsu during that time as well.\n\nSo with all of this, I think its pretty reasonable to assume that Naruto went through alot of growth during the time skip. We can reasonably assume he learned:\n\nMastery over fundamentals:\n   - Chakra control\n   - Taijutsu\n   - The few ninjutsu he does have.\n\nMastery of Rasengan\n   - Giant Rasengan\n\nGenjutsu release\n\nNine tails Chakra control\n  - (Like i mentioned before he trained for some amount of time on this, but did not end up mastering as we all know)\n\nAs well, Jiraiya wasn't exactly a model teacher. He constantly wasted time abusing the 3 ninja prohibitions, and I would venture to say this slowed down the progress Naruto was able to make, but did teach him lessons about the 3 prohibitions.\n\nAnd to top it off, the main comparison we can draw against Naruto is Sasuke, who made inhuman progress during the 3 years because, well, Uchiha. I think we are supposed to see that Sasuke has moved much faster than Naruto.\n\nIDK. Just seems like alot of Kishi hate when if you just think about it, it's not that unbelievable.",

There is a clear improvement in his improvisation and level headedness after the gap (obviously partly due to him actually growing up).\n\nAnd also breaking down his way of fighting and forcing him to re-learn a better use of taijutsu and chakra control. Because of the massive chakra reserve Naruto has, I do agree it would make more sense to focus on improving the power behind his Rasengan over trying to get a one handed version down. I'd imagine he can use the clone to pump more power into anyways and that's why the Giant Rasengan seemed like the only thing he learned.\n\nIt also stands to reason that Jiraiya wasn't sure how to improve the Rasengan at that point, whereas Kakashi had already tried it and had a previous experience to try it out and thus came up with the clone training idea.\n\nI do like thinking that a lot of the time away was spent travelling and researching for Jiraiyas book. And the remainder was spent trying to force control over the Nine Tails' power (which would fit into the scene where he gets attacked by the nine tails mode Naruto). After which, to prevent it from happening again I think it makes sense to approach an improvement in power of an existing jutsu instead of pushing that seal again trying to come up with fancy new jutsu all at once in a time where Naruto was very emotionally unstable and immature.\n\nI could very well be talking out my ass so please correct any mistakes I've made!

Naruto no learn new jutsu!' When there are levels. \n\nNaruto didn't learn rasengan in a week, and he sure as hell didn't master it in that time. It took him several days to complete each of the first 2 steps, then he was able to get the 3rd step down right before the big fight between the 3 sannin. Even when he used it against kabuto in that fight it wasn't perfect, as kabuto is able to get back up afterward. \n\nIt was also said multiple times Naruto lacked mastery of the fundamentals, and Jiraiya's real goal during the 3 year skip was to help Naruto control the 9 tails Chakra. We don't know how long he worked on that specifically, but in a flashback Naruto says that training made the rasengan training look like a piece of cake (don't remember the exact line). \n\nOntop of these things, it was also mentioned in a flashback that Naruto trained to release Genjutsu during that time as well.\n\nSo with all of this, I think its pretty reasonable to assume that Naruto went through alot of growth during the time skip. We can reasonably assume he learned:\n\nMastery over fundamentals:\n   - Chakra control\n   - Taijutsu\n   - The few ninjutsu he does have.\n\nMastery of Rasengan\n   - Giant Rasengan\n\nGenjutsu release\n\nNine tails Chakra control\n  - (Like i mentioned before he trained for some amount of time on this, but did not end up mastering as we all know)\n\nAs well, Jiraiya wasn't exactly a model teacher. He constantly wasted time abusing the 3 ninja prohibitions, and I would venture to say this slowed down the progress Naruto was able to make, but did teach him lessons about the 3 prohibitions.\n\nAnd to top it off, the main comparison we can draw against Naruto is Sasuke, who made inhuman progress during the 3 years because, well, Uchiha. I think we are supposed to see that Sasuke has moved much faster than Naruto.\n\nIDK. Just seems like alot of Kishi hate when if you just think about it, it's not that unbelievable.\"",

Of course it is, thats why I listed it in the first place? He learned the things I listed in 3 years. \n\n2nd, it was his first time trying to release genjutsu after learning it. And he did it against itachi. It didn't work because itachis visual prowess was on another level. U can mock 3 tomoi sharingan. But Danzo was able to use his (as a non-uchiha) to put genjutsu on mifune. And itachi had one of the strongest visual prowess among any of the Uchiha, 2nd and 3rd only to Madara and Obito.

Izanami and even izanagi to an extent are kinda just plot convenience I agree. \n\nThe other powerful abilities you named like Kamui and Kotoamatsukami belong to different powerful individuals, so it makes sense they are as strong as they are. Kamui is so broken because Obito is literally one of the main villains in the series. Literally only two characters had ems, a main character and a main villain.\n\nIf you think about it for once you'll realise that the reason the sharingan as a whole seems so powerful is because there are multiple Uchiha that are central characters to the plot. Naturally they're gonna have strong abilities. Saying the author of the series is \"d riding\" characters is so incredibly immature.",

But that didn't make them OP since almost no one unlocked ms.\n\nLike I said, many central protagonists and antagonists are Uchiha, so it's natural those characters in particular get powerups based on their kekkei genkai. There are no main villains from the hyuga or yamanaka clan or something, so they don't seem as OP.

Naruto's equivalent of taijutsu pre training was throw shadow clones at them to flail around until he can get in a good hit. After training he actually became pretty proficient in taijutsu so each clone was able to be used more effectively. He would never have been able to master frog kumite with sage mode if he didn't learn more taijutsu from Jiraya. He also learned more about chakra control so that he could tap into his massive Uzumaki chakra reserves more effectively. There's more to learning to be a good ninja than just learning jutsu.\n\nThat said Jiraya wasted way too much time and should've taught him more. He could've at least taught him about chakra natures which Kakashi had to cover in the wind style rasenshuriken training.",

Great waterfall because chakra, and the hidden mist jutsu because it messes with Sharingan(they should've kept that) and had Jiraiya teach him some sensory ninjutsu involving tracking chakra.\n\nFor wind style Jutsu air bullets and other mid-long range jutsu would round him out and fix his early lack of long range offensive capabilities and simply enhancing all of his kunai or shuriken with wind chakra would push him a step beyond. \n\nFor earth style maybe mudwall or another stronger defensive earth style  \n\nShuriken shadow clones while not an elemental jutsu seems like an obvious choice to teach Naruto. and with other non-elemental jutsu flying raijin but Naruto doesn't use it much\n\nI also think Kekkei Genkai jutsu shouldn't be limited to only a clan it should just be extremely hard to learn unless you're born with all of the natures in the style leading Naruto to figure out ice release, and wood style just doesn't have many users due to typically water and earth mixes making mud style(also having Tsunade and Nawaki being users but because Nawaki used it more Tsunade just doesn't use it to remember him)\n\nNerf short range Kamui, make certain types of jutsu still affect it",

Of course it is, thats why I listed it in the first place? He learned the things I listed in 3 years. \n\n2nd, it was his first time trying to release genjutsu after learning it. And he did it against itachi. It didn't work because itachis visual prowess was on another level. U can mock 3 tomoi sharingan. But Danzo was able to use his (as a non-uchiha) to put genjutsu on mifune. And itachi had one of the strongest visual prowess among any of the Uchiha, 2nd and 3rd only to Madara and Obito.

Izanami and even izanagi to an extent are kinda just plot convenience I agree. \n\nThe other powerful abilities you named like Kamui and Kotoamatsukami belong to different powerful individuals, so it makes sense they are as strong as they are. Kamui is so broken because Obito is literally one of the main villains in the series. Literally only two characters had ems, a main character and a main villain.\n\nIf you think about it for once you'll realise that the reason the sharingan as a whole seems so powerful is because there are multiple Uchiha that are central characters to the plot. Naturally they're gonna have strong abilities. Saying the author of the series is \"d riding\" characters is so incredibly immature.",

During the massacre, only three members of the clan had mangekyou (two excluding anime filler). That's what didn't make sense, since so many Uchiha would've faced losses during the wars. But that didn't make them OP since almost no one unlocked ms.\n\nLike I said, many central protagonists and antagonists are Uchiha, so it's natural those characters in particular get powerups based on their kekkei genkai. There are no main villains from the hyuga or yamanaka clan or something, so they don't seem as OP. (I would've liked those clans to have more of a role, but as things stand it makes sense).\n\nHow is ems a win button? You can use ms abilities without going blind, but it isn't instakill against strong enough opponents.",

Naruto's equivalent of taijutsu pre training was throw shadow clones at them to flail around until he can get in a good hit. After training he actually became pretty proficient in taijutsu so each clone was able to be used more effectively. He would never have been able to master frog kumite with sage mode if he didn't learn more taijutsu from Jiraya. He also learned more about chakra control so that he could tap into his massive Uzumaki chakra reserves more effectively. There's more to learning to be a good ninja than just learning jutsu.\n\nThat said Jiraya wasted way too much time and should've taught him more. He could've at least taught him about chakra natures which Kakashi had to cover in the wind style rasenshuriken training.",

Naruto was literally always an underdog in the first series. He was by far not the best ninja, flunked academy a few times. Wasn't super skilled in ninjutsu, and didn't have a knack for picking things up quickly. Naruto was not the brightest Bulb either. \n\n>And it doesn't even look like he trained for 9 tails power at all , While having no cloak he was already losing control against deidara .\n\nTraining to control the nine tails was excruciatingly difficult. And after the incident with him almost killing Jiraiya, they tightened Naruto seal again and did not continue to work on it. It was a failure, hence why I SAID it was a failure in my comment. Just because they failed to learn it doesn't mean they didn't spend time on it.\n\n>And also itachi was the only akatsuki member the leaf and jiraiya knew , you would expect jiraiya to teach him sage mode to counter vissual genjutsu\n\nTeaching sage mode to a kid when he had never even fully mastered it himself? You're putting writers and jiraiya up on a pedestal. He was an extraordinary ninja, but was far from perfect.",

Amazing.\n\n\"MS itself is bs\". Doesn't their true power lie in  their abilities? So it in itself being \"bs\" doesn't make sense. Izanami and even izanagi to an extent are kinda just plot convenience I agree. \n\nThe other powerful abilities you named like Kamui and Kotoamatsukami belong to different powerful individuals, so it makes sense they are as strong as they are. Kamui is so broken because Obito is literally one of the main villains in the series. Literally only two characters had ems, a main character and a main villain.\n\nIf you think about it for once you'll realise that the reason the sharingan as a whole seems so powerful is because there are multiple Uchiha that are central characters to the plot. Naturally they're gonna have strong abilities. Saying the author of the series is \"d riding\" characters is so incredibly immature.",

During the massacre, only three members of the clan had mangekyou (two excluding anime filler). That's what didn't make sense, since so many Uchiha would've faced losses during the wars. But that didn't make them OP since almost no one unlocked ms.\n\nLike I said, many central protagonists and antagonists are Uchiha, so it's natural those characters in particular get powerups based on their kekkei genkai. There are no main villains from the hyuga or yamanaka clan or something, so they don't seem as OP. (I would've liked those clans to have more of a role, but as things stand it makes sense).\n\nHow is ems a win button?

Naruto did learn rasenshuriken (an unprecedented feat),sage mode, and then KCM was just next level badass. He doesn't just ignore Naruto,except for arguable as this post says the time skip,which does seem underwhelming in retrospect. Having powerful mangekyou abilities in the series isn't \"d riding uchihas\" lol.",

Doesn't their true power lie in  their abilities? So it in itself being \"bs\" doesn't make sense. Izanami and even izanagi to an extent are kinda just plot convenience I agree. \n\nThe other powerful abilities you named like Kamui and Kotoamatsukami belong to different powerful individuals, so it makes sense they are as strong as they are. Kamui is so broken because Obito is literally one of the main villains in the series. Literally only two characters had ems, a main character and a main villain.\n\nIf you think about it for once you'll realise that the reason the sharingan as a whole seems so powerful is because there are multiple Uchiha that are central characters to the plot. Naturally they're gonna have strong abilities. Saying the author of the series is \"d riding\" characters is so incredibly immature.",

But that didn't make them OP since almost no one unlocked ms.\n\nLike I said, many central protagonists and antagonists are Uchiha, so it's natural those characters in particular get powerups based on their kekkei genkai. There are no main villains from the hyuga or yamanaka clan or something, so they don't seem as OP.

Kamui is so broken because Obito is literally one of the main villains in the series. Literally only two characters had ems, a main character and a main villain.\n\nIf you think about it for once you'll realise that the reason the sharingan as a whole seems so powerful is because there are multiple Uchiha that are central characters to the plot.

Doesn't their true power lie in  their abilities? So it in itself being \"bs\" doesn't make sense. Izanami and even izanagi to an extent are kinda just plot convenience I agree. \n\nThe other powerful abilities you named like Kamui and Kotoamatsukami belong to different powerful individuals, so it makes sense they are as strong as they are. Kamui is so broken because Obito is literally one of the main villains in the series. Literally only two characters had ems, a main character and a main villain.\n\nIf you think about it for once you'll realise that the reason the sharingan as a whole seems so powerful is because there are multiple Uchiha that are central characters to the plot. Naturally they're gonna have strong abilities. Saying the author of the series is \"d riding\" characters is so incredibly immature.",

But that didn't make them OP since almost no one unlocked ms.\n\nLike I said, many central protagonists and antagonists are Uchiha, so it's natural those characters in particular get powerups based on their kekkei genkai. There are no main villains from the hyuga or yamanaka clan or something, so they don't seem as OP.

Doesn't their true power lie in  their abilities? So it in itself being \"bs\" doesn't make sense. Izanami and even izanagi to an extent are kinda just plot convenience I agree. \n\nThe other powerful abilities you named like Kamui and Kotoamatsukami belong to different powerful individuals, so it makes sense they are as strong as they are. Kamui is so broken because Obito is literally one of the main villains in the series. Literally only two characters had ems, a main character and a main villain.\n\nIf you think about it for once you'll realise that the reason the sharingan as a whole seems so powerful is because there are multiple Uchiha that are central characters to the plot. Naturally they're gonna have strong abilities. Saying the author of the series is \"d riding\" characters is so incredibly immature.",

During the massacre, only three members of the clan had mangekyou (two excluding anime filler). That's what didn't make sense, since so many Uchiha would've faced losses during the wars. But that didn't make them OP since almost no one unlocked ms.\n\nLike I said, many central protagonists and antagonists are Uchiha, so it's natural those characters in particular get powerups based on their kekkei genkai. There are no main villains from the hyuga or yamanaka clan or something, so they don't seem as OP. (I would've liked those clans to have more of a role, but as things stand it makes sense).\n\nHow is ems a win button?

Kamui is so broken because Obito is literally one of the main villains in the series. Literally only two characters had ems, a main character and a main villain.\n\nIf you think about it for once you'll realise that the reason the sharingan as a whole seems so powerful is because there are multiple Uchiha that are central characters to the plot.

But that didn't make them OP since almost no one unlocked ms.\n\nLike I said, many central protagonists and antagonists are Uchiha, so it's natural those characters in particular get powerups based on their kekkei genkai. There are no main villains from the hyuga or yamanaka clan or something, so they don't seem as OP.

Doesn't their true power lie in  their abilities? So it in itself being \"bs\" doesn't make sense. Izanami and even izanagi to an extent are kinda just plot convenience I agree. \n\nThe other powerful abilities you named like Kamui and Kotoamatsukami belong to different powerful individuals, so it makes sense they are as strong as they are. Kamui is so broken because Obito is literally one of the main villains in the series. Literally only two characters had ems, a main character and a main villain.\n\nIf you think about it for once you'll realise that the reason the sharingan as a whole seems so powerful is because there are multiple Uchiha that are central characters to the plot. Naturally they're gonna have strong abilities. Saying the author of the series is \"d riding\" characters is so incredibly immature.",

During the massacre, only three members of the clan had mangekyou (two excluding anime filler). That's what didn't make sense, since so many Uchiha would've faced losses during the wars. But that didn't make them OP since almost no one unlocked ms.\n\nLike I said, many central protagonists and antagonists are Uchiha, so it's natural those characters in particular get powerups based on their kekkei genkai. There are no main villains from the hyuga or yamanaka clan or something, so they don't seem as OP. (I would've liked those clans to have more of a role, but as things stand it makes sense).\n\nHow is ems a win button?

So it in itself being \"bs\" doesn't make sense. Izanami and even izanagi to an extent are kinda just plot convenience I agree. \n\nThe other powerful abilities you named like Kamui and Kotoamatsukami belong to different powerful individuals, so it makes sense they are as strong as they are. Kamui is so broken because Obito is literally one of the main villains in the series. Literally only two characters had ems, a main character and a main villain.\n\nIf you think about it for once you'll realise that the reason the sharingan as a whole seems so powerful is because there are multiple Uchiha that are central characters to the plot. Naturally they're gonna have strong abilities. Saying the author of the series is \"d riding\" characters is so incredibly immature.",

During the massacre, only three members of the clan had mangekyou (two excluding anime filler). That's what didn't make sense, since so many Uchiha would've faced losses during the wars. But that didn't make them OP since almost no one unlocked ms.\n\nLike I said, many central protagonists and antagonists are Uchiha, so it's natural those characters in particular get powerups based on their kekkei genkai. There are no main villains from the hyuga or yamanaka clan or something, so they don't seem as OP. (I would've liked those clans to have more of a role, but as things stand it makes sense).\n\nHow is ems a win button?

So it in itself being \"bs\" doesn't make sense. Izanami and even izanagi to an extent are kinda just plot convenience I agree. \n\nThe other powerful abilities you named like Kamui and Kotoamatsukami belong to different powerful individuals, so it makes sense they are as strong as they are. Kamui is so broken because Obito is literally one of the main villains in the series. Literally only two characters had ems, a main character and a main villain.\n\nIf you think about it for once you'll realise that the reason the sharingan as a whole seems so powerful is because there are multiple Uchiha that are central characters to the plot. Naturally they're gonna have strong abilities. Saying the author of the series is \"d riding\" characters is so incredibly immature.",

During the massacre, only three members of the clan had mangekyou (two excluding anime filler). That's what didn't make sense, since so many Uchiha would've faced losses during the wars. But that didn't make them OP since almost no one unlocked ms.\n\nLike I said, many central protagonists and antagonists are Uchiha, so it's natural those characters in particular get powerups based on their kekkei genkai. There are no main villains from the hyuga or yamanaka clan or something, so they don't seem as OP. (I would've liked those clans to have more of a role, but as things stand it makes sense).\n\nHow is ems a win button?
