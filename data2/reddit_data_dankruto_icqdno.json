In reality, pain is the way the body informs the brain that something dangerous or damaging is happening to it and encourages avoidance. During a fight, feeling no pain would mean that they could take untold amounts of damage without being alerted to it.\n\nTo be fair, this would be an issue for any character immune to pain. There are many cases in the real world of people without pain receptors who are severely injured for life due to the fact that they have hurt themselves or been hurt without their knowledge over and over.",

So the main cost is really just some chakra like any other jutsu, and obviously gotta keep the Naraka path alive.\n\nCreating them from scratch does seem like it takes some sort of preparation, at least inserting the black receiver rods in a corpse.",

I honestly don't think that he would feel pain from his bodies then again what he is going through at the time he may and just not react to it. But I don't think he would even need it tbh he has far more awareness than pain would give him because of the way he has eyes everywhere.",

In reality, pain is the way the body informs the brain that something dangerous or damaging is happening to it and encourages avoidance. During a fight, feeling no pain would mean that they could take untold amounts of damage without being alerted to it.\n\nTo be fair, this would be an issue for any character immune to pain. There are many cases in the real world of people without pain receptors who are severely injured for life due to the fact that they have hurt themselves or been hurt without their knowledge over and over.",

So the main cost is really just some chakra like any other jutsu, and obviously gotta keep the Naraka path alive.\n\nCreating them from scratch does seem like it takes some sort of preparation, at least inserting the black receiver rods in a corpse.",

So the main cost is really just some chakra like any other jutsu, and obviously gotta keep the Naraka path alive.\n\nCreating them from scratch does seem like it takes some sort of preparation, at least inserting the black receiver rods in a corpse.",
