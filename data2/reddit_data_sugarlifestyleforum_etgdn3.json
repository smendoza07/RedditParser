    "body": "My SB wants me to take her school clothes shopping.\n\nIt's only fair, since she's in the 9th grade.\n\n/s\n\nKidding, she's a senior in college.\n\nShe's not wanting a fancy purse or designer clothes, she mentioned some shoes (Vans for crying out loud) and some other clothes she wanted to get.\n\nHere's the thing - I hate shopping.\n\nSince I'm heading out of town for a bit I thought instead of being dragged along, I would give her an extra x2 PPM amount to go shopping with and tell her to take some photos and send them to me while I'm on my trip.\n\nI'll even put a little extra in there for her to go to Victoria Secret or buy something sexy for me to enjoy and get a few photos of.\n\nSB, would this be ok with you in place of your SD taking you shopping?\n\nSince I don't know what women's clothes cost and we can't talk specifics about money on here, I believe the amount I'm giving her would allow her to do everything listed above.",

She starts the real shopping. I give her 70% budget (but tell her this is 100%)\n\n(4) She can come back and deposit bags or show me what she has picked up\n\n(5) I complain a bit that his is all too expensive (in a fun way obviously). After she spent the 70%, I give her the other 30% and tell her to get some more\n\nThis way I have a \"shopping lite\" experience, see her excitement etc. In the end that wasn\u00b4t a bad experience at all.
