Mitsuki also refers to him using the gender-neutral term \u89aa (oya) meaning \u201cparent.\u201d \n\nPronouns are very infrequently used in Japanese in comparison with English. Grammatically, the predicate is the most important part of the sentence, and \u201cgood\u201d style in Japanese involves minimizing the use of grammatical subjects. \n\nIn anime, you hear a lot more demonstrative pronouns than in normal Japanese conversation (I guess this is what they\u2019re called?), like \u3053\u3044\u3064 (koitsu) or \u3042\u3044\u3064 (aitsu), but these depend on the speaker\u2019s physical relationship to/distance from the antecedent, and they mean something like \u201cthis person\u201d and \u201cthat person over there.\u201d They are not gender-specific.\n\nBecause of these features of Japanese grammar, \u201cgendered\u201d pronouns really aren\u2019t a thing like they are in English, so you hardly ever hear a character referred to as \u201che\u201d or \u201cshe,\u201d even though there are words for these in Japanese, i.e. \u5f7c (kare) and \u5f7c\u5973 (kanojo).\n\nHope this helps some explain why it\u2019s far easier to depict a gender-ambiguous character in a case like this than it ever would be in an English-language show.\n\nI\u2019m sure the dubbed version imposes \u201che\u201d onto Orochimaru all the time (and subtitles do too), but that\u2019s an active imposition by the translators necessitated by the above-discussed differences between Japanese and English. The pronoun \u201che\u201d isn\u2019t actually used much, if at all, in the Japanese dialogue, and it doesn\u2019t strike the listener as strange.",

Hell, he'd still survive regardless, so I guess as long as Orochimaru had curse marks to splooge out of he'd just outpace Kisame. Guess it'd depend on what the wincon was.\n\nAlthough now that you bring it up, it's crazy the difference in power Zabuza and Kisame had, even ignoring their swords. Zabuza was a top tier threat in the ninja world, signified by his 7 Swordsmen title, but his strongest jutsu was... Water Dragon Jutsu, which is basically like Mud Wall-tier. Meanwhile Kisame can drown a forest as a mid-level jutsu. Just another example of the power scale going to shit",

From what we seen and experienced 7 of em together with their swords is supposed to be 5 kage level threat which Dai needed the 8th gate to kill at least 4 of them. In shippuden, despite writing this as the lore they get taken out like bitches despite having unlimited chakra, an undying body AND THEIR SWORDS by whacko nobodies and a few jounin like wth. I at least wanna see half of the cast taking them on. It was one of the coolest concept wasted for more Naruto and Kakashi screentime which i dun hate but wished we got more out of the other members of the cast. The 2nd best is prolly Team Asuma which got their closure",

The problem is that he still managed to do something like that pretty much fresh out of the academy; Naruto at least had an excuse with the Shadow Clones multiplying his training efforts and straight up cheating out the jutsu, but Konohamaru *should've* been about on par with Chuunin Exam Naruto since Konohamaru isn't a literal retard when it comes to chakra. However, even that's not impressive since iirc Naruto's class was forced to take the exam early due to Orochimaru's actions behind the scenes, and Pain straight up merced two Chuunin without them even managing to react.\n\nIt just really devalues a lot of the established power scale imo when that super special jutsu that only a select few are capable of mastering is just capable of being mastered by a child that isn't using XP multipliers and getting an assist. I feel like if Part 1's scaling had been kept intact, Konohamaru would've gotten clapped almost instantly by a Pain that was maybe capable of destroying 1/50th of what Shippuden had him capable of. There certainly wouldn't have been that iconic Almighty Push scene, though I leave whether that's good or bad up to the individual.",

His chakra control, his combat experience, his physical training, his ability to use the Rasengan in the first place at such a young age is directly linked to the fact that he's more experienced than he should be thanks to using the clones.\n\nAlso, I disagree with the idea that Konohamaru would be above Naruto at that point simply by the fact that Naruto had insane amounts of chakra even without having reached his deal with Kurama. Naruto lacks in variety of jutsu but more than makes up for it in their power because he just pumps so much more chakra into every jutsu than anyone else; this is even outlined by Kakashi as he chastises him for wasting chakra that way since efficiency gets the job done just fine. Konohamaru would easily be a better ninja, but there's no way he should be stronger.",

Plus he's the 3rd Hokage's grandson, and he had the drive to work his butt off to get stronger. This series has a whole theme around inheriting power and junk. The kid managed to figure out how to do a rasengan from Naruto's crap tutoring. It stands to reason that he would be stronger than the average academy graduate. \n\nI agree he shouldn't be Defeating-Pain level, but he should be stronger than a genin at that point. That scene would have been more impactful if Konohamaru hit Pain with a rasengan and then gotten killed by Pain, since Kishimoto was planning to bring them all back anyway.",

He has menancing grosteque figure and his power is strong but still \"realistic\" in someway (at anime terms) and also not overpower at the same time. Also the ost and the va is also creepy when he appears. I check the va of orochimaru in english , japanese, and indonesia(my native language) the voice actor has the same creepy vibes that suited the character so i agree with op thought.",

Mitsuki also refers to him using the gender-neutral term \u89aa (oya) meaning \u201cparent.\u201d \n\nPronouns are very infrequently used in Japanese in comparison with English. Grammatically, the predicate is the most important part of the sentence, and \u201cgood\u201d style in Japanese involves minimizing the use of grammatical subjects. \n\nIn anime, you hear a lot more demonstrative pronouns than in normal Japanese conversation (I guess this is what they\u2019re called?), like \u3053\u3044\u3064 (koitsu) or \u3042\u3044\u3064 (aitsu), but these depend on the speaker\u2019s physical relationship to/distance from the antecedent, and they mean something like \u201cthis person\u201d and \u201cthat person over there.\u201d They are not gender-specific.\n\nBecause of these features of Japanese grammar, \u201cgendered\u201d pronouns really aren\u2019t a thing like they are in English, so you hardly ever hear a character referred to as \u201che\u201d or \u201cshe,\u201d even though there are words for these in Japanese, i.e. \u5f7c (kare) and \u5f7c\u5973 (kanojo).\n\nHope this helps some explain why it\u2019s far easier to depict a gender-ambiguous character in a case like this than it ever would be in an English-language show.\n\nI\u2019m sure the dubbed version imposes \u201che\u201d onto Orochimaru all the time (and subtitles do too), but that\u2019s an active imposition by the translators necessitated by the above-discussed differences between Japanese and English. The pronoun \u201che\u201d isn\u2019t actually used much, if at all, in the Japanese dialogue, and it doesn\u2019t strike the listener as strange.",

When he fuses with Samehada he's \"as strong as a tailed beast\", and Orochimaru had *some* difficulty dealing with 4 Tail Kyuubi at peak strength. Orochimaru would definitely put up a fight and get some good damage in, though. Hell, he'd still survive regardless, so I guess as long as Orochimaru had curse marks to splooge out of he'd just outpace Kisame. Guess it'd depend on what the wincon was.\n\nAlthough now that you bring it up, it's crazy the difference in power Zabuza and Kisame had, even ignoring their swords. Zabuza was a top tier threat in the ninja world, signified by his 7 Swordsmen title, but his strongest jutsu was... Water Dragon Jutsu, which is basically like Mud Wall-tier. Meanwhile Kisame can drown a forest as a mid-level jutsu. Just another example of the power scale going to shit",

In shippuden, despite writing this as the lore they get taken out like bitches despite having unlimited chakra, an undying body AND THEIR SWORDS by whacko nobodies and a few jounin like wth. I at least wanna see half of the cast taking them on. It was one of the coolest concept wasted for more Naruto and Kakashi screentime which i dun hate but wished we got more out of the other members of the cast. The 2nd best is prolly Team Asuma which got their closure",

The problem is that he still managed to do something like that pretty much fresh out of the academy; Naruto at least had an excuse with the Shadow Clones multiplying his training efforts and straight up cheating out the jutsu, but Konohamaru *should've* been about on par with Chuunin Exam Naruto since Konohamaru isn't a literal retard when it comes to chakra. However, even that's not impressive since iirc Naruto's class was forced to take the exam early due to Orochimaru's actions behind the scenes, and Pain straight up merced two Chuunin without them even managing to react.\n\nIt just really devalues a lot of the established power scale imo when that super special jutsu that only a select few are capable of mastering is just capable of being mastered by a child that isn't using XP multipliers and getting an assist. I feel like if Part 1's scaling had been kept intact, Konohamaru would've gotten clapped almost instantly by a Pain that was maybe capable of destroying 1/50th of what Shippuden had him capable of. There certainly wouldn't have been that iconic Almighty Push scene, though I leave whether that's good or bad up to the individual.",

His chakra control, his combat experience, his physical training, his ability to use the Rasengan in the first place at such a young age is directly linked to the fact that he's more experienced than he should be thanks to using the clones.\n\nAlso, I disagree with the idea that Konohamaru would be above Naruto at that point simply by the fact that Naruto had insane amounts of chakra even without having reached his deal with Kurama. Naruto lacks in variety of jutsu but more than makes up for it in their power because he just pumps so much more chakra into every jutsu than anyone else; this is even outlined by Kakashi as he chastises him for wasting chakra that way since efficiency gets the job done just fine. Konohamaru would easily be a better ninja, but there's no way he should be stronger.",

The kid managed to figure out how to do a rasengan from Naruto's crap tutoring. It stands to reason that he would be stronger than the average academy graduate. \n\nI agree he shouldn't be Defeating-Pain level, but he should be stronger than a genin at that point. That scene would have been more impactful if Konohamaru hit Pain with a rasengan and then gotten killed by Pain, since Kishimoto was planning to bring them all back anyway.",

Mitsuki also refers to him using the gender-neutral term \u89aa (oya) meaning \u201cparent.\u201d \n\nPronouns are very infrequently used in Japanese in comparison with English. Grammatically, the predicate is the most important part of the sentence, and \u201cgood\u201d style in Japanese involves minimizing the use of grammatical subjects. \n\nIn anime, you hear a lot more demonstrative pronouns than in normal Japanese conversation (I guess this is what they\u2019re called?), like \u3053\u3044\u3064 (koitsu) or \u3042\u3044\u3064 (aitsu), but these depend on the speaker\u2019s physical relationship to/distance from the antecedent, and they mean something like \u201cthis person\u201d and \u201cthat person over there.\u201d They are not gender-specific.\n\nBecause of these features of Japanese grammar, \u201cgendered\u201d pronouns really aren\u2019t a thing like they are in English, so you hardly ever hear a character referred to as \u201che\u201d or \u201cshe,\u201d even though there are words for these in Japanese, i.e. \u5f7c (kare) and \u5f7c\u5973 (kanojo).\n\nHope this helps some explain why it\u2019s far easier to depict a gender-ambiguous character in a case like this than it ever would be in an English-language show.\n\nI\u2019m sure the dubbed version imposes \u201che\u201d onto Orochimaru all the time (and subtitles do too), but that\u2019s an active imposition by the translators necessitated by the above-discussed differences between Japanese and English. The pronoun \u201che\u201d isn\u2019t actually used much, if at all, in the Japanese dialogue, and it doesn\u2019t strike the listener as strange.",

Hell, he'd still survive regardless, so I guess as long as Orochimaru had curse marks to splooge out of he'd just outpace Kisame. Guess it'd depend on what the wincon was.\n\nAlthough now that you bring it up, it's crazy the difference in power Zabuza and Kisame had, even ignoring their swords. Zabuza was a top tier threat in the ninja world, signified by his 7 Swordsmen title, but his strongest jutsu was... Water Dragon Jutsu, which is basically like Mud Wall-tier. Meanwhile Kisame can drown a forest as a mid-level jutsu. Just another example of the power scale going to shit",

In shippuden, despite writing this as the lore they get taken out like bitches despite having unlimited chakra, an undying body AND THEIR SWORDS by whacko nobodies and a few jounin like wth. I at least wanna see half of the cast taking them on. It was one of the coolest concept wasted for more Naruto and Kakashi screentime which i dun hate but wished we got more out of the other members of the cast.

The problem is that he still managed to do something like that pretty much fresh out of the academy; Naruto at least had an excuse with the Shadow Clones multiplying his training efforts and straight up cheating out the jutsu, but Konohamaru *should've* been about on par with Chuunin Exam Naruto since Konohamaru isn't a literal retard when it comes to chakra. However, even that's not impressive since iirc Naruto's class was forced to take the exam early due to Orochimaru's actions behind the scenes, and Pain straight up merced two Chuunin without them even managing to react.\n\nIt just really devalues a lot of the established power scale imo when that super special jutsu that only a select few are capable of mastering is just capable of being mastered by a child that isn't using XP multipliers and getting an assist. I feel like if Part 1's scaling had been kept intact, Konohamaru would've gotten clapped almost instantly by a Pain that was maybe capable of destroying 1/50th of what Shippuden had him capable of. There certainly wouldn't have been that iconic Almighty Push scene, though I leave whether that's good or bad up to the individual.",

Naruto lacks in variety of jutsu but more than makes up for it in their power because he just pumps so much more chakra into every jutsu than anyone else; this is even outlined by Kakashi as he chastises him for wasting chakra that way since efficiency gets the job done just fine. Konohamaru would easily be a better ninja, but there's no way he should be stronger.",

The kid managed to figure out how to do a rasengan from Naruto's crap tutoring. It stands to reason that he would be stronger than the average academy graduate. \n\nI agree he shouldn't be Defeating-Pain level, but he should be stronger than a genin at that point.

Mitsuki also refers to him using the gender-neutral term \u89aa (oya) meaning \u201cparent.\u201d \n\nPronouns are very infrequently used in Japanese in comparison with English. Grammatically, the predicate is the most important part of the sentence, and \u201cgood\u201d style in Japanese involves minimizing the use of grammatical subjects. \n\nIn anime, you hear a lot more demonstrative pronouns than in normal Japanese conversation (I guess this is what they\u2019re called?), like \u3053\u3044\u3064 (koitsu) or \u3042\u3044\u3064 (aitsu), but these depend on the speaker\u2019s physical relationship to/distance from the antecedent, and they mean something like \u201cthis person\u201d and \u201cthat person over there.\u201d They are not gender-specific.\n\nBecause of these features of Japanese grammar, \u201cgendered\u201d pronouns really aren\u2019t a thing like they are in English, so you hardly ever hear a character referred to as \u201che\u201d or \u201cshe,\u201d even though there are words for these in Japanese, i.e. \u5f7c (kare) and \u5f7c\u5973 (kanojo).\n\nHope this helps some explain why it\u2019s far easier to depict a gender-ambiguous character in a case like this than it ever would be in an English-language show.\n\nI\u2019m sure the dubbed version imposes \u201che\u201d onto Orochimaru all the time (and subtitles do too), but that\u2019s an active imposition by the translators necessitated by the above-discussed differences between Japanese and English. The pronoun \u201che\u201d isn\u2019t actually used much, if at all, in the Japanese dialogue, and it doesn\u2019t strike the listener as strange.",

Hell, he'd still survive regardless, so I guess as long as Orochimaru had curse marks to splooge out of he'd just outpace Kisame. Guess it'd depend on what the wincon was.\n\nAlthough now that you bring it up, it's crazy the difference in power Zabuza and Kisame had, even ignoring their swords. Zabuza was a top tier threat in the ninja world, signified by his 7 Swordsmen title, but his strongest jutsu was... Water Dragon Jutsu, which is basically like Mud Wall-tier. Meanwhile Kisame can drown a forest as a mid-level jutsu. Just another example of the power scale going to shit",

From what we seen and experienced 7 of em together with their swords is supposed to be 5 kage level threat which Dai needed the 8th gate to kill at least 4 of them. In shippuden, despite writing this as the lore they get taken out like bitches despite having unlimited chakra, an undying body AND THEIR SWORDS by whacko nobodies and a few jounin like wth. I at least wanna see half of the cast taking them on. It was one of the coolest concept wasted for more Naruto and Kakashi screentime which i dun hate but wished we got more out of the other members of the cast. The 2nd best is prolly Team Asuma which got their closure",

The problem is that he still managed to do something like that pretty much fresh out of the academy; Naruto at least had an excuse with the Shadow Clones multiplying his training efforts and straight up cheating out the jutsu, but Konohamaru *should've* been about on par with Chuunin Exam Naruto since Konohamaru isn't a literal retard when it comes to chakra. However, even that's not impressive since iirc Naruto's class was forced to take the exam early due to Orochimaru's actions behind the scenes, and Pain straight up merced two Chuunin without them even managing to react.\n\nIt just really devalues a lot of the established power scale imo when that super special jutsu that only a select few are capable of mastering is just capable of being mastered by a child that isn't using XP multipliers and getting an assist. I feel like if Part 1's scaling had been kept intact, Konohamaru would've gotten clapped almost instantly by a Pain that was maybe capable of destroying 1/50th of what Shippuden had him capable of. There certainly wouldn't have been that iconic Almighty Push scene, though I leave whether that's good or bad up to the individual.",

His chakra control, his combat experience, his physical training, his ability to use the Rasengan in the first place at such a young age is directly linked to the fact that he's more experienced than he should be thanks to using the clones.\n\nAlso, I disagree with the idea that Konohamaru would be above Naruto at that point simply by the fact that Naruto had insane amounts of chakra even without having reached his deal with Kurama. Naruto lacks in variety of jutsu but more than makes up for it in their power because he just pumps so much more chakra into every jutsu than anyone else; this is even outlined by Kakashi as he chastises him for wasting chakra that way since efficiency gets the job done just fine. Konohamaru would easily be a better ninja, but there's no way he should be stronger.",

Mitsuki also refers to him using the gender-neutral term \u89aa (oya) meaning \u201cparent.\u201d \n\nPronouns are very infrequently used in Japanese in comparison with English. Grammatically, the predicate is the most important part of the sentence, and \u201cgood\u201d style in Japanese involves minimizing the use of grammatical subjects. \n\nIn anime, you hear a lot more demonstrative pronouns than in normal Japanese conversation (I guess this is what they\u2019re called?), like \u3053\u3044\u3064 (koitsu) or \u3042\u3044\u3064 (aitsu), but these depend on the speaker\u2019s physical relationship to/distance from the antecedent, and they mean something like \u201cthis person\u201d and \u201cthat person over there.\u201d They are not gender-specific.\n\nBecause of these features of Japanese grammar, \u201cgendered\u201d pronouns really aren\u2019t a thing like they are in English, so you hardly ever hear a character referred to as \u201che\u201d or \u201cshe,\u201d even though there are words for these in Japanese, i.e. \u5f7c (kare) and \u5f7c\u5973 (kanojo).\n\nHope this helps some explain why it\u2019s far easier to depict a gender-ambiguous character in a case like this than it ever would be in an English-language show.\n\nI\u2019m sure the dubbed version imposes \u201che\u201d onto Orochimaru all the time (and subtitles do too), but that\u2019s an active imposition by the translators necessitated by the above-discussed differences between Japanese and English. The pronoun \u201che\u201d isn\u2019t actually used much, if at all, in the Japanese dialogue, and it doesn\u2019t strike the listener as strange.",

When he fuses with Samehada he's \"as strong as a tailed beast\", and Orochimaru had *some* difficulty dealing with 4 Tail Kyuubi at peak strength. Orochimaru would definitely put up a fight and get some good damage in, though. Hell, he'd still survive regardless, so I guess as long as Orochimaru had curse marks to splooge out of he'd just outpace Kisame. Guess it'd depend on what the wincon was.\n\nAlthough now that you bring it up, it's crazy the difference in power Zabuza and Kisame had, even ignoring their swords. Zabuza was a top tier threat in the ninja world, signified by his 7 Swordsmen title, but his strongest jutsu was... Water Dragon Jutsu, which is basically like Mud Wall-tier. Meanwhile Kisame can drown a forest as a mid-level jutsu. Just another example of the power scale going to shit",

In shippuden, despite writing this as the lore they get taken out like bitches despite having unlimited chakra, an undying body AND THEIR SWORDS by whacko nobodies and a few jounin like wth. I at least wanna see half of the cast taking them on. It was one of the coolest concept wasted for more Naruto and Kakashi screentime which i dun hate but wished we got more out of the other members of the cast. The 2nd best is prolly Team Asuma which got their closure",

The problem is that he still managed to do something like that pretty much fresh out of the academy; Naruto at least had an excuse with the Shadow Clones multiplying his training efforts and straight up cheating out the jutsu, but Konohamaru *should've* been about on par with Chuunin Exam Naruto since Konohamaru isn't a literal retard when it comes to chakra. However, even that's not impressive since iirc Naruto's class was forced to take the exam early due to Orochimaru's actions behind the scenes, and Pain straight up merced two Chuunin without them even managing to react.\n\nIt just really devalues a lot of the established power scale imo when that super special jutsu that only a select few are capable of mastering is just capable of being mastered by a child that isn't using XP multipliers and getting an assist. I feel like if Part 1's scaling had been kept intact, Konohamaru would've gotten clapped almost instantly by a Pain that was maybe capable of destroying 1/50th of what Shippuden had him capable of. There certainly wouldn't have been that iconic Almighty Push scene, though I leave whether that's good or bad up to the individual.",

His chakra control, his combat experience, his physical training, his ability to use the Rasengan in the first place at such a young age is directly linked to the fact that he's more experienced than he should be thanks to using the clones.\n\nAlso, I disagree with the idea that Konohamaru would be above Naruto at that point simply by the fact that Naruto had insane amounts of chakra even without having reached his deal with Kurama. Naruto lacks in variety of jutsu but more than makes up for it in their power because he just pumps so much more chakra into every jutsu than anyone else; this is even outlined by Kakashi as he chastises him for wasting chakra that way since efficiency gets the job done just fine. Konohamaru would easily be a better ninja, but there's no way he should be stronger.",

Mitsuki also refers to him using the gender-neutral term \u89aa (oya) meaning \u201cparent.\u201d \n\nPronouns are very infrequently used in Japanese in comparison with English. Grammatically, the predicate is the most important part of the sentence, and \u201cgood\u201d style in Japanese involves minimizing the use of grammatical subjects. \n\nIn anime, you hear a lot more demonstrative pronouns than in normal Japanese conversation (I guess this is what they\u2019re called?), like \u3053\u3044\u3064 (koitsu) or \u3042\u3044\u3064 (aitsu), but these depend on the speaker\u2019s physical relationship to/distance from the antecedent, and they mean something like \u201cthis person\u201d and \u201cthat person over there.\u201d They are not gender-specific.\n\nBecause of these features of Japanese grammar, \u201cgendered\u201d pronouns really aren\u2019t a thing like they are in English, so you hardly ever hear a character referred to as \u201che\u201d or \u201cshe,\u201d even though there are words for these in Japanese, i.e. \u5f7c (kare) and \u5f7c\u5973 (kanojo).\n\nHope this helps some explain why it\u2019s far easier to depict a gender-ambiguous character in a case like this than it ever would be in an English-language show.\n\nI\u2019m sure the dubbed version imposes \u201che\u201d onto Orochimaru all the time (and subtitles do too), but that\u2019s an active imposition by the translators necessitated by the above-discussed differences between Japanese and English. The pronoun \u201che\u201d isn\u2019t actually used much, if at all, in the Japanese dialogue, and it doesn\u2019t strike the listener as strange.",

In shippuden, despite writing this as the lore they get taken out like bitches despite having unlimited chakra, an undying body AND THEIR SWORDS by whacko nobodies and a few jounin like wth. I at least wanna see half of the cast taking them on. It was one of the coolest concept wasted for more Naruto and Kakashi screentime which i dun hate but wished we got more out of the other members of the cast.

His chakra control, his combat experience, his physical training, his ability to use the Rasengan in the first place at such a young age is directly linked to the fact that he's more experienced than he should be thanks to using the clones.\n\nAlso, I disagree with the idea that Konohamaru would be above Naruto at that point simply by the fact that Naruto had insane amounts of chakra even without having reached his deal with Kurama. Naruto lacks in variety of jutsu but more than makes up for it in their power because he just pumps so much more chakra into every jutsu than anyone else; this is even outlined by Kakashi as he chastises him for wasting chakra that way since efficiency gets the job done just fine. Konohamaru would easily be a better ninja, but there's no way he should be stronger.",

Mitsuki also refers to him using the gender-neutral term \u89aa (oya) meaning \u201cparent.\u201d \n\nPronouns are very infrequently used in Japanese in comparison with English. Grammatically, the predicate is the most important part of the sentence, and \u201cgood\u201d style in Japanese involves minimizing the use of grammatical subjects. \n\nIn anime, you hear a lot more demonstrative pronouns than in normal Japanese conversation (I guess this is what they\u2019re called?), like \u3053\u3044\u3064 (koitsu) or \u3042\u3044\u3064 (aitsu), but these depend on the speaker\u2019s physical relationship to/distance from the antecedent, and they mean something like \u201cthis person\u201d and \u201cthat person over there.\u201d They are not gender-specific.\n\nBecause of these features of Japanese grammar, \u201cgendered\u201d pronouns really aren\u2019t a thing like they are in English, so you hardly ever hear a character referred to as \u201che\u201d or \u201cshe,\u201d even though there are words for these in Japanese, i.e. \u5f7c (kare) and \u5f7c\u5973 (kanojo).\n\nHope this helps some explain why it\u2019s far easier to depict a gender-ambiguous character in a case like this than it ever would be in an English-language show.\n\nI\u2019m sure the dubbed version imposes \u201che\u201d onto Orochimaru all the time (and subtitles do too), but that\u2019s an active imposition by the translators necessitated by the above-discussed differences between Japanese and English. The pronoun \u201che\u201d isn\u2019t actually used much, if at all, in the Japanese dialogue, and it doesn\u2019t strike the listener as strange.",

His chakra control, his combat experience, his physical training, his ability to use the Rasengan in the first place at such a young age is directly linked to the fact that he's more experienced than he should be thanks to using the clones.\n\nAlso, I disagree with the idea that Konohamaru would be above Naruto at that point simply by the fact that Naruto had insane amounts of chakra even without having reached his deal with Kurama. Naruto lacks in variety of jutsu but more than makes up for it in their power because he just pumps so much more chakra into every jutsu than anyone else; this is even outlined by Kakashi as he chastises him for wasting chakra that way since efficiency gets the job done just fine. Konohamaru would easily be a better ninja, but there's no way he should be stronger.",

Mitsuki also refers to him using the gender-neutral term \u89aa (oya) meaning \u201cparent.\u201d \n\nPronouns are very infrequently used in Japanese in comparison with English. Grammatically, the predicate is the most important part of the sentence, and \u201cgood\u201d style in Japanese involves minimizing the use of grammatical subjects. \n\nIn anime, you hear a lot more demonstrative pronouns than in normal Japanese conversation (I guess this is what they\u2019re called?), like \u3053\u3044\u3064 (koitsu) or \u3042\u3044\u3064 (aitsu), but these depend on the speaker\u2019s physical relationship to/distance from the antecedent, and they mean something like \u201cthis person\u201d and \u201cthat person over there.\u201d They are not gender-specific.\n\nBecause of these features of Japanese grammar, \u201cgendered\u201d pronouns really aren\u2019t a thing like they are in English, so you hardly ever hear a character referred to as \u201che\u201d or \u201cshe,\u201d even though there are words for these in Japanese, i.e. \u5f7c (kare) and \u5f7c\u5973 (kanojo).\n\nHope this helps some explain why it\u2019s far easier to depict a gender-ambiguous character in a case like this than it ever would be in an English-language show.\n\nI\u2019m sure the dubbed version imposes \u201che\u201d onto Orochimaru all the time (and subtitles do too), but that\u2019s an active imposition by the translators necessitated by the above-discussed differences between Japanese and English. The pronoun \u201che\u201d isn\u2019t actually used much, if at all, in the Japanese dialogue, and it doesn\u2019t strike the listener as strange.",

Mitsuki also refers to him using the gender-neutral term \u89aa (oya) meaning \u201cparent.\u201d \n\nPronouns are very infrequently used in Japanese in comparison with English. Grammatically, the predicate is the most important part of the sentence, and \u201cgood\u201d style in Japanese involves minimizing the use of grammatical subjects. \n\nIn anime, you hear a lot more demonstrative pronouns than in normal Japanese conversation (I guess this is what they\u2019re called?), like \u3053\u3044\u3064 (koitsu) or \u3042\u3044\u3064 (aitsu), but these depend on the speaker\u2019s physical relationship to/distance from the antecedent, and they mean something like \u201cthis person\u201d and \u201cthat person over there.\u201d They are not gender-specific.\n\nBecause of these features of Japanese grammar, \u201cgendered\u201d pronouns really aren\u2019t a thing like they are in English, so you hardly ever hear a character referred to as \u201che\u201d or \u201cshe,\u201d even though there are words for these in Japanese, i.e. \u5f7c (kare) and \u5f7c\u5973 (kanojo).\n\nHope this helps some explain why it\u2019s far easier to depict a gender-ambiguous character in a case like this than it ever would be in an English-language show.\n\nI\u2019m sure the dubbed version imposes \u201che\u201d onto Orochimaru all the time (and subtitles do too), but that\u2019s an active imposition by the translators necessitated by the above-discussed differences between Japanese and English. The pronoun \u201che\u201d isn\u2019t actually used much, if at all, in the Japanese dialogue, and it doesn\u2019t strike the listener as strange.",
