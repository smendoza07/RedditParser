But honestly, in my opinion, Sasuke and Sakura do not have a 100th of the patience and persistence that Naruto has. If it was Naruto that was taken by Orochimaaru, and Sasuke/Sakura stayed the same, I am 100% sure that Naruto would be Obito 2.0 and would be on Madara's side of the war. \n\nOnly deterrent being Minato and Kushina's soul. But again, I don't blame Obito. Not everyone has Naruto's kindness and forgiving nature... \n\nSakura is trash btw, let's reaffirm that :)",

If not that, then that he is valuable. After all, when Sasuke got taken away, it was only Naruto's squad that did jack. Everyone else seemed like they didn't care or didn't put as much effort as they could have. \n\nHaving said that, we can assume that Orochimaaru would also know he's valuable and thus the attack by Akatsuki would be accelerated now that Sasuke wasn't kidnapped. By that I mean that Itachi and Kisame wouldn't attack Konohagakure to deter it from disposing off Sasuke.",

At one point (i believe it was these 4) the Animal, Deva, Asura, and Human paths were still standing and in 1 Rasenshuriken he made Deva and Asura jump while the Human Path had to sacrifice himself to save the Animal. I could be wrong on the specific 4 but that did happen. Additionally, aside from when Diva was in near range of Nagato alone (recieving his full power all at once), Naruto only ever struggled when Sage Mode was lost. Aside from that he just handled the Paths. So while you could argue a 100% power Diva Path would beat Sage Naruto, the power split among the 6 is a different matter entirely.",

But again, I don't blame Obito. Not everyone has Naruto's kindness and forgiving nature... \n\nSakura is trash btw, let's reaffirm that :)",

Everyone else seemed like they didn't care or didn't put as much effort as they could have. \n\nHaving said that, we can assume that Orochimaaru would also know he's valuable and thus the attack by Akatsuki would be accelerated now that Sasuke wasn't kidnapped.

At one point (i believe it was these 4) the Animal, Deva, Asura, and Human paths were still standing and in 1 Rasenshuriken he made Deva and Asura jump while the Human Path had to sacrifice himself to save the Animal. I could be wrong on the specific 4 but that did happen. Additionally, aside from when Diva was in near range of Nagato alone (recieving his full power all at once), Naruto only ever struggled when Sage Mode was lost. Aside from that he just handled the Paths. So while you could argue a 100% power Diva Path would beat Sage Naruto, the power split among the 6 is a different matter entirely.",

He didn't stand a chance of winning, but he still fought.\n\nGaara is everything I wish I could be.",

Sasuke would go after him for power then Sakura would cry on a bench after getting scolded by Sasuke on how she forgot about Naruto.

Which isn't a lot considering the leafs size, but still.",

At one point (i believe it was these 4) the Animal, Deva, Asura, and Human paths were still standing and in 1 Rasenshuriken he made Deva and Asura jump while the Human Path had to sacrifice himself to save the Animal. I could be wrong on the specific 4 but that did happen. Additionally, aside from when Diva was in near range of Nagato alone (recieving his full power all at once), Naruto only ever struggled when Sage Mode was lost. Aside from that he just handled the Paths. So while you could argue a 100% power Diva Path would beat Sage Naruto, the power split among the 6 is a different matter entirely.",

If not that, then that he is valuable. After all, when Sasuke got taken away, it was only Naruto's squad that did jack. Everyone else seemed like they didn't care or didn't put as much effort as they could have. \n\nHaving said that, we can assume that Orochimaaru would also know he's valuable and thus the attack by Akatsuki would be accelerated now that Sasuke wasn't kidnapped. By that I mean that Itachi and Kisame wouldn't attack Konohagakure to deter it from disposing off Sasuke.",

At one point (i believe it was these 4) the Animal, Deva, Asura, and Human paths were still standing and in 1 Rasenshuriken he made Deva and Asura jump while the Human Path had to sacrifice himself to save the Animal. I could be wrong on the specific 4 but that did happen. Additionally, aside from when Diva was in near range of Nagato alone (recieving his full power all at once), Naruto only ever struggled when Sage Mode was lost. Aside from that he just handled the Paths. So while you could argue a 100% power Diva Path would beat Sage Naruto, the power split among the 6 is a different matter entirely.",

If that instance you're referring to with the rasenshuriken happened whilst Deva had his powers then he could have just stopped the rasenshuriken with a shinra tensei, Naruto would have been swarmed by the animals from the animal path as well.\n\nAlso there's no argument to be had, as soon as Deva gained his power back he would have beat Sage Mode Naruto who has displayed nothing to counter the abilities whilst fighting by himself against all 6 paths.",

At one point (i believe it was these 4) the Animal, Deva, Asura, and Human paths were still standing and in 1 Rasenshuriken he made Deva and Asura jump while the Human Path had to sacrifice himself to save the Animal. I could be wrong on the specific 4 but that did happen. Additionally, aside from when Diva was in near range of Nagato alone (recieving his full power all at once), Naruto only ever struggled when Sage Mode was lost. Aside from that he just handled the Paths. So while you could argue a 100% power Diva Path would beat Sage Naruto, the power split among the 6 is a different matter entirely.",

He was seen as a weapon his whole life, and he spent years upon years of it trying to be accepted. And he became Kazekage. The village leader. But many people still didn't trust him, with frequent assassination attempt. He survived through every one. He was thrust into another war by a man who whose organization had once killed him, and nearly killed his brother, but he stayed calm through it all, just to protect his closest friend. He had to fight his own father, and he won. He fought against Madara, an undead god of shinobi, even after sustaining serious injury beforehand. He knew he would lose, and probably die, and he stood strong. He didn't have a deus ex Kurama to save him. He didn't stand a chance of winning, but he still fought.\n\nGaara is everything I wish I could be.",

At one point (i believe it was these 4) the Animal, Deva, Asura, and Human paths were still standing and in 1 Rasenshuriken he made Deva and Asura jump while the Human Path had to sacrifice himself to save the Animal. I could be wrong on the specific 4 but that did happen. Additionally, aside from when Diva was in near range of Nagato alone (recieving his full power all at once), Naruto only ever struggled when Sage Mode was lost. Aside from that he just handled the Paths. So while you could argue a 100% power Diva Path would beat Sage Naruto, the power split among the 6 is a different matter entirely.",

He was seen as a weapon his whole life, and he spent years upon years of it trying to be accepted. And he became Kazekage. The village leader. But many people still didn't trust him, with frequent assassination attempt. He survived through every one. He was thrust into another war by a man who whose organization had once killed him, and nearly killed his brother, but he stayed calm through it all, just to protect his closest friend. He had to fight his own father, and he won. He fought against Madara, an undead god of shinobi, even after sustaining serious injury beforehand. He knew he would lose, and probably die, and he stood strong. He didn't have a deus ex Kurama to save him. He didn't stand a chance of winning, but he still fought.\n\nGaara is everything I wish I could be.",

At one point (i believe it was these 4) the Animal, Deva, Asura, and Human paths were still standing and in 1 Rasenshuriken he made Deva and Asura jump while the Human Path had to sacrifice himself to save the Animal. I could be wrong on the specific 4 but that did happen. Additionally, aside from when Diva was in near range of Nagato alone (recieving his full power all at once), Naruto only ever struggled when Sage Mode was lost. Aside from that he just handled the Paths. So while you could argue a 100% power Diva Path would beat Sage Naruto, the power split among the 6 is a different matter entirely.",

He knew he would lose, and probably die, and he stood strong. He didn't have a deus ex Kurama to save him. He didn't stand a chance of winning, but he still fought.\n\nGaara is everything I wish I could be.",

If not that, then that he is valuable. After all, when Sasuke got taken away, it was only Naruto's squad that did jack. Everyone else seemed like they didn't care or didn't put as much effort as they could have. \n\nHaving said that, we can assume that Orochimaaru would also know he's valuable and thus the attack by Akatsuki would be accelerated now that Sasuke wasn't kidnapped. By that I mean that Itachi and Kisame wouldn't attack Konohagakure to deter it from disposing off Sasuke.",

At one point (i believe it was these 4) the Animal, Deva, Asura, and Human paths were still standing and in 1 Rasenshuriken he made Deva and Asura jump while the Human Path had to sacrifice himself to save the Animal. I could be wrong on the specific 4 but that did happen. Additionally, aside from when Diva was in near range of Nagato alone (recieving his full power all at once), Naruto only ever struggled when Sage Mode was lost. Aside from that he just handled the Paths. So while you could argue a 100% power Diva Path would beat Sage Naruto, the power split among the 6 is a different matter entirely.",

If that instance you're referring to with the rasenshuriken happened whilst Deva had his powers then he could have just stopped the rasenshuriken with a shinra tensei, Naruto would have been swarmed by the animals from the animal path as well.\n\nAlso there's no argument to be had, as soon as Deva gained his power back he would have beat Sage Mode Naruto who has displayed nothing to counter the abilities whilst fighting by himself against all 6 paths.",

At one point (i believe it was these 4) the Animal, Deva, Asura, and Human paths were still standing and in 1 Rasenshuriken he made Deva and Asura jump while the Human Path had to sacrifice himself to save the Animal. I could be wrong on the specific 4 but that did happen. Additionally, aside from when Diva was in near range of Nagato alone (recieving his full power all at once), Naruto only ever struggled when Sage Mode was lost. Aside from that he just handled the Paths. So while you could argue a 100% power Diva Path would beat Sage Naruto, the power split among the 6 is a different matter entirely.",

I could be wrong on the specific 4 but that did happen. Additionally, aside from when Diva was in near range of Nagato alone (recieving his full power all at once), Naruto only ever struggled when Sage Mode was lost. Aside from that he just handled the Paths. So while you could argue a 100% power Diva Path would beat Sage Naruto, the power split among the 6 is a different matter entirely.",

At one point (i believe it was these 4) the Animal, Deva, Asura, and Human paths were still standing and in 1 Rasenshuriken he made Deva and Asura jump while the Human Path had to sacrifice himself to save the Animal. I could be wrong on the specific 4 but that did happen. Additionally, aside from when Diva was in near range of Nagato alone (recieving his full power all at once), Naruto only ever struggled when Sage Mode was lost. Aside from that he just handled the Paths. So while you could argue a 100% power Diva Path would beat Sage Naruto, the power split among the 6 is a different matter entirely.",

At one point (i believe it was these 4) the Animal, Deva, Asura, and Human paths were still standing and in 1 Rasenshuriken he made Deva and Asura jump while the Human Path had to sacrifice himself to save the Animal. I could be wrong on the specific 4 but that did happen. Additionally, aside from when Diva was in near range of Nagato alone (recieving his full power all at once), Naruto only ever struggled when Sage Mode was lost. Aside from that he just handled the Paths. So while you could argue a 100% power Diva Path would beat Sage Naruto, the power split among the 6 is a different matter entirely.",

At one point (i believe it was these 4) the Animal, Deva, Asura, and Human paths were still standing and in 1 Rasenshuriken he made Deva and Asura jump while the Human Path had to sacrifice himself to save the Animal. I could be wrong on the specific 4 but that did happen. Additionally, aside from when Diva was in near range of Nagato alone (recieving his full power all at once), Naruto only ever struggled when Sage Mode was lost. Aside from that he just handled the Paths. So while you could argue a 100% power Diva Path would beat Sage Naruto, the power split among the 6 is a different matter entirely.",
