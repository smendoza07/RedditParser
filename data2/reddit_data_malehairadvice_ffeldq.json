Or use a pre-styler first then follow it up with blow-drying. \n\nIf you find current styling products to be too hard to style with, try using a more lightweight product. You can find some great products and advice from Blumaan's website and YouTube Channel. \n\nI think the haircut looks great for now, definitely don't go bald and keep looking for ways to tweek your haircut to make it more personal. \n\nI've been there man, I have super 'fine' hair but I have lots of it. This means it's really hard to style if my hair is long, or if I use the wrong products. Couple this with the fact that my hair gets very oily, very fast, and I end up having a 20min styling process every day. After trying many styles, both short and longer, I settled on one based on opinions and personal preferences. It's been nearly 3 years since I started really caring about my hair, and I've just started receiving compliments about it. (The first two years were a complete disaster). \n\nGood luck man, let me know if you have any other questions, I'm happy to help.\n\nEdit: spelling",

If you want, I\u2019m willing to bet that as your hair will be easier to style once it gets a bit longer and has more weight, so you could maybe grow out the top a bit longer?
