I try to get my hair as dry as possible on the cool setting before putting in the sea salt. I use a small amount maybe like 2 sprays max and I spray it into my palms not directly into my hair. Use my hands to rub it in and then use the high heat and my hands to style it. My part is actually a happy accident that I\u2019ve just come to accept, I usually prefer to have the bulk of my parted one way but my left leaning middle part is very adamant on its own, even with product and heat",

If I shampooed that day then I use a coconut oil spray and blow dry it in to diffuse it. A very very small amount of the oil, like one spray rubbed between my palms and then through my hair. The brand for the oil and my shampoo and conditioner is Maui, it smells v good and I\u2019m p sure it\u2019s vegan. I also use dry shampoo when I get a little greasy but not enough to warrant a full shampoo. \n\n\nOtherwise I try to keep the heat to a minimum and use the cool setting on my blow dryer which also helps with getting a nice not pomade-y shine. I use heat to get the height I want, though. For styling I use a paste and a sea salt spray. I\u2019m also considering adding a 10 in 1 I\u2019ve been stealing from my gf the last few days. It\u2019s like a leave in conditioner, detangler, heat protector, probably protects me from demons and Valkyrie too. It\u2019s been leaving my hair very soft and bouncy. It\u2019s \u201cnot your mothers\u201d brand and it\u2019s called \u201call eyes on me.\u201d \n\n\nHope this helps! My mother did also just bless me with hair and skin I do not deserve.",

If I shampooed that day then I use a coconut oil spray and blow dry it in to diffuse it. A very very small amount of the oil, like one spray rubbed between my palms and then through my hair. The brand for the oil and my shampoo and conditioner is Maui, it smells v good and I\u2019m p sure it\u2019s vegan. I also use dry shampoo when I get a little greasy but not enough to warrant a full shampoo. \n\n\nOtherwise I try to keep the heat to a minimum and use the cool setting on my blow dryer which also helps with getting a nice not pomade-y shine. I use heat to get the height I want, though. For styling I use a paste and a sea salt spray. I\u2019m also considering adding a 10 in 1 I\u2019ve been stealing from my gf the last few days. It\u2019s like a leave in conditioner, detangler, heat protector, probably protects me from demons and Valkyrie too. It\u2019s been leaving my hair very soft and bouncy. It\u2019s \u201cnot your mothers\u201d brand and it\u2019s called \u201call eyes on me.\u201d \n\n\nHope this helps! My mother did also just bless me with hair and skin I do not deserve.",

I just do not have the barber experience to feel confident enough about taking scissors to my curly mop, lol. Apparent length just varies too much on how I washed it and how much effort I put into evenly drying it to maximize curls.",
