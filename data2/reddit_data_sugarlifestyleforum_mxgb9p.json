    "body": "So my life is a joke. A weird situation roughly three months ago involving some friends and a guy that was interested in me led to my friends spilling that I sugar/sugared. Guy and me don't talk for a while but then we do and he asked me whether that was true. I said yeah because I have all those mutual friends with him who can corroborate even if I lie. \n\nHe makes tonnes of jokes about it, good-natured stuff talking about 'I got an envelope of cash fo you', and 'I'll love on you so good your whore ass will forget about the money' (I'm paraphrasing but it felt like good-natured roasting). So we see each other recently and we're talking. The subject comes to sex work and I make a comment about being in compensated relationships and he's like:\n\n\"WTF you weren't kidding about that??\"\n\nand now dude is mad. He was like \"but you lost your virginity so late(in my twnties), and you're so naive(rude) and you got so wet when i touched you (??? do you stop getting wet when you have sex for money?).\"\n\nAnyway, dude is sulking at the moment. IDK what to do. He told me to lie next time if it came up with a guy, especially if I really like him. \n\nHeh.",

If you're going to say that any time someone gives someone something of value in expectation of sex it is prostitution, then every relationship is prostitution at times. Legally and practically there is more to prostitution than I give you something of value and we have sex. It is very rare for any relationship to be based on complete financial equality, so one person is almost always getting paid.\n\nThere are escorts on SA and some sugar babies who are operating very similarly to escorts, for sure. But in my experience most sugar relationships have a lot more in common with vanilla dating than prostitution.",

The letter of most prostitution laws could apply to almost all sexual relationships at some point. But the law is not applied as you suggest. The general application is that there needs to be an offer of specific sexual acts in return for payment. Sure, police can arrest any of us for anything and we can be prosecuted, but the case will be thrown out quickly if it gets to court. I am not aware of a single precedent of SB/SD being successfully prosecuted for prostitution. Are you?\n\nThird, by limiting your definition to the legal definition, you ignore all the ways in which the behavior of most SBs is very, very different from the behavior of escorts.\n\nEscorts are usually very talented and lovely performers who provide a great service. They are athletes, actors, therapists and entrepreneurs who are unfairly stigmatized by society. So being called an escort should not be shaming, but it often is. Calling something prostitution is pretty much always derogatory, unfortunately.\n\nOf course there are SBs who cross the line. I recently had a brief discussion with a POT who, while we were discussing ppm, wanted to tell me about how good she is at BJ's. As noted above, offering payment in exchange for specific sexual acts is what they prosecute as prostitution. Was she a sting, a SB/escort who didn't know better, or just very proud of her BJ's? I'll never know.",

Although legislation is slow as always to adopt new language, the differentiation represents both the wholistic element of sex work as a labor entity while also recognizing that sex work is not monolithic. We don\u2019t need to lobby for needle exchange programs and secure housing solutions for cam girls, for example. To equate sugaring, which is relatively safe and done with full agency within the context of sex work, with prostitution, which is often in tandem with homelessness and substance abuse and occurs as a survival means in which meaningful consent cannot be given, is disingenuous.",

Sugar is sex work. Sugar is not prostitution. There is a difference. Almost all  prostitutes and sugar babies behave differently and are viewed differently under the law as currently applied in the US.\n\nI guess in your world porn stars and cam girls are prostitutes, too, since they engage in sex acts for money, meeting the same broad standard you've chosen.  There are various types of sex work and they are different. I know that makes things more complicated and conflicts with your personal narrative of being a teller of inconvenient truths to the deluded, but it's real my dear.",

If you're going to say that any time someone gives someone something of value in expectation of sex it is prostitution, then every relationship is prostitution at times. Legally and practically there is more to prostitution than I give you something of value and we have sex. It is very rare for any relationship to be based on complete financial equality, so one person is almost always getting paid.\n\nThere are escorts on SA and some sugar babies who are operating very similarly to escorts, for sure. But in my experience most sugar relationships have a lot more in common with vanilla dating than prostitution.",

The letter of most prostitution laws could apply to almost all sexual relationships at some point. But the law is not applied as you suggest. The general application is that there needs to be an offer of specific sexual acts in return for payment. Sure, police can arrest any of us for anything and we can be prosecuted, but the case will be thrown out quickly if it gets to court. I am not aware of a single precedent of SB/SD being successfully prosecuted for prostitution. Are you?\n\nThird, by limiting your definition to the legal definition, you ignore all the ways in which the behavior of most SBs is very, very different from the behavior of escorts.\n\nEscorts are usually very talented and lovely performers who provide a great service. They are athletes, actors, therapists and entrepreneurs who are unfairly stigmatized by society. So being called an escort should not be shaming, but it often is. Calling something prostitution is pretty much always derogatory, unfortunately.\n\nOf course there are SBs who cross the line. I recently had a brief discussion with a POT who, while we were discussing ppm, wanted to tell me about how good she is at BJ's. As noted above, offering payment in exchange for specific sexual acts is what they prosecute as prostitution. Was she a sting, a SB/escort who didn't know better, or just very proud of her BJ's? I'll never know.",

If you're going to say that any time someone gives someone something of value in expectation of sex it is prostitution, then every relationship is prostitution at times. Legally and practically there is more to prostitution than I give you something of value and we have sex. It is very rare for any relationship to be based on complete financial equality, so one person is almost always getting paid.\n\nThere are escorts on SA and some sugar babies who are operating very similarly to escorts, for sure. But in my experience most sugar relationships have a lot more in common with vanilla dating than prostitution.",

The letter of most prostitution laws could apply to almost all sexual relationships at some point. But the law is not applied as you suggest. The general application is that there needs to be an offer of specific sexual acts in return for payment. Sure, police can arrest any of us for anything and we can be prosecuted, but the case will be thrown out quickly if it gets to court. I am not aware of a single precedent of SB/SD being successfully prosecuted for prostitution. Are you?\n\nThird, by limiting your definition to the legal definition, you ignore all the ways in which the behavior of most SBs is very, very different from the behavior of escorts.\n\nEscorts are usually very talented and lovely performers who provide a great service. They are athletes, actors, therapists and entrepreneurs who are unfairly stigmatized by society. So being called an escort should not be shaming, but it often is. Calling something prostitution is pretty much always derogatory, unfortunately.\n\nOf course there are SBs who cross the line. I recently had a brief discussion with a POT who, while we were discussing ppm, wanted to tell me about how good she is at BJ's. As noted above, offering payment in exchange for specific sexual acts is what they prosecute as prostitution. Was she a sting, a SB/escort who didn't know better, or just very proud of her BJ's? I'll never know.",

The letter of most prostitution laws could apply to almost all sexual relationships at some point. But the law is not applied as you suggest. The general application is that there needs to be an offer of specific sexual acts in return for payment. Sure, police can arrest any of us for anything and we can be prosecuted, but the case will be thrown out quickly if it gets to court. I am not aware of a single precedent of SB/SD being successfully prosecuted for prostitution. Are you?\n\nThird, by limiting your definition to the legal definition, you ignore all the ways in which the behavior of most SBs is very, very different from the behavior of escorts.\n\nEscorts are usually very talented and lovely performers who provide a great service. They are athletes, actors, therapists and entrepreneurs who are unfairly stigmatized by society. So being called an escort should not be shaming, but it often is. Calling something prostitution is pretty much always derogatory, unfortunately.\n\nOf course there are SBs who cross the line. I recently had a brief discussion with a POT who, while we were discussing ppm, wanted to tell me about how good she is at BJ's. As noted above, offering payment in exchange for specific sexual acts is what they prosecute as prostitution. Was she a sting, a SB/escort who didn't know better, or just very proud of her BJ's? I'll never know.",

                    "body": "First, to be clear the strength of my objection to calling sugaring prostitution is because that argument is often used to shame and manipulate sugar babies, often to refuse to pay them as agreed, etc.\n\nSecond, your argument ignores legal precedent. The letter of most prostitution laws could apply to almost all sexual relationships at some point. But the law is not applied as you suggest. The general application is that there needs to be an offer of specific sexual acts in return for payment. Sure, police can arrest any of us for anything and we can be prosecuted, but the case will be thrown out quickly if it gets to court. I am not aware of a single precedent of SB/SD being successfully prosecuted for prostitution. Are you?\n\nThird, by limiting your definition to the legal definition, you ignore all the ways in which the behavior of most SBs is very, very different from the behavior of escorts.\n\nEscorts are usually very talented and lovely performers who provide a great service. They are athletes, actors, therapists and entrepreneurs who are unfairly stigmatized by society. So being called an escort should not be shaming, but it often is. Calling something prostitution is pretty much always derogatory, unfortunately.\n\nOf course there are SBs who cross the line. I recently had a brief discussion with a POT who, while we were discussing ppm, wanted to tell me about how good she is at BJ's. As noted above, offering payment in exchange for specific sexual acts is what they prosecute as prostitution. Was she a sting, a SB/escort who didn't know better, or just very proud of her BJ's? I'll never know.",

            "body": "First, to be clear the strength of my objection to calling sugaring prostitution is because that argument is often used to shame and manipulate sugar babies, often to refuse to pay them as agreed, etc.\n\nSecond, your argument ignores legal precedent. The letter of most prostitution laws could apply to almost all sexual relationships at some point. But the law is not applied as you suggest. The general application is that there needs to be an offer of specific sexual acts in return for payment. Sure, police can arrest any of us for anything and we can be prosecuted, but the case will be thrown out quickly if it gets to court. I am not aware of a single precedent of SB/SD being successfully prosecuted for prostitution. Are you?\n\nThird, by limiting your definition to the legal definition, you ignore all the ways in which the behavior of most SBs is very, very different from the behavior of escorts.\n\nEscorts are usually very talented and lovely performers who provide a great service. They are athletes, actors, therapists and entrepreneurs who are unfairly stigmatized by society. So being called an escort should not be shaming, but it often is. Calling something prostitution is pretty much always derogatory, unfortunately.\n\nOf course there are SBs who cross the line. I recently had a brief discussion with a POT who, while we were discussing ppm, wanted to tell me about how good she is at BJ's. As noted above, offering payment in exchange for specific sexual acts is what they prosecute as prostitution. Was she a sting, a SB/escort who didn't know better, or just very proud of her BJ's? I'll never know.",
