I don\u2019t want her to worry about anything so she will know where we are going and about when everything is happening. And most importantly when to show up and the latest possible time she will be on her way back home.\n\nThis isn\u2019t romantic. But it helps in so many ways. She may want to suggest tweaks to the schedule, want to know how to dress, be able to make the most of the rest of her day, be able to relax and know everything is taken care of, etc.\n\nSometimes the answer from her is that she has the whole day free. Sometimes we change plans in the moment. But I love having a plan in place.",

I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not perfect by any means, but I\u2019m still kind of new to this and it\u2019s a work in progress. However, the recurring theme throughout is the desire for a quality connection vs \u201chmu when yer horny.\u201d\n\nHis profile was pretty vague, generic sentence or two, had to ask for a pic. I tend to lean toward giving the benefit of the doubt given some people just are discrete, new to the site and still trying to feel it out and learn about the lifestyle, etc. He quickly jumped to asking me if I had plans today, and then segued into him wanting to drive up to my city today, so I moved us to text so we could get down to the nitty gritty.\n\nI got the sense he was looking for more of a escort service vs a true SR - that\u2019s where the question regarding time came from (that as others have pointed out, seems like a red flag on my part - I appreciate the feedback, btw). My thought was I could quickly weed him out if his response was along the lines of \u201cwe meet, have sex, I go back home.\u201d\n\nAs mentioned in a comment - in retrospect, I definitely wasted my time with my response. I was feelin a lil triggered for sure \ud83e\udd23\n\n**\\*\\*Edited to add, the preceding conversation was as follows:**\n\n*Him: \"Hi! It's \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\"*   \nMe: \"Hey there! Thanks for texting - I have to be careful about what is said on SA because it often gets falsely flagged for solicitation.\"   \n*Him: \"No worries.\"*  \nMe: \"So, can you tell me what you are looking for?\"  \nMe: \"Do you have experience with sugar dynamics?\"",

There's  nothing wrong  with a few preliminary questions to get to know someone and see how the conversation (albeit via text) goes because most of those chats fizzle out anyway.  Each step of the process, initial messaging, texting, vid calls, m&g, etc act as filters.  To just do away with a filter means you're going to waste more time further along by taking on m&gs with people who never  should have made it that far.\n\nThe whole point of being efficient here is to not waste time with people who aren't going to work out.  It's part of why I try to get the money conversation taken care of early on.  If we can't make the money part work there's no point in wasting  time on any of the rest of it.  Same with what you're  doing here.  If you don't have enough commonality then why would you waste time getting dressed, making your way to a m&g and spending your time there.   You're asking very basic questions there too.   I mean if someone can't or won't share even a basic overview of how they want to spend time with you, be it dinners, trips or just intimacy between the sheets, then how can  you possibly know you're aligned?\n\nSo yeah, I think if an SB went way overboard on being protective with the time to the point in which it felt like I was being catfished then that would be a problem, but that's  not what I see here.   I don't think you did anything wrong judging by the text you shared and I would expect a girl to ask me questions like that and to answer them were I to pose them as its a natural part of the getting to know you phase.",

And I think sometimes I get caught up in the idea that I need to set a precedent with these guys that they are not thinking with empathy from a SBs perspective - though when thinking logically, its highly unlikely that they would change their behavior based on my opinion/words anyway.\n\nThe closing response has also been perhaps a bit of a way for me to get my feelings out and help me get over it - a quick \"journal entry\" of self-validation, especially as someone who is newer to this lifestyle (lacking confidence with the skills) and trying to learn the right ways of doing things.",
