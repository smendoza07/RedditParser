We know Kwang Soo is perhaps the most loyal member when the camera's off, and at the height of rivalries in the show, Kim Jong Kook was basically looking after Kwang Soo and helping him get stronger off camera. So what they show us on screen is a show. And yet, this episode felt very real.\n\nThey'd joke from time to time about when people thought about leaving, and Jae Suk teases Suk Jin about it to this day, but each of them talked about their insecurities that episode and how they'd leaned on each other for support. Kind of epitomizes why Running Man has felt so inviting and comfortable for so long.",

Even if they weren't friends and close off camera, they're all losing a very giving performing partner.\n\nEveryone on the show has some of their best interactions and jokes when they play off of Kwang Soo. Whether he's playing an apprentice (and betrayer) to YJS, JSJ or KJK, a co-conspirator with Ha Ha, teasing SJH and JSM, or being teased by YJS or YSC, he's kind of the default person to go to for a reaction.\n\nI think more attention will shift to JSJ and JSM for that moving forward, since both already do a lot of that, and maybe someone else will surprise us, but the PD and cast have their work cut out for them now. A lot of games are going to be a lot less chaotic and surprising, and a lot of moments will be a lot more awkward without a perfectly-timed clown moment from Kwang Soo.",

Newer fans who never saw her during the RM hay day are always criticizing her for not being funny enough or not being talkative. JH was as talkative as so min once and you can see her transition, from the talkative member into a reactive member. Let\u2019s also be honest about one thing, variety shows in Korea is a male dominated field and therefore the forefront of the shows are males. They are expected to get a bigger screen time and dominate the conversation. Women are there to be the \u201ctrying hard\u201d to play with the men. They\u2019re there for the visual and the occasional games between women that ads to the appeal of the show. Women in variety shows are never treated as equal when it comes to physical games. JH made it possible for women in variety shows especially actresses to be active and loose their feminine charms in order to win the games. For these reasons, i believed SJ was hired. She was not an average Korean actress, sure she\u2019s beautiful and charming, but she\u2019s also feisty and tough, she doesn\u2019t act like a girl when she\u2019s cornered, she fights back when she\u2019s hurt. RM fans loved her because of those qualities, she made being a girl in variety show an advantage rather than liability. She has the advantage of being seen as weak, therefore not a real competition for men who are not only sexists but also a bully. Fans now a days thinks that the casts should either have more active games or get replaced by new members. They have ideas who they want to see, but often forget that the reason they are able to watch RM now after all these years is because of the original casts and the staff\u2019s hard work. Each and everyone of them made it possible to reach 11yrs. The original casts worked hard for 7 yrs thru ups and downs and to say that SJ or some other member is not helping RM is not only disrespectful but also delusional on their part. Without the original 7 or even Jong Ki, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to watch their 11th year anniversary.",

Even if they weren't friends and close off camera, they're all losing a very giving performing partner.\n\nEveryone on the show has some of their best interactions and jokes when they play off of Kwang Soo. Whether he's playing an apprentice (and betrayer) to YJS, JSJ or KJK, a co-conspirator with Ha Ha, teasing SJH and JSM, or being teased by YJS or YSC, he's kind of the default person to go to for a reaction.\n\nI think more attention will shift to JSJ and JSM for that moving forward, since both already do a lot of that, and maybe someone else will surprise us, but the PD and cast have their work cut out for them now. A lot of games are going to be a lot less chaotic and surprising, and a lot of moments will be a lot more awkward without a perfectly-timed clown moment from Kwang Soo.",
