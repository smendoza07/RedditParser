    "body": "Omg I just had the best M&G I\u2019ve ever had. So we met originally for drinks at Starbucks at the mall nearby. I was wearing skinny jeans and he asked what I was doing in jeans in this heat, when I replied that I didn\u2019t have any shorts that fit me anymore (having a baby changed my body drastically) he said he simply had to fix that! I got two jean shorts that are super comfy and cute. After shopping and having a drink I just felt so instantly comfortable with him that when he suggested we continue at a restaurant for an early dinner I had to agree. \n\nI\u2019m a very cautious person in general but he just kept me 100% at ease and relaxed and talking to him just came so naturally unlike anyone else I\u2019ve ever been on a date with. He asked me to suggest a payment and when I did he actually raised my suggestion. \n\nWe had an amazing dinner and he got me a dessert to bring home to share with my son. I don\u2019t expect any payment during a M&G obviously but he gave me 80 anyways and said he had an amazing time and would love to see me again!!",
