Blow dry it forward with your fingers directing the hair. Then when its completely dry(and before you put any other product on it, except for maybe heat protectant) begin by taking 1-2 inch little section and and use the iron to slightly bend the sections to give it that wave. Do this all over your head. Then lightly run some dry wax through. voila!",

After u do that, I like to put a little shine in my hair so i use a shiny wax / cream to just lightly brush parts of my hair with my fingers. It's not easy and some days it takes me twice as long to do my hair cuz i messed up.",
