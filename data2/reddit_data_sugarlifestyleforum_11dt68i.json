    "body": "Editing to add a bit of a foreword: After commenting [on a recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/11die3k/everything_i_learned_from_being_an_sd_on_sa_for_1/), I realized that most of the advice I would give to new SBs have to do with attitude and self-care. There is plenty of practical guidance already available here. And I think most SBs know the below already. But sometimes it's good to have a reminder.\n\n\\----\n\nIn the 12 years that I have been on SA, I have had huge loves, tremendous heartbreak, beautiful friendships, and an undying gratitude for those who came into my life for the better.\n\nHere are some things I've learned during that time.\n\n**First and foremost, only** ***you*** **can decide what will be right for** ***you***\n\nIt's great to get reality checks from the internet if something isn't sitting well with you, or bouncing ideas off friends to figure out if something is a good idea. But ultimately, your life is your own choose-your-adventure and we don't have to live with the consequences of your actions. You are the only person who will do that. Your opinion matters most.\n\n**Lead with generosity, kindness, and optimism**\n\nYou get out of the world what you put in. If you lead with cynicism and negativity, that's the energy you will attract. Kindness is not weakness. Optimism does not mean being naive. Assume the best possible intentions first instead of immediately jumping to the worst. Being generous does not mean letting people walk all over you and abuse your boundaries. Which leads me to...\n\n**When people show you who they are, believe them**\n\nYou deserve to be treated with respect and appreciation. Trust actions, not words. Do not accept verbal apologies when their behaviors do not change.\n\n**Be liberal with the block button**\n\nIt's easy to be dragged down by other people's negativity. It doesn't benefit you; you don't need it in your life. Don't engage with obvious scammers. Don't interact with people who are after something wholly different than you. Don't waste your time explaining why someone else is wrong. Just be okay knowing that what you want is what you want, and what they want is what they want. Don't let strangers live rent free in your mind.\n\n**Be honest with yourself and others**\n\nDon't force yourself into a situation that \"should\" be good on paper but that you're not into. It's not worth it. My personal advice would be to not do anything you wouldn't do for free, but I hesitate to put that in bold only because I know that to some this is not a realistic expectation. It's okay that not everyone is monetizing their older man fetish like me. It's okay if you find someone's personality attractive but not necessarily are super hot and bothered by their body. But it's not okay if you're going to feel bad about yourself afterward. You have to be okay with you. Your self-love is the most important love.\n\n**Take time for yourself and check in with yourself often**\n\nThis is basically the same as above, but really, seriously, if you only take one thing from this post, my fellow SBs... Make sure you are ok. Put on your own oxygen mask first. You can't be someone else's fantasy and also your own worst nightmare.\n\n**That's it. That's the post.** There is fantastic advice on specifics of finding a SD in the wiki and elsewhere, but these are the core foundations that have helped me over the years. Although they are relatively simple, I hope they help you as well.",

But the point I think we're both making is this: **No one is suggesting SBs should forgo an allowance. And further, no one is suggesting taking an allowance that doesn't provide you with some substantial benefit. But \"more allowance\" or the \"better allowance\" isn't an offset to a situation you wouldn't voluntarily enter into.** So do keep that in mind ladies. it's so true what u/HarvardLawSB says\n\n>You have to be okay with you.

I have had two SBs whe have played consistently important roles in my post-divorce life for at least a year or more. Funny enough, though both veered toward that GF-BF, this is a real relationship, end of the SR spectrum (and ofc not real like out in the open, meet the family), these two approached our SR like mirror opposites. The physical closeness and acceptance of one when the other chose to spend way more time together though not as \u201cclose\u201d, for instance.  In neither case would it end because I just let the relationship drift away, since I value these women so highly. \n\nBut my main point is that as much as I would like to \u201chold them tight\u201d, my interpretation of that phrase just doesn\u2019t accord with what I see as the vast majority of SRs. These can end at any moment for reasons galore. A certain detachment, knowing there\u2019s an expiration, can ironically lead to a strong connection, but a great SR is still, at best, a \u201ctemporary commitment\u201d. I always read that the best way to extinguish the connection, particularly with a large age gap, is to be possessive, jealous, or \u201cclingy\u201d.   There are many ways to be \u201ctight\u201d I guess, and best to be mindful of which work and which risk not.",

            "body": "@OCbird22  @HavardLawSB \nAnother SD opinion on your \u201chold them tight\u201d. I have had two SBs whe have played consistently important roles in my post-divorce life for at least a year or more. Funny enough, though both veered toward that GF-BF, this is a real relationship, end of the SR spectrum (and ofc not real like out in the open, meet the family), these two approached our SR like mirror opposites. The physical closeness and acceptance of one when the other chose to spend way more time together though not as \u201cclose\u201d, for instance.  In neither case would it end because I just let the relationship drift away, since I value these women so highly. \n\nBut my main point is that as much as I would like to \u201chold them tight\u201d, my interpretation of that phrase just doesn\u2019t accord with what I see as the vast majority of SRs. These can end at any moment for reasons galore. A certain detachment, knowing there\u2019s an expiration, can ironically lead to a strong connection, but a great SR is still, at best, a \u201ctemporary commitment\u201d. I always read that the best way to extinguish the connection, particularly with a large age gap, is to be possessive, jealous, or \u201cclingy\u201d.   There are many ways to be \u201ctight\u201d I guess, and best to be mindful of which work and which risk not.",
