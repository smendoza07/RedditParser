The Sharingan gives some of the BEST eyesight in the verse.\n\nThe copying and movement mimicry are all because the Sharingan boosts your eyesight so much that you can see every single muscle movement that happens to your opponent.\n\nIt's how Kakashi looked like a [psychic in his fight against Zabuza](https://youtu.be/uKtLZzEtoNw?t=112).\n\nObito saw through the skin contact jutsu Danzo's henchmen used at the Kage summit because his [Sharingan could literally see the nano sized venom beetles](https://youtu.be/LyEvHvJVHPg?t=126) he was using.\n\nThat's microscope level eyesight while being several feet away.

If the Mangekyou deteriorated one\u2019s sight, but the sharingan makes it so you have more visual clarity anyway, wouldn\u2019t that basically cancel out? If so, then how is Itachi still nearly blind in his fight with Sasuke even with his Sharingan active? Unless that\u2019s a metaphor or Itachi deactivated his Sharingan mid fight when we get his perspective. But the alternative: that the Sharingan only sees chakra without actually enhancing eyesight, while it does work with the Zabuza example (chakra flows before the seals are made), does NOT work with Deidara because even if the nano beetles are made of chakra or have/use it, they are still fucking TINY. \n\nInconsistent writing/anime canon is probably to blame.",

I'm not sure we know that Himawari and Boruto don't have enhanced chakra reserves though. Himawari inherited more Hyuga genes anyways.\n\nI would argue the Sharingan is a rather important aspect of the Uchiha clan. Shinobi clans are unique due to their kekkei genkai, hiden, and/or other unique features. Sure, the Uchiha name could exist without Sharingan, but they'd no longer be the traditional Uchiha clan of the past. Their unique traits and culture really was wiped out, and a new Uchiha clan would really need to develop a new unifying identity beyond a surname. At that point, they're no different from the other random shinobi without a defined clan or culture such as Iruka.",

If the Mangekyou deteriorated one\u2019s sight, but the sharingan makes it so you have more visual clarity anyway, wouldn\u2019t that basically cancel out? If so, then how is Itachi still nearly blind in his fight with Sasuke even with his Sharingan active? Unless that\u2019s a metaphor or Itachi deactivated his Sharingan mid fight when we get his perspective. But the alternative: that the Sharingan only sees chakra without actually enhancing eyesight, while it does work with the Zabuza example (chakra flows before the seals are made), does NOT work with Deidara because even if the nano beetles are made of chakra or have/use it, they are still fucking TINY. \n\nInconsistent writing/anime canon is probably to blame.",

I'm not sure we know that Himawari and Boruto don't have enhanced chakra reserves though. Himawari inherited more Hyuga genes anyways.\n\nI would argue the Sharingan is a rather important aspect of the Uchiha clan. Shinobi clans are unique due to their kekkei genkai, hiden, and/or other unique features. Sure, the Uchiha name could exist without Sharingan, but they'd no longer be the traditional Uchiha clan of the past. Their unique traits and culture really was wiped out, and a new Uchiha clan would really need to develop a new unifying identity beyond a surname. At that point, they're no different from the other random shinobi without a defined clan or culture such as Iruka.",

The Sharingan gives some of the BEST eyesight in the verse.\n\nThe copying and movement mimicry are all because the Sharingan boosts your eyesight so much that you can see every single muscle movement that happens to your opponent.\n\nIt's how Kakashi looked like a [psychic in his fight against Zabuza](https://youtu.be/uKtLZzEtoNw?t=112).\n\nObito saw through the skin contact jutsu Danzo's henchmen used at the Kage summit because his [Sharingan could literally see the nano sized venom beetles](https://youtu.be/LyEvHvJVHPg?t=126) he was using.\n\nThat's microscope level eyesight while being several feet away.

If the Mangekyou deteriorated one\u2019s sight, but the sharingan makes it so you have more visual clarity anyway, wouldn\u2019t that basically cancel out? If so, then how is Itachi still nearly blind in his fight with Sasuke even with his Sharingan active? Unless that\u2019s a metaphor or Itachi deactivated his Sharingan mid fight when we get his perspective. But the alternative: that the Sharingan only sees chakra without actually enhancing eyesight, while it does work with the Zabuza example (chakra flows before the seals are made), does NOT work with Deidara because even if the nano beetles are made of chakra or have/use it, they are still fucking TINY. \n\nInconsistent writing/anime canon is probably to blame.",

I'm not sure we know that Himawari and Boruto don't have enhanced chakra reserves though. Himawari inherited more Hyuga genes anyways.\n\nI would argue the Sharingan is a rather important aspect of the Uchiha clan. Shinobi clans are unique due to their kekkei genkai, hiden, and/or other unique features. Sure, the Uchiha name could exist without Sharingan, but they'd no longer be the traditional Uchiha clan of the past. Their unique traits and culture really was wiped out, and a new Uchiha clan would really need to develop a new unifying identity beyond a surname. At that point, they're no different from the other random shinobi without a defined clan or culture such as Iruka.",

The Sharingan gives some of the BEST eyesight in the verse.\n\nThe copying and movement mimicry are all because the Sharingan boosts your eyesight so much that you can see every single muscle movement that happens to your opponent.\n\nIt's how Kakashi looked like a [psychic in his fight against Zabuza](https://youtu.be/uKtLZzEtoNw?t=112).\n\nObito saw through the skin contact jutsu Danzo's henchmen used at the Kage summit because his [Sharingan could literally see the nano sized venom beetles](https://youtu.be/LyEvHvJVHPg?t=126) he was using.\n\nThat's microscope level eyesight while being several feet away. Your source might have forgotten a couple things or two that happened in the series showing how the Sharingan definitively provides god tier vision.",

If the Mangekyou deteriorated one\u2019s sight, but the sharingan makes it so you have more visual clarity anyway, wouldn\u2019t that basically cancel out? If so, then how is Itachi still nearly blind in his fight with Sasuke even with his Sharingan active? Unless that\u2019s a metaphor or Itachi deactivated his Sharingan mid fight when we get his perspective. But the alternative: that the Sharingan only sees chakra without actually enhancing eyesight, while it does work with the Zabuza example (chakra flows before the seals are made), does NOT work with Deidara because even if the nano beetles are made of chakra or have/use it, they are still fucking TINY. \n\nInconsistent writing/anime canon is probably to blame.",
