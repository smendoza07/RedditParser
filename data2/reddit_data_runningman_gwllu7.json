It\u2019s more so because it\u2019s backed up by her signature medium-sounding voice and atmosphere.\u201d \n\n\u201cThis movie was expected to be released in March, but it was postponed twice due to Corona. Both Song Jihyo and Kim Moo-Yeol were great but I was especially inspired by Song Jihyos acting scenes. If you think of the nice Song Jihyo who plays in running man it\u2019s a big mistake!

It\u2019s more so because it\u2019s backed up by her signature medium-sounding voice and atmosphere.\u201d \n\n\u201cThis movie was expected to be released in March, but it was postponed twice due to Corona. Both Song Jihyo and Kim Moo-Yeol were great but I was especially inspired by Song Jihyos acting scenes. If you think of the nice Song Jihyo who plays in running man it\u2019s a big mistake!
