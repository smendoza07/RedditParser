Highly recommend Aussie Miracle Moist for your type of hair, as I used to have the same.\n\n3. Wrap hair in a t-shirt for one minute right out of the shower. This will trap moisture and again, give your hair more substance. Avoid towel drying hair whenever possible.\n\n4. After hair gains more life through previous steps, start applying Cantu curl cream just after t-shirt drying to define curls.\n\nUse these 4 tips and I promise your hair will take on a new being. Take care and good luck!\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention, IMHO you don\u2019t need a cut just yet, current length is the sweet spot, especially after some care.",

You can usually get it at any drug store or grocery store. It's cheapest at Walmart ($9 a bottle at Walmart vs $14 a bottle at Shoppers). It took me years to find a good set up and this is what works for my hair. Condition every day in the shower and shampoo every other day or so depending on how fast your hair gets greasy. Make sure you rinse it out really well in between shampoo and conditioner and after conditioner. If you can use cold water to rinse the conditioner even better. I'm not sure about the t shirt method mentioned below. What i usually do it kind of shake like a dog to get most of the water out of my hair, then put my hands in my hair with my fingers apart and shake them to sort of free it up from being too dense, I usually squeeze it with a towel a bit too. It won't be dry immediately but it's important to let it air dry a bit before you go look on the mirror and try to style it or anything.",

You can usually get it at any drug store or grocery store. It's cheapest at Walmart ($9 a bottle at Walmart vs $14 a bottle at Shoppers). It took me years to find a good set up and this is what works for my hair. Condition every day in the shower and shampoo every other day or so depending on how fast your hair gets greasy. Make sure you rinse it out really well in between shampoo and conditioner and after conditioner. If you can use cold water to rinse the conditioner even better. I'm not sure about the t shirt method mentioned below. What i usually do it kind of shake like a dog to get most of the water out of my hair, then put my hands in my hair with my fingers apart and shake them to sort of free it up from being too dense, I usually squeeze it with a towel a bit too. It won't be dry immediately but it's important to let it air dry a bit before you go look on the mirror and try to style it or anything.",
