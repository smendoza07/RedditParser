    "body": "Yoo Jae-suk's quick and wise response prevented the crisis from spreading in the entertainment industry.\n\nIt is known that broadcaster Yoo Jae-suk was diagnosed with Covid-19, and his careful handling prevented the spread.\n\nOn the 13th, Yoo Jae-suk's agency, Antenna Entertainment, announced that Yoo Jae-suk tested positive for COVID-19. Earlier on the 10th, Antenna's head Yoo Hee-yeol was diagnosed with the virus. According to the agency, Yoo Jae-suk had completed the second dose of the vaccine at the end of September, and on the 11th, after receiving notification of close contact with the confirmed person, he immediately performed a PCR  test and tested negative.\n\nYoo Jae-suk, who tested negative, was switched to passive monitoring rather than self-quarantine, but for fear of the spread of COVID-19, he avoided outside activities and contact with outsiders as much as possible on his own, and checked the situation with a self-diagnosis kit from time to time.\n\nIn the process, he was scheduled to attend the wedding of Lee Ye-rim, daughter of Lee Kyung-gyu, a broadcaster, and Kim Young-chan, a soccer player, on the 11th, but Yoo Jae-suk asked for his understanding in advance and stayed at home. Yoo Jae-suk, who arrived at the filming site ahead of the SBS 'Running Man' shooting schedule on the 13th, waited in the car and conducted a self-diagnostic kit test first in case of unforeseen circumstances. As a result, when suspicious symptoms appeared, a PCR test was performed immediately, and the diagnosis was confirmed on the same day.\n\nYoo Jae-suk's careful treatment prevented the large-scale spread of COVID-19. About 100 guests, including many celebrities, attended Lee Kyung-gyu's daughter's wedding, which could have caused an emergency in the industry due to a group infection. Also, by avoiding face-to-face contact with the cast and crew of 'Running Man' without getting out of the car, the 'red light' was avoided throughout the program.\n\nWhen the process was revealed until he was confirmed, netizens continued to praise Yoo Jae-suk's calm and cautious response, saying, \"As expected, God Yoo.\" It is an opinion that as a \"national MC\", he showed the most exemplary steps related to quarantine. Fortunately, as of 5 p.m. on the 14th, there have been no additional confirmed cases related to Yoo Jae-suk. Yoo Jae-suk is currently canceling all scheduled schedules and taking self-quarantine and necessary measures according to the guidelines of the quarantine authorities.\n\n[https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=417&aid=0000764563](https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=417&aid=0000764563)\n\n[https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=629&aid=0000121652](https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=629&aid=0000121652)\n\nEdit: Format",

No. Did he make some people's lives better by making the choices he did? Absolutely. You can let the man get some kudos for that lmao",

But the fact is that many normal people do not do the right thing. They put too much trust in test results. They believe they are invincible. They focus only on their work and not others. \n\nDoes YJS deserve all the hype about being some sort of angel from heaven? Nope. But did he do the right thing? Yes.
