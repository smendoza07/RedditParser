It's just only one takes care of management. If you become hokage, you are automatically ranked up.\n\nIt's like if someone becomes an Admiral directly from Commander and then yall calling him Commander cuz he skipped the rank of Captain.\n\n\nEdit : since a lot of folks are downvoting me for saying minato and hiruzen were both Kages at the same time, from naruto wiki:\n\n[https://xnaruto1.fandom.com/wiki/Naruto_Ninja_Ranks](https://xnaruto1.fandom.com/wiki/Naruto_Ninja_Ranks)\n\n*as a ninja may be the most powerful at the time of being installed as Kage, but may become less powerful upon aging, eventually being surpassed by a younger ninja. A Kage may retire and give the title to someone else; however, once granted, the title is held permanently, creating a situation where a village has two Kage at the same time, with only one of them actually active*\n\nThis is what happened with them. Hiruzen retired from active Kage but still his ninja rank was Kage while minato was active Kage. Once he died, Hiruzen was reinstated as active Kage.\n\nThis is also true for later when Naruto was active hokage, Kakashi was still Kage.",

They've been shown to contradict canon many times.\n\nSecondly, this doesn't address the fact that we are very explicitly told that Hiruzen is too old and doesn't feel he should be Hokage anymore and steps down for Minato to take his place. The hokage is not just a normal rank, you can't have multiple ninja be Hokage, it's a position that only one person can fill at a time. Like this is just a fact, like hiruzen isn't wearing the hokage robe when the nine tails attacks the village and Minato makes a big show of doing specifically that. Were also told they had to ask hiruzen to retake the mantle. Like seriously you didn't pay attention if you thought multiple people can be Hokage at once. \n\nThen on top of this, hokage is a special rank, it's not like Jonin, chunin or genin. It's seperate, that graphic of chapter 9 is Kakashi explaining the mission system to a young Naruto and hokage is where it is to show that the hokage is the most capable ninja in the village. We see Naruto in the boruto manga tell Kawaki that he is still a genin. He never got promoted. Being hokage doesn't automatically mean he's been promoted past Jonin, but when you're hokage that ranking system doesn't even really apply. You're hokage because you're the strongest ninja, you don't need those ranks to classify you.\n\nTo conclude, Naruto is a genin and hokage and there can only be one hokage at a time.",

And if hokage is special rank according    to you that somehow explanation from chapter 9 doesn't apply to then show me scan of manga where it's clearly stated that Hokage isn't rank. Because for now you just presented your headcanon on your assumptions. And even with your logic Naruto while acting as Hokage has Hokage rank, he would only lose it after he would retire. And Naruto never told Kawaki that he is genin. In introduction he told Kawaki that he is Hokage, not genin.",

Like why isn't it in that infographic in chapter 9??? Huh??? Like fuck man. Kakashi literally is telling you, the reader, that these ranks signify different groups og strength and you still don't understand how positions like hokage, Jonin commander, special Jonin, etc fit in to those general groupings. \n\nThe hokage is the strongest ninja and is the leader on the council with the two elders and danzo, but it ultimately in charge, answering only to the fire daimo. The Jonin commander is an exemplary strategic leader in charge of the Jonin, despite the name, you could technically have a genin become Jonin commander like Naruto became hokage despite being genin. Both retain their previous rank of genin. You've got special Jonin which are ninja not strong enough in all areas to be a full Jonin, but excel in one area to Jonin level. It's actually unclear if this actually removes your previous rank, but I imagine all the special Jonin where chunin before being made special Jonin. \n\nThen you've got the normal progression of every ninja. You're an academy student, until you graduate and are promoted to genin. You remain a genin until you take the chunin exams where you have a chance to showcase your skills and be promoted to Chunin. Then as a chunin, you can be nominated to become Jonin, which will be considered by the hokage. \n\nNaruto failed every chunin exam he attended and was thus never promoted to Chunin. After the war Naruto just never bothers doing the chunin exams again and remains a genin until Kakashi hands over the position to Naruto. Naruto never got promoted from genin.",

In the past there wasn't such possibility since next Kage was promoted after the previous one died. I think the good analogy is current situation with the Popes.

A couple of individuals *happen* to be godlike in a particular timeframe in the history of narutoverse. That doesn't mean being Hokage is a different level.  \n\n\nThe whole reason everyone thinks is because of Hashirama/tobirama/hiruzen and minato. They just happened to be kage Ranked Ninjas who are gifted.   \n\n\nFor example, if the US Navy has 3 4 Admirals who are exceptionally great, thats just coincidence. doesn't mean that US Admiral in general is a superior thing compared to other army Admirals  nor it means that other US Admirals who succeed that 3 4 exceptional admiral are any different than those admiral(In terms of rank)  \n\n\nin short, Being a hokage automatically doesn't make you better than other kage. There is obviously an individual aspect to it (i.e) one kage is better than others etc\n\nIf you think about it, we can't really separate like that. if that's the case, then Madara is godlike. Im pretty sure during his time he was stronger than any shinobi in the world except hashirama. but he was never a Hokage.  So is jiraya and ooruchimaru for their generation. If you think about it, post war arc Sasuke is Demi-god. He is still not a Hokage. Killer B was stronger than Aay in pre-war arc. But he was not a raikage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Hokage is just a rank it has nothing to do with the skill level. in Narutoverse, all Kage's(one who officially got the rank) are Hokages if they are from leaf village.  \n\n\nBut i do agree ur argument that all Hokage's are usually powerful than any other Kage's in the world but thats just coincidence and should be taken in individual level not a rank level",

Shikamaru was the only one who passed Chunin exam because everyone thought that with his wit he has the potential to be a Kage one day. Yeah most Kages are prodigys but you guys are not giving enough credit for Sakura. By the end of fourth ninja war she was stronger than tsunade both physically and in medical jutsu. And tsunade healed up an entire village with her jutsu. Not to mention she has hashiramas healing cells. If Sakura is stronger than her, thats definetly worth Kage level.\n\nAlso comparing people to Kages of hidden leaf its not fair. Hashirama is God, tobirama, hiruzen and minato are like Newton, einstien and Stephen hawking's of ninja world, they are special even for Kages. Sakura Is definitely stronger than Kakashi and tsunade.",

But in terms of raw strength Sakura is stronger than kakashi. a deathmatch is not a good metric for anything in naruto because it depends on a lot of things like anticipating your enemy moves, compatibility of your chakra element vs your enemy, the terrain you fight etc.\n\nAlthough, I truly believe that kakashi would only win because of his experience. Even with his Sharingan, Sakura have the advantage of healing herself until he runs out of chakra(his chakra has a draining disadvantage due to always on sharingan). it wont be an easy fight for her but the probability of winning is not 0.  \n\n\nas for chidori, The Creation Rebirth jutsu can keep you undamaged until you run out of chakra. so i think she can take a chidori or two before she gets fucked up.",

How could she ever be?\n\njust because someone is not born in a specific OP family doesn't mean they can't become strong. Hiruzen has no such lineage. The Sarutobi clan fought the clan wars but they were no special but Hiruzen trained his ass to become one of the only two ninjas to master all chakra element without any powerups like sage mode or Kekkai Genkai.Sakura mastered Byakugo at the age of 17 which is considered The pinnacle of Chakra control. The only other confirmed user is Tsunade herself. Mito had the rhombus in her forehead but it was never confirmed she is a user. she also mastered Creation Rebirth which is S class technique. She is one of the only two Medical Ninja who is allowed to fight in the frontline. She's stronger than all kunoichis of her generation(including other villages).\n\nCreation rebirth is a rare technique, it literally accelerates your body's cell division thus healing any damage you get. combining it with the 100 seals, you are literally in Hashirama territory(although only till you run out of chakra). Tsunade healed herself as if its nothing after taking a big slash from Madara's Susano. Mastering that technique is God like chakra control in entire narutoverse.\n\nWith physical strength, she's powerful than most Jonins. in the second training fight with Kakashi and naruto where kakashi shows off his hand sign skills, he says mutlple times, that if he manage to take one of her punches he's done for and avoided  touching her at all times.",

Tsunade was one of the legendary Sannin who helped end the 3rd great ninja war and Kakashi's name was feared throughout the world since he was a child. \n\nSakura heals people which is great, but that doesn't equate to strength. Great utility, no doubt, but she's just not on the same power level as the others. \n\nShe's probably closest to Tsunade but even then... Tsunade's strength was enough to crack Madara's susanoo... and this was MUCH past her prime. I think she was around 60 during the war arc?",

Genin, Chunin, Jonin and Kage. if you are Kage (i.e) when you are officially given the Kage rank you become Either Hokage, Kazekage, Mizukage, Raikage or Tsuchikage depending on which village you get that rank. The prefix just represent which village you belong to, ex Hokage -> Fire shadow(cuz land of fire), Mizukage-> Water shadow(cuz land of rain) etc.   \n\n\nAlthough not officially given the rank there are plenty of kage level ninjas in Hidden leaf. Madara, Itachi, Sishui, Sasuke, Ooruchimaru, Jiraya, Gai all of them are Kage level but have not given the official Rank. doesn't mean they are less level than Hokage. Also it depends on political aspects too. Kage has administrative task and the Rank is given based on the current Kage's opinion too. For example Danzo is equally skilled as Hiruzen but Tobirama chose Hiruzen.  \n\n\nits like in a military some people prefer to be in field as Captain rather than to sit behind a desk as Admiral. Doesn't mean they are any less than an Admiral in terms of skill.",

She's literally the leader of Konoha's Intel divisions and the Yamanaka clan. How in the world can she lead them without having the proper rank? Same goes for Choji. Head of the Akimichi clan and still Chunin? Nah, I don't believe it. \n\nShino is an interesting case because he's deliberately denying promotion for Jonin due to his work at the academy(whilst also presumably being head of the Aburame clan). Kiba and Tenten are the iffy ones to be honest. Tenten has the intelligence to achieve the rank, but probably lacks the power needed as well. Kiba on the otherhand is the reverse. Has the power, but lacks the brains. Although doesn't make too much sense since Lee is Jonin.\n\n Hinata's case is more obvious. She pretty much retired from ninja life during the Last era. She could have achieved the rank at some point before conceiving Boruto. Basically all of them should be Jonin besides Hinata and Shino because of personal choices.",

Lol While it wasn't the smartest play, it makes sense why she did it. Sai telling her that it was her fault that Naruto was doing all this is the real reason that she wanted him to stop. I also believe that she did love him at that point too, just not full on romantic. There were hints that she liked him even at the start of Shippuden, but this is when all of that ended.\n\nShe didn't want Naruto to go through any more of this shit because of her, and in her head, it made sense. Is it well written? No. Kishimoto is pretty bad at this kind of stuff, tbh, but it makes sense to anyone who isn't dead set on hating Sakura for no real reason.\n\nMy biggest problem with romance in Naruto is that nobody actually dates. Lmao they pick someone they like as a kid and end up married, unless they are Choji. Lol",

It's just only one takes care of management. If you become hokage, you are automatically ranked up.\n\nIt's like if someone becomes an Admiral directly from Commander and then yall calling him Commander cuz he skipped the rank of Captain.\n\n\nEdit : since a lot of folks are downvoting me for saying minato and hiruzen were both Kages at the same time, from naruto wiki:\n\n[https://xnaruto1.fandom.com/wiki/Naruto_Ninja_Ranks](https://xnaruto1.fandom.com/wiki/Naruto_Ninja_Ranks)\n\n*as a ninja may be the most powerful at the time of being installed as Kage, but may become less powerful upon aging, eventually being surpassed by a younger ninja. A Kage may retire and give the title to someone else; however, once granted, the title is held permanently, creating a situation where a village has two Kage at the same time, with only one of them actually active*\n\nThis is what happened with them. Hiruzen retired from active Kage but still his ninja rank was Kage while minato was active Kage. Once he died, Hiruzen was reinstated as active Kage.\n\nThis is also true for later when Naruto was active hokage, Kakashi was still Kage.",

They've been shown to contradict canon many times.\n\nSecondly, this doesn't address the fact that we are very explicitly told that Hiruzen is too old and doesn't feel he should be Hokage anymore and steps down for Minato to take his place. The hokage is not just a normal rank, you can't have multiple ninja be Hokage, it's a position that only one person can fill at a time. Like this is just a fact, like hiruzen isn't wearing the hokage robe when the nine tails attacks the village and Minato makes a big show of doing specifically that. Were also told they had to ask hiruzen to retake the mantle. Like seriously you didn't pay attention if you thought multiple people can be Hokage at once. \n\nThen on top of this, hokage is a special rank, it's not like Jonin, chunin or genin. It's seperate, that graphic of chapter 9 is Kakashi explaining the mission system to a young Naruto and hokage is where it is to show that the hokage is the most capable ninja in the village. We see Naruto in the boruto manga tell Kawaki that he is still a genin. He never got promoted. Being hokage doesn't automatically mean he's been promoted past Jonin, but when you're hokage that ranking system doesn't even really apply. You're hokage because you're the strongest ninja, you don't need those ranks to classify you.\n\nTo conclude, Naruto is a genin and hokage and there can only be one hokage at a time.",

Because for now you just presented your headcanon on your assumptions. And even with your logic Naruto while acting as Hokage has Hokage rank, he would only lose it after he would retire.

Huh??? Like fuck man. Kakashi literally is telling you, the reader, that these ranks signify different groups og strength and you still don't understand how positions like hokage, Jonin commander, special Jonin, etc fit in to those general groupings. \n\nThe hokage is the strongest ninja and is the leader on the council with the two elders and danzo, but it ultimately in charge, answering only to the fire daimo. The Jonin commander is an exemplary strategic leader in charge of the Jonin, despite the name, you could technically have a genin become Jonin commander like Naruto became hokage despite being genin. Both retain their previous rank of genin. You've got special Jonin which are ninja not strong enough in all areas to be a full Jonin, but excel in one area to Jonin level. It's actually unclear if this actually removes your previous rank, but I imagine all the special Jonin where chunin before being made special Jonin. \n\nThen you've got the normal progression of every ninja. You're an academy student, until you graduate and are promoted to genin. You remain a genin until you take the chunin exams where you have a chance to showcase your skills and be promoted to Chunin. Then as a chunin, you can be nominated to become Jonin, which will be considered by the hokage. \n\nNaruto failed every chunin exam he attended and was thus never promoted to Chunin. After the war Naruto just never bothers doing the chunin exams again and remains a genin until Kakashi hands over the position to Naruto. Naruto never got promoted from genin.",

A couple of individuals *happen* to be godlike in a particular timeframe in the history of narutoverse. That doesn't mean being Hokage is a different level.  \n\n\nThe whole reason everyone thinks is because of Hashirama/tobirama/hiruzen and minato. They just happened to be kage Ranked Ninjas who are gifted.   \n\n\nFor example, if the US Navy has 3 4 Admirals who are exceptionally great, thats just coincidence. doesn't mean that US Admiral in general is a superior thing compared to other army Admirals  nor it means that other US Admirals who succeed that 3 4 exceptional admiral are any different than those admiral(In terms of rank)  \n\n\nin short, Being a hokage automatically doesn't make you better than other kage. There is obviously an individual aspect to it (i.e) one kage is better than others etc\n\nIf you think about it, we can't really separate like that. if that's the case, then Madara is godlike. Im pretty sure during his time he was stronger than any shinobi in the world except hashirama. but he was never a Hokage.  So is jiraya and ooruchimaru for their generation. If you think about it, post war arc Sasuke is Demi-god. He is still not a Hokage. Killer B was stronger than Aay in pre-war arc. But he was not a raikage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Hokage is just a rank it has nothing to do with the skill level. in Narutoverse, all Kage's(one who officially got the rank) are Hokages if they are from leaf village.  \n\n\nBut i do agree ur argument that all Hokage's are usually powerful than any other Kage's in the world but thats just coincidence and should be taken in individual level not a rank level",

Yeah most Kages are prodigys but you guys are not giving enough credit for Sakura. By the end of fourth ninja war she was stronger than tsunade both physically and in medical jutsu. And tsunade healed up an entire village with her jutsu. Not to mention she has hashiramas healing cells. If Sakura is stronger than her, thats definetly worth Kage level.\n\nAlso comparing people to Kages of hidden leaf its not fair. Hashirama is God, tobirama, hiruzen and minato are like Newton, einstien and Stephen hawking's of ninja world, they are special even for Kages. Sakura Is definitely stronger than Kakashi and tsunade.",

But in terms of raw strength Sakura is stronger than kakashi. a deathmatch is not a good metric for anything in naruto because it depends on a lot of things like anticipating your enemy moves, compatibility of your chakra element vs your enemy, the terrain you fight etc.\n\nAlthough, I truly believe that kakashi would only win because of his experience. Even with his Sharingan, Sakura have the advantage of healing herself until he runs out of chakra(his chakra has a draining disadvantage due to always on sharingan). it wont be an easy fight for her but the probability of winning is not 0.  \n\n\nas for chidori, The Creation Rebirth jutsu can keep you undamaged until you run out of chakra. so i think she can take a chidori or two before she gets fucked up.",

How could she ever be?\n\njust because someone is not born in a specific OP family doesn't mean they can't become strong. Hiruzen has no such lineage. The Sarutobi clan fought the clan wars but they were no special but Hiruzen trained his ass to become one of the only two ninjas to master all chakra element without any powerups like sage mode or Kekkai Genkai.Sakura mastered Byakugo at the age of 17 which is considered The pinnacle of Chakra control. The only other confirmed user is Tsunade herself. Mito had the rhombus in her forehead but it was never confirmed she is a user. she also mastered Creation Rebirth which is S class technique. She is one of the only two Medical Ninja who is allowed to fight in the frontline. She's stronger than all kunoichis of her generation(including other villages).\n\nCreation rebirth is a rare technique, it literally accelerates your body's cell division thus healing any damage you get. combining it with the 100 seals, you are literally in Hashirama territory(although only till you run out of chakra). Tsunade healed herself as if its nothing after taking a big slash from Madara's Susano. Mastering that technique is God like chakra control in entire narutoverse.\n\nWith physical strength, she's powerful than most Jonins. in the second training fight with Kakashi and naruto where kakashi shows off his hand sign skills, he says mutlple times, that if he manage to take one of her punches he's done for and avoided  touching her at all times.",

Genin, Chunin, Jonin and Kage. if you are Kage (i.e) when you are officially given the Kage rank you become Either Hokage, Kazekage, Mizukage, Raikage or Tsuchikage depending on which village you get that rank. The prefix just represent which village you belong to, ex Hokage -> Fire shadow(cuz land of fire), Mizukage-> Water shadow(cuz land of rain) etc.   \n\n\nAlthough not officially given the rank there are plenty of kage level ninjas in Hidden leaf. Madara, Itachi, Sishui, Sasuke, Ooruchimaru, Jiraya, Gai all of them are Kage level but have not given the official Rank. doesn't mean they are less level than Hokage. Also it depends on political aspects too. Kage has administrative task and the Rank is given based on the current Kage's opinion too. For example Danzo is equally skilled as Hiruzen but Tobirama chose Hiruzen.  \n\n\nits like in a military some people prefer to be in field as Captain rather than to sit behind a desk as Admiral.

She's literally the leader of Konoha's Intel divisions and the Yamanaka clan. How in the world can she lead them without having the proper rank? Same goes for Choji. Head of the Akimichi clan and still Chunin? Nah, I don't believe it. \n\nShino is an interesting case because he's deliberately denying promotion for Jonin due to his work at the academy(whilst also presumably being head of the Aburame clan). Kiba and Tenten are the iffy ones to be honest. Tenten has the intelligence to achieve the rank, but probably lacks the power needed as well. Kiba on the otherhand is the reverse. Has the power, but lacks the brains. Although doesn't make too much sense since Lee is Jonin.\n\n Hinata's case is more obvious. She pretty much retired from ninja life during the Last era. She could have achieved the rank at some point before conceiving Boruto. Basically all of them should be Jonin besides Hinata and Shino because of personal choices.",

Lol While it wasn't the smartest play, it makes sense why she did it. Sai telling her that it was her fault that Naruto was doing all this is the real reason that she wanted him to stop. I also believe that she did love him at that point too, just not full on romantic. There were hints that she liked him even at the start of Shippuden, but this is when all of that ended.\n\nShe didn't want Naruto to go through any more of this shit because of her, and in her head, it made sense. Is it well written? No. Kishimoto is pretty bad at this kind of stuff, tbh, but it makes sense to anyone who isn't dead set on hating Sakura for no real reason.\n\nMy biggest problem with romance in Naruto is that nobody actually dates. Lmao they pick someone they like as a kid and end up married, unless they are Choji. Lol",

They've been shown to contradict canon many times.\n\nSecondly, this doesn't address the fact that we are very explicitly told that Hiruzen is too old and doesn't feel he should be Hokage anymore and steps down for Minato to take his place. The hokage is not just a normal rank, you can't have multiple ninja be Hokage, it's a position that only one person can fill at a time. Like this is just a fact, like hiruzen isn't wearing the hokage robe when the nine tails attacks the village and Minato makes a big show of doing specifically that. Were also told they had to ask hiruzen to retake the mantle. Like seriously you didn't pay attention if you thought multiple people can be Hokage at once. \n\nThen on top of this, hokage is a special rank, it's not like Jonin, chunin or genin. It's seperate, that graphic of chapter 9 is Kakashi explaining the mission system to a young Naruto and hokage is where it is to show that the hokage is the most capable ninja in the village. We see Naruto in the boruto manga tell Kawaki that he is still a genin. He never got promoted. Being hokage doesn't automatically mean he's been promoted past Jonin, but when you're hokage that ranking system doesn't even really apply. You're hokage because you're the strongest ninja, you don't need those ranks to classify you.\n\nTo conclude, Naruto is a genin and hokage and there can only be one hokage at a time.",

Because for now you just presented your headcanon on your assumptions. And even with your logic Naruto while acting as Hokage has Hokage rank, he would only lose it after he would retire.

Like fuck man. Kakashi literally is telling you, the reader, that these ranks signify different groups og strength and you still don't understand how positions like hokage, Jonin commander, special Jonin, etc fit in to those general groupings. \n\nThe hokage is the strongest ninja and is the leader on the council with the two elders and danzo, but it ultimately in charge, answering only to the fire daimo. The Jonin commander is an exemplary strategic leader in charge of the Jonin, despite the name, you could technically have a genin become Jonin commander like Naruto became hokage despite being genin. Both retain their previous rank of genin. You've got special Jonin which are ninja not strong enough in all areas to be a full Jonin, but excel in one area to Jonin level. It's actually unclear if this actually removes your previous rank, but I imagine all the special Jonin where chunin before being made special Jonin. \n\nThen you've got the normal progression of every ninja. You're an academy student, until you graduate and are promoted to genin. You remain a genin until you take the chunin exams where you have a chance to showcase your skills and be promoted to Chunin. Then as a chunin, you can be nominated to become Jonin, which will be considered by the hokage. \n\nNaruto failed every chunin exam he attended and was thus never promoted to Chunin. After the war Naruto just never bothers doing the chunin exams again and remains a genin until Kakashi hands over the position to Naruto. Naruto never got promoted from genin.",

In the past there wasn't such possibility since next Kage was promoted after the previous one died. I think the good analogy is current situation with the Popes.

A couple of individuals *happen* to be godlike in a particular timeframe in the history of narutoverse. That doesn't mean being Hokage is a different level.  \n\n\nThe whole reason everyone thinks is because of Hashirama/tobirama/hiruzen and minato. They just happened to be kage Ranked Ninjas who are gifted.   \n\n\nFor example, if the US Navy has 3 4 Admirals who are exceptionally great, thats just coincidence. doesn't mean that US Admiral in general is a superior thing compared to other army Admirals  nor it means that other US Admirals who succeed that 3 4 exceptional admiral are any different than those admiral(In terms of rank)  \n\n\nin short, Being a hokage automatically doesn't make you better than other kage. There is obviously an individual aspect to it (i.e) one kage is better than others etc\n\nIf you think about it, we can't really separate like that. if that's the case, then Madara is godlike. Im pretty sure during his time he was stronger than any shinobi in the world except hashirama. but he was never a Hokage.  So is jiraya and ooruchimaru for their generation. If you think about it, post war arc Sasuke is Demi-god. He is still not a Hokage. Killer B was stronger than Aay in pre-war arc. But he was not a raikage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Hokage is just a rank it has nothing to do with the skill level. in Narutoverse, all Kage's(one who officially got the rank) are Hokages if they are from leaf village.  \n\n\nBut i do agree ur argument that all Hokage's are usually powerful than any other Kage's in the world but thats just coincidence and should be taken in individual level not a rank level",

Yeah most Kages are prodigys but you guys are not giving enough credit for Sakura. By the end of fourth ninja war she was stronger than tsunade both physically and in medical jutsu. And tsunade healed up an entire village with her jutsu. Not to mention she has hashiramas healing cells. If Sakura is stronger than her, thats definetly worth Kage level.\n\nAlso comparing people to Kages of hidden leaf its not fair. Hashirama is God, tobirama, hiruzen and minato are like Newton, einstien and Stephen hawking's of ninja world, they are special even for Kages. Sakura Is definitely stronger than Kakashi and tsunade.",

But in terms of raw strength Sakura is stronger than kakashi. a deathmatch is not a good metric for anything in naruto because it depends on a lot of things like anticipating your enemy moves, compatibility of your chakra element vs your enemy, the terrain you fight etc.\n\nAlthough, I truly believe that kakashi would only win because of his experience. Even with his Sharingan, Sakura have the advantage of healing herself until he runs out of chakra(his chakra has a draining disadvantage due to always on sharingan). it wont be an easy fight for her but the probability of winning is not 0.  \n\n\nas for chidori, The Creation Rebirth jutsu can keep you undamaged until you run out of chakra. so i think she can take a chidori or two before she gets fucked up.",

How could she ever be?\n\njust because someone is not born in a specific OP family doesn't mean they can't become strong. Hiruzen has no such lineage. The Sarutobi clan fought the clan wars but they were no special but Hiruzen trained his ass to become one of the only two ninjas to master all chakra element without any powerups like sage mode or Kekkai Genkai.Sakura mastered Byakugo at the age of 17 which is considered The pinnacle of Chakra control. The only other confirmed user is Tsunade herself. Mito had the rhombus in her forehead but it was never confirmed she is a user. she also mastered Creation Rebirth which is S class technique. She is one of the only two Medical Ninja who is allowed to fight in the frontline. She's stronger than all kunoichis of her generation(including other villages).\n\nCreation rebirth is a rare technique, it literally accelerates your body's cell division thus healing any damage you get. combining it with the 100 seals, you are literally in Hashirama territory(although only till you run out of chakra). Tsunade healed herself as if its nothing after taking a big slash from Madara's Susano. Mastering that technique is God like chakra control in entire narutoverse.\n\nWith physical strength, she's powerful than most Jonins. in the second training fight with Kakashi and naruto where kakashi shows off his hand sign skills, he says mutlple times, that if he manage to take one of her punches he's done for and avoided  touching her at all times.",

Genin, Chunin, Jonin and Kage. if you are Kage (i.e) when you are officially given the Kage rank you become Either Hokage, Kazekage, Mizukage, Raikage or Tsuchikage depending on which village you get that rank. The prefix just represent which village you belong to, ex Hokage -> Fire shadow(cuz land of fire), Mizukage-> Water shadow(cuz land of rain) etc.   \n\n\nAlthough not officially given the rank there are plenty of kage level ninjas in Hidden leaf. Madara, Itachi, Sishui, Sasuke, Ooruchimaru, Jiraya, Gai all of them are Kage level but have not given the official Rank. doesn't mean they are less level than Hokage. Also it depends on political aspects too. Kage has administrative task and the Rank is given based on the current Kage's opinion too. For example Danzo is equally skilled as Hiruzen but Tobirama chose Hiruzen.  \n\n\nits like in a military some people prefer to be in field as Captain rather than to sit behind a desk as Admiral.

She's literally the leader of Konoha's Intel divisions and the Yamanaka clan. How in the world can she lead them without having the proper rank? Same goes for Choji. Head of the Akimichi clan and still Chunin? Nah, I don't believe it. \n\nShino is an interesting case because he's deliberately denying promotion for Jonin due to his work at the academy(whilst also presumably being head of the Aburame clan). Kiba and Tenten are the iffy ones to be honest. Tenten has the intelligence to achieve the rank, but probably lacks the power needed as well. Kiba on the otherhand is the reverse. Has the power, but lacks the brains. Although doesn't make too much sense since Lee is Jonin.\n\n Hinata's case is more obvious. She pretty much retired from ninja life during the Last era. She could have achieved the rank at some point before conceiving Boruto. Basically all of them should be Jonin besides Hinata and Shino because of personal choices.",

I also believe that she did love him at that point too, just not full on romantic. There were hints that she liked him even at the start of Shippuden, but this is when all of that ended.\n\nShe didn't want Naruto to go through any more of this shit because of her, and in her head, it made sense. Is it well written? No. Kishimoto is pretty bad at this kind of stuff, tbh, but it makes sense to anyone who isn't dead set on hating Sakura for no real reason.\n\nMy biggest problem with romance in Naruto is that nobody actually dates. Lmao they pick someone they like as a kid and end up married, unless they are Choji. Lol",

They've been shown to contradict canon many times.\n\nSecondly, this doesn't address the fact that we are very explicitly told that Hiruzen is too old and doesn't feel he should be Hokage anymore and steps down for Minato to take his place. The hokage is not just a normal rank, you can't have multiple ninja be Hokage, it's a position that only one person can fill at a time. Like this is just a fact, like hiruzen isn't wearing the hokage robe when the nine tails attacks the village and Minato makes a big show of doing specifically that. Were also told they had to ask hiruzen to retake the mantle. Like seriously you didn't pay attention if you thought multiple people can be Hokage at once. \n\nThen on top of this, hokage is a special rank, it's not like Jonin, chunin or genin. It's seperate, that graphic of chapter 9 is Kakashi explaining the mission system to a young Naruto and hokage is where it is to show that the hokage is the most capable ninja in the village. We see Naruto in the boruto manga tell Kawaki that he is still a genin. He never got promoted. Being hokage doesn't automatically mean he's been promoted past Jonin, but when you're hokage that ranking system doesn't even really apply. You're hokage because you're the strongest ninja, you don't need those ranks to classify you.\n\nTo conclude, Naruto is a genin and hokage and there can only be one hokage at a time.",

Like fuck man. Kakashi literally is telling you, the reader, that these ranks signify different groups og strength and you still don't understand how positions like hokage, Jonin commander, special Jonin, etc fit in to those general groupings. \n\nThe hokage is the strongest ninja and is the leader on the council with the two elders and danzo, but it ultimately in charge, answering only to the fire daimo. The Jonin commander is an exemplary strategic leader in charge of the Jonin, despite the name, you could technically have a genin become Jonin commander like Naruto became hokage despite being genin. Both retain their previous rank of genin. You've got special Jonin which are ninja not strong enough in all areas to be a full Jonin, but excel in one area to Jonin level. It's actually unclear if this actually removes your previous rank, but I imagine all the special Jonin where chunin before being made special Jonin. \n\nThen you've got the normal progression of every ninja. You're an academy student, until you graduate and are promoted to genin. You remain a genin until you take the chunin exams where you have a chance to showcase your skills and be promoted to Chunin. Then as a chunin, you can be nominated to become Jonin, which will be considered by the hokage. \n\nNaruto failed every chunin exam he attended and was thus never promoted to Chunin. After the war Naruto just never bothers doing the chunin exams again and remains a genin until Kakashi hands over the position to Naruto. Naruto never got promoted from genin.",

In the past there wasn't such possibility since next Kage was promoted after the previous one died. I think the good analogy is current situation with the Popes.

A couple of individuals *happen* to be godlike in a particular timeframe in the history of narutoverse. That doesn't mean being Hokage is a different level.  \n\n\nThe whole reason everyone thinks is because of Hashirama/tobirama/hiruzen and minato. They just happened to be kage Ranked Ninjas who are gifted.   \n\n\nFor example, if the US Navy has 3 4 Admirals who are exceptionally great, thats just coincidence. doesn't mean that US Admiral in general is a superior thing compared to other army Admirals  nor it means that other US Admirals who succeed that 3 4 exceptional admiral are any different than those admiral(In terms of rank)  \n\n\nin short, Being a hokage automatically doesn't make you better than other kage. There is obviously an individual aspect to it (i.e) one kage is better than others etc\n\nIf you think about it, we can't really separate like that. if that's the case, then Madara is godlike. Im pretty sure during his time he was stronger than any shinobi in the world except hashirama. but he was never a Hokage.  So is jiraya and ooruchimaru for their generation. If you think about it, post war arc Sasuke is Demi-god. He is still not a Hokage. Killer B was stronger than Aay in pre-war arc. But he was not a raikage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Hokage is just a rank it has nothing to do with the skill level. in Narutoverse, all Kage's(one who officially got the rank) are Hokages if they are from leaf village.  \n\n\nBut i do agree ur argument that all Hokage's are usually powerful than any other Kage's in the world but thats just coincidence and should be taken in individual level not a rank level",

Yeah most Kages are prodigys but you guys are not giving enough credit for Sakura. By the end of fourth ninja war she was stronger than tsunade both physically and in medical jutsu. And tsunade healed up an entire village with her jutsu. Not to mention she has hashiramas healing cells. If Sakura is stronger than her, thats definetly worth Kage level.\n\nAlso comparing people to Kages of hidden leaf its not fair. Hashirama is God, tobirama, hiruzen and minato are like Newton, einstien and Stephen hawking's of ninja world, they are special even for Kages. Sakura Is definitely stronger than Kakashi and tsunade.",

But in terms of raw strength Sakura is stronger than kakashi. a deathmatch is not a good metric for anything in naruto because it depends on a lot of things like anticipating your enemy moves, compatibility of your chakra element vs your enemy, the terrain you fight etc.\n\nAlthough, I truly believe that kakashi would only win because of his experience. Even with his Sharingan, Sakura have the advantage of healing herself until he runs out of chakra(his chakra has a draining disadvantage due to always on sharingan). it wont be an easy fight for her but the probability of winning is not 0.  \n\n\nas for chidori, The Creation Rebirth jutsu can keep you undamaged until you run out of chakra. so i think she can take a chidori or two before she gets fucked up.",

How could she ever be?\n\njust because someone is not born in a specific OP family doesn't mean they can't become strong. Hiruzen has no such lineage. The Sarutobi clan fought the clan wars but they were no special but Hiruzen trained his ass to become one of the only two ninjas to master all chakra element without any powerups like sage mode or Kekkai Genkai.Sakura mastered Byakugo at the age of 17 which is considered The pinnacle of Chakra control. The only other confirmed user is Tsunade herself. Mito had the rhombus in her forehead but it was never confirmed she is a user. she also mastered Creation Rebirth which is S class technique. She is one of the only two Medical Ninja who is allowed to fight in the frontline. She's stronger than all kunoichis of her generation(including other villages).\n\nCreation rebirth is a rare technique, it literally accelerates your body's cell division thus healing any damage you get. combining it with the 100 seals, you are literally in Hashirama territory(although only till you run out of chakra). Tsunade healed herself as if its nothing after taking a big slash from Madara's Susano. Mastering that technique is God like chakra control in entire narutoverse.\n\nWith physical strength, she's powerful than most Jonins. in the second training fight with Kakashi and naruto where kakashi shows off his hand sign skills, he says mutlple times, that if he manage to take one of her punches he's done for and avoided  touching her at all times.",

The prefix just represent which village you belong to, ex Hokage -> Fire shadow(cuz land of fire), Mizukage-> Water shadow(cuz land of rain) etc.   \n\n\nAlthough not officially given the rank there are plenty of kage level ninjas in Hidden leaf. Madara, Itachi, Sishui, Sasuke, Ooruchimaru, Jiraya, Gai all of them are Kage level but have not given the official Rank. doesn't mean they are less level than Hokage. Also it depends on political aspects too. Kage has administrative task and the Rank is given based on the current Kage's opinion too. For example Danzo is equally skilled as Hiruzen but Tobirama chose Hiruzen.  \n\n\nits like in a military some people prefer to be in field as Captain rather than to sit behind a desk as Admiral.

Nah, I don't believe it. \n\nShino is an interesting case because he's deliberately denying promotion for Jonin due to his work at the academy(whilst also presumably being head of the Aburame clan). Kiba and Tenten are the iffy ones to be honest. Tenten has the intelligence to achieve the rank, but probably lacks the power needed as well. Kiba on the otherhand is the reverse. Has the power, but lacks the brains. Although doesn't make too much sense since Lee is Jonin.\n\n Hinata's case is more obvious. She pretty much retired from ninja life during the Last era. She could have achieved the rank at some point before conceiving Boruto. Basically all of them should be Jonin besides Hinata and Shino because of personal choices.",

Lol While it wasn't the smartest play, it makes sense why she did it. Sai telling her that it was her fault that Naruto was doing all this is the real reason that she wanted him to stop. I also believe that she did love him at that point too, just not full on romantic. There were hints that she liked him even at the start of Shippuden, but this is when all of that ended.\n\nShe didn't want Naruto to go through any more of this shit because of her, and in her head, it made sense. Is it well written? No. Kishimoto is pretty bad at this kind of stuff, tbh, but it makes sense to anyone who isn't dead set on hating Sakura for no real reason.\n\nMy biggest problem with romance in Naruto is that nobody actually dates. Lmao they pick someone they like as a kid and end up married, unless they are Choji. Lol",

They've been shown to contradict canon many times.\n\nSecondly, this doesn't address the fact that we are very explicitly told that Hiruzen is too old and doesn't feel he should be Hokage anymore and steps down for Minato to take his place. The hokage is not just a normal rank, you can't have multiple ninja be Hokage, it's a position that only one person can fill at a time. Like this is just a fact, like hiruzen isn't wearing the hokage robe when the nine tails attacks the village and Minato makes a big show of doing specifically that. Were also told they had to ask hiruzen to retake the mantle. Like seriously you didn't pay attention if you thought multiple people can be Hokage at once. \n\nThen on top of this, hokage is a special rank, it's not like Jonin, chunin or genin. It's seperate, that graphic of chapter 9 is Kakashi explaining the mission system to a young Naruto and hokage is where it is to show that the hokage is the most capable ninja in the village. We see Naruto in the boruto manga tell Kawaki that he is still a genin. He never got promoted. Being hokage doesn't automatically mean he's been promoted past Jonin, but when you're hokage that ranking system doesn't even really apply. You're hokage because you're the strongest ninja, you don't need those ranks to classify you.\n\nTo conclude, Naruto is a genin and hokage and there can only be one hokage at a time.",

Kakashi literally is telling you, the reader, that these ranks signify different groups og strength and you still don't understand how positions like hokage, Jonin commander, special Jonin, etc fit in to those general groupings. \n\nThe hokage is the strongest ninja and is the leader on the council with the two elders and danzo, but it ultimately in charge, answering only to the fire daimo. The Jonin commander is an exemplary strategic leader in charge of the Jonin, despite the name, you could technically have a genin become Jonin commander like Naruto became hokage despite being genin. Both retain their previous rank of genin. You've got special Jonin which are ninja not strong enough in all areas to be a full Jonin, but excel in one area to Jonin level. It's actually unclear if this actually removes your previous rank, but I imagine all the special Jonin where chunin before being made special Jonin. \n\nThen you've got the normal progression of every ninja. You're an academy student, until you graduate and are promoted to genin. You remain a genin until you take the chunin exams where you have a chance to showcase your skills and be promoted to Chunin. Then as a chunin, you can be nominated to become Jonin, which will be considered by the hokage. \n\nNaruto failed every chunin exam he attended and was thus never promoted to Chunin. After the war Naruto just never bothers doing the chunin exams again and remains a genin until Kakashi hands over the position to Naruto. Naruto never got promoted from genin.",

We see characters calling Kakashi Rokudaime even after Naruto is in charge of the village now. So there can be one *active* Hokage at one time but there can be still multiple people with the same rank. In the past there wasn't such possibility since next Kage was promoted after the previous one died. I think the good analogy is current situation with the Popes. Current Pope is Pope Francis but there is Pope Benedict XVI who is still alive but retired. Pope Benedict XVI isn't in charge of The Church but he is still the Pope.",

A couple of individuals *happen* to be godlike in a particular timeframe in the history of narutoverse. That doesn't mean being Hokage is a different level.  \n\n\nThe whole reason everyone thinks is because of Hashirama/tobirama/hiruzen and minato. They just happened to be kage Ranked Ninjas who are gifted.   \n\n\nFor example, if the US Navy has 3 4 Admirals who are exceptionally great, thats just coincidence. doesn't mean that US Admiral in general is a superior thing compared to other army Admirals  nor it means that other US Admirals who succeed that 3 4 exceptional admiral are any different than those admiral(In terms of rank)  \n\n\nin short, Being a hokage automatically doesn't make you better than other kage. There is obviously an individual aspect to it (i.e) one kage is better than others etc\n\nIf you think about it, we can't really separate like that. if that's the case, then Madara is godlike. Im pretty sure during his time he was stronger than any shinobi in the world except hashirama. but he was never a Hokage.  So is jiraya and ooruchimaru for their generation. If you think about it, post war arc Sasuke is Demi-god. He is still not a Hokage. Killer B was stronger than Aay in pre-war arc. But he was not a raikage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Hokage is just a rank it has nothing to do with the skill level. in Narutoverse, all Kage's(one who officially got the rank) are Hokages if they are from leaf village.  \n\n\nBut i do agree ur argument that all Hokage's are usually powerful than any other Kage's in the world but thats just coincidence and should be taken in individual level not a rank level",

Shikamaru was the only one who passed Chunin exam because everyone thought that with his wit he has the potential to be a Kage one day. Yeah most Kages are prodigys but you guys are not giving enough credit for Sakura. By the end of fourth ninja war she was stronger than tsunade both physically and in medical jutsu. And tsunade healed up an entire village with her jutsu. Not to mention she has hashiramas healing cells. If Sakura is stronger than her, thats definetly worth Kage level.\n\nAlso comparing people to Kages of hidden leaf its not fair. Hashirama is God, tobirama, hiruzen and minato are like Newton, einstien and Stephen hawking's of ninja world, they are special even for Kages. Sakura Is definitely stronger than Kakashi and tsunade.",

But in terms of raw strength Sakura is stronger than kakashi. a deathmatch is not a good metric for anything in naruto because it depends on a lot of things like anticipating your enemy moves, compatibility of your chakra element vs your enemy, the terrain you fight etc.\n\nAlthough, I truly believe that kakashi would only win because of his experience. Even with his Sharingan, Sakura have the advantage of healing herself until he runs out of chakra(his chakra has a draining disadvantage due to always on sharingan). it wont be an easy fight for her but the probability of winning is not 0.  \n\n\nas for chidori, The Creation Rebirth jutsu can keep you undamaged until you run out of chakra. so i think she can take a chidori or two before she gets fucked up.",

How could she ever be?\n\njust because someone is not born in a specific OP family doesn't mean they can't become strong. Hiruzen has no such lineage. The Sarutobi clan fought the clan wars but they were no special but Hiruzen trained his ass to become one of the only two ninjas to master all chakra element without any powerups like sage mode or Kekkai Genkai.Sakura mastered Byakugo at the age of 17 which is considered The pinnacle of Chakra control. The only other confirmed user is Tsunade herself. Mito had the rhombus in her forehead but it was never confirmed she is a user. she also mastered Creation Rebirth which is S class technique. She is one of the only two Medical Ninja who is allowed to fight in the frontline. She's stronger than all kunoichis of her generation(including other villages).\n\nCreation rebirth is a rare technique, it literally accelerates your body's cell division thus healing any damage you get. combining it with the 100 seals, you are literally in Hashirama territory(although only till you run out of chakra). Tsunade healed herself as if its nothing after taking a big slash from Madara's Susano. Mastering that technique is God like chakra control in entire narutoverse.\n\nWith physical strength, she's powerful than most Jonins. in the second training fight with Kakashi and naruto where kakashi shows off his hand sign skills, he says mutlple times, that if he manage to take one of her punches he's done for and avoided  touching her at all times.",

Genin, Chunin, Jonin and Kage. if you are Kage (i.e) when you are officially given the Kage rank you become Either Hokage, Kazekage, Mizukage, Raikage or Tsuchikage depending on which village you get that rank. The prefix just represent which village you belong to, ex Hokage -> Fire shadow(cuz land of fire), Mizukage-> Water shadow(cuz land of rain) etc.   \n\n\nAlthough not officially given the rank there are plenty of kage level ninjas in Hidden leaf. Madara, Itachi, Sishui, Sasuke, Ooruchimaru, Jiraya, Gai all of them are Kage level but have not given the official Rank. doesn't mean they are less level than Hokage. Also it depends on political aspects too. Kage has administrative task and the Rank is given based on the current Kage's opinion too. For example Danzo is equally skilled as Hiruzen but Tobirama chose Hiruzen.  \n\n\nits like in a military some people prefer to be in field as Captain rather than to sit behind a desk as Admiral. Doesn't mean they are any less than an Admiral in terms of skill.",

Nah, I don't believe it. \n\nShino is an interesting case because he's deliberately denying promotion for Jonin due to his work at the academy(whilst also presumably being head of the Aburame clan). Kiba and Tenten are the iffy ones to be honest. Tenten has the intelligence to achieve the rank, but probably lacks the power needed as well. Kiba on the otherhand is the reverse. Has the power, but lacks the brains. Although doesn't make too much sense since Lee is Jonin.\n\n Hinata's case is more obvious. She pretty much retired from ninja life during the Last era. She could have achieved the rank at some point before conceiving Boruto. Basically all of them should be Jonin besides Hinata and Shino because of personal choices.",

Sai telling her that it was her fault that Naruto was doing all this is the real reason that she wanted him to stop. I also believe that she did love him at that point too, just not full on romantic. There were hints that she liked him even at the start of Shippuden, but this is when all of that ended.\n\nShe didn't want Naruto to go through any more of this shit because of her, and in her head, it made sense. Is it well written? No. Kishimoto is pretty bad at this kind of stuff, tbh, but it makes sense to anyone who isn't dead set on hating Sakura for no real reason.\n\nMy biggest problem with romance in Naruto is that nobody actually dates. Lmao they pick someone they like as a kid and end up married, unless they are Choji. Lol",

Kakashi literally is telling you, the reader, that these ranks signify different groups og strength and you still don't understand how positions like hokage, Jonin commander, special Jonin, etc fit in to those general groupings. \n\nThe hokage is the strongest ninja and is the leader on the council with the two elders and danzo, but it ultimately in charge, answering only to the fire daimo. The Jonin commander is an exemplary strategic leader in charge of the Jonin, despite the name, you could technically have a genin become Jonin commander like Naruto became hokage despite being genin. Both retain their previous rank of genin. You've got special Jonin which are ninja not strong enough in all areas to be a full Jonin, but excel in one area to Jonin level. It's actually unclear if this actually removes your previous rank, but I imagine all the special Jonin where chunin before being made special Jonin. \n\nThen you've got the normal progression of every ninja. You're an academy student, until you graduate and are promoted to genin. You remain a genin until you take the chunin exams where you have a chance to showcase your skills and be promoted to Chunin. Then as a chunin, you can be nominated to become Jonin, which will be considered by the hokage. \n\nNaruto failed every chunin exam he attended and was thus never promoted to Chunin. After the war Naruto just never bothers doing the chunin exams again and remains a genin until Kakashi hands over the position to Naruto. Naruto never got promoted from genin.",

In the past there wasn't such possibility since next Kage was promoted after the previous one died. I think the good analogy is current situation with the Popes.

But in terms of raw strength Sakura is stronger than kakashi. a deathmatch is not a good metric for anything in naruto because it depends on a lot of things like anticipating your enemy moves, compatibility of your chakra element vs your enemy, the terrain you fight etc.\n\nAlthough, I truly believe that kakashi would only win because of his experience. Even with his Sharingan, Sakura have the advantage of healing herself until he runs out of chakra(his chakra has a draining disadvantage due to always on sharingan). it wont be an easy fight for her but the probability of winning is not 0.  \n\n\nas for chidori, The Creation Rebirth jutsu can keep you undamaged until you run out of chakra. so i think she can take a chidori or two before she gets fucked up.",

Hiruzen has no such lineage. The Sarutobi clan fought the clan wars but they were no special but Hiruzen trained his ass to become one of the only two ninjas to master all chakra element without any powerups like sage mode or Kekkai Genkai.Sakura mastered Byakugo at the age of 17 which is considered The pinnacle of Chakra control. The only other confirmed user is Tsunade herself. Mito had the rhombus in her forehead but it was never confirmed she is a user. she also mastered Creation Rebirth which is S class technique. She is one of the only two Medical Ninja who is allowed to fight in the frontline. She's stronger than all kunoichis of her generation(including other villages).\n\nCreation rebirth is a rare technique, it literally accelerates your body's cell division thus healing any damage you get. combining it with the 100 seals, you are literally in Hashirama territory(although only till you run out of chakra). Tsunade healed herself as if its nothing after taking a big slash from Madara's Susano. Mastering that technique is God like chakra control in entire narutoverse.\n\nWith physical strength, she's powerful than most Jonins. in the second training fight with Kakashi and naruto where kakashi shows off his hand sign skills, he says mutlple times, that if he manage to take one of her punches he's done for and avoided  touching her at all times.",

Genin, Chunin, Jonin and Kage. if you are Kage (i.e) when you are officially given the Kage rank you become Either Hokage, Kazekage, Mizukage, Raikage or Tsuchikage depending on which village you get that rank. The prefix just represent which village you belong to, ex Hokage -> Fire shadow(cuz land of fire), Mizukage-> Water shadow(cuz land of rain) etc.   \n\n\nAlthough not officially given the rank there are plenty of kage level ninjas in Hidden leaf. Madara, Itachi, Sishui, Sasuke, Ooruchimaru, Jiraya, Gai all of them are Kage level but have not given the official Rank. doesn't mean they are less level than Hokage. Also it depends on political aspects too. Kage has administrative task and the Rank is given based on the current Kage's opinion too. For example Danzo is equally skilled as Hiruzen but Tobirama chose Hiruzen.  \n\n\nits like in a military some people prefer to be in field as Captain rather than to sit behind a desk as Admiral.

How in the world can she lead them without having the proper rank? Same goes for Choji. Head of the Akimichi clan and still Chunin? Nah, I don't believe it. \n\nShino is an interesting case because he's deliberately denying promotion for Jonin due to his work at the academy(whilst also presumably being head of the Aburame clan). Kiba and Tenten are the iffy ones to be honest. Tenten has the intelligence to achieve the rank, but probably lacks the power needed as well. Kiba on the otherhand is the reverse. Has the power, but lacks the brains. Although doesn't make too much sense since Lee is Jonin.\n\n Hinata's case is more obvious. She pretty much retired from ninja life during the Last era. She could have achieved the rank at some point before conceiving Boruto. Basically all of them should be Jonin besides Hinata and Shino because of personal choices.",

There were hints that she liked him even at the start of Shippuden, but this is when all of that ended.\n\nShe didn't want Naruto to go through any more of this shit because of her, and in her head, it made sense. Is it well written? No. Kishimoto is pretty bad at this kind of stuff, tbh, but it makes sense to anyone who isn't dead set on hating Sakura for no real reason.\n\nMy biggest problem with romance in Naruto is that nobody actually dates. Lmao they pick someone they like as a kid and end up married, unless they are Choji. Lol",

Kakashi literally is telling you, the reader, that these ranks signify different groups og strength and you still don't understand how positions like hokage, Jonin commander, special Jonin, etc fit in to those general groupings. \n\nThe hokage is the strongest ninja and is the leader on the council with the two elders and danzo, but it ultimately in charge, answering only to the fire daimo. The Jonin commander is an exemplary strategic leader in charge of the Jonin, despite the name, you could technically have a genin become Jonin commander like Naruto became hokage despite being genin. Both retain their previous rank of genin. You've got special Jonin which are ninja not strong enough in all areas to be a full Jonin, but excel in one area to Jonin level. It's actually unclear if this actually removes your previous rank, but I imagine all the special Jonin where chunin before being made special Jonin. \n\nThen you've got the normal progression of every ninja. You're an academy student, until you graduate and are promoted to genin. You remain a genin until you take the chunin exams where you have a chance to showcase your skills and be promoted to Chunin. Then as a chunin, you can be nominated to become Jonin, which will be considered by the hokage. \n\nNaruto failed every chunin exam he attended and was thus never promoted to Chunin. After the war Naruto just never bothers doing the chunin exams again and remains a genin until Kakashi hands over the position to Naruto. Naruto never got promoted from genin.",

Even on wiki Naruto's rank is Kage since Gaiden and in page about Shinobi system Kage is in ranks section just as Genin etc. I posted scan where Hiruzen explained ranks, scan from databook about ranks, scan of Naruto's page from Boruto movie databook where his rank is Hokage. Their responses were their own headcanons and scene from anime which was joke and also mistranslated and they don't even remember it correctly because Iwabe's team changed to Boruto or Kawaki in their descriptions xD. Wanted to show support so you know that there are people who read manga and know basic stuff about it.",

Even with his Sharingan, Sakura have the advantage of healing herself until he runs out of chakra(his chakra has a draining disadvantage due to always on sharingan). it wont be an easy fight for her but the probability of winning is not 0.  \n\n\nas for chidori, The Creation Rebirth jutsu can keep you undamaged until you run out of chakra. so i think she can take a chidori or two before she gets fucked up.",

Hiruzen has no such lineage. The Sarutobi clan fought the clan wars but they were no special but Hiruzen trained his ass to become one of the only two ninjas to master all chakra element without any powerups like sage mode or Kekkai Genkai.Sakura mastered Byakugo at the age of 17 which is considered The pinnacle of Chakra control. The only other confirmed user is Tsunade herself. Mito had the rhombus in her forehead but it was never confirmed she is a user. she also mastered Creation Rebirth which is S class technique. She is one of the only two Medical Ninja who is allowed to fight in the frontline. She's stronger than all kunoichis of her generation(including other villages).\n\nCreation rebirth is a rare technique, it literally accelerates your body's cell division thus healing any damage you get. combining it with the 100 seals, you are literally in Hashirama territory(although only till you run out of chakra). Tsunade healed herself as if its nothing after taking a big slash from Madara's Susano. Mastering that technique is God like chakra control in entire narutoverse.\n\nWith physical strength, she's powerful than most Jonins. in the second training fight with Kakashi and naruto where kakashi shows off his hand sign skills, he says mutlple times, that if he manage to take one of her punches he's done for and avoided  touching her at all times.",

Genin, Chunin, Jonin and Kage. if you are Kage (i.e) when you are officially given the Kage rank you become Either Hokage, Kazekage, Mizukage, Raikage or Tsuchikage depending on which village you get that rank. The prefix just represent which village you belong to, ex Hokage -> Fire shadow(cuz land of fire), Mizukage-> Water shadow(cuz land of rain) etc.   \n\n\nAlthough not officially given the rank there are plenty of kage level ninjas in Hidden leaf. Madara, Itachi, Sishui, Sasuke, Ooruchimaru, Jiraya, Gai all of them are Kage level but have not given the official Rank. doesn't mean they are less level than Hokage. Also it depends on political aspects too. Kage has administrative task and the Rank is given based on the current Kage's opinion too. For example Danzo is equally skilled as Hiruzen but Tobirama chose Hiruzen.  \n\n\nits like in a military some people prefer to be in field as Captain rather than to sit behind a desk as Admiral.

How in the world can she lead them without having the proper rank? Same goes for Choji. Head of the Akimichi clan and still Chunin? Nah, I don't believe it. \n\nShino is an interesting case because he's deliberately denying promotion for Jonin due to his work at the academy(whilst also presumably being head of the Aburame clan). Kiba and Tenten are the iffy ones to be honest. Tenten has the intelligence to achieve the rank, but probably lacks the power needed as well. Kiba on the otherhand is the reverse. Has the power, but lacks the brains. Although doesn't make too much sense since Lee is Jonin.\n\n Hinata's case is more obvious. She pretty much retired from ninja life during the Last era. She could have achieved the rank at some point before conceiving Boruto. Basically all of them should be Jonin besides Hinata and Shino because of personal choices.",

There were hints that she liked him even at the start of Shippuden, but this is when all of that ended.\n\nShe didn't want Naruto to go through any more of this shit because of her, and in her head, it made sense. Is it well written? No. Kishimoto is pretty bad at this kind of stuff, tbh, but it makes sense to anyone who isn't dead set on hating Sakura for no real reason.\n\nMy biggest problem with romance in Naruto is that nobody actually dates. Lmao they pick someone they like as a kid and end up married, unless they are Choji. Lol",

We see characters calling Kakashi Rokudaime even after Naruto is in charge of the village now.

In the past there wasn't such possibility since next Kage was promoted after the previous one died. I think the good analogy is current situation with the Popes. Current Pope is Pope Francis but there is Pope Benedict XVI who is still alive but retired. Pope Benedict XVI isn't in charge of The Church but he is still the Pope.",

How in the world can she lead them without having the proper rank? Same goes for Choji. Head of the Akimichi clan and still Chunin? Nah, I don't believe it. \n\nShino is an interesting case because he's deliberately denying promotion for Jonin due to his work at the academy(whilst also presumably being head of the Aburame clan). Kiba and Tenten are the iffy ones to be honest. Tenten has the intelligence to achieve the rank, but probably lacks the power needed as well. Kiba on the otherhand is the reverse. Has the power, but lacks the brains. Although doesn't make too much sense since Lee is Jonin.\n\n Hinata's case is more obvious. She pretty much retired from ninja life during the Last era. She could have achieved the rank at some point before conceiving Boruto. Basically all of them should be Jonin besides Hinata and Shino because of personal choices.",

Sai telling her that it was her fault that Naruto was doing all this is the real reason that she wanted him to stop. I also believe that she did love him at that point too, just not full on romantic. There were hints that she liked him even at the start of Shippuden, but this is when all of that ended.\n\nShe didn't want Naruto to go through any more of this shit because of her, and in her head, it made sense. Is it well written? No. Kishimoto is pretty bad at this kind of stuff, tbh, but it makes sense to anyone who isn't dead set on hating Sakura for no real reason.\n\nMy biggest problem with romance in Naruto is that nobody actually dates. Lmao they pick someone they like as a kid and end up married, unless they are Choji. Lol",

Sai telling her that it was her fault that Naruto was doing all this is the real reason that she wanted him to stop. I also believe that she did love him at that point too, just not full on romantic. There were hints that she liked him even at the start of Shippuden, but this is when all of that ended.\n\nShe didn't want Naruto to go through any more of this shit because of her, and in her head, it made sense. Is it well written? No. Kishimoto is pretty bad at this kind of stuff, tbh, but it makes sense to anyone who isn't dead set on hating Sakura for no real reason.\n\nMy biggest problem with romance in Naruto is that nobody actually dates. Lmao they pick someone they like as a kid and end up married, unless they are Choji. Lol",

Sai telling her that it was her fault that Naruto was doing all this is the real reason that she wanted him to stop. I also believe that she did love him at that point too, just not full on romantic. There were hints that she liked him even at the start of Shippuden, but this is when all of that ended.\n\nShe didn't want Naruto to go through any more of this shit because of her, and in her head, it made sense. Is it well written? No. Kishimoto is pretty bad at this kind of stuff, tbh, but it makes sense to anyone who isn't dead set on hating Sakura for no real reason.\n\nMy biggest problem with romance in Naruto is that nobody actually dates. Lmao they pick someone they like as a kid and end up married, unless they are Choji. Lol",

Sai telling her that it was her fault that Naruto was doing all this is the real reason that she wanted him to stop. I also believe that she did love him at that point too, just not full on romantic. There were hints that she liked him even at the start of Shippuden, but this is when all of that ended.\n\nShe didn't want Naruto to go through any more of this shit because of her, and in her head, it made sense. Is it well written? No. Kishimoto is pretty bad at this kind of stuff, tbh, but it makes sense to anyone who isn't dead set on hating Sakura for no real reason.\n\nMy biggest problem with romance in Naruto is that nobody actually dates. Lmao they pick someone they like as a kid and end up married, unless they are Choji. Lol",

Sai telling her that it was her fault that Naruto was doing all this is the real reason that she wanted him to stop. I also believe that she did love him at that point too, just not full on romantic. There were hints that she liked him even at the start of Shippuden, but this is when all of that ended.\n\nShe didn't want Naruto to go through any more of this shit because of her, and in her head, it made sense. Is it well written? No. Kishimoto is pretty bad at this kind of stuff, tbh, but it makes sense to anyone who isn't dead set on hating Sakura for no real reason.\n\nMy biggest problem with romance in Naruto is that nobody actually dates. Lmao they pick someone they like as a kid and end up married, unless they are Choji. Lol",
