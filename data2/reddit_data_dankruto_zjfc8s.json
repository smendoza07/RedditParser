It may come out of your body in water droplets, but it sheds from any mucus or saliva droplets and goes into the air infecting others and can last in the air for a long time if direct sunlight is not able to kill the bacteria droplets. The amount of time and close proximity that Itachi spent with Kisame and other Akatsuki members, he would have likely put so much of the bacteria in them that one of them would have become actively sick from it as well. It honestly seems more likely he has MPA than TB, but as me and the other commenter agreed it could just be TB with lazy writing. \n\nTrue that if his TB wasn\u2019t in his lungs he wouldn\u2019t be spreading it, but he also wouldn\u2019t be coughing really at all he would have different symptoms. Which we know he coughs from his illness and it was a respiratory illness, it would be incredibly unlikely that it was a non pulmonary TB infection. We also don\u2019t know narutoverse medicine capabilites. We would assume since it\u2019s not something that they are able to treat enough to cure, that their medicinal technology is not that high. He would have remained infectious until he passed away during his fight with Sasuke, and he most likely would not have been able to exert himself like he did during the fight and other times.",

As you say, the bacteria get spread by water droplets, but you need to be near the sick for a prolonged stretch lf time for it to get to your lungs, and even then not everyone develops symptoms, sometimes the bacteria just gets inside the lymphatic nodes and stays there dormant for years. It's probable that Sasuke and the rest of the Akatsuki had dormant Ninja TB, just waiting for their ninja immune system to slip up.",

It may come out of your body in water droplets, but it sheds from any mucus or saliva droplets and goes into the air infecting others and can last in the air for a long time if direct sunlight is not able to kill the bacteria droplets. The amount of time and close proximity that Itachi spent with Kisame and other Akatsuki members, he would have likely put so much of the bacteria in them that one of them would have become actively sick from it as well. It honestly seems more likely he has MPA than TB, but as me and the other commenter agreed it could just be TB with lazy writing. \n\nTrue that if his TB wasn\u2019t in his lungs he wouldn\u2019t be spreading it, but he also wouldn\u2019t be coughing really at all he would have different symptoms. Which we know he coughs from his illness and it was a respiratory illness, it would be incredibly unlikely that it was a non pulmonary TB infection. We also don\u2019t know narutoverse medicine capabilites. We would assume since it\u2019s not something that they are able to treat enough to cure, that their medicinal technology is not that high. He would have remained infectious until he passed away during his fight with Sasuke, and he most likely would not have been able to exert himself like he did during the fight and other times.",

It may come out of your body in water droplets, but it sheds from any mucus or saliva droplets and goes into the air infecting others and can last in the air for a long time if direct sunlight is not able to kill the bacteria droplets. The amount of time and close proximity that Itachi spent with Kisame and other Akatsuki members, he would have likely put so much of the bacteria in them that one of them would have become actively sick from it as well. It honestly seems more likely he has MPA than TB, but as me and the other commenter agreed it could just be TB with lazy writing. \n\nTrue that if his TB wasn\u2019t in his lungs he wouldn\u2019t be spreading it, but he also wouldn\u2019t be coughing really at all he would have different symptoms. Which we know he coughs from his illness and it was a respiratory illness, it would be incredibly unlikely that it was a non pulmonary TB infection. We also don\u2019t know narutoverse medicine capabilites. We would assume since it\u2019s not something that they are able to treat enough to cure, that their medicinal technology is not that high. He would have remained infectious until he passed away during his fight with Sasuke, and he most likely would not have been able to exert himself like he did during the fight and other times.",

You can\u2019t really be inoculated effectively against TB either, there is a vaccine, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily fully protect you.

The amount of time and close proximity that Itachi spent with Kisame and other Akatsuki members, he would have likely put so much of the bacteria in them that one of them would have become actively sick from it as well. It honestly seems more likely he has MPA than TB, but as me and the other commenter agreed it could just be TB with lazy writing. \n\nTrue that if his TB wasn\u2019t in his lungs he wouldn\u2019t be spreading it, but he also wouldn\u2019t be coughing really at all he would have different symptoms. Which we know he coughs from his illness and it was a respiratory illness, it would be incredibly unlikely that it was a non pulmonary TB infection. We also don\u2019t know narutoverse medicine capabilites. We would assume since it\u2019s not something that they are able to treat enough to cure, that their medicinal technology is not that high.

Not saying Kisame can\u2019t be immune to bacterial disease, but it\u2019s not likely just because he\u2019s got shark mixed in his humanness that he is automatic immune. You can\u2019t really be inoculated effectively against TB either, there is a vaccine, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily fully protect you.

It may come out of your body in water droplets, but it sheds from any mucus or saliva droplets and goes into the air infecting others and can last in the air for a long time if direct sunlight is not able to kill the bacteria droplets. The amount of time and close proximity that Itachi spent with Kisame and other Akatsuki members, he would have likely put so much of the bacteria in them that one of them would have become actively sick from it as well. It honestly seems more likely he has MPA than TB, but as me and the other commenter agreed it could just be TB with lazy writing. \n\nTrue that if his TB wasn\u2019t in his lungs he wouldn\u2019t be spreading it, but he also wouldn\u2019t be coughing really at all he would have different symptoms. Which we know he coughs from his illness and it was a respiratory illness, it would be incredibly unlikely that it was a non pulmonary TB infection. We also don\u2019t know narutoverse medicine capabilites. We would assume since it\u2019s not something that they are able to treat enough to cure, that their medicinal technology is not that high. He would have remained infectious until he passed away during his fight with Sasuke, and he most likely would not have been able to exert himself like he did during the fight and other times.",
