    "body": "Hi everyone :) This is a long post, but it\u2019s story time. There have been a few posts about HSV/STIs in the last few weeks. I\u2019ve commented/messaged people separately, but I wanted to create a new post so others could see it too - for empowerment and education and continuing to reduce the stigma.\n\nI\u2019m in my early 30s, and I have herpes. I\u2019d like to share my initial experience on SA so far. First, I was diagnosed when I was 19. When I got that phone call, I wanted to DIE. I cried every day for 6 months and genuinely thought there wasn\u2019t a man who would want to touch me again. \n\nI started learning about it and went to therapy. In one support group, a 50-year-old man couldn\u2019t even say the word herpes. It made me think, oh my god - this stupid virus is literally ruining the ONE life we have for NO reason  (except b/c of stigma)! Fast forward 12 years. I\u2019ve had lots of casual and serious relationships (of course, disclosing every time). I\u2019ve been with really kind and caring men. No one has contracted it.\n\nSo I\u2019m back in grad school and signed up for SA last summer. I poured over this sub and talked to a few amazing HSV+ ladies (on a different Reddit account). But I chickened out before my first M&G and took a step back.\n\nI recently made a new profile. Added a sultry photo without my face. And I disclosed in my bio: \u201cI\u2019m HSV-2 positive. 1 in 8 people have it, and 80% of those people don't know they have it. Research has shown there is a 99% chance it won't be passed on. Let me know if you have any questions :)\u201d Because ladies - the risk is around 1-2% with antivirals and condoms. You have a higher risk of getting pregnant on some forms of birth control than you do passing on this virus.\n\nAnd guess what. I get messages every day. There ARE people who look at my profile and pass. But I\u2019m blown away at the POTs who don\u2019t care. We start talking, and I ask if they\u2019ve read my entire profile. They say yes, and here are some of their responses:\n\n\u201cYeah, I actually have it too.\u201d \n\u201cMy dad/brother are doctors, and I\u2019m familiar with it. It doesn\u2019t bother me\u201d\n\u201cI asked my doctor once why they don\u2019t test for it, and she told me a lot about it.\u201d\n\u201cThat was really bold and refreshing of you to share.\u201d\n\u201cMy ex of 12 years had it, and I never contracted it.\u201d\n\u201cNo worries - it\u2019s so common, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve been with people who have it.\u201d\n\u201cThanks for letting me know :) It doesn\u2019t bother me.\u201d\n\nAND MORE. Some SDs even start off with how much they appreciate my transparency. I KNOW there are people on this sub who would pass. I know the stigma is real. But I\u2019ve set up half a dozen M&Gs, and they\u2019ve all agreed to get a full panel themselves if we decided to move forward.\n\nI\u2019m not saying disclosing on your profile is the way to go. I don\u2019t disclose on my other dating profiles. But the moral of this long story: HSV+ SBs. There is a place for you in the bowl. There is a place for you in vanilla dating. You are so much more than a diagnosis. Yes, there are people who will decline, but please do not let this stigma hold you back. Please feel free to message me anytime.\n\nThanks for listening to my TedTalk :)\n\nEDIT 1: Slight correction on a stat thanks to a lovely commenter below. There\u2019s also info about asymptomatic viral shedding that I didn\u2019t write above, but that I ALWAYS share.\n\nEDIT 2: Please know - the point of this post is to encourage folks who feel disempowered or less than because of this virus. Even if POTs decline an arrangement, people with HSV can still put themselves out there and have success (given they disclose, share accurate info, and minimize risk). Our lives do not need to be \u201cruined,\u201d and there ARE partners who will be okay with it. That is the point of this supportive post <3 More detail in a comment below.\n\nEDIT 3: I honestly don\u2019t know how to Reddit, but thank you for these awards!! \ud83d\ude2d And for your kind comments and messages! I would tell this story over and over if it meant helping other people. Others did that for me when I needed it too <3",

She dated him for at least a year and he didn\u2019t get it.

With taking a while off from dating I\u2019ve realized the stigma honestly is the worst part. I haven\u2019t put myself back on SA because I\u2019ve been scared but met another SD on positives (not great pool of people tho) your post has encouraged me to be more brave. It\u2019s like fate you posting aha thank you \ud83e\udd0e\n\nP.s the real thing I\u2019m scared of honestly is not finding true love or if I date this guy who doesn\u2019t have hsv & if he contracts it after a while of being together he will hate me after feeling the pain of the outbreak. Little fear I always have, people say they\u2019re cool with alotta things until actually experiencing it :( it just sucks the mental mind game of being young and getting hsv because I only lost my virginity 2 years prior to that so thoughts of shit not being fair creeps up at times, but just reminding myself that it\u2019s not a big deal honestly a skin rash if keeping it real just gotta let the annoying voice in my head to stop punishing myself for what\u2019s outta my control now.",

Honestly, I think its the responsibility of everyone who is sexually active to do their part to end stigma. People who don't have herpes really need to listen when someone with herpes educates them. And people need to take responsibility and educate themselves when someone discloses. I don't have HSV 2 but I would 100% engage sexually with someone who was honest with me about their status and safety methods. Herpes stigma needs to end, and the onus is on HSV negative people to end it. Connecting with the human in front of me is so much more important to me then the very low risk of catching a mild skin nuisance.",

Also would like to add that it doesn\u2019t even have to be transmitted through genital - genital sex, kissin/ oral sex/ or someone having a cold sore outbreak doesn\u2019t wash their hands and simply touches you on your genitals, all of this can also fall into the asymptomatic category... unfortunately. This is specifically for the freaked out guys in this post: You know how you men love bj\u2019s without condoms. \nSo yeah it\u2019s way more easier to catch it in other ways than just regular sex. One of the reasons why people don\u2019t even know they\u2019re infected because it isn\u2019t always via sex sex. Lots of high school/college wrestlers get it via these way. Suck a chick tits when your asymptotic, then she tity f**ks you... same result. So many variables. It\u2019s far more easy to catch than we think sadly. Probably why dr.s don\u2019t make it a priority to test unless requested.",

It's approximately 8% among caucasians (non-Hispanic whites to be precise) and <4% among Asians.\n\nIn other words, it's pretty uncommon.\n\nAsymptomatic viral shedding -- the way it's transmitted -- is happening 10% of the time. In other words, 10% of the time you look and feel fine... but you're contagious. It's twice as contagious during an outbreak, with 1 in 5 days being a viral shedding day.\n\nIn short, you can get HSV-2 from someone who seems fine. \n\nI'm glad you're finding willing partners. The risk of HSV-2 transmission is fairly high such as these things go. Someone with it on antivirals is definitely a lower risk. But I'm not sure it's fair to compare the risk to pregnancy for a lot of reasons.",

Valtrex cuts that transmission risk in half. A 2016 study showed that condom use cuts transmission an additional 65% from women to men (and by 96% from men to women). Several birth control methods, because they aren\u2019t taken 100% accurately, are about 91% effective.\n\nMy intention behind this post was not to minimize the risk, say it\u2019s not a big deal to some folks, or promote misinformation. My point was also not to say it\u2019s common. (You\u2019re correct on the 12% - I was familiar with a higher stat from a few years ago). \n\nI understand personally the immense psychological toll this virus can have. I had a very, very difficult time. We see posts on here discussing it. When you have HSV, you hear negative comments ALL the time. I know people who have been suicidal after being diagnosed. \n\nKnowing how hard a diagnosis can be, the point of this post was to offer empowerment and share that HSV+ folks have a right to be here too (given they disclose and minimize risk). And no matter how much people play devil\u2019s advocate or say, \u201cBut it\u2019s still bad!\u201d \u2014 there ARE partners who will be okay with it. Until you\u2019ve been diagnosed with HSV, you really don\u2019t understand how much you need to hear AND experience that. \n\nI\u2019m sure some responses will try to play devil\u2019s advocate, disparage HSV, or refute what I\u2019m saying. But this post wasn\u2019t intended for them. It\u2019s intended to encourage those who are feeling disempowered or less than because of this virus. And to let them know that \u2014 even though some POTs might decline \u2014 they can put themselves out there and have success, just like everyone else.",

Valtrex cuts that transmission risk in half. A 2016 study showed that condom use cuts transmission an additional 65% from women to men (and by 96% from men to women). Several birth control methods, because they aren\u2019t taken 100% accurately, are about 91% effective.\n\nMy intention behind this post was not to minimize the risk, say it\u2019s not a big deal to some folks, or promote misinformation. My point was also not to say it\u2019s common. (You\u2019re correct on the 12% - I was familiar with a higher stat from a few years ago). \n\nI understand personally the immense psychological toll this virus can have. I had a very, very difficult time. We see posts on here discussing it. When you have HSV, you hear negative comments ALL the time. I know people who have been suicidal after being diagnosed. \n\nKnowing how hard a diagnosis can be, the point of this post was to offer empowerment and share that HSV+ folks have a right to be here too (given they disclose and minimize risk). And no matter how much people play devil\u2019s advocate or say, \u201cBut it\u2019s still bad!\u201d \u2014 there ARE partners who will be okay with it. Until you\u2019ve been diagnosed with HSV, you really don\u2019t understand how much you need to hear AND experience that. \n\nI\u2019m sure some responses will try to play devil\u2019s advocate, disparage HSV, or refute what I\u2019m saying. But this post wasn\u2019t intended for them. It\u2019s intended to encourage those who are feeling disempowered or less than because of this virus. And to let them know that \u2014 even though some POTs might decline \u2014 they can put themselves out there and have success, just like everyone else.",

In fact, I'd daresay if you there was asymptomatic shedding of oral HSV-1, it would be close to 100% in people over 50. And it isn't.~~\n\n~~Anyway, more information is good. And making informed choices is good.~~  \n\n\nEDIT: I now see I got downvote cabal for my post above containing factual CDC data. I have a strict rule of not participating in any threads attacked by the downvote cabal. Good luck to all.",

The number of musicians, actors, athletes that have it always seemed high to me and I always chalked it up to more partners, so taking it to the next step that hot girls also are more likely is consistent. Especially in the tinder era when research shows good looking guys are far more sexually active than less good looking guys (delta has increased with time, which researchers say is due to dating apps, women's sexual preferences and men that will sleep with anyone).",

You'd have to specifically ask for HSV, because the reliability of the test is so low without an active break-out present. And you don't really want to be handing out potentially false negative results. \n\nSemi-related, a lot of doctors won't include HIV either without explicitly asking for it to be done. Partly due to stigma, partly due to cost. \nIt blew my mind because when I lived outside the US, HIV was always included in a standard panel.",
