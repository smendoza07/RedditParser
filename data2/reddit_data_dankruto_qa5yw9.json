Sasuke got the shit beat out of him like I did to many soyboys who thought they could slap my wife's ass and get away with it. He was low on chakra too, and a little boy flying through the air super fast making minimal noise going from his blind spot and he still detected what was happening is something to be proud of. Giving too much hate when you understand nothing. He is trained enough to notice what was happening under all those circumstances when any other ninja, maybe even Madara, wouldn't have seen it coming.",

I think Baryon is personally more impressive as the reason it shaves life off the opponent is because it literally starts to burn their Chakra. No other move that I know of in the Narutoverse is capable of burning another person's chakra/life force just by any physical contact, let alone gives the power boost it does.\n\nGuy is impressive because in 8 gates, he's the strongest \"regular\" shinobi. But he's nowhere near as impressive as Baryon, which is basically a God killer move that could only be used once, with the only real side effect is one of the Chakra pools being completely drained. Guy would have died with 8th gate if Naruto didn't get back in time, plus he is stuck in a wheelchair as a consequence. Guy in that moment is a monster, capable of taking down any enemy under Juubito, but the threats have only gotten bigger, for better or worse.",

I don't know if I'm in the minority or not, but I think the animation was excellent and made perfect sense to me. If anything, using rasengan and punching Isshiki across the field seemed like a waste. Naruto just needed to touch Isshiki as much as possible for baryon to work the way he needed it to, so anything flashier was a waste of Chakra, time, and complete fan service.\n\nIt's not underwhelming at all, imo, as it made the strongest enemy in the Narutoverse so far, into fodder for the protagonist. That's the strength of baryon mode: beating Isshiki with the basics. No Naruto vs. Sasuke shit where there is a Susano being powered up by other tailed beasts and a giant kurama punching each other's fists. That worked for their story, but even then, the most emotionally impactful moments of that fight were the hand to hand. Starting with Sasuke continually interrupting Naruto's shadow clone weave because he knows that's Naruto's specialty, and ending with the two of them barely able to stand, and it becoming a sloppy slugfest.\n\nIn Boruto we don't have that connection to Isshiki, as the main conflict we are leading up to is Boruto vs. Kawaki. By the time we get there, it will be a bigger deal, and a flashier fight, but Baryon was meant to give us fans one more big hurrah with Naruto before he is sidelined for the actual MC of the series. Baryon works because Naruto and Kurama can't waste much Chakra in order to maintain the form, and \"sparring\", if you can call it that, was the way to show how strong baryon is. A simple rasengan without the scream as he activates it, and a bunch of hand to hand, is all Naruto needs to decimate Isshiki. A character we know to be able to pull Sasuke from his Susano, and Naruto from his kurama avatar, while they are the strongest they've ever been. It completely turns the tables, it just lacks emotional weight until Kawaki starts having his panic attack towards the end of the fight, and as kurama \"dies\".",

An easy benchmark would be how many successful series they've created over the years. Yeah, if you've been doing it for decades then bad ideas are bound to appear but if you constantly need a good editor to steer you then maybe you're not that good of a writer after all. Samurai 8 failed exactly because they gave too much leeway to Kishimoto due to Naruto's success and it showed.\n\nImo when you talk about the best mangaka of all time then names like Osamu Tezuka, Akira Toriyama, Rumiko Takahashi, Hiromu Arakawa, and of course Togashi should come before Kishimoto even if their own magnum opus is not as big as Naruto (with the exception of Toriyama).

I think the show made it clear that sure each eye has its own power and sharingans give certain abilities from these eyes but once unlocked you dont need said eyes. Theres more examples of people with sharingan using abilities and not having eyes for them but i forget. I do agree though I think it would be cooler if they did make it so the eyes were required for said powers. How sasukes eyes how most people think it works where one eye needs the other because one controls the others power is cool, jus wish it worked like that cause it does but once unlocked they no longer have dependence in the sense that he doesn't even need one of his eyes or potentially either.",

At least before Naruto lost Kurama, he got his last few moments of glory. \n\nI used to justify Kishimoto\u2019s writing but this is just too much to try to make sense out of. I\u2019m pretty sure he took over from Kodachi a few chapters before Jigen/Isshiki\u2019s arc. He\u2019s rushing things, trying to make the deadline for the timeskip. And it\u2019s just awful writing at this point. I get that it\u2019s Boruto\u2019s show but come on now. Naruto reached his peak form at the end of his show. Meanwhile, Boruto\u2019s already the strongest and we\u2019re not even at the timeskip arc yet. He spent decades of his life powering up Naruto and Sasuke and now, he just turned them into ragdolls.",

As Kurama was saying, minimal movements and precise strikes are the key to stretching Baryon mode out at long as possible. It wouldn\u2019t do any good if Naruto blew through his entire chakra reserve for Baryon mode in one space bending punch that likely wouldn\u2019t have stopped Isshiki.",

No other move that I know of in the Narutoverse is capable of burning another person's chakra/life force just by any physical contact, let alone gives the power boost it does.\n\nGuy is impressive because in 8 gates, he's the strongest \"regular\" shinobi. But he's nowhere near as impressive as Baryon, which is basically a God killer move that could only be used once, with the only real side effect is one of the Chakra pools being completely drained. Guy would have died with 8th gate if Naruto didn't get back in time, plus he is stuck in a wheelchair as a consequence. Guy in that moment is a monster, capable of taking down any enemy under Juubito, but the threats have only gotten bigger, for better or worse.",

Guy is strong, like I said, but it's a glass cannon. I'd assume Genjutsu would work on him still, but Madara liked playing with everyone, as shown when he decided to tank the hit from Night Guy. We also don't know if Susano would get cracked with 8 gates, but assuming it can, there are other ways Sasuke could avoid getting hit. Sasuke isn't dumb. He scales higher than Guy, even if raw power is Guy's advantage.",

I don't know if I'm in the minority or not, but I think the animation was excellent and made perfect sense to me. If anything, using rasengan and punching Isshiki across the field seemed like a waste. Naruto just needed to touch Isshiki as much as possible for baryon to work the way he needed it to, so anything flashier was a waste of Chakra, time, and complete fan service.\n\nIt's not underwhelming at all, imo, as it made the strongest enemy in the Narutoverse so far, into fodder for the protagonist. That's the strength of baryon mode: beating Isshiki with the basics. No Naruto vs. Sasuke shit where there is a Susano being powered up by other tailed beasts and a giant kurama punching each other's fists. That worked for their story, but even then, the most emotionally impactful moments of that fight were the hand to hand. Starting with Sasuke continually interrupting Naruto's shadow clone weave because he knows that's Naruto's specialty, and ending with the two of them barely able to stand, and it becoming a sloppy slugfest.\n\nIn Boruto we don't have that connection to Isshiki, as the main conflict we are leading up to is Boruto vs. Kawaki. By the time we get there, it will be a bigger deal, and a flashier fight, but Baryon was meant to give us fans one more big hurrah with Naruto before he is sidelined for the actual MC of the series. Baryon works because Naruto and Kurama can't waste much Chakra in order to maintain the form, and \"sparring\", if you can call it that, was the way to show how strong baryon is. A simple rasengan without the scream as he activates it, and a bunch of hand to hand, is all Naruto needs to decimate Isshiki. A character we know to be able to pull Sasuke from his Susano, and Naruto from his kurama avatar, while they are the strongest they've ever been. It completely turns the tables, it just lacks emotional weight until Kawaki starts having his panic attack towards the end of the fight, and as kurama \"dies\".",

People hate Boruto for a million things, but ignore that it is under the supervision, and now creation, of the OG.",

Kodachi is the one who planned everything and Kishimoto entered at the very end of the arc, so Kodachi likely had it all planned out and Kishimoto had to execute it before plugging in his ideas for the next arc.\n\nAgain I'm not excusing Kishimoto but I doubt any of this was his vision for Boruto. The fact that Boruto wasn't his idea, he didn't want to write it, and he was writing another manga for three years should tell you how invested he was in the creation even if he was a supervisor.",

At the end of the day he's a professional and once he took over he should've done his best to rectify whatever he felt lacking.

He's a great artist but generally a poor storyteller. He had a lot of dumb ideas that got shot down and rectified by his editors in Naruto. Samurai 8 is what happens when you pair him with an incompetent editor.",

And the thing about a lot of dumb ideas meaning kishimoto is a bad storyteller is bull. This shit ran for 14+ years so of course  dumb ideas are gonna pop out eventually. And that's why your editor is there to keep you on track.  The best there is Echirio Oda himself undoubtedly had some dumb ideas that were scrapped. Have you seen what the original \"Romance Dawn\" chapter and the story line of one piece looked like?? Not bad but leagues below what we currently have. He has also messed up in the classification of devil fruits and shit. Like not everyone is perfect man. Imo he is the best manga author after Oda sensei himself. Third is author of H\u00d7H",

An easy benchmark would be how many successful series they've created over the years. Yeah, if you've been doing it for decades then bad ideas are bound to appear but if you constantly need a good editor to steer you then maybe you're not that good of a writer after all. Samurai 8 failed exactly because they gave too much leeway to Kishimoto due to Naruto's success and it showed.\n\nImo when you talk about the best mangaka of all time then names like Osamu Tezuka, Akira Toriyama, Rumiko Takahashi, Hiromu Arakawa, and of course Togashi should come before Kishimoto even if their own magnum opus is not as big as Naruto (with the exception of Toriyama). Kishimoto is still young and has time to prove himself but I think he needs to catch up to the current manga trend before he can produce another hit.",

I think the show made it clear that sure each eye has its own power and sharingans give certain abilities from these eyes but once unlocked you dont need said eyes. Theres more examples of people with sharingan using abilities and not having eyes for them but i forget. I do agree though I think it would be cooler if they did make it so the eyes were required for said powers. How sasukes eyes how most people think it works where one eye needs the other because one controls the others power is cool, jus wish it worked like that cause it does but once unlocked they no longer have dependence in the sense that he doesn't even need one of his eyes or potentially either.",

As Kurama was saying, minimal movements and precise strikes are the key to stretching Baryon mode out at long as possible.

But he's nowhere near as impressive as Baryon, which is basically a God killer move that could only be used once, with the only real side effect is one of the Chakra pools being completely drained. Guy would have died with 8th gate if Naruto didn't get back in time, plus he is stuck in a wheelchair as a consequence. Guy in that moment is a monster, capable of taking down any enemy under Juubito, but the threats have only gotten bigger, for better or worse.",

Guy is strong, like I said, but it's a glass cannon. I'd assume Genjutsu would work on him still, but Madara liked playing with everyone, as shown when he decided to tank the hit from Night Guy. We also don't know if Susano would get cracked with 8 gates, but assuming it can, there are other ways Sasuke could avoid getting hit. Sasuke isn't dumb. He scales higher than Guy, even if raw power is Guy's advantage.",

If anything, using rasengan and punching Isshiki across the field seemed like a waste. Naruto just needed to touch Isshiki as much as possible for baryon to work the way he needed it to, so anything flashier was a waste of Chakra, time, and complete fan service.\n\nIt's not underwhelming at all, imo, as it made the strongest enemy in the Narutoverse so far, into fodder for the protagonist. That's the strength of baryon mode: beating Isshiki with the basics. No Naruto vs. Sasuke shit where there is a Susano being powered up by other tailed beasts and a giant kurama punching each other's fists. That worked for their story, but even then, the most emotionally impactful moments of that fight were the hand to hand. Starting with Sasuke continually interrupting Naruto's shadow clone weave because he knows that's Naruto's specialty, and ending with the two of them barely able to stand, and it becoming a sloppy slugfest.\n\nIn Boruto we don't have that connection to Isshiki, as the main conflict we are leading up to is Boruto vs. Kawaki. By the time we get there, it will be a bigger deal, and a flashier fight, but Baryon was meant to give us fans one more big hurrah with Naruto before he is sidelined for the actual MC of the series. Baryon works because Naruto and Kurama can't waste much Chakra in order to maintain the form, and \"sparring\", if you can call it that, was the way to show how strong baryon is. A simple rasengan without the scream as he activates it, and a bunch of hand to hand, is all Naruto needs to decimate Isshiki. A character we know to be able to pull Sasuke from his Susano, and Naruto from his kurama avatar, while they are the strongest they've ever been. It completely turns the tables, it just lacks emotional weight until Kawaki starts having his panic attack towards the end of the fight, and as kurama \"dies\".",

And that's why your editor is there to keep you on track.  The best there is Echirio Oda himself undoubtedly had some dumb ideas that were scrapped. Have you seen what the original \"Romance Dawn\" chapter and the story line of one piece looked like?? Not bad but leagues below what we currently have. He has also messed up in the classification of devil fruits and shit. Like not everyone is perfect man. Imo he is the best manga author after Oda sensei himself. Third is author of H\u00d7H",

An easy benchmark would be how many successful series they've created over the years. Yeah, if you've been doing it for decades then bad ideas are bound to appear but if you constantly need a good editor to steer you then maybe you're not that good of a writer after all. Samurai 8 failed exactly because they gave too much leeway to Kishimoto due to Naruto's success and it showed.\n\nImo when you talk about the best mangaka of all time then names like Osamu Tezuka, Akira Toriyama, Rumiko Takahashi, Hiromu Arakawa, and of course Togashi should come before Kishimoto even if their own magnum opus is not as big as Naruto (with the exception of Toriyama). Kishimoto is still young and has time to prove himself but I think he needs to catch up to the current manga trend before he can produce another hit.",

I think the show made it clear that sure each eye has its own power and sharingans give certain abilities from these eyes but once unlocked you dont need said eyes. Theres more examples of people with sharingan using abilities and not having eyes for them but i forget. I do agree though I think it would be cooler if they did make it so the eyes were required for said powers. How sasukes eyes how most people think it works where one eye needs the other because one controls the others power is cool, jus wish it worked like that cause it does but once unlocked they no longer have dependence in the sense that he doesn't even need one of his eyes or potentially either.",

No other move that I know of in the Narutoverse is capable of burning another person's chakra/life force just by any physical contact, let alone gives the power boost it does.\n\nGuy is impressive because in 8 gates, he's the strongest \"regular\" shinobi. But he's nowhere near as impressive as Baryon, which is basically a God killer move that could only be used once, with the only real side effect is one of the Chakra pools being completely drained. Guy would have died with 8th gate if Naruto didn't get back in time, plus he is stuck in a wheelchair as a consequence. Guy in that moment is a monster, capable of taking down any enemy under Juubito, but the threats have only gotten bigger, for better or worse.",

If anything, using rasengan and punching Isshiki across the field seemed like a waste. Naruto just needed to touch Isshiki as much as possible for baryon to work the way he needed it to, so anything flashier was a waste of Chakra, time, and complete fan service.\n\nIt's not underwhelming at all, imo, as it made the strongest enemy in the Narutoverse so far, into fodder for the protagonist. That's the strength of baryon mode: beating Isshiki with the basics. No Naruto vs. Sasuke shit where there is a Susano being powered up by other tailed beasts and a giant kurama punching each other's fists. That worked for their story, but even then, the most emotionally impactful moments of that fight were the hand to hand. Starting with Sasuke continually interrupting Naruto's shadow clone weave because he knows that's Naruto's specialty, and ending with the two of them barely able to stand, and it becoming a sloppy slugfest.\n\nIn Boruto we don't have that connection to Isshiki, as the main conflict we are leading up to is Boruto vs. Kawaki. By the time we get there, it will be a bigger deal, and a flashier fight, but Baryon was meant to give us fans one more big hurrah with Naruto before he is sidelined for the actual MC of the series. Baryon works because Naruto and Kurama can't waste much Chakra in order to maintain the form, and \"sparring\", if you can call it that, was the way to show how strong baryon is. A simple rasengan without the scream as he activates it, and a bunch of hand to hand, is all Naruto needs to decimate Isshiki. A character we know to be able to pull Sasuke from his Susano, and Naruto from his kurama avatar, while they are the strongest they've ever been. It completely turns the tables, it just lacks emotional weight until Kawaki starts having his panic attack towards the end of the fight, and as kurama \"dies\".",

A good story only really includes things that serve the plot, and that fight was to show how powerful the enemy really was. What better way than to show Naruto and Sasuke get bodied in their Kurama and Susano forms.",

And the thing about a lot of dumb ideas meaning kishimoto is a bad storyteller is bull. This shit ran for 14+ years so of course  dumb ideas are gonna pop out eventually. And that's why your editor is there to keep you on track.  The best there is Echirio Oda himself undoubtedly had some dumb ideas that were scrapped. Have you seen what the original \"Romance Dawn\" chapter and the story line of one piece looked like?? Not bad but leagues below what we currently have. He has also messed up in the classification of devil fruits and shit. Like not everyone is perfect man. Imo he is the best manga author after Oda sensei himself. Third is author of H\u00d7H",

An easy benchmark would be how many successful series they've created over the years. Yeah, if you've been doing it for decades then bad ideas are bound to appear but if you constantly need a good editor to steer you then maybe you're not that good of a writer after all. Samurai 8 failed exactly because they gave too much leeway to Kishimoto due to Naruto's success and it showed.\n\nImo when you talk about the best mangaka of all time then names like Osamu Tezuka, Akira Toriyama, Rumiko Takahashi, Hiromu Arakawa, and of course Togashi should come before Kishimoto even if their own magnum opus is not as big as Naruto (with the exception of Toriyama). Kishimoto is still young and has time to prove himself but I think he needs to catch up to the current manga trend before he can produce another hit.",

This is further shown when he literally cracks his bones from moving so fast and powerfully. He was surprised by the pain but acclimated and resumed max speed/power. \n\nBaryon Mode however lasts only as long as the chakra reserve does. As Kurama was saying, minimal movements and precise strikes are the key to stretching Baryon mode out at long as possible. It wouldn\u2019t do any good if Naruto blew through his entire chakra reserve for Baryon mode in one space bending punch that likely wouldn\u2019t have stopped Isshiki.",

I think Baryon is personally more impressive as the reason it shaves life off the opponent is because it literally starts to burn their Chakra. No other move that I know of in the Narutoverse is capable of burning another person's chakra/life force just by any physical contact, let alone gives the power boost it does.\n\nGuy is impressive because in 8 gates, he's the strongest \"regular\" shinobi. But he's nowhere near as impressive as Baryon, which is basically a God killer move that could only be used once, with the only real side effect is one of the Chakra pools being completely drained. Guy would have died with 8th gate if Naruto didn't get back in time, plus he is stuck in a wheelchair as a consequence. Guy in that moment is a monster, capable of taking down any enemy under Juubito, but the threats have only gotten bigger, for better or worse.",

If anything, using rasengan and punching Isshiki across the field seemed like a waste. Naruto just needed to touch Isshiki as much as possible for baryon to work the way he needed it to, so anything flashier was a waste of Chakra, time, and complete fan service.\n\nIt's not underwhelming at all, imo, as it made the strongest enemy in the Narutoverse so far, into fodder for the protagonist. That's the strength of baryon mode: beating Isshiki with the basics. No Naruto vs. Sasuke shit where there is a Susano being powered up by other tailed beasts and a giant kurama punching each other's fists. That worked for their story, but even then, the most emotionally impactful moments of that fight were the hand to hand. Starting with Sasuke continually interrupting Naruto's shadow clone weave because he knows that's Naruto's specialty, and ending with the two of them barely able to stand, and it becoming a sloppy slugfest.\n\nIn Boruto we don't have that connection to Isshiki, as the main conflict we are leading up to is Boruto vs. Kawaki. By the time we get there, it will be a bigger deal, and a flashier fight, but Baryon was meant to give us fans one more big hurrah with Naruto before he is sidelined for the actual MC of the series. Baryon works because Naruto and Kurama can't waste much Chakra in order to maintain the form, and \"sparring\", if you can call it that, was the way to show how strong baryon is. A simple rasengan without the scream as he activates it, and a bunch of hand to hand, is all Naruto needs to decimate Isshiki. A character we know to be able to pull Sasuke from his Susano, and Naruto from his kurama avatar, while they are the strongest they've ever been. It completely turns the tables, it just lacks emotional weight until Kawaki starts having his panic attack towards the end of the fight, and as kurama \"dies\".",

An easy benchmark would be how many successful series they've created over the years. Yeah, if you've been doing it for decades then bad ideas are bound to appear but if you constantly need a good editor to steer you then maybe you're not that good of a writer after all. Samurai 8 failed exactly because they gave too much leeway to Kishimoto due to Naruto's success and it showed.\n\nImo when you talk about the best mangaka of all time then names like Osamu Tezuka, Akira Toriyama, Rumiko Takahashi, Hiromu Arakawa, and of course Togashi should come before Kishimoto even if their own magnum opus is not as big as Naruto (with the exception of Toriyama). Kishimoto is still young and has time to prove himself but I think he needs to catch up to the current manga trend before he can produce another hit.",

No other move that I know of in the Narutoverse is capable of burning another person's chakra/life force just by any physical contact, let alone gives the power boost it does.\n\nGuy is impressive because in 8 gates, he's the strongest \"regular\" shinobi. But he's nowhere near as impressive as Baryon, which is basically a God killer move that could only be used once, with the only real side effect is one of the Chakra pools being completely drained. Guy would have died with 8th gate if Naruto didn't get back in time, plus he is stuck in a wheelchair as a consequence. Guy in that moment is a monster, capable of taking down any enemy under Juubito, but the threats have only gotten bigger, for better or worse.",

If anything, using rasengan and punching Isshiki across the field seemed like a waste. Naruto just needed to touch Isshiki as much as possible for baryon to work the way he needed it to, so anything flashier was a waste of Chakra, time, and complete fan service.\n\nIt's not underwhelming at all, imo, as it made the strongest enemy in the Narutoverse so far, into fodder for the protagonist. That's the strength of baryon mode: beating Isshiki with the basics. No Naruto vs. Sasuke shit where there is a Susano being powered up by other tailed beasts and a giant kurama punching each other's fists. That worked for their story, but even then, the most emotionally impactful moments of that fight were the hand to hand. Starting with Sasuke continually interrupting Naruto's shadow clone weave because he knows that's Naruto's specialty, and ending with the two of them barely able to stand, and it becoming a sloppy slugfest.\n\nIn Boruto we don't have that connection to Isshiki, as the main conflict we are leading up to is Boruto vs. Kawaki. By the time we get there, it will be a bigger deal, and a flashier fight, but Baryon was meant to give us fans one more big hurrah with Naruto before he is sidelined for the actual MC of the series. Baryon works because Naruto and Kurama can't waste much Chakra in order to maintain the form, and \"sparring\", if you can call it that, was the way to show how strong baryon is. A simple rasengan without the scream as he activates it, and a bunch of hand to hand, is all Naruto needs to decimate Isshiki. A character we know to be able to pull Sasuke from his Susano, and Naruto from his kurama avatar, while they are the strongest they've ever been. It completely turns the tables, it just lacks emotional weight until Kawaki starts having his panic attack towards the end of the fight, and as kurama \"dies\".",

Samurai 8 failed exactly because they gave too much leeway to Kishimoto due to Naruto's success and it showed.\n\nImo when you talk about the best mangaka of all time then names like Osamu Tezuka, Akira Toriyama, Rumiko Takahashi, Hiromu Arakawa, and of course Togashi should come before Kishimoto even if their own magnum opus is not as big as Naruto (with the exception of Toriyama).

And that's why your editor is there to keep you on track.  The best there is Echirio Oda himself undoubtedly had some dumb ideas that were scrapped. Have you seen what the original \"Romance Dawn\" chapter and the story line of one piece looked like?? Not bad but leagues below what we currently have. He has also messed up in the classification of devil fruits and shit. Like not everyone is perfect man. Imo he is the best manga author after Oda sensei himself. Third is author of H\u00d7H",

An easy benchmark would be how many successful series they've created over the years. Yeah, if you've been doing it for decades then bad ideas are bound to appear but if you constantly need a good editor to steer you then maybe you're not that good of a writer after all. Samurai 8 failed exactly because they gave too much leeway to Kishimoto due to Naruto's success and it showed.\n\nImo when you talk about the best mangaka of all time then names like Osamu Tezuka, Akira Toriyama, Rumiko Takahashi, Hiromu Arakawa, and of course Togashi should come before Kishimoto even if their own magnum opus is not as big as Naruto (with the exception of Toriyama). Kishimoto is still young and has time to prove himself but I think he needs to catch up to the current manga trend before he can produce another hit.",

An easy benchmark would be how many successful series they've created over the years. Yeah, if you've been doing it for decades then bad ideas are bound to appear but if you constantly need a good editor to steer you then maybe you're not that good of a writer after all. Samurai 8 failed exactly because they gave too much leeway to Kishimoto due to Naruto's success and it showed.\n\nImo when you talk about the best mangaka of all time then names like Osamu Tezuka, Akira Toriyama, Rumiko Takahashi, Hiromu Arakawa, and of course Togashi should come before Kishimoto even if their own magnum opus is not as big as Naruto (with the exception of Toriyama). Kishimoto is still young and has time to prove himself but I think he needs to catch up to the current manga trend before he can produce another hit.",
