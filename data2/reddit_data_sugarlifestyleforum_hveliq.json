They\u2019re just lonely and want a chatty friend. \n\nAnd I know it\u2019s not any better for SDs finding a SB that isn\u2019t platonic or online only. \n\nBut it makes it sooooooooo difficult for us to find each other. Wading through the fakes, flakes, and splendas. It\u2019s so disheartening. \n\nEnd rant. *takes a deep breath*",

The true nature of sugar relationships is closer to being a boyfriend. This modern NSA PPM arrangement thing is closer to prostitution. Sugar  Daddies have always been Sugar Boyfriends. Giving gifts, vacations, and shopping were all part of their relationship. Giving allowances was not mandatory to be considered a Sugar Daddy, most would pay your rent / bills.  \n\n\n> Someone that doesn\u2019t pay you really isn\u2019t bringing the sugar to the name anymore than they\u2019re bringing it to your life.\n\nSugar daddies don't pay you, if you want to 'get paid' you should become an escort. \n\nIn addition, sugar is not just money given to you, it is also money spent on you (gifts, shopping, trips, dinners, experiences).\n\nI think you need to do more research and look at the history of Sugar Dating prior to Seeking Arrangements.",

The true nature of sugar relationships is closer to being a boyfriend. This modern NSA PPM arrangement thing is closer to prostitution. Sugar  Daddies have always been Sugar Boyfriends. Giving gifts, vacations, and shopping were all part of their relationship. Giving allowances was not mandatory to be considered a Sugar Daddy, most would pay your rent / bills.  \n\n\n> Someone that doesn\u2019t pay you really isn\u2019t bringing the sugar to the name anymore than they\u2019re bringing it to your life.\n\nSugar daddies don't pay you, if you want to 'get paid' you should become an escort. \n\nIn addition, sugar is not just money given to you, it is also money spent on you (gifts, shopping, trips, dinners, experiences).\n\nI think you need to do more research and look at the history of Sugar Dating prior to Seeking Arrangements.",

The true nature of sugar relationships is closer to being a boyfriend. This modern NSA PPM arrangement thing is closer to prostitution. Sugar  Daddies have always been Sugar Boyfriends. Giving gifts, vacations, and shopping were all part of their relationship. Giving allowances was not mandatory to be considered a Sugar Daddy, most would pay your rent / bills.  \n\n\n> Someone that doesn\u2019t pay you really isn\u2019t bringing the sugar to the name anymore than they\u2019re bringing it to your life.\n\nSugar daddies don't pay you, if you want to 'get paid' you should become an escort. \n\nIn addition, sugar is not just money given to you, it is also money spent on you (gifts, shopping, trips, dinners, experiences).\n\nI think you need to do more research and look at the history of Sugar Dating prior to Seeking Arrangements.",
