    "body": "Hi everyone ! \nI'm getting more and more disappointed at the website seeking. I used to actually like it and I found most of my sugar daddies there but lately 2 sugar daddies contacted me and this is how it went: \n\" SD- Oh hi, I just found your profile and you are gorgeous. I would love to meet you. I think you are very interesting, and we have lots in common.  \" \nI was thinking that he seemed like a nice guy, by reading his profile. \nBut then, when we started the allowence talk he said this: \n\" Oh I don't think we are looking for the same thing. I want someone Who is with me because she likes me, I don't want to give you money in return or anything.\" \n\"Me: -Then if you don't want to give money or anything how would you claim to be a sugar daddy ? Why would I give anything to you or even meet you if I don't get anything ? You are on seeking, we seek sugar relationships here. Not normal ones. \"\nTo what he responded: \n\" I know that most women want money and stuff but I don't think they are all like that. \" \nJust wtf.  He's the second one sending a message like this. Is this happening to any of you ? What are they thinking ?",

That\u2019s a no for me even in vanilla dating!!\n\nDefinitely an odds thing like previously said. I feel like some guys try SA b/c much younger women will actually speak to them, while their chances are very low of matching & meeting 20-somethings on vanilla dating apps. On SA, if they\u2019re lucky, they might get a girl who doesn\u2019t bring up ppm/allowance/sugar at all before an m&g, & then they can try to steer it in their favor.",

They are guys who are out of their depth trying to get young girls who think they are \"wealthy\" and will support them with classy treats ,trips, and gifts. The joke is ultimately on the girls unfortunately.   \n\nAgain, Before meeting a \"SD\" ask, \"Are you a traditional SD who believes in the allowance sugar model\"  Only go if he says \"Yes\". Even then he could be lying or pays street walker rates but you won't get \" I want someone Who is with me because she likes me, I don't want to give you money in return or anything\".   \n\nI like the \"you get a hotel lined up and text me the room number.

Hence the advantage to those of both sexes that actively reach out.\n\nWhat is happening on SA is that it now has a representative profile of men in society (of whom only 5% can pay what on the allowance master thread).

That\u2019s a no for me even in vanilla dating!!\n\nDefinitely an odds thing like previously said. I feel like some guys try SA b/c much younger women will actually speak to them, while their chances are very low of matching & meeting 20-somethings on vanilla dating apps. On SA, if they\u2019re lucky, they might get a girl who doesn\u2019t bring up ppm/allowance/sugar at all before an m&g, & then they can try to steer it in their favor.",

That\u2019s a no for me even in vanilla dating!!\n\nDefinitely an odds thing like previously said. I feel like some guys try SA b/c much younger women will actually speak to them, while their chances are very low of matching & meeting 20-somethings on vanilla dating apps. On SA, if they\u2019re lucky, they might get a girl who doesn\u2019t bring up ppm/allowance/sugar at all before an m&g, & then they can try to steer it in their favor.",
