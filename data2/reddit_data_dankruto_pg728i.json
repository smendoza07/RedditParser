Etheir way realistically saying Tobirama gets the credit for reverse harem jutsu is like saying Kaguya gets the credit that Tobirama deserves since she is the progenitor of Chakra. It quite simply is too lame. I mean Naruto himself told Kaguya after he used reverse harem jutsu that she may be the progenitor of Chakra but she hasn't learned the history of jutsu and hasn't developed her chakra control. So honestly Naurto is the MVP who created the most overpowered Jutsu of all time!",

I mean Naruto himself told Kaguya after he used reverse harem jutsu that she may be the progenitor of Chakra but she hasn't learned the history of jutsu and hasn't developed her chakra control.

It quite simply is too lame. I mean Naruto himself told Kaguya after he used reverse harem jutsu that she may be the progenitor of Chakra but she hasn't learned the history of jutsu and hasn't developed her chakra control. So honestly Naurto is the MVP who created the most overpowered Jutsu of all time!",
