Hiruzen later sent Hayate to track down Kabuto in the Sand Village after discovering he was Orochimaru's spy (Hayate was a tracking ninja). Before he left, he and Yugao made a promise under the moon to always love each other. He was unfortunately KIA kind of brutally (apparently by Baki before he even managed to do very much). After this happened, Yugao struggled with being a soldier/being in ANBU and had some mild form of PTSD. Seemed like she'd sometimes get tremors of some sort while holding weapons.\n\nHe gets reanimated in the reanimation arc, during which all of this is shown. Yugao was deliberately sent to go face him. It was pretty sad.",

He likely could tell that Guy was right besides him and where he would be going for the moment they sprang into action. Since this is Guy's student, he may have decided to take it easy and leave his friend to actually restrain Neji. Considering he's holdig his forearm and Hayato seems completely unaffected despite having a Gentle Fist mere inches from his stomach, Kakashi may have opted to instead disable Neji's chakra flow/disrupting his attack, something his (experience with) the Sharingan (in combination with literal decades of experience in the field) should allow him to be capable of.",

Before he left, he and Yugao made a promise under the moon to always love each other. He was unfortunately KIA kind of brutally (apparently by Baki before he even managed to do very much). After this happened, Yugao struggled with being a soldier/being in ANBU and had some mild form of PTSD. Seemed like she'd sometimes get tremors of some sort while holding weapons.\n\nHe gets reanimated in the reanimation arc, during which all of this is shown. Yugao was deliberately sent to go face him. It was pretty sad.",

Neji is fast, but as proven here nowhere near the level of a jounin, so even at such close quarters, that blow would probably land.\n\nAdditionally, he might not even be really trying to stop Neji's momentum. He likely could tell that Guy was right besides him and where he would be going for the moment they sprang into action. Since this is Guy's student, he may have decided to take it easy and leave his friend to actually restrain Neji. Considering he's holdig his forearm and Hayato seems completely unaffected despite having a Gentle Fist mere inches from his stomach, Kakashi may have opted to instead disable Neji's chakra flow/disrupting his attack, something his (experience with) the Sharingan (in combination with literal decades of experience in the field) should allow him to be capable of.",

After this happened, Yugao struggled with being a soldier/being in ANBU and had some mild form of PTSD. Seemed like she'd sometimes get tremors of some sort while holding weapons.\n\nHe gets reanimated in the reanimation arc, during which all of this is shown.

It prevented her from becoming an amazing kunoichi, and it made the audience dislike her.

Neji is fast, but as proven here nowhere near the level of a jounin, so even at such close quarters, that blow would probably land.\n\nAdditionally, he might not even be really trying to stop Neji's momentum. He likely could tell that Guy was right besides him and where he would be going for the moment they sprang into action. Since this is Guy's student, he may have decided to take it easy and leave his friend to actually restrain Neji. Considering he's holdig his forearm and Hayato seems completely unaffected despite having a Gentle Fist mere inches from his stomach, Kakashi may have opted to instead disable Neji's chakra flow/disrupting his attack, something his (experience with) the Sharingan (in combination with literal decades of experience in the field) should allow him to be capable of.",

He likely could tell that Guy was right besides him and where he would be going for the moment they sprang into action. Since this is Guy's student, he may have decided to take it easy and leave his friend to actually restrain Neji. Considering he's holdig his forearm and Hayato seems completely unaffected despite having a Gentle Fist mere inches from his stomach, Kakashi may have opted to instead disable Neji's chakra flow/disrupting his attack, something his (experience with) the Sharingan (in combination with literal decades of experience in the field) should allow him to be capable of.",

Hiruzen later sent Hayate to track down Kabuto in the Sand Village after discovering he was Orochimaru's spy (Hayate was a tracking ninja). Before he left, he and Yugao made a promise under the moon to always love each other. He was unfortunately KIA kind of brutally (apparently by Baki before he even managed to do very much). After this happened, Yugao struggled with being a soldier/being in ANBU and had some mild form of PTSD. Seemed like she'd sometimes get tremors of some sort while holding weapons.\n\nHe gets reanimated in the reanimation arc, during which all of this is shown. Yugao was deliberately sent to go face him. It was pretty sad.",
