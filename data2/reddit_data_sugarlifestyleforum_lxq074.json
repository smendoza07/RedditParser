    "body": "I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/luscbt/my_sd_ended_our_sr_because_he_says_i_made_it_too/) a few days ago about my SD (53M) dumping me SB (27F) after 3 months in a SR together. He claimed he was ending it because I \"made the relationship too surface-level\" and that I \"didn't appreciate anything\" he did. You can likely tell from my post that I had significantly accommodated in attempt to make this man happy, adjust to his schedule, make him feel cherished, etc. So I (and many commenters on my previous post) were puzzled by his alleged reason to end things and guessed he wasn't being entirely truthful. Anyway, I really fell for this guy. I liked him a lot, really respected/looked up to him, felt emotionally connected to him, had similar values/interests to his, could talk to him for hours and still want more, was extremely attracted to him and very satisfied with our sexual relationship, etc... I thought I had found the near-perfect SR. However, this was his first SR ever. He had never even dabbled in the world of sugar. \n\nSince I was so confused by his abrupt ending of our SR and vague reasoning that didn't really make sense, I pressed him for more details (I know, not the best, but I was heartbroken). I finally got him to give me a little bit more, and he admitted that he had decided sugar relationships in general are not for him, due to him feeling that the \"sugar\" component is a barrier to any SR progressing on a deeper level. I understand and respect this. SRs sure as hell are not the \"norm\", and it took me quite a while to become comfortable with this world myself.\n\nThis is more of a PSA/warning about falling for new-to-the-game SDs. I swore I'd always keep my SDs at arm's length, which was easy for me to do when my all of my previous SDs were married. I knew there was no future. However, I fell *hard* for this man, and it bit me in the ass. I've thought about him endlessly since he ended it, can I can't stop crying. I know it'll get easier, but I may be wary of pursuing first-time SDs in the future.",

We went on one date where we talked for 5 hours about philosophy and I was basically in heaven....then after date he texted me and said it made him realize SRs are too transactional bc he would never know if I actually liked him. He offered to take me on a vanilla date and I had to say no since I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to give him the time/attention he deserved because I was actively pursuing an SR.

Wonder if he was hoping you would agree to keep seeing him without an allowance.  \n\nI see this theme a lot, where the SD bails for the excuse that money is polluting the relationship.   My view is that in sugar relationships with this large of an age gap, there is no real \u201cfuture\u201d.  BUT, that doesn\u2019t mean that one cannot have a deep connection with the SB, while at the same time being happy to support her financially.   Someone that tries to paint the two as being mutually exclusive strikes me as having an ulterior motive.  \n\nGuess I am in a cynical mood today.",

That's a great idea for you, when you have all these money... But for a SB... She will literally have to survive somehow... She may have these feelings, but has to pay her bills somehow (and official job is mostly not enough for that... Especially, with covid impact)... Are you fine  with seeing her starving?

He told me from the start that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the time and dedication that is required for traditional relationships\u201d which is why he pursued sugar.

They have wives for deeper emotional connections and SBs for fun.  A balanced SR can last a long time.  NOTE: balance works both ways.  The SB benefits from having a deep connection as well.\n\nI had a few years I went through a period when I was single and only subsisting on sugar...no vanilla in sight.   My memories of that time are awesome and at times I regret moving on to a new marriage.  But the reality of the time was different.  I was still incredibly lonely despite hooking up several days per week.  My sex life was awesome, but my personal and social life was shit.  Romance is so much more than humping.\n\nI recall that my main SB during my sexual revolution was really hurt when I would mention the various vanilla dates I was experiencing.  I had her...why was I constantly on the prowl for the next Mrs. Philly?   Why didn't I consider her for the position?  Fair questions with few answers.  For some reason, I couldn't consider any SBs, despite true loving feelings for them.  My hang ups, not any of theirs.",

We unlocked a fire storm...a 2nd honeymoon that lasted over a year. My satisfaction level was through the roof, as was hers, for a while.  At some point her energy dropped and she found 'like' with another guy.  She left me with 3 young kids.  \n\nI found the sugar world shortly thereafter.  It fit my schedule and afforded intimacy without emotional connection...which was a good thing after my 17 year marriage ended.  I was in a very bad place back then.  Sugar was safety.\n\nWhen I consider all the longer term sugar relationships I've had...there are a few that could have converted to vanilla.  Two of those ended when the SB got engaged to their own vanilla guy.  My current SB could easily go vanilla...but she is married with kids, so no bueno there, for now.  The SBs that wouldn't make my cut all had obvious trip wires...drug abuse, lesbian vanilla partners, younger than my kids, higher maintenance than I could provide....\n\nI read the wiki on that Madonna-whore complex.  There is some truth to that.  When we were having kids our lives were very hectic.  Finding time for ourselves was difficult.  Sadly, just as the domestic duties got easier, my wife left.",

He was a first-timer genuinely looking for casual sex (was not communicated) gave me a super high PPM the first date but then realized he actually liked me and decided he couldn't pay me otherwise our connection would seem inauthentic. Then he tried to vanilla date me without much communication about not wanting an arrangement anymore and it fell apart from there. It is really disappointing but remember that the money was what probably drew you to him and that if this were to go away, maybe you wouldn't have liked him as much. It sucks to say, but that's the reality I'm seeing. I hope you're able to move on and find someone special that is interested in how SRs actually work. \u2764\ufe0f",

At some point her energy dropped and she found 'like' with another guy.  She left me with 3 young kids.  \n\nI found the sugar world shortly thereafter.  It fit my schedule and afforded intimacy without emotional connection...which was a good thing after my 17 year marriage ended.  I was in a very bad place back then.  Sugar was safety.\n\nWhen I consider all the longer term sugar relationships I've had...there are a few that could have converted to vanilla.  Two of those ended when the SB got engaged to their own vanilla guy.  My current SB could easily go vanilla...but she is married with kids, so no bueno there, for now.  The SBs that wouldn't make my cut all had obvious trip wires...drug abuse, lesbian vanilla partners, younger than my kids, higher maintenance than I could provide....\n\nI read the wiki on that Madonna-whore complex.  There is some truth to that.  When we were having kids our lives were very hectic.  Finding time for ourselves was difficult.  Sadly, just as the domestic duties got easier, my wife left.",

At some point her energy dropped and she found 'like' with another guy.  She left me with 3 young kids.  \n\nI found the sugar world shortly thereafter.  It fit my schedule and afforded intimacy without emotional connection...which was a good thing after my 17 year marriage ended.  I was in a very bad place back then.  Sugar was safety.\n\nWhen I consider all the longer term sugar relationships I've had...there are a few that could have converted to vanilla.  Two of those ended when the SB got engaged to their own vanilla guy.  My current SB could easily go vanilla...but she is married with kids, so no bueno there, for now.  The SBs that wouldn't make my cut all had obvious trip wires...drug abuse, lesbian vanilla partners, younger than my kids, higher maintenance than I could provide....\n\nI read the wiki on that Madonna-whore complex.  There is some truth to that.  When we were having kids our lives were very hectic.  Finding time for ourselves was difficult.  Sadly, just as the domestic duties got easier, my wife left.",
