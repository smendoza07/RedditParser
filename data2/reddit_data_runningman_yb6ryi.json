I secretly wanna know what went down but at the same time I'm not at all ready or want there to be any actual stuff that went down so I'd rather just pretend nothing is wrong and they are secretly still good friends. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

But you've got to admit a lot of it doesn't look too great! Just one incident wouldn't be odd, it wouldn't stick out. But a few things happening definitely is kind of strange to say the least. But anything anyone says aside from those people who were actually there is going to be speculation! We just have to trust that if either of them had done something unspeakable or bad, that the others wouldn't have stayed friends with them. So it's at least safe to say that whatever happened between them is private and doesn't affect other people, so it really isn't anybody's business. \n\nDoes it suck? Yes. As a huge kwangMin fan (not shipper) it really does. I miss them rolling around on the floor wrestling over a hint. But oh well. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAnd I don't know anything about the agency. I do know she didn't do a music show, it was just a festival and she attended last year too. She just happened to go up on stage with Soran. I don't think it was official kingkong business, just SoMin having fun in her free time. \n\nShe is one of the best actresses around. She just won a best actress award at the drama awards. Any agency would be lucky to have her. I don't think they'll let her go easily.",

They literally stopped talking and reacting to each other and they almost never teamed up or partnered up after episode 525ish. In 524, they had a physical fight with the touch-counter vests and I think it was just a weird mood on set with everyone else standing around watching these two fight and not even laughing or interfering; and at one point I think KJK even said \"they're acting on real feelings\". That whole episode everyone seemed tense though; like Haha actually looked super mad at SJH for blowing/not blowing a whistle and LKS looked mad at YSC and haha and YSC at each other. It was just messy all around, so JSMxLKS didn't even stand out. I just only remembered that one comment. \n\nAnyways, we missed out on a lot more kwangMin between episodes 525-until his departure. I don't care about their personal lives, as in, why they seemed weird, I just hope whatever it was they worked it out and if not they can move on. We got so many great kwangMin moments to look back on and it's easy enough to pretend not to see them being weird. Kind of. I mean I know it's there but I forget. They're professionals is all I'm saying.",

If you talk about your feelings towards a guest or member or a joke or a scenario, you're too much. \n\nI'd say just ban posting on this subreddit all together. Nothing is allowed here and everything is taken way too seriously and is looked down upon. What in the world is the purpose of having a discussion forum if no topic is allowed for discussion?",

But anything anyone says aside from those people who were actually there is going to be speculation! We just have to trust that if either of them had done something unspeakable or bad, that the others wouldn't have stayed friends with them. So it's at least safe to say that whatever happened between them is private and doesn't affect other people, so it really isn't anybody's business. \n\nDoes it suck? Yes.

She just happened to go up on stage with Soran. I don't think it was official kingkong business, just SoMin having fun in her free time. \n\nShe is one of the best actresses around.

That whole episode everyone seemed tense though; like Haha actually looked super mad at SJH for blowing/not blowing a whistle and LKS looked mad at YSC and haha and YSC at each other. It was just messy all around, so JSMxLKS didn't even stand out. I just only remembered that one comment. \n\nAnyways, we missed out on a lot more kwangMin between episodes 525-until his departure. I don't care about their personal lives, as in, why they seemed weird, I just hope whatever it was they worked it out and if not they can move on. We got so many great kwangMin moments to look back on and it's easy enough to pretend not to see them being weird. Kind of. I mean I know it's there but I forget.

It isn't in our minds either. Just because you didn't feel it, doesn't mean you're right. Many sensed it. We're not starting rumours and we're not making up lies. So I don't understand your concern here. I detailed several reasons why JSM's name is brought up here all of which are valid points. She is in this agency, this is a RM sub and many expected to see her in this lineup. So it's only natural that people wonder why she isn't there. \n\nHonestly, at this point we can't talk about anything! This entire sub is just supposed to be what exactly? If you praise someone, you get called cringe. If you criticize someone, you're a hater. If you post pictures and content you're spamming. If you talk about your feelings towards a guest or member or a joke or a scenario, you're too much. \n\nI'd say just ban posting on this subreddit all together. Nothing is allowed here and everything is taken way too seriously and is looked down upon. What in the world is the purpose of having a discussion forum if no topic is allowed for discussion?",

Just one incident wouldn't be odd, it wouldn't stick out. But a few things happening definitely is kind of strange to say the least. But anything anyone says aside from those people who were actually there is going to be speculation! We just have to trust that if either of them had done something unspeakable or bad, that the others wouldn't have stayed friends with them. So it's at least safe to say that whatever happened between them is private and doesn't affect other people, so it really isn't anybody's business. \n\nDoes it suck? Yes. As a huge kwangMin fan (not shipper) it really does. I miss them rolling around on the floor wrestling over a hint. But oh well. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAnd I don't know anything about the agency. I do know she didn't do a music show, it was just a festival and she attended last year too. She just happened to go up on stage with Soran. I don't think it was official kingkong business, just SoMin having fun in her free time. \n\nShe is one of the best actresses around. She just won a best actress award at the drama awards. Any agency would be lucky to have her. I don't think they'll let her go easily.",

They literally stopped talking and reacting to each other and they almost never teamed up or partnered up after episode 525ish. In 524, they had a physical fight with the touch-counter vests and I think it was just a weird mood on set with everyone else standing around watching these two fight and not even laughing or interfering; and at one point I think KJK even said \"they're acting on real feelings\". That whole episode everyone seemed tense though; like Haha actually looked super mad at SJH for blowing/not blowing a whistle and LKS looked mad at YSC and haha and YSC at each other. It was just messy all around, so JSMxLKS didn't even stand out. I just only remembered that one comment. \n\nAnyways, we missed out on a lot more kwangMin between episodes 525-until his departure. I don't care about their personal lives, as in, why they seemed weird, I just hope whatever it was they worked it out and if not they can move on. We got so many great kwangMin moments to look back on and it's easy enough to pretend not to see them being weird. Kind of. I mean I know it's there but I forget. They're professionals is all I'm saying.",

It isn't in our minds either. Just because you didn't feel it, doesn't mean you're right. Many sensed it. We're not starting rumours and we're not making up lies. So I don't understand your concern here. I detailed several reasons why JSM's name is brought up here all of which are valid points. She is in this agency, this is a RM sub and many expected to see her in this lineup. So it's only natural that people wonder why she isn't there. \n\nHonestly, at this point we can't talk about anything! This entire sub is just supposed to be what exactly? If you praise someone, you get called cringe. If you criticize someone, you're a hater. If you post pictures and content you're spamming. If you talk about your feelings towards a guest or member or a joke or a scenario, you're too much. \n\nI'd say just ban posting on this subreddit all together. Nothing is allowed here and everything is taken way too seriously and is looked down upon. What in the world is the purpose of having a discussion forum if no topic is allowed for discussion?",

Just one incident wouldn't be odd, it wouldn't stick out. But a few things happening definitely is kind of strange to say the least. But anything anyone says aside from those people who were actually there is going to be speculation! We just have to trust that if either of them had done something unspeakable or bad, that the others wouldn't have stayed friends with them. So it's at least safe to say that whatever happened between them is private and doesn't affect other people, so it really isn't anybody's business. \n\nDoes it suck? Yes. As a huge kwangMin fan (not shipper) it really does. I miss them rolling around on the floor wrestling over a hint. But oh well. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAnd I don't know anything about the agency. I do know she didn't do a music show, it was just a festival and she attended last year too. She just happened to go up on stage with Soran. I don't think it was official kingkong business, just SoMin having fun in her free time. \n\nShe is one of the best actresses around. She just won a best actress award at the drama awards. Any agency would be lucky to have her. I don't think they'll let her go easily.",

She is in this agency, this is a RM sub and many expected to see her in this lineup. So it's only natural that people wonder why she isn't there. \n\nHonestly, at this point we can't talk about anything! This entire sub is just supposed to be what exactly? If you praise someone, you get called cringe. If you criticize someone, you're a hater. If you post pictures and content you're spamming. If you talk about your feelings towards a guest or member or a joke or a scenario, you're too much. \n\nI'd say just ban posting on this subreddit all together.
