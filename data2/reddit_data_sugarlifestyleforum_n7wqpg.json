    "body": "To the dress that is. Lol. My SB is absolutely amazing! She makes me smile, she confides in me, she never asks for ANYTHING extra beyond our agreed ppm. We only see each other on average twice a month ,so it just makes it that much better that she has this humble vibe to her. \nSo that being said I always try and listen to her carefully when we talk or chat and try and find ways to go above and for her. \nOk a little back story. She's in an open relationship and has been for a few years now. Her boyfriend knows of me and has been home on a few occasions where I have picked her up. When we made our agreement we made some ground rules that the three of us all said yes to and so far its worked out fantastic.\nAnyways a couple months into our arrangement he popped the question and she was telling me all about it and just gushing on and on. Normally we don't talk about their relationship, not because I refuse it or something like that, she has just said she wants to keep our time together ours and their time theirs. She was so happy that day I couldn't do anything but just smile at seeing her glow like that. \nWell fast forward a little and especially after hearing her talk about getting a dress online or second hand!! I was like HELL NO! So today she went with her bridesmaids and got her dream dress as my gift to her. She sent me pics and I have to say she looks like and absolute princess. Her smile made me tear up a little, in a good way that is. The wedding is next year but I figure that this is one less burden on her shoulders.",
