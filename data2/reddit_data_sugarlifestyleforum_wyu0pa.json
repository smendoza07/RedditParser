            "body": "My wife was fabulous in all respects, including in bed. I like variety, and our sex life had more variations than if I'd been dating 20 different women. I didn't cheat once, never even seriously considered it despite frequent opportunities. That lasted almost 30 years - until a drunk driver ended our marriage. We raised several kids together, and having kids didn't interfere enough to matter. She'd wake me up for sex if we'd gone a couple days without, whether because of the kids or for any other reason. She was beautiful, frequently mistaken for a well-known beauty queen, but that was not a big factor. \"Stay hot\" is nice but far less important than you might think. What mattered was that all my sexual, emotional, and social needs and desires were met by her.\n\nIf you don't want your husband to find an SB, make sure you are already the SB he would dream of. You've got his attention early in the relationship, so you can figure out how to do that if you make the choice to keep his attention. That won't work for all men, but it does for a lot of us. If you're a SB, you have already proven you know how to make that work in the bedroom, which makes it immeasurably easier to be successful in the rest of your marriage. You just have to make that choice - and find a man who will be happy with a great sex life at home.\n\nBTW, I appreciated her and tried to make as big an effort to be a great husband in all respects as she made to be a great wife.",

And an active refusal to go back to marriage counseling, because she did not like that the marriage counselor told her she really should be doing more for the marriage and not just for herself.\n\nMarriage takes commitment not just at the beginning but every day. Do you have a clear understanding of what each others\u2019 needs are? Do you *both* consciously work to help make your partner happier every day?\n\nI love to cook. She wouldn\u2019t let me cook for seven years of marriage because she didn\u2019t like the fact that there were dirty pots in the sink afterwards. I love to buy flowers for a woman. She wouldn\u2019t let me buy flowers because she told me that when she looked at them she just saw them dying.\n\nI agree with the comment about having frequent sex. Maybe it\u2019s minimally once a week and not once a month but that\u2019s going to vary for everybody. The important thing is not let your bedroom die once you have kids, if you have kids. And it\u2019s easy let it die once you have kids. Our last year of marriage we had sex exactly 0 times.\n\nI agree with the other comment about how not everyone is habitually monogamous but that doesn\u2019t have to be the end of the marriage if that lifestyle works for you. It is important that you and your spouse have compatible values on this topic. If you like the swinger lifestyle, let your freak flag fly. I would\u2019ve been happy with one woman having sex with me once a week or even every other week because I loved her. Sex was a symptom, not a root cause.",

I knew she just wanted to shop for someone to take her side.\n\nWe'd tried various things, but old habits are hard to break. She was bratty and toxic, she told me she was that way with her parents growing up, she treated me like a roommate with very infrequent, occasional benefits. She had checked out during sex, rare as it was, and wasn't playful, flirty or even friendly. She hated being touched, even by me, and I'm a touch love language. I ran a side business and all I heard about was what was in it for her, how much can I give to her, etc.\n\nSo, one day I started looking around and discovered sugar dating. I broke it off with her before I got into sugar dating, but we still lived together. She tried love bombing me for a time, but I knew there was much better out there. Even with the few dates I had before I met with my SB-turned-gf, I knew there were people out there with much more willingness to pay attention and put effort in (even if it was because they were being rewarded).\n\nHow do you prevent a husband from being an SD? I can't speak for everyone obviously, but in my case, had my spouse been a bit more intentional, genuine, affectionate, and attentive -- and not just after I told her we were done -- I likely never would have bothered exploring sugar dating.",

My relationship with my adult children is strained largely because I left their mother for a younger more sexual woman and the mother also poisoned me. My second LT relationship ended after 10 years and then I discovered sugar babies and became very spoiled by young beautiful women. Now I\u2019ve got the best of both worlds, a committed LT partnership with an intelligent, very sexy, young woman (who is adored by my family) and FWBs on the side for variety. My challenge now is to hang on to it as I get older and eventually retire.\n\nIt\u2019s good in that it sounds like your ex has accepted that you need to be with other women and nice that friendship with her is an option. \n\nAs this post suggests, long-term relationships and reliable, exciting sex is almost mutually exclusive. That\u2019s why ENM is attractive to me because there is an opportunity to have your cake and eat it too :)",

Granted, it wasn't just about fear of cheating - but the idea of a marriage lasting long term.  \n\nI realize families are different.  In my family - looking at the extended family on both sides (I'm an only child), there are 2 long term, happy marriages, that not involved any cheating that I'm aware of.  There are 2 more long term marriages that have involved cheating.  \n\nAnd about 15-20 divorces, and another 5-10 marriages that are < 10 years.\n\nThe odds told me \"no fucking way\".\n\nTo your overall question - the one possibility of course is an Open marriage.",

Women need more 'mental' stimulation to get in the mood, and that is getting harder and harder with the same old partner, in the same old situation, in the same family life, and with the same daily life troubles. Kids will speed up that process, but I am not sure not having them will 'save' your sex life.\n\nSo yes, maybe -*MAYBE!*\\- having sex with him everyday will keep *certain* men from cheating, but it will soon turn into a chore for you, and I wonder how many women will be able to do that for a lifetime. Having sex against your will just to please your partner could easily turn into despising him.\n\nAnd than of course there are people who just want the novelty, the variation, the chase, and they will cheat nevertheless. And the more money they have, the easier it is to accommodate cheating, and the more opportunities present themselves.\n\nSo, sorry to say this as an (x) wife and SB who has been on both sides,  I am afraid the only real solution would be a consensual, open marriage. It is just impossible to keep both monogamous partners sexually interested, happy, and satisfied, for a life time.",

What anyone else thinks does not matter you make each other happy and prioritize each other and the rest of the world (other than your kids) need to be ignored.\n\nFinally, make each other feel appreciated and forgiven. We are all broken in some ways, let them know you know they work hard, you appreciate their efforts, and you can forgive their mistakes (we all make them). Everything takes work, nothing is free. When I start to feel like being used or taken advantage of as a \u201cwalking wallet\u201d I get angry and frustrated and look for other options.\n\nTheir is only no magic answer to make it all work, but that is the best suggestion I could make.

            "body": "How to keep a man from cheating-\n\nThe TL; DR is keep his stomach full and his balls empty.\n\nGoing several steps beyond the TLDR-\n\nKeep dating your husband after you get married.  A surprising number of women have an attitude of \u2018I don\u2019t have to do That anymore, I\u2019m married!\u2019  In essence, they doesn\u2019t have to try and put effort in because she\u2019s got her man locked down.  Don\u2019t fall into that trap.  \n\nKeep learning and growing as an individual; don\u2019t be his shadow and lose your own identity.  Keep your own interests and stay interesting to him.  It\u2019s part of a concept called Differentiation.\n\nLove yourself.  Don\u2019t get hung up on your imperfections.  Work at staying fit but understand that I\u2019m not telling you to be a gym bunny or try to look like a model.  I\u2019m telling you to stay in a place that you like and accept who you see in the mirror.  That\u2019s a sliding scale.  A dear friend told me that she loves and accepts herself more now, at 170 lbs, than she did when she got married and weighed 120 lbs.  For years she felt unattractive and she couldn\u2019t accept that her husband still found her attractive, and she pushed him away for years.  Love yourself and let him love you.\n\nLearn his Love Languages and speak to him in them.\n\nDon\u2019t let the bedroom fall into a rut; bring up things you\u2019d like to try and don\u2019t give an automatic No to things he wants to try that are outside of your comfort zone.  Your comfort zone is elastic, and you may find yourself really enjoying experiences that a year ago you would have said \u2018WTF?\u2019 to a few years ago.\n\nUnderstand that men\u2019s primary bonding occurs through sexual intimacy.  That\u2019s how many men build connection.\n\nMonogamy isn\u2019t for everyone; polyamory and non-monogamy aren\u2019t either.  Here\u2019s the hard part; people are not necessarily going to stay at the same point on the spectrum their whole lives.  Talk about it.  My wife and my two SGFs are CLOSE.  They regularly go to lunch, and my SGFs frequently ask her for advice and not just about me.  A decade ago I would have laughed if someone had said this is where we would be, and going here was not my idea.\n\nDon\u2019t ever let a problem be a Me vs You; work at keeping everything an Us vs It.\n\nAddress serious issues early.  Don\u2019t ever let problems fester while you both avoid talking about it.\n\nI can\u2019t over stress the importance of communication.\n\nLet your husband Love you; respect your husband.\n\nHere\u2019s a few books to read that will help you in your relationships-\n\nPassionate Marriage- Schnarch;\nIntimacy and Desire- Schnarch; \nMating in Captivity- Perel; \nThe State of Affairs- Perel; \nSex Without Stress- Zimmerman; \nCupid\u2019s Poisoned Arrow- Robinson; \nLove and Respect- Eggerichs; \nTell Me What You Want- Lehmiller; \nCome As You Are- Nagoski; \nPassionista- Kerner\n\nPerel has several TED talks that are highly recommended.\n\nJennifer Finlayson-Fife has a course for women called The Art of Desire; she\u2019s LDS but her course work is applicable to anyone.  Her men\u2019s course is called The Art of Loving.  Both are money well spent, and taking them is MUCH cheaper than paying a marriage counselor.\n\nGood luck, and don\u2019t ever give up hope.",

Also, there's just more excitement in the \"new\". No man will stay loyal to you because you are hot.\n\nHaving kids makes it less likely he will stray, not more. Research shows this. Men's biochemistry actually changes when we take on paternal roles, with a lower testosterone level being one of the bigger changes.\n\nI was a loyal husband while I was married. However, it was a fairly constant effort on my part to stay that way. I did not socialize with any women at all. I communicated with the women I worked with only in a professional manner. I wouldn't allow women in my tabletop gaming groups (unless they were accompanying their bf/husband). Etc.\n\nI behaved this way because my wife was a very good woman and did not deserve to have me betray her, not because of any virtue of my own. I was also very happily married. I knew that I would easily stray if I gave myself the opportunity, so I just didn't allow any opportunity to arise. I stayed loyal because my family deserved that from me.\n\nIMO, if you want to have a good man, you need to be worthy of that good man.",

He will eventually get caught and when he does he will leave you. \n\nSo which one would you prefer? \n\nGuys sugar because they are BORED. Not because they hate their wives.

You will see many marriages end after four years. I know everyone doesn\u2019t have kids right away now\u2014 but in the past that is usually why people pair bonded. And the male was protective of his wife and offspring until he was certain they would survive. \n\nThere is also a gene mutation that makes it more likely a man will cheat. In the future, you may be able to have a POT husband take a genetics test that tells you if he has this mutation. Is that ethical? Who knows. \n\nAs a woman who has many male friends and is also an SB, I\u2019d say the majority of women and men cheat because they don\u2019t feel desired by their spouse or never had an intense chemistry to begin with.",

When asked about why was she on SA she said that she wanted to find a relationship where the man takes care of his woman, traditional roles etc. and she was sick of (and I quote) finding guys on Tinder who just want to fuck for a coffee.\n\nWell, we started going out, caught feelings and eventually moved to vanilla, because at that point it just made so more sense. I still take care of her (actually more than before) and she treats me in such a way that I don\u2019t really feel the need to get anything a girlfriend could give me from another chick and I am genuinely happy and feeling very lucky to have her in my life.\n\nI believe that, in my case, part of it is about having matching expectations about what we want from a relationship and how to behave in it and part is that, well, we started as SB and SD so we have been super clear as from the beginning about what we can give and what we expect to receive reciprocally.\n\nSo, last bit is: when you find somebody to settle with (which thing doesn\u2019t need to happen in SA of course), make it sure you know in detail what he expects/likes/wants and make it sure to give it like you were his SB (of course make it sure he very well knows how to treat you etc., as having lived the lifestyle tends to raise the bar a bit).\n\nMy two cents hoping it may be helpful.

I knew she just wanted to shop for someone to take her side.\n\nWe'd tried various things, but old habits are hard to break. She was bratty and toxic, she told me she was that way with her parents growing up, she treated me like a roommate with very infrequent, occasional benefits. She had checked out during sex, rare as it was, and wasn't playful, flirty or even friendly. She hated being touched, even by me, and I'm a touch love language. I ran a side business and all I heard about was what was in it for her, how much can I give to her, etc.\n\nSo, one day I started looking around and discovered sugar dating. I broke it off with her before I got into sugar dating, but we still lived together. She tried love bombing me for a time, but I knew there was much better out there. Even with the few dates I had before I met with my SB-turned-gf, I knew there were people out there with much more willingness to pay attention and put effort in (even if it was because they were being rewarded).\n\nHow do you prevent a husband from being an SD? I can't speak for everyone obviously, but in my case, had my spouse been a bit more intentional, genuine, affectionate, and attentive -- and not just after I told her we were done -- I likely never would have bothered exploring sugar dating.",

Statistically, women\u2019s libido tends to increase and men\u2019s decrease over the period that men most complain about not getting sex. So drive isn\u2019t the issue.\n\nSo, yes, I would look for someone, as a woman, who listens and cares. I would find them more attractive, and easier to solve things with.

My relationship with my adult children is strained largely because I left their mother for a younger more sexual woman and the mother also poisoned me. My second LT relationship ended after 10 years and then I discovered sugar babies and became very spoiled by young beautiful women. Now I\u2019ve got the best of both worlds, a committed LT partnership with an intelligent, very sexy, young woman (who is adored by my family) and FWBs on the side for variety. My challenge now is to hang on to it as I get older and eventually retire.\n\nIt\u2019s good in that it sounds like your ex has accepted that you need to be with other women and nice that friendship with her is an option. \n\nAs this post suggests, long-term relationships and reliable, exciting sex is almost mutually exclusive. That\u2019s why ENM is attractive to me because there is an opportunity to have your cake and eat it too :)",

Now I\u2019ve got the best of both worlds, a committed LT partnership with an intelligent, very sexy, young woman (who is adored by my family) and FWBs on the side for variety. My challenge now is to hang on to it as I get older and eventually retire.\n\nIt\u2019s good in that it sounds like your ex has accepted that you need to be with other women and nice that friendship with her is an option. \n\nAs this post suggests, long-term relationships and reliable, exciting sex is almost mutually exclusive. That\u2019s why ENM is attractive to me because there is an opportunity to have your cake and eat it too :)",

People define cheating differently. \n\nHowever, it doesn\u2019t matter what you do outside the marriage if you feel you are cheating or guilty, you probably can\u2019t pass your own moral judgement anyway. \n\nPersonally I think actions speak louder. Everyone experience urges, desires, emotions, do you have to act on it all the time? \n\nBeing able to control one\u2019s emotions is maturity and EQ. That\u2019s why when a kid can\u2019t get candy, he rolls around on the floor of the supermarket but you don\u2019t. You know how disappointed and shitty you feel, but you still know the right thing to do. You aren\u2019t a kid, you are a man. \n\nCheating is never something I appreciate. I hate people not respecting my time. If you are done, I\u2019d prefer you to tell me and so we can both move on, but if you cheat and at the same time, try to trap me in an unhappy relationship, you are really an arsehole.",

Statistically, women\u2019s libido tends to increase and men\u2019s decrease over the period that men most complain about not getting sex. So drive isn\u2019t the issue.\n\nSo, yes, I would look for someone, as a woman, who listens and cares. I would find them more attractive, and easier to solve things with.

That\u2019s why when a kid can\u2019t get candy, he rolls around on the floor of the supermarket but you don\u2019t. You know how disappointed and shitty you feel, but you still know the right thing to do. You aren\u2019t a kid, you are a man. \n\nCheating is never something I appreciate. I hate people not respecting my time. If you are done, I\u2019d prefer you to tell me and so we can both move on, but if you cheat and at the same time, try to trap me in an unhappy relationship, you are really an arsehole.",

A partner should be supportive and want the person they are with to have the best life possible. I don't understand why you would want to limit the one you love. \n\nBasically if you are with an average joe, and he goes out of his way to sleep with other women behind your back, he's the asshole. If you are with the guy who invented the air fryer, let him enjoy the attention and pleasure that his success has earned him, and be happy to be his main girl. You're in the wrong if you try to control him and prevent him from reaping the fruits of his labor.",
