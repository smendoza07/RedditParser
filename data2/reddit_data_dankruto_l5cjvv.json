If push comes to shove, there will be few people who could defeat Sakura to get to Sarada. The same cannot be said for Karin. \n\nFor the purpose of restoring the Uchiha clan, I think protecting the child is the priority. Not to say a Uchiha/Uzumaki hybrid wouldn't be cool, just that its not necessary for restoring the Uchiha clan. \n\nI mean sure Karin is a pure blood Uzumaki, but she's chunin, maybe jonin level at best. Sakura is above Kage level. I know who I'd pick to have a child with.",

Sasuke had gone insane and was blinded by revenge. It's pretty clear this sasuke is very different from the sasuke we get at the end of the series. Seeing what can happen when people grow up alone and abandoned is why sakura started a orphanage in the first place.\n\n\nAlso what do you mean \"I doubt she would've lasted long\". It's not like she was gonna be his partner at that point.\n\n\n\n>Also the whole I'm going to kill the five kage including your mentor and I genjustu you into thinking I killed you.\n\nAgain, sasuke wasn't thinking straight here. He wanted to create a world where people wouldn't have to suffer like he did and believed the only way through a revolution if the world. Obviously he was wrong, but it's not like he was just being a psycho murderer. Also, he genjutsued her because she would've followed him and naruto and he wanted to fight naruto alone.\n\n\n\n>No where near enough that would encourage love. \n\nYou can say that for anyone else tho. Naruto is about the plot/action. There's little romantic development at all with anyone. Naruto shows basically 0 development with hinata until the movie. \n\n\n\nYou also have to remember, sasuke doesn't really show emotions well. Even the little things he does are pretty big since we don't get much emotions from him. You also have to remember that sasuke and sakura are the last to technically come together out of all the ships in the series. Sasuke literally spent years reflecting before he came back",

Like I said, they didn't get together right away.\n\n>Not really Naruto and Sakura actually have a very fleshed out relationship and one that would have created a believable love story had Kishi not made the last minute changes. \n\nThat's true. However, I always felt Naruto and sakura had a very sibling like relationship but they are definitely very fleshed out. \n\n>She was trying get to change his mind not fight alongside him.\n\nIf ur talking about the 5 kage summit that's not what happened. Sakura went there to kill sasuke cuz she knew he was too far gone. Sasuke also isn't an idiot. He knows that while sakura likes him, she's not going to put him about the village. The only reason sakura could be there is to kill him",

If push comes to shove, there will be few people who could defeat Sakura to get to Sarada. The same cannot be said for Karin. \n\nFor the purpose of restoring the Uchiha clan, I think protecting the child is the priority. Not to say a Uchiha/Uzumaki hybrid wouldn't be cool, just that its not necessary for restoring the Uchiha clan. \n\nI mean sure Karin is a pure blood Uzumaki, but she's chunin, maybe jonin level at best. Sakura is above Kage level. I know who I'd pick to have a child with.",

Sasuke had gone insane and was blinded by revenge. It's pretty clear this sasuke is very different from the sasuke we get at the end of the series. Seeing what can happen when people grow up alone and abandoned is why sakura started a orphanage in the first place.\n\n\nAlso what do you mean \"I doubt she would've lasted long\". It's not like she was gonna be his partner at that point.\n\n\n\n>Also the whole I'm going to kill the five kage including your mentor and I genjustu you into thinking I killed you.\n\nAgain, sasuke wasn't thinking straight here. He wanted to create a world where people wouldn't have to suffer like he did and believed the only way through a revolution if the world. Obviously he was wrong, but it's not like he was just being a psycho murderer. Also, he genjutsued her because she would've followed him and naruto and he wanted to fight naruto alone.\n\n\n\n>No where near enough that would encourage love. \n\nYou can say that for anyone else tho. Naruto is about the plot/action. There's little romantic development at all with anyone. Naruto shows basically 0 development with hinata until the movie. \n\n\n\nYou also have to remember, sasuke doesn't really show emotions well. Even the little things he does are pretty big since we don't get much emotions from him. You also have to remember that sasuke and sakura are the last to technically come together out of all the ships in the series. Sasuke literally spent years reflecting before he came back",

If push comes to shove, there will be few people who could defeat Sakura to get to Sarada. The same cannot be said for Karin. \n\nFor the purpose of restoring the Uchiha clan, I think protecting the child is the priority. Not to say a Uchiha/Uzumaki hybrid wouldn't be cool, just that its not necessary for restoring the Uchiha clan. \n\nI mean sure Karin is a pure blood Uzumaki, but she's chunin, maybe jonin level at best. Sakura is above Kage level. I know who I'd pick to have a child with.",

Sasuke had gone insane and was blinded by revenge. It's pretty clear this sasuke is very different from the sasuke we get at the end of the series. Seeing what can happen when people grow up alone and abandoned is why sakura started a orphanage in the first place.\n\n\nAlso what do you mean \"I doubt she would've lasted long\". It's not like she was gonna be his partner at that point.\n\n\n\n>Also the whole I'm going to kill the five kage including your mentor and I genjustu you into thinking I killed you.\n\nAgain, sasuke wasn't thinking straight here. He wanted to create a world where people wouldn't have to suffer like he did and believed the only way through a revolution if the world. Obviously he was wrong, but it's not like he was just being a psycho murderer. Also, he genjutsued her because she would've followed him and naruto and he wanted to fight naruto alone.\n\n\n\n>No where near enough that would encourage love. \n\nYou can say that for anyone else tho. Naruto is about the plot/action. There's little romantic development at all with anyone. Naruto shows basically 0 development with hinata until the movie. \n\n\n\nYou also have to remember, sasuke doesn't really show emotions well. Even the little things he does are pretty big since we don't get much emotions from him. You also have to remember that sasuke and sakura are the last to technically come together out of all the ships in the series. Sasuke literally spent years reflecting before he came back",

However, I always felt Naruto and sakura had a very sibling like relationship but they are definitely very fleshed out. \n\n>She was trying get to change his mind not fight alongside him.\n\nIf ur talking about the 5 kage summit that's not what happened. Sakura went there to kill sasuke cuz she knew he was too far gone. Sasuke also isn't an idiot. He knows that while sakura likes him, she's not going to put him about the village. The only reason sakura could be there is to kill him",

If push comes to shove, there will be few people who could defeat Sakura to get to Sarada. The same cannot be said for Karin. \n\nFor the purpose of restoring the Uchiha clan, I think protecting the child is the priority. Not to say a Uchiha/Uzumaki hybrid wouldn't be cool, just that its not necessary for restoring the Uchiha clan. \n\nI mean sure Karin is a pure blood Uzumaki, but she's chunin, maybe jonin level at best. Sakura is above Kage level. I know who I'd pick to have a child with.",

Sasuke had gone insane and was blinded by revenge. It's pretty clear this sasuke is very different from the sasuke we get at the end of the series. Seeing what can happen when people grow up alone and abandoned is why sakura started a orphanage in the first place.\n\n\nAlso what do you mean \"I doubt she would've lasted long\". It's not like she was gonna be his partner at that point.\n\n\n\n>Also the whole I'm going to kill the five kage including your mentor and I genjustu you into thinking I killed you.\n\nAgain, sasuke wasn't thinking straight here. He wanted to create a world where people wouldn't have to suffer like he did and believed the only way through a revolution if the world. Obviously he was wrong, but it's not like he was just being a psycho murderer. Also, he genjutsued her because she would've followed him and naruto and he wanted to fight naruto alone.\n\n\n\n>No where near enough that would encourage love. \n\nYou can say that for anyone else tho. Naruto is about the plot/action. There's little romantic development at all with anyone. Naruto shows basically 0 development with hinata until the movie. \n\n\n\nYou also have to remember, sasuke doesn't really show emotions well. Even the little things he does are pretty big since we don't get much emotions from him. You also have to remember that sasuke and sakura are the last to technically come together out of all the ships in the series. Sasuke literally spent years reflecting before he came back",

However, I always felt Naruto and sakura had a very sibling like relationship but they are definitely very fleshed out. \n\n>She was trying get to change his mind not fight alongside him.\n\nIf ur talking about the 5 kage summit that's not what happened. Sakura went there to kill sasuke cuz she knew he was too far gone. Sasuke also isn't an idiot. He knows that while sakura likes him, she's not going to put him about the village. The only reason sakura could be there is to kill him",

If push comes to shove, there will be few people who could defeat Sakura to get to Sarada. The same cannot be said for Karin. \n\nFor the purpose of restoring the Uchiha clan, I think protecting the child is the priority. Not to say a Uchiha/Uzumaki hybrid wouldn't be cool, just that its not necessary for restoring the Uchiha clan. \n\nI mean sure Karin is a pure blood Uzumaki, but she's chunin, maybe jonin level at best.

Sasuke had gone insane and was blinded by revenge. It's pretty clear this sasuke is very different from the sasuke we get at the end of the series. Seeing what can happen when people grow up alone and abandoned is why sakura started a orphanage in the first place.\n\n\nAlso what do you mean \"I doubt she would've lasted long\". It's not like she was gonna be his partner at that point.\n\n\n\n>Also the whole I'm going to kill the five kage including your mentor and I genjustu you into thinking I killed you.\n\nAgain, sasuke wasn't thinking straight here. He wanted to create a world where people wouldn't have to suffer like he did and believed the only way through a revolution if the world. Obviously he was wrong, but it's not like he was just being a psycho murderer. Also, he genjutsued her because she would've followed him and naruto and he wanted to fight naruto alone.\n\n\n\n>No where near enough that would encourage love. \n\nYou can say that for anyone else tho. Naruto is about the plot/action. There's little romantic development at all with anyone. Naruto shows basically 0 development with hinata until the movie. \n\n\n\nYou also have to remember, sasuke doesn't really show emotions well. Even the little things he does are pretty big since we don't get much emotions from him. You also have to remember that sasuke and sakura are the last to technically come together out of all the ships in the series. Sasuke literally spent years reflecting before he came back",

However, I always felt Naruto and sakura had a very sibling like relationship but they are definitely very fleshed out. \n\n>She was trying get to change his mind not fight alongside him.\n\nIf ur talking about the 5 kage summit that's not what happened. Sakura went there to kill sasuke cuz she knew he was too far gone. Sasuke also isn't an idiot. He knows that while sakura likes him, she's not going to put him about the village. The only reason sakura could be there is to kill him",

Sasuke had gone insane and was blinded by revenge. It's pretty clear this sasuke is very different from the sasuke we get at the end of the series. Seeing what can happen when people grow up alone and abandoned is why sakura started a orphanage in the first place.\n\n\nAlso what do you mean \"I doubt she would've lasted long\". It's not like she was gonna be his partner at that point.\n\n\n\n>Also the whole I'm going to kill the five kage including your mentor and I genjustu you into thinking I killed you.\n\nAgain, sasuke wasn't thinking straight here. He wanted to create a world where people wouldn't have to suffer like he did and believed the only way through a revolution if the world. Obviously he was wrong, but it's not like he was just being a psycho murderer. Also, he genjutsued her because she would've followed him and naruto and he wanted to fight naruto alone.\n\n\n\n>No where near enough that would encourage love. \n\nYou can say that for anyone else tho. Naruto is about the plot/action. There's little romantic development at all with anyone. Naruto shows basically 0 development with hinata until the movie. \n\n\n\nYou also have to remember, sasuke doesn't really show emotions well. Even the little things he does are pretty big since we don't get much emotions from him. You also have to remember that sasuke and sakura are the last to technically come together out of all the ships in the series. Sasuke literally spent years reflecting before he came back",

            "body": ">5 Kate sumit Arc Sauske was insane, given how he treated Sugesitu, Jugo, and Karin I doubt Sakura would have lasted long.\n\nThat's kind of my point. Sasuke had gone insane and was blinded by revenge. It's pretty clear this sasuke is very different from the sasuke we get at the end of the series. Seeing what can happen when people grow up alone and abandoned is why sakura started a orphanage in the first place.\n\n\nAlso what do you mean \"I doubt she would've lasted long\". It's not like she was gonna be his partner at that point.\n\n\n\n>Also the whole I'm going to kill the five kage including your mentor and I genjustu you into thinking I killed you.\n\nAgain, sasuke wasn't thinking straight here. He wanted to create a world where people wouldn't have to suffer like he did and believed the only way through a revolution if the world. Obviously he was wrong, but it's not like he was just being a psycho murderer. Also, he genjutsued her because she would've followed him and naruto and he wanted to fight naruto alone.\n\n\n\n>No where near enough that would encourage love. \n\nYou can say that for anyone else tho. Naruto is about the plot/action. There's little romantic development at all with anyone. Naruto shows basically 0 development with hinata until the movie. \n\n\n\nYou also have to remember, sasuke doesn't really show emotions well. Even the little things he does are pretty big since we don't get much emotions from him. You also have to remember that sasuke and sakura are the last to technically come together out of all the ships in the series. Sasuke literally spent years reflecting before he came back",
