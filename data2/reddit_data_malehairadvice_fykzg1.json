The hairs behind the chin are very short at the back, and gets progressively longer towards the front. I don't trim the sides and front. The moustache is kind of trial and error. I always used to keep it short, but ended up looking like a radicalised Muslim. This time I went the other way around, shortened the beard, but kept the moustache long. I plan on letting it grow out, then going a barber to get it tidied up.\n\nMy styling routine includes 50/50 beeswax/coconut oil in the moustache. I use avocado oil in the beard. I then use the hairdryer to mould the moustache downwards and to the sides. I lock it in with a cold blast. Same with the beard, I use hot air to mould it downwards, and cold air to set it. I'm not quite happy with how it looks, but I hope to get there eventually :)",

I always used to keep it short, but ended up looking like a radicalised Muslim. This time I went the other way around, shortened the beard, but kept the moustache long. I plan on letting it grow out, then going a barber to get it tidied up.\n\nMy styling routine includes 50/50 beeswax/coconut oil in the moustache. I use avocado oil in the beard. I then use the hairdryer to mould the moustache downwards and to the sides. I lock it in with a cold blast. Same with the beard, I use hot air to mould it downwards, and cold air to set it. I'm not quite happy with how it looks, but I hope to get there eventually :)",
