    "body": "Well I almost cried out of frustration first because I was studying in a coffee shop alone while my SD was giving me problems to do while on vacation on the other side of the world. Are you following? No? Okay, so I was studying at Starbucks in the evening by myself. My SD is still on vacation somewhere in Europe but he\u2019ll wake up early to talk to me for a while. He\u2019s in the field I\u2019m studying so he\u2019ll offer to give me practice problems, like today. \n\nWell he gave it to me and it sounded easy enough but then I couldn\u2019t do it. I was stuck on it, and literally felt like crying because it shouldn\u2019t have been that hard for me to do. It was taking me a long time and I felt dumb. I was ready to ask him to just give me the answer and explain it to me. But I knew I\u2019d feel like more of a failure if I did that. Then I managed to figure out the answer! He said I did great but I told him how I almost gave up and felt shitty about it. Then he sent me several messages about believing in myself and how much he believes in me and is proud and how smart I am. And damn, I was about to cry in the middle of the coffee shop (okay maybe a tear or two made it out in the car). These messages of encouragement kind of hit you strangely when it\u2019s not something you\u2019re used to. Growing up it was more don\u2019t do this, don\u2019t do that, it never led with positivity. \n\nAnyway, I also was awarded some passes for a conference I applied to online and he\u2019s helping me with flight + hotel. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to go otherwise. I just feel so lucky.",

            "body": "I think it is increasingly rare to have a true cheerleader in your corner.    I like to do that so I often end up with SB\u2019s that have goals their are striving for.   Students,  starting a business,  athletics,  etc.   I get turned on by women that are driven and goal oriented. I have athletic and coaching background and was blessed to play for some legendary coaches.  Obviously your coach or mentor a SB differently but it\u2019s very rewarding.  \n\n\nI have a lot of stuff that seems to be valuable but one of my prized possessions is a T shirt that my favorite Sugar baby made for me to wear to her graduation.   It says \u201cAggie Daddie\u201d in college script with the school colors in my size.  I didn\u2019t cry when she gave it to me but I welled up with pride.    When we met she was a sophomore on the verge of dropping out/\u201ctaking a year off\u201d for financial reasons.  Former foster kid with no support or safety net at all.  We turned that around and she made it.",

I love that because SDs are successful, many self made, they know the downs you have to go through to get to the ups. Encouragement alone is so valuable. He\u2019s definitely my cheerleader and even says how he might be working for me one day.",

A sounding board, supporter , cheerleader and when necessary , slayer of economic / social / landlord   dragons. \n\nThe point of all of this is that there's often a great opportunity for both when the SD can be a sounding board and cheerleader without being paternalistic.",
