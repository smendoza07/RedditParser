Most likely, whatever you did with your life, you did everything the best way you could. You could be lazy, you could be cowardly, you could be ignorant - but hell, it's not like you approach every challenge in your life with a mindset to deliberately ruin it. E.g. being lazy is just a combination of you being a mammal with you being stressed, anxious or overloaded. \n\n2. Our 'inner codex' of work&like ethics is defined but our environment and the biggest role will always be your parent (technically if you're an orphan you still suffer from the fact that your parent is not here, for whatever the reason, amirite?).\n\nAnd bear in mind: your parent is also a human being, so paragraph 1. applies to them to. Even if they fail as a parent or even they are a piece of shit, they still are the net force of their own experiences. So I don't mean to boycott the parents either. My main point is to not boycott yourself. Being your own friend is the best you can do:\n\n- don't call yourself names. Ever. Trust me on this one.\n\n- practice self-compassion. You suffer, you have your weaknesses and challenges. It's ok to fail, it's ok to cry, it's ok to feel bad, it's ok to be scared, it's ok to be lazy and tired.\n\n- visualise. Imagine hugging your shadow clones. Or younger versions of self. Or evil side of self (like in Shippuuden arc on the island where Naruto had chakra tug-o-war with Kurama before achieving chakra cloak mode). Just hug the shit out of yourself. Inside your mind.\n\n- obviously psychotherapy, if you suffer a lot or have problems with e.g. relationships, drugs, anxiety or sleeping. And bear in mind psychotherapists also are humans and pretty much can suck too, so don't give up if one therapist turns out to not be perfect for you. Seek help even more.\n\n- practice ignoring \"trying to find someone to blame\" and replacing it with \"trying to find a solution\"\n\n- don't ever compare your problems to problems of other people. Your problems are your problems, letting in the thoughts that \"someone else suffers more so I should shut up\" will help no one. And increase your chances of failing both yourself and as a parent/partner/friend too. \n\nTo sum it up: it's not your fault, if you feel that your life sucks. It's very likely your parents failure. This doesn't mean they are evil too, this just means they failed and it's ok. Humans tend to fail and hurt other beings, it's inevitable. Thing is - it's your life and only you can fix this shit. And you can, if you find the right comment on Reddit.",
