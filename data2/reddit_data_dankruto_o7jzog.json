Sasuke tells Naruto that's what it's called, but when Kurama tells him, he looks like Madara he says he's never heard of him.\n\nThat means the academy doesn't teach history class, he didn't learn it from the documents left behind by his clan, and it never came up training with Orochimaru.\n\nThat is just the tip of the iceberg. He also gave most characters a few good scenes and then they're forgotten.\n\nu/DDronewar",
