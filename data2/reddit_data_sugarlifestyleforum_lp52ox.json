    "body": "Why do some men think it\u2019s appropriate to not be recently tested when you\u2019re clearly in this lifestyle that can come with anything??? I met a nice guy and things were going well. Once we decided to start our arrangement I took all precautions so we can have stress free s*x life. Now that it\u2019s his turn all I hear from him is excuses.\n\n\u201cOh they\u2019ll send the results to my office and my staff will know.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you be okay with a home testing kit?\u201d\n\n\u201cI promise I don\u2019t take risks with my health. I\u2019m a good guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not comfortable with getting online results cause either way it\u2019ll be downloaded to my office computers and my staff will still know.\u201d\n\nOkay....why would it be a problem if they know you\u2019re having safe sex? Idgaf about home kits and i\u2019m not reading an article about the accuracy. He even admitted he just hoped I\u2019d \u201cgive in\u201d and not ask for him to be tested anymore and did a head pusher move the last time we got together. \n\nFor someone in the medical field you really don\u2019t have any self medical common sense. He just gave so many excuses and it wasn\u2019t worth it. So now I\u2019m back to looking \ud83d\ude44\n\nLadies stick to your guns. No amount of money is worth your peace of mind.",
