    "body": "My parents got separated when I was 13 because my mom found out that my dad was cheating on her. 2 years ago they finally got divorced (I m 23 years old now)\n\nI lived with my dad and when I turned 17 I moved abroad for my studies. My dad is a very kind hearted man and would do anything for his daughters (me and my sister)\n\nBut he had this habit. He would date younger women and pamper them. Buy them house, take them for trips, buy them car, money etc. He got caught by my mom when he was dating a 20 years old girl whom my mom knew. \n\nI remember that my dad hated my mom. I m using past tense here. He hated her a lot. He would tell his relatives and people he knew that my mom cheated on him and she is a disgusting women. \n\nNow, all my life I know that mom never cheated on him. Even after divorce, I told mom to start dating again and find a good man but she doesn\u2019t want to. She says \u201cI don\u2019t want to marry another man like your dad\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t blame her. If she is happy alone then I don\u2019t mind it. I just want her to be happy. My dad is 56 and married 29 years old women after divorcing my mom. My stepmom was his SB. She is a great women and she takes care of my dad so I have nothing against her and I adore her.\n\nWhy am I saying this here? Because I don\u2019t want anyone to think about their wife like how my dad did. She must be fat, she might not be willing to have sex with you so what? Not everyone is same. Just because one person loves sex and your partner don\u2019t like it anymore it doesn\u2019t mean that you have to leave her or make the relationship fade away. \n\nJust because your wife gave birth and she is no more attractive to you it doesn\u2019t mean you hate her? Remember, she carried your child in her womb for 9 months. It wasn\u2019t her decision alone. \n\nAt one point if you feel that your love for your wife has faded, go for a divorce. It\u2019s simple as that. Don\u2019t tell people bad things about her and let her live her life and you live yours.\n\nRecently, my dad got sick. He thinks that he may not survive for long. I told him to get operated and things will be fine. He said that he doesn\u2019t mind dying, but he want to apologize mom for all the wrong thing he has done and he has said. I could see regrets in his eyes. I tell him he can just apologize and it\u2019s alright, it\u2019s fine because he knew he was wrong. Although it\u2019s late and nothing will change but at least he realized it. \n\nI am a SB myself and my SD is married. I always tell him to appreciate people in his life, and never to talk bad about anyone. He once showed me his wife\u2019s picture and I told him she is very beautiful. He was happy that I said it. I m happy because he knows that his wife is beautiful.\n\nWhy am I saying this is because I know there are many married SD here. Appreciate your family, love your kids and you wife and your parents. They will only be the one who will stick with you even after you lose all the money one day. They don\u2019t love you because of your bank balance, they love you because you share a bond, a family and they love you for who you are.\n\nI mean, love your SB too. Love everyone. She is giving you companionship. But remember one day she won\u2019t be with you, it isn\u2019t permanent and she is with your for her financial support. She won\u2019t be with you if you don\u2019t have money. That\u2019s the truth everyone knows here.\n\nYour family will stay with you forever.",

She was one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen, not fat, as he claimed. We had to end our relationship. I got tired of listening about how bad his wife is every single time we met. \n\nNext time I met a recently divorced SD. He was the opposite. He told me he liked me because I reminded him of his wife in a good way. He showed her pictures and told me that he loved her. I said she's a beautiful woman (she really is), then he started talking about his child and we had a good ice-breaker for the evening. We didn't see when 5am came.

More so when the other person is a former lover/spouse, a current rival in business or even a past adversary, an old friend who is no longer a friend etc. Respectable characters are those who don\u2019t bitch about other and offer due respect to people even if they don\u2019t agree with everything they do.\nI will judge the character of an SB if she goes out of her way to bash her ex boyfriend or husband.

If you're a married SD, you probably are quite wealthy, and got all of those people into your life because of the wealth. I don't see any married SD's who work at Burger King.\n\nThe underlying tone of your message is that it's always the man's fault. I've seen many of wives cheat, or simply \"lose interest\" which causes them to withhold sex, etc.\n\nIt wasn't cool of your dad to say those things to your mom...and I get it, because I had a similar situation. But, you;re literally perpetuating the cycle that you detest. **If you don't like men cheating on their wives, why are you an sb, much less an SB dating a married dude? You said his wife was beautiful, but you never said that he should stop cheating on her?**\n\nAt the end of the day, you chose the sugar bowl because you wanted the money, regardless of who it \"hurt\".\n\nAt the end of the day, your dad chose sugar babies, regardless of who it hurt.\n\nMoral of the story - people always do things that's in their best interest, and we shouldn't bend over backwards to others unconditionally. A man who's faithful to his wife might later find out that she was banging the poolboy.",

My dad\u2019s SB (current wife) made his happy, and that\u2019s what all matters.\n\nWhat I m saying here is, be kind and respectful to your wife. I m emphasizing about man cheating because this is my story and this is what happened. I agree, women cheat as well. I didn\u2019t tell you that they don\u2019t. But because this is my story and this is about my dad, I m talking about it. \n\nThanks!",
