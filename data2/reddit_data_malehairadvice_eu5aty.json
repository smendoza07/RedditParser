Just tell them to square up both sides evenly. If you have very light hair like mine, this will probably lead to it sticking up on the parted side, so you want to apply heat and product to get it down. I put some product on mine then use the side of my hand to push it down while rapidly doing a sawing motion. Do that a few times and the friction heat sets the hair, and product keeps it there all day.\n\nI get it trimmed at a 1-4 square cut fade, and let it grow out for about 2 months until it looks about the same as this picture, maybe a little more square.\n\nBut yeah, long story short, tell your barber to square up the parted side just as long as the non-parted side.",

Just tell them to square up both sides evenly. If you have very light hair like mine, this will probably lead to it sticking up on the parted side, so you want to apply heat and product to get it down. I put some product on mine then use the side of my hand to push it down while rapidly doing a sawing motion. Do that a few times and the friction heat sets the hair, and product keeps it there all day.\n\nI get it trimmed at a 1-4 square cut fade, and let it grow out for about 2 months until it looks about the same as this picture, maybe a little more square.\n\nBut yeah, long story short, tell your barber to square up the parted side just as long as the non-parted side.",
