Sechan even explained why he didn't know by saying \"hyung, first of all old fossils can't join here lol\". After that, Haha called Jaesuk to tell him (snitch) about it but Jaesuk said he already knew since Hyungin PD told him about it \ud83d\ude02 he told him to accept the reality that he is too old to be hanging out with the maknaes and he will just make them uncomfortable \ud83d\ude02\n\nSeeing this post with Somin really shows she brings out the youth in him",
