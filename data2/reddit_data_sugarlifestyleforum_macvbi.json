    "body": "**Dear Young Daddies,**  \n\nWhat\u2019s with the huge influx of y\u2019all trying to push the narrative that SB are dying for a young Daddy, and are happy to accept less PPM? Are they teaching this shit on TERB or r/seduction?? (\ud83e\udd2e, by the way)\n\nYou\u2019re a Sugar Daddy because you like to spoil women and have them spoil you right back, right?!\n\n \u201cHi, I hear I can offer to spoil a girl less cause I\u2019m younger. Woohoo discount!!\u201d  \n*[Trump voice]\nWRONG! Fake news!!*\n\nAre you here to spoil us, or are you here to try to get some sex and no-effort emotional involvement on the cheap cheap? \n\nIf y\u2019all don\u2019t have the time, charisma, and looks to snag a vanilla girl, that\u2019s not our fault; Don\u2019t think you can come here and peddle your \u201cbut I\u2019m so young! Surely you must give me a discount\u201d bullshit. Ain\u2019t nobody got time for that. \n\n**Ladies!!**  \nPlease keep your wits about you, and *do NOT* be influenced by all the Discount Daddies using their age as an excuse to try to get your time and affection and sensuality for cheaper than average. \n\nWe\u2019re not here to be brainwashed. Those *men who supposedly love to spoil us* should NOT want to spoil us less because they\u2019re younger.",

            "body": "This is the real thing about the lifestyle; a large influx of younger SD's shouldn't be in the pool at all.  What I discovered for myself is my 120k a year and budget is actually nowhere near what I need to properly navigate the bowl.  Not a lot of guys make the average of 2k-3k disposable income required to maintain a sugar relationship.  Considering all income streams you can properly sugar when you're taking home a net of over 150k or more from ALL sources of income.  Easier said than done for most people!  Definitely need to have more financial clout than that.\n\nVast majority of girls want to start with a 500ppm. Need to really evaluate if the lifestyle is meant for you, that's why most successful SD's tend to be older, ie: matured investments, matured financial situations.  Perhaps there some younger investors who are well positioned to afford what's needed and that's great if you are in that position.\n\nFor these reasons I stepped away from the bowl myself because by the math, after paying out my bills and net remaining and what I want to invest, I can't really afford the sugar lifestyle.  I was silly to think I could, but I'm not ready for it yet, I need to invest whatever I have remaining remaining to build up my net worth and increase those income streams.  That's the only way to comfortably do this.  If that 500ppm price is taking sizeable chunks out of your day job paycheck, dude you can't afford the sugar lifestyle.  You may be well to do but not well enough for SR's.  You need way more.\n\nOther aspiring SDs need to really reevaluate the resources needed to do this.  It's not going to be cheap.  When you do the math on what you need to afford it you need a mix of high paying job and other streams making capital or successful businesses.  Just a high end job won't really cut it either.  I think that's where alot of guys confuse themselves into thinking they can afford to be an SD.  The truth is they probably need almost double or triple the income to do it properly.\n\nSo all that being said: it's not about spoiling or not wanting to spoil - really comes down to dollars and sense.  Those over 100k income guys actually can't afford the SR.  It's just not enough.  And they don't really realize it themselves.  Now if they make the right decisions with their cash NOW maybe they can afford the lifestyle at a later age.. say after 50 or so.  Until then those guys just gotta build themselves up.  And trying to find SR's while struggling to find the 500 per meet isn't going to really work.  That's what's really happening.  They need to forget the bowl for a long while and come back when they can really afford it, when those ppm costs become a small % of your net income.",

The hottest girls you see on SA already have their pick of the top 5% of guys in terms of looks if they wanted to pursue a non-serious relationship. I think the OPs perspective here is understandable, when you have your pick of so many smoking hot guys your age, an SD being closer to your age (but still like 10 years older) and kinda okay looking isn't really a draw.\n\nAlthough it is kind of unrealistic to expect young SDs to match older ones in terms of what they can offer. They just don't have the funds for it yet.",

Neither does the world become a better place when cheap men who want cheap sex use a Sugar Daddy site to act like anything but a Sugar Daddy (and usually while simultaneously spewing vitriol about sex workers).\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to say \u201clisten I\u2019ll never meet you or fuck you, but how about some engaging online banter, me making you feel  young and charming again, and some sexy pics and videos of me snapped jusssst for you? Then if the guy says yea, then great for all. \n\nOr what if the man said \u201clisten- i don\u2019t want to pretend about romance or caring about your feelings, and I won\u2019t care if you cum, either. I\u2019ve got 250. It\u2019s way less than average but if you\u2019re hard up and not totally repulsed by me, well, whaddya think? Oh ps- DONT call me a John. I don\u2019t see escorts! Ewww sex work!! I\u2019ll call you my sugar baby, okay?? Don\u2019t call me daddy though!

The money is important, but it is not the only aspect to an arrangement. It reads to me more like a sex worker annoyed that younger SDs may pay less to the SBs and therefore undercutting her. In the OP there is no real evidence that it is happening to any large scale. And even if it was, who cares what SBs are happy to accept? It's their choice. \n\nFollowing the OPs \"logic\", if SBs want more income, all SBs have to do is date older SDs. It's as if older SDs aren't capable of being splenda daddies. If the age gap is more important to the SB than the allowance, the SB may happily take a lower allowance. Many women go on Tinder and don't get allowance for hooking up with younger guys, so they get on SA and any allowance is better than Tinder. But again, who cares?\n\nAs an older SD, I have also been in arrangements, including a current one, where the SBs do NOT want an allowance at all - and this was stated by them very clearly upfront. They were seeking other things from an arrangement and were very happy it.",

Those are two very different things.  \n\nObviously - arguing with someone that they should accept less because you are younger/good looking - is pretty funny.  I never ask a POT what she wants;  I simply tell her what I'm able to offer.  If that doesn't work for her, I wish her the best and move on.  There is no negging, or manipulating.  We simply aren't a match.  \n\nI'm a younger SD.  I offer - what I'm able to offer.  Period.  It's not about offering at a discount, or the lowest offer possible.  But a balance of what I'm willing to allocate (resource wise) on sugaring vs. my own savings.  And to be blunt - I find all your posts slightly funny as you only talk about PPM.  And while I respect that PPM is the right answer in some SRs (especially those where you can't meet 100% consistently), it's not my preferred approach by any means.\n\nMy allowance is likely somewhere between splenda to average.  If you converted it into a PPM and it was 4 meets a month, it would probably be average.  I'm looking to meet more often than that.  (6-7x a month).  So if you divide the allowance out by that, its more in the Splenda area.\n\nI've never had a real issue finding an SR.",

What do they want to accomplish and we sit and make a plan to accomplish that. Sometimes it\u2019s tuition, sometimes it\u2019s to have as much fun as possible, sometimes to change their living situation. So no, it\u2019s not about money per se. It\u2019s about making a positive difference in someone else\u2019s life for the short time that I\u2019m in it. The amount I spend in an arrangement varies greatly but I always give enthusiastically. \n\nPPM at the beginning helps to set a precedent. What follows has nothing to do with how much I value their pussy.... I can get that pretty easily in the vanilla world.",
