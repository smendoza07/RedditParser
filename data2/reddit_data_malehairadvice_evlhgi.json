Any Schwartzkopf got2b paste, depends if you want textured or flat hair.\n3. Got a haircut and I've started combing my hair other way, turns out that it was a real game changer.\nSo my steps:\n\n - Blow dry on low temperature and no cosmetics. To make sure hairs will lay down easily, because if I do blow dry with any hair product on my hair, they got too flat and straight;\n\n- give your hair half arsed desired shape using paste, clay, or whatever comes handy;\n\n- use some hair spray and run your hand few times through the hair. Once you got what you wanted use more hair spray and leave it. :)",

Any Schwartzkopf got2b paste, depends if you want textured or flat hair.\n3. Got a haircut and I've started combing my hair other way, turns out that it was a real game changer.\nSo my steps:\n\n - Blow dry on low temperature and no cosmetics. To make sure hairs will lay down easily, because if I do blow dry with any hair product on my hair, they got too flat and straight;\n\n- give your hair half arsed desired shape using paste, clay, or whatever comes handy;\n\n- use some hair spray and run your hand few times through the hair. Once you got what you wanted use more hair spray and leave it. :)",
