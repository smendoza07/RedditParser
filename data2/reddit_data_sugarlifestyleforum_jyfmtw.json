    "body": "Confirm the meet an hour or two ahead off time and don't leave home unless you hear from her. Good advice; wish I'd followed it. At least there's a taco truck here \ud83d\ude42\n\nedited for outcome: she texted, overslept her alarm after studying all night. We changed the location to give her a chance to get ready and met after. Had a great time, good connection. :)  Otoh last evening another POT (who I really liked) cancelled our second meeting last minute after  we had already rescheduled it FOUR times. Little head still wants to see her but big head is done. Crushed.",

I drove two hours home from a weekend outing, got ready, dressed exactly how he said he preferred and drove to the restaurant less than five minutes from home once he\u2019d texted saying he was THERE. I\u2019d also sent him free content because this was early in my experience and I was naive. He was to pay for dinner and give me a pre-determined and agreed upon amount as an initial allowance and if it went well, we\u2019d go from there. He wasn\u2019t there. He never showed. He never texted me again. I reported him and moved on, but it surely wasn\u2019t the last time this kinda thing took place! Shitty people exist and the bowl isn\u2019t an exception to the rule. Keep looking! The good ones are out there!\n\nEdit: since several people have asked, I wasn\u2019t *demanding* anything from this POT. We agreed on an amount because I\u2019d sent him dozens of pictures, and more importantly, full length videos that I charged anybody else to receive. He convinced me he wanted to pay cash and wasn\u2019t comfortable with apps, so my naive little ass believed him and trusted he\u2019d do it. He then told me he was *at the restaurant* and we had plans of going to a hotel if things went well. I don\u2019t ever guarantee that, but it was a possibility. Then he wasn\u2019t there when I arrived. I learned a hard lesson about sending content I spend hours making to anyone without payment and it was a case of two worlds colliding (sugaring/online content creation and sales) and I made a mistake in trusting him. He ripped me off and lied to me, topping it all off by ghosting me at the meeting spot. The end! :)",

I think there is an overemphasis on preparing for the M&G in terms of dress and makeup etc and underemphasis on arriving on time, focused on the meeting and bringing a smile. \n\nYes the dress is appropriate for the location and time of day but I prefer that there is more attention to arriving focused on the meeting than with perfect nails and the perfect outfit. \n\nOn a different but related topic , \"He was to pay for dinner and give me a pre-determined and agreed upon amount as an initial allowance and if it went well, we\u2019d go from there.\"     Asking the SD to pay for the privilege of meeting (beyond a reasonable travel reimbursement) probably helps to discourage many genuine SD as it is  a flashing red light.  \n\nOn the topic of a \"fee\" for attending the M&G.....  what if you, the SB saw some shoes in the window and asked to see them.  What would your reaction to the salesperson be after hearing.... , \"of course, what size,.......  I'll need your credit card as we charge $5/pair to pull them from stock and 10% of the sales price if you want to try them on... but of course we'll credit that against your purchase.\"  \n\nIt's no different if I am interviewing an architect, contractor, property owner, attorney, prospective employee  etc.  I'm not going to pay them to meet with me unless I have asked them to prepare something specific to my project.  \n\nMy personal belief is that those who demand something to show up for a M&G (beyond reimbursement for travel and perhaps a baby sitter)  are self selecting from a lower tier of potential SD.",

There were plans for going to a hotel after the date, but that is never something I guarantee based on bad things that have happened in the past. I didn\u2019t say the amount, so you don\u2019t really have room to judge me based on that. The reason he was supposed to give me a little money was, as I\u2019d mentioned, that I\u2019d been sending him content. Lots and lots of content that, since that incident, I never send without payment now.  He owed me for it and said he preferred cash, which I agreed to, because again, I was young and naive. \n\nOn another note, your beliefs and preferences are yours and I absolutely respect them. However, in my early days I went on a dinner date with a potential SD that gave me a hefty sum just for showing up on time with a smile, and at the end of the date he said we weren\u2019t a good match, but to always remember my time was worth money and not to accept offers of free dates. Obviously, I took his advice with a grain of salt and haven\u2019t applied it to every meeting since, but it goes to show that there are SDs out there that think quite differently than you do. I\u2019ve had three long term arrangements, one of which was entirely online and one mostly so, and dozens of sugar \u201cflings\u201d that were PPM. I had a lot of fun, got a lot of financial help, and gave a LOT of time, affection and other pieces of me to those men because I search for SDs I get along with, truly enjoy talking to and spending time with and am compatible with on a friendship level at the very least. I\u2019ve met assholes, I\u2019ve met total treasures and of course everything in between. Never once have the men I\u2019ve spoken to for more than a message or two told me that my expectations were too high. If he felt that way, it was his job to tell me so. Not leave me sitting at a restaurant wondering what the heck happened. He might have even watched me! Who knows? \n\nI never demanded anything and never have. Thanks for your input, though! All experiences and advice are valuable.",

However, in defense of whomever the heck you\u2019re trashing: just because someone looks heavier doesn\u2019t mean they ARE heavier. Photos are all about angles. You should never base your first impression of someone on a glance at them compared to their photos, unless they are quite obviously not the same person, years older than they claimed to be, or just generally not even close to what you expected. Don\u2019t be so shallow. Nobody said you owed anybody anything, but ghosting someone is gross, especially if you said you\u2019re AT the designated date spot and they show up for that reason. Just tell them you aren\u2019t interested/can\u2019t make it/not to waste *their* time! Lord. Some of y\u2019all really expose yourselves in here.",

I think there is an overemphasis on preparing for the M&G in terms of dress and makeup etc and underemphasis on arriving on time, focused on the meeting and bringing a smile. \n\nYes the dress is appropriate for the location and time of day but I prefer that there is more attention to arriving focused on the meeting than with perfect nails and the perfect outfit. \n\nOn a different but related topic , \"He was to pay for dinner and give me a pre-determined and agreed upon amount as an initial allowance and if it went well, we\u2019d go from there.\"     Asking the SD to pay for the privilege of meeting (beyond a reasonable travel reimbursement) probably helps to discourage many genuine SD as it is  a flashing red light.  \n\nOn the topic of a \"fee\" for attending the M&G.....  what if you, the SB saw some shoes in the window and asked to see them.  What would your reaction to the salesperson be after hearing.... , \"of course, what size,.......  I'll need your credit card as we charge $5/pair to pull them from stock and 10% of the sales price if you want to try them on... but of course we'll credit that against your purchase.\"  \n\nIt's no different if I am interviewing an architect, contractor, property owner, attorney, prospective employee  etc.  I'm not going to pay them to meet with me unless I have asked them to prepare something specific to my project.  \n\nMy personal belief is that those who demand something to show up for a M&G (beyond reimbursement for travel and perhaps a baby sitter)  are self selecting from a lower tier of potential SD.",

There were plans for going to a hotel after the date, but that is never something I guarantee based on bad things that have happened in the past. I didn\u2019t say the amount, so you don\u2019t really have room to judge me based on that. The reason he was supposed to give me a little money was, as I\u2019d mentioned, that I\u2019d been sending him content. Lots and lots of content that, since that incident, I never send without payment now.  He owed me for it and said he preferred cash, which I agreed to, because again, I was young and naive. \n\nOn another note, your beliefs and preferences are yours and I absolutely respect them. However, in my early days I went on a dinner date with a potential SD that gave me a hefty sum just for showing up on time with a smile, and at the end of the date he said we weren\u2019t a good match, but to always remember my time was worth money and not to accept offers of free dates. Obviously, I took his advice with a grain of salt and haven\u2019t applied it to every meeting since, but it goes to show that there are SDs out there that think quite differently than you do. I\u2019ve had three long term arrangements, one of which was entirely online and one mostly so, and dozens of sugar \u201cflings\u201d that were PPM. I had a lot of fun, got a lot of financial help, and gave a LOT of time, affection and other pieces of me to those men because I search for SDs I get along with, truly enjoy talking to and spending time with and am compatible with on a friendship level at the very least. I\u2019ve met assholes, I\u2019ve met total treasures and of course everything in between. Never once have the men I\u2019ve spoken to for more than a message or two told me that my expectations were too high. If he felt that way, it was his job to tell me so. Not leave me sitting at a restaurant wondering what the heck happened. He might have even watched me! Who knows? \n\nI never demanded anything and never have. Thanks for your input, though!

However, in defense of whomever the heck you\u2019re trashing: just because someone looks heavier doesn\u2019t mean they ARE heavier. Photos are all about angles. You should never base your first impression of someone on a glance at them compared to their photos, unless they are quite obviously not the same person, years older than they claimed to be, or just generally not even close to what you expected. Don\u2019t be so shallow. Nobody said you owed anybody anything, but ghosting someone is gross, especially if you said you\u2019re AT the designated date spot and they show up for that reason. Just tell them you aren\u2019t interested/can\u2019t make it/not to waste *their* time! Lord. Some of y\u2019all really expose yourselves in here.",

There were plans for going to a hotel after the date, but that is never something I guarantee based on bad things that have happened in the past. I didn\u2019t say the amount, so you don\u2019t really have room to judge me based on that. The reason he was supposed to give me a little money was, as I\u2019d mentioned, that I\u2019d been sending him content. Lots and lots of content that, since that incident, I never send without payment now.  He owed me for it and said he preferred cash, which I agreed to, because again, I was young and naive. \n\nOn another note, your beliefs and preferences are yours and I absolutely respect them. However, in my early days I went on a dinner date with a potential SD that gave me a hefty sum just for showing up on time with a smile, and at the end of the date he said we weren\u2019t a good match, but to always remember my time was worth money and not to accept offers of free dates. Obviously, I took his advice with a grain of salt and haven\u2019t applied it to every meeting since, but it goes to show that there are SDs out there that think quite differently than you do. I\u2019ve had three long term arrangements, one of which was entirely online and one mostly so, and dozens of sugar \u201cflings\u201d that were PPM. I had a lot of fun, got a lot of financial help, and gave a LOT of time, affection and other pieces of me to those men because I search for SDs I get along with, truly enjoy talking to and spending time with and am compatible with on a friendship level at the very least. I\u2019ve met assholes, I\u2019ve met total treasures and of course everything in between. Never once have the men I\u2019ve spoken to for more than a message or two told me that my expectations were too high. If he felt that way, it was his job to tell me so. Not leave me sitting at a restaurant wondering what the heck happened. He might have even watched me! Who knows? \n\nI never demanded anything and never have. Thanks for your input, though! All experiences and advice are valuable.",

However, in defense of whomever the heck you\u2019re trashing: just because someone looks heavier doesn\u2019t mean they ARE heavier. Photos are all about angles. You should never base your first impression of someone on a glance at them compared to their photos, unless they are quite obviously not the same person, years older than they claimed to be, or just generally not even close to what you expected. Don\u2019t be so shallow. Nobody said you owed anybody anything, but ghosting someone is gross, especially if you said you\u2019re AT the designated date spot and they show up for that reason.

Don\u2019t be so shallow. Nobody said you owed anybody anything, but ghosting someone is gross, especially if you said you\u2019re AT the designated date spot and they show up for that reason. Just tell them you aren\u2019t interested/can\u2019t make it/not to waste *their* time! Lord. Some of y\u2019all really expose yourselves in here.",
