    "body": "So my father passed away at the end of March which was pretty devastating. I had been seeing an SB that was an absolutely wonderful and beautiful human being. She would help anyone she could and never ask for anything in return. She was very supportive of me and I knew she would be there when I got back.\n\nSo I texted her while I was away - and then when I got back all I got was silence. Nothing. She never logged into SA or anything so I figured she might have gotten back with her ex. I gave her space, but I kept wondering. And honestly I wanted closure because I had very genuine, intense feelings for that woman.\n\nSo I start hunting for her online - only to find that she passed away. The news just hit me like a bus and I'm still kinda numb.\n\nWhat I wouldn't give to just see her smile, listen to her laugh and giggle just one more time. And hold her in my arms just once. \n\nSo - if you have an SR based on any amount of feelings - hug them, squeeze them so tight and kiss them, tell them you care for them - because you or they might be gone in an instant.\n\nAnd I can honestly guarantee, now from real experience, that someone will suddenly get a hole in their heart they have no idea how to fill. You can't talk to their family, you cannot reach out to anyone they knew because what you shared was very private, and very secret, and very loving in spite of the rest of the world around us. \n\nSo for fucks sake hug them. Now. \n\nEDIT: It's funny - that even though SR's are usually very private and very secret - that in today's day and age we have a support group like this - of just so many people on on Reddit and the \"side chats\" to share with - that I don't have to feel alone in my grief. Thank you all. I appreciate you.\n\nEDIT #2:\nThank you so very much for all the kind words and condolences. They mean a lot to me. She was one of those very rare people that when they come into your life that you are changed for the better forever having known them. \n\nLate last night I found a small crystalline rose cluster she made by hand and gave me as a gift the last time we were together. She was quite a talented artist. She always teased me for being a guy and liking sparkly and shiny things, even as she admired my dragon figurine collection of various pewter and handmade dragons; some of which have laser cuts and glint under the lights. \n\nSo I just now put that crystal rose under the claw of one of the most detailed dragons I have - her favorite one, and there it will forever stay. In a way I feel like it's symbolic of a dragon forever guarding her memory and her soul.",

She was truly one of those people who cause those whose lives they touch to redefine their scale of what makes a beautiful, awesome person. \n\nI don't think I could ever _not_ measure and compare other people in my life to her memory. She pushed the bar way higher than I ever thought possible. \n\nIt's funny - she was _the one_ that made me only consider anyone older than 25+ because she was totally in tune with the world and had her shit _together_ more than anyone else I ever met at her age - and almost any other!",

            "body": "I normally keep this to my self and have not shared my truth with anyone, maybe it may help your intended goal, with this post.\n\nSome years ago, I had to abruptly get back stateside, as three of my very dearly loved people \\(family but I don't want to get to deep into this\\) were involved in a terrible incident. The hospital staff told me that all three are terminal and that I should execute a DNR. Knowing the intense love for life and fear of loosing their lives, I refused and demanded a full code status. They pulled through the worst phase but it left all of them with multiple chronic organ impairments, they will have many complications and will eventually expire from all of the injuries.\n\nI also have an additional background in medicine and actually dropped out of med school, \\(many years ago for several reasons\\). With this, I decided to put my life on hold and set my company so that it can function without me. I asked all three what their wishes are and all wanted to LIVE so, I committed myself to delivering the best support and care possible. I converted my house into a mini hospital with all kinds of medical equipment, supplies and environment. Hired staff that  later fired, due to the fact that their idea of quality of life was not in line with each of my family's desire was. I buried myself back into studying and researching medicine, blessed as it comes easy to me, and did everything I could to prolong their lives and make it as enjoyable as possible. completely sacrificed my social life and separated myself from any distractions, while fighting with hospitalist that would perform in such a way that it endangered their extension of their lives even more.\n\nLong and short: the first had a less than 10&#37; chance of survival \\- I kept her alive for an additional 2 years and even though she was on a medical ventilator, I still managed to make her smile, multiple times, each and every day. Can't begin to describe how much I miss her.\n\nSecond; kept him alive for 4 years, fantastic practical joker and shared many laughs, even though I had to attend to regular medical emergencies with him, I discovered his response and reactions to meds so well, I knew what it would take to get him back into the safe zone. A few months ago, during my sleep I heard a loud crash and rushed to discover what it was. I found him contorted partially in the floor and up against some furniture. Quick assessment told me that he was in full arrest; I performed mouth to mouth and CPR for about 7 minutes before the EMT's arrived, they tried for and additionally 35 minutes \\(which is a very long time for EMT's\\), finally realized that it was time to call it. I still see the look on his face as he pulled another one of his practical jokes on me.\n\nThird; I have managed to barely keep her alive but even today had to deal with some very bad arrhythmias and sinus tach. finally got her back to a more normal rate and rhythm but now know enough about medicine that I try to blind myself from the truth that I will only have, hopefully, a few more months with my baby...\n\nAs the OP offered and in my own words: Those things you do today; will dictate the joys or regrets that you WILL experience tomorrow. HUG those who mean something to you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

She went \"out of the bowl\" back then as she went vanilla (and I wished her nothing but happiness), but I decided to tke the risk to text her and and ask about my SB and the circumstances around what happened. \n\nShe suddenly realized I was \"that guy\" my SB always talked about being with and was like \"OMG! It was YOU!?!\" and she dropped everything to meet with me. We talked and cried for hours because she hasn't been able to really grieve much either, as my SB's family pretty much ostracized all of her friends after she passed away.\n\nIt felt so good to share with someone in person what she was like in life and I feel so much better having been able to share everything with her best friend, and to everyone here as well.\n\nAll in all it was an okay Friday, all things considered.",

When my fathers  final phase came, no way was I putting him in a hospital. Hospice provided me on the job training to be his care giver.\n\nThat experience showed me to never wait until the end comes, say what you need to say or want to say. Don't let things hangs, don't let things be assumed.\n\nUnfortunately,  we don't always do that. I've referenced that my first real gf story was sad, on here, but never more. \n\nFirst day of school  (6th grade)and I see this angel. We dated for the school year, but there was always something that seemed off (great intuition, though lack of experience in life). \n\nFast forward 3rd years, first day of HS, and I see her in one of my classes. Drugged out in her appearance. She actually graduated 3 years later.\n\nFast forward 6 years. Earlier in therror year I had moved up 'real' sports cars. One night I pulled into a conveniencertain store to get a bottle of water, there were two women at the corner of the store (by the phone). You've probably already figured why they were there.  As I turned to get into my car, they were in my field of view and I realized that it was her. I froze. \n\nI didn't know what to say. I wanted to go over to her and shake some into her, but didn't.  It felt like stepping into a ring with a boxer you know is going to win, but not wanting to get up after his first punch because you didn't think it would hurt that much. I just left. \n\nFast forward to the early part of this decade. I reconnected with my childhood best friend who was her (since birth) friend. And I asked about her.\n\nSomething happened, she became despondent, greatly increased her drug usage and after a few months, gave herself a lethal overdose.\n\nSometimes we don't say things, but you shouldn't beat yourself over it. There's also no better time to start than the present. \n",

Yeah, people ghost in these relationships all the time, especially when what you share is very secret and isn't known to each others circle of friends. So when something happens - an old flame comes back, a new one is found, anything, inevitably the person may disappear. \n\nI just wanted to seek her out and just make sure she was happy, if not with me I just wanted her to be happy.\n\nI have a rather complex belief in the afterlife I've never shared here - so all I can hope for is that in whatever consciousness she might be in that she is happy as measured by the universe she is within.

After reading this, I will be giving her the best hug and kiss goodbye she will accept.\n\nGood advice I would hope everyone listens to and takes heed. \n\nHere I was missing her, thinking she just ghosted me and now i feel so ashamed and guilty for that. Yeah, people ghost in these relationships all the time, especially when what you share is very secret and isn't known to each others circle of friends. So when something happens - an old flame comes back, a new one is found, anything, inevitably the person may disappear. \n\nI just wanted to seek her out and just make sure she was happy, if not with me I just wanted her to be happy.\n\nI have a rather complex belief in the afterlife I've never shared here - so all I can hope for is that in whatever consciousness she might be in that she is happy as measured by the universe she is within. She deserves it.",
