    "body": "I *constantly* see men on this forum preaching that \"money starts when sex starts\" - but in 2 recent threads, especially the \"is non-sex intimacy part of an SR\" one, I've seen dozens of y'all say that an SR is totally definitely not all about sex and if you just wanted to pay for sex you'd hire an escort and you want all the other aspects of a relationship etc.\n\nSo why are SDs so violently chained to the idea that a woman has to have sex with them in order for her to receive an arrangement/allowance/any form of money? Either the non-sex aspects of a relationship are part of an SR and therefore worth compensation, or they aren't\n\nLately I've been noticing more and more men who want to play by escort rules for a sugar relationship - \"I'll pay you only for sex, but you'll treat me like a whole ass serious girlfriend... and if you expect ANY money before you fuck me, you're a rinser\" \n\nWhat?! \n\nHas the bowl undergone some sort of drastic dynamic change in my few months out of it? Are there more Johns/fake SDs now that the lifestyle is becoming more mainstream? Is this forum in particular just getting worse? \n\nBut no, really... *what?!*",

            "body": "Maybe I\u2019m just naive, but every man I\u2019ve met has learned to only start allowance once sex starts *because* of the amount of women he\u2019s met that has strung him along.  I would go as far as to say that a man who actually views an SR as so tit for tat isn\u2019t really an SD and his vote shouldn\u2019t count. (Maybe we\u2019ll give him a quarter vote.)\n\nHowever, what you\u2019re hearing is the collective  of relationships that aren\u2019t really relationships. Men demanding sex and women demanding money. That baseline shouldn\u2019t be what we use as a compass for an SR. And there\u2019s many of them on both sides. \n\nA majority of men that I\u2019ve met, that stated no money til sex, fairly quickly change their tune when they realize I\u2019m a real, live, woman - one who wants the best for their partner and herself. \n\nWho cares about whether the money starts when intimacy starts? It\u2019s okay for all parties to attempt to protect themselves in the beginning. Most girls want the money in hand before clothes come off. And that\u2019s okay too. It\u2019s the same concept.\n\nIt\u2019s in an established SR that we should be making judgements on whether a tit-for-tat relationship is a good one. If you all have been banging for months but he doesn\u2019t hold up his end of the bargain because one night you didn\u2019t have sex - then I\u2019d go out in a limb to say you aren\u2019t dating an SD. \n\nBut in the beginning, to want some protection? That\u2019s just common sense, not the makings of a John.",

Personally, it has never felt very good to me, so I\u2019ve never begun an arrangement that way.  Then there are other arrangements on the opposite end of the spectrum, and I don\u2019t agree with that either, I feel most comfortable somewhere in the middle.  \n\nAnd frankly, even though I enjoy this forum, much of what is written here in this sub does not really reflect my own 10+ years of experience with arrangements. \n\nWhat has always worked for me personally is ONE M&G at which we discuss and set a  monthly gift amount SOLELY for my time, no matter what we decide to do with that time... not just when we are intimate.  No matter what we do, if I am spending time with a SD, it gets covered by that monthly amount. I\u2019m firm on this, and have turned down many men who want to do PPM, even though I know there are many women who begin an arrangement this way. PPM is a relatively new thing, though; it never existed just a few years ago, and although I can definitely see the benefits in some ways, I can totally see the drawbacks. \nIn my very last arrangement, we were together for 3.5 years and there was NO intimacy for the first month\u2026 I simply visited him at his home once each week, we spent some time talking and getting to know each other, and then perhaps we would go to dinner. And the thing is, this was his preference; I fully expected to be intimate the first time I went to his house, but that\u2019s not how he wanted to do things because he really wanted to be comfortable with me first.\n\nSo the best thing for me, in order not to convolute why I am being given money, is to receive a predetermined monthly amount BEFORE any intimacy takes place or any more time is spent with the SD after the initial M&G.",

I definitely regularly feel those things with men, though, which makes me far far more hesitant to have sex with, or even be alone with, men too quickly. \n\nI'd also add that the \"no money before sex\" crew have scoffed, mocked, and insulted the \"M&G gift\" concept, so I wouldn't place you in that group since you've already demonstrated to your POT/SB that it isn't solely about sex in that manner",

There are good people in the \"bowl\", but many who just want something and are unwilling to give anything. The sense of entitlement is everywhere.  Men who expect and women who expect, without any intent to give anything. It's kind of gross.\n\nI always bring money to an initial M&G, even though it's discouraged. I do it because I want to convey my appreciation,  even if we don't move forward. What I will never do again is pay when we're not meeting in the real world.  I hope for eventual physical intimacy,  but don't want it if there's no hope for emotional intimacy.  \n\nWhat really pissses me off is that there are real, and disgusting,  rinsers on SA. You talk many times with a woman, who expresses her attraction,  affection,  and excitement... have a brief M$G ( yes .. dollar sign instead of ampersand  ), where they give you their sob (S.O.B) story, and empty your wallet, and then disappear... leaving nothing but their odor behind. That's what a rinser is, and about 50% of my SA meets have been rinsers. \n\nSo, there are selfish A-holes on both sides. Seems all we can do about it is be on guard and aware that leeches ( either sucking up your money or your body and giving nothing in return  ) are out in numbers on SA, and remember how being used makes you feel, and promise to not do that to someone else.\n\nThere are good people in this, but the \"bowl\" is being used as a toilet by a lot of people.  You won't change them. You just make peace with that, because you know an amazing arrangement is out there, and it comes with the territory. If you're not one of the turds in the bowl, don't become one... just learn how to better sniff them out and avoid them.",

There is an implied understanding in this type of relationship that you will take care of each other\u2019s needs. As long as everyone is honest up front about the goals and intentions it should be fine. If a cute woman tells me she wants to take it slow or she wants to see how it goes and if we really click before being intimate and I like hanging out with her I have no problem hanging out and helping some financially. But as it continues and the financial commitment grows it needs to be moving to an intimate relationship or at some point I may need to look elsewhere.",

From experience, it truly changes everything. Give a small gift (a perfume or similar) or an envelope at lunch out of nowhere (doesn\u2019t have to contain a lot) and you automatically gain that girl\u2019s appreciation. \n\nYou risk spending a few $ on someone who might not end up sleeping with you, and you increase your chances of finding someone who will actually like you as a person. If you don\u2019t mind a girl pretending you don\u2019t have to worry about it. If you\u2019re looking for something short term, again no need to worry about it.

Your belief that tenet 1 should be paid for, even without intimacy ignores how a properly functioning arrangement is supposed to work. \n\nAny SD worth having is prepared to invest time, and likely money (e.g. costs for dinners) for platonic M&G\u2019s, to assess compatibility, before any intimacy happens.  I might be misunderstanding your post,  but I think you are saying that SB\u2019s should be getting paid for platonic arrangements, and that SD\u2019s who disagree are no better than Johns. Lot\u2019s of us started out that way, got rinsed, and modified our behavior to not let it happen again.  \n\nThe non-sex aspects of an arrangement ARE worth paying for, which is one of your points.   But not if that is all there is.  I compensate my SB way beyond anything any escort would get from me for just sex.  Because we have a great personal connection and there is intimacy.

It\u2019s to find out if you like each other.\n* No one has to do anything they don\u2019t want to do. But if what you\u2019re looking for and what s/he is looking for don\u2019t match, best to move on.\n* An SD can help out an SB if she needs help or he just wants to be generous. But it\u2019s not mandatory.\n* Both sides have to be careful. There are cheaters and scammers who target both SDs and SBs. Even if we\u2019re not cheaters or scammers ourselves, we have to watch out for the ones who are.\n* Having said that, it\u2019s especially important to make sure the SB feels safe. Losing money is one thing. Getting hurt is something else.\n\nDisagreements:\n\n* In a new relationship (not long-term) SBs generally believe payment in advance. Many SDs worry about getting ripped off, and won\u2019t pay until after.\n* Some SBs think that \u201creal\u201d SDs pay allowances, pay up front, pay even if there\u2019s no intimacy, and will help an SB out financially if asks him to. Some SDs disagree with all the above, and think a \u201creal\u201d SB is not in it just for the money.\n* Some SBs think that a man is only a \u201dreal\u201d SD if he pays a certain amount, or has a certain income, or does other specific things.\n* Some SDs think many SB\u2019s are not attractive enough to be in the bowl, and are only fooling themselves if they think they\u2019re going to find an SR. Some SBs believe that attitude is offensive, and that there\u2019s someone for everyone.\n* Some SDs think it\u2019s not a \u201creal\u201d SR unless it includes affection, or kissing, or genuine feelings. Some SBs think those kinds of things should cost extra.",

A lot of \u201ccommon practices\u201d that don\u2019t mean diddly squat because SLF/SDF aren\u2019t representative of the actual bowl. It\u2019s a great resource for naive idiots not to get scammed but beyond that they\u2019re not some guideline I\u2019m using for my SR. \n\nEvery time I see a girl/woman write, \u201cOh, I\u2019m not looking for you to pay everything because I know some girls do\u201d, or \u201cI only want experiences yadda yadda\u201d, I laugh. You shouldn\u2019t be forced to continue shortchanging yourself. \n\nThe cognitive dissonance is very real.\n\nEdit: I mean people here pushed someone to turn \u201cpro\u201d because she wasn\u2019t \u201csugar dating\u201d even though she was clearly struggling.

If so, we just have different outlooks on what relationships should be. And that\u2019s fine - I\u2019ve had a lot of conversations with women I respect who believe men ought to provide for women as a baseline assumption of how heterosexual relationships work. I disagree with the premise obviously, because I believe in individual responsibility and financial independence. But under that premise, that men should provide,  I understand why that would translate to SRs and allow a SB to feel ok demanding money from someone she claims to love. It\u2019s just a different world view.",

You have made a choice to take a job that\u2019s low paying because you love it. That\u2019s an entirely valid choice and I support you making it. With that choice comes the fact that you\u2019re going to be struggling for money, which you obviously knew when you made the choice to take and keep the job. \n\nBut where we diverge (I think - I might be wrong) is that you expect/want your SBF or maybe potential future vanilla partner to take the responsibility for your choices. Because you chose a low paying job, he should pay your bills. And if you had a better paying job or a less wealthy partner, you wouldn\u2019t expect the same thing. Or maybe you wouldn\u2019t even date someone who couldn\u2019t/wouldn\u2019t provide for you financially. So the fact that you\u2019re in need and he can help means he should, even though it\u2019s your choice to be in need.  I disagree with that. \n\nI could never accept, never mind ask for, money from someone I had a real relationship with. Because their place in my life is the benefit to me, I don\u2019t need more, and taking more would be unfair and imbalanced. In an arrangement balance is only achieved once I get my allowance because I don\u2019t get the benefit just from their company. It\u2019s honestly just a matter of principal for me - I can\u2019t take more from a partner than I offer in return without feeling bad. \n\nBut, I know plenty of women are of the mentality that more is more and would never turn down support that\u2019s offered. And while I don\u2019t agree with it, I can recognize that it\u2019s not a uncommon mentality, especially in the bowl.  And those women are certainly maximizing the benefits they can get from relationships, so there\u2019s definitely some props deserved. I just can\u2019t do it.",

Not in my opinion anyway. I\u2019m more concerned about finding a SD that shares a mutual expectation that we will have outdoor time as well as indoor, that the arrangement is going to continue past one date or ten, and that I find a good personality match and not just screen out Johns based on the criminal history and recommendations. \n\nThat being said, it\u2019s hardly surprising or important that we diverge on what we look for in the bowl. In my opinion people that want relationships instead of arrangements should get off seeking arrangements and maybe try a site dedicated to relationships- like match or eharmony.

It was part of a monthly arrangement and while most of the time we did.   Sometimes we didn\u2019t.   \n\nThe point here is when does an arrangement start.   To me it starts when we go past the platonic meeting and greeting.   That may take a few meets - which is fine.   But if you accept the arrangement starts at some point - to me that point is when we get intimate.   \n\nNow of course we could separate the timing.   We could agree to pay at the end of the month.   But that\u2019s doesn\u2019t work for the sb when the sd is unreliable.   And you don\u2019t know that for a while.  \n\nOf course you could pay up front but as many others have described, experience says that until trust is developed that is too risky for the sd.   \n\nSo the world has developed the ppm to get us into the arrangement with balanced risk.   And that\u2019s what we are talking about.    Balanced risk.   Until we go intimate it\u2019s not an arrangement (unless you agree to a platonic one) and neither party wants to risk scamming so we have ppm on the first intimate date.  \n\nYour message implies that this is an issue.   I don\u2019t think so - I think it is evolution of the sd/sb arrangement.   \n\nOf course you could come at it - as you have - as a single transaction - and sure some people will look at it this way, but from a real arrangement perspective it is just logical evolution.",

There is no contradiction or cognitive dissonance going on -- just a misunderstanding of what many SDs are saying (possibly because SDs are saying it badly -- misunderstandings can happen at either end of a discussion).\n\nI start financial support when we're in an adult relationship, just as I suggest SBs not have sex until financial support happens.  Once that happens, and trust is earned, everything gets much looser.\n\nPart of what's important here is to recognize that the bowl reality is: there are MANY bad people in the bowl, who are looking to manipulate and/or scam SBs or SDs.  As an SD, you shouldn't say \"hey SB, ignore that -- just trust me\".  This post was exactly the opposite case, \"hey SDs, there's a zillion rinser and scam stories out there, but you should ignore all those, to my benefit\".  Both SDs and SBs should recognize that the beginning of the arrangement will be a little more structured, so both stay safe; the more unstructured arrangement is something that's built as trust is earned.\n\nIn my less charitable moments, I sometimes think: SBs are pretending to not understand the difference between an ongoing arrangement where trust is built, and the best practices required at the beginning of an arrangement because of so many bad actors, in order to put all the risk elsewhere.   If SBs want SDs to drop \"no money before honey\" as a start-of-arrangement guideline, they should drop \"no honey before money\".  Fact is, both are best practices at the beginning, both are irrelevant once the arrangement gets going.",

Pretending to not understand that in order to argue that one of those guidelines should be dropped -- but not the other -- is at best disingenuous",

A date is a date.\n\nI also think this is the SB equivalent of an SD saying, \"Oh ho! So you want an allowance?  I didn't realize you're *all about the money*\" .  We all recognize that for the disingenuous manipulation it is.  Just because an SB wants an allowance, that doesn't mean she's \"only about the money\".   Arrangements are built on a foundation of intimacy and allowance.  That doesn't mean that's all that matters, as has been shown over and over again in slf -- we all very much care about other factors such as emotional intimacy, attraction, etc., to some extent or other.  But an SD who is too emotionally immature to understand that an arrangement is multifaceted but allowance is always part of it, is missing the point -- an SB can both be about wanting an amazing multifaceted arrangement, and saying allowance should be part of it, there's no contradiction.  I assume no reason to have to highlight the equivalent discussion around SBs.",

I\u2019ve been in both these types of arrangements and they\u2019re not as uncommon as people here make it seem. \n\nI think that the most effective way to get a SB who actually likes you and will appreciate you is to not treat her like an escort, and show you\u2019re not just valuing her based on whether she has sex with you or not. From experience, it truly changes everything. Give a small gift (a perfume or similar) or an envelope at lunch out of nowhere (doesn\u2019t have to contain a lot) and you automatically gain that girl\u2019s appreciation. \n\nYou risk spending a few $ on someone who might not end up sleeping with you, and you increase your chances of finding someone who will actually like you as a person. If you don\u2019t mind a girl pretending you don\u2019t have to worry about it. If you\u2019re looking for something short term, again no need to worry about it.

They love her BECAUSE she\u2019s in SB mode. I mean the reason any SD claims to seek out SBs is because they don\u2019t want the drama and complications of vanilla dating. So I\u2019d be willing to bet the love would not be there if she was acting like a vanilla girlfriend, started not being in the mood, nagging about whatever, wanting marriage and kids, etc etc. Because the SB would turn into the wife essentially.",

If so, we just have different outlooks on what relationships should be. And that\u2019s fine - I\u2019ve had a lot of conversations with women I respect who believe men ought to provide for women as a baseline assumption of how heterosexual relationships work. I disagree with the premise obviously, because I believe in individual responsibility and financial independence.

You have made a choice to take a job that\u2019s low paying because you love it. That\u2019s an entirely valid choice and I support you making it. With that choice comes the fact that you\u2019re going to be struggling for money, which you obviously knew when you made the choice to take and keep the job. \n\nBut where we diverge (I think - I might be wrong) is that you expect/want your SBF or maybe potential future vanilla partner to take the responsibility for your choices. Because you chose a low paying job, he should pay your bills. And if you had a better paying job or a less wealthy partner, you wouldn\u2019t expect the same thing. Or maybe you wouldn\u2019t even date someone who couldn\u2019t/wouldn\u2019t provide for you financially. So the fact that you\u2019re in need and he can help means he should, even though it\u2019s your choice to be in need.  I disagree with that. \n\nI could never accept, never mind ask for, money from someone I had a real relationship with. Because their place in my life is the benefit to me, I don\u2019t need more, and taking more would be unfair and imbalanced. In an arrangement balance is only achieved once I get my allowance because I don\u2019t get the benefit just from their company. It\u2019s honestly just a matter of principal for me - I can\u2019t take more from a partner than I offer in return without feeling bad. \n\nBut, I know plenty of women are of the mentality that more is more and would never turn down support that\u2019s offered. And while I don\u2019t agree with it, I can recognize that it\u2019s not a uncommon mentality, especially in the bowl.  And those women are certainly maximizing the benefits they can get from relationships, so there\u2019s definitely some props deserved. I just can\u2019t do it.",

It just felt wrong to me and it conflicted with who I am as a person and my values. I think that\u2019s the essence of the disagreement. \n\nBut I do think we\u2019re far apart in belief, and I appreciate that we\u2019ve stayed civil anyway. It\u2019s good for the community to represent different views so we don\u2019t become an echo chamber.

Not in my opinion anyway. I\u2019m more concerned about finding a SD that shares a mutual expectation that we will have outdoor time as well as indoor, that the arrangement is going to continue past one date or ten, and that I find a good personality match and not just screen out Johns based on the criminal history and recommendations. \n\nThat being said, it\u2019s hardly surprising or important that we diverge on what we look for in the bowl. In my opinion people that want relationships instead of arrangements should get off seeking arrangements and maybe try a site dedicated to relationships- like match or eharmony. But since I can\u2019t effectively gatekeep the whole bowl to my standards, and neither can you, all that matters is we can coexist civilly.",

There is no contradiction or cognitive dissonance going on -- just a misunderstanding of what many SDs are saying (possibly because SDs are saying it badly -- misunderstandings can happen at either end of a discussion).\n\nI start financial support when we're in an adult relationship, just as I suggest SBs not have sex until financial support happens.  Once that happens, and trust is earned, everything gets much looser.\n\nPart of what's important here is to recognize that the bowl reality is: there are MANY bad people in the bowl, who are looking to manipulate and/or scam SBs or SDs.  As an SD, you shouldn't say \"hey SB, ignore that -- just trust me\".  This post was exactly the opposite case, \"hey SDs, there's a zillion rinser and scam stories out there, but you should ignore all those, to my benefit\".  Both SDs and SBs should recognize that the beginning of the arrangement will be a little more structured, so both stay safe; the more unstructured arrangement is something that's built as trust is earned.\n\nIn my less charitable moments, I sometimes think: SBs are pretending to not understand the difference between an ongoing arrangement where trust is built, and the best practices required at the beginning of an arrangement because of so many bad actors, in order to put all the risk elsewhere.   If SBs want SDs to drop \"no money before honey\" as a start-of-arrangement guideline, they should drop \"no honey before money\".  Fact is, both are best practices at the beginning, both are irrelevant once the arrangement gets going.",

A date is a date.\n\nI also think this is the SB equivalent of an SD saying, \"Oh ho! So you want an allowance?  I didn't realize you're *all about the money*\" .  We all recognize that for the disingenuous manipulation it is.  Just because an SB wants an allowance, that doesn't mean she's \"only about the money\".   Arrangements are built on a foundation of intimacy and allowance.  That doesn't mean that's all that matters, as has been shown over and over again in slf -- we all very much care about other factors such as emotional intimacy, attraction, etc., to some extent or other.  But an SD who is too emotionally immature to understand that an arrangement is multifaceted but allowance is always part of it, is missing the point -- an SB can both be about wanting an amazing multifaceted arrangement, and saying allowance should be part of it, there's no contradiction.  I assume no reason to have to highlight the equivalent discussion around SBs.",

Neither I nor any of my RL or online SB friends would ever pursue an arrangement with a man who immediately wanted sex. \n\nMy first long term SR, we went on half a dozen dates over a month and a half before we even got a hotel room together - because just like a vanilla relationship, it's supposed to *develop*. We spent time and got to know each other as opposed to just being focused on getting into bed, and it cultivated one of the best SR either of us ever had. Of course not everyone takes the same amount of time, but moving to the bedroom after one or two dates is crazy hasty to me. As I say on SA, \"Chemistry is key,\" and feeling forced into sleeping with someone I have no chemistry with just feels like escorting, not an SR.",

If so, we just have different outlooks on what relationships should be. And that\u2019s fine - I\u2019ve had a lot of conversations with women I respect who believe men ought to provide for women as a baseline assumption of how heterosexual relationships work. I disagree with the premise obviously, because I believe in individual responsibility and financial independence. But under that premise, that men should provide,  I understand why that would translate to SRs and allow a SB to feel ok demanding money from someone she claims to love. It\u2019s just a different world view.",

My SBF tells me almost every day i can quit and go to school full time. Because he wants to support not just financially but all of me. He also understands that these kids mean the world to me so he happily pays my bills and lets me keep my money for what i want it for. That to me is the epitome of someone who loves me. Hes also funny and cute and charming and intelligent. \n\nThe line of reasoning about not letting me be broke came from him. I didnt make that up. \n\nSo i guess by your line of reasoning i should give up the job i love and do something where i make more money so im more independent?  Even though i know he loves me and wants the best for me? Im just confused about the issue i guess.",

You have made a choice to take a job that\u2019s low paying because you love it. That\u2019s an entirely valid choice and I support you making it. With that choice comes the fact that you\u2019re going to be struggling for money, which you obviously knew when you made the choice to take and keep the job. \n\nBut where we diverge (I think - I might be wrong) is that you expect/want your SBF or maybe potential future vanilla partner to take the responsibility for your choices. Because you chose a low paying job, he should pay your bills. And if you had a better paying job or a less wealthy partner, you wouldn\u2019t expect the same thing. Or maybe you wouldn\u2019t even date someone who couldn\u2019t/wouldn\u2019t provide for you financially. So the fact that you\u2019re in need and he can help means he should, even though it\u2019s your choice to be in need.  I disagree with that. \n\nI could never accept, never mind ask for, money from someone I had a real relationship with. Because their place in my life is the benefit to me, I don\u2019t need more, and taking more would be unfair and imbalanced. In an arrangement balance is only achieved once I get my allowance because I don\u2019t get the benefit just from their company. It\u2019s honestly just a matter of principal for me - I can\u2019t take more from a partner than I offer in return without feeling bad. \n\nBut, I know plenty of women are of the mentality that more is more and would never turn down support that\u2019s offered. And while I don\u2019t agree with it, I can recognize that it\u2019s not a uncommon mentality, especially in the bowl.  And those women are certainly maximizing the benefits they can get from relationships, so there\u2019s definitely some props deserved. I just can\u2019t do it.",

In fact, that's the whole reason we're looking for an arrangement, instead of paying an escort.\n\nIMO, professionals should stay off Seeking Arrangement. Not sure why they're there anyway. There are plenty of other places for escorts to find clients. I mean Backpage is gone, but there are other places.",

I\u2019m more concerned about finding a SD that shares a mutual expectation that we will have outdoor time as well as indoor, that the arrangement is going to continue past one date or ten, and that I find a good personality match and not just screen out Johns based on the criminal history and recommendations. \n\nThat being said, it\u2019s hardly surprising or important that we diverge on what we look for in the bowl. In my opinion people that want relationships instead of arrangements should get off seeking arrangements and maybe try a site dedicated to relationships- like match or eharmony.

Just because an SB wants an allowance, that doesn't mean she's \"only about the money\".   Arrangements are built on a foundation of intimacy and allowance.  That doesn't mean that's all that matters, as has been shown over and over again in slf -- we all very much care about other factors such as emotional intimacy, attraction, etc., to some extent or other.  But an SD who is too emotionally immature to understand that an arrangement is multifaceted but allowance is always part of it, is missing the point -- an SB can both be about wanting an amazing multifaceted arrangement, and saying allowance should be part of it, there's no contradiction.  I assume no reason to have to highlight the equivalent discussion around SBs.",

We spent time and got to know each other as opposed to just being focused on getting into bed, and it cultivated one of the best SR either of us ever had. Of course not everyone takes the same amount of time, but moving to the bedroom after one or two dates is crazy hasty to me.

My parents could support me a bit, they certainly love me, but they don\u2019t give me money, and that certainly doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t love me.  \n\nI mean, would you expect a vanilla guy who makes more than you but isn\u2019t SD level wealthy to pay some portion of your bills for you? If so, we just have different outlooks on what relationships should be. And that\u2019s fine - I\u2019ve had a lot of conversations with women I respect who believe men ought to provide for women as a baseline assumption of how heterosexual relationships work. I disagree with the premise obviously, because I believe in individual responsibility and financial independence. But under that premise, that men should provide,  I understand why that would translate to SRs and allow a SB to feel ok demanding money from someone she claims to love. It\u2019s just a different world view.",

My SBF tells me almost every day i can quit and go to school full time. Because he wants to support not just financially but all of me. He also understands that these kids mean the world to me so he happily pays my bills and lets me keep my money for what i want it for. That to me is the epitome of someone who loves me. Hes also funny and cute and charming and intelligent. \n\nThe line of reasoning about not letting me be broke came from him. I didnt make that up. \n\nSo i guess by your line of reasoning i should give up the job i love and do something where i make more money so im more independent?  Even though i know he loves me and wants the best for me? Im just confused about the issue i guess.",

You have made a choice to take a job that\u2019s low paying because you love it. That\u2019s an entirely valid choice and I support you making it. With that choice comes the fact that you\u2019re going to be struggling for money, which you obviously knew when you made the choice to take and keep the job. \n\nBut where we diverge (I think - I might be wrong) is that you expect/want your SBF or maybe potential future vanilla partner to take the responsibility for your choices. Because you chose a low paying job, he should pay your bills. And if you had a better paying job or a less wealthy partner, you wouldn\u2019t expect the same thing. Or maybe you wouldn\u2019t even date someone who couldn\u2019t/wouldn\u2019t provide for you financially. So the fact that you\u2019re in need and he can help means he should, even though it\u2019s your choice to be in need.  I disagree with that. \n\nI could never accept, never mind ask for, money from someone I had a real relationship with. Because their place in my life is the benefit to me, I don\u2019t need more, and taking more would be unfair and imbalanced. In an arrangement balance is only achieved once I get my allowance because I don\u2019t get the benefit just from their company. It\u2019s honestly just a matter of principal for me - I can\u2019t take more from a partner than I offer in return without feeling bad. \n\nBut, I know plenty of women are of the mentality that more is more and would never turn down support that\u2019s offered. And while I don\u2019t agree with it, I can recognize that it\u2019s not a uncommon mentality, especially in the bowl.  And those women are certainly maximizing the benefits they can get from relationships, so there\u2019s definitely some props deserved. I just can\u2019t do it.",

So you want an allowance?  I didn't realize you're *all about the money*\" .  We all recognize that for the disingenuous manipulation it is.  Just because an SB wants an allowance, that doesn't mean she's \"only about the money\".   Arrangements are built on a foundation of intimacy and allowance.  That doesn't mean that's all that matters, as has been shown over and over again in slf -- we all very much care about other factors such as emotional intimacy, attraction, etc., to some extent or other.  But an SD who is too emotionally immature to understand that an arrangement is multifaceted but allowance is always part of it, is missing the point -- an SB can both be about wanting an amazing multifaceted arrangement, and saying allowance should be part of it, there's no contradiction.  I assume no reason to have to highlight the equivalent discussion around SBs.",

If so, we just have different outlooks on what relationships should be. And that\u2019s fine - I\u2019ve had a lot of conversations with women I respect who believe men ought to provide for women as a baseline assumption of how heterosexual relationships work. I disagree with the premise obviously, because I believe in individual responsibility and financial independence. But under that premise, that men should provide,  I understand why that would translate to SRs and allow a SB to feel ok demanding money from someone she claims to love. It\u2019s just a different world view.",

You have made a choice to take a job that\u2019s low paying because you love it. That\u2019s an entirely valid choice and I support you making it. With that choice comes the fact that you\u2019re going to be struggling for money, which you obviously knew when you made the choice to take and keep the job. \n\nBut where we diverge (I think - I might be wrong) is that you expect/want your SBF or maybe potential future vanilla partner to take the responsibility for your choices. Because you chose a low paying job, he should pay your bills. And if you had a better paying job or a less wealthy partner, you wouldn\u2019t expect the same thing. Or maybe you wouldn\u2019t even date someone who couldn\u2019t/wouldn\u2019t provide for you financially. So the fact that you\u2019re in need and he can help means he should, even though it\u2019s your choice to be in need.  I disagree with that. \n\nI could never accept, never mind ask for, money from someone I had a real relationship with. Because their place in my life is the benefit to me, I don\u2019t need more, and taking more would be unfair and imbalanced. In an arrangement balance is only achieved once I get my allowance because I don\u2019t get the benefit just from their company. It\u2019s honestly just a matter of principal for me - I can\u2019t take more from a partner than I offer in return without feeling bad. \n\nBut, I know plenty of women are of the mentality that more is more and would never turn down support that\u2019s offered. And while I don\u2019t agree with it, I can recognize that it\u2019s not a uncommon mentality, especially in the bowl.  And those women are certainly maximizing the benefits they can get from relationships, so there\u2019s definitely some props deserved. I just can\u2019t do it.",

He also understands that these kids mean the world to me so he happily pays my bills and lets me keep my money for what i want it for. That to me is the epitome of someone who loves me. Hes also funny and cute and charming and intelligent. \n\nThe line of reasoning about not letting me be broke came from him. I didnt make that up. \n\nSo i guess by your line of reasoning i should give up the job i love and do something where i make more money so im more independent?

You have made a choice to take a job that\u2019s low paying because you love it. That\u2019s an entirely valid choice and I support you making it. With that choice comes the fact that you\u2019re going to be struggling for money, which you obviously knew when you made the choice to take and keep the job. \n\nBut where we diverge (I think - I might be wrong) is that you expect/want your SBF or maybe potential future vanilla partner to take the responsibility for your choices. Because you chose a low paying job, he should pay your bills. And if you had a better paying job or a less wealthy partner, you wouldn\u2019t expect the same thing. Or maybe you wouldn\u2019t even date someone who couldn\u2019t/wouldn\u2019t provide for you financially. So the fact that you\u2019re in need and he can help means he should, even though it\u2019s your choice to be in need.  I disagree with that. \n\nI could never accept, never mind ask for, money from someone I had a real relationship with. Because their place in my life is the benefit to me, I don\u2019t need more, and taking more would be unfair and imbalanced. In an arrangement balance is only achieved once I get my allowance because I don\u2019t get the benefit just from their company. It\u2019s honestly just a matter of principal for me - I can\u2019t take more from a partner than I offer in return without feeling bad. \n\nBut, I know plenty of women are of the mentality that more is more and would never turn down support that\u2019s offered. And while I don\u2019t agree with it, I can recognize that it\u2019s not a uncommon mentality, especially in the bowl.  And those women are certainly maximizing the benefits they can get from relationships, so there\u2019s definitely some props deserved. I just can\u2019t do it.",

In fact, that's the whole reason we're looking for an arrangement, instead of paying an escort.\n\nIMO, professionals should stay off Seeking Arrangement. Not sure why they're there anyway.

In my opinion people that want relationships instead of arrangements should get off seeking arrangements and maybe try a site dedicated to relationships- like match or eharmony.

            "body": "There\u2019s no should/shouldn\u2019t in my belief that everyone is responsible for themselves. You have made a choice to take a job that\u2019s low paying because you love it. That\u2019s an entirely valid choice and I support you making it. With that choice comes the fact that you\u2019re going to be struggling for money, which you obviously knew when you made the choice to take and keep the job. \n\nBut where we diverge (I think - I might be wrong) is that you expect/want your SBF or maybe potential future vanilla partner to take the responsibility for your choices. Because you chose a low paying job, he should pay your bills. And if you had a better paying job or a less wealthy partner, you wouldn\u2019t expect the same thing. Or maybe you wouldn\u2019t even date someone who couldn\u2019t/wouldn\u2019t provide for you financially. So the fact that you\u2019re in need and he can help means he should, even though it\u2019s your choice to be in need.  I disagree with that. \n\nI could never accept, never mind ask for, money from someone I had a real relationship with. Because their place in my life is the benefit to me, I don\u2019t need more, and taking more would be unfair and imbalanced. In an arrangement balance is only achieved once I get my allowance because I don\u2019t get the benefit just from their company. It\u2019s honestly just a matter of principal for me - I can\u2019t take more from a partner than I offer in return without feeling bad. \n\nBut, I know plenty of women are of the mentality that more is more and would never turn down support that\u2019s offered. And while I don\u2019t agree with it, I can recognize that it\u2019s not a uncommon mentality, especially in the bowl.  And those women are certainly maximizing the benefits they can get from relationships, so there\u2019s definitely some props deserved. I just can\u2019t do it.",

I\u2019m with a man who is helping me out, not buying access my body.\n\nThe last people to give me money for nothing were my parents, but ended when I was 18.

Personally, I try to avoid women who don't like men.\n\n>So no, I would not have dated any of the SDs in real life, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I didn\u2019t end up liking some of them...\n\nI understand you wouldn't date me in real life.

In fact, that's the whole reason we're looking for an arrangement, instead of paying an escort.\n\nIMO, professionals should stay off Seeking Arrangement. Not sure why they're there anyway. There are plenty of other places for escorts to find clients. I mean Backpage is gone, but there are other places.",

In my opinion people that want relationships instead of arrangements should get off seeking arrangements and maybe try a site dedicated to relationships- like match or eharmony.

I\u2019m more concerned about finding a SD that shares a mutual expectation that we will have outdoor time as well as indoor, that the arrangement is going to continue past one date or ten, and that I find a good personality match and not just screen out Johns based on the criminal history and recommendations. \n\nThat being said, it\u2019s hardly surprising or important that we diverge on what we look for in the bowl. In my opinion people that want relationships instead of arrangements should get off seeking arrangements and maybe try a site dedicated to relationships- like match or eharmony. But since I can\u2019t effectively gatekeep the whole bowl to my standards, and neither can you, all that matters is we can coexist civilly.",
