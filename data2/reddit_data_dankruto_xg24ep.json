The emphasis on clan techniques and power wouldn\u2019t let their name legacy stay quiet, either. Everyone would be paying a lot of attention to Senju descendants.\n\nI\u2019m more confused how they don\u2019t keep up a community with each other, same name or not. They were still raised as siblings and cousins - family you can still reach out to. Tsunade seemed so isolated with Hashirama and Tobirama as her only family connections other than Nawaki. No other uncles, aunts, or cousins she was raised with, and presumably parents that died early on. This would make more sense if the Senju had already been getting pretty small by the countries founding, and it wasn\u2019t.\n\nI\u2019m fine with Sakura emulating her because I\u2019m sick and tired of the only \u201cgood\u201d ninjas coming from insane legacies.

It also reminds me of how we used to think Sakura could be a poison/illusion specialist before Tsunade seriously entered the narrative. What a time.\n\nThe headcanon makes the best sense out of the nonsensical writing of _why_ the Senju were wiped out during peace times, for sure. The other ninja clans of Naruto deserved better, really.\n\nI remember hoping for more Hyuuga world-building after meeting Neji in the Chuunin Exam and meeting Hinata and Neji again after the timeskip. I thought it would be a great way to really introduce making Hinata and Naruto friends - through learning about her clan and how Neji has found a way to thrive despite its shackles. I was, of course, devastatingly wrong. Kept waiting for other clans beside the Uchiha to get a turn, to no avail.\n\nThe Hyuuga\u2019s seem like even bigger \u201cblood purists\u201d than the Uchiha\u2019s give the air of, so I doubt it. I also doubt the Senju would be too chill about the Main/Side Branch thing, too. I think they became parts of civilian families for the most part, and some minor clans like the Ino-Shika-Chou.

No one wanted to have their family be called Senju like they were? Sons are also often the ones to carry the family name, and their wives and kids carry that name as a result. That\u2019s why I mentioned \u201conly having daughters\u201d in the first place. Because that clearly _wasn\u2019t_ the case.\n\n_That\u2019s_ what doesn\u2019t make sense. They\u2019re not the only clan in Konoha that might have intermingled with others, either - the Ino-Shika-Chou is a group I think would most likely do something similar, but _they_ are still around, and they seemed smaller than the Senju, so why aren\u2019t the Senju? The Senju were just unnecessarily written out of the story and there isn\u2019t a lot of reasonable excuses to make sense of it - or rather, there shouldn\u2019t have to be.\n\nEdit: the last line",

Being a senju fan myself and just a genral curious fan because the uchiha got 803939392929 side plots and explanations and we didn\u2019t/don\u2019t know who minatos parents were or an awesome side plot of minato and how nasty he really was like he single handily won the 3rd great ninja war getting him promoted to hokage they make him seem so innocent yet he probably killed more people than itachi its crazy i would literally pay to see a minato arch of his dark days. Or how hashirama died, an awesome hashirama arch of him fighting the tailed beasts or bringing villages together just quick montage. Literally the uchiha slaughter night got like 100 different perspectives. Who nagatos parents really were and how they made it from the land of fire to the rain village. And they never explained",

The emphasis on clan techniques and power wouldn\u2019t let their name legacy stay quiet, either. Everyone would be paying a lot of attention to Senju descendants.\n\nI\u2019m more confused how they don\u2019t keep up a community with each other, same name or not. They were still raised as siblings and cousins - family you can still reach out to. Tsunade seemed so isolated with Hashirama and Tobirama as her only family connections other than Nawaki. No other uncles, aunts, or cousins she was raised with, and presumably parents that died early on. This would make more sense if the Senju had already been getting pretty small by the countries founding, and it wasn\u2019t.\n\nI\u2019m fine with Sakura emulating her because I\u2019m sick and tired of the only \u201cgood\u201d ninjas coming from insane legacies.

The other ninja clans of Naruto deserved better, really.\n\nI remember hoping for more Hyuuga world-building after meeting Neji in the Chuunin Exam and meeting Hinata and Neji again after the timeskip. I thought it would be a great way to really introduce making Hinata and Naruto friends - through learning about her clan and how Neji has found a way to thrive despite its shackles. I was, of course, devastatingly wrong. Kept waiting for other clans beside the Uchiha to get a turn, to no avail.\n\nThe Hyuuga\u2019s seem like even bigger \u201cblood purists\u201d than the Uchiha\u2019s give the air of, so I doubt it. I also doubt the Senju would be too chill about the Main/Side Branch thing, too. I think they became parts of civilian families for the most part, and some minor clans like the Ino-Shika-Chou.

That\u2019s why I mentioned \u201conly having daughters\u201d in the first place. Because that clearly _wasn\u2019t_ the case.\n\n_That\u2019s_ what doesn\u2019t make sense. They\u2019re not the only clan in Konoha that might have intermingled with others, either - the Ino-Shika-Chou is a group I think would most likely do something similar, but _they_ are still around, and they seemed smaller than the Senju, so why aren\u2019t the Senju? The Senju were just unnecessarily written out of the story and there isn\u2019t a lot of reasonable excuses to make sense of it - or rather, there shouldn\u2019t have to be.\n\nEdit: the last line",

The emphasis on clan techniques and power wouldn\u2019t let their name legacy stay quiet, either. Everyone would be paying a lot of attention to Senju descendants.\n\nI\u2019m more confused how they don\u2019t keep up a community with each other, same name or not. They were still raised as siblings and cousins - family you can still reach out to. Tsunade seemed so isolated with Hashirama and Tobirama as her only family connections other than Nawaki. No other uncles, aunts, or cousins she was raised with, and presumably parents that died early on. This would make more sense if the Senju had already been getting pretty small by the countries founding, and it wasn\u2019t.\n\nI\u2019m fine with Sakura emulating her because I\u2019m sick and tired of the only \u201cgood\u201d ninjas coming from insane legacies. I want to have this, at least. Let the underdog narrative exist in more than just Lee.",

It also reminds me of how we used to think Sakura could be a poison/illusion specialist before Tsunade seriously entered the narrative. What a time.\n\nThe headcanon makes the best sense out of the nonsensical writing of _why_ the Senju were wiped out during peace times, for sure. The other ninja clans of Naruto deserved better, really.\n\nI remember hoping for more Hyuuga world-building after meeting Neji in the Chuunin Exam and meeting Hinata and Neji again after the timeskip. I thought it would be a great way to really introduce making Hinata and Naruto friends - through learning about her clan and how Neji has found a way to thrive despite its shackles. I was, of course, devastatingly wrong. Kept waiting for other clans beside the Uchiha to get a turn, to no avail.\n\nThe Hyuuga\u2019s seem like even bigger \u201cblood purists\u201d than the Uchiha\u2019s give the air of, so I doubt it. I also doubt the Senju would be too chill about the Main/Side Branch thing, too. I think they became parts of civilian families for the most part, and some minor clans like the Ino-Shika-Chou. They seem chill enough to mingle with.",

They were still raised as siblings and cousins - family you can still reach out to. Tsunade seemed so isolated with Hashirama and Tobirama as her only family connections other than Nawaki. No other uncles, aunts, or cousins she was raised with, and presumably parents that died early on. This would make more sense if the Senju had already been getting pretty small by the countries founding, and it wasn\u2019t.\n\nI\u2019m fine with Sakura emulating her because I\u2019m sick and tired of the only \u201cgood\u201d ninjas coming from insane legacies.

It also reminds me of how we used to think Sakura could be a poison/illusion specialist before Tsunade seriously entered the narrative.

The other ninja clans of Naruto deserved better, really.\n\nI remember hoping for more Hyuuga world-building after meeting Neji in the Chuunin Exam and meeting Hinata and Neji again after the timeskip. I thought it would be a great way to really introduce making Hinata and Naruto friends - through learning about her clan and how Neji has found a way to thrive despite its shackles. I was, of course, devastatingly wrong. Kept waiting for other clans beside the Uchiha to get a turn, to no avail.\n\nThe Hyuuga\u2019s seem like even bigger \u201cblood purists\u201d than the Uchiha\u2019s give the air of, so I doubt it. I also doubt the Senju would be too chill about the Main/Side Branch thing, too. I think they became parts of civilian families for the most part, and some minor clans like the Ino-Shika-Chou.

They\u2019re not the only clan in Konoha that might have intermingled with others, either - the Ino-Shika-Chou is a group I think would most likely do something similar, but _they_ are still around, and they seemed smaller than the Senju, so why aren\u2019t the Senju?

They were still raised as siblings and cousins - family you can still reach out to. Tsunade seemed so isolated with Hashirama and Tobirama as her only family connections other than Nawaki. No other uncles, aunts, or cousins she was raised with, and presumably parents that died early on. This would make more sense if the Senju had already been getting pretty small by the countries founding, and it wasn\u2019t.\n\nI\u2019m fine with Sakura emulating her because I\u2019m sick and tired of the only \u201cgood\u201d ninjas coming from insane legacies.

It also reminds me of how we used to think Sakura could be a poison/illusion specialist before Tsunade seriously entered the narrative. What a time.\n\nThe headcanon makes the best sense out of the nonsensical writing of _why_ the Senju were wiped out during peace times, for sure. The other ninja clans of Naruto deserved better, really.\n\nI remember hoping for more Hyuuga world-building after meeting Neji in the Chuunin Exam and meeting Hinata and Neji again after the timeskip. I thought it would be a great way to really introduce making Hinata and Naruto friends - through learning about her clan and how Neji has found a way to thrive despite its shackles. I was, of course, devastatingly wrong. Kept waiting for other clans beside the Uchiha to get a turn, to no avail.\n\nThe Hyuuga\u2019s seem like even bigger \u201cblood purists\u201d than the Uchiha\u2019s give the air of, so I doubt it. I also doubt the Senju would be too chill about the Main/Side Branch thing, too. I think they became parts of civilian families for the most part, and some minor clans like the Ino-Shika-Chou.

Everyone would be paying a lot of attention to Senju descendants.\n\nI\u2019m more confused how they don\u2019t keep up a community with each other, same name or not. They were still raised as siblings and cousins - family you can still reach out to. Tsunade seemed so isolated with Hashirama and Tobirama as her only family connections other than Nawaki. No other uncles, aunts, or cousins she was raised with, and presumably parents that died early on. This would make more sense if the Senju had already been getting pretty small by the countries founding, and it wasn\u2019t.\n\nI\u2019m fine with Sakura emulating her because I\u2019m sick and tired of the only \u201cgood\u201d ninjas coming from insane legacies.

The other ninja clans of Naruto deserved better, really.\n\nI remember hoping for more Hyuuga world-building after meeting Neji in the Chuunin Exam and meeting Hinata and Neji again after the timeskip. I thought it would be a great way to really introduce making Hinata and Naruto friends - through learning about her clan and how Neji has found a way to thrive despite its shackles. I was, of course, devastatingly wrong. Kept waiting for other clans beside the Uchiha to get a turn, to no avail.\n\nThe Hyuuga\u2019s seem like even bigger \u201cblood purists\u201d than the Uchiha\u2019s give the air of, so I doubt it. I also doubt the Senju would be too chill about the Main/Side Branch thing, too. I think they became parts of civilian families for the most part, and some minor clans like the Ino-Shika-Chou.

They\u2019re not the only clan in Konoha that might have intermingled with others, either - the Ino-Shika-Chou is a group I think would most likely do something similar, but _they_ are still around, and they seemed smaller than the Senju, so why aren\u2019t the Senju? The Senju were just unnecessarily written out of the story and there isn\u2019t a lot of reasonable excuses to make sense of it - or rather, there shouldn\u2019t have to be.\n\nEdit: the last line",

The other ninja clans of Naruto deserved better, really.\n\nI remember hoping for more Hyuuga world-building after meeting Neji in the Chuunin Exam and meeting Hinata and Neji again after the timeskip. I thought it would be a great way to really introduce making Hinata and Naruto friends - through learning about her clan and how Neji has found a way to thrive despite its shackles. I was, of course, devastatingly wrong. Kept waiting for other clans beside the Uchiha to get a turn, to no avail.\n\nThe Hyuuga\u2019s seem like even bigger \u201cblood purists\u201d than the Uchiha\u2019s give the air of, so I doubt it. I also doubt the Senju would be too chill about the Main/Side Branch thing, too. I think they became parts of civilian families for the most part, and some minor clans like the Ino-Shika-Chou.

It also reminds me of how we used to think Sakura could be a poison/illusion specialist before Tsunade seriously entered the narrative. What a time.\n\nThe headcanon makes the best sense out of the nonsensical writing of _why_ the Senju were wiped out during peace times, for sure. The other ninja clans of Naruto deserved better, really.\n\nI remember hoping for more Hyuuga world-building after meeting Neji in the Chuunin Exam and meeting Hinata and Neji again after the timeskip. I thought it would be a great way to really introduce making Hinata and Naruto friends - through learning about her clan and how Neji has found a way to thrive despite its shackles. I was, of course, devastatingly wrong. Kept waiting for other clans beside the Uchiha to get a turn, to no avail.\n\nThe Hyuuga\u2019s seem like even bigger \u201cblood purists\u201d than the Uchiha\u2019s give the air of, so I doubt it. I also doubt the Senju would be too chill about the Main/Side Branch thing, too. I think they became parts of civilian families for the most part, and some minor clans like the Ino-Shika-Chou. They seem chill enough to mingle with.",
