    "body": "So I'm an late 40s SB and though I've had some great ongoing SR that were PPM based, I recently met someone (through this board) and it's super awesome! We agreed biweekly allowance and I just got my first transfer. \nHe's substantially younger than me and very sweet, intelligent and a genuinely good person.  We work close to each other, which is awesome to see each other often.  He's someone I'd be friends with anyway so it's all around amazing!\nI'm loving walking around with this shit eating grin on my face all day after our lunch time fun!!",
