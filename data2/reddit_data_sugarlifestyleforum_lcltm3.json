    "body": "Gather round my sweet, new and green SBs, I've noticed a few posts from newbies mentioning the hated word 'transactional' and how they or the POT/SDs they've encountered have used this word to highlight what they don't want in the SR. However, sometimes the word is thrown about to gaslight, shame, or bait and switch an SB to accepting a move to vanilla territory.   \nI've also seen  'Transactional' mixed up with 'Treating the SR like a job' so lets discuss the fundamental differences...\n\nMost importantly, yes, you should absolutely treat your SR like a job and by that I mean:   \nDon't be late, you wouldn't show up to your office an hour late because you got 'caught up with friends' so don't do it to your SD.  \nDon't flake on dates or cancel at the last moment..again you wouldn't randomly not show up at work.  \nDon't be constantly on your phone..it's just plain rude.  \nBe clean and groomed..nobody likes a stinky SB.  \nBe engaged, attentive, polite, respectful and interested while you are with your SD...don't knock back the wine, throw up on his furniture or ask him does he have any drugs....do that in the office and it's straight to HR.  \nBe grateful and appreciate gifts..never demand!  you wouldn't walk into your bosses office, point to a picture of an LV bag on your phone and scream ''buy me this!!!!!!''   \nSo yes, it is a job BUT it should be the best job! A job were you are tingling with excitement and so amazingly happy to have it..were you feel cherished , adored and respected and if you are not then girl, it's time to quit or start job hunting.   \nIf you are doing the above then an SD cannot claim the SR is transactional, what you are doing is treating the SR with the respect it deserves. \n\nTransactional: 2 hours of hotel shagging when he didn't even have the decency to pop the kettle on first.    \nIf you're not even getting a cuppa and engaged interest in you as a person, then yes, its transactional. \n\nThank you for coming to my TED talk..",

I had an SB disappear for 2 days after buying her a car, because she was \"showing it off to friends and family\" (literally after leaving the car dealer). These were not meet & greets these were established SR's. It never seems to fail that there comes a time that the SB becomes so comfortable, and confident, in the SR that errors in judgement start to surface. Bonds for DUI's, tickets for needed car upkeep and repairs not being taken care of after asking for help, $3,000.00 Toll road fines, etc.\n\nI've had 1 SB finish college and get a good job through our SR, and at least a dozen succumb to irresponsible behavior that ruins a golden opportunity.\n\nMy only advice is just try and do your best to see the SR lifestyle for it's potential. I've heard horrible stories about SD's being controlling and manipulative just as many times I've lived through my own stories. SD's are not perfect either. Prone to having to never explain themselves or to empathize with the SB.\n\nKnow your worth, but try to bring your SD as much joy as you can and it can be rewarding.",

I had an SB disappear for 2 days after buying her a car, because she was \"showing it off to friends and family\" (literally after leaving the car dealer). These were not meet & greets these were established SR's. It never seems to fail that there comes a time that the SB becomes so comfortable, and confident, in the SR that errors in judgement start to surface. Bonds for DUI's, tickets for needed car upkeep and repairs not being taken care of after asking for help, $3,000.00 Toll road fines, etc.\n\nI've had 1 SB finish college and get a good job through our SR, and at least a dozen succumb to irresponsible behavior that ruins a golden opportunity.\n\nMy only advice is just try and do your best to see the SR lifestyle for it's potential. I've heard horrible stories about SD's being controlling and manipulative just as many times I've lived through my own stories. SD's are not perfect either. Prone to having to never explain themselves or to empathize with the SB.\n\nKnow your worth, but try to bring your SD as much joy as you can and it can be rewarding.",

I had an SB disappear for 2 days after buying her a car, because she was \"showing it off to friends and family\" (literally after leaving the car dealer). These were not meet & greets these were established SR's. It never seems to fail that there comes a time that the SB becomes so comfortable, and confident, in the SR that errors in judgement start to surface. Bonds for DUI's, tickets for needed car upkeep and repairs not being taken care of after asking for help, $3,000.00 Toll road fines, etc.\n\nI've had 1 SB finish college and get a good job through our SR, and at least a dozen succumb to irresponsible behavior that ruins a golden opportunity.\n\nMy only advice is just try and do your best to see the SR lifestyle for it's potential. I've heard horrible stories about SD's being controlling and manipulative just as many times I've lived through my own stories. SD's are not perfect either. Prone to having to never explain themselves or to empathize with the SB.\n\nKnow your worth, but try to bring your SD as much joy as you can and it can be rewarding.",
