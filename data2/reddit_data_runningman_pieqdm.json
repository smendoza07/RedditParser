But I have been so so shocked by the amount and severity of vitriol spewed at her (and even her brother!!) online. I genuinely don\u2019t understand how she handles it and I\u2019m grateful the members seem to adore and support her, and that she\u2019s finding such success in Sixth Sense too. \n\nIt\u2019s been so nice to find such a lovely pocket of the fandom here and I wish I\u2019d found it sooner. Hoping for continued success for all the members and that one day, the Somin haters recognize they aren\u2019t helping or accomplishing anything\u2026",

We will be enforcing this rule very strictly, especially on this thread.\n\nThe very reason why this sub is \"a breath of fresh air\" is that the moderating team does not tolerate toxicity of any kind. Remember, using **anecdotal observations from outside this sub/platform/thread to form an inflammatory comment about another fanbase or another member is not allowed**. \n\nSo-min is a beautiful and talented individual and is deserving of so much praise. **We can all appreciate her without the need to bring down others**. If you feel a cycle of toxicity surrounding So-min, you need to actively break it **by drowning it out with praise and love**, not by adding in more toxicity.\n\nAddendum:\n\nTo clarify, I am not telling you to turn a blind eye to toxicity. **Call it out,** **right there and then**! If you see it on the social media platforms that you frequent, call it out and report it. If you see it in this sub, report it right away and we will deal with it.",

She was outgoing, funny, had great chemistry with all the members and didn't give a damn about her image. It's everything you'd want from a variety entertainer. The reason people laud and adore Kwangsoo was somehow also the reason Somin gets hated on. \n\nAnother reason was people saying she stole Jihyo's screentime. I mean, I love Jihyo too but do you really expect her to get plenty of screentime when she normally just stands quietly at the sides and barely participates in banter and challenges (at least, at the time)? \n\nI remember that RM's and Somin personal Ig was bombarded with hate messages for Somin asking her to leave the show. It was just really sad. It's a lot better now, I barely see any hate messages on their Ig anymore. I hope she stays on RM for a long time if only just to piss of the haters.",

It was extra frustrating to me because in my opinion, Jihyo seems to really value having another woman around! And while Somin teases her and competes with her during games, she respectfully defers to her quite often (more often than she does other members!). One of my favorite episodes was when Jihyo was the mother zombie and Somin was her assistant and you could see Somin took such delight in helping her win. \n\nIn early days, I sort of wished Jihyo more publicly supported her but I recognize now that probably would have fanned the flames.

I like when she goes all in during skits and role playing no matter how many people kept saying how cheesy it was. \n\nOn the surface, she might be the physically weakest member but I think she has a spine of steel, not giving in to the pressure to change herself. She shown that being a girly girl who likes pretty things does not affect your ability to do your job really well, and inspired me to be more self-assured in myself.",

I remember she would be so tired and the members saying she's especially sensitive when she's filming something. So instead of hating Somin, who is so lovely and so positive, I realize that she, along with the other members were helping Jihyo. It wasn't that she was getting more screen time, I think at times Jihyo was really too exhausted a few times and they edited to show more of Somin being upbeat than Jihyo looking tired. Perception is everything,  I don't understand why people choose to be hateful.",

Rarely have I seen the same kind of hate or vitriol spewed at him that has been directed toward Somin. For Sechan, it\u2019s been about how he interacts with the group and whether he is filling a necessary role. I love them both but do think it took him longer to find his voice.
