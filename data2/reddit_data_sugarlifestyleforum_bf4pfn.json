    "body": "So I matched with a college girl on Tinder she was very upfront about looking for PPM. We chatted a little bit and takes about a M&G. She then asked if she could ask me a question. \n\n\u201cDaddy, I\u2019m at a track meet and am hungry, could you send me some money so I can eat?\u201d\n\nI responded, \u201cSorry, no. I don\u2019t send money to people I\u2019ve never met. Once we\u2019ve met and agreed to an arrangement, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s something I\u2019d be happy to do. Hope you understand.\u201d\n\nShe replied, \u201cthat was a test to see if you\u2019re a real sugar daddy, you failed. I\u2019m blocking you.\u201d\n\nMade me laugh. No real sugar daddy would send money to someone they haven\u2019t met. There are way to many scammers and liars out there. \n\nAnyone else experienced anything like this?",

They don\u2019t always accept or understand the mutually beneficial part. Or they think that your benefit comes simply from getting an ounce of their attention. Then when it comes down to having a physical relationship with a man their dad\u2019s age, they change the story really quick. \n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m young and beautiful and he\u2019d be lucky to even talk to me.\u201d \n\nYeah ok. I\u2019m 30 and beautiful and not only will he enjoy talking to me but I\u2019ll do things to him that are illegal in a few countries. \n\nAt least she showed her colors early on and didn\u2019t waste your time. Best of luck out there OP!",

After a pout and firm no, they turned around and took their shoes to the cashier and put them on another guys house account.   \n\nNeither were friendly when we bumped into each other an another event later in the day.

They don\u2019t always accept or understand the mutually beneficial part. Or they think that your benefit comes simply from getting an ounce of their attention. Then when it comes down to having a physical relationship with a man their dad\u2019s age, they change the story really quick. \n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m young and beautiful and he\u2019d be lucky to even talk to me.\u201d \n\nYeah ok. I\u2019m 30 and beautiful and not only will he enjoy talking to me but I\u2019ll do things to him that are illegal in a few countries. \n\nAt least she showed her colors early on and didn\u2019t waste your time.
