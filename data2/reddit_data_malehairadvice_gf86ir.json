                    "body": "One thing I've found is that the longer your beard is, the less noticible patchy spots are. I have a few patchy spots on the right side that aren't too noticible at any length above 5mm.\nWhile genetics play a big part, simply having a longer beard can hide patchy spots. The key is to make sure it looks neat and well groomed - so don't let it go everywhere like in my first pic! \n\nTo get the mustache trimmed, I usually go in at about a 45\u00b0 angle for the portion that isn't in line with your nose, and then up and away for the part underneath it. You may hit your nose(believe me, I have a thicc one!) or have to adjust the guard, but with repeated movements plus trial and error you will get the length you want. \n\nAnother thing to take into account is that a lot of guys(myself included) have one or more sections of the face that grow in thicker. On my face, the \"goatee\" section as well as top sideburns are thicker.  So to get a uniform look in terms of beard shade I'd cut the sides to 5mm, sideburns to 4mm and goatee to 3-4mm. I didn't do that for this pic, but cutting that way makes the whole beard look the same length because the shading looks the same. You'll have to do this every day or two for upkeep\n\nAnother thing to do that I didn't do before this pic (I was too lazy after the haircut) is go in and shape it with a razor or no-guard trimmer. That will make sure everything looks uniform in terms of corners and edges, especially around the mouth and mustache. \n\nYour mileage may vary, these are things that have worked for me.",

I want to give some tips on caring for a beard for those who want to achieve the same results.  \n\u2022        Wash Your Beard With a Natural Shampoo for Men.  \nMake sure to wash your beard with a men\u2019s natural shampoo 2 \u2013 3x a week. This will keep your beard clean, smelling great, and prevent any build up from accumulating in your beard (sweat or excess oil). Your beard\u2019s hair is no different than the hair on top of your face.  \n\u2022        Keep Your Beard Hydrated and Conditioned.  \nTo keep your beard soft and shiny, it\u2019s essential you use a beard oil to condition the beard and keep up its shine. The best beard oil uses natural ingredients, as well as premium essential oils & extracts.  \n\u2022        Trimming Your Beard.  \nTrimming is essential beard care to keeping your beard looking well kept and healthy. Keep your beard trim using scissors instead of trimmers. Trimmers can more easily create splits ends and scissors allow you to more fine tune your beard\u2019s shape.  \n\u2022        Trimming Your Neckline.  \nThe one case where you can and should use a trimmer is around your beard neck line. We suggest trimming this bi-weekly as well. To do this, take two fingers and put them on your Adam\u2019s apple.  \n\u2022        Be Healthy.  \nYour beard, hair, and skin are direct reflections of your inner health. If you want a thick, healthy beard, you need to exercise, eat well, sleep well and limit alcohol.  \n\n\nI hope I helped with my advices to those who would like to have the same beautiful beard!)",

            "body": "One thing I've found is that the longer your beard is, the less noticible patchy spots are. I have a few patchy spots on the right side that aren't too noticible at any length above 5mm.\nWhile genetics play a big part, simply having a longer beard can hide patchy spots. The key is to make sure it looks neat and well groomed - so don't let it go everywhere like in my first pic! \n\nTo get the mustache trimmed, I usually go in at about a 45\u00b0 angle for the portion that isn't in line with your nose, and then up and away for the part underneath it. You may hit your nose(believe me, I have a thicc one!) or have to adjust the guard, but with repeated movements plus trial and error you will get the length you want. \n\nAnother thing to take into account is that a lot of guys(myself included) have one or more sections of the face that grow in thicker. On my face, the \"goatee\" section as well as top sideburns are thicker.  So to get a uniform look in terms of beard shade I'd cut the sides to 5mm, sideburns to 4mm and goatee to 3-4mm. I didn't do that for this pic, but cutting that way makes the whole beard look the same length because the shading looks the same. You'll have to do this every day or two for upkeep\n\nAnother thing to do that I didn't do before this pic (I was too lazy after the haircut) is go in and shape it with a razor or no-guard trimmer. That will make sure everything looks uniform in terms of corners and edges, especially around the mouth and mustache. \n\nYour mileage may vary, these are things that have worked for me.",
