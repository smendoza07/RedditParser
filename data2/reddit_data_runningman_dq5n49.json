    "body": "So I decided to post here because I thought some other fans might find it interesting. Earlier I went to Hongdae and I saw some stage for a campaign for better privacy of phone carriers (?). I don't fully understand the issue, but Somin was on stage talking about it and giving out prizes. She also took pictures with volunteers. There weren't that many people so I decided to stay for a bit and after she was done I got a short moment to talk to her. She seemed genuinely excited that there are foreign fans of her, took the patience of speaking a bit slower so I could understand and tried her best to calm me a bit. And even though it was just a few minutes I could really feel she was a warm person and enjoyed what she was doing. I wish I could've talked a bit more but she got kinda rushed by her manager or some other staff",

Going through the underground parking lot where you don't have to meet anyone except staff and going through the street or parking lot where you will get seen and meet a lot of fans. So if they want to get left alone, they have the choice to do so. But a lot of groups choose so they can chat with their fans (a smaller group chatted with their fans in front of the car after the performance even though they where obviously tired because muba has an insane schedule)",

She was out in public, sure, but that doesn't mean she has to perform to your specifications just because. Did you maybe think she was out in public because of the interview, and was planning to retreat immediately afterwards and go through the private exist to not have to speak with people?\n\nPlus, seeing fans waving and saying \"hi\" or whatever is very different from a stranger actually coming up to you, through/past your people to speak to you.\n\nBasically, you lacked appropriate situational awareness, and now you're trying to make it her fault for not taking the private exit.",
