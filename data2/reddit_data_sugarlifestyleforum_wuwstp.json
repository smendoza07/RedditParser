Men you're just as replaceable as us SB's. Please remember that when you forget our birthdays because if I wanted disrespect I would be with a man my own age!\ud83d\ude0a\n\nEdit: y'all being upset has me cracking up in the airport right now. Like it's really not that deep! My ex-SD isn't even on Reddit. Nobody is talking about you so don't worry\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23",

Different expectations and level of play for different divisions. Not saying that if you don\u2019t get your SB a gift you\u2019re a John, but in some SR styles it\u2019s expected and precedent that both partners swap something for birthdays.\n\nMy SDs always have gifted me something equal to a months allowance (which I am always grateful for), and I\u2019d gift them something in return on their birthdays.\n\nEven amongst SRs that have ended, I\u2019ll still get a cute gift like a le labo perfume or dyson vacuum or something on birthdays and christmases, and one of them I\u2019ll still see when I go to London (where they live) for dinner or something nice (platonic no PPM of course). And many of my friends who also sugar experience the same! \n\nPeople have to keep in mind that not every SR is following the same mores.\n\nAnd SBs, always remember to get your SD something spicy and thoughtful for their birthdays too if they remember yours! Your experience should be respectful and reciprocal :))\n\nAs for the title of the post, everyone CAN be replaced, but not everyone SHOULD be. A replacement can be of lower or higher quality-make wise judgements.",

I'm letting him know I'm not one and that he's talking to the wrong girl. It's a fact that most people can barely afford to pay their rent working a minimum wage job at McDonald's correct? Hence why I used that as an example. You act like I'm out here spitting and cussing out McDonald's workers. Something I would never do because I know when to walk away from any situation that I don't like (example: my SD). So please explain to me how I've made a McDonald's workers life harder today because last time I checked I'm always polite with all workers.",

Different expectations and level of play for different divisions. Not saying that if you don\u2019t get your SB a gift you\u2019re a John, but in some SR styles it\u2019s expected and precedent that both partners swap something for birthdays.\n\nMy SDs always have gifted me something equal to a months allowance (which I am always grateful for), and I\u2019d gift them something in return on their birthdays.\n\nEven amongst SRs that have ended, I\u2019ll still get a cute gift like a le labo perfume or dyson vacuum or something on birthdays and christmases, and one of them I\u2019ll still see when I go to London (where they live) for dinner or something nice (platonic no PPM of course). And many of my friends who also sugar experience the same! \n\nPeople have to keep in mind that not every SR is following the same mores.\n\nAnd SBs, always remember to get your SD something spicy and thoughtful for their birthdays too if they remember yours! Your experience should be respectful and reciprocal :))\n\nAs for the title of the post, everyone CAN be replaced, but not everyone SHOULD be.

That's what a boyfriend would do.\n\nIf it's your anniversary, you better not forget. Boyfriends are expected to remember.\n\nBoyfriends respond to texts and make plans with you in a reasonable timeframe.\n\nHowever, if an SD needs help moving, I sincerely doubt the average SB is gonna be going down to U-Haul to rent a truck and help his ass \ud83e\udd23",

Not saying that if you don\u2019t get your SB a gift you\u2019re a John, but in some SR styles it\u2019s expected and precedent that both partners swap something for birthdays.\n\nMy SDs always have gifted me something equal to a months allowance (which I am always grateful for), and I\u2019d gift them something in return on their birthdays.\n\nEven amongst SRs that have ended, I\u2019ll still get a cute gift like a le labo perfume or dyson vacuum or something on birthdays and christmases, and one of them I\u2019ll still see when I go to London (where they live) for dinner or something nice (platonic no PPM of course). And many of my friends who also sugar experience the same! \n\nPeople have to keep in mind that not every SR is following the same mores.\n\nAnd SBs, always remember to get your SD something spicy and thoughtful for their birthdays too if they remember yours!

And many of my friends who also sugar experience the same! \n\nPeople have to keep in mind that not every SR is following the same mores.\n\nAnd SBs, always remember to get your SD something spicy and thoughtful for their birthdays too if they remember yours!

You're a year older in an artificially constructed measure of time based on where we happen to be in the universe. Celebrate it. Don't celebrate it.
