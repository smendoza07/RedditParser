Boruto makes it harder to skip, or it feels like, because it tries to mask those filler arcs as relevant to the story. Sometimes the only way to tell if a boruto arc is filler or not is if it's *good* or not (Again, only going off my 3 season knowledge, which I would say the 1st and 3rd seasons/arcs were pretty horrible but the second was solid so came from the manga?)",
