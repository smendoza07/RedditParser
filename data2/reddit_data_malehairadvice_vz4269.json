It doesn\u2019t cost too much to have done and a general rule of thumb is that dress pants should _just_ touch the top of your shoe.\n\nGood luck buddy!",

Looks like that\u2019s a shirt and tie combo straight out of a department store plastic wrap package. Whip out that iron and and get those creases and wrinkles out! On the tie too!\n\nFor hair man I would grab some pomade and slick it back until you\u2019re back at home with your barber, or use some mousse and apply wet and style it back with a blow drier. Hotel might even have some pomade depending. \n\nIf that\u2019s not an option I\u2019d ask for travel hair spray and blow dry up and to the side and keep the part. Kill it out there you got options",

As other people said, check out a tailor, its surprisingly cheap and can make you look so fresh. The break (the point where your pants touch your shoes) is a fairly old style, it should be easy to have them taken in. Similar for the shirt - first, make sure you're ironing them bad boys so there're no wrinkles, but you could shoot for a nice trim tailoring. Shoulders look good on the shirt. Lastly, the tie - tie should just kiss the top of the belt, you could use another inch or so on your knot.\n\nSecond, the hair. It looks like you have nice, fair, flat hair. You're also a sturdier build. In general, if you're a sturdier guy and can grow a beard, I'd recommend it. But if you can't, no worries.

Hotel might even have some pomade depending. \n\nIf that\u2019s not an option I\u2019d ask for travel hair spray and blow dry up and to the side and keep the part. Kill it out there you got options",
