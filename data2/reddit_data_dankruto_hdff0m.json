Part of the brilliance of the seal Minato used on Naruto was that it allowed some chakra to leak to Naruto to be able to use and increased his chakra reserves. Does anyone know if that ability is unique to Naruto since he has a seal from a clan that was renowned for their sealing jutsu? Like do others only get to use Jinchuriki powers if they go to a tailed beast state? I could see it go either way especially since the reason the Uzumaki clan was decimated and scattered was all the nations scrambling to get sealing jutsu from them to use for Jinchuriki",

Part of the brilliance of the seal Minato used on Naruto was that it allowed some chakra to leak to Naruto to be able to use and increased his chakra reserves. Does anyone know if that ability is unique to Naruto since he has a seal from a clan that was renowned for their sealing jutsu? Like do others only get to use Jinchuriki powers if they go to a tailed beast state? I could see it go either way especially since the reason the Uzumaki clan was decimated and scattered was all the nations scrambling to get sealing jutsu from them to use for Jinchuriki",

Part of the brilliance of the seal Minato used on Naruto was that it allowed some chakra to leak to Naruto to be able to use and increased his chakra reserves. Does anyone know if that ability is unique to Naruto since he has a seal from a clan that was renowned for their sealing jutsu? Like do others only get to use Jinchuriki powers if they go to a tailed beast state? I could see it go either way especially since the reason the Uzumaki clan was decimated and scattered was all the nations scrambling to get sealing jutsu from them to use for Jinchuriki",
