                            "body": "The process of perming hair is by more or less forcing the hair to hold in a certain shape. This is achieved first by creating the desired effects with perm rods, which forms the curl or wave. Perm rods are color coded by size, which is a universal coding. Once the hair is rolled into the desired shape determined by your stylist, they then apply the perm solution. The solution is a rancid smelling liquid that breaks the disulfide bond in the hair. The hair has 3 bonds that each effect the hair in a certain way. The first bond is the hydrogen bond. This is a bond broken by water and heat. This is the primary bond in our hair's overall shape. The breaking of the hydrogen bond is why you shouldn't brush wet hair, because hair is more fragile when wet. The second bond is the salt bond. This accounts for 1/3 of our hairs overall strength.\nThe third is the disulfide bond, the bond affected in the perm process. This is a key bond in how hair lays longterm.  The perm solution comes in 2 key forms. Acidic, and Alkaline. The hair has a pH balance of about 5.0. An alkaline perm solution has a pH balance between 8.2 and 9.6, and is a stronger, but more damaging solution to the hair. Any sort of bleached hair is not a good candidate for an alkaline perm, as it can literally melt the hair off. But if your hair is virgin, i.e. not chemically altered in any previous way, your hair will be just fine with the heavier alkaline solution. Acid perm solution has a pH of around 4.5. To 6.5 and is a gentler solution, also great for releasing the curls overtime into gentle waves. After your hair has been processed. You will be rinsed out, and a neutralizing lotion will be applied. After 5 minutes, the rods are removed and the hair patted dry. The next 3 days is critical. NO washing, or getting the hair wet. NO blowdrying or styling products, and NO brushing. They will tell you 48 hours, I always recommend 72 for best results. After this period, you can wash it and style it as normal. The hair will hold and regain curl as it gets wet. If properly cared for, you can get about 3 to 6 months of great styles before it might be time to get it repermed. Lol kind of got in depth there, but i hope i provided you with enough info to make the right choice for you and what you're looking for.",

Try air drying your hair, when your hair is wet and naturally curly you can achieve this style with damp hair and let it air dry and it\u2019ll have similar shape. Also do not blow dry without a diffuser. Blow drying will just mess your curls up. You can use a clay to give some hold but I haven\u2019t used product in my hair in years and still can get it to stay up.",

                    "body": "The process of perming hair is by more or less forcing the hair to hold in a certain shape. This is achieved first by creating the desired effects with perm rods, which forms the curl or wave. Perm rods are color coded by size, which is a universal coding. Once the hair is rolled into the desired shape determined by your stylist, they then apply the perm solution. The solution is a rancid smelling liquid that breaks the disulfide bond in the hair. The hair has 3 bonds that each effect the hair in a certain way. The first bond is the hydrogen bond. This is a bond broken by water and heat. This is the primary bond in our hair's overall shape. The breaking of the hydrogen bond is why you shouldn't brush wet hair, because hair is more fragile when wet. The second bond is the salt bond. This accounts for 1/3 of our hairs overall strength.\nThe third is the disulfide bond, the bond affected in the perm process. This is a key bond in how hair lays longterm.  The perm solution comes in 2 key forms. Acidic, and Alkaline. The hair has a pH balance of about 5.0. An alkaline perm solution has a pH balance between 8.2 and 9.6, and is a stronger, but more damaging solution to the hair. Any sort of bleached hair is not a good candidate for an alkaline perm, as it can literally melt the hair off. But if your hair is virgin, i.e. not chemically altered in any previous way, your hair will be just fine with the heavier alkaline solution. Acid perm solution has a pH of around 4.5. To 6.5 and is a gentler solution, also great for releasing the curls overtime into gentle waves. After your hair has been processed. You will be rinsed out, and a neutralizing lotion will be applied. After 5 minutes, the rods are removed and the hair patted dry. The next 3 days is critical. NO washing, or getting the hair wet. NO blowdrying or styling products, and NO brushing. They will tell you 48 hours, I always recommend 72 for best results. After this period, you can wash it and style it as normal. The hair will hold and regain curl as it gets wet. If properly cared for, you can get about 3 to 6 months of great styles before it might be time to get it repermed. Lol kind of got in depth there, but i hope i provided you with enough info to make the right choice for you and what you're looking for.",

            "body": "The process of perming hair is by more or less forcing the hair to hold in a certain shape. This is achieved first by creating the desired effects with perm rods, which forms the curl or wave. Perm rods are color coded by size, which is a universal coding. Once the hair is rolled into the desired shape determined by your stylist, they then apply the perm solution. The solution is a rancid smelling liquid that breaks the disulfide bond in the hair. The hair has 3 bonds that each effect the hair in a certain way. The first bond is the hydrogen bond. This is a bond broken by water and heat. This is the primary bond in our hair's overall shape. The breaking of the hydrogen bond is why you shouldn't brush wet hair, because hair is more fragile when wet. The second bond is the salt bond. This accounts for 1/3 of our hairs overall strength.\nThe third is the disulfide bond, the bond affected in the perm process. This is a key bond in how hair lays longterm.  The perm solution comes in 2 key forms. Acidic, and Alkaline. The hair has a pH balance of about 5.0. An alkaline perm solution has a pH balance between 8.2 and 9.6, and is a stronger, but more damaging solution to the hair. Any sort of bleached hair is not a good candidate for an alkaline perm, as it can literally melt the hair off. But if your hair is virgin, i.e. not chemically altered in any previous way, your hair will be just fine with the heavier alkaline solution. Acid perm solution has a pH of around 4.5. To 6.5 and is a gentler solution, also great for releasing the curls overtime into gentle waves. After your hair has been processed. You will be rinsed out, and a neutralizing lotion will be applied. After 5 minutes, the rods are removed and the hair patted dry. The next 3 days is critical. NO washing, or getting the hair wet. NO blowdrying or styling products, and NO brushing. They will tell you 48 hours, I always recommend 72 for best results. After this period, you can wash it and style it as normal. The hair will hold and regain curl as it gets wet. If properly cared for, you can get about 3 to 6 months of great styles before it might be time to get it repermed. Lol kind of got in depth there, but i hope i provided you with enough info to make the right choice for you and what you're looking for.",
