    "body": "I just wanted to say thanks to this sub, because as a young girl who also has some issues with self esteem I can be pretty naive. Reading the different posts on here (basically everyday) has shown me all the different ways guys do try to manipulate the different situations. \n\nHere\u2019s one that just happened. I went on a M&G with this one guy (not going to call him and SD) and then we planned on meeting after I came back from my university reading week, but when I started discussing allowance with him it was immediate red flags. First he gave me an escort-type of allowance ($XXX for 90 minutes, $XXX for 3 hours, etc). I immediately said no, because I\u2019m NOT an escort and I asked for the allowance that I always ask for. He then said sure, but for the first 2 weeks he would give me a \u201creduced\u201d PPM (less than half of what I asked for) to see if we have \u201cchemistry\u201d. Lol. I quickly figured out he was definitely just going to give me this low allowance and then ghost me after 2 weeks, and even if he didn\u2019t plan on ghosting me I was not going to take the risk of that happening, or negotiate my worth. \n\nThanks to this sub I can get a pretty good picture of if a guy is planning on using me even if they SEEM really nice. I need to work on just blocking them immediately, instead of continuing to waste my time talking to them.",

You ever heard the phrase, \"misery loves company\"? These SB's should be ashamed of yourselves, knowing the torment that being a prostitute has caused you (and yes no matter which way you spin it, its prostitution. maybe a legal loophole, but common sense prevails), you should be advising this young girl to take a different route, not fueling the facade that this is a lavish and high class title. Reality is, these sugar daddies will never care about you if you are not giving them some form of sexual reprieve, and just the same, you don't truly care for the. OP, go live your dreams, right now you're just creating a nightmare. Don't listen to these other girls, they are simply making themselves feel better by trying to grow and normalize this phenomenon but the blind can't lead the blind. I just have one question to anyone who disagrees..... if you are an SD or an SB; and in real life you had a daughter, how would you feel about her being a Sugar Baby?  For those of you who say you don't put out sexually and think they are hustlers as a result.... you're nothing but a beggar, trying to freeload of another man's success.     \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHopefully moderator has a conscious and does't delete this comment that could help someone.",
