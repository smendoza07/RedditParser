All memories, battle experience, knowledge, emotions, etc combine back into the original after the jutsu  is released. This includes FATIGUE. So if you make too many clones, not only can the lack of chakra kill you, but the fatigue from all clones combined can also kill you \n\nPart of Naruto\u2019s chakra nature training involved him splitting up into hundreds of clones to practice, resulting in him finishing training at a laughable fraction of the amount of time it would\u2019ve taken a single person. \n\nAs such, Naruto is capable of learning anything he could ever want to learn by splitting himself up and letting clones accumulate the experience as well. What would take a normal person a lifetime to master, could take Naruto a week",

You could argue that he gets little sleep and that\u2019s why he\u2019s so tired\n\nMy assumption is that he has little to no sleep, is already at a certain fatigue limit, therefor only uses clones sparingly to do little things like check up on someone, or do an interview for tv \n\nAs to why he doesn\u2019t let his real body be home with his family while the clone is at the office, I do not know. Maybe because he wants his real self to be responsible for the village, or maybe because any sudden information about issues is better heard by the real brain instead of a clone brain that would have to be released to get to the real body\n\nThat, or it\u2019s just so essential to the plot of \u201cneglectful dad, sad son\u201d that they ignore any logic",

Much more than any regular person. This is the only real reason he can use the multi-shadow-clone jutsu like he does \n\nLook into the chakra nature training with kakashi. If I remember correctly, this is when Naruto used this clone shortcut to train himself at a record pace. He split into hundreds of clones and made them all train with him, then he accumulated the experience  (and fatigue) each time he released the jutsu",

I play a ton of games, the measure of whether or not a 13 year old plays a game or not doesn't determine how good a game is. \n\nEdit: trans stuff\nI have a bunch of friends that are trans or genderqueer. I love them despite the fact that I think they are delusional and have co occurring mental disorders. I don't care if you think that makes me hateful or \"phobic\" just because I don't agree with your worldview that a person can identify as something they are not. If I were to tell you I identify as black even if my skin is white, and I say you are racist or \"trans-race-phobic\" how would that sit with you",

The trade-off, presumably, is the massively increased chakra cost. Naruto lacks the concentration and focus to use standard shadow clones, which is why they immediately fall apart, but can brute force the more powerful technique.",

To add to the fact is that >!he's a reincarnate of Ashura,the only other one being hashirama!< ,whose summons make kyuubi look like a fckin doll.\n\nNaruto,on his own has enough chakra than anyone to have ever been born(remember half of kyuubi's chakra was sealed inside naruto, hours after he was born,while hosts are typically in their early teens during the sealing).\n\nThe only anomaly is gaara but you'd guess shikaku,having the smallest chakra reserves of all could very well be managed,not to mention gaara himself has decent reserves for a kage.",

So if you make too many clones, not only can the lack of chakra kill you, but the fatigue from all clones combined can also kill you \n\nPart of Naruto\u2019s chakra nature training involved him splitting up into hundreds of clones to practice, resulting in him finishing training at a laughable fraction of the amount of time it would\u2019ve taken a single person. \n\nAs such, Naruto is capable of learning anything he could ever want to learn by splitting himself up and letting clones accumulate the experience as well.

Maybe because he wants his real self to be responsible for the village, or maybe because any sudden information about issues is better heard by the real brain instead of a clone brain that would have to be released to get to the real body\n\nThat, or it\u2019s just so essential to the plot of \u201cneglectful dad, sad son\u201d that they ignore any logic",

That includes fatigue as well. The huge main reasons this is forbidden are because it can kill you in two ways: lack of chakra, and massive accumulated fatigue. \n\nMultiple times Naruto is touted as having insane amounts of chakra and stamina. Much more than any regular person. This is the only real reason he can use the multi-shadow-clone jutsu like he does \n\nLook into the chakra nature training with kakashi. If I remember correctly, this is when Naruto used this clone shortcut to train himself at a record pace.

Something about the multi shadow clone jutsu relaxes these limits, or lets you issue more simple commands to more clones and still allows them to function, or even act on their own without constant focus. The trade-off, presumably, is the massively increased chakra cost. Naruto lacks the concentration and focus to use standard shadow clones, which is why they immediately fall apart, but can brute force the more powerful technique.",

To add to the fact is that >!he's a reincarnate of Ashura,the only other one being hashirama!< ,whose summons make kyuubi look like a fckin doll.\n\nNaruto,on his own has enough chakra than anyone to have ever been born(remember half of kyuubi's chakra was sealed inside naruto, hours after he was born,while hosts are typically in their early teens during the sealing).\n\nThe only anomaly is gaara but you'd guess shikaku,having the smallest chakra reserves of all could very well be managed,not to mention gaara himself has decent reserves for a kage.",

All memories, battle experience, knowledge, emotions, etc combine back into the original after the jutsu  is released. This includes FATIGUE. So if you make too many clones, not only can the lack of chakra kill you, but the fatigue from all clones combined can also kill you \n\nPart of Naruto\u2019s chakra nature training involved him splitting up into hundreds of clones to practice, resulting in him finishing training at a laughable fraction of the amount of time it would\u2019ve taken a single person. \n\nAs such, Naruto is capable of learning anything he could ever want to learn by splitting himself up and letting clones accumulate the experience as well.

Maybe because he wants his real self to be responsible for the village, or maybe because any sudden information about issues is better heard by the real brain instead of a clone brain that would have to be released to get to the real body\n\nThat, or it\u2019s just so essential to the plot of \u201cneglectful dad, sad son\u201d that they ignore any logic",

American politics is a joke but at least we don't need to rely on another country to protect us from the rest of the world. Your military barely even makes top 50. The karma points are worth enough to let me know that I shouldn't keep feeding you because you're not even a good troll. I play a ton of games, the measure of whether or not a 13 year old plays a game or not doesn't determine how good a game is. \n\nEdit: trans stuff\nI have a bunch of friends that are trans or genderqueer. I love them despite the fact that I think they are delusional and have co occurring mental disorders. I don't care if you think that makes me hateful or \"phobic\" just because I don't agree with your worldview that a person can identify as something they are not. If I were to tell you I identify as black even if my skin is white, and I say you are racist or \"trans-race-phobic\" how would that sit with you",

The trade-off, presumably, is the massively increased chakra cost. Naruto lacks the concentration and focus to use standard shadow clones, which is why they immediately fall apart, but can brute force the more powerful technique.",

They were also hunting him to keep the other jutsus, some of them secret, from being taken by other villages.\n\nEven Guy's/Lee's Eight Gates is a forbidden jutsu. No one in the village arrests Lee or Guy for using it or teaching it. No one says \"that's fucked up, using the 8 gates technique. You're going to Ninja Hell for that!\" They just say \"wow, that's really dangerous if you aren't properly trained and use it incorrectly.\"",

To add to the fact is that >!he's a reincarnate of Ashura,the only other one being hashirama!< ,whose summons make kyuubi look like a fckin doll.\n\nNaruto,on his own has enough chakra than anyone to have ever been born(remember half of kyuubi's chakra was sealed inside naruto, hours after he was born,while hosts are typically in their early teens during the sealing).\n\nThe only anomaly is gaara but you'd guess shikaku,having the smallest chakra reserves of all could very well be managed,not to mention gaara himself has decent reserves for a kage.",

You could argue that he gets little sleep and that\u2019s why he\u2019s so tired\n\nMy assumption is that he has little to no sleep, is already at a certain fatigue limit, therefor only uses clones sparingly to do little things like check up on someone, or do an interview for tv \n\nAs to why he doesn\u2019t let his real body be home with his family while the clone is at the office, I do not know. Maybe because he wants his real self to be responsible for the village, or maybe because any sudden information about issues is better heard by the real brain instead of a clone brain that would have to be released to get to the real body\n\nThat, or it\u2019s just so essential to the plot of \u201cneglectful dad, sad son\u201d that they ignore any logic",

That includes fatigue as well. The huge main reasons this is forbidden are because it can kill you in two ways: lack of chakra, and massive accumulated fatigue. \n\nMultiple times Naruto is touted as having insane amounts of chakra and stamina. Much more than any regular person. This is the only real reason he can use the multi-shadow-clone jutsu like he does \n\nLook into the chakra nature training with kakashi. If I remember correctly, this is when Naruto used this clone shortcut to train himself at a record pace. He split into hundreds of clones and made them all train with him, then he accumulated the experience  (and fatigue) each time he released the jutsu",

I love them despite the fact that I think they are delusional and have co occurring mental disorders. I don't care if you think that makes me hateful or \"phobic\" just because I don't agree with your worldview that a person can identify as something they are not. If I were to tell you I identify as black even if my skin is white, and I say you are racist or \"trans-race-phobic\" how would that sit with you",

To add to the fact is that >!he's a reincarnate of Ashura,the only other one being hashirama!< ,whose summons make kyuubi look like a fckin doll.\n\nNaruto,on his own has enough chakra than anyone to have ever been born(remember half of kyuubi's chakra was sealed inside naruto, hours after he was born,while hosts are typically in their early teens during the sealing).\n\nThe only anomaly is gaara but you'd guess shikaku,having the smallest chakra reserves of all could very well be managed,not to mention gaara himself has decent reserves for a kage.",

Maybe because he wants his real self to be responsible for the village, or maybe because any sudden information about issues is better heard by the real brain instead of a clone brain that would have to be released to get to the real body\n\nThat, or it\u2019s just so essential to the plot of \u201cneglectful dad, sad son\u201d that they ignore any logic",

I love them despite the fact that I think they are delusional and have co occurring mental disorders. I don't care if you think that makes me hateful or \"phobic\" just because I don't agree with your worldview that a person can identify as something they are not. If I were to tell you I identify as black even if my skin is white, and I say you are racist or \"trans-race-phobic\" how would that sit with you",

To add to the fact is that >!he's a reincarnate of Ashura,the only other one being hashirama!< ,whose summons make kyuubi look like a fckin doll.\n\nNaruto,on his own has enough chakra than anyone to have ever been born(remember half of kyuubi's chakra was sealed inside naruto, hours after he was born,while hosts are typically in their early teens during the sealing).\n\nThe only anomaly is gaara but you'd guess shikaku,having the smallest chakra reserves of all could very well be managed,not to mention gaara himself has decent reserves for a kage.",

You could argue that he gets little sleep and that\u2019s why he\u2019s so tired\n\nMy assumption is that he has little to no sleep, is already at a certain fatigue limit, therefor only uses clones sparingly to do little things like check up on someone, or do an interview for tv \n\nAs to why he doesn\u2019t let his real body be home with his family while the clone is at the office, I do not know. Maybe because he wants his real self to be responsible for the village, or maybe because any sudden information about issues is better heard by the real brain instead of a clone brain that would have to be released to get to the real body\n\nThat, or it\u2019s just so essential to the plot of \u201cneglectful dad, sad son\u201d that they ignore any logic",

I love them despite the fact that I think they are delusional and have co occurring mental disorders. I don't care if you think that makes me hateful or \"phobic\" just because I don't agree with your worldview that a person can identify as something they are not. If I were to tell you I identify as black even if my skin is white, and I say you are racist or \"trans-race-phobic\" how would that sit with you",

To add to the fact is that >!he's a reincarnate of Ashura,the only other one being hashirama!< ,whose summons make kyuubi look like a fckin doll.\n\nNaruto,on his own has enough chakra than anyone to have ever been born(remember half of kyuubi's chakra was sealed inside naruto, hours after he was born,while hosts are typically in their early teens during the sealing).\n\nThe only anomaly is gaara but you'd guess shikaku,having the smallest chakra reserves of all could very well be managed,not to mention gaara himself has decent reserves for a kage.",

American politics is a joke but at least we don't need to rely on another country to protect us from the rest of the world. Your military barely even makes top 50. The karma points are worth enough to let me know that I shouldn't keep feeding you because you're not even a good troll. I play a ton of games, the measure of whether or not a 13 year old plays a game or not doesn't determine how good a game is. \n\nEdit: trans stuff\nI have a bunch of friends that are trans or genderqueer. I love them despite the fact that I think they are delusional and have co occurring mental disorders. I don't care if you think that makes me hateful or \"phobic\" just because I don't agree with your worldview that a person can identify as something they are not. If I were to tell you I identify as black even if my skin is white, and I say you are racist or \"trans-race-phobic\" how would that sit with you",

To add to the fact is that >!he's a reincarnate of Ashura,the only other one being hashirama!< ,whose summons make kyuubi look like a fckin doll.\n\nNaruto,on his own has enough chakra than anyone to have ever been born(remember half of kyuubi's chakra was sealed inside naruto, hours after he was born,while hosts are typically in their early teens during the sealing).\n\nThe only anomaly is gaara but you'd guess shikaku,having the smallest chakra reserves of all could very well be managed,not to mention gaara himself has decent reserves for a kage.",

American politics is a joke but at least we don't need to rely on another country to protect us from the rest of the world. Your military barely even makes top 50. The karma points are worth enough to let me know that I shouldn't keep feeding you because you're not even a good troll. I play a ton of games, the measure of whether or not a 13 year old plays a game or not doesn't determine how good a game is. \n\nEdit: trans stuff\nI have a bunch of friends that are trans or genderqueer. I love them despite the fact that I think they are delusional and have co occurring mental disorders. I don't care if you think that makes me hateful or \"phobic\" just because I don't agree with your worldview that a person can identify as something they are not. If I were to tell you I identify as black even if my skin is white, and I say you are racist or \"trans-race-phobic\" how would that sit with you",

American politics is a joke but at least we don't need to rely on another country to protect us from the rest of the world. Your military barely even makes top 50. The karma points are worth enough to let me know that I shouldn't keep feeding you because you're not even a good troll. I play a ton of games, the measure of whether or not a 13 year old plays a game or not doesn't determine how good a game is. \n\nEdit: trans stuff\nI have a bunch of friends that are trans or genderqueer. I love them despite the fact that I think they are delusional and have co occurring mental disorders. I don't care if you think that makes me hateful or \"phobic\" just because I don't agree with your worldview that a person can identify as something they are not. If I were to tell you I identify as black even if my skin is white, and I say you are racist or \"trans-race-phobic\" how would that sit with you",
