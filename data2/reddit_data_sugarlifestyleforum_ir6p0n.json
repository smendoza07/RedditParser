When we got together, she was 19, I was 39. Thing is, I never hit on her. I was riding out the Great Recession in college. We met in a chemistry class and sparred, it was fun. I remember thinking I was going to miss her the last day of class. \n\nThe next fall semester, she came into the math lab where I was tutoring. The only thing I said was \"If you were my friend, you'd stop by every once in while.\" She did, 2-3 times a week, but not just for me, there was a great vibe in that lab. I got to walking her to the bus stop, watching my trains go by while chatting with her until her bus came. \n\nHere's the thing: I wasn't \"grooming\" her because I honestly didn't think I had a chance. She's smart & pretty, so I enjoyed her company, but again, I didn't think I had a chance, until she gave me her # at the end of the semester. \n\nWe had a set expiration date: grad school. I even supported her through a gap year. There is absolutely no doubt that our relationship was a net positive for both of us. We're still friends. Looking back, it is a little cringe for her, but she would absolutely say that it was net positive. \n\nSo, I thought it was funny being called a groomer.

Don't paint me with that brush. \n\nIn fact, I'm just using SA to get my profile pic in front of younger women. My headline is literally \"I'm sweet because of vanilla.\" \n\nYeah yeah, I'm polluting the bowl, but we both know there are plenty of women on SA who either wouldn't make the cut or actually go for a SR. They're the ones I'm trying to appeal to. \n\nYeah yeah, call me delusional, but Dad got a kick out of how many cuties at the park looked my way this morning. I was good looking before I started attending the Iron Church on the regular. \n\nI'll put up a profile review soon, just to make sure that real SB's wouldn't waste more than a second on me. \n\nBut that entitlement driven power dynamic is not something I enjoy. Nor, frankly, is it something I would enjoy. \n\nTo be with me is to be safer than you are in most other circumstances. Never in my life have I struck a woman. I am a protector, not a predator.",

Understand, though, that it's a superpower. I'm not saying it should be, but it is. \n\nI think the hard part is that men often confuse treating women well with being simps. It's actually quite possible to treat women with dignity & respect and still draw bright boundaries around what we will and will not accept/tolerate. \n\n> I believe strongly that the world is made better by one interaction at a time.\n\nIt's all we have, and it seems to have worked this time.

One of the older gals hawking whatever took notice and ordered me to move faster, jokingly. Because I'm a pure Absurdist at heart, I gave her a \"yes, ma'am\" and oh Lordy, did she escalate with her next command. Our discussion was on my mind, and it was hard to not crack up with laughter. \n\n> That\u2019s being dominating ... or \u201ctopping\u201d a scene. I think people think being a Dom is always like a \u201c50 shades\u201d scene but it\u2019s basically the one who controls the scene and assures everyone\u2019s safety.\n\nTIL I'm a dom. No chance I'd advertise myself in those terms, though. I'll let the v-taper do it for me, I guess. \n\nBe well.",

You can hold a conversation. You have done some traveling or hope to. You think deeply. You want to learn about the world and are a planner who wants to pitch ideas, concepts and strategies and love to get feedback. You like to flirt and you love to use your imagination in anything you do. You want to sing \"Seasons of Love\" with me off key at the Omni as we sip wine and eat strawberries. You liked Hamiton but LOVED Waitress. You like to walk on the beach. You want to stand on potato chip rock and survey the view like it is your domain to conquer.

If you\u2019re wired that way, good for you. \u201cTo thine own self be true\u201d.\n\nThe key for me is that posting that you seek an alpha is a data point and serves as a helpful filtering tool.\n\nEverybody\u2019s role here should be to find their match as quickly and efficiently as possible. That means identifying scams and poor matches quickly and putting in the time and effort to find a promising partner.\n\nOther data points: brief, uninspiring prose that details what she doesn\u2019t want and ignores her personality and what she actually seeks? That won\u2019t pique my interest.\n\nAnother data point: The context of the photo matters. For instance, does she post photos with her friends, but makes no attempt to obscure their faces? A potential red flag. Considered bad form by many veterans (and for good reason.)\n\nIt\u2019s all data and, with enough experience, you can get a very good sense of a person through their profile.\n\nI have some narrow geographic and other filters and estimate that for every 100 profiles I read, I reach out to fewer than 5 a most. Perhaps fewer.\n\nIf they claim to be an alpha or claim to seek one, I know to pass. Probably a bad match and waste of both of our time.\n\nThere\u2019s a lid for every pot. Scammers notwithstanding, let the alphas find their pot, and the alphaphiles find their lid. Meanwhile, the rest of us happily search elsewhere.\n\nMay the Filter be with you.",

You are using a highly offensive term, \"groomer,\" which applies to adults attempting to seduce underage children.\n\nI thought it was funny as hell, and upvoted her, until I read this. \n\nI did, in fact, have an age disparate relationship for almost 5 years. When we got together, she was 19, I was 39. Thing is, I never hit on her. I was riding out the Great Recession in college. We met in a chemistry class and sparred, it was fun. I remember thinking I was going to miss her the last day of class. \n\nThe next fall semester, she came into the math lab where I was tutoring. The only thing I said was \"If you were my friend, you'd stop by every once in while.\" She did, 2-3 times a week, but not just for me, there was a great vibe in that lab. I got to walking her to the bus stop, watching my trains go by while chatting with her until her bus came. \n\nHere's the thing: I wasn't \"grooming\" her because I honestly didn't think I had a chance. She's smart & pretty, so I enjoyed her company, but again, I didn't think I had a chance, until she gave me her # at the end of the semester. \n\nWe had a set expiration date: grad school. I even supported her through a gap year. There is absolutely no doubt that our relationship was a net positive for both of us. We're still friends. Looking back, it is a little cringe for her, but she would absolutely say that it was net positive. \n\nSo, I thought it was funny being called a groomer. The idea of me manipulating a younger women's naivety is laughable.",

Don't paint me with that brush. \n\nIn fact, I'm just using SA to get my profile pic in front of younger women. My headline is literally \"I'm sweet because of vanilla.\" \n\nYeah yeah, I'm polluting the bowl, but we both know there are plenty of women on SA who either wouldn't make the cut or actually go for a SR. They're the ones I'm trying to appeal to. \n\nYeah yeah, call me delusional, but Dad got a kick out of how many cuties at the park looked my way this morning. I was good looking before I started attending the Iron Church on the regular. \n\nI'll put up a profile review soon, just to make sure that real SB's wouldn't waste more than a second on me. \n\nBut that entitlement driven power dynamic is not something I enjoy. Nor, frankly, is it something I would enjoy. \n\nTo be with me is to be safer than you are in most other circumstances. Never in my life have I struck a woman. I am a protector, not a predator.",

Understand, though, that it's a superpower. I'm not saying it should be, but it is. \n\nI think the hard part is that men often confuse treating women well with being simps. It's actually quite possible to treat women with dignity & respect and still draw bright boundaries around what we will and will not accept/tolerate. \n\n> I believe strongly that the world is made better by one interaction at a time.\n\nIt's all we have, and it seems to have worked this time.

One of the older gals hawking whatever took notice and ordered me to move faster, jokingly. Because I'm a pure Absurdist at heart, I gave her a \"yes, ma'am\" and oh Lordy, did she escalate with her next command.

If you\u2019re wired that way, good for you. \u201cTo thine own self be true\u201d.\n\nThe key for me is that posting that you seek an alpha is a data point and serves as a helpful filtering tool.\n\nEverybody\u2019s role here should be to find their match as quickly and efficiently as possible. That means identifying scams and poor matches quickly and putting in the time and effort to find a promising partner.\n\nOther data points: brief, uninspiring prose that details what she doesn\u2019t want and ignores her personality and what she actually seeks? That won\u2019t pique my interest.\n\nAnother data point: The context of the photo matters. For instance, does she post photos with her friends, but makes no attempt to obscure their faces? A potential red flag. Considered bad form by many veterans (and for good reason.)\n\nIt\u2019s all data and, with enough experience, you can get a very good sense of a person through their profile.\n\nI have some narrow geographic and other filters and estimate that for every 100 profiles I read, I reach out to fewer than 5 a most. Perhaps fewer.\n\nIf they claim to be an alpha or claim to seek one, I know to pass. Probably a bad match and waste of both of our time.\n\nThere\u2019s a lid for every pot. Scammers notwithstanding, let the alphas find their pot, and the alphaphiles find their lid. Meanwhile, the rest of us happily search elsewhere.\n\nMay the Filter be with you.",

You are using a highly offensive term, \"groomer,\" which applies to adults attempting to seduce underage children.\n\nI thought it was funny as hell, and upvoted her, until I read this. \n\nI did, in fact, have an age disparate relationship for almost 5 years. When we got together, she was 19, I was 39. Thing is, I never hit on her. I was riding out the Great Recession in college. We met in a chemistry class and sparred, it was fun. I remember thinking I was going to miss her the last day of class. \n\nThe next fall semester, she came into the math lab where I was tutoring. The only thing I said was \"If you were my friend, you'd stop by every once in while.\" She did, 2-3 times a week, but not just for me, there was a great vibe in that lab. I got to walking her to the bus stop, watching my trains go by while chatting with her until her bus came. \n\nHere's the thing: I wasn't \"grooming\" her because I honestly didn't think I had a chance. She's smart & pretty, so I enjoyed her company, but again, I didn't think I had a chance, until she gave me her # at the end of the semester. \n\nWe had a set expiration date: grad school. I even supported her through a gap year. There is absolutely no doubt that our relationship was a net positive for both of us. We're still friends. Looking back, it is a little cringe for her, but she would absolutely say that it was net positive. \n\nSo, I thought it was funny being called a groomer. The idea of me manipulating a younger women's naivety is laughable.",

Which isn't about age of consent - but instead manipulation.  It's also not necessarily illegal (despite being extremely immoral and unethetical).\n\nBut again - to loop back, the sheer existence of an age gap does not mean grooming is occurring.",

One of the older gals hawking whatever took notice and ordered me to move faster, jokingly. Because I'm a pure Absurdist at heart, I gave her a \"yes, ma'am\" and oh Lordy, did she escalate with her next command. Our discussion was on my mind, and it was hard to not crack up with laughter. \n\n> That\u2019s being dominating ... or \u201ctopping\u201d a scene.

No chance I'd advertise myself in those terms, though. I'll let the v-taper do it for me, I guess. \n\nBe well.",

If you\u2019re wired that way, good for you. \u201cTo thine own self be true\u201d.\n\nThe key for me is that posting that you seek an alpha is a data point and serves as a helpful filtering tool.\n\nEverybody\u2019s role here should be to find their match as quickly and efficiently as possible. That means identifying scams and poor matches quickly and putting in the time and effort to find a promising partner.\n\nOther data points: brief, uninspiring prose that details what she doesn\u2019t want and ignores her personality and what she actually seeks? That won\u2019t pique my interest.\n\nAnother data point: The context of the photo matters. For instance, does she post photos with her friends, but makes no attempt to obscure their faces? A potential red flag. Considered bad form by many veterans (and for good reason.)\n\nIt\u2019s all data and, with enough experience, you can get a very good sense of a person through their profile.\n\nI have some narrow geographic and other filters and estimate that for every 100 profiles I read, I reach out to fewer than 5 a most. Perhaps fewer.\n\nIf they claim to be an alpha or claim to seek one, I know to pass. Probably a bad match and waste of both of our time.\n\nThere\u2019s a lid for every pot. Scammers notwithstanding, let the alphas find their pot, and the alphaphiles find their lid. Meanwhile, the rest of us happily search elsewhere.\n\nMay the Filter be with you.",

Yes of course\n\nWho is looking for a sugar daddy for his looks? Be honest haha sugar daddies get wealthier As they get older hence the sugar daddy value goes up...I\u2019m 32 and rather go out with a 20yo than a 30yo...plus I find the older the woman the more bad experiences they have had hence they are single so they are on the \u201cI hate men\u201d phase haha",

You are using a highly offensive term, \"groomer,\" which applies to adults attempting to seduce underage children.\n\nI thought it was funny as hell, and upvoted her, until I read this. \n\nI did, in fact, have an age disparate relationship for almost 5 years. When we got together, she was 19, I was 39. Thing is, I never hit on her. I was riding out the Great Recession in college. We met in a chemistry class and sparred, it was fun. I remember thinking I was going to miss her the last day of class. \n\nThe next fall semester, she came into the math lab where I was tutoring. The only thing I said was \"If you were my friend, you'd stop by every once in while.\" She did, 2-3 times a week, but not just for me, there was a great vibe in that lab. I got to walking her to the bus stop, watching my trains go by while chatting with her until her bus came. \n\nHere's the thing: I wasn't \"grooming\" her because I honestly didn't think I had a chance. She's smart & pretty, so I enjoyed her company, but again, I didn't think I had a chance, until she gave me her # at the end of the semester. \n\nWe had a set expiration date: grad school. I even supported her through a gap year. There is absolutely no doubt that our relationship was a net positive for both of us. We're still friends. Looking back, it is a little cringe for her, but she would absolutely say that it was net positive. \n\nSo, I thought it was funny being called a groomer. The idea of me manipulating a younger women's naivety is laughable.",

Don't paint me with that brush. \n\nIn fact, I'm just using SA to get my profile pic in front of younger women. My headline is literally \"I'm sweet because of vanilla.\" \n\nYeah yeah, I'm polluting the bowl, but we both know there are plenty of women on SA who either wouldn't make the cut or actually go for a SR. They're the ones I'm trying to appeal to. \n\nYeah yeah, call me delusional, but Dad got a kick out of how many cuties at the park looked my way this morning. I was good looking before I started attending the Iron Church on the regular. \n\nI'll put up a profile review soon, just to make sure that real SB's wouldn't waste more than a second on me. \n\nBut that entitlement driven power dynamic is not something I enjoy. Nor, frankly, is it something I would enjoy. \n\nTo be with me is to be safer than you are in most other circumstances. Never in my life have I struck a woman. I am a protector, not a predator.",

I'm not saying it should be, but it is. \n\nI think the hard part is that men often confuse treating women well with being simps. It's actually quite possible to treat women with dignity & respect and still draw bright boundaries around what we will and will not accept/tolerate. \n\n> I believe strongly that the world is made better by one interaction at a time.\n\nIt's all we have, and it seems to have worked this time.

If you\u2019re wired that way, good for you. \u201cTo thine own self be true\u201d.\n\nThe key for me is that posting that you seek an alpha is a data point and serves as a helpful filtering tool.\n\nEverybody\u2019s role here should be to find their match as quickly and efficiently as possible. That means identifying scams and poor matches quickly and putting in the time and effort to find a promising partner.\n\nOther data points: brief, uninspiring prose that details what she doesn\u2019t want and ignores her personality and what she actually seeks? That won\u2019t pique my interest.\n\nAnother data point: The context of the photo matters. For instance, does she post photos with her friends, but makes no attempt to obscure their faces? A potential red flag. Considered bad form by many veterans (and for good reason.)\n\nIt\u2019s all data and, with enough experience, you can get a very good sense of a person through their profile.\n\nI have some narrow geographic and other filters and estimate that for every 100 profiles I read, I reach out to fewer than 5 a most. Perhaps fewer.\n\nIf they claim to be an alpha or claim to seek one, I know to pass. Probably a bad match and waste of both of our time.\n\nThere\u2019s a lid for every pot. Scammers notwithstanding, let the alphas find their pot, and the alphaphiles find their lid. Meanwhile, the rest of us happily search elsewhere.\n\nMay the Filter be with you.",

You are using a highly offensive term, \"groomer,\" which applies to adults attempting to seduce underage children.\n\nI thought it was funny as hell, and upvoted her, until I read this. \n\nI did, in fact, have an age disparate relationship for almost 5 years. When we got together, she was 19, I was 39. Thing is, I never hit on her. I was riding out the Great Recession in college. We met in a chemistry class and sparred, it was fun. I remember thinking I was going to miss her the last day of class. \n\nThe next fall semester, she came into the math lab where I was tutoring. The only thing I said was \"If you were my friend, you'd stop by every once in while.\" She did, 2-3 times a week, but not just for me, there was a great vibe in that lab. I got to walking her to the bus stop, watching my trains go by while chatting with her until her bus came. \n\nHere's the thing: I wasn't \"grooming\" her because I honestly didn't think I had a chance. She's smart & pretty, so I enjoyed her company, but again, I didn't think I had a chance, until she gave me her # at the end of the semester. \n\nWe had a set expiration date: grad school. I even supported her through a gap year. There is absolutely no doubt that our relationship was a net positive for both of us. We're still friends. Looking back, it is a little cringe for her, but she would absolutely say that it was net positive. \n\nSo, I thought it was funny being called a groomer. The idea of me manipulating a younger women's naivety is laughable.",

Frankly I avoid talking about those types of SRs - due to the flaming / personal attacks that get generated from them.    \n\nI've had two SRs - with a 19yr old, and 20yr old - who were both very mature and we connected on many levels.  And yes - part of that connection was based on their background/life experiences.  As they did not have an easy life themselves.  \n\nNow, to your other point, the age gap was < 13 years in both cases.  So while I wasn't quite under 30, I wasn't much over it.",

I'm not saying it should be, but it is. \n\nI think the hard part is that men often confuse treating women well with being simps. It's actually quite possible to treat women with dignity & respect and still draw bright boundaries around what we will and will not accept/tolerate. \n\n> I believe strongly that the world is made better by one interaction at a time.\n\nIt's all we have, and it seems to have worked this time.

You are using a highly offensive term, \"groomer,\" which applies to adults attempting to seduce underage children.\n\nI thought it was funny as hell, and upvoted her, until I read this. \n\nI did, in fact, have an age disparate relationship for almost 5 years. When we got together, she was 19, I was 39. Thing is, I never hit on her. I was riding out the Great Recession in college. We met in a chemistry class and sparred, it was fun. I remember thinking I was going to miss her the last day of class. \n\nThe next fall semester, she came into the math lab where I was tutoring. The only thing I said was \"If you were my friend, you'd stop by every once in while.\" She did, 2-3 times a week, but not just for me, there was a great vibe in that lab. I got to walking her to the bus stop, watching my trains go by while chatting with her until her bus came. \n\nHere's the thing: I wasn't \"grooming\" her because I honestly didn't think I had a chance. She's smart & pretty, so I enjoyed her company, but again, I didn't think I had a chance, until she gave me her # at the end of the semester. \n\nWe had a set expiration date: grad school. I even supported her through a gap year. There is absolutely no doubt that our relationship was a net positive for both of us. We're still friends. Looking back, it is a little cringe for her, but she would absolutely say that it was net positive. \n\nSo, I thought it was funny being called a groomer. The idea of me manipulating a younger women's naivety is laughable.",

My headline is literally \"I'm sweet because of vanilla.\" \n\nYeah yeah, I'm polluting the bowl, but we both know there are plenty of women on SA who either wouldn't make the cut or actually go for a SR. They're the ones I'm trying to appeal to. \n\nYeah yeah, call me delusional, but Dad got a kick out of how many cuties at the park looked my way this morning. I was good looking before I started attending the Iron Church on the regular. \n\nI'll put up a profile review soon, just to make sure that real SB's wouldn't waste more than a second on me. \n\nBut that entitlement driven power dynamic is not something I enjoy. Nor, frankly, is it something I would enjoy. \n\nTo be with me is to be safer than you are in most other circumstances. Never in my life have I struck a woman. I am a protector, not a predator.",

I'm not saying it should be, but it is. \n\nI think the hard part is that men often confuse treating women well with being simps. It's actually quite possible to treat women with dignity & respect and still draw bright boundaries around what we will and will not accept/tolerate. \n\n> I believe strongly that the world is made better by one interaction at a time.\n\nIt's all we have, and it seems to have worked this time.

You are using a highly offensive term, \"groomer,\" which applies to adults attempting to seduce underage children.\n\nI thought it was funny as hell, and upvoted her, until I read this. \n\nI did, in fact, have an age disparate relationship for almost 5 years. When we got together, she was 19, I was 39. Thing is, I never hit on her. I was riding out the Great Recession in college. We met in a chemistry class and sparred, it was fun. I remember thinking I was going to miss her the last day of class. \n\nThe next fall semester, she came into the math lab where I was tutoring. The only thing I said was \"If you were my friend, you'd stop by every once in while.\" She did, 2-3 times a week, but not just for me, there was a great vibe in that lab. I got to walking her to the bus stop, watching my trains go by while chatting with her until her bus came. \n\nHere's the thing: I wasn't \"grooming\" her because I honestly didn't think I had a chance. She's smart & pretty, so I enjoyed her company, but again, I didn't think I had a chance, until she gave me her # at the end of the semester. \n\nWe had a set expiration date: grad school. I even supported her through a gap year. There is absolutely no doubt that our relationship was a net positive for both of us. We're still friends. Looking back, it is a little cringe for her, but she would absolutely say that it was net positive. \n\nSo, I thought it was funny being called a groomer. The idea of me manipulating a younger women's naivety is laughable.",

You are using a highly offensive term, \"groomer,\" which applies to adults attempting to seduce underage children.\n\nI thought it was funny as hell, and upvoted her, until I read this. \n\nI did, in fact, have an age disparate relationship for almost 5 years. When we got together, she was 19, I was 39. Thing is, I never hit on her. I was riding out the Great Recession in college. We met in a chemistry class and sparred, it was fun. I remember thinking I was going to miss her the last day of class. \n\nThe next fall semester, she came into the math lab where I was tutoring. The only thing I said was \"If you were my friend, you'd stop by every once in while.\" She did, 2-3 times a week, but not just for me, there was a great vibe in that lab. I got to walking her to the bus stop, watching my trains go by while chatting with her until her bus came. \n\nHere's the thing: I wasn't \"grooming\" her because I honestly didn't think I had a chance. She's smart & pretty, so I enjoyed her company, but again, I didn't think I had a chance, until she gave me her # at the end of the semester. \n\nWe had a set expiration date: grad school. I even supported her through a gap year. There is absolutely no doubt that our relationship was a net positive for both of us. We're still friends. Looking back, it is a little cringe for her, but she would absolutely say that it was net positive. \n\nSo, I thought it was funny being called a groomer. The idea of me manipulating a younger women's naivety is laughable.",
