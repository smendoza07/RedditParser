As for social media, K-pop idols use social media way more than western celebrities. Some vlog almost everyday as their job. \nNot sure why you view social media as negative when you seem to be a pretty active Reddit user.",

HaHa and SeokJin also have their own youtube channels. Running Man also has an official Youtube and Facebook account. Yes American celebrities have people managing their social media, but my point is that social media is hardly a \"Western\" thing. And even if it was, I wouldn't consider it a bad thing. \n\nYeah Jessi's look is more Western, or maybe more South American, but plastic surgery overall is much more prevailent in Korean entertainment industry. It was Jessi's own management in Korea that suggested she get plastic surgery on her face. I don't like any plastic surgery at all, but I would consider double eyelid and skin whitening procedures to be just as toxic as a boob and butt job.",

But the fact that you can't seem to even criticize it is worrisome. I think social media has its uses, but like most tools, the potential for it to do harm has been taken advantage of such as the form of misinformation. The fact that people deny that the Earth is round and that Covid-19 exists is due to the social media echo chambers that people put themselves in. Anyone on reddit saying that there isn't a political sway to this site is an example of that. Not to mention the breach in privacy that social media companies like FB and TikTok do everyday. Don't forget the people who are negatively affected by being on social media too much. Things like cyberbullying and body dismorphia exist and probably still do due to social media. \n\nI don't care whether her management team said she should get plastic surgery. She had a choice. She could have said no. Instead, she said yes to fame and now she looks worse than before the surgeries and for that, I have every right to criticize her. Sorry, I feel that there are better things to watch on TV than her teach people how to get bigger butts",

Instead they send and sponsor free tshirt for RM casts. \n\nAs such,according to korean broadcasting,RM need to tape atleast half of the logo. So people will know what the brand but the brand won't receive full exposure. \n\nIf they want to advertise the brand fully,they will usually have to pay sbs.",

HaHa and SeokJin also have their own youtube channels. Running Man also has an official Youtube and Facebook account. Yes American celebrities have people managing their social media, but my point is that social media is hardly a \"Western\" thing. And even if it was, I wouldn't consider it a bad thing. \n\nYeah Jessi's look is more Western, or maybe more South American, but plastic surgery overall is much more prevailent in Korean entertainment industry. It was Jessi's own management in Korea that suggested she get plastic surgery on her face. I don't like any plastic surgery at all, but I would consider double eyelid and skin whitening procedures to be just as toxic as a boob and butt job.",

But the fact that you can't seem to even criticize it is worrisome. I think social media has its uses, but like most tools, the potential for it to do harm has been taken advantage of such as the form of misinformation. The fact that people deny that the Earth is round and that Covid-19 exists is due to the social media echo chambers that people put themselves in. Anyone on reddit saying that there isn't a political sway to this site is an example of that. Not to mention the breach in privacy that social media companies like FB and TikTok do everyday. Don't forget the people who are negatively affected by being on social media too much. Things like cyberbullying and body dismorphia exist and probably still do due to social media. \n\nI don't care whether her management team said she should get plastic surgery. She had a choice. She could have said no. Instead, she said yes to fame and now she looks worse than before the surgeries and for that, I have every right to criticize her. Sorry, I feel that there are better things to watch on TV than her teach people how to get bigger butts",

Running Man also has an official Youtube and Facebook account. Yes American celebrities have people managing their social media, but my point is that social media is hardly a \"Western\" thing. And even if it was, I wouldn't consider it a bad thing. \n\nYeah Jessi's look is more Western, or maybe more South American, but plastic surgery overall is much more prevailent in Korean entertainment industry. It was Jessi's own management in Korea that suggested she get plastic surgery on her face. I don't like any plastic surgery at all, but I would consider double eyelid and skin whitening procedures to be just as toxic as a boob and butt job.",
