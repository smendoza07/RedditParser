    "body": "Had a date night scheduled for 7:30pm at an upscale restaurant in NYC. I found it kind of weird that the guy didn\u2019t really want to talk much over text, talk on the phone, etc. \n\nI arrived 10 minutes late. Within seconds of stepping out of the car, I am approached by a man who looks nothing like the profile photo of the SD i was supposed to meet. He stopped me outside on the street. He said he is the assistant for Scott. Within 10 seconds, he said, I\u2019m sorry, but you can\u2019t go inside to meet Scott. You won\u2019t meet his expectations. \n\nHorrified, I said how come?\nHe first told me I wasn\u2019t tall enough. My profile on seeking explicitly states that I am 5\u20193\u2019. In real life, I am actually closer to 5\u20194\u2019 but rounded down on seeking. All of my photos on seeking are of me, they are not edited, and all have been taken within the last 2 years or less! I was wearing a long beautiful dress.  (I actually got a compliment on it later on).\n\nBack to the story. At this point, I am angry. I insist that I am going inside to the restaurant. I go and sit by myself at the bar. i text the SD and say \u201cYour assistant just came out and said i'm not tall enough to meet you. That's so disappointing - i'm the same girl in my photos and also I put my height on my profile accurately \ud83d\ude22 \u201c\n\nHe responded: Pics he said is you from 6 years ago.\n\nI said: Not at all. Why don\u2019t you come say hello, I am at the bar. \n\nHe said: Unfortunately he and my lawyer saw you as well and they both agree look nothing like the photos.\n\n\nNow at this point I straight up want to die. I used real, recent photos of me. I proceeded to send the original photos with the time stamps on them from my phone. At this point, I couldn\u2019t feel uglier.\n\nAfter sending my time stamped photos plus one from yesterday, he replied\n\n\u201cHe said in person just not attractive enough unfortunately\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve never been more hurt in my entire life. Feels like any of the self confidence i had is entirely out the window. I ended up eating an appetizer and having 1 drink at the bar alone.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n** UPDATE ** this dirty INCEL has been identified as a known scammer. He invites girls to Buddakan in NYC  and tells them they aren\u2019t attractive enough. It\u2019s the \u201cassistant.\u201d On seeking he disguises his profile with a cute photo of a young guy. The profile text is quite concerning. In retrospect, I don\u2019t know why I would ever even bother meeting someone with a profile like that (see below).\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n** Update #2 ** this guy is still going. Ladies and gentlemen, I\u2019ve gotten a few messages insinuating that perhaps I am a catfish and actually ugly. \n\nI can assure you that I am not a catfish, look exactly like my photos - and that this is a full blown scam. Here are some more messages I received today from the burner number (these are copy and pasted word for word):\n\nIncel: Sorry you feel that way but everyone said you were not attractive. I know it\u2019s hard to hear you\u2019re not pretty. But it\u2019s a fact. If you were it would have gone differently. Your ego is way above what you are.\n\nMe: I don't know who your imaginary lawyers and friends are that you speak of. You were standing outside with your beanie cap in the spring looking nothing like your photos(\ud83e\udd23). I do know that I am absolutely stunning so you can end this now. Your joke is so obvious. Be careful. \n\nIncel: Yes and the imaginary rolls Royce and Bugatti in front of the resteraunt. It\u2019s not for me dumbo. I am an assistant\n\nMe: Never heard of a \"billionaire\" that can't spell Restaurant. Yes, no shit, you are the assistant. Be careful. Move along, bozo\n\n\nI blocked him. Ladies, if you would like me to send you more information on this member please dm me. They are still on seeking and looking for other victims.",

Of course his behavior seems irrational to **you** because you would never do something like this.   He is not like us though.\n\nThis is a guy (the assistant, who was surely the person you were talking to for a week) who has been rejected by women his whole life. He cant change who he is (because he doesn't want to) so he seeks revenge against strangers. Specifically the women who are \"off the market\" because they chase something wildly unattainable to him.  If there were no sugar babies, more women would have to settle for guys like him, and come groveling back.

One time a few years ago, during a particularly rough patch, I was talking to this guy and he was saying I should come to his hotel for a PPM thing, but he said he couldn't get my uber because he only had cash. So I was like, ok you promise you're serious though because this is literally my last $15 in the world and I really can't waste it on an uber for nothing. After some back and forth he was like, I'm sorry I was just going to send you to a random room as a joke but you seem nice so I can't do it to you. It was really eye opening that people do shit like that just for their own entertainment. Please be wary of this. \n\nAlso, as far as his profile is concerned, you really gotta keep in mind \"if it sounds too good to be true, it usually is.\" None of us here are blaming you at all, just pointing things out so you can be smarter for next time.",

Ladies and gentlemen, I\u2019ve gotten a few messages insinuating that perhaps I am a catfish and actually ugly. \n\nI can assure you that I am not a catfish, look exactly like my photos - and that this is a full blown scam. Here are some more messages I received today from the burner number:\n\nIncel: Sorry you feel that way but everyone said you were not attractive. I know it\u2019s hard to hear you\u2019re not pretty. But it\u2019s a fact. If you were it would have gone differently. Your ego is way above what you are.\n\nMe: I don't know who your imaginary lawyers and friends are that you speak of. You were standing outside with your beanie cap in the spring looking nothing like your photos(\ud83e\udd23). I do know that I am absolutely stunning so you can end this now. Your joke is so obvious. Be careful. \n\nIncel: Yes and the imaginary rolls Royce and Bugatti in front of the resteraunt. It\u2019s not for me dumbo. I am an assistant\n\nMe: Never heard of a \"billionaire\" that can't spell Restaurant. Yes, no shit, you are the assistant. Be careful. Move along, bozo\n\n\nI blocked him. Ladies, if you would like me to send you more information on this member please dm me. They are still on seeking and looking for other victims.",

Thus, like most humans who do not like rejecting, he is reacting to it.  Some people will lick there wounded ego and move on.  Some lash out.  Others, perhaps after multiple rejects and even some deep seated history, feel the need to be the rejecter.  Much like **abuse is passed down to the abused which turns into the abuser**, I'm speculating that this is what this guys issue and \"kink\" is.\n\nMy recommendation is to \"man up\" (or woman up) and ask a **big PPM or allowance**.  Then allow him to ask you to **restaurants and reject you without getting your fee-fees hurt** .  If you are really brave, you can even go back to the hotel, get all \"natural state\", and then have him reject you and go home.  What better platonic do you want?  Think of it as a version of S&M or role play.  (joke paragraph here please, I feel for the OP)\n\nLike this **guy is getting \"jollies\" off for free**.  Why not \"beat him at his own game\" and **play along, but for a price.**  Only issue I see, is his getting mad once he figures he has been had.  This guy I'd worry about if he feel cheated in anyway.  Definitely has **woman anger issues**, **caution and self defense lessons** are in order.  If I were an SB, **I would \"Run Forrest Run\"**",

Of course his behavior seems irrational to **you** because you would never do something like this.   He is not like us though.\n\nThis is a guy (the assistant, who was surely the person you were talking to for a week) who has been rejected by women his whole life. He cant change who he is (because he doesn't want to) so he seeks revenge against strangers. Specifically the women who are \"off the market\" because they chase something wildly unattainable to him.  If there were no sugar babies, more women would have to settle for guys like him, and come groveling back. Probably sounds crazy, but head on over to r/news and you will see that the bad guys of this world are in fact \"crazy.\"  They dont follow the love and logic normal people have.",

When taking into account the fact OP is already in a vulnerable and unfamiliar position given she\u2019s a week into this world, so she\u2019s meeting a potential SD without any past references to lean on. So her spidey senses might be ignored or dull because the awkwardness, humiliation and surreal nature of this asshole\u2019s con takes precedence over everything else I\u2019m guessing. Which is likely why this guy has been able to do this numerous times. I think his style of attack is sadly somewhat clever by disarming what (I\u2019m assuming) are very beautiful girls by attacking their looks in a very low key vicious manner, something most of these girls have probably never experienced and flipping the situation so the girls feel at fault.

Of course his behavior seems irrational to **you** because you would never do something like this.   He is not like us though.\n\nThis is a guy (the assistant, who was surely the person you were talking to for a week) who has been rejected by women his whole life.

Specifically the women who are \"off the market\" because they chase something wildly unattainable to him.  If there were no sugar babies, more women would have to settle for guys like him, and come groveling back.

When taking into account the fact OP is already in a vulnerable and unfamiliar position given she\u2019s a week into this world, so she\u2019s meeting a potential SD without any past references to lean on. So her spidey senses might be ignored or dull because the awkwardness, humiliation and surreal nature of this asshole\u2019s con takes precedence over everything else I\u2019m guessing.
