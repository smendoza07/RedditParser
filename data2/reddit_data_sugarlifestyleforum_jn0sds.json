    "body": "It felt so good!!! \n\nOne of my long time online friends posted about how she was struggling with insurance nonsense regarding getting the right formula for her baby girl. So I sent her a message, asked her what formula she needed, and ordered some for her along with some new toys for baby girl and some bath bombs and face masks for mama.\n\nShe was so thankful, and it felt so nice to take some stress off her shoulders.\n\n Before sugaring I was just making ends meet and wouldn't have had extra to help. Thanks to my amazing generous SBF I have more than enough for what I need in a month, and have quite a bit tucked away in savings. I'm so glad I had plenty extra to help my friend out in her time of need \ud83d\udc95",

Not that it\u2019s any of my business what my SB\u2019s do with the money I give them it is rewarding when they can be relatively stress free and generous to their friends and family.   It makes me be more generous rather than them blowing it on expensive clothes or bags or shoes.  That turns me off",

I have a little(adopted) brother in the DR & I recently sent him the $100 I received from my very 1st M&G. It felt good but I'm sure it's not enough, he had heart surgery here in the States but then was sent back home but needs more care... We do what we can... We need more selfless people in this world...*<3 Thank You for sharing! <3",
