    "body": "I\u2019m a 21 year old college student. This is the exact group emerging from TikTok and taking over SA and the bowl. I\u2019m not sure how many of you are familiar with these videos, I know we\u2019ve all seen/heard of them, but I\u2019m getting them on my FYP every single day. \u201cNever do M&Gs, say you will after sending money\u201d \u201cIf he wants to talk on the phone say it\u2019s an \u2018extra charge\u2019 :)\u201d \u201cI made $xxxxx in one week from being an online SB!\u201d I can\u2019t help myself from getting bitter and annoyed. Do girls really think that men are so desperate and lonely that they\u2019ll pay for a phone call??? It\u2019s just ridiculous to see these fake perceptions of the bowl and the woman who think it\u2019s a quick side hustle. Saw a TikTok of a girl who got taken out to dinner with her friend by a SD and he paid for the $xxx meal and in addition gave her $xxx afterwards. Just for the M&G. The entire comment section is flooded with \u201cthat\u2019s it???\u201d . That\u2019s more than I\u2019ve ever been offered for a M&G, and frankly probably more than any of us have. Now I have all this fake competition and am being weened out of the bowl because I fit the stereotype. Ugh. Just needed to rant cause I know most of y\u2019all feel the same",

Now picture every corner with a restaurant... if they\u2019re all fast food joints it would still be beneficial to open a $$$$ restaurant because there is market opportunity for that particular type of establishment, quality, and ambiance. \n\nI\u2019m in some of the highest saturated cities and have absolutely no issue finding very lucrative arrangements with SDs despite the fact that I\u2019m 30+ and have kids. Being educated, classy, sincere, and emotionally intelligent makes it easy to stand out from the 20-something girls with attitudes who don\u2019t offer much emotional or intellectual value to an SD.",

But if they did no advertising (no lying), they would go out of business. Some fraction of tiktok girls become real SBs, and they would not be sugar babies at all, except for the fact that advertising lied to them, to get them to try it out.  Without sbs, there would be no site at all to match sbs and sds.\n#\nI hope tiktok girls learn the broader lesson about sales, but its irrelevant. Sugar babies wont find their way to seeking without the usual amount of fraud involved in every advertisement you see.",

I know another guy who spends 10k a month on online games here & there.  There's girls getting xxxx to dine, drink, & gamble in vegas.

No longer paid m&g  I will flip them something if they act with class and courtesy, show up near on time, not a slob and match their pics .  So tired of what ends up pics from two  years ago ago and two dress sizes and the claim of slim was true two years ago.  \n\nSo act with class and empathy and ye shall be rewarded, act like a scammed and you can make it work for a while.  But it ends.\n\nI actually have flipped a gift card to well put together scam just because I was entertained and the really put the effort in .....they went for more of course and I was honest hey it a scam as I called your employer looking for you a long time ago, they never hear of you and there are no women in that department, lol they tried to be offended I laughed I said hey I was entertained and paid for that value but im not sending anymore.  They were not happy but hey we can meet anytime.\n\nBut yes the scam request have come out of the wood work and it hurts thr real thing but you will stand out and you end uo getting a lot more plus an actual relationship that may add more benefits than what you thought in beginning.\n\nJust recognize the routine quick for SDs money for nothing and kicks for free dont work, don't reward anyone anymore until they prove themselves.

Even if he found out he wouldn't care cause he also gave a (male) friend xxx to get lap dances from girls & throw money around all the time.  I know another guy who spends 10k a month on online games here & there.  There's girls getting xxxx to dine, drink, & gamble in vegas.  Don't think paying for dinner is loser mentality compared to paying for sex.  You are paying for services & a person's time regardless so it's just a choice of what you find as something you can afford.",

I didn\u2019t even have sex with my last SD (it wasn\u2019t what he was looking for, and I was fine with that; we were intimate but not sexual). \n\nRegardless, that has nothing to do with what I said, which involved the fact that girls calling selling sexual content online/sexting/camming/whatever else sugaring. It isn\u2019t. In some cases, sugaring can be SW, but not all SW is sugaring, and calling other forms of SW sugaring harms the community as a whole.",
