Such a system that forces sons to kill their parents and siblings to kill siblings for \"the reason of the state\" is an unjust system that should be torn down.\n\nIf I were Itachi I'd focus on unlocking the Mangekyo Sharingan, and then exchange eyes with Shisui. From there I'd kill Danzo and then publicly expose the plans by the village government to murder the Uchiha clan. It would cause a political uproar as if the village could so easily massacre one clan, there's nothing stopping from doing the same to the Nara Clan, the Hyuga Clan, the Yamanaka Clan, etc.",

But in an era of constant warfare, the most common thing to trigger this would be the feelings of sorrow after seeing your family and comrades die on the battlefield.\n\n> In all seriousness though, fuck Danzo and Tobirama, if I was Uchiha I wouldn't be into the will of fire either.\n\nI remember watching the Hashirama fight and then he started saying that he'd be down to kill his own child or his brothers if they threatened the village.\n\nEven Madara was shocked that Hashirama would actually stab him from the back which showed that he actually trusted him. Madara was quite broken by the constant wars, and thought the Infinite Tsukiyomi was sent as a solution by the Sage of Six Paths. From his POV, it was almost like finding a solution from God (Hagaromo was seen as a living god by everyone).\n\nThat shit with Hashirama got dark really fast. And despite my misgivings about the Boruto series, one thing I appreciate about Naruto in it is that he's not going to entertain the possibility of murdering his own son.",

But in an era of constant warfare, the most common thing to trigger this would be the feelings of sorrow after seeing your family and comrades die on the battlefield.\n\n> In all seriousness though, fuck Danzo and Tobirama, if I was Uchiha I wouldn't be into the will of fire either.\n\nI remember watching the Hashirama fight and then he started saying that he'd be down to kill his own child or his brothers if they threatened the village.\n\nEven Madara was shocked that Hashirama would actually stab him from the back which showed that he actually trusted him. Madara was quite broken by the constant wars, and thought the Infinite Tsukiyomi was sent as a solution by the Sage of Six Paths. From his POV, it was almost like finding a solution from God (Hagaromo was seen as a living god by everyone).\n\nThat shit with Hashirama got dark really fast. And despite my misgivings about the Boruto series, one thing I appreciate about Naruto in it is that he's not going to entertain the possibility of murdering his own son.",

From there I'd kill Danzo and then publicly expose the plans by the village government to murder the Uchiha clan.

Madara was quite broken by the constant wars, and thought the Infinite Tsukiyomi was sent as a solution by the Sage of Six Paths. From his POV, it was almost like finding a solution from God (Hagaromo was seen as a living god by everyone).\n\nThat shit with Hashirama got dark really fast. And despite my misgivings about the Boruto series, one thing I appreciate about Naruto in it is that he's not going to entertain the possibility of murdering his own son.",

Madara was quite broken by the constant wars, and thought the Infinite Tsukiyomi was sent as a solution by the Sage of Six Paths. From his POV, it was almost like finding a solution from God (Hagaromo was seen as a living god by everyone).\n\nThat shit with Hashirama got dark really fast.

Madara was quite broken by the constant wars, and thought the Infinite Tsukiyomi was sent as a solution by the Sage of Six Paths. From his POV, it was almost like finding a solution from God (Hagaromo was seen as a living god by everyone).\n\nThat shit with Hashirama got dark really fast. And despite my misgivings about the Boruto series, one thing I appreciate about Naruto in it is that he's not going to entertain the possibility of murdering his own son.",

But in an era of constant warfare, the most common thing to trigger this would be the feelings of sorrow after seeing your family and comrades die on the battlefield.\n\n> In all seriousness though, fuck Danzo and Tobirama, if I was Uchiha I wouldn't be into the will of fire either.\n\nI remember watching the Hashirama fight and then he started saying that he'd be down to kill his own child or his brothers if they threatened the village.\n\nEven Madara was shocked that Hashirama would actually stab him from the back which showed that he actually trusted him. Madara was quite broken by the constant wars, and thought the Infinite Tsukiyomi was sent as a solution by the Sage of Six Paths. From his POV, it was almost like finding a solution from God (Hagaromo was seen as a living god by everyone).\n\nThat shit with Hashirama got dark really fast. And despite my misgivings about the Boruto series, one thing I appreciate about Naruto in it is that he's not going to entertain the possibility of murdering his own son.",

It doesn\u2019t paralyze people just traps them in their mind and or makes them think they\u2019re moving when they aren\u2019t, anxiety isn\u2019t a physical effect that\u2019s mental, they aren\u2019t blind their brains just aren\u2019t being allowed to process what their eyes are seeing. None of that is physical it\u2019s all inside people\u2019s heads. Just like the \u201cillusory orgasm\u201d you listed would just be inside someone\u2019s head. A physical orgasm has specific effects on an individuals physiology, it causes the release of specific hormones, in men it causes ejaculation, it causes the bodies muscles to clench and then relax, and a multitude of other physical effects. We never see Genjutsu be able to do anything like that.",

It\u2019s been done to rats, monkeys, hamsters, pigs, cats, and dogs. It really is that simple, I don\u2019t see how you could get any more direct than electrical stimulation.",

It\u2019s literally the least explored branch of techniques in naruto, and outside of the Uchiha\u2019s ridiculously overpowered techniques we hardly ever even see it get used. Could something like that be done with Genjutsu, possibly. But we never see Genjutsu have an actual physical effect on anyone.",

Genjutsu makes people fall asleep, paralyzes people, have anxiety, go blind, etc. Aren't those physical effects? It being one of the least explored parts of Naruto explains why you didn't think about it, but it literally means illusion techniques. You could almost certainly just give someone an illusory orgasm not related to or limited by neurology.",

None of that is physical it\u2019s all inside people\u2019s heads. Just like the \u201cillusory orgasm\u201d you listed would just be inside someone\u2019s head. A physical orgasm has specific effects on an individuals physiology, it causes the release of specific hormones, in men it causes ejaculation, it causes the bodies muscles to clench and then relax, and a multitude of other physical effects.

It\u2019s been done to rats, monkeys, hamsters, pigs, cats, and dogs. It really is that simple, I don\u2019t see how you could get any more direct than electrical stimulation.",
