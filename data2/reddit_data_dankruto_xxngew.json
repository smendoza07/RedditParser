With the Rinnegan and EMS he is far superior.\n\nSecond of all, Genjutsu doesn't require a lot of chakra, and even if it did Sasuke has a lot of chakra to waste. \n\nHe didn't attempt it because of plot. His Rinnegan Genjutsu should be able work on Naruto easily. But obviously Naruto was destined to win and it would be boring if Genjutsu was only used. Also they probably didn't want Naruto to fight with his eyes closed the entire fight lol.",

Summon ducking manda and put him in a genjutsu.\n\n0 proof he was out of chakra, Deidara's incorrect statements are not proof, he has no way of knowing the chakra level of his opponents, he has no dojutsu nor is he a sensor, he didn't even summon a hawk during this fight wtf are you talking about? Complaining about elemental advantages now? Is it fair that Naruto's wind beats Sasuke's lightning? Deidara was lucky Sasuke wasn't even trying to kill him or it would be over quicker. \n\n> Fails to beat a crippled dying Itachi, Itachi has to let him win\n\nYh Kishi can't let his fav character actually lose a battle, but Sasuke had a regular sharingan at least, Itachi survived Kirin due to the mangekyou, he admits that himself. \n\n> Should have died multiple times vs bee.\n\nYh well Bee should have died vs Kisame, we all have our plot armour moments\n\n> Sakura poisoned Naruto, keeping them from fighting.\n\nNo, Obito was going to take Sasuke away regardless, they weren't going to fight that instant, especially with Sasuke exhausted and nearly blind. \n\nAmazing bias, let me guess, you think Naruto has no plot armour?",

Jiraiya, Orochimaru, fucking Hashirama couldn\u2019t get Kurama to cooperate the way Naruto did. Madara could use force to make Kurama do what he wanted temporarily, but only Naruto was capable of earning his respect and getting his power consensually.\n\nThe nine-tails is a cheat code, but you already have to be GOATED to learn it",

Naruto also had to train to eb able to use Kurama's chakra without losing control and Kurama was purposely giving Naruto chakra when he was angry so he could either break free of Naruto's body or just take over it. One rinnegan that can: control gravity, open dimensional portals, let Sasuke teleport, remove souls, create mechanical body parts, absorb chakra, amps physical stats, infinitely heal oneself. But nah, thats not that big of a power up. Also y rnt u using the same argument for Sasuke as Naruto. U said that Kakashi taught Sasuke the chidori because u need a sharingan but Naruto learning sage mode due to his large chakra is chalked up to Kurama and genetics. Be fair in ur arguments bro",

Obito completely mind controlled Yagura who was a perfect Jinchuriki. This means that Sasuke at that point didn't have potent enough Genjutsu to beat Bee. With the Rinnegan and EMS he is far superior.\n\nSecond of all, Genjutsu doesn't require a lot of chakra, and even if it did Sasuke has a lot of chakra to waste. \n\nHe didn't attempt it because of plot. His Rinnegan Genjutsu should be able work on Naruto easily. But obviously Naruto was destined to win and it would be boring if Genjutsu was only used.

The power of the technique depends on the amount of chakra used. Whether Naruto is jumping up or down the rasengan is as strong as Naruto makes it.\n\nIf I jump down and try to punch you and you jump up to hit me who's attack is going to be stronger sure they're magical attacks but physics still work the same if Naruto has to push his Rasengan into Sasukes Chidori tbh if you don't understand this you can't understand the rest of my arguments lmao\n\nSure it's not a whole lot but it's there look up Naruto and Sasuke undo Tsukuyomi \n\n\n>Because of the amount of chakra not chakra itself being stronger.\n\nIt's stated that Kuramas chakra is so potent it's like a poison to other people it's definitely more potent than regular chakra secondly Sasuke would've absorbed a similar amount as the chakra looked the same when he had it on him vs absorbing it it still definitely amped Sasuke's attack while Naruto's wasn't amped at all\n\n>That is just wrong. Rasengan is change in chakra form and chidori is change in chakra nature.\n\nHow so? Rasengan is the ultimate change in chakra form Kakashi couldn't add lightning to it and it created a different jutsu instead so if anything it makes sense that Rasengan is stronger than Chidori as it isn't on the same level of form change",

Summon ducking manda and put him in a genjutsu.\n\n0 proof he was out of chakra, Deidara's incorrect statements are not proof, he has no way of knowing the chakra level of his opponents, he has no dojutsu nor is he a sensor, he didn't even summon a hawk during this fight wtf are you talking about? Complaining about elemental advantages now? Is it fair that Naruto's wind beats Sasuke's lightning? Deidara was lucky Sasuke wasn't even trying to kill him or it would be over quicker. \n\n> Fails to beat a crippled dying Itachi, Itachi has to let him win\n\nYh Kishi can't let his fav character actually lose a battle, but Sasuke had a regular sharingan at least, Itachi survived Kirin due to the mangekyou, he admits that himself. \n\n> Should have died multiple times vs bee.\n\nYh well Bee should have died vs Kisame, we all have our plot armour moments\n\n> Sakura poisoned Naruto, keeping them from fighting.\n\nNo, Obito was going to take Sasuke away regardless, they weren't going to fight that instant, especially with Sasuke exhausted and nearly blind. \n\nAmazing bias, let me guess, you think Naruto has no plot armour?",

Obito completely mind controlled Yagura who was a perfect Jinchuriki. This means that Sasuke at that point didn't have potent enough Genjutsu to beat Bee. With the Rinnegan and EMS he is far superior.\n\nSecond of all, Genjutsu doesn't require a lot of chakra, and even if it did Sasuke has a lot of chakra to waste. \n\nHe didn't attempt it because of plot. His Rinnegan Genjutsu should be able work on Naruto easily. But obviously Naruto was destined to win and it would be boring if Genjutsu was only used. Also they probably didn't want Naruto to fight with his eyes closed the entire fight lol.",

Rasengan is change in chakra form and chidori is change in chakra nature.\n\nHow so? Rasengan is the ultimate change in chakra form Kakashi couldn't add lightning to it and it created a different jutsu instead so if anything it makes sense that Rasengan is stronger than Chidori as it isn't on the same level of form change",

Sasuke absorbed chakra from Naruto,  they used the same chakra, how is Sasuke attack any more amped than Naruto.\n\n>How so? Rasengan is the ultimate change in chakra form Kakashi couldn't add lightning to it and it created a different jutsu instead so if anything it makes sense that Rasengan is stronger than Chidori as it isn't on the same level of form change\n\nIn your previos comment you said \"*Chidori is just a failed attempt at a lightning style Rasengan\"* and it was wrong, you corected yourself.",

He was just not as good when he fought Bee.\n\n>And Bee was flat out convinced that no Genjutsu worked on Jinchuriki and Sasuke doesn't have the Chakra to waste on moves that wouldn't work I'm sure he thought the same and he had a pretty solid idea of what does or doesn't work on Naruto or I'm sure he would've tried the Genjutsu but homie didn't even attempt to do it to Naruto\r  \n\r\n\nFirst of all, Genjutsu has worked on Perfect Genjutsu before. Obito completely mind controlled Yagura who was a perfect Jinchuriki. This means that Sasuke at that point didn't have potent enough Genjutsu to beat Bee. With the Rinnegan and EMS he is far superior.\n\nSecond of all, Genjutsu doesn't require a lot of chakra, and even if it did Sasuke has a lot of chakra to waste. \n\nHe didn't attempt it because of plot. His Rinnegan Genjutsu should be able work on Naruto easily. But obviously Naruto was destined to win and it would be boring if Genjutsu was only used. Also they probably didn't want Naruto to fight with his eyes closed the entire fight lol.",

Sasuke absorbed chakra from Naruto,  they used the same chakra, how is Sasuke attack any more amped than Naruto.\n\n>How so? Rasengan is the ultimate change in chakra form Kakashi couldn't add lightning to it and it created a different jutsu instead so if anything it makes sense that Rasengan is stronger than Chidori as it isn't on the same level of form change\n\nIn your previos comment you said \"*Chidori is just a failed attempt at a lightning style Rasengan\"* and it was wrong, you corected yourself.",

He was just not as good when he fought Bee.\n\n>And Bee was flat out convinced that no Genjutsu worked on Jinchuriki and Sasuke doesn't have the Chakra to waste on moves that wouldn't work I'm sure he thought the same and he had a pretty solid idea of what does or doesn't work on Naruto or I'm sure he would've tried the Genjutsu but homie didn't even attempt to do it to Naruto\r  \n\r\n\nFirst of all, Genjutsu has worked on Perfect Genjutsu before. Obito completely mind controlled Yagura who was a perfect Jinchuriki. This means that Sasuke at that point didn't have potent enough Genjutsu to beat Bee. With the Rinnegan and EMS he is far superior.\n\nSecond of all, Genjutsu doesn't require a lot of chakra, and even if it did Sasuke has a lot of chakra to waste. \n\nHe didn't attempt it because of plot. His Rinnegan Genjutsu should be able work on Naruto easily. But obviously Naruto was destined to win and it would be boring if Genjutsu was only used. Also they probably didn't want Naruto to fight with his eyes closed the entire fight lol.",

He was just not as good when he fought Bee.\n\n>And Bee was flat out convinced that no Genjutsu worked on Jinchuriki and Sasuke doesn't have the Chakra to waste on moves that wouldn't work I'm sure he thought the same and he had a pretty solid idea of what does or doesn't work on Naruto or I'm sure he would've tried the Genjutsu but homie didn't even attempt to do it to Naruto\r  \n\r\n\nFirst of all, Genjutsu has worked on Perfect Genjutsu before. Obito completely mind controlled Yagura who was a perfect Jinchuriki. This means that Sasuke at that point didn't have potent enough Genjutsu to beat Bee. With the Rinnegan and EMS he is far superior.\n\nSecond of all, Genjutsu doesn't require a lot of chakra, and even if it did Sasuke has a lot of chakra to waste. \n\nHe didn't attempt it because of plot. His Rinnegan Genjutsu should be able work on Naruto easily. But obviously Naruto was destined to win and it would be boring if Genjutsu was only used. Also they probably didn't want Naruto to fight with his eyes closed the entire fight lol.",

I don't see how adding flames to lightning attack makes it any stronger.",

Obito completely mind controlled Yagura who was a perfect Jinchuriki. This means that Sasuke at that point didn't have potent enough Genjutsu to beat Bee. With the Rinnegan and EMS he is far superior.\n\nSecond of all, Genjutsu doesn't require a lot of chakra, and even if it did Sasuke has a lot of chakra to waste. \n\nHe didn't attempt it because of plot. His Rinnegan Genjutsu should be able work on Naruto easily. But obviously Naruto was destined to win and it would be boring if Genjutsu was only used. Also they probably didn't want Naruto to fight with his eyes closed the entire fight lol.",

I don't see how adding flames to lightning attack makes it any stronger.",

Obito completely mind controlled Yagura who was a perfect Jinchuriki. This means that Sasuke at that point didn't have potent enough Genjutsu to beat Bee. With the Rinnegan and EMS he is far superior.\n\nSecond of all, Genjutsu doesn't require a lot of chakra, and even if it did Sasuke has a lot of chakra to waste. \n\nHe didn't attempt it because of plot. His Rinnegan Genjutsu should be able work on Naruto easily. But obviously Naruto was destined to win and it would be boring if Genjutsu was only used. Also they probably didn't want Naruto to fight with his eyes closed the entire fight lol.",

The power of the technique depends on the amount of chakra used. Whether Naruto is jumping up or down the rasengan is as strong as Naruto makes it.\n\nIf I jump down and try to punch you and you jump up to hit me who's attack is going to be stronger sure they're magical attacks but physics still work the same if Naruto has to push his Rasengan into Sasukes Chidori tbh if you don't understand this you can't understand the rest of my arguments lmao\n\nSure it's not a whole lot but it's there look up Naruto and Sasuke undo Tsukuyomi \n\n\n>Because of the amount of chakra not chakra itself being stronger.\n\nIt's stated that Kuramas chakra is so potent it's like a poison to other people it's definitely more potent than regular chakra secondly Sasuke would've absorbed a similar amount as the chakra looked the same when he had it on him vs absorbing it it still definitely amped Sasuke's attack while Naruto's wasn't amped at all\n\n>That is just wrong.

Obito completely mind controlled Yagura who was a perfect Jinchuriki. This means that Sasuke at that point didn't have potent enough Genjutsu to beat Bee. With the Rinnegan and EMS he is far superior.\n\nSecond of all, Genjutsu doesn't require a lot of chakra, and even if it did Sasuke has a lot of chakra to waste. \n\nHe didn't attempt it because of plot. His Rinnegan Genjutsu should be able work on Naruto easily. But obviously Naruto was destined to win and it would be boring if Genjutsu was only used. Also they probably didn't want Naruto to fight with his eyes closed the entire fight lol.",

Obito completely mind controlled Yagura who was a perfect Jinchuriki. This means that Sasuke at that point didn't have potent enough Genjutsu to beat Bee. With the Rinnegan and EMS he is far superior.\n\nSecond of all, Genjutsu doesn't require a lot of chakra, and even if it did Sasuke has a lot of chakra to waste. \n\nHe didn't attempt it because of plot. His Rinnegan Genjutsu should be able work on Naruto easily. But obviously Naruto was destined to win and it would be boring if Genjutsu was only used. Also they probably didn't want Naruto to fight with his eyes closed the entire fight lol.",

He was just not as good when he fought Bee.\n\n>And Bee was flat out convinced that no Genjutsu worked on Jinchuriki and Sasuke doesn't have the Chakra to waste on moves that wouldn't work I'm sure he thought the same and he had a pretty solid idea of what does or doesn't work on Naruto or I'm sure he would've tried the Genjutsu but homie didn't even attempt to do it to Naruto\r  \n\r\n\nFirst of all, Genjutsu has worked on Perfect Genjutsu before. Obito completely mind controlled Yagura who was a perfect Jinchuriki. This means that Sasuke at that point didn't have potent enough Genjutsu to beat Bee. With the Rinnegan and EMS he is far superior.\n\nSecond of all, Genjutsu doesn't require a lot of chakra, and even if it did Sasuke has a lot of chakra to waste. \n\nHe didn't attempt it because of plot. His Rinnegan Genjutsu should be able work on Naruto easily. But obviously Naruto was destined to win and it would be boring if Genjutsu was only used. Also they probably didn't want Naruto to fight with his eyes closed the entire fight lol.",
