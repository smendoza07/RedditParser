It was never lethal, it was always as strong as the story required, it almost never drew large amounts of blood, it didn't leave people with burns or lost limbs, and the user was forced to meet opponents head on. \n\nThis meant Naruto had a tool that was perfect for a moralizing protagonist. \n\nHe demonstrates bravery since he can't just stay in the shadows and win through genjutsu. \n\nHe doesn't have to kill his opponents or bear responsibility for maiming them (Kakuzu and white zetsu excepted, except Kakashi stole the kill for Kakuzu and white zetsu seemingly don't bleed or feel pain). \n\nAnd his jutsu is so variable in its effect on targets that it can succeed or fail to do something without people complaining about inconsistency. If the Raikiri somehow failed to pierce a target, we'd want to know how the target survived. But if a rasengan just knocks the wind out of someone, we don't seem to question how the same jutsu that blew up a water tower didn't explode the target's organs.",

You're right to point out it wasn't used to kill many, if any characters. But this more has to do with the writing around Naruto's character than the lethality of the Rasenshuriken.\n\n>It mortally wounds one non-zetsu living person, Kakuzu, and that person is left alive long enough for Kakashi to steal the kill.\n\nPersonally, I don't have a lot of issues with the writing in Naruto (a lot of people will disagree with me on this but that's them) but this is one of my biggest ones. There is no way Kakuzu should have still been alive at all after getting hit with the Rasenshuriken. Yes, technically it killed him like four or five times over but he still had enough life left afterwards that Musashi Kishimoto could conveniently have someone other than Naruto kill him the final time. But we know that's bullshit from Tsunade's explanation of the Rasenshuriken. He should have been killed at least thousands of times over due to the extreme level of thoroughness with which the Rasenshuriken shreds things. It shreds so thoroughly that even all the individual molecules get shredded as well. There's no way that Kakuzu should have only died four or five times from that.\n\n>The move is powerful, sure.

I forgot just how many different one-hit kill moves there is in Naruto. For some reason I was only thinking of Amaterasu and Rasenshuriken (probably because those are the two one-hit kill moves used by Sasuke and Naruto). Rasenshuriken is still definitely a one-hit kill move that normal characters should not be capable of surviving, but there's definitely a lot of other one-hit kill moves that are equal to or greater than Rasenshuriken in their lethality.",

It's got power and, eventually, adaptability with all the element combinations Naruto learned from the tailed beasts. It also scales up decently well, able to cut through a god tree pretty easily (once boosted by war arc amps). But it doesn't do anything that particle style can't do, it can't seal or trap unkillable enemies like Gaara's sand or Sai's paint or Obito/Kakashi's kamui, and its one-shot power against humans isn't top tier (though it's still high tier, especially at series end). \n\nOne thing I'll definitely grant to rasenshuriken is ease of use once mastered. There are several other supposedly awesome abilities that kinda suck from a practical aspect. Three of the Sage's tools, for example, only work when used together and are stupidly complex. Plus if you can bop someone with the rope tool you could just as easily cut them with a sword or other weapon, skipping all the word-game nonsense. Several of the Ninja Swords of the Mist are similarly underwhelming, like Helmet Splitter or the Executioner Sword, both of which offer minor advantages in exchange for being cumbersome. Hidan's ritual requires tons of setup. Truth Seeker Orbs are strong but nowhere near as strong as they are implied to be, and you need to go through tons of steps to unlock them. Half of Pain's abilities also seem overly complex or of little value in a fight, like the Asura Path (basically just a pointy guy with fancy paper bombs), Human Path (can't do anything without grabbing your head first), and Animal Path (doesn't do shit after the animals are summoned). \n\nAnd plenty of other one-shot abilities are locked behind special eyeballs or genetics, sometimes with soft caps on how much they can be used (soft caps because you can get around MS caps by unlocking EMS). Rasenshuriken can theoretically be learned by anyone with enough practice, patience, and chakra. So even though Naruto still gets hax power-ups because of his bloodline, he still has an \"everyman\" jutsu that he earned rather than one he unlocked through birth.",

You sure about that?\ud83d\uddff\n\nBecause I don\u2019t ever remember Kakashi using his arsenal of over 1000 Jutsus aside from [Chidori/Raikiri\u2192Some varient of that sh-t/Mud wall/Great fireball(that one wasn\u2019t even in a serious fight, it was against his student on 2nd bell test/Water dragon(also against his student)].\n\nOr ever using his Sharingan to copy Jutsus which he did only once at the start of the series. Maybe some more like 2 or 3 that I forget, because they weren\u2019t impactful enough. Like they call him \"Copy Ninja Hatake Kakashi of the Sharingan\", they keep rubbing it on our face but they nearly never show sh-t to prove their point.\n\nOr even knowing about his family like his dad, talking about some big let down. We only know his name and that he was as strong as the Three Legendary Sanin. And no, we\u2019re not gonna talk about his mom.\n\nI don\u2019t remember Kakashi winning that much of fight alone like Naruto or Sasuke.\n\nI don\u2019t think they were fair with him either. They didn\u2019t explore his full potential either, surely not as much as someone like Sai but they *cleary* could have done better with Kakashi.\n\nSo it\u2019s more like:\n\n\"Story of every character that isn\u2019t Naruto or Sasuke\"\n\nBecause Naruto and Sasuke were the real focus until the very end. Practically everything revolves around Naruto and Sasuke. It\u2019s always Naruto and Sasuke. Like them being some little Jesus Ninjas. Do you remember Kakashi being some little Jesus Ninja? Because I surely don\u2019t.\n\nOFC I get that they are the MCs so that\u2019s normal, but still, it doesn\u2019t feel right. They did all of Naruto\u2019s side characters so dirty. **All of them.**\n\n\n*Literally.*",

It was never lethal, it was always as strong as the story required, it almost never drew large amounts of blood, it didn't leave people with burns or lost limbs, and the user was forced to meet opponents head on. \n\nThis meant Naruto had a tool that was perfect for a moralizing protagonist. \n\nHe demonstrates bravery since he can't just stay in the shadows and win through genjutsu. \n\nHe doesn't have to kill his opponents or bear responsibility for maiming them (Kakuzu and white zetsu excepted, except Kakashi stole the kill for Kakuzu and white zetsu seemingly don't bleed or feel pain). \n\nAnd his jutsu is so variable in its effect on targets that it can succeed or fail to do something without people complaining about inconsistency. If the Raikiri somehow failed to pierce a target, we'd want to know how the target survived. But if a rasengan just knocks the wind out of someone, we don't seem to question how the same jutsu that blew up a water tower didn't explode the target's organs.",

You're right to point out it wasn't used to kill many, if any characters. But this more has to do with the writing around Naruto's character than the lethality of the Rasenshuriken.\n\n>It mortally wounds one non-zetsu living person, Kakuzu, and that person is left alive long enough for Kakashi to steal the kill.\n\nPersonally, I don't have a lot of issues with the writing in Naruto (a lot of people will disagree with me on this but that's them) but this is one of my biggest ones. There is no way Kakuzu should have still been alive at all after getting hit with the Rasenshuriken. Yes, technically it killed him like four or five times over but he still had enough life left afterwards that Musashi Kishimoto could conveniently have someone other than Naruto kill him the final time. But we know that's bullshit from Tsunade's explanation of the Rasenshuriken. He should have been killed at least thousands of times over due to the extreme level of thoroughness with which the Rasenshuriken shreds things. It shreds so thoroughly that even all the individual molecules get shredded as well. There's no way that Kakuzu should have only died four or five times from that.\n\n>The move is powerful, sure.

And there are abilities like the water bullet that will punch right through a person unless blocked with a strong enough technique.\n\nThis is a good point. I forgot just how many different one-hit kill moves there is in Naruto. For some reason I was only thinking of Amaterasu and Rasenshuriken (probably because those are the two one-hit kill moves used by Sasuke and Naruto). Rasenshuriken is still definitely a one-hit kill move that normal characters should not be capable of surviving, but there's definitely a lot of other one-hit kill moves that are equal to or greater than Rasenshuriken in their lethality.",

It's got power and, eventually, adaptability with all the element combinations Naruto learned from the tailed beasts. It also scales up decently well, able to cut through a god tree pretty easily (once boosted by war arc amps). But it doesn't do anything that particle style can't do, it can't seal or trap unkillable enemies like Gaara's sand or Sai's paint or Obito/Kakashi's kamui, and its one-shot power against humans isn't top tier (though it's still high tier, especially at series end). \n\nOne thing I'll definitely grant to rasenshuriken is ease of use once mastered. There are several other supposedly awesome abilities that kinda suck from a practical aspect. Three of the Sage's tools, for example, only work when used together and are stupidly complex. Plus if you can bop someone with the rope tool you could just as easily cut them with a sword or other weapon, skipping all the word-game nonsense. Several of the Ninja Swords of the Mist are similarly underwhelming, like Helmet Splitter or the Executioner Sword, both of which offer minor advantages in exchange for being cumbersome. Hidan's ritual requires tons of setup. Truth Seeker Orbs are strong but nowhere near as strong as they are implied to be, and you need to go through tons of steps to unlock them. Half of Pain's abilities also seem overly complex or of little value in a fight, like the Asura Path (basically just a pointy guy with fancy paper bombs), Human Path (can't do anything without grabbing your head first), and Animal Path (doesn't do shit after the animals are summoned). \n\nAnd plenty of other one-shot abilities are locked behind special eyeballs or genetics, sometimes with soft caps on how much they can be used (soft caps because you can get around MS caps by unlocking EMS). Rasenshuriken can theoretically be learned by anyone with enough practice, patience, and chakra. So even though Naruto still gets hax power-ups because of his bloodline, he still has an \"everyman\" jutsu that he earned rather than one he unlocked through birth.",

Maybe some more like 2 or 3 that I forget, because they weren\u2019t impactful enough. Like they call him \"Copy Ninja Hatake Kakashi of the Sharingan\", they keep rubbing it on our face but they nearly never show sh-t to prove their point.\n\nOr even knowing about his family like his dad, talking about some big let down. We only know his name and that he was as strong as the Three Legendary Sanin. And no, we\u2019re not gonna talk about his mom.\n\nI don\u2019t remember Kakashi winning that much of fight alone like Naruto or Sasuke.\n\nI don\u2019t think they were fair with him either.

You're right to point out it wasn't used to kill many, if any characters. But this more has to do with the writing around Naruto's character than the lethality of the Rasenshuriken.\n\n>It mortally wounds one non-zetsu living person, Kakuzu, and that person is left alive long enough for Kakashi to steal the kill.\n\nPersonally, I don't have a lot of issues with the writing in Naruto (a lot of people will disagree with me on this but that's them) but this is one of my biggest ones. There is no way Kakuzu should have still been alive at all after getting hit with the Rasenshuriken. Yes, technically it killed him like four or five times over but he still had enough life left afterwards that Musashi Kishimoto could conveniently have someone other than Naruto kill him the final time. But we know that's bullshit from Tsunade's explanation of the Rasenshuriken. He should have been killed at least thousands of times over due to the extreme level of thoroughness with which the Rasenshuriken shreds things. It shreds so thoroughly that even all the individual molecules get shredded as well. There's no way that Kakuzu should have only died four or five times from that.\n\n>The move is powerful, sure.

I forgot just how many different one-hit kill moves there is in Naruto. For some reason I was only thinking of Amaterasu and Rasenshuriken (probably because those are the two one-hit kill moves used by Sasuke and Naruto). Rasenshuriken is still definitely a one-hit kill move that normal characters should not be capable of surviving, but there's definitely a lot of other one-hit kill moves that are equal to or greater than Rasenshuriken in their lethality.",

It's got power and, eventually, adaptability with all the element combinations Naruto learned from the tailed beasts. It also scales up decently well, able to cut through a god tree pretty easily (once boosted by war arc amps). But it doesn't do anything that particle style can't do, it can't seal or trap unkillable enemies like Gaara's sand or Sai's paint or Obito/Kakashi's kamui, and its one-shot power against humans isn't top tier (though it's still high tier, especially at series end). \n\nOne thing I'll definitely grant to rasenshuriken is ease of use once mastered. There are several other supposedly awesome abilities that kinda suck from a practical aspect. Three of the Sage's tools, for example, only work when used together and are stupidly complex. Plus if you can bop someone with the rope tool you could just as easily cut them with a sword or other weapon, skipping all the word-game nonsense. Several of the Ninja Swords of the Mist are similarly underwhelming, like Helmet Splitter or the Executioner Sword, both of which offer minor advantages in exchange for being cumbersome. Hidan's ritual requires tons of setup. Truth Seeker Orbs are strong but nowhere near as strong as they are implied to be, and you need to go through tons of steps to unlock them. Half of Pain's abilities also seem overly complex or of little value in a fight, like the Asura Path (basically just a pointy guy with fancy paper bombs), Human Path (can't do anything without grabbing your head first), and Animal Path (doesn't do shit after the animals are summoned). \n\nAnd plenty of other one-shot abilities are locked behind special eyeballs or genetics, sometimes with soft caps on how much they can be used (soft caps because you can get around MS caps by unlocking EMS). Rasenshuriken can theoretically be learned by anyone with enough practice, patience, and chakra. So even though Naruto still gets hax power-ups because of his bloodline, he still has an \"everyman\" jutsu that he earned rather than one he unlocked through birth.",

Maybe some more like 2 or 3 that I forget, because they weren\u2019t impactful enough. Like they call him \"Copy Ninja Hatake Kakashi of the Sharingan\", they keep rubbing it on our face but they nearly never show sh-t to prove their point.\n\nOr even knowing about his family like his dad, talking about some big let down. We only know his name and that he was as strong as the Three Legendary Sanin. And no, we\u2019re not gonna talk about his mom.\n\nI don\u2019t remember Kakashi winning that much of fight alone like Naruto or Sasuke.\n\nI don\u2019t think they were fair with him either. They didn\u2019t explore his full potential either, surely not as much as someone like Sai but they *cleary* could have done better with Kakashi.\n\nSo it\u2019s more like:\n\n\"Story of every character that isn\u2019t Naruto or Sasuke\"\n\nBecause Naruto and Sasuke were the real focus until the very end.

There is no way Kakuzu should have still been alive at all after getting hit with the Rasenshuriken. Yes, technically it killed him like four or five times over but he still had enough life left afterwards that Musashi Kishimoto could conveniently have someone other than Naruto kill him the final time. But we know that's bullshit from Tsunade's explanation of the Rasenshuriken. He should have been killed at least thousands of times over due to the extreme level of thoroughness with which the Rasenshuriken shreds things. It shreds so thoroughly that even all the individual molecules get shredded as well. There's no way that Kakuzu should have only died four or five times from that.\n\n>The move is powerful, sure.

Kakashi can send chunks of a target into the kamui dimension if he gets close enough and has enough chakra; he could warp away a target's head and immediately kill them. And there are abilities like the water bullet that will punch right through a person unless blocked with a strong enough technique.\n\nThis is a good point. I forgot just how many different one-hit kill moves there is in Naruto. For some reason I was only thinking of Amaterasu and Rasenshuriken (probably because those are the two one-hit kill moves used by Sasuke and Naruto). Rasenshuriken is still definitely a one-hit kill move that normal characters should not be capable of surviving, but there's definitely a lot of other one-hit kill moves that are equal to or greater than Rasenshuriken in their lethality.",

You're right to point out it wasn't used to kill many, if any characters. But this more has to do with the writing around Naruto's character than the lethality of the Rasenshuriken.\n\n>It mortally wounds one non-zetsu living person, Kakuzu, and that person is left alive long enough for Kakashi to steal the kill.\n\nPersonally, I don't have a lot of issues with the writing in Naruto (a lot of people will disagree with me on this but that's them) but this is one of my biggest ones. There is no way Kakuzu should have still been alive at all after getting hit with the Rasenshuriken. Yes, technically it killed him like four or five times over but he still had enough life left afterwards that Musashi Kishimoto could conveniently have someone other than Naruto kill him the final time. But we know that's bullshit from Tsunade's explanation of the Rasenshuriken. He should have been killed at least thousands of times over due to the extreme level of thoroughness with which the Rasenshuriken shreds things. It shreds so thoroughly that even all the individual molecules get shredded as well. There's no way that Kakuzu should have only died four or five times from that.\n\n>The move is powerful, sure.

            "body": ">It's strong, but not really all that lethal in the series.\n\nIt's an interesting caveat to say \"in the series\". You're right to point out it wasn't used to kill many, if any characters. But this more has to do with the writing around Naruto's character than the lethality of the Rasenshuriken.\n\n>It mortally wounds one non-zetsu living person, Kakuzu, and that person is left alive long enough for Kakashi to steal the kill.\n\nPersonally, I don't have a lot of issues with the writing in Naruto (a lot of people will disagree with me on this but that's them) but this is one of my biggest ones. There is no way Kakuzu should have still been alive at all after getting hit with the Rasenshuriken. Yes, technically it killed him like four or five times over but he still had enough life left afterwards that Musashi Kishimoto could conveniently have someone other than Naruto kill him the final time. But we know that's bullshit from Tsunade's explanation of the Rasenshuriken. He should have been killed at least thousands of times over due to the extreme level of thoroughness with which the Rasenshuriken shreds things. It shreds so thoroughly that even all the individual molecules get shredded as well. There's no way that Kakuzu should have only died four or five times from that.\n\n>The move is powerful, sure. But it has a much lower kill count than, say, raikiri/chidori. And we see plenty of lethal one-hit abilities in the show, even if they rarely actually work because they were used against targets with even more ridiculous abilities. Take particle style for example. It immediately deletes anything caught inside it's shape, and the shape can be quite massive. The only reason Sasuke survived is because he was pulled out of it by a third party who could move through walls; and the only reason Madara survived is because he was an edo tensei summon at the time. In the show, not sure about the manga, Asuma disintegrates an entire squad of three shinobi with a single blast of fire style. Sasori and Hanzo use poisons that one-shot anyone unless they get treated with antidotes; and very few people can make the antidotes. Kaguya's bones one-shot anyone they touch. Amaterasu always kills unless the user turns off the fire or the target sheds the part of their body that is ablaze. Kakashi can send chunks of a target into the kamui dimension if he gets close enough and has enough chakra; he could warp away a target's head and immediately kill them. And there are abilities like the water bullet that will punch right through a person unless blocked with a strong enough technique.\n\nThis is a good point. I forgot just how many different one-hit kill moves there is in Naruto. For some reason I was only thinking of Amaterasu and Rasenshuriken (probably because those are the two one-hit kill moves used by Sasuke and Naruto). Rasenshuriken is still definitely a one-hit kill move that normal characters should not be capable of surviving, but there's definitely a lot of other one-hit kill moves that are equal to or greater than Rasenshuriken in their lethality.",

But it doesn't do anything that particle style can't do, it can't seal or trap unkillable enemies like Gaara's sand or Sai's paint or Obito/Kakashi's kamui, and its one-shot power against humans isn't top tier (though it's still high tier, especially at series end). \n\nOne thing I'll definitely grant to rasenshuriken is ease of use once mastered. There are several other supposedly awesome abilities that kinda suck from a practical aspect. Three of the Sage's tools, for example, only work when used together and are stupidly complex.

Hidan's ritual requires tons of setup. Truth Seeker Orbs are strong but nowhere near as strong as they are implied to be, and you need to go through tons of steps to unlock them. Half of Pain's abilities also seem overly complex or of little value in a fight, like the Asura Path (basically just a pointy guy with fancy paper bombs), Human Path (can't do anything without grabbing your head first), and Animal Path (doesn't do shit after the animals are summoned). \n\nAnd plenty of other one-shot abilities are locked behind special eyeballs or genetics, sometimes with soft caps on how much they can be used (soft caps because you can get around MS caps by unlocking EMS). Rasenshuriken can theoretically be learned by anyone with enough practice, patience, and chakra. So even though Naruto still gets hax power-ups because of his bloodline, he still has an \"everyman\" jutsu that he earned rather than one he unlocked through birth.",
