But yeah, if you're watching it when it pushes life or death situations and you're continuously disappointment by it not actually becoming canon, it gets tiresome.  I want to say there's an episode in the filler hell arc of the original naruto where they they they're going to find Sasuke but end up running into another one-off bad guy.  That's really annoying if you don't know you're ass deep in a 90 episode content dry spell.",
