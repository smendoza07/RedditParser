    "body": "Recently, I have seen many posts from SDs on this forum complaining about the decline in quality of SB in the bowl. I would like to share my own experiences with SDs in SA from the past week, that made me want to quit the platform:\n\n\nSD1: We were having a great conversation, and we decided to schedule a video chat. He then asked me what ethnicity I was, after I told him my ethnicity, he immediately used an offensive language, made racist remarks, and expressed the worst stereotypes about my home country, and then blocked me. Although I am aware that racism exists in this world, I honestly didn't anticipate encountering it in SA. Additionally, rather than choosing \"all ethnicities\" in the seeking section if a sd is against a specific ethnicity, why not make this clear in his profile? Or perhaps why didn\u2019t he just block without offending me? I don't want to dwell on emotions here, even though I consider myself to be resilient to racism, his messages were way too harsh.\n\nSD2: He asked if I'd be willing to be a nanny for his child, as well as take care of his household, dog's needs and his needs. And I quote: \"the dog has needs, and so do I.\"\n\nSD3: A pot SD offered me a pity arrangement, saying \"If you make me really happy, I can give you up to (a 3-digit number) per month,\" with no gifts. I told him I make more than that working 3 times per week as a waitress and he responded with \"Keep working as a waitress, it's better.\"\n\nSD4: One man in SA listed in his profile the qualities he DIDN\u2019T want in a sb, such as goal-oriented, career-oriented, and vegetarian\u2026He approached me and said my profile was interesting. I point that I met the majority of the requirements he wasn't looking for, to which he responded, \"we just have to avoid talking about those topics.\" If not about our careers, aspirations, interests, or culinary preferences, what should we talk about?\n\nAdditionally, over 60% of SDs in SA (in Europe at least) explicitly state in their profile \"no financial arrangements.\"\n\nThe purpose of this post is to explain to SDs why the bowl contains subpar SBs. As a reliable SB, after only one week on the platform, my encounters with racism, disrespect, and a lack of genuine interest have made me want to quit and leave the platform to SBs who can put up with these approaches, scammers, and OF girls who want to sell content.",

I said it once and I\u2019ll say it again. Seeking going full vanilla has made it a waste of time for people like us, cause no one on there wants a real arrangement anymore. The SBs want to sell content and the SDs (well I shouldn\u2019t use that term) want to have a \u201cnon transactional\u201drelationship. \n\nCertain people here shame me for saying negative things about S- but the fact is it\u2019s a vanilla site now and they have made that very clear. It\u2019s NOT a good place to find an attractive woman who wants a traditional arrangement.",

There are no rules on there except I think it's obvious you shouldn't insult people or engage in any hate language at all..That being said, the range of SD's and SB's is a wide spectrum...and I have to sheepishly admit I may be partially responsible without knowing it before joining this forum.. I am very respectful, sensitive, polite and always act like a gentleman with women. But I guess I entered SA without even knowing that I probably shouldn't even be on there because I cannot provide financially what some women on there want....but, the site also carries and I've met and had arrangements with some women who are working their way through school, making enough to meet their basic needs but want extra income for all those things that a woman enjoys in pampering herself. Hair and nails done, massages, shopping at Sephora or Ultra etc. I've had 2 such arrangements with women who were very sincere I thought in telling me..\"I' don't want to break the bank with somebody. I just want some extras in my life\"...One was a young lady in medical school and when she graduated and got a position at a local hospital she said \"You know I don't need to do this anymore\"..It was agreed from the outset with her the arrangement would probably be just that..time limited to her being in med school. I was very happy for her success and we parted ways..You see I was a professional in the health-care field ( no not a Doc) and as my obligations to my college age children were met..I had some \"disposable income\" as I call it.. I was and am very upfront about that..and some pot SB's were fine with that level of assistance...I guess I'm a \"low quality\" SD and their \"low quality\" SBs. IDK And then I'm sure there are SD's on SA with private jets, multiple houses, exotic cars etc...It's become more and more clear to me that the site SA has a broad spectrum of SDs and SBs in terms of their expectations. The trick of course is lining up these 2 people with each other..",

I started right before Covid at the of 2019. I had some good luck at first. Then I took 9 months off. I got back on found a new SB right away. That lasted 3 months. Then I got so busy with my job I did not have time to sugar from March 2021-October. Took 4 months off came back. Found a SB for 4 months. She was fun, but not really an GF type. More of just a fun time. I wanted more of  connection. So I went back on found a good match. 4 months later. We parted ways. So exactly 1 year ago. I got back on the horse and I can say 2022 was the worst of them all. Got rinsed by 3 SBs in a row. Nothing but grifters, escorts, scammers, time wasters and all the above.\n\nSo, I changed my approach and now I found what I think is my best SB so far. I am very happy.\n\nSo moral of the story it takes time to find a great match: 36 months. 55 meet and greets. 100's of emails and dms all time wasters. I finally find a good match.",

So I moved it up to 25+. That is when I started to get better results. I quit dating SBs that had 'no job' or no other 'steady income streams' (mummy and daddy do not count).\n\nSo no more 'students' or anyone who did not have a full time job. Homeowners too. If renting I passed. I find women who own their own home are more reliable. More genuine and more what I like. ( I am not bashing a renter. Just my preference and experiences)\n\nI wanted to be an 'extra bonus' in their life. Not the one 'paying the bills'.\n\nAnd finally, I am sticking to the 4-A's. Attractive (to me), Attentive, Appreciative, and the biggest of them all. Affectionate!!!!! No more will ever date anyone who is not affectionate. I am very affectionate and hands on. I love to touch and caress my partner. I am not gropy or gross about it. Just my thing.\n\nEdit: I will also add Single Moms. They are much more reliable and know what they want. Most are less likely to be flakey. And they are on my schedule of 'early to bed and early to rise' with kids.  Sure, there will be dates where they have to cancel last minute or only have 4 hours on X or Y days. But so far it seems worth it.",

I\u2019m not active on the platform right now, thank god by the sounds of it! But I could share an almost exact similar experience from when I was last active based on my experience of fake, rude and entitled SBs. We are all going to come across them unfortunately and it\u2019s how we react and our attitude that matters. Once I got past the point where I knew how not to be scammed and I was savvy enough to not get into anything that would impact me either physically, financially or emotionally then all that is left is a bit of time wasting. Yes that\u2019s very annoying but not the end of the world. I spent huge amounts of time chasing business in the past that came to nothing. It\u2019s part of the game and we all need to accept it. But to your specific experiences: -\n\nSD1 - Nothing to say. Wrong in every sense. Honestly, I would report him as he should not be on dating sites if that is how he treats people.\n\nSD2 - Looks like he was on the wrong platform! Basically I would have laughed at this.\n\nSD3 - Another rude ah and clearly not serious, so just don\u2019t waste any more time.\n\nSD4 - Clearly not a match and very weird boundaries to set from him, again move on.\n\nIs it really 60% stating no rewards? Sounds a lot, but I agree with other comments; any serious SD knows that this is BS, so I would simply ignore the comment OR if you are really interested in the guy then the first message should be \u201coh, I assume this was a joke, wink wink\u201d.\n\nYour experience was in some cases really awful and completely unacceptable, in other cases rude and in others just weird. But if you have only been on the platform for a week, then I think most people will agree it can take time, persistence and extreme filtering to get down to the genuine matches. And it all depends on location, compatibility and some degree of luck.",

Having no/incomplete pictures is a big red flag for most reals SDs. Also, picture review takes a while on Seeking, pictures you might have posted 3-4 days ago might not be displayed on you profile yet, try waiting a little. Same goes for your description.",

                    "body": ">What was the change to your approach?\n\nI quit trying to date anyone under 25. Just not my cup of tea. Could not find anyone close to what I wanted. So I moved it up to 25+. That is when I started to get better results. I quit dating SBs that had 'no job' or no other 'steady income streams' (mummy and daddy do not count).\n\nSo no more 'students' or anyone who did not have a full time job. Homeowners too. If renting I passed. I find women who own their own home are more reliable. More genuine and more what I like. ( I am not bashing a renter. Just my preference and experiences)\n\nI wanted to be an 'extra bonus' in their life. Not the one 'paying the bills'.\n\nAnd finally, I am sticking to the 4-A's. Attractive (to me), Attentive, Appreciative, and the biggest of them all. Affectionate!!!!! No more will ever date anyone who is not affectionate. I am very affectionate and hands on. I love to touch and caress my partner. I am not gropy or gross about it. Just my thing.\n\nEdit: I will also add Single Moms. They are much more reliable and know what they want. Most are less likely to be flakey. And they are on my schedule of 'early to bed and early to rise' with kids.  Sure, there will be dates where they have to cancel last minute or only have 4 hours on X or Y days. But so far it seems worth it.",

As before, though, I am sorry you had to deal with the series of idiots, I cannot speak for other SD's on Seeking, only for myself, that I would never do any of those behaviors. I am though a legit one, who has had several very wonderful arrangements from there over the years, so I tend to respect the forum(even were I to act like that by nature, which thankfully I do not).",

That is when I started to get better results. I quit dating SBs that had 'no job' or no other 'steady income streams' (mummy and daddy do not count).\n\nSo no more 'students' or anyone who did not have a full time job. Homeowners too. If renting I passed. I find women who own their own home are more reliable. More genuine and more what I like. ( I am not bashing a renter. Just my preference and experiences)\n\nI wanted to be an 'extra bonus' in their life. Not the one 'paying the bills'.\n\nAnd finally, I am sticking to the 4-A's. Attractive (to me), Attentive, Appreciative, and the biggest of them all. Affectionate!!!!! No more will ever date anyone who is not affectionate. I am very affectionate and hands on. I love to touch and caress my partner. I am not gropy or gross about it. Just my thing.\n\nEdit: I will also add Single Moms. They are much more reliable and know what they want. Most are less likely to be flakey. And they are on my schedule of 'early to bed and early to rise' with kids.  Sure, there will be dates where they have to cancel last minute or only have 4 hours on X or Y days. But so far it seems worth it.",
