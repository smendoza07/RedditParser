Itchy is still number 1 to me without any rivals but if kishi added more character development for minato I\u2019d be willing to make an exception.

I don\u2019t think that young police version of sasuke could take out multiple adult uchiha back to back. He didn\u2019t have the hate, and the hate is what led to his strength.",

Naruto beating pain, the kids holding out THAT long against kimimaru, hidan and kakuzu dicking asuma and two other jonin but gets beat by a orange jump suit kid?? Neji getting uppercutted by orange jumpsuit kid who JUST got 64 palmed but he comes out the ground? Kisame losing every fight to team guy, the list goes on. Lots of fights where people only win because of plot. But, overall in my opinion, the power balancing of naruto is the best of any anime. It\u2019s roster is sooooooooooo large, but yet so refined and defined down to each characters abilities and thoughts. I loooooove power scaling naruto because it is the one anime where power is set, unlike krillan holding his own sparring with super saiyan god goku -____-",

Have you seen the fight? \n\nThe only reason Itachi was able to touch Nagato in the first place was because of Naruto and Bee. If you need to re watch the fight you can, but right after chibaku tensei exploded (and there was a flash of light) Nagato was stabbed, which was a surprise attack. \n\nWhen Itachi, Bee, and Naruto were being pulled into chibaku tensei, it took all of their strongest long range attacks to rupture it. Considering it took two jinchuriki with control of their tailed beast's chakra AND Itachi, I heavily doubt he could have gotten out on his own.\n\nAlso considering the fact that, during Naruto's fight with pain, one of the pains was already taken out. Pain also wasn't going with the full intent to kill, since he needed Naruto for the gedo statue. \n\nPain was also severely weakened during that fight, since he literally just used an almighty push the size of the village. As well as having been killing villagers by the hundreds hours prior.\n\n\nPlease tell me how, in any instance, could Itachi escape chibaku tensei? How can this be an argument when there's indisputable proof he cant, and that would be gg. No jutsu or power Itachi has can break it, so he loses to either pain or  Nagato.\n\nAnd just to clear up what you said earlier,  Obito>Pain>Itachi",

Nothing about the logic I used indicates that almighty push is an automatic win to anyone. You tried to say that A MOTHERFUCKING SHURIKEN would touch pain, and yes ALMIGHTY PUSH NULLIFIED AMETERASU which is canon. \n\nIf I must say it again, sage Naruto had the help of Ma, Pa, 3 other summoning toads, Pain at that point had perviously used an almighty push so large it \"shortened his life span\" and used more than half his chakra, he had gone around the village the whole day killing residence like it was nobodies business, one pain was already defeated, and Naruto only won because almost the full ninetails emerged.\n\nYou're just ignoring everything I said. Guy was out of the village because he would have opened the 8th gate. With the 8th gate Guy almost killed 10 tails Madara, so of fucking course he beats Pain, he leaves Itachi as a blood stain as well.\n\nI will repeat, you have not once made a valid argument as to how Itachi could beat Pain. You just keep saying that he would win without giving any scalable feats to support your statements. Give me a valid reason instead of just sucking off Itachi because you like him so much.",

Itchy is still number 1 to me without any rivals but if kishi added more character development for minato I\u2019d be willing to make an exception.

Neji getting uppercutted by orange jumpsuit kid who JUST got 64 palmed but he comes out the ground? Kisame losing every fight to team guy, the list goes on. Lots of fights where people only win because of plot. But, overall in my opinion, the power balancing of naruto is the best of any anime. It\u2019s roster is sooooooooooo large, but yet so refined and defined down to each characters abilities and thoughts. I loooooove power scaling naruto because it is the one anime where power is set, unlike krillan holding his own sparring with super saiyan god goku -____-",

Have you seen the fight? \n\nThe only reason Itachi was able to touch Nagato in the first place was because of Naruto and Bee. If you need to re watch the fight you can, but right after chibaku tensei exploded (and there was a flash of light) Nagato was stabbed, which was a surprise attack. \n\nWhen Itachi, Bee, and Naruto were being pulled into chibaku tensei, it took all of their strongest long range attacks to rupture it. Considering it took two jinchuriki with control of their tailed beast's chakra AND Itachi, I heavily doubt he could have gotten out on his own.\n\nAlso considering the fact that, during Naruto's fight with pain, one of the pains was already taken out. Pain also wasn't going with the full intent to kill, since he needed Naruto for the gedo statue. \n\nPain was also severely weakened during that fight, since he literally just used an almighty push the size of the village. As well as having been killing villagers by the hundreds hours prior.\n\n\nPlease tell me how, in any instance, could Itachi escape chibaku tensei? How can this be an argument when there's indisputable proof he cant, and that would be gg. No jutsu or power Itachi has can break it, so he loses to either pain or  Nagato.\n\nAnd just to clear up what you said earlier,  Obito>Pain>Itachi",

Neji getting uppercutted by orange jumpsuit kid who JUST got 64 palmed but he comes out the ground? Kisame losing every fight to team guy, the list goes on. Lots of fights where people only win because of plot. But, overall in my opinion, the power balancing of naruto is the best of any anime. It\u2019s roster is sooooooooooo large, but yet so refined and defined down to each characters abilities and thoughts. I loooooove power scaling naruto because it is the one anime where power is set, unlike krillan holding his own sparring with super saiyan god goku -____-",

Have you seen the fight? \n\nThe only reason Itachi was able to touch Nagato in the first place was because of Naruto and Bee. If you need to re watch the fight you can, but right after chibaku tensei exploded (and there was a flash of light) Nagato was stabbed, which was a surprise attack. \n\nWhen Itachi, Bee, and Naruto were being pulled into chibaku tensei, it took all of their strongest long range attacks to rupture it. Considering it took two jinchuriki with control of their tailed beast's chakra AND Itachi, I heavily doubt he could have gotten out on his own.\n\nAlso considering the fact that, during Naruto's fight with pain, one of the pains was already taken out. Pain also wasn't going with the full intent to kill, since he needed Naruto for the gedo statue. \n\nPain was also severely weakened during that fight, since he literally just used an almighty push the size of the village. As well as having been killing villagers by the hundreds hours prior.\n\n\nPlease tell me how, in any instance, could Itachi escape chibaku tensei? How can this be an argument when there's indisputable proof he cant, and that would be gg. No jutsu or power Itachi has can break it, so he loses to either pain or  Nagato.\n\nAnd just to clear up what you said earlier,  Obito>Pain>Itachi",

Nothing about the logic I used indicates that almighty push is an automatic win to anyone. You tried to say that A MOTHERFUCKING SHURIKEN would touch pain, and yes ALMIGHTY PUSH NULLIFIED AMETERASU which is canon. \n\nIf I must say it again, sage Naruto had the help of Ma, Pa, 3 other summoning toads, Pain at that point had perviously used an almighty push so large it \"shortened his life span\" and used more than half his chakra, he had gone around the village the whole day killing residence like it was nobodies business, one pain was already defeated, and Naruto only won because almost the full ninetails emerged.\n\nYou're just ignoring everything I said. Guy was out of the village because he would have opened the 8th gate. With the 8th gate Guy almost killed 10 tails Madara, so of fucking course he beats Pain, he leaves Itachi as a blood stain as well.\n\nI will repeat, you have not once made a valid argument as to how Itachi could beat Pain. You just keep saying that he would win without giving any scalable feats to support your statements. Give me a valid reason instead of just sucking off Itachi because you like him so much.",

Itchy is still number 1 to me without any rivals but if kishi added more character development for minato I\u2019d be willing to make an exception.

Neji getting uppercutted by orange jumpsuit kid who JUST got 64 palmed but he comes out the ground? Kisame losing every fight to team guy, the list goes on. Lots of fights where people only win because of plot. But, overall in my opinion, the power balancing of naruto is the best of any anime. It\u2019s roster is sooooooooooo large, but yet so refined and defined down to each characters abilities and thoughts. I loooooove power scaling naruto because it is the one anime where power is set, unlike krillan holding his own sparring with super saiyan god goku -____-",

Have you seen the fight? \n\nThe only reason Itachi was able to touch Nagato in the first place was because of Naruto and Bee. If you need to re watch the fight you can, but right after chibaku tensei exploded (and there was a flash of light) Nagato was stabbed, which was a surprise attack. \n\nWhen Itachi, Bee, and Naruto were being pulled into chibaku tensei, it took all of their strongest long range attacks to rupture it. Considering it took two jinchuriki with control of their tailed beast's chakra AND Itachi, I heavily doubt he could have gotten out on his own.\n\nAlso considering the fact that, during Naruto's fight with pain, one of the pains was already taken out. Pain also wasn't going with the full intent to kill, since he needed Naruto for the gedo statue. \n\nPain was also severely weakened during that fight, since he literally just used an almighty push the size of the village. As well as having been killing villagers by the hundreds hours prior.\n\n\nPlease tell me how, in any instance, could Itachi escape chibaku tensei? How can this be an argument when there's indisputable proof he cant, and that would be gg. No jutsu or power Itachi has can break it, so he loses to either pain or  Nagato.\n\nAnd just to clear up what you said earlier,  Obito>Pain>Itachi",

Nothing about the logic I used indicates that almighty push is an automatic win to anyone. You tried to say that A MOTHERFUCKING SHURIKEN would touch pain, and yes ALMIGHTY PUSH NULLIFIED AMETERASU which is canon. \n\nIf I must say it again, sage Naruto had the help of Ma, Pa, 3 other summoning toads, Pain at that point had perviously used an almighty push so large it \"shortened his life span\" and used more than half his chakra, he had gone around the village the whole day killing residence like it was nobodies business, one pain was already defeated, and Naruto only won because almost the full ninetails emerged.\n\nYou're just ignoring everything I said. Guy was out of the village because he would have opened the 8th gate. With the 8th gate Guy almost killed 10 tails Madara, so of fucking course he beats Pain, he leaves Itachi as a blood stain as well.\n\nI will repeat, you have not once made a valid argument as to how Itachi could beat Pain. You just keep saying that he would win without giving any scalable feats to support your statements. Give me a valid reason instead of just sucking off Itachi because you like him so much.",

Lots of fights where people only win because of plot. But, overall in my opinion, the power balancing of naruto is the best of any anime. It\u2019s roster is sooooooooooo large, but yet so refined and defined down to each characters abilities and thoughts. I loooooove power scaling naruto because it is the one anime where power is set, unlike krillan holding his own sparring with super saiyan god goku -____-",

Have you seen the fight? \n\nThe only reason Itachi was able to touch Nagato in the first place was because of Naruto and Bee. If you need to re watch the fight you can, but right after chibaku tensei exploded (and there was a flash of light) Nagato was stabbed, which was a surprise attack. \n\nWhen Itachi, Bee, and Naruto were being pulled into chibaku tensei, it took all of their strongest long range attacks to rupture it. Considering it took two jinchuriki with control of their tailed beast's chakra AND Itachi, I heavily doubt he could have gotten out on his own.\n\nAlso considering the fact that, during Naruto's fight with pain, one of the pains was already taken out. Pain also wasn't going with the full intent to kill, since he needed Naruto for the gedo statue. \n\nPain was also severely weakened during that fight, since he literally just used an almighty push the size of the village. As well as having been killing villagers by the hundreds hours prior.\n\n\nPlease tell me how, in any instance, could Itachi escape chibaku tensei? How can this be an argument when there's indisputable proof he cant, and that would be gg. No jutsu or power Itachi has can break it, so he loses to either pain or  Nagato.\n\nAnd just to clear up what you said earlier,  Obito>Pain>Itachi",

Nothing about the logic I used indicates that almighty push is an automatic win to anyone. You tried to say that A MOTHERFUCKING SHURIKEN would touch pain, and yes ALMIGHTY PUSH NULLIFIED AMETERASU which is canon. \n\nIf I must say it again, sage Naruto had the help of Ma, Pa, 3 other summoning toads, Pain at that point had perviously used an almighty push so large it \"shortened his life span\" and used more than half his chakra, he had gone around the village the whole day killing residence like it was nobodies business, one pain was already defeated, and Naruto only won because almost the full ninetails emerged.\n\nYou're just ignoring everything I said. Guy was out of the village because he would have opened the 8th gate. With the 8th gate Guy almost killed 10 tails Madara, so of fucking course he beats Pain, he leaves Itachi as a blood stain as well.\n\nI will repeat, you have not once made a valid argument as to how Itachi could beat Pain. You just keep saying that he would win without giving any scalable feats to support your statements. Give me a valid reason instead of just sucking off Itachi because you like him so much.",

Have you seen the fight? \n\nThe only reason Itachi was able to touch Nagato in the first place was because of Naruto and Bee. If you need to re watch the fight you can, but right after chibaku tensei exploded (and there was a flash of light) Nagato was stabbed, which was a surprise attack. \n\nWhen Itachi, Bee, and Naruto were being pulled into chibaku tensei, it took all of their strongest long range attacks to rupture it. Considering it took two jinchuriki with control of their tailed beast's chakra AND Itachi, I heavily doubt he could have gotten out on his own.\n\nAlso considering the fact that, during Naruto's fight with pain, one of the pains was already taken out. Pain also wasn't going with the full intent to kill, since he needed Naruto for the gedo statue. \n\nPain was also severely weakened during that fight, since he literally just used an almighty push the size of the village. As well as having been killing villagers by the hundreds hours prior.\n\n\nPlease tell me how, in any instance, could Itachi escape chibaku tensei? How can this be an argument when there's indisputable proof he cant, and that would be gg. No jutsu or power Itachi has can break it, so he loses to either pain or  Nagato.\n\nAnd just to clear up what you said earlier,  Obito>Pain>Itachi",

Have you seen the fight? \n\nThe only reason Itachi was able to touch Nagato in the first place was because of Naruto and Bee. If you need to re watch the fight you can, but right after chibaku tensei exploded (and there was a flash of light) Nagato was stabbed, which was a surprise attack. \n\nWhen Itachi, Bee, and Naruto were being pulled into chibaku tensei, it took all of their strongest long range attacks to rupture it. Considering it took two jinchuriki with control of their tailed beast's chakra AND Itachi, I heavily doubt he could have gotten out on his own.\n\nAlso considering the fact that, during Naruto's fight with pain, one of the pains was already taken out. Pain also wasn't going with the full intent to kill, since he needed Naruto for the gedo statue. \n\nPain was also severely weakened during that fight, since he literally just used an almighty push the size of the village. As well as having been killing villagers by the hundreds hours prior.\n\n\nPlease tell me how, in any instance, could Itachi escape chibaku tensei? How can this be an argument when there's indisputable proof he cant, and that would be gg. No jutsu or power Itachi has can break it, so he loses to either pain or  Nagato.\n\nAnd just to clear up what you said earlier,  Obito>Pain>Itachi",

Nothing about the logic I used indicates that almighty push is an automatic win to anyone. You tried to say that A MOTHERFUCKING SHURIKEN would touch pain, and yes ALMIGHTY PUSH NULLIFIED AMETERASU which is canon. \n\nIf I must say it again, sage Naruto had the help of Ma, Pa, 3 other summoning toads, Pain at that point had perviously used an almighty push so large it \"shortened his life span\" and used more than half his chakra, he had gone around the village the whole day killing residence like it was nobodies business, one pain was already defeated, and Naruto only won because almost the full ninetails emerged.\n\nYou're just ignoring everything I said. Guy was out of the village because he would have opened the 8th gate. With the 8th gate Guy almost killed 10 tails Madara, so of fucking course he beats Pain, he leaves Itachi as a blood stain as well.\n\nI will repeat, you have not once made a valid argument as to how Itachi could beat Pain. You just keep saying that he would win without giving any scalable feats to support your statements. Give me a valid reason instead of just sucking off Itachi because you like him so much.",

I agree with shikamaru becoming chunin in part 1, but if FUCKING NARUTO, who took out a tailed beast as a GENIN, which is a KAGE level feat, doesn\u2019t get chunin, it seems pretty stupid to me.",

Have you seen the fight? \n\nThe only reason Itachi was able to touch Nagato in the first place was because of Naruto and Bee. If you need to re watch the fight you can, but right after chibaku tensei exploded (and there was a flash of light) Nagato was stabbed, which was a surprise attack. \n\nWhen Itachi, Bee, and Naruto were being pulled into chibaku tensei, it took all of their strongest long range attacks to rupture it. Considering it took two jinchuriki with control of their tailed beast's chakra AND Itachi, I heavily doubt he could have gotten out on his own.\n\nAlso considering the fact that, during Naruto's fight with pain, one of the pains was already taken out. Pain also wasn't going with the full intent to kill, since he needed Naruto for the gedo statue. \n\nPain was also severely weakened during that fight, since he literally just used an almighty push the size of the village. As well as having been killing villagers by the hundreds hours prior.\n\n\nPlease tell me how, in any instance, could Itachi escape chibaku tensei? How can this be an argument when there's indisputable proof he cant, and that would be gg. No jutsu or power Itachi has can break it, so he loses to either pain or  Nagato.\n\nAnd just to clear up what you said earlier,  Obito>Pain>Itachi",

Have you seen the fight? \n\nThe only reason Itachi was able to touch Nagato in the first place was because of Naruto and Bee. If you need to re watch the fight you can, but right after chibaku tensei exploded (and there was a flash of light) Nagato was stabbed, which was a surprise attack. \n\nWhen Itachi, Bee, and Naruto were being pulled into chibaku tensei, it took all of their strongest long range attacks to rupture it. Considering it took two jinchuriki with control of their tailed beast's chakra AND Itachi, I heavily doubt he could have gotten out on his own.\n\nAlso considering the fact that, during Naruto's fight with pain, one of the pains was already taken out. Pain also wasn't going with the full intent to kill, since he needed Naruto for the gedo statue. \n\nPain was also severely weakened during that fight, since he literally just used an almighty push the size of the village. As well as having been killing villagers by the hundreds hours prior.\n\n\nPlease tell me how, in any instance, could Itachi escape chibaku tensei? How can this be an argument when there's indisputable proof he cant, and that would be gg. No jutsu or power Itachi has can break it, so he loses to either pain or  Nagato.\n\nAnd just to clear up what you said earlier,  Obito>Pain>Itachi",

Guy was out of the village because he would have opened the 8th gate.

If you need to re watch the fight you can, but right after chibaku tensei exploded (and there was a flash of light) Nagato was stabbed, which was a surprise attack. \n\nWhen Itachi, Bee, and Naruto were being pulled into chibaku tensei, it took all of their strongest long range attacks to rupture it. Considering it took two jinchuriki with control of their tailed beast's chakra AND Itachi, I heavily doubt he could have gotten out on his own.\n\nAlso considering the fact that, during Naruto's fight with pain, one of the pains was already taken out. Pain also wasn't going with the full intent to kill, since he needed Naruto for the gedo statue. \n\nPain was also severely weakened during that fight, since he literally just used an almighty push the size of the village. As well as having been killing villagers by the hundreds hours prior.\n\n\nPlease tell me how, in any instance, could Itachi escape chibaku tensei? How can this be an argument when there's indisputable proof he cant, and that would be gg. No jutsu or power Itachi has can break it, so he loses to either pain or  Nagato.\n\nAnd just to clear up what you said earlier,  Obito>Pain>Itachi",

Nothing about the logic I used indicates that almighty push is an automatic win to anyone. You tried to say that A MOTHERFUCKING SHURIKEN would touch pain, and yes ALMIGHTY PUSH NULLIFIED AMETERASU which is canon. \n\nIf I must say it again, sage Naruto had the help of Ma, Pa, 3 other summoning toads, Pain at that point had perviously used an almighty push so large it \"shortened his life span\" and used more than half his chakra, he had gone around the village the whole day killing residence like it was nobodies business, one pain was already defeated, and Naruto only won because almost the full ninetails emerged.\n\nYou're just ignoring everything I said. Guy was out of the village because he would have opened the 8th gate. With the 8th gate Guy almost killed 10 tails Madara, so of fucking course he beats Pain, he leaves Itachi as a blood stain as well.\n\nI will repeat, you have not once made a valid argument as to how Itachi could beat Pain. You just keep saying that he would win without giving any scalable feats to support your statements. Give me a valid reason instead of just sucking off Itachi because you like him so much.",

Have you seen the fight? \n\nThe only reason Itachi was able to touch Nagato in the first place was because of Naruto and Bee. If you need to re watch the fight you can, but right after chibaku tensei exploded (and there was a flash of light) Nagato was stabbed, which was a surprise attack. \n\nWhen Itachi, Bee, and Naruto were being pulled into chibaku tensei, it took all of their strongest long range attacks to rupture it. Considering it took two jinchuriki with control of their tailed beast's chakra AND Itachi, I heavily doubt he could have gotten out on his own.\n\nAlso considering the fact that, during Naruto's fight with pain, one of the pains was already taken out. Pain also wasn't going with the full intent to kill, since he needed Naruto for the gedo statue. \n\nPain was also severely weakened during that fight, since he literally just used an almighty push the size of the village. As well as having been killing villagers by the hundreds hours prior.\n\n\nPlease tell me how, in any instance, could Itachi escape chibaku tensei? How can this be an argument when there's indisputable proof he cant, and that would be gg. No jutsu or power Itachi has can break it, so he loses to either pain or  Nagato.\n\nAnd just to clear up what you said earlier,  Obito>Pain>Itachi",

Nothing about the logic I used indicates that almighty push is an automatic win to anyone. You tried to say that A MOTHERFUCKING SHURIKEN would touch pain, and yes ALMIGHTY PUSH NULLIFIED AMETERASU which is canon. \n\nIf I must say it again, sage Naruto had the help of Ma, Pa, 3 other summoning toads, Pain at that point had perviously used an almighty push so large it \"shortened his life span\" and used more than half his chakra, he had gone around the village the whole day killing residence like it was nobodies business, one pain was already defeated, and Naruto only won because almost the full ninetails emerged.\n\nYou're just ignoring everything I said. Guy was out of the village because he would have opened the 8th gate. With the 8th gate Guy almost killed 10 tails Madara, so of fucking course he beats Pain, he leaves Itachi as a blood stain as well.\n\nI will repeat, you have not once made a valid argument as to how Itachi could beat Pain. You just keep saying that he would win without giving any scalable feats to support your statements. Give me a valid reason instead of just sucking off Itachi because you like him so much.",
