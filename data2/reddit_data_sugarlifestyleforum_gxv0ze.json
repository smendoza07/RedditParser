    "body": "I read this forum a lot and have noticed a common pattern for dates: lunch/dinner and then sugar time. I don't understand how sex after eating works. I get a food baby after eating and feel a bit heavy. Tmi, but I also have quick bowel movements so I need to \"lighten up\" after eating. \n\nAm I the only one who experiences all this? \n\nHow do people on here in this lifestyle manage to have sex right after eating? \n\nAm I doing something wrong or should I be doing something differently? \n\nOn a side note, do you brush your teeth after eating or only pump some breath freshener?\n\nTIA!",

Not the brightest decision, but we made it work (and I was very proud of myself for not falling asleep because that\u2019s the effect pasta and wine has on me). We both also had a handful of mint on us, so we just popped some before we kissed. \n\nI also had another SD where I met him at his home, and for that we ended up being intimate first and then he cooked me dinner. I kinda prefer the reverse order just because I love falling asleep after a good fuck. \n\nBut if you\u2019re nervous about a food baby or impromptu bowel movements, settle for something light.",

I get reacquainted to my SD, catch up on how life has been in the last week or so since I've seen him, etc etc. And if I were to have sex first then I would fuss about getting ready for the date and making sure I don't look freshly tumbled while eating.\n\nAlso I don't worry about brushing my teeth or using breath spray - I just don't eat a bunch of onions or garlic or whatever and I drink a bunch of water while eating.",

If you think about a 6 hour dinner date;  you consume most of the food likely 30 - 75 minutes into the date.  You then have 2 hours of talking, hanging out, digesting before sex is coming up.  \n\n2.  While we might go out to eat most dates in the first month - it's very common that stops being an every date thing.  Instead, more ordering in.  (which has the benefit of sex before & after).  \n\n3.  On shorter dinner dates - we are likely going somewhere more casual.  I'm simply not going to eat a \"full\" meal in the standard sense (that you would when fine dining).  No bread;  appetizer.  My normal go to is to order a steak;  say, a rib eye.  But ask for no sides.  I know everyone is different - but as MUCH as I love steak, it's very hard for me to \"over eat\" meat if there are no carbs around.  So limiting this, keeps me better for later.",

Also, every once in a while, some big muscle boy gets a \"WTF!\" response and goes for the aggressive eye contact \"you could do better\" routine.  That can be a touch uncomfortable, but quite fun afterwards.  Also, if she knows you well and packed a comfort outfit that can be fun.

If I stay the night, 50/50 chance of one more time in the morning. Sometimes he\u2019s too worn out. haha \n\nI admit that I don\u2019t usually eat as much as I\u2019d like to. As for going to the bathroom, I\u2019m one of those people who won\u2019t even feel the urge if I\u2019m not at home. I guess that\u2019s good and bad. I\u2019ve noticed he has wipes in his bathroom so if I ever needed to I\u2019d just use those - or preferably shower. Sorry tmi and maybe not even helpful to the convo.

It consists of feminine wipes, an empty enema bottle, lube, a small bottle of air freshener and extra panties. I've got it so it all flits in a makeup bag. I also have a mini tooth brush and paste and icebreakers gum.\n\nIf I have a BM after dinner I can use the enema to further cleanse with warm water and freshen up with feminine wipes. The lube it for the enema tip. Extra panties because you never know. Air freshener because a lady should never leave a bad impression.\n\nSD's & SB's are human, humans have bodily functions. In time you can address them, but until then it's nice to be prepared anyways.",

Maybe something along the lines of:  \"Would you enjoy having sex before dinner instead?  I love having sex right away when I'm super energized, and after dinner I always feel a little more bloated\".\n\nSo, make it about how much better the sex will be if we have it before dinner, and then just a subtle mention of being bloated or stomach upset, and I think most guys will get it.\n\nQuestion: would some drinks at the bar to warm us up so we can flirt and get a little horny work?  Or does that kick off the GI runaway reaction?",

The reason I asked is because what I might struggle with a bit is: you show up to the room, we exchange niceties, and 10 minutes later we're having sex.  I like to be positively *aching* for her by the time we're having sex; my IQ should have dropped at least 20 points.  That's easily accomplished: go to the hotel bar, talk and flirt and drink (the drinking is less important than the talking and flirting), then head upstairs when I can't keep my hands off her.  THAT would work fine for me.  But at least 30-60 minutes of socializing first.\n\nTL;DR: You want that primo Vitamin Azure, you gotta warm me up first \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23",

The reason I asked is because what I might struggle with a bit is: you show up to the room, we exchange niceties, and 10 minutes later we're having sex.  I like to be positively *aching* for her by the time we're having sex; my IQ should have dropped at least 20 points.  That's easily accomplished: go to the hotel bar, talk and flirt and drink (the drinking is less important than the talking and flirting), then head upstairs when I can't keep my hands off her.  THAT would work fine for me.  But at least 30-60 minutes of socializing first.\n\nTL;DR: You want that primo Vitamin Azure, you gotta warm me up first \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23",
