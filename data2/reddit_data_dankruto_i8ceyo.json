Guy can (and demonstrably will) kick you so goddamn hard that space bends around the point of impact before both your bodies disintegrate. \n\nI'll grant Sasuke as the worst nightmare of an enemy though. Dude's got inextinguishable flames, torturous genjutsu, giant chakra Gundam, and just as much lightning as Kakashi. And, at least in the time between squashing Danzo and getting disarmed by Naruto, dude has absolutely no qualms about killing even his closest friends and allies.",

Dude took an Eight Gates attack to the face just to see how much it would hurt, and he took half his body being disintegrated as if it hurt less than being lightly slapped. Even before he got 10-tails powers, he was calling down small moons to squash entire armies. \n\nAnd then there are the shinobi who specialize in torture and interrogation. Ibiki, for example, had a jutsu devoted entirely to inflicting pain on his victims in a sealed chakra chamber.\n\nAnd I shudder thinking of all the experiments Orochimaru and his crew inflicted on his victims/prisoners/citizens. Karin, for example, despite seeming like a relatively nice person when around Sasuke, was butchering any prisoners who dared to speculate that Orochimaru might have been not visiting because he had been defeated. And when Orochimaru did visit, he was forcing shinobi into deathmatches or using them as fodder to train Sasuke or stealing their bodies or trying out weird new jutsu on them. \n\nAnd we can't forget Danzo. Dude so evil he sent assassins after a child working on his own side, who blackmailed an orphan and the woman who ran the orphanage to become secret agents and then forced them to kill each other, who raised Anbu in teams of two and killed both unless one killed the other, who forced the slaughter of an entire clan within his village, who essentially created Pain, who backed Orochimaru's experiments, who tried to kill the Hokage out of jealousy, who stabbed an innocent Toad ally to death, etc. \n\nItachi is a mean motherfucker, but I'd rather he kill me than let me fall into the hands of one of those others. Only things to really worry about are being sealed in his Gundam jar or being caught in a torture genjutsu. But at least most people survived the torture genjutsu when it was over.",

It's just a job he's good at. But no joke, he can literally put you in his genjutsu, and let you live a perfect life, Everything is great and sunshine and you don't even know it's fake. You grow old, and on your deathbed, itachi just shows up and says \"ha pysch\" and pops you out of the genjutsu just for your head to explode because you lived out to be 80 years old in your head. Like, he can take your life goals, show you achieving them and then bring you back to real life just so he can punch you in the mouth and fuck your bitch",

Dude took an Eight Gates attack to the face just to see how much it would hurt, and he took half his body being disintegrated as if it hurt less than being lightly slapped. Even before he got 10-tails powers, he was calling down small moons to squash entire armies. \n\nAnd then there are the shinobi who specialize in torture and interrogation. Ibiki, for example, had a jutsu devoted entirely to inflicting pain on his victims in a sealed chakra chamber.\n\nAnd I shudder thinking of all the experiments Orochimaru and his crew inflicted on his victims/prisoners/citizens. Karin, for example, despite seeming like a relatively nice person when around Sasuke, was butchering any prisoners who dared to speculate that Orochimaru might have been not visiting because he had been defeated. And when Orochimaru did visit, he was forcing shinobi into deathmatches or using them as fodder to train Sasuke or stealing their bodies or trying out weird new jutsu on them. \n\nAnd we can't forget Danzo. Dude so evil he sent assassins after a child working on his own side, who blackmailed an orphan and the woman who ran the orphanage to become secret agents and then forced them to kill each other, who raised Anbu in teams of two and killed both unless one killed the other, who forced the slaughter of an entire clan within his village, who essentially created Pain, who backed Orochimaru's experiments, who tried to kill the Hokage out of jealousy, who stabbed an innocent Toad ally to death, etc. \n\nItachi is a mean motherfucker, but I'd rather he kill me than let me fall into the hands of one of those others. Only things to really worry about are being sealed in his Gundam jar or being caught in a torture genjutsu. But at least most people survived the torture genjutsu when it was over.",

Dude took an Eight Gates attack to the face just to see how much it would hurt, and he took half his body being disintegrated as if it hurt less than being lightly slapped. Even before he got 10-tails powers, he was calling down small moons to squash entire armies. \n\nAnd then there are the shinobi who specialize in torture and interrogation. Ibiki, for example, had a jutsu devoted entirely to inflicting pain on his victims in a sealed chakra chamber.\n\nAnd I shudder thinking of all the experiments Orochimaru and his crew inflicted on his victims/prisoners/citizens. Karin, for example, despite seeming like a relatively nice person when around Sasuke, was butchering any prisoners who dared to speculate that Orochimaru might have been not visiting because he had been defeated. And when Orochimaru did visit, he was forcing shinobi into deathmatches or using them as fodder to train Sasuke or stealing their bodies or trying out weird new jutsu on them. \n\nAnd we can't forget Danzo. Dude so evil he sent assassins after a child working on his own side, who blackmailed an orphan and the woman who ran the orphanage to become secret agents and then forced them to kill each other, who raised Anbu in teams of two and killed both unless one killed the other, who forced the slaughter of an entire clan within his village, who essentially created Pain, who backed Orochimaru's experiments, who tried to kill the Hokage out of jealousy, who stabbed an innocent Toad ally to death, etc. \n\nItachi is a mean motherfucker, but I'd rather he kill me than let me fall into the hands of one of those others. Only things to really worry about are being sealed in his Gundam jar or being caught in a torture genjutsu. But at least most people survived the torture genjutsu when it was over.",

But no joke, he can literally put you in his genjutsu, and let you live a perfect life, Everything is great and sunshine and you don't even know it's fake. You grow old, and on your deathbed, itachi just shows up and says \"ha pysch\" and pops you out of the genjutsu just for your head to explode because you lived out to be 80 years old in your head. Like, he can take your life goals, show you achieving them and then bring you back to real life just so he can punch you in the mouth and fuck your bitch",

Dude took an Eight Gates attack to the face just to see how much it would hurt, and he took half his body being disintegrated as if it hurt less than being lightly slapped. Even before he got 10-tails powers, he was calling down small moons to squash entire armies. \n\nAnd then there are the shinobi who specialize in torture and interrogation. Ibiki, for example, had a jutsu devoted entirely to inflicting pain on his victims in a sealed chakra chamber.\n\nAnd I shudder thinking of all the experiments Orochimaru and his crew inflicted on his victims/prisoners/citizens. Karin, for example, despite seeming like a relatively nice person when around Sasuke, was butchering any prisoners who dared to speculate that Orochimaru might have been not visiting because he had been defeated. And when Orochimaru did visit, he was forcing shinobi into deathmatches or using them as fodder to train Sasuke or stealing their bodies or trying out weird new jutsu on them. \n\nAnd we can't forget Danzo. Dude so evil he sent assassins after a child working on his own side, who blackmailed an orphan and the woman who ran the orphanage to become secret agents and then forced them to kill each other, who raised Anbu in teams of two and killed both unless one killed the other, who forced the slaughter of an entire clan within his village, who essentially created Pain, who backed Orochimaru's experiments, who tried to kill the Hokage out of jealousy, who stabbed an innocent Toad ally to death, etc. \n\nItachi is a mean motherfucker, but I'd rather he kill me than let me fall into the hands of one of those others. Only things to really worry about are being sealed in his Gundam jar or being caught in a torture genjutsu. But at least most people survived the torture genjutsu when it was over.",

Dude took an Eight Gates attack to the face just to see how much it would hurt, and he took half his body being disintegrated as if it hurt less than being lightly slapped. Even before he got 10-tails powers, he was calling down small moons to squash entire armies. \n\nAnd then there are the shinobi who specialize in torture and interrogation. Ibiki, for example, had a jutsu devoted entirely to inflicting pain on his victims in a sealed chakra chamber.\n\nAnd I shudder thinking of all the experiments Orochimaru and his crew inflicted on his victims/prisoners/citizens. Karin, for example, despite seeming like a relatively nice person when around Sasuke, was butchering any prisoners who dared to speculate that Orochimaru might have been not visiting because he had been defeated. And when Orochimaru did visit, he was forcing shinobi into deathmatches or using them as fodder to train Sasuke or stealing their bodies or trying out weird new jutsu on them. \n\nAnd we can't forget Danzo. Dude so evil he sent assassins after a child working on his own side, who blackmailed an orphan and the woman who ran the orphanage to become secret agents and then forced them to kill each other, who raised Anbu in teams of two and killed both unless one killed the other, who forced the slaughter of an entire clan within his village, who essentially created Pain, who backed Orochimaru's experiments, who tried to kill the Hokage out of jealousy, who stabbed an innocent Toad ally to death, etc. \n\nItachi is a mean motherfucker, but I'd rather he kill me than let me fall into the hands of one of those others. Only things to really worry about are being sealed in his Gundam jar or being caught in a torture genjutsu. But at least most people survived the torture genjutsu when it was over.",

Like, he can take your life goals, show you achieving them and then bring you back to real life just so he can punch you in the mouth and fuck your bitch",

Dude took an Eight Gates attack to the face just to see how much it would hurt, and he took half his body being disintegrated as if it hurt less than being lightly slapped. Even before he got 10-tails powers, he was calling down small moons to squash entire armies. \n\nAnd then there are the shinobi who specialize in torture and interrogation. Ibiki, for example, had a jutsu devoted entirely to inflicting pain on his victims in a sealed chakra chamber.\n\nAnd I shudder thinking of all the experiments Orochimaru and his crew inflicted on his victims/prisoners/citizens. Karin, for example, despite seeming like a relatively nice person when around Sasuke, was butchering any prisoners who dared to speculate that Orochimaru might have been not visiting because he had been defeated. And when Orochimaru did visit, he was forcing shinobi into deathmatches or using them as fodder to train Sasuke or stealing their bodies or trying out weird new jutsu on them. \n\nAnd we can't forget Danzo. Dude so evil he sent assassins after a child working on his own side, who blackmailed an orphan and the woman who ran the orphanage to become secret agents and then forced them to kill each other, who raised Anbu in teams of two and killed both unless one killed the other, who forced the slaughter of an entire clan within his village, who essentially created Pain, who backed Orochimaru's experiments, who tried to kill the Hokage out of jealousy, who stabbed an innocent Toad ally to death, etc. \n\nItachi is a mean motherfucker, but I'd rather he kill me than let me fall into the hands of one of those others. Only things to really worry about are being sealed in his Gundam jar or being caught in a torture genjutsu. But at least most people survived the torture genjutsu when it was over.",

You grow old, and on your deathbed, itachi just shows up and says \"ha pysch\" and pops you out of the genjutsu just for your head to explode because you lived out to be 80 years old in your head. Like, he can take your life goals, show you achieving them and then bring you back to real life just so he can punch you in the mouth and fuck your bitch",
