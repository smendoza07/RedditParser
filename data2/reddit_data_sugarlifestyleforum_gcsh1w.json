    "body": "**Should I thank him for the allowance he sent?**\n\nThis is a common question on this forum. And the consensus is, yes you should thank him for what he's sent. But do so in a way that doesn't have you saying: *Hey Daddy, Thanks for the Dough!*\n\nYou know, unless of course he's into that.\n\nIn a time of 'Rona Lockdown a lot of people are asking, *How Do I Keep Him Interested?*\n\nBut not many people are asking, *How Do I Stay Engaged?*\n\nGrowing up, I was taught you always say please and thank you. As an adult, I've always found that my relationships fared better when I took that one step further. Make an effort to stay engaged. And no, I don't mean more blow jobs.\n\nIt's simple really. The vast majority of sugar daddies are married men. And let me give you a piece of advice about marriage. It's not always about sex. Relationships fail because people take each other for granted. After being married for quite some time those please and thank you's become something of the past. Why? Because the things we do become requirements. And the thing about requirements? No one likes doing them.\n\nOf course you should thank your SD for the YSL clutch he bought you. Or that time he sent you money to fix your car. An easy, *Thanks for everything you do for me*, can suffice in most situations regarding money.\n\nBut what about those non monetary things he does? Those have much more value to him, because it's not required he do them. You should take the time to give a big heartfelt thank you for those as well. And do it often. Because if he's married, I promise you, he most likely ain't getting it \\[thank you\\] at home.\n\nIt'll be nine months soon with my guy. We're in 'Rona Lockdown ourselves. I can officially say I've got myself a big ol' platonic relationship. (They do exist!) It's not that we want to be, but we are for the better good. (And also, no option otherwise.) So how do we keep things going? We stay engaged. And we talk. We talk often.\n\nThe other night I was complaining to my guy about how my oldest wore a pair of white Keds out into the yard. And they are now no longer white. Who does that? Who wears white Keds into a muddy yard? Three washes later and I was losing hope. Mid conversation my guy stops responding. I send a few messages: \"Hey, you okay?\" He comes back online and says, \"Sorry. I was googling how to clean Keds.\"\n\nIn relationships, especially long term ones, these things could be seen as the norm. Pick up milk. Do the laundry. Make dinner. Clean the House. Work extra hours. Google how to fix the shower head. These are requirements to assist your partner. They are not things you do because you want to. No one wants to work a twelve hour shift to come home and unclog the toilet too. Really. No one wants to do that.\n\nMy father was a shitty human. No one will dispute that. But, no fail, after every meal he turned to my stepmother and said, \"Thank you for making dinner, my love.\"\n\nIt seems simple, but many people don't realize it. Affirmation of a deed leads to deed continuation. If my father didn't thank her, didn't give a heartfelt thank you, eventually my stepmother would see that dinner as a chore. Something she had to do for a man that didn't appreciate it. Instead she slaved away for hours. Googled recipes to try. Bought fresh produce after work every day. He was a shitty human outside of that. But no fail, every dinner, he thanked her. *Thank you for feeding us when others have nothing.* I mean really, when you put it that way, that chore is a pretty big fucking deal.\n\nThank your daddy. The sugar kind. And maybe the blood related kind, too. If he's not an ass-hat.\n\nI try to be thankful all the time. Thank you for that restaurant you chose. Thank you for pre-booking the parking garage for me. Thank you for the book you bought me. Thank you for googling how to clean Keds. Thank you for asking me if I need anything, even if you just sent me an allowance. *Thank you for continuing to do these little things you do. The ones that aren't required of you.*\n\nThis advice could be applied to any type of relationship. Vanilla. Sugar. Friends with Benefits. Even just friends. A long time ago my children's father and I were having a hard time. We took each other both for granted. I hadn't seen him smile in months. One day, after a particularly long work day, he came home with a big scowl. I tried everything to cheer him up. I mean everything. Finally, I just put my arms around him and said, \"Thank you for working so hard for us.\"\n\nBlow jobs. Fancy Dinners. Clean Houses. Time alone. None of these things could wipe the frown off my husbands face. But that statement, that small affirmation of - thank you for the thing you do that seems like a chore - brought out the biggest smile I'd seen in years.\n\nBe thankful. Be thankful for the big things, that one's obvious. If you don't say thank you for that time your friend bailed you out of jail, well then, you're a shit head. But if you take a moment to thank someone for the little things, well, that's a true thank you. A grateful thank you.\n\nThis morning I sent a note to my SD: I love that you try to help. The fact that you googled cleaning Keds makes my heart swell. I know you do that a lot. You put a ton of thought and research into things for me and I appreciate it.\n\nSo if you're feeling lonely in 'Rona Lockdown and want to do something nice for your SD, write a heartfelt note about something intangible that he does. It's okay if it's short,\n\n*I love that you \\[did that / do that thing\\] for me. It makes my day.*\n\nAnd then, watch his frown turn upside down. Or, if you're still in lockdown too, the emoji he sends will have to suffice.\n\n\ud83d\ude1f\ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude03\n\n**What will you thank your daddy for today?**\n\nTLDR: Thank your daddy. \\[*Obvious post is obvious.\\]*",
