    "body": "The previous episode of \"Nogari Day\" was held as a talk-only race throughout the shoot, introducing not only the all-time opening of 70 minutes, but also the behind-the-scenes stories that had not been released so far, making it a legendary episode in various communities.\n\nViewers' comments flooded, saying, \"I want to see the unreleased talk of the show,\" and \"Running Man\" production team decided to release additional unreleased talk of the race this week, reflecting the opinions of viewers who showed unchanging interest and love.\n\nOne of them was about the feud between Ji Seok-jin and Haha in the early days of Running Man, which was mentioned last week. Haha even mentioned that time, \"I knew Ji Seok-jin hated me,\" and later, Ji Seok-jin and Haha became close. Haha said, \"There was a moment when the wall with my brother collapsed,\" and revealed how they opened their minds by forming a consensus with each other.\n\nIn addition, they plan to release additional episodes of the early 'Running Man' that viewers were curious about. The chatting time of the members who have not yet finished talking can be found in \u2018Running Man\u2019, which will be broadcasted at 5 pm on Sunday, the 11th.\n\n[Source](https://www.stardailynews.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=303122)",
