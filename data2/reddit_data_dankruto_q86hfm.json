The latter two almost never hang out and aren't really goofy with each other (maybe they're a bit goofy). The only thing they really have going for each other is mutual understanding. But Sasuke was never there for Naruto. shikamaru was there for Naruto when jiraiya died, and he supported him as hokage advisor. They also seem to have more friendly/goofy interactions throughout the entire series, even before Shippuden. These are just my thoughts",

The latter two almost never hang out and aren't really goofy with each other (maybe they're a bit goofy). The only thing they really have going for each other is mutual understanding. But Sasuke was never there for Naruto. shikamaru was there for Naruto when jiraiya died, and he supported him as hokage advisor. They also seem to have more friendly/goofy interactions throughout the entire series, even before Shippuden. These are just my thoughts",

I thought he always called him his friend. Shikamaru and Choji definitely have best friend qualities, which I feel like Naruto and Sasuke lack. The latter two almost never hang out and aren't really goofy with each other (maybe they're a bit goofy). The only thing they really have going for each other is mutual understanding. But Sasuke was never there for Naruto. shikamaru was there for Naruto when jiraiya died, and he supported him as hokage advisor. They also seem to have more friendly/goofy interactions throughout the entire series, even before Shippuden. These are just my thoughts",
