He had the fringe around the back of his head from ear to ear. I told him to shave it. He was otherwise a good looking guy. He shaved it and it made him look 10 years younger. Now he\u2019s remarried and living happily ever after. Idk. I like it on most men. \ud83d\ude01",

Sometimes the first week or two it has a kind of new look, but it goes away after it\u2019s been shaved a few times. So, my advice is this. Less is more, ALWAYS. The trick is to NOT ask everyone, \u201cAre you sure you like it? I\u2019m not sure what to think\u2026\u201d You approach it like this- Walk into the room with a hat on, remove the hat, ask people in the room if they want to touch your newly bald head for good luck! If anyone has the audacity to say anything, you reply, grass doesn\u2019t grow on a playground! There are a million more we\u2019re that comes from. How about the fact that baldness is caused by an excess of testosterone, ask them what their excuses is? LOL shave, grow a goatee! It\u2019s sexy!",

That\u2019s on a scale of 1-10. If you carry yourself with CONFIDENCE, head held level, shoulders back, stand straight, walk with meaning, no one will gawk at your head. If you walk in with your head down, your hand on your head, stop at the first person you see, and whisper, \u201cis it bad?\u201d Which one do you think will be better received? \n\nYou can\u2019t control how you look.

Sometimes the first week or two it has a kind of new look, but it goes away after it\u2019s been shaved a few times. So, my advice is this. Less is more, ALWAYS. The trick is to NOT ask everyone, \u201cAre you sure you like it? I\u2019m not sure what to think\u2026\u201d You approach it like this- Walk into the room with a hat on, remove the hat, ask people in the room if they want to touch your newly bald head for good luck! If anyone has the audacity to say anything, you reply, grass doesn\u2019t grow on a playground! There are a million more we\u2019re that comes from. How about the fact that baldness is caused by an excess of testosterone, ask them what their excuses is? LOL shave, grow a goatee! It\u2019s sexy!",

That\u2019s on a scale of 1-10. If you carry yourself with CONFIDENCE, head held level, shoulders back, stand straight, walk with meaning, no one will gawk at your head.

The trick is to NOT ask everyone, \u201cAre you sure you like it? I\u2019m not sure what to think\u2026\u201d You approach it like this- Walk into the room with a hat on, remove the hat, ask people in the room if they want to touch your newly bald head for good luck! If anyone has the audacity to say anything, you reply, grass doesn\u2019t grow on a playground! There are a million more we\u2019re that comes from. How about the fact that baldness is caused by an excess of testosterone, ask them what their excuses is? LOL shave, grow a goatee! It\u2019s sexy!",
