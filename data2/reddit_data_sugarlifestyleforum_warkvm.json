A high percentage of SBs are submissive, so a lot of men will claim to be Dominant when they either don't know what they are doing or are  the fake abusive types.  \n\nAfter an appropriate amount of interaction, you can bring up sexual preferences. If I'm asked, I will explain that I am Dominant and what that means to me. If she doesn't bring it up, I won't bring it up until after our first intimacy.  \n\nDuring our first intimacy, I will introduce some very light forms of D/s play by lightly spanking her, placing my hand on her throat or back of her neck or restraining one arm behind her back.  I will gage how she reacts. As we lay together in bed after, I will ask about what she liked and didn't like.  Only if she seems comfortable with it, will I bring up my preference for dominant sex and what that means to me. Most will express interest and we will discuss in more depth about safety, safe words/signals and boundaries.  We will discuss more about what she likes, what she doesn't like, how she shows pleasure, discomfort and pain.  We will discuss about what she would like to try next time.  It's a great way to practice disclosure and consent, and build anticipation for our next meet.  \n\nIn my experience, 90+% of SBs seem to be open to a D/s relationship with an experienced partner they trust that can \"show them the ropes\" (pun intended lol).",

A high percentage of SBs are submissive, so a lot of men will claim to be Dominant when they either don't know what they are doing or are  the fake abusive types.  \n\nAfter an appropriate amount of interaction, you can bring up sexual preferences. If I'm asked, I will explain that I am Dominant and what that means to me. If she doesn't bring it up, I won't bring it up until after our first intimacy.  \n\nDuring our first intimacy, I will introduce some very light forms of D/s play by lightly spanking her, placing my hand on her throat or back of her neck or restraining one arm behind her back.  I will gage how she reacts. As we lay together in bed after, I will ask about what she liked and didn't like.  Only if she seems comfortable with it, will I bring up my preference for dominant sex and what that means to me. Most will express interest and we will discuss in more depth about safety, safe words/signals and boundaries.  We will discuss more about what she likes, what she doesn't like, how she shows pleasure, discomfort and pain.  We will discuss about what she would like to try next time.  It's a great way to practice disclosure and consent, and build anticipation for our next meet.  \n\nIn my experience, 90+% of SBs seem to be open to a D/s relationship with an experienced partner they trust that can \"show them the ropes\" (pun intended lol).",

A high percentage of SBs are submissive, so a lot of men will claim to be Dominant when they either don't know what they are doing or are  the fake abusive types.  \n\nAfter an appropriate amount of interaction, you can bring up sexual preferences. If I'm asked, I will explain that I am Dominant and what that means to me. If she doesn't bring it up, I won't bring it up until after our first intimacy.  \n\nDuring our first intimacy, I will introduce some very light forms of D/s play by lightly spanking her, placing my hand on her throat or back of her neck or restraining one arm behind her back.  I will gage how she reacts. As we lay together in bed after, I will ask about what she liked and didn't like.  Only if she seems comfortable with it, will I bring up my preference for dominant sex and what that means to me. Most will express interest and we will discuss in more depth about safety, safe words/signals and boundaries.  We will discuss more about what she likes, what she doesn't like, how she shows pleasure, discomfort and pain.  We will discuss about what she would like to try next time.  It's a great way to practice disclosure and consent, and build anticipation for our next meet.  \n\nIn my experience, 90+% of SBs seem to be open to a D/s relationship with an experienced partner they trust that can \"show them the ropes\" (pun intended lol).",

A high percentage of SBs are submissive, so a lot of men will claim to be Dominant when they either don't know what they are doing or are  the fake abusive types.  \n\nAfter an appropriate amount of interaction, you can bring up sexual preferences. If I'm asked, I will explain that I am Dominant and what that means to me. If she doesn't bring it up, I won't bring it up until after our first intimacy.  \n\nDuring our first intimacy, I will introduce some very light forms of D/s play by lightly spanking her, placing my hand on her throat or back of her neck or restraining one arm behind her back.  I will gage how she reacts. As we lay together in bed after, I will ask about what she liked and didn't like.  Only if she seems comfortable with it, will I bring up my preference for dominant sex and what that means to me. Most will express interest and we will discuss in more depth about safety, safe words/signals and boundaries.  We will discuss more about what she likes, what she doesn't like, how she shows pleasure, discomfort and pain.  We will discuss about what she would like to try next time.  It's a great way to practice disclosure and consent, and build anticipation for our next meet.  \n\nIn my experience, 90+% of SBs seem to be open to a D/s relationship with an experienced partner they trust that can \"show them the ropes\" (pun intended lol).",
