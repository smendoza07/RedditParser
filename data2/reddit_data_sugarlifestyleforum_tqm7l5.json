You might get away with it for a while but eventually they will ban.\n\nYep, the site that used to have a Lifestyle Expectation field in the profiles\u2026 in dollar signs. I kid you not. \n\nSA are total hypocrites with their fake virtues. That goes for Brandon Wade too, now spewing his newfound \u201cenlightment\u201d because he apparently didn\u2019t have the guts to restructure his site properly to support the sugar lifestyle that made him very wealthy.\n\nFeeling remorse and need for change Brandon Wade? Just return all of the money to the sugar community. Become a monk free of worldly possessions, then maybe we\u2019ll believe you. \ud83d\ude02",

But, I agree with him, the US phrase is delightful.\n\nThe phrase \"the cat's out of the bag\" means more that a secret has been made known or revealed.  You might say something like \"We were going to have a surprise party for molly but somebody let the cat out of the bag and now she knows about it so it won't be a surprise any more\"\n\nHope this makes sense.",

Escorts generally only reject a customer if they are really disagreeable for some reason, otherwise anyone who will pay the fee is a customer. On the other hand, SBs tend to choose the SDs they will see out of a pool of willing guys based on who they like the most. Basically they treat sugaring in much the same way that they treat dating, with the money as an added incentive to be more open minded and willing to compromise than they would be in conventional dating situations.\n\nThis also leads on to another reason why you shouldn\u2019t compare hourly escort rates with the typical PPM rates for a meeting that will last several hours. SBs pay the financial cost of being choosy about whom they date, and escorts are being financially compensated for not being too picky about whom they see.",

So, if a young woman gets enough to cover her expenses, and still can choose someone her own age and in her own league, frankly she's better off than before, and since she's only covering her expenses, there's no profit and she's unlikely to see herself as escorting. Similarly,  if it's a young guy, getting laid by someone in his own league, he's still financially better off than paying club fees, drinks etc...and he really doesn't see himself as a John if the amount he pays is really something that just covers expenses he otherwise would have given to the club and liquor industry. \n\nNow, maybe some of the women also will do online or fantastically high ppm with older guys, but in reality, they are not looking to do anything but meet up with guys of their own age. \n\nThose of us over 35 who think they are going to get someone out of their league for peanuts are obviously going to be disappointed.",

I\u2019m so sorry to every woman who ends up on there.  I wish all SBs would always do a M&G and not talk details about intimacy until after it.  These guys will msg 100% of the women in a city asking them specific details about their boundaries for sex and then they post responses online for other guys to find girls who match their sexual kinks - and the details do not represent SBs in a flattering light.",

But, I agree with him, the US phrase is delightful.\n\nThe phrase \"the cat's out of the bag\" means more that a secret has been made known or revealed.

Escorts generally only reject a customer if they are really disagreeable for some reason, otherwise anyone who will pay the fee is a customer. On the other hand, SBs tend to choose the SDs they will see out of a pool of willing guys based on who they like the most. Basically they treat sugaring in much the same way that they treat dating, with the money as an added incentive to be more open minded and willing to compromise than they would be in conventional dating situations.\n\nThis also leads on to another reason why you shouldn\u2019t compare hourly escort rates with the typical PPM rates for a meeting that will last several hours. SBs pay the financial cost of being choosy about whom they date, and escorts are being financially compensated for not being too picky about whom they see.",

You can have lots of empty time in your schedule. Getting more customers is smart even if you would be getting less.\n\nTruth most likely is that it's not actually less per fuck, but vastly more.

But, I agree with him, the US phrase is delightful.\n\nThe phrase \"the cat's out of the bag\" means more that a secret has been made known or revealed.  You might say something like \"We were going to have a surprise party for molly but somebody let the cat out of the bag and now she knows about it so it won't be a surprise any more\"\n\nHope this makes sense.",

Escorts generally only reject a customer if they are really disagreeable for some reason, otherwise anyone who will pay the fee is a customer. On the other hand, SBs tend to choose the SDs they will see out of a pool of willing guys based on who they like the most. Basically they treat sugaring in much the same way that they treat dating, with the money as an added incentive to be more open minded and willing to compromise than they would be in conventional dating situations.\n\nThis also leads on to another reason why you shouldn\u2019t compare hourly escort rates with the typical PPM rates for a meeting that will last several hours. SBs pay the financial cost of being choosy about whom they date, and escorts are being financially compensated for not being too picky about whom they see.",

You can have lots of empty time in your schedule. Getting more customers is smart even if you would be getting less.\n\nTruth most likely is that it's not actually less per fuck, but vastly more.

I have no issue with opinions that disagree with mine as I am still interested in seeing other points of view whether they disagree with mine or not. Curiosity. \n\nIn what world does DATE stand for dick at the end though? The definition of a date is a romantic appointment. I don\u2019t engage in intimacy after every date even in the vanilla world. It also shouldn\u2019t be expected out of a woman. Who said you could tell someone what to do with their body just because you did something like pay for a simple date? \n\nIf that\u2019s how you think though, you should make it known from the start to avoid disappointments. \u201cHey, sweetheart, I expect for you to sleep with me after this\u201d would make everything easier.

Escorts generally only reject a customer if they are really disagreeable for some reason, otherwise anyone who will pay the fee is a customer. On the other hand, SBs tend to choose the SDs they will see out of a pool of willing guys based on who they like the most. Basically they treat sugaring in much the same way that they treat dating, with the money as an added incentive to be more open minded and willing to compromise than they would be in conventional dating situations.\n\nThis also leads on to another reason why you shouldn\u2019t compare hourly escort rates with the typical PPM rates for a meeting that will last several hours. SBs pay the financial cost of being choosy about whom they date, and escorts are being financially compensated for not being too picky about whom they see.",

You can have lots of empty time in your schedule. Getting more customers is smart even if you would be getting less.\n\nTruth most likely is that it's not actually less per fuck, but vastly more. It's often less money per hour from that specific guy, but there a shitload of benefits attached to it even if you're an escort. If there wasn't, they wouldn't do it.",
