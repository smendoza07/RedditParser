    "body": "(These are all over the place, take my tips if you\u2019d like, this is what I did, and it worked for me and I hope it works for you too)\n\nFirst things first if a \u201csugar daddy/momma\u201d is trying to get you to send money In order for you to get money immediately back out it\u2019s a scam!!!\n\nSecond: if you\u2019re flying out please do research on where you\u2019re going, have back up money (that they don\u2019t know about) incase things go wrong and always and I mean ALWAYS make to tell at-least three trusted people where you\u2019re going and make sure they have your location. \n\nThird: if you want to get money to you need to look GOOD. Invest in your looks, clothes, shoes, nails toes and hair!! And if you can\u2019t get your nails done because money is tight go to your local dollar store, plain press ons, nail glue and polish will take you a long way. Pair your toes and clean it up with nail polish remover. If you can\u2019t get your hair done at a Solon do it yourself (I looked up hairstyles for girls like me or I do my own box braids or lay a lace (synthetic) it takes a lot to make it look like human hair but whatever it takes to put money in my pockets.\n\nThis is what I have for now. But if you have other tips share them I wouldn\u2019t mind upping my game some more.",

I haven\u2019t gotten my nails done in probably ten years. Though I do give myself pedicures weekly, more for me than anyone else though. I run a small ranch so I work hard and play hard. I\u2019ve had wonderfully successful relationships with city daddies and country daddies. I\u2019ve showed up to dates in heels and I\u2019ve shown up to dates with bruises from wrestling steers. I think it depends on the SB and the SD. With the right fit you don\u2019t have to go out of your way to play a part. You have to be willing to wait longer for the right match but that\u2019s okay. I love your confidence though and 100% agree on safety and having backups in place when traveling to new areas.",

Along the same line breast job-my SDs/earnings in all walks of life tripled after I got mine. Men will do anything for you online and in person\n\n\\-wear nice, simple, classy jewelry: simple diamond earrings and necklace, it comes off classy and sophisticated-and never goes out of style so older men love it\n\n\\-Wear heels. Men always love heels plus everyone will look your way when you click in anywhere.\n\n\\-Wear clothes that show off your waist and hips-form fitting, men go crazy for a slim waist.\n\n\\-Skin care is HUGELY important: buy face wash and moisturizers, night creams. seriously.\n\n\\-Take care of your teeth! I've read so many times people can tell well off people vs non by their teeth. Get them whitened, get invisalign.\n\nI could talk about this for daysssssssssssssssss I love being a woman :)",

When you are being discreet, who do you tell?\n\n3. I love my SB to look good. The better she looks the better we both feel. I feel good when she looks awesome and she feels sexier too. Its a win win. Nails, yeah they are a PITA. To keep them up you need to work on them often. I think special occasions are good for professionally done nails, but most of the time just clean and filed. \n\nHair is another tough one. I dont have to worry about my hair, but damn some of the SBs have a mountain of hair. Long thick silky hair is awesome, but jeez, how long does it take to dry? I would do anything I could to help my SB keep her hair perfect.\n\nMakeup and eyelashes. Ive not met a SB yet that isn't already great at this. And yes I love it.\n\nClothes, ah well this is where Ive learned to back off. My SBs look best in the clothes they pick for themselves.  Sure I might buy something out of the blue that is special, like lingerie or a bodysuit, but my SB always looks best in the clothes shes likes to wear. Then again Im really partial to skirts so Its a good thing she really likes skirts.\n\nTattoos and piercings are very personal. I like them either way.",

He would always pay me weekly even if I didn\u2019t see him. I ended up needing to love out and he paid all my rent upfront and if he\u2019s not in London he flies me out. Within the first few months we made sure to build a lot of trust and respect as well as fairness for one another. He\u2019s now investing in the stock market in four areas for my birthday and helping me start my business next year. I don\u2019t need another sugar daddy as this one pays me more than enough monthly. And whilst everyone can judge what I do. I\u2019m being looked after. I don\u2019t buy expensive. I don\u2019t always get my nails done unless I fly out my daddy don\u2019t care as he appreciates natural looking which is fine. He appreciates everything about me regardless. He\u2019s more in love with my personality while my looks are a bonus. He lets me bring my friends to his villa and pays for any holidays I need if need a break. I couldn\u2019t have asked for anyone better",
