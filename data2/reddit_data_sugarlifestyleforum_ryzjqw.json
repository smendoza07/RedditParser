    "body": "This potential SD I was chatting with asked me how I got into the lifestyle and I told him I was introduced via a friend. He started bragging about dating a ton of different sb\u2019s and hooking up with them, and that he probably knew the friend.(She\u2019s not even on seeking or in this country) \n\nHe asked her name and I gave him a random one. He said she sounded familiar. His words were \u201cIf she\u2019s who I\u2019m thinking of shes not a SB she\u2019s basically a hooker.\u201d I was like\u2026.okay. \ud83d\ude44 He asked if I had a picture of her(like yes but I wouldn\u2019t send it to YOU)- so I pulled a random egirl photo from google and he starts ripping this imaginary woman to shreds telling me how what she\u2019s doing isn\u2019t sugaring and she needs to value herself more and how he definitely slept with her on multiple occasions.\n \nHe asked what I was looking for and I let him know I prefer long term dynamics and gave him what I would expect though after him lying I was no longer interested. He told me it was too high for him so I wished him well in his search. He then proceeded to send me photos of him with various women, most of which he was having some sort sexual encounter with(oral or otherwise) and asked me how much I would charge to just meet with him and have sex with no protection. Finally blocked him after that. I don\u2019t know if those women gave him permission to take those photos even, but a fair amount of them were looking into the camera and looked kind of out of it. I think he preys on desperate women and drug addicts just stay safe out there please guys. \n\nThis all happened last year but another post about sending photos with your face brought it to mind. Just be patient and be PICKY! I did find a Daddy through Seeking that aligned with what i was in search of and we fell in love and are now engaged.",
