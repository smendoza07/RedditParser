Sasuke had already killed Itachi, but it was up in the air whether he would return to the Leaf. Obito twists Sasuke to hating the Leaf by ratting out Danzo; and this pushes Sasuke to attack a Hokage, betray Taka, and fight the members of Team 7. Obito wants to be the only person Sasuke can turn to, the only person Sasuke can rely on to be honest--not necessarily kind or good, but honest; this exact strategy won over Kisame (Obito's greatest and most loyal ally). \n\nObito figures having a minion with sharingan/Rinnegan would be useful. Lots of power, good for dirty work, potential user of the Rinne Rebirth jutsu (to resurrect Madara without Obito dying, if needed). Plus it means more muscle going into the next Great Shinobi War. Remember that White Zetsu were pushovers compared to the resurrected Shinobi Kabuto commanded, and Kabuto could have turned on Obito whenever he wanted. A loyal Sasuke could have been good backup for Obito if he had to confront Kabuto.\n\nEdit: fixed some bad typos and autocorrect errors now that I have access to a proper keyboard.",

Sasuke had already killed Itachi, but it was up in the air whether he would return to the Leaf. Obito twists Sasuke to hating the Leaf by ratting out Danzo; and this pushes Sasuke to attack a Hokage, betray Taka, and fight the members of Team 7. Obito wants to be the only person Sasuke can turn to, the only person Sasuke can rely on to be honest--not necessarily kind or good, but honest; this exact strategy won over Kisame (Obito's greatest and most loyal ally). \n\nObito figures having a minion with sharingan/Rinnegan would be useful. Lots of power, good for dirty work, potential user of the Rinne Rebirth jutsu (to resurrect Madara without Obito dying, if needed). Plus it means more muscle going into the next Great Shinobi War. Remember that White Zetsu were pushovers compared to the resurrected Shinobi Kabuto commanded, and Kabuto could have turned on Obito whenever he wanted. A loyal Sasuke could have been good backup for Obito if he had to confront Kabuto.\n\nEdit: fixed some bad typos and autocorrect errors now that I have access to a proper keyboard.",

Sasuke had already killed Itachi, but it was up in the air whether he would return to the Leaf. Obito twists Sasuke to hating the Leaf by ratting out Danzo; and this pushes Sasuke to attack a Hokage, betray Taka, and fight the members of Team 7. Obito wants to be the only person Sasuke can turn to, the only person Sasuke can rely on to be honest--not necessarily kind or good, but honest; this exact strategy won over Kisame (Obito's greatest and most loyal ally). \n\nObito figures having a minion with sharingan/Rinnegan would be useful. Lots of power, good for dirty work, potential user of the Rinne Rebirth jutsu (to resurrect Madara without Obito dying, if needed). Plus it means more muscle going into the next Great Shinobi War. Remember that White Zetsu were pushovers compared to the resurrected Shinobi Kabuto commanded, and Kabuto could have turned on Obito whenever he wanted. A loyal Sasuke could have been good backup for Obito if he had to confront Kabuto.\n\nEdit: fixed some bad typos and autocorrect errors now that I have access to a proper keyboard.",

Sasuke had already killed Itachi, but it was up in the air whether he would return to the Leaf. Obito twists Sasuke to hating the Leaf by ratting out Danzo; and this pushes Sasuke to attack a Hokage, betray Taka, and fight the members of Team 7. Obito wants to be the only person Sasuke can turn to, the only person Sasuke can rely on to be honest--not necessarily kind or good, but honest; this exact strategy won over Kisame (Obito's greatest and most loyal ally). \n\nObito figures having a minion with sharingan/Rinnegan would be useful. Lots of power, good for dirty work, potential user of the Rinne Rebirth jutsu (to resurrect Madara without Obito dying, if needed). Plus it means more muscle going into the next Great Shinobi War. Remember that White Zetsu were pushovers compared to the resurrected Shinobi Kabuto commanded, and Kabuto could have turned on Obito whenever he wanted. A loyal Sasuke could have been good backup for Obito if he had to confront Kabuto.\n\nEdit: fixed some bad typos and autocorrect errors now that I have access to a proper keyboard.",

Sasuke had already killed Itachi, but it was up in the air whether he would return to the Leaf. Obito twists Sasuke to hating the Leaf by ratting out Danzo; and this pushes Sasuke to attack a Hokage, betray Taka, and fight the members of Team 7. Obito wants to be the only person Sasuke can turn to, the only person Sasuke can rely on to be honest--not necessarily kind or good, but honest; this exact strategy won over Kisame (Obito's greatest and most loyal ally). \n\nObito figures having a minion with sharingan/Rinnegan would be useful. Lots of power, good for dirty work, potential user of the Rinne Rebirth jutsu (to resurrect Madara without Obito dying, if needed). Plus it means more muscle going into the next Great Shinobi War. Remember that White Zetsu were pushovers compared to the resurrected Shinobi Kabuto commanded, and Kabuto could have turned on Obito whenever he wanted. A loyal Sasuke could have been good backup for Obito if he had to confront Kabuto.\n\nEdit: fixed some bad typos and autocorrect errors now that I have access to a proper keyboard.",
