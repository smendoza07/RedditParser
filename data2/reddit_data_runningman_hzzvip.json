Every each of them has their own character to show us. Must be different to show its variety right ? And also i see that JSJ is intelligent . He might be weak phisically but usually when it comes to quizzle or games doesnt involve phisical he shows his functional in the team. And he is also hilarious on his own way by being mean, witty and petty. Well elder people usually like that . Right ? Btw just 2 cents of my opinion \ud83d\ude49\u270c\ud83c\udffb",
