    "body": "Last night I was a bit bored and decided to check out some SD profiles in my area on SA.  It\u2019s usually good for some entertainment at the very least. I stumbled on a brand new profile where the gentleman had a very nice picture but his full name showing on some kind of access pass he was wearing. I couldn\u2019t just let that go knowing he\u2019s risking his identity. I messaged him with a quick heads up that he should rethink the picture or crop it. I didn\u2019t say anything more than that as he was near my age and I haven\u2019t received great responses from men in that age bracket. I\u2019m not delusional and understand the appeal of the age gap and wanting younger women. I left it go knowing I tried to help and that the rest was on him. This morning I found a sweet and very grateful message from him asking to meet up for drinks! So just like that I have a meet and greet I wasn\u2019t expecting! \n\nFor the record, he did indeed change his picture!",

            "body": "Great story! Somewhat related, an SB reached out to me a few weeks ago who was above my age range. She's mid-30s, I'm early 40s and normally filter at mid-late 20s.\n\nShe was very private, no profile pic, but shared her private ones. Attractive and we had a nice, albeit slow conversation. She didn't want to leave SA before a M&G, so I played along. She cancelled our first M&G, with some notice, but overall started to feel like a toe dipper or who knows what.\n\nAnyway, we met this morning, I had low expectations. She blew me away. Beautiful, very fit, a fun conversation and we came to agreeable financial terms as well. \n\nJust goes to show that 1% of the time, SA can surprise on the upside.",
