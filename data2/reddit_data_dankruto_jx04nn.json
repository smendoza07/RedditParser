The force of the air palm would have had to be much, much greater than the force of the giant splinter being launched from a five hundred foot tall super being. It also would have to have been timed *perfectly*, meaning no room for error. The show makes it look like it takes forever, because it\u2019s an animation based off of manga panels, but in actuality it\u2019s a few seconds at most. \n\nIf Neji misses, or doesn\u2019t have the force required to push it off target enough, then Hinata and Naruto are probably both dead. \n\nBut...\n\nHinata could have just fucking pushed Naruto out of the god damned way.",

Same for other prominent characters that received the same treatment. Also, and this is very important, every character's demise may seem meaningless but it does deliver a meaningful and impactful message about the world the story is taking place in.\n\nAnko's whole purpose was to be used by Sasuke to revive Orochimaru, and that's it.

Konoha would be less intimate of a place if it was just \"random guard 1 who only exists in episode 23\" or \"random guard 7, made with the Random Guard Generator Animation Template.\" They did that with the Uchiha clan, and I have a very hard time caring who any of the Uchiha are except for the ones explicitly named, and Sasuke's story is weaker for it. We'd only see those dudes once, and they'd have a lazy, generic look.  Instead, we have Coughing Dude, Chunin Exam Girl, and Bandage Nose-Guy, who all have names, back stories, motivations, and recognizable features. They show up repeatedly so that we become accustomed to them and even begin to like them or get attached to them. And ATTACHMENT is a major theme of Naruto. Protecting Konoha is a major plot point and motivation of the main character; it would be harder for us as an audience to empathize with that if everyone in Konoha was a nameless nobody.\n\nInstead of just some rando buying groceries while Naruto gives a big speech about Dattebayo, we see a character with a name, who we recognize; it makes the world seem more real and lived in, and acts as a small Easter egg for fans of that character.",

The force of the air palm would have had to be much, much greater than the force of the giant splinter being launched from a five hundred foot tall super being. It also would have to have been timed *perfectly*, meaning no room for error. The show makes it look like it takes forever, because it\u2019s an animation based off of manga panels, but in actuality it\u2019s a few seconds at most. \n\nIf Neji misses, or doesn\u2019t have the force required to push it off target enough, then Hinata and Naruto are probably both dead. \n\nBut...\n\nHinata could have just fucking pushed Naruto out of the god damned way.",

Your character must have a role in the story despite how glorious or inglorious that role might end up being.\n\nLet's use ASOIAF/GOT since you brought it up. Ned Stark had a narrative purpose, and even if he was >!unceremoniously killed off!< he achieved his purpose in the story by triggering a chain of events that helped the author's narrative grow. Same for other prominent characters that received the same treatment. Also, and this is very important, every character's demise may seem meaningless but it does deliver a meaningful and impactful message about the world the story is taking place in.\n\nAnko's whole purpose was to be used by Sasuke to revive Orochimaru, and that's it. No message, meaning or purpose behind her character thematically or narratively.",

Konoha would be less intimate of a place if it was just \"random guard 1 who only exists in episode 23\" or \"random guard 7, made with the Random Guard Generator Animation Template.\" They did that with the Uchiha clan, and I have a very hard time caring who any of the Uchiha are except for the ones explicitly named, and Sasuke's story is weaker for it. We'd only see those dudes once, and they'd have a lazy, generic look.  Instead, we have Coughing Dude, Chunin Exam Girl, and Bandage Nose-Guy, who all have names, back stories, motivations, and recognizable features. They show up repeatedly so that we become accustomed to them and even begin to like them or get attached to them. And ATTACHMENT is a major theme of Naruto. Protecting Konoha is a major plot point and motivation of the main character; it would be harder for us as an audience to empathize with that if everyone in Konoha was a nameless nobody.\n\nInstead of just some rando buying groceries while Naruto gives a big speech about Dattebayo, we see a character with a name, who we recognize; it makes the world seem more real and lived in, and acts as a small Easter egg for fans of that character.",

The show makes it look like it takes forever, because it\u2019s an animation based off of manga panels, but in actuality it\u2019s a few seconds at most. \n\nIf Neji misses, or doesn\u2019t have the force required to push it off target enough, then Hinata and Naruto are probably both dead. \n\nBut...\n\nHinata could have just fucking pushed Naruto out of the god damned way.",

Konoha would be less intimate of a place if it was just \"random guard 1 who only exists in episode 23\" or \"random guard 7, made with the Random Guard Generator Animation Template.\" They did that with the Uchiha clan, and I have a very hard time caring who any of the Uchiha are except for the ones explicitly named, and Sasuke's story is weaker for it. We'd only see those dudes once, and they'd have a lazy, generic look.  Instead, we have Coughing Dude, Chunin Exam Girl, and Bandage Nose-Guy, who all have names, back stories, motivations, and recognizable features. They show up repeatedly so that we become accustomed to them and even begin to like them or get attached to them. And ATTACHMENT is a major theme of Naruto. Protecting Konoha is a major plot point and motivation of the main character; it would be harder for us as an audience to empathize with that if everyone in Konoha was a nameless nobody.\n\nInstead of just some rando buying groceries while Naruto gives a big speech about Dattebayo, we see a character with a name, who we recognize; it makes the world seem more real and lived in, and acts as a small Easter egg for fans of that character.",

Your character must have a role in the story despite how glorious or inglorious that role might end up being.\n\nLet's use ASOIAF/GOT since you brought it up. Ned Stark had a narrative purpose, and even if he was >!unceremoniously killed off!< he achieved his purpose in the story by triggering a chain of events that helped the author's narrative grow. Same for other prominent characters that received the same treatment. Also, and this is very important, every character's demise may seem meaningless but it does deliver a meaningful and impactful message about the world the story is taking place in.\n\nAnko's whole purpose was to be used by Sasuke to revive Orochimaru, and that's it. No message, meaning or purpose behind her character thematically or narratively.",

Konoha would be less intimate of a place if it was just \"random guard 1 who only exists in episode 23\" or \"random guard 7, made with the Random Guard Generator Animation Template.\" They did that with the Uchiha clan, and I have a very hard time caring who any of the Uchiha are except for the ones explicitly named, and Sasuke's story is weaker for it. We'd only see those dudes once, and they'd have a lazy, generic look.  Instead, we have Coughing Dude, Chunin Exam Girl, and Bandage Nose-Guy, who all have names, back stories, motivations, and recognizable features. They show up repeatedly so that we become accustomed to them and even begin to like them or get attached to them. And ATTACHMENT is a major theme of Naruto. Protecting Konoha is a major plot point and motivation of the main character; it would be harder for us as an audience to empathize with that if everyone in Konoha was a nameless nobody.\n\nInstead of just some rando buying groceries while Naruto gives a big speech about Dattebayo, we see a character with a name, who we recognize; it makes the world seem more real and lived in, and acts as a small Easter egg for fans of that character.",

Your character must have a role in the story despite how glorious or inglorious that role might end up being.\n\nLet's use ASOIAF/GOT since you brought it up. Ned Stark had a narrative purpose, and even if he was >!unceremoniously killed off!< he achieved his purpose in the story by triggering a chain of events that helped the author's narrative grow. Same for other prominent characters that received the same treatment. Also, and this is very important, every character's demise may seem meaningless but it does deliver a meaningful and impactful message about the world the story is taking place in.\n\nAnko's whole purpose was to be used by Sasuke to revive Orochimaru, and that's it. No message, meaning or purpose behind her character thematically or narratively.",

Konoha would be less intimate of a place if it was just \"random guard 1 who only exists in episode 23\" or \"random guard 7, made with the Random Guard Generator Animation Template.\" They did that with the Uchiha clan, and I have a very hard time caring who any of the Uchiha are except for the ones explicitly named, and Sasuke's story is weaker for it. We'd only see those dudes once, and they'd have a lazy, generic look.  Instead, we have Coughing Dude, Chunin Exam Girl, and Bandage Nose-Guy, who all have names, back stories, motivations, and recognizable features. They show up repeatedly so that we become accustomed to them and even begin to like them or get attached to them. And ATTACHMENT is a major theme of Naruto. Protecting Konoha is a major plot point and motivation of the main character; it would be harder for us as an audience to empathize with that if everyone in Konoha was a nameless nobody.\n\nInstead of just some rando buying groceries while Naruto gives a big speech about Dattebayo, we see a character with a name, who we recognize; it makes the world seem more real and lived in, and acts as a small Easter egg for fans of that character.",

Ned Stark had a narrative purpose, and even if he was >!unceremoniously killed off!< he achieved his purpose in the story by triggering a chain of events that helped the author's narrative grow. Same for other prominent characters that received the same treatment. Also, and this is very important, every character's demise may seem meaningless but it does deliver a meaningful and impactful message about the world the story is taking place in.\n\nAnko's whole purpose was to be used by Sasuke to revive Orochimaru, and that's it. No message, meaning or purpose behind her character thematically or narratively.",

Konoha would be less intimate of a place if it was just \"random guard 1 who only exists in episode 23\" or \"random guard 7, made with the Random Guard Generator Animation Template.\" They did that with the Uchiha clan, and I have a very hard time caring who any of the Uchiha are except for the ones explicitly named, and Sasuke's story is weaker for it. We'd only see those dudes once, and they'd have a lazy, generic look.  Instead, we have Coughing Dude, Chunin Exam Girl, and Bandage Nose-Guy, who all have names, back stories, motivations, and recognizable features. They show up repeatedly so that we become accustomed to them and even begin to like them or get attached to them. And ATTACHMENT is a major theme of Naruto. Protecting Konoha is a major plot point and motivation of the main character; it would be harder for us as an audience to empathize with that if everyone in Konoha was a nameless nobody.\n\nInstead of just some rando buying groceries while Naruto gives a big speech about Dattebayo, we see a character with a name, who we recognize; it makes the world seem more real and lived in, and acts as a small Easter egg for fans of that character.",

Konoha would be less intimate of a place if it was just \"random guard 1 who only exists in episode 23\" or \"random guard 7, made with the Random Guard Generator Animation Template.\" They did that with the Uchiha clan, and I have a very hard time caring who any of the Uchiha are except for the ones explicitly named, and Sasuke's story is weaker for it. We'd only see those dudes once, and they'd have a lazy, generic look.  Instead, we have Coughing Dude, Chunin Exam Girl, and Bandage Nose-Guy, who all have names, back stories, motivations, and recognizable features. They show up repeatedly so that we become accustomed to them and even begin to like them or get attached to them. And ATTACHMENT is a major theme of Naruto. Protecting Konoha is a major plot point and motivation of the main character; it would be harder for us as an audience to empathize with that if everyone in Konoha was a nameless nobody.\n\nInstead of just some rando buying groceries while Naruto gives a big speech about Dattebayo, we see a character with a name, who we recognize; it makes the world seem more real and lived in, and acts as a small Easter egg for fans of that character.",
