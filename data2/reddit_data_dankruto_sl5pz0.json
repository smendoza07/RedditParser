It\u2019s not heart breaking when krillin dies to king piccolo and the dragon balls aren\u2019t available. It\u2019s not triumphant when goku wins against king piccolo and piccolo jr. having the main character die is also something for the fans at the start of dbz. No strategy vs vegeta, the spirit bomb always works on destroying the Bad guys like freeza and boo. There is nothing in dbz to which the fan base can cling to it\u2019s just bing explosions and destroying wastelands. Dbz is trash and wouldn\u2019t never get 2 sequels like idk GT and super. \n\nThere was and has been strategic maneuvers in dbz, to say otherwise is just to hate on something popular. Things in that world have reason. Instant teleportation, time travel, fusions, afterlife, all have reason to them. Is the main race in the show kinda bullshit compared to a regular human? Yeah but that\u2019s established in chapter one of the dragonball, dude has a tail. \n\nThe only way we are going to get more Naruto content is boruto. Is it kinda wack right now? Yeah, was the time skip at the beginning kinda wack too? Yeah, but it\u2019s this or nothing. I think it\u2019s good enough. I much prefer to read the work then watch it. Years ago when Naruto was on tv like the original series I remember that it was kinda dumb. But now I have 40+ books of the series. Boruto could get better. If we give it a chance.",

Remember that the tale of Izanami and Izanagi is basically the same tale as Orpheus and Eurydice.\n\nIt would've both fucked up with Kabuto's genetic modifications by reversing their effects AND liberate him from the reincarnation jutsu, while remaining coherent with the Shinto Goddess' theme.",

This led to even Sasuke in the future defecting causing them to lose another top rank asset for a few years. \n\nItachi realised that his actions were completely futile later on and there could have been better ways to stop the coup.

If the clan learns of this, they would desire even more.\"\n\nHe then turns his MS to his own son, Itachi and says \"WATCH!\":\n\nThree Uchiha clansmen are outside a Sh\u014dji and it opens.\n\nOne says \"We have brought the Jinchuriki! (Naruto wrapped up in ropes). They throw him on the mat.\n\n\"Let's do it! The captain can do it! Captain! Do it (please!). Use the power of the Uchiha!\"\n\nFugaku stands there decisive. Instead of destroying Naruto (as the Jinchuriki) he unleashes his MS and wherever they are the building explodes.\n\nUnrelenting, Kurama is destroying the city (something that was shown). The three that brought him there were destroyed.\n\nOne stands atop a gate at the city: Fugaku Uchiha.\n\nBack to reality.\n\nOnly one kneels before Fugaku. That is Itachi.\n\nFugaku Uchiha: \"Many in the clan resent the Village. When you're pushed into a corner, you'll resort to things like this. There will be much bloodshed on both sides.\"\n\n\"But Itachi... If you are with me... We can take them by surprise and restrain the higher-ups.\" he proposes. \"Some fighting will ensue, but with your help as an ANBU, a bloodless revolution can happen!\"\n\n\"A bloodless revolution?!\" Itachi wonders... in disbelief.\n\n\"Itachi, you are my son. Please!\" Fugaku implores. \"Save our clan!\"\n\n******************\n\nWhy does this tell us? Itachi, for some reason, chose to slaughter babies and kids instead of killing Danzo and the Third. Itachi protected the same leaders that hated his clan and wanted to genocide it. Itachi killed innocent people instead because their parents and husbands wanted to fight for equal rights. None of this makes sense with Itachi's character.",

He slaughtered a bunch of women and children instead of even entertaining the idea that this whole thing could be resolved with no innocent lives lost. He could've at least tried for the bloodless route instead of saying \"no, that won't work\" and killing a bunch of people anyways.\n\nLike, what was the worst case scenario? He attempts the takeover with his dad. They lose. The Leaf slaughters the Uchicha anyway. Best case scenario? The Uchicha take control of the village and innocent people don't die. The only downside for Itachi is that if they lose, Sasuke dies too, but 7 year-old Sasuke also isn't worth the entire clan's lives combined.",

The reason people blame Danzo is because he purposely interfered in the efforts to stop the coup without killing them, which means that he is directly responsible (and intentionally so) for the massacre. Shisui was to handle the situation and he would've done so far more efficiently with much less risk or bloodshed than Itachi could ever manage. Danzo is responsible for his death, and managed to take one of his eyes. Itachi was 14. A literal child. Just one year older than the Konoha 12 genin are in part 1. Danzo was the adult manipulating him and intentionally forcing him into a situation where he had to choose between the wellbeing of the clan or the overall village. And he chose the village. Were there other options, or ways he could've gone about it that didn't involve killing everyone? Yea probably. But being a literal child, manipulated by a cunning and disgustingly self-centered man, even if he had realized one of those options and attempted it Danzo would've just had him killed too. And then taken his eyes for good measure. And do you really want Danzo having access to both Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi, not to mention amaterasu? No! That would be bad. Itachi did his best given that he was a child forced into a horrific situation, backed frantically into a corner and given a hellish choice. Nobody among us, as 14 year olds, would've fared any better than he did. Critics and fans alike would've probably screwed up even worse than him",

Itachi was strong af, but I don't think he surpassed Shisui instantly upon getting the mangekyo. And Shisui could only manage to escape Danzo. It's the whole backup thing that matters the most, because as strong as Itachi is the Anbu tend to not be fodder in situations like these. Having them backing up Danzo is a problem.",

The Uchiha clan consisted of a few hundred people at most. The Hidden Leaf Village is several times larger. The fear with the coup was that it would destabilize the Hidden Leaf, making it vulnerable to attack from the outside. It would've ultimately been destroyed by foreign powers such as the Land of Lightning which at that time was still hostile to the Land of Fire and by proxy the Hidden Leaf. Same goes for the Land of Water and the Hidden Mist. They would've torn the Leaf apart.

I think an alternative could have been found and that level of insurrection probably wasn't needed. Why not just kill the leader of the coup instead of the entire village? You know there had to be one, and if Itachi and Obito were clearly strong enough to take out the entire Uchiha clan why not just use their power as a fear tactic in order to lead the clan under their agenda and keep them in line? Or they could've idk talked it out and compromised lol. Killing the entire village was the easiest route in my opinion. Why try to lead your people in the right direction when you can just off them and completely get rid of the problem? I think this whole idea that the coup was inevitable is cap, especially when you have an insider like Itachi who could give Konoha a heads up there's no way that the coup couldn't have been thwarted in another way. Konoha clearly had the advantage but got rid of the Uchiha clan like some loose threads.",

There's many ways to create a tragic back story in a world where your job is to kill or be killed.

I'm sure Kishimoto had a thousand different compelling ideas of how the story surrounding the Uchiha could have gone. There's no need to be close-minded just because that's the way the story turned out.

He prevented the village from falling into a civil war with plenty of deaths, certainly also from assaults from other villages taking the opportunity from the civil war, etc. He also sacrificed his own honour to be hated by everyone he knew while making a deal with the akatsuki to protect Konoha. And since he perfectly knew his massacre was immoral, he wanted to punish himself and avenge his clan by wanting Sasuke kill himself (Itachi). I'm pretty sure all of this deserves some appreciation for such a kid. \n\nMeanwhile hideous worst piece of human garbage villains like Madara, Nagato and Obito are being glorified after doing worse and unjustified atrocities.",

The anime is what fleshed out and made Kawaki which was also thanks to that aspect.\n\n\nThink about it....what if Boruto didn't exist?\ud83d\ude44\n\n2021 Boruto carried shounen easily yet it's claimed to be trash....

It\u2019s not heart breaking when krillin dies to king piccolo and the dragon balls aren\u2019t available. It\u2019s not triumphant when goku wins against king piccolo and piccolo jr. having the main character die is also something for the fans at the start of dbz. No strategy vs vegeta, the spirit bomb always works on destroying the Bad guys like freeza and boo. There is nothing in dbz to which the fan base can cling to it\u2019s just bing explosions and destroying wastelands. Dbz is trash and wouldn\u2019t never get 2 sequels like idk GT and super. \n\nThere was and has been strategic maneuvers in dbz, to say otherwise is just to hate on something popular. Things in that world have reason. Instant teleportation, time travel, fusions, afterlife, all have reason to them. Is the main race in the show kinda bullshit compared to a regular human? Yeah but that\u2019s established in chapter one of the dragonball, dude has a tail. \n\nThe only way we are going to get more Naruto content is boruto. Is it kinda wack right now? Yeah, was the time skip at the beginning kinda wack too? Yeah, but it\u2019s this or nothing. I think it\u2019s good enough. I much prefer to read the work then watch it. Years ago when Naruto was on tv like the original series I remember that it was kinda dumb. But now I have 40+ books of the series. Boruto could get better. If we give it a chance.",

Izanami is cool and I love that battle, but it just doesn't make sense.\n\nIMO it would've been more fitting to Japanese folklore if Izanami was related to death, it should've been a genjutsu that, instead of using time loops, blurred the line between life and death, either by making lethal attacks miss or by reversing the effect of life-related techniques. Remember that the tale of Izanami and Izanagi is basically the same tale as Orpheus and Eurydice.\n\nIt would've both fucked up with Kabuto's genetic modifications by reversing their effects AND liberate him from the reincarnation jutsu, while remaining coherent with the Shinto Goddess' theme.",

The three that brought him there were destroyed.\n\nOne stands atop a gate at the city: Fugaku Uchiha.\n\nBack to reality.\n\nOnly one kneels before Fugaku. That is Itachi.\n\nFugaku Uchiha: \"Many in the clan resent the Village. When you're pushed into a corner, you'll resort to things like this. There will be much bloodshed on both sides.\"\n\n\"But Itachi... If you are with me... We can take them by surprise and restrain the higher-ups.\" he proposes. \"Some fighting will ensue, but with your help as an ANBU, a bloodless revolution can happen!\"\n\n\"A bloodless revolution?!\" Itachi wonders... in disbelief.\n\n\"Itachi, you are my son. Please!\" Fugaku implores. \"Save our clan!\"\n\n******************\n\nWhy does this tell us? Itachi, for some reason, chose to slaughter babies and kids instead of killing Danzo and the Third. Itachi protected the same leaders that hated his clan and wanted to genocide it. Itachi killed innocent people instead because their parents and husbands wanted to fight for equal rights. None of this makes sense with Itachi's character.",

He slaughtered a bunch of women and children instead of even entertaining the idea that this whole thing could be resolved with no innocent lives lost. He could've at least tried for the bloodless route instead of saying \"no, that won't work\" and killing a bunch of people anyways.\n\nLike, what was the worst case scenario? He attempts the takeover with his dad. They lose. The Leaf slaughters the Uchicha anyway. Best case scenario? The Uchicha take control of the village and innocent people don't die. The only downside for Itachi is that if they lose, Sasuke dies too, but 7 year-old Sasuke also isn't worth the entire clan's lives combined.",

The reason people blame Danzo is because he purposely interfered in the efforts to stop the coup without killing them, which means that he is directly responsible (and intentionally so) for the massacre. Shisui was to handle the situation and he would've done so far more efficiently with much less risk or bloodshed than Itachi could ever manage. Danzo is responsible for his death, and managed to take one of his eyes. Itachi was 14. A literal child. Just one year older than the Konoha 12 genin are in part 1. Danzo was the adult manipulating him and intentionally forcing him into a situation where he had to choose between the wellbeing of the clan or the overall village. And he chose the village. Were there other options, or ways he could've gone about it that didn't involve killing everyone? Yea probably. But being a literal child, manipulated by a cunning and disgustingly self-centered man, even if he had realized one of those options and attempted it Danzo would've just had him killed too. And then taken his eyes for good measure. And do you really want Danzo having access to both Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi, not to mention amaterasu? No! That would be bad. Itachi did his best given that he was a child forced into a horrific situation, backed frantically into a corner and given a hellish choice. Nobody among us, as 14 year olds, would've fared any better than he did. Critics and fans alike would've probably screwed up even worse than him",

The Uchiha clan consisted of a few hundred people at most. The Hidden Leaf Village is several times larger. The fear with the coup was that it would destabilize the Hidden Leaf, making it vulnerable to attack from the outside. It would've ultimately been destroyed by foreign powers such as the Land of Lightning which at that time was still hostile to the Land of Fire and by proxy the Hidden Leaf. Same goes for the Land of Water and the Hidden Mist. They would've torn the Leaf apart.

I think an alternative could have been found and that level of insurrection probably wasn't needed. Why not just kill the leader of the coup instead of the entire village?

Or they could've idk talked it out and compromised lol. Killing the entire village was the easiest route in my opinion. Why try to lead your people in the right direction when you can just off them and completely get rid of the problem? I think this whole idea that the coup was inevitable is cap, especially when you have an insider like Itachi who could give Konoha a heads up there's no way that the coup couldn't have been thwarted in another way. Konoha clearly had the advantage but got rid of the Uchiha clan like some loose threads.",

The show calls out this type of reasoning again and again but some fans will always want to play realpolitik.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Why the children would be discriminated against? What kinda question is that? Naruto is looked down upon and discriminated against because in thier eyes, he is related to a tragedy (death of lord fourth) and he might become a threat to the village (being the vessel for a monster which can reduce landscapes into ashes) they will see the surving uchiha children with the same gaze as they see naruto.\n\nWhy? Naruto had a Kaiju demon living inside of him and Jinchuriki are discriminated, that's just the norm. \nThe Uchiha children are completely blameless, why would most people discriminate them?\n\n\n\n\n\n>And Itachi would've succeeded in breaking the wheel it wasn't for kabuto. The moment Naruto saw assume, kotoamatsukami would've been activated and sasuke would have the urge to protect the village.\n\n\nUntil the jutsu was broken. That's some way of breaking the wheel by commiting genocide, becoming a terrorist and literally mind control those who dissent with you.",

It\u2019s not heart breaking when krillin dies to king piccolo and the dragon balls aren\u2019t available. It\u2019s not triumphant when goku wins against king piccolo and piccolo jr. having the main character die is also something for the fans at the start of dbz. No strategy vs vegeta, the spirit bomb always works on destroying the Bad guys like freeza and boo. There is nothing in dbz to which the fan base can cling to it\u2019s just bing explosions and destroying wastelands. Dbz is trash and wouldn\u2019t never get 2 sequels like idk GT and super. \n\nThere was and has been strategic maneuvers in dbz, to say otherwise is just to hate on something popular. Things in that world have reason. Instant teleportation, time travel, fusions, afterlife, all have reason to them. Is the main race in the show kinda bullshit compared to a regular human? Yeah but that\u2019s established in chapter one of the dragonball, dude has a tail. \n\nThe only way we are going to get more Naruto content is boruto. Is it kinda wack right now? Yeah, was the time skip at the beginning kinda wack too? Yeah, but it\u2019s this or nothing. I think it\u2019s good enough. I much prefer to read the work then watch it. Years ago when Naruto was on tv like the original series I remember that it was kinda dumb. But now I have 40+ books of the series. Boruto could get better. If we give it a chance.",

Izanami is cool and I love that battle, but it just doesn't make sense.\n\nIMO it would've been more fitting to Japanese folklore if Izanami was related to death, it should've been a genjutsu that, instead of using time loops, blurred the line between life and death, either by making lethal attacks miss or by reversing the effect of life-related techniques. Remember that the tale of Izanami and Izanagi is basically the same tale as Orpheus and Eurydice.\n\nIt would've both fucked up with Kabuto's genetic modifications by reversing their effects AND liberate him from the reincarnation jutsu, while remaining coherent with the Shinto Goddess' theme.",

This led to even Sasuke in the future defecting causing them to lose another top rank asset for a few years. \n\nItachi realised that his actions were completely futile later on and there could have been better ways to stop the coup.

He's saying that this is the sentiment of most Uchiha and if they knew about his power they would beg him to do it.\n\nHe's saying that instead of that, he and Itachi could team up and do the whole takeover bloodlessly. \n\nEven if Itachi didn't believe a bloodless revolution was possible, he went and took the extremely bloody route anyways. He slaughtered a bunch of women and children instead of even entertaining the idea that this whole thing could be resolved with no innocent lives lost. He could've at least tried for the bloodless route instead of saying \"no, that won't work\" and killing a bunch of people anyways.\n\nLike, what was the worst case scenario? He attempts the takeover with his dad. They lose. The Leaf slaughters the Uchicha anyway. Best case scenario? The Uchicha take control of the village and innocent people don't die. The only downside for Itachi is that if they lose, Sasuke dies too, but 7 year-old Sasuke also isn't worth the entire clan's lives combined.",

The reason people blame Danzo is because he purposely interfered in the efforts to stop the coup without killing them, which means that he is directly responsible (and intentionally so) for the massacre. Shisui was to handle the situation and he would've done so far more efficiently with much less risk or bloodshed than Itachi could ever manage. Danzo is responsible for his death, and managed to take one of his eyes. Itachi was 14. A literal child. Just one year older than the Konoha 12 genin are in part 1. Danzo was the adult manipulating him and intentionally forcing him into a situation where he had to choose between the wellbeing of the clan or the overall village. And he chose the village. Were there other options, or ways he could've gone about it that didn't involve killing everyone? Yea probably. But being a literal child, manipulated by a cunning and disgustingly self-centered man, even if he had realized one of those options and attempted it Danzo would've just had him killed too. And then taken his eyes for good measure. And do you really want Danzo having access to both Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi, not to mention amaterasu? No! That would be bad. Itachi did his best given that he was a child forced into a horrific situation, backed frantically into a corner and given a hellish choice. Nobody among us, as 14 year olds, would've fared any better than he did. Critics and fans alike would've probably screwed up even worse than him",

The Uchiha clan consisted of a few hundred people at most. The Hidden Leaf Village is several times larger. The fear with the coup was that it would destabilize the Hidden Leaf, making it vulnerable to attack from the outside. It would've ultimately been destroyed by foreign powers such as the Land of Lightning which at that time was still hostile to the Land of Fire and by proxy the Hidden Leaf. Same goes for the Land of Water and the Hidden Mist. They would've torn the Leaf apart.

I think an alternative could have been found and that level of insurrection probably wasn't needed. Why not just kill the leader of the coup instead of the entire village? You know there had to be one, and if Itachi and Obito were clearly strong enough to take out the entire Uchiha clan why not just use their power as a fear tactic in order to lead the clan under their agenda and keep them in line? Or they could've idk talked it out and compromised lol. Killing the entire village was the easiest route in my opinion. Why try to lead your people in the right direction when you can just off them and completely get rid of the problem? I think this whole idea that the coup was inevitable is cap, especially when you have an insider like Itachi who could give Konoha a heads up there's no way that the coup couldn't have been thwarted in another way. Konoha clearly had the advantage but got rid of the Uchiha clan like some loose threads.",

This could be equally as compelling if not more because some people would respect Itachi for his decision and others in the village would talk shit about him, and Sasuke as his brother would be faced with a more conflicted view of his brother rather than the one-sided hatred he had for most of the story, and then you could also see the political divide in the clan along with Sasuke's complicated feelings on the entire issue.

There's many ways to create a tragic back story in a world where your job is to kill or be killed. I obviously get why Kishimoto did what he did, but to say he needed to do it in order to make the story interesting is an overstatement. I'm sure Kishimoto had a thousand different compelling ideas of how the story surrounding the Uchiha could have gone. There's no need to be close-minded just because that's the way the story turned out. In reality a story has a multitude of directions it could go.You just have to be creative enough to see the possibilities.",

But it would be close fight and a lot of people will die.\n\nNow we're talking about ninjas here, do you seriously think after the clan lost that they are going to let the children live? Even if they did it will only stem more problems since those children will be treated the same way Naruto is treated and unlike our MC not everyone can deal with the type of subjugation\n\nAnd we're talking about people who gain, power from feeling strong emotions especially hatered.

Samurai 7, failed so Kishi at least has Boruto to fall back on and it's working I guess.\n\nIt's better that Boruto is a thing imo.\n\nBlack clover and my hero are just horrible rehash clones of Naruto.\n\nBoruto at least is doing something new and is a unique shounen which the slice of life aspect is cool. The anime is what fleshed out and made Kawaki which was also thanks to that aspect.\n\n\nThink about it....what if Boruto didn't exist?\ud83d\ude44\n\n2021 Boruto carried shounen easily yet it's claimed to be trash....

It\u2019s not triumphant when goku wins against king piccolo and piccolo jr. having the main character die is also something for the fans at the start of dbz. No strategy vs vegeta, the spirit bomb always works on destroying the Bad guys like freeza and boo. There is nothing in dbz to which the fan base can cling to it\u2019s just bing explosions and destroying wastelands. Dbz is trash and wouldn\u2019t never get 2 sequels like idk GT and super. \n\nThere was and has been strategic maneuvers in dbz, to say otherwise is just to hate on something popular. Things in that world have reason. Instant teleportation, time travel, fusions, afterlife, all have reason to them. Is the main race in the show kinda bullshit compared to a regular human? Yeah but that\u2019s established in chapter one of the dragonball, dude has a tail. \n\nThe only way we are going to get more Naruto content is boruto. Is it kinda wack right now? Yeah, was the time skip at the beginning kinda wack too? Yeah, but it\u2019s this or nothing. I think it\u2019s good enough. I much prefer to read the work then watch it. Years ago when Naruto was on tv like the original series I remember that it was kinda dumb. But now I have 40+ books of the series. Boruto could get better. If we give it a chance.",

Remember that the tale of Izanami and Izanagi is basically the same tale as Orpheus and Eurydice.\n\nIt would've both fucked up with Kabuto's genetic modifications by reversing their effects AND liberate him from the reincarnation jutsu, while remaining coherent with the Shinto Goddess' theme.",

He slaughtered a bunch of women and children instead of even entertaining the idea that this whole thing could be resolved with no innocent lives lost. He could've at least tried for the bloodless route instead of saying \"no, that won't work\" and killing a bunch of people anyways.\n\nLike, what was the worst case scenario? He attempts the takeover with his dad. They lose. The Leaf slaughters the Uchicha anyway. Best case scenario? The Uchicha take control of the village and innocent people don't die.

The reason people blame Danzo is because he purposely interfered in the efforts to stop the coup without killing them, which means that he is directly responsible (and intentionally so) for the massacre. Shisui was to handle the situation and he would've done so far more efficiently with much less risk or bloodshed than Itachi could ever manage. Danzo is responsible for his death, and managed to take one of his eyes. Itachi was 14. A literal child. Just one year older than the Konoha 12 genin are in part 1. Danzo was the adult manipulating him and intentionally forcing him into a situation where he had to choose between the wellbeing of the clan or the overall village. And he chose the village. Were there other options, or ways he could've gone about it that didn't involve killing everyone? Yea probably. But being a literal child, manipulated by a cunning and disgustingly self-centered man, even if he had realized one of those options and attempted it Danzo would've just had him killed too. And then taken his eyes for good measure. And do you really want Danzo having access to both Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi, not to mention amaterasu? No! That would be bad. Itachi did his best given that he was a child forced into a horrific situation, backed frantically into a corner and given a hellish choice. Nobody among us, as 14 year olds, would've fared any better than he did. Critics and fans alike would've probably screwed up even worse than him",

Itachi was strong af, but I don't think he surpassed Shisui instantly upon getting the mangekyo. And Shisui could only manage to escape Danzo. It's the whole backup thing that matters the most, because as strong as Itachi is the Anbu tend to not be fodder in situations like these. Having them backing up Danzo is a problem.",

As far as he knew there were no other options, although the things you said would've been great ideas if he'd had them. I just meant Itachi by himself would've lost to Danzo, if he were put in the same situation that Shisui was put in. Also, no war would not have been better than the genocide of the Uchiha clan. The Uchiha clan consisted of a few hundred people at most. The Hidden Leaf Village is several times larger. The fear with the coup was that it would destabilize the Hidden Leaf, making it vulnerable to attack from the outside. It would've ultimately been destroyed by foreign powers such as the Land of Lightning which at that time was still hostile to the Land of Fire and by proxy the Hidden Leaf. Same goes for the Land of Water and the Hidden Mist. They would've torn the Leaf apart. It's better to sacrifice a few hundred people to save the lives of thousands of others and prevent another world war.",

It's why later Naruto and most of Boruto are shit, because they do not contain such fights.\n\nKishimoto is obviously free to do what he wants. I'm free to call it shit because it's shit. You're free to post inarticulate responses to comments you have difficulty reading. Everything works out in the end.",

It\u2019s not heart breaking when krillin dies to king piccolo and the dragon balls aren\u2019t available. It\u2019s not triumphant when goku wins against king piccolo and piccolo jr. having the main character die is also something for the fans at the start of dbz. No strategy vs vegeta, the spirit bomb always works on destroying the Bad guys like freeza and boo. There is nothing in dbz to which the fan base can cling to it\u2019s just bing explosions and destroying wastelands. Dbz is trash and wouldn\u2019t never get 2 sequels like idk GT and super. \n\nThere was and has been strategic maneuvers in dbz, to say otherwise is just to hate on something popular. Things in that world have reason. Instant teleportation, time travel, fusions, afterlife, all have reason to them. Is the main race in the show kinda bullshit compared to a regular human? Yeah but that\u2019s established in chapter one of the dragonball, dude has a tail. \n\nThe only way we are going to get more Naruto content is boruto. Is it kinda wack right now? Yeah, was the time skip at the beginning kinda wack too? Yeah, but it\u2019s this or nothing. I think it\u2019s good enough. I much prefer to read the work then watch it. Years ago when Naruto was on tv like the original series I remember that it was kinda dumb. But now I have 40+ books of the series. Boruto could get better. If we give it a chance.",

Izanami is cool and I love that battle, but it just doesn't make sense.\n\nIMO it would've been more fitting to Japanese folklore if Izanami was related to death, it should've been a genjutsu that, instead of using time loops, blurred the line between life and death, either by making lethal attacks miss or by reversing the effect of life-related techniques. Remember that the tale of Izanami and Izanagi is basically the same tale as Orpheus and Eurydice.\n\nIt would've both fucked up with Kabuto's genetic modifications by reversing their effects AND liberate him from the reincarnation jutsu, while remaining coherent with the Shinto Goddess' theme.",

He slaughtered a bunch of women and children instead of even entertaining the idea that this whole thing could be resolved with no innocent lives lost. He could've at least tried for the bloodless route instead of saying \"no, that won't work\" and killing a bunch of people anyways.\n\nLike, what was the worst case scenario?

The reason people blame Danzo is because he purposely interfered in the efforts to stop the coup without killing them, which means that he is directly responsible (and intentionally so) for the massacre. Shisui was to handle the situation and he would've done so far more efficiently with much less risk or bloodshed than Itachi could ever manage. Danzo is responsible for his death, and managed to take one of his eyes. Itachi was 14. A literal child. Just one year older than the Konoha 12 genin are in part 1. Danzo was the adult manipulating him and intentionally forcing him into a situation where he had to choose between the wellbeing of the clan or the overall village. And he chose the village. Were there other options, or ways he could've gone about it that didn't involve killing everyone? Yea probably. But being a literal child, manipulated by a cunning and disgustingly self-centered man, even if he had realized one of those options and attempted it Danzo would've just had him killed too. And then taken his eyes for good measure. And do you really want Danzo having access to both Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi, not to mention amaterasu? No! That would be bad. Itachi did his best given that he was a child forced into a horrific situation, backed frantically into a corner and given a hellish choice. Nobody among us, as 14 year olds, would've fared any better than he did. Critics and fans alike would've probably screwed up even worse than him",

The Uchiha clan consisted of a few hundred people at most. The Hidden Leaf Village is several times larger. The fear with the coup was that it would destabilize the Hidden Leaf, making it vulnerable to attack from the outside. It would've ultimately been destroyed by foreign powers such as the Land of Lightning which at that time was still hostile to the Land of Fire and by proxy the Hidden Leaf.

It\u2019s not triumphant when goku wins against king piccolo and piccolo jr. having the main character die is also something for the fans at the start of dbz. No strategy vs vegeta, the spirit bomb always works on destroying the Bad guys like freeza and boo. There is nothing in dbz to which the fan base can cling to it\u2019s just bing explosions and destroying wastelands. Dbz is trash and wouldn\u2019t never get 2 sequels like idk GT and super. \n\nThere was and has been strategic maneuvers in dbz, to say otherwise is just to hate on something popular. Things in that world have reason. Instant teleportation, time travel, fusions, afterlife, all have reason to them. Is the main race in the show kinda bullshit compared to a regular human? Yeah but that\u2019s established in chapter one of the dragonball, dude has a tail. \n\nThe only way we are going to get more Naruto content is boruto. Is it kinda wack right now? Yeah, was the time skip at the beginning kinda wack too? Yeah, but it\u2019s this or nothing. I think it\u2019s good enough. I much prefer to read the work then watch it. Years ago when Naruto was on tv like the original series I remember that it was kinda dumb. But now I have 40+ books of the series. Boruto could get better. If we give it a chance.",

Remember that the tale of Izanami and Izanagi is basically the same tale as Orpheus and Eurydice.\n\nIt would've both fucked up with Kabuto's genetic modifications by reversing their effects AND liberate him from the reincarnation jutsu, while remaining coherent with the Shinto Goddess' theme.",

The reason people blame Danzo is because he purposely interfered in the efforts to stop the coup without killing them, which means that he is directly responsible (and intentionally so) for the massacre. Shisui was to handle the situation and he would've done so far more efficiently with much less risk or bloodshed than Itachi could ever manage. Danzo is responsible for his death, and managed to take one of his eyes. Itachi was 14. A literal child. Just one year older than the Konoha 12 genin are in part 1. Danzo was the adult manipulating him and intentionally forcing him into a situation where he had to choose between the wellbeing of the clan or the overall village. And he chose the village. Were there other options, or ways he could've gone about it that didn't involve killing everyone? Yea probably. But being a literal child, manipulated by a cunning and disgustingly self-centered man, even if he had realized one of those options and attempted it Danzo would've just had him killed too. And then taken his eyes for good measure. And do you really want Danzo having access to both Kotoamatsukami and Tsukuyomi, not to mention amaterasu? No! That would be bad. Itachi did his best given that he was a child forced into a horrific situation, backed frantically into a corner and given a hellish choice. Nobody among us, as 14 year olds, would've fared any better than he did. Critics and fans alike would've probably screwed up even worse than him",

The Uchiha clan consisted of a few hundred people at most. The Hidden Leaf Village is several times larger. The fear with the coup was that it would destabilize the Hidden Leaf, making it vulnerable to attack from the outside. It would've ultimately been destroyed by foreign powers such as the Land of Lightning which at that time was still hostile to the Land of Fire and by proxy the Hidden Leaf. Same goes for the Land of Water and the Hidden Mist. They would've torn the Leaf apart. It's better to sacrifice a few hundred people to save the lives of thousands of others and prevent another world war.",

Hell, the high ranking officers, Jonin, are the only ones who get to vote.\n\n\n\n\n\n>It is heinous, the murder of children. But Itachi literally has his hands tied. If he participates in the coup then he, Fugaku and Shisui are literally the only heavy hitters on his side. Fugaku is featless, Shisui got his shit kicked in by the root and danzo, and if Itachi is also taken out of the equation then it's gonna be a bloody battle for the uchihas, they'll fight tooth and nail and both sides will have heavy casualties and a lot of dead bodies but in the end, they will lose.\n\n\nShisui was led to a trap by Danzo. The only fucker who wanted to jump the gun was Danzo, killing him is far less problematic than what he ended doing.\nHiruzen wanted to keep the negotiation, another settlement could have been reached, like the Uchiha simply abandoning the Leaf and doing their own thing like the Uzumaki did.\nWe'll never know.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Naruto is set in a mediaeval setting, so killing children who may become a threat in the future is reasonable.\n\nThat's just bullshit.  The show calls out this type of reasoning again and again but some fans will always want to play realpolitik.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Why the children would be discriminated against? What kinda question is that? Naruto is looked down upon and discriminated against because in thier eyes, he is related to a tragedy (death of lord fourth) and he might become a threat to the village (being the vessel for a monster which can reduce landscapes into ashes) they will see the surving uchiha children with the same gaze as they see naruto.\n\nWhy? Naruto had a Kaiju demon living inside of him and Jinchuriki are discriminated, that's just the norm. \nThe Uchiha children are completely blameless, why would most people discriminate them?\n\n\n\n\n\n>And Itachi would've succeeded in breaking the wheel it wasn't for kabuto. The moment Naruto saw assume, kotoamatsukami would've been activated and sasuke would have the urge to protect the village.\n\n\nUntil the jutsu was broken. That's some way of breaking the wheel by commiting genocide, becoming a terrorist and literally mind control those who dissent with you.",

Citation needed.\n\n\n\n\n>It's not just my opinion it's something happens in real life discrimination doesn't have to make sense, they can hate you if you're associated with something they don't like. Most people were ignorant of Narutos story they just hated him because they didn't understand anything about him, they only knew that he was associated with the death of lord forth and he has kurama in him.\n\nIt's your opinion, you're presenting a bleak picture and pretending it's the only way.\nJinchuriki are always hated and Naruto having a Kaiju demon inside him made people distrustful. Not the same with Uchiha children.",

It\u2019s not triumphant when goku wins against king piccolo and piccolo jr. having the main character die is also something for the fans at the start of dbz. No strategy vs vegeta, the spirit bomb always works on destroying the Bad guys like freeza and boo. There is nothing in dbz to which the fan base can cling to it\u2019s just bing explosions and destroying wastelands. Dbz is trash and wouldn\u2019t never get 2 sequels like idk GT and super. \n\nThere was and has been strategic maneuvers in dbz, to say otherwise is just to hate on something popular. Things in that world have reason. Instant teleportation, time travel, fusions, afterlife, all have reason to them. Is the main race in the show kinda bullshit compared to a regular human? Yeah but that\u2019s established in chapter one of the dragonball, dude has a tail. \n\nThe only way we are going to get more Naruto content is boruto. Is it kinda wack right now? Yeah, was the time skip at the beginning kinda wack too? Yeah, but it\u2019s this or nothing. I think it\u2019s good enough. I much prefer to read the work then watch it. Years ago when Naruto was on tv like the original series I remember that it was kinda dumb. But now I have 40+ books of the series. Boruto could get better. If we give it a chance.",

Remember that the tale of Izanami and Izanagi is basically the same tale as Orpheus and Eurydice.\n\nIt would've both fucked up with Kabuto's genetic modifications by reversing their effects AND liberate him from the reincarnation jutsu, while remaining coherent with the Shinto Goddess' theme.",

As far as he knew there were no other options, although the things you said would've been great ideas if he'd had them. I just meant Itachi by himself would've lost to Danzo, if he were put in the same situation that Shisui was put in. Also, no war would not have been better than the genocide of the Uchiha clan. The Uchiha clan consisted of a few hundred people at most. The Hidden Leaf Village is several times larger. The fear with the coup was that it would destabilize the Hidden Leaf, making it vulnerable to attack from the outside. It would've ultimately been destroyed by foreign powers such as the Land of Lightning which at that time was still hostile to the Land of Fire and by proxy the Hidden Leaf. Same goes for the Land of Water and the Hidden Mist. They would've torn the Leaf apart. It's better to sacrifice a few hundred people to save the lives of thousands of others and prevent another world war.",

I'm sure Kishimoto had a thousand different compelling ideas of how the story surrounding the Uchiha could have gone.

It\u2019s not triumphant when goku wins against king piccolo and piccolo jr. having the main character die is also something for the fans at the start of dbz. No strategy vs vegeta, the spirit bomb always works on destroying the Bad guys like freeza and boo. There is nothing in dbz to which the fan base can cling to it\u2019s just bing explosions and destroying wastelands. Dbz is trash and wouldn\u2019t never get 2 sequels like idk GT and super. \n\nThere was and has been strategic maneuvers in dbz, to say otherwise is just to hate on something popular. Things in that world have reason. Instant teleportation, time travel, fusions, afterlife, all have reason to them. Is the main race in the show kinda bullshit compared to a regular human? Yeah but that\u2019s established in chapter one of the dragonball, dude has a tail. \n\nThe only way we are going to get more Naruto content is boruto. Is it kinda wack right now? Yeah, was the time skip at the beginning kinda wack too? Yeah, but it\u2019s this or nothing. I think it\u2019s good enough. I much prefer to read the work then watch it. Years ago when Naruto was on tv like the original series I remember that it was kinda dumb. But now I have 40+ books of the series. Boruto could get better. If we give it a chance.",

I just meant Itachi by himself would've lost to Danzo, if he were put in the same situation that Shisui was put in. Also, no war would not have been better than the genocide of the Uchiha clan. The Uchiha clan consisted of a few hundred people at most. The Hidden Leaf Village is several times larger. The fear with the coup was that it would destabilize the Hidden Leaf, making it vulnerable to attack from the outside. It would've ultimately been destroyed by foreign powers such as the Land of Lightning which at that time was still hostile to the Land of Fire and by proxy the Hidden Leaf. Same goes for the Land of Water and the Hidden Mist. They would've torn the Leaf apart.

Instead of stopping the coup use it for a good purpose and compromise with hiruzen about what to do with danzo, war is better than outright genocide I believe. Hell, even simpler he could just track obito and use his help like he actually did for the uchiha massacre, and I'm pretty sure danzo and his anbu squad ain't fucking with obito lol. Itachi just has to make some sort of deal him like he did in the anime. After that, shit maybe enact his fucked up sasuke plan to beat obito lol",
