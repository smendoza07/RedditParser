In 100 years that is only  6000 chunin for the whole continent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere do sixty thousand come from?  This shinobi business isn't for the faint of heart and many die in the field before even being chunin. So how are there so many?  Some say maybe most genin are promoted outside of the exams but why was Naruto never promoted then especially after the Kakuzu fight or Pein?",

In 100 years that is only  6000 chunin for the whole continent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere do sixty thousand come from?  This shinobi business isn't for the faint of heart and many die in the field before even being chunin. So how are there so many?  Some say maybe most genin are promoted outside of the exams but why was Naruto never promoted then especially after the Kakuzu fight or Pein?",

In 100 years that is only  6000 chunin for the whole continent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere do sixty thousand come from?  This shinobi business isn't for the faint of heart and many die in the field before even being chunin. So how are there so many?  Some say maybe most genin are promoted outside of the exams but why was Naruto never promoted then especially after the Kakuzu fight or Pein?",

In 100 years that is only  6000 chunin for the whole continent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere do sixty thousand come from?  This shinobi business isn't for the faint of heart and many die in the field before even being chunin. So how are there so many?

In 100 years that is only  6000 chunin for the whole continent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere do sixty thousand come from?  This shinobi business isn't for the faint of heart and many die in the field before even being chunin. So how are there so many?

In 100 years that is only  6000 chunin for the whole continent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere do sixty thousand come from?  This shinobi business isn't for the faint of heart and many die in the field before even being chunin. So how are there so many?
