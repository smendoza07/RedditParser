Salt and pepper on men is highly flattering. 9/10 times, my clients are usually feeling a little insecure because their wives want to push you to do your hair how SHE wants it done. \n\nCould you imagine if you told your wife \"I like your hair better when it's dark, and not grey.\" You'd sleep on the couch hungry for a week. Why should women dictate men's hair? \n\nIf it's something you really want to for \ud835\ude6e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude5b, go for it. A lot of barber shops offer grey blending services. You can camouflage and blend the grey in with a semi permanent color. It takes 10 minutes from start to finish, and can be done when you go for a routine hair appointment. It's not an opaque color, so it doesn't look unnatural. That option could be the best of both worlds for appeasing your wife, while also keeping maintenance low.",
