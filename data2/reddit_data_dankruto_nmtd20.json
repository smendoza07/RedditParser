And every opening makes it look like Naruto is Prince Charming trying to save Princess Sasuke from his prison, or like they're lovers that can't be together because their time isn't right yet, but they remember all the good times that they spent in their youth. Also their families hate each other which presents another relationship obstacle",

Having an actual useful female main character who could rival Naruto's strength would immidiatly improve the entire series.\n\nWhy would them being gay be a troll? There hasn't been much romance until the last chapters (and arguably the climax of the pain arc), so them being straight doesn't matter either. And the whole \"brother\" thing going on between Naruto and Sasuke can be read easily as them being  more than just friends.\n\nIf you think 95% of the fanbase is homophobic you should probably stop browsing homophobic anime and manga communities.\n\nAnd normalizing lgbtq+ relationships would also help reduce people getting pissed for no reason in the long run.\n\nFuck homophobes.",

At the point in their life they would be more about getting a hot chick to date, rather than seeing a girl as  a mc or cool character battling on the front lines. And i never said women didn't like action. And boys tend to like characters of the same gender. That's just something simple. Oh and sidenote, there isn't sexism in shonen and i'm not promoting sexism in shonen, all i said was most people who watch shonen expect a male mc fighting alot and the girls not being very useful. Its just that most of the females were badly written, not represented correctly, and ended up as housewives in the end unfortunetely :(",

And every opening makes it look like Naruto is Prince Charming trying to save Princess Sasuke from his prison, or like they're lovers that can't be together because their time isn't right yet, but they remember all the good times that they spent in their youth. Also their families hate each other which presents another relationship obstacle",

There hasn't been much romance until the last chapters (and arguably the climax of the pain arc), so them being straight doesn't matter either. And the whole \"brother\" thing going on between Naruto and Sasuke can be read easily as them being  more than just friends.\n\nIf you think 95% of the fanbase is homophobic you should probably stop browsing homophobic anime and manga communities.\n\nAnd normalizing lgbtq+ relationships would also help reduce people getting pissed for no reason in the long run.\n\nFuck homophobes.",

Two of your scentences are inn all caps when i only had cps to explain the accuracy of something, hell, you even called me and absolute moron! And i'm talking about young teenage boys. as in 14-16 year olds, not a 18-20 year old men that understand representation, or aren't bothered b representation. At the point in their life they would be more about getting a hot chick to date, rather than seeing a girl as  a mc or cool character battling on the front lines. And i never said women didn't like action. And boys tend to like characters of the same gender. That's just something simple. Oh and sidenote, there isn't sexism in shonen and i'm not promoting sexism in shonen, all i said was most people who watch shonen expect a male mc fighting alot and the girls not being very useful. Its just that most of the females were badly written, not represented correctly, and ended up as housewives in the end unfortunetely :(",

There hasn't been much romance until the last chapters (and arguably the climax of the pain arc), so them being straight doesn't matter either. And the whole \"brother\" thing going on between Naruto and Sasuke can be read easily as them being  more than just friends.\n\nIf you think 95% of the fanbase is homophobic you should probably stop browsing homophobic anime and manga communities.\n\nAnd normalizing lgbtq+ relationships would also help reduce people getting pissed for no reason in the long run.\n\nFuck homophobes.",

Two of your scentences are inn all caps when i only had cps to explain the accuracy of something, hell, you even called me and absolute moron! And i'm talking about young teenage boys. as in 14-16 year olds, not a 18-20 year old men that understand representation, or aren't bothered b representation. At the point in their life they would be more about getting a hot chick to date, rather than seeing a girl as  a mc or cool character battling on the front lines. And i never said women didn't like action. And boys tend to like characters of the same gender. That's just something simple. Oh and sidenote, there isn't sexism in shonen and i'm not promoting sexism in shonen, all i said was most people who watch shonen expect a male mc fighting alot and the girls not being very useful. Its just that most of the females were badly written, not represented correctly, and ended up as housewives in the end unfortunetely :(",

At the point in their life they would be more about getting a hot chick to date, rather than seeing a girl as  a mc or cool character battling on the front lines. And i never said women didn't like action. And boys tend to like characters of the same gender. That's just something simple. Oh and sidenote, there isn't sexism in shonen and i'm not promoting sexism in shonen, all i said was most people who watch shonen expect a male mc fighting alot and the girls not being very useful. Its just that most of the females were badly written, not represented correctly, and ended up as housewives in the end unfortunetely :(",

And every opening makes it look like Naruto is Prince Charming trying to save Princess Sasuke from his prison, or like they're lovers that can't be together because their time isn't right yet, but they remember all the good times that they spent in their youth. Also their families hate each other which presents another relationship obstacle",

At the point in their life they would be more about getting a hot chick to date, rather than seeing a girl as  a mc or cool character battling on the front lines. And i never said women didn't like action. And boys tend to like characters of the same gender. That's just something simple. Oh and sidenote, there isn't sexism in shonen and i'm not promoting sexism in shonen, all i said was most people who watch shonen expect a male mc fighting alot and the girls not being very useful. Its just that most of the females were badly written, not represented correctly, and ended up as housewives in the end unfortunetely :(",

Two of your scentences are inn all caps when i only had cps to explain the accuracy of something, hell, you even called me and absolute moron! And i'm talking about young teenage boys. as in 14-16 year olds, not a 18-20 year old men that understand representation, or aren't bothered b representation. At the point in their life they would be more about getting a hot chick to date, rather than seeing a girl as  a mc or cool character battling on the front lines. And i never said women didn't like action. And boys tend to like characters of the same gender. That's just something simple. Oh and sidenote, there isn't sexism in shonen and i'm not promoting sexism in shonen, all i said was most people who watch shonen expect a male mc fighting alot and the girls not being very useful. Its just that most of the females were badly written, not represented correctly, and ended up as housewives in the end unfortunetely :(",

At the point in their life they would be more about getting a hot chick to date, rather than seeing a girl as  a mc or cool character battling on the front lines. And i never said women didn't like action. And boys tend to like characters of the same gender. That's just something simple. Oh and sidenote, there isn't sexism in shonen and i'm not promoting sexism in shonen, all i said was most people who watch shonen expect a male mc fighting alot and the girls not being very useful. Its just that most of the females were badly written, not represented correctly, and ended up as housewives in the end unfortunetely :(",

At the point in their life they would be more about getting a hot chick to date, rather than seeing a girl as  a mc or cool character battling on the front lines. And i never said women didn't like action. And boys tend to like characters of the same gender. That's just something simple. Oh and sidenote, there isn't sexism in shonen and i'm not promoting sexism in shonen, all i said was most people who watch shonen expect a male mc fighting alot and the girls not being very useful. Its just that most of the females were badly written, not represented correctly, and ended up as housewives in the end unfortunetely :(",
