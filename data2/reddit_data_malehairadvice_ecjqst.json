I believe what is taking place is that due to angle of his head relative to the lens and due to varying shadowing, his neck is extending his face length in Style 1 while his face is focused on without the added length of the neck in Style 2. Further, his front hairline is lower than average and his forehead area smaller than average, the added volume/height in Style 2 balances out the areas of the face due to the smaller forehead, closer to the classical ideal which is for  the vertical length of the face from the center of the front hairline to the tip of the chin to be split in equal thirds- forehead, nose, mouth-chin. Style 1 would appear well balanced by having slightly longer sideburns, extending to about the middle of the ear opening,  which would shorten the appearance of the lower face. Style 2 would appear more balanced with more volume on the back/sides, in other words a longer taper. \n\nTapers, extra long to short...\n\nregular haircut, extra long taper on the back/sides...\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ndRLbmv.jpg\n\nregular haircut, long taper on the back/sides...\nhttps://i.imgur.com/EtTamWs.jpg\n\nregular haircut, medium taper on the back/sides...\nhttps://i.imgur.com/wPtNlS2.jpg\n\nregular haircut, semi-short taper on the back/sides...\nhttps://i.imgur.com/lnog9Z2.jpg\n\nregular haircut, short taper on the back/sides...\nhttps://i.imgur.com/17C2Ng3.jpg\n\nHair grows at an average rate of 1/8\" per week.

I believe what is taking place is that due to angle of his head relative to the lens and due to varying shadowing, his neck is extending his face length in Style 1 while his face is focused on without the added length of the neck in Style 2. Further, his front hairline is lower than average and his forehead area smaller than average, the added volume/height in Style 2 balances out the areas of the face due to the smaller forehead, closer to the classical ideal which is for  the vertical length of the face from the center of the front hairline to the tip of the chin to be split in equal thirds- forehead, nose, mouth-chin. Style 1 would appear well balanced by having slightly longer sideburns, extending to about the middle of the ear opening,  which would shorten the appearance of the lower face. Style 2 would appear more balanced with more volume on the back/sides, in other words a longer taper. \n\nTapers, extra long to short...\n\nregular haircut, extra long taper on the back/sides...\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ndRLbmv.jpg\n\nregular haircut, long taper on the back/sides...\nhttps://i.imgur.com/EtTamWs.jpg\n\nregular haircut, medium taper on the back/sides...\nhttps://i.imgur.com/wPtNlS2.jpg\n\nregular haircut, semi-short taper on the back/sides...\nhttps://i.imgur.com/lnog9Z2.jpg\n\nregular haircut, short taper on the back/sides...\nhttps://i.imgur.com/17C2Ng3.jpg\n\nHair grows at an average rate of 1/8\" per week.
