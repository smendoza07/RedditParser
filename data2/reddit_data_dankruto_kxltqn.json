I loved the OG anime. To me, it's perfect, and stops right where it should.\n\nHonestly though, I think HxH could easily be ended. I thought the Chimera arc alone was already weird as fuck and sorta felt out of place to me, so I guess maybe in that aspect I sort of agree with you? But again, it's not necessarily for lack of ideas. It's well known that the creator has health problems keeping him from working on HxH at his full potential.",
