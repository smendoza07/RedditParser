None of my friends are into anime so I finally said fuck it I'm going by myself!!\n\n(And before anyone lectures me about how I should use my allowance to buy the pass, my SD frequently offers to buy me things outside of my allowance so it's not a big deal)",

It's a free program they got me onto and is simple and fun enough that you could potentially intro your sugarbabes into toying with 3d designs themselves...

I just finished doing a Bear upgrade on a Prusa MK3. Those in my opinion are some of the best printers out there. My SB has been playing with researching printing things with TPU (the flexible filaments). They are a pain in the ass in comparison to the standard PLA and PETG plastics. She's committed to teaching me when she figures it all out :-)\n\n> Have you used Sculptris before?\n\nNope. haven't heard of that actually. I've been knee-deep in Fusion 360 and all the tutorials for that software. It is utterly amazing! I had started with OpenSCAD - which is pretty cool actually in that you make the stuff basically with straight code - but still prefer Fusion 360 for designing things now. The output from it can either go to the 3D printer via the slicer, or to my CNC if what I'm making calls for milling.",

I can cobble up functional piece things in Fusion 360 and other software, and tune printers/cnc/lathe stuff - but as to sculpting something? \n\nMe trying to sculpt would look like some grown man that took a full hit of acid and started sculpting a masterpiece with raw materials. But in reality winds up just walking around the room muttering something about \"Shhhh! Listen! The marshmallows are speaking!\" and not sculpting diddly.\n\n> It's great you've managed to match up with a SB that's learning that stuff though!\n\nYep. Not a day goes by where I don't feel blessed to have who I do in my life.",

                                            "body": "The first one is on the right track. The main idea behind it is that in a dog\u2019s life, they get to choose very little. Choice and control are major reinforcers for dogs. I\u2019ve seen this done mainly with handling and husbandry practices. I think we all know that dog who HATES his nails trimmed. Consent is basically allowing your dog to walk away at any time. Yes, we need to trim the nails. Normally what happens is the dog is put in a muzzle and restrained. That is extremely aversive and traumatic to a dog and causes more discomfort and the dog tries to escalate his behavior to make it stop. But if we slowly recondition the dog, and allow the dog that choice to walk away, they often become a lot more likely to stay there or will come back after they\u2019ve settled down, and they will stop biting and growling since they know they can walk away.\n\nI\u2019ve also seen an example where the dog went to work with the owner every day, but one day the dog didn\u2019t come to the door and stayed in her crate. The owner didn\u2019t force her out and take her to work anyway, she left her there and gave her a break for the day. The next day, the dog bounced to the door and went to work like usual. Like humans, dogs have their off days too, and by forcing that dog to go to work when they were trying to express that they didn\u2019t feel like it, it could have led to a bad day for both involved. Maybe the dog may have been grumpy that day and caused stress on the owner, maybe something else would have happened. By giving that dog the choice, you let her have some more control in her life, and many say that it leads to better communication between dog and handler.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever heard of Puppy Culture, you\u2019ve likely heard of manding. Puppy Culture is known to produce confident, well-adjusted puppies and adult dogs. They\u2019re extraordinary in many things, and I\u2019d love to have more experience with it. I\u2019d attribute this largely to the teaching of manding. Many trainers teach that the dog has to sit to be petted or given a treat. That\u2019s not what manding is at all. Most PC breeders use a sit as their manding behavior, as that\u2019s the most obvious to people, but it can be any behavior. Manding is simply teaching the dog to communicate their needs to the humans. Allowing that puppy to express \u201cHey, I want something.\u201d gives them a lot more confidence and resilience than dogs who are not given that communication at all. \n\nIt\u2019s often related to giving you the words \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d in a language and then sending you to another country. Without those two main words, you\u2019d probably be extremely insecure and unsure of what\u2019s going on. But if you have those words to communicate your wants, then you\u2019ll be a lot more relaxed and confident in the country.\n\nI\u2019m by no means an expert, but if you\u2019re interested if highly recommend looking it up for better information. I may have said some things in a confusing way, as I\u2019m still learning about it myself. But it\u2019s effects on dogs is pretty immense and can benefit both canine and handler. It\u2019s all about communication and listening to one another.",

That truly is a brilliant concept to training, and I love anything that reinforces any living beings respect and autonomy :)\n\nI've done that with my girls without being aware of the concept itself/researching any professional training technique.\n\nThe thing I get most fallback? (can't think of the word I wanted) from others opinions is that I don't 'dominate' my dogs enough.. Namely that I ask my girls to do something nicely (with a please) and give them a moment to respond before I change tone/get snappy... Apparently everyone finds me weird for doing that, but more times than not they will do what they're asked nicely and I have no need to repeat myself in a more domineering way... Hell my older girl hates being washed and will run away but all I have to do is go \"C'mon we're not finished yet\" and she trots back.",

And the kicker is, dominance as it is used by compulsion trainers and dominance trainers (*cough cough Cesar Millan*) has been debunked for DECADES... by the same guy who COINED IT. He has begged the scientific community to redact the study for inaccuracy but people still use it. And dogs aren\u2019t wolves! Studies done on packs of stray dogs in other areas especially Easter Europe show that dog packs do not work like wolf packs. Wolf packs are solely family structures, no Alpha wolf in sight. Dog packs are way looser and they take turns being in charge. And they don\u2019t stay in packs, they\u2019re more like casual acquaintances. \n\nI\u2019m the same way with my dog. He\u2019s more sensitive to me, as I can slightly raise my voice and he slinks down and cowers, but another person can scream and he isn\u2019t fazed at all. And I\u2019ve never once hit him and I don\u2019t yell at him ever. I think it\u2019s just our relationship that it affects him more. Positive reinforcement goes a long way. I posted a video to a training group asking a question about something I did (I taught my dog to speak by using another dog who knew the cue and having my dog watch what the other dog did and get a treat so he\u2019d copy him), and I got a few comments how his tail wagged the ENTIRE video. I ask him to do things nicely, and he complies if you give him a moment to think and he knows what you\u2019re asking. I\u2019ve never had to dominate a dog in 20 years. Not to mention that stuff is dangerous, and that\u2019s how a lot of dogs turn aggressive, by being flipped over in an alpha roll or being forced into positions. Ask any dog trainer in the military from maybe 20 years ago how many bites they received and what they were doing.",

I just finished doing a Bear upgrade on a Prusa MK3. Those in my opinion are some of the best printers out there. My SB has been playing with researching printing things with TPU (the flexible filaments). They are a pain in the ass in comparison to the standard PLA and PETG plastics. She's committed to teaching me when she figures it all out :-)\n\n> Have you used Sculptris before?\n\nNope. haven't heard of that actually. I've been knee-deep in Fusion 360 and all the tutorials for that software. It is utterly amazing! I had started with OpenSCAD - which is pretty cool actually in that you make the stuff basically with straight code - but still prefer Fusion 360 for designing things now. The output from it can either go to the 3D printer via the slicer, or to my CNC if what I'm making calls for milling.",

I can cobble up functional piece things in Fusion 360 and other software, and tune printers/cnc/lathe stuff - but as to sculpting something? \n\nMe trying to sculpt would look like some grown man that took a full hit of acid and started sculpting a masterpiece with raw materials.

The marshmallows are speaking!\" and not sculpting diddly.\n\n> It's great you've managed to match up with a SB that's learning that stuff though!\n\nYep.

                                    "body": "The first one is on the right track. The main idea behind it is that in a dog\u2019s life, they get to choose very little. Choice and control are major reinforcers for dogs. I\u2019ve seen this done mainly with handling and husbandry practices. I think we all know that dog who HATES his nails trimmed. Consent is basically allowing your dog to walk away at any time. Yes, we need to trim the nails. Normally what happens is the dog is put in a muzzle and restrained. That is extremely aversive and traumatic to a dog and causes more discomfort and the dog tries to escalate his behavior to make it stop. But if we slowly recondition the dog, and allow the dog that choice to walk away, they often become a lot more likely to stay there or will come back after they\u2019ve settled down, and they will stop biting and growling since they know they can walk away.\n\nI\u2019ve also seen an example where the dog went to work with the owner every day, but one day the dog didn\u2019t come to the door and stayed in her crate. The owner didn\u2019t force her out and take her to work anyway, she left her there and gave her a break for the day. The next day, the dog bounced to the door and went to work like usual. Like humans, dogs have their off days too, and by forcing that dog to go to work when they were trying to express that they didn\u2019t feel like it, it could have led to a bad day for both involved. Maybe the dog may have been grumpy that day and caused stress on the owner, maybe something else would have happened. By giving that dog the choice, you let her have some more control in her life, and many say that it leads to better communication between dog and handler.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever heard of Puppy Culture, you\u2019ve likely heard of manding. Puppy Culture is known to produce confident, well-adjusted puppies and adult dogs. They\u2019re extraordinary in many things, and I\u2019d love to have more experience with it. I\u2019d attribute this largely to the teaching of manding. Many trainers teach that the dog has to sit to be petted or given a treat. That\u2019s not what manding is at all. Most PC breeders use a sit as their manding behavior, as that\u2019s the most obvious to people, but it can be any behavior. Manding is simply teaching the dog to communicate their needs to the humans. Allowing that puppy to express \u201cHey, I want something.\u201d gives them a lot more confidence and resilience than dogs who are not given that communication at all. \n\nIt\u2019s often related to giving you the words \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d in a language and then sending you to another country. Without those two main words, you\u2019d probably be extremely insecure and unsure of what\u2019s going on. But if you have those words to communicate your wants, then you\u2019ll be a lot more relaxed and confident in the country.\n\nI\u2019m by no means an expert, but if you\u2019re interested if highly recommend looking it up for better information. I may have said some things in a confusing way, as I\u2019m still learning about it myself. But it\u2019s effects on dogs is pretty immense and can benefit both canine and handler. It\u2019s all about communication and listening to one another.",

That truly is a brilliant concept to training, and I love anything that reinforces any living beings respect and autonomy :)\n\nI've done that with my girls without being aware of the concept itself/researching any professional training technique.\n\nThe thing I get most fallback? (can't think of the word I wanted) from others opinions is that I don't 'dominate' my dogs enough.. Namely that I ask my girls to do something nicely (with a please) and give them a moment to respond before I change tone/get snappy... Apparently everyone finds me weird for doing that, but more times than not they will do what they're asked nicely and I have no need to repeat myself in a more domineering way... Hell my older girl hates being washed and will run away but all I have to do is go \"C'mon we're not finished yet\" and she trots back.",

And the kicker is, dominance as it is used by compulsion trainers and dominance trainers (*cough cough Cesar Millan*) has been debunked for DECADES... by the same guy who COINED IT. He has begged the scientific community to redact the study for inaccuracy but people still use it. And dogs aren\u2019t wolves! Studies done on packs of stray dogs in other areas especially Easter Europe show that dog packs do not work like wolf packs. Wolf packs are solely family structures, no Alpha wolf in sight. Dog packs are way looser and they take turns being in charge. And they don\u2019t stay in packs, they\u2019re more like casual acquaintances. \n\nI\u2019m the same way with my dog. He\u2019s more sensitive to me, as I can slightly raise my voice and he slinks down and cowers, but another person can scream and he isn\u2019t fazed at all. And I\u2019ve never once hit him and I don\u2019t yell at him ever. I think it\u2019s just our relationship that it affects him more. Positive reinforcement goes a long way. I posted a video to a training group asking a question about something I did (I taught my dog to speak by using another dog who knew the cue and having my dog watch what the other dog did and get a treat so he\u2019d copy him), and I got a few comments how his tail wagged the ENTIRE video. I ask him to do things nicely, and he complies if you give him a moment to think and he knows what you\u2019re asking. I\u2019ve never had to dominate a dog in 20 years. Not to mention that stuff is dangerous, and that\u2019s how a lot of dogs turn aggressive, by being flipped over in an alpha roll or being forced into positions. Ask any dog trainer in the military from maybe 20 years ago how many bites they received and what they were doing.",

I just finished doing a Bear upgrade on a Prusa MK3. Those in my opinion are some of the best printers out there. My SB has been playing with researching printing things with TPU (the flexible filaments). They are a pain in the ass in comparison to the standard PLA and PETG plastics. She's committed to teaching me when she figures it all out :-)\n\n> Have you used Sculptris before?\n\nNope. haven't heard of that actually. I've been knee-deep in Fusion 360 and all the tutorials for that software. It is utterly amazing! I had started with OpenSCAD - which is pretty cool actually in that you make the stuff basically with straight code - but still prefer Fusion 360 for designing things now. The output from it can either go to the 3D printer via the slicer, or to my CNC if what I'm making calls for milling.",

I can cobble up functional piece things in Fusion 360 and other software, and tune printers/cnc/lathe stuff - but as to sculpting something? \n\nMe trying to sculpt would look like some grown man that took a full hit of acid and started sculpting a masterpiece with raw materials. But in reality winds up just walking around the room muttering something about \"Shhhh! Listen! The marshmallows are speaking!\" and not sculpting diddly.\n\n> It's great you've managed to match up with a SB that's learning that stuff though!\n\nYep.

That is extremely aversive and traumatic to a dog and causes more discomfort and the dog tries to escalate his behavior to make it stop. But if we slowly recondition the dog, and allow the dog that choice to walk away, they often become a lot more likely to stay there or will come back after they\u2019ve settled down, and they will stop biting and growling since they know they can walk away.\n\nI\u2019ve also seen an example where the dog went to work with the owner every day, but one day the dog didn\u2019t come to the door and stayed in her crate. The owner didn\u2019t force her out and take her to work anyway, she left her there and gave her a break for the day. The next day, the dog bounced to the door and went to work like usual. Like humans, dogs have their off days too, and by forcing that dog to go to work when they were trying to express that they didn\u2019t feel like it, it could have led to a bad day for both involved. Maybe the dog may have been grumpy that day and caused stress on the owner, maybe something else would have happened. By giving that dog the choice, you let her have some more control in her life, and many say that it leads to better communication between dog and handler.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever heard of Puppy Culture, you\u2019ve likely heard of manding. Puppy Culture is known to produce confident, well-adjusted puppies and adult dogs. They\u2019re extraordinary in many things, and I\u2019d love to have more experience with it. I\u2019d attribute this largely to the teaching of manding. Many trainers teach that the dog has to sit to be petted or given a treat. That\u2019s not what manding is at all. Most PC breeders use a sit as their manding behavior, as that\u2019s the most obvious to people, but it can be any behavior. Manding is simply teaching the dog to communicate their needs to the humans. Allowing that puppy to express \u201cHey, I want something.\u201d gives them a lot more confidence and resilience than dogs who are not given that communication at all. \n\nIt\u2019s often related to giving you the words \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d in a language and then sending you to another country. Without those two main words, you\u2019d probably be extremely insecure and unsure of what\u2019s going on. But if you have those words to communicate your wants, then you\u2019ll be a lot more relaxed and confident in the country.\n\nI\u2019m by no means an expert, but if you\u2019re interested if highly recommend looking it up for better information. I may have said some things in a confusing way, as I\u2019m still learning about it myself. But it\u2019s effects on dogs is pretty immense and can benefit both canine and handler. It\u2019s all about communication and listening to one another.",

Namely that I ask my girls to do something nicely (with a please) and give them a moment to respond before I change tone/get snappy...

And the kicker is, dominance as it is used by compulsion trainers and dominance trainers (*cough cough Cesar Millan*) has been debunked for DECADES... by the same guy who COINED IT. He has begged the scientific community to redact the study for inaccuracy but people still use it. And dogs aren\u2019t wolves! Studies done on packs of stray dogs in other areas especially Easter Europe show that dog packs do not work like wolf packs. Wolf packs are solely family structures, no Alpha wolf in sight. Dog packs are way looser and they take turns being in charge. And they don\u2019t stay in packs, they\u2019re more like casual acquaintances. \n\nI\u2019m the same way with my dog. He\u2019s more sensitive to me, as I can slightly raise my voice and he slinks down and cowers, but another person can scream and he isn\u2019t fazed at all. And I\u2019ve never once hit him and I don\u2019t yell at him ever. I think it\u2019s just our relationship that it affects him more. Positive reinforcement goes a long way. I posted a video to a training group asking a question about something I did (I taught my dog to speak by using another dog who knew the cue and having my dog watch what the other dog did and get a treat so he\u2019d copy him), and I got a few comments how his tail wagged the ENTIRE video. I ask him to do things nicely, and he complies if you give him a moment to think and he knows what you\u2019re asking. I\u2019ve never had to dominate a dog in 20 years. Not to mention that stuff is dangerous, and that\u2019s how a lot of dogs turn aggressive, by being flipped over in an alpha roll or being forced into positions. Ask any dog trainer in the military from maybe 20 years ago how many bites they received and what they were doing.",

I just finished doing a Bear upgrade on a Prusa MK3. Those in my opinion are some of the best printers out there. My SB has been playing with researching printing things with TPU (the flexible filaments). They are a pain in the ass in comparison to the standard PLA and PETG plastics. She's committed to teaching me when she figures it all out :-)\n\n> Have you used Sculptris before?\n\nNope. haven't heard of that actually. I've been knee-deep in Fusion 360 and all the tutorials for that software. It is utterly amazing! I had started with OpenSCAD - which is pretty cool actually in that you make the stuff basically with straight code - but still prefer Fusion 360 for designing things now. The output from it can either go to the 3D printer via the slicer, or to my CNC if what I'm making calls for milling.",

                    "body": "The first one is on the right track. The main idea behind it is that in a dog\u2019s life, they get to choose very little. Choice and control are major reinforcers for dogs. I\u2019ve seen this done mainly with handling and husbandry practices. I think we all know that dog who HATES his nails trimmed. Consent is basically allowing your dog to walk away at any time. Yes, we need to trim the nails. Normally what happens is the dog is put in a muzzle and restrained. That is extremely aversive and traumatic to a dog and causes more discomfort and the dog tries to escalate his behavior to make it stop. But if we slowly recondition the dog, and allow the dog that choice to walk away, they often become a lot more likely to stay there or will come back after they\u2019ve settled down, and they will stop biting and growling since they know they can walk away.\n\nI\u2019ve also seen an example where the dog went to work with the owner every day, but one day the dog didn\u2019t come to the door and stayed in her crate. The owner didn\u2019t force her out and take her to work anyway, she left her there and gave her a break for the day. The next day, the dog bounced to the door and went to work like usual. Like humans, dogs have their off days too, and by forcing that dog to go to work when they were trying to express that they didn\u2019t feel like it, it could have led to a bad day for both involved. Maybe the dog may have been grumpy that day and caused stress on the owner, maybe something else would have happened. By giving that dog the choice, you let her have some more control in her life, and many say that it leads to better communication between dog and handler.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever heard of Puppy Culture, you\u2019ve likely heard of manding. Puppy Culture is known to produce confident, well-adjusted puppies and adult dogs. They\u2019re extraordinary in many things, and I\u2019d love to have more experience with it. I\u2019d attribute this largely to the teaching of manding. Many trainers teach that the dog has to sit to be petted or given a treat. That\u2019s not what manding is at all. Most PC breeders use a sit as their manding behavior, as that\u2019s the most obvious to people, but it can be any behavior. Manding is simply teaching the dog to communicate their needs to the humans. Allowing that puppy to express \u201cHey, I want something.\u201d gives them a lot more confidence and resilience than dogs who are not given that communication at all. \n\nIt\u2019s often related to giving you the words \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d in a language and then sending you to another country. Without those two main words, you\u2019d probably be extremely insecure and unsure of what\u2019s going on. But if you have those words to communicate your wants, then you\u2019ll be a lot more relaxed and confident in the country.\n\nI\u2019m by no means an expert, but if you\u2019re interested if highly recommend looking it up for better information. I may have said some things in a confusing way, as I\u2019m still learning about it myself. But it\u2019s effects on dogs is pretty immense and can benefit both canine and handler. It\u2019s all about communication and listening to one another.",

(can't think of the word I wanted) from others opinions is that I don't 'dominate' my dogs enough.. Namely that I ask my girls to do something nicely (with a please) and give them a moment to respond before I change tone/get snappy... Apparently everyone finds me weird for doing that, but more times than not they will do what they're asked nicely and I have no need to repeat myself in a more domineering way...

And the kicker is, dominance as it is used by compulsion trainers and dominance trainers (*cough cough Cesar Millan*) has been debunked for DECADES... by the same guy who COINED IT. He has begged the scientific community to redact the study for inaccuracy but people still use it. And dogs aren\u2019t wolves! Studies done on packs of stray dogs in other areas especially Easter Europe show that dog packs do not work like wolf packs. Wolf packs are solely family structures, no Alpha wolf in sight. Dog packs are way looser and they take turns being in charge. And they don\u2019t stay in packs, they\u2019re more like casual acquaintances. \n\nI\u2019m the same way with my dog. He\u2019s more sensitive to me, as I can slightly raise my voice and he slinks down and cowers, but another person can scream and he isn\u2019t fazed at all. And I\u2019ve never once hit him and I don\u2019t yell at him ever. I think it\u2019s just our relationship that it affects him more. Positive reinforcement goes a long way. I posted a video to a training group asking a question about something I did (I taught my dog to speak by using another dog who knew the cue and having my dog watch what the other dog did and get a treat so he\u2019d copy him), and I got a few comments how his tail wagged the ENTIRE video. I ask him to do things nicely, and he complies if you give him a moment to think and he knows what you\u2019re asking. I\u2019ve never had to dominate a dog in 20 years. Not to mention that stuff is dangerous, and that\u2019s how a lot of dogs turn aggressive, by being flipped over in an alpha roll or being forced into positions. Ask any dog trainer in the military from maybe 20 years ago how many bites they received and what they were doing.",

I just finished doing a Bear upgrade on a Prusa MK3. Those in my opinion are some of the best printers out there. My SB has been playing with researching printing things with TPU (the flexible filaments). They are a pain in the ass in comparison to the standard PLA and PETG plastics. She's committed to teaching me when she figures it all out :-)\n\n> Have you used Sculptris before?\n\nNope. haven't heard of that actually. I've been knee-deep in Fusion 360 and all the tutorials for that software. It is utterly amazing! I had started with OpenSCAD - which is pretty cool actually in that you make the stuff basically with straight code - but still prefer Fusion 360 for designing things now. The output from it can either go to the 3D printer via the slicer, or to my CNC if what I'm making calls for milling.",

            "body": "The first one is on the right track. The main idea behind it is that in a dog\u2019s life, they get to choose very little. Choice and control are major reinforcers for dogs. I\u2019ve seen this done mainly with handling and husbandry practices. I think we all know that dog who HATES his nails trimmed. Consent is basically allowing your dog to walk away at any time. Yes, we need to trim the nails. Normally what happens is the dog is put in a muzzle and restrained. That is extremely aversive and traumatic to a dog and causes more discomfort and the dog tries to escalate his behavior to make it stop. But if we slowly recondition the dog, and allow the dog that choice to walk away, they often become a lot more likely to stay there or will come back after they\u2019ve settled down, and they will stop biting and growling since they know they can walk away.\n\nI\u2019ve also seen an example where the dog went to work with the owner every day, but one day the dog didn\u2019t come to the door and stayed in her crate. The owner didn\u2019t force her out and take her to work anyway, she left her there and gave her a break for the day. The next day, the dog bounced to the door and went to work like usual. Like humans, dogs have their off days too, and by forcing that dog to go to work when they were trying to express that they didn\u2019t feel like it, it could have led to a bad day for both involved. Maybe the dog may have been grumpy that day and caused stress on the owner, maybe something else would have happened. By giving that dog the choice, you let her have some more control in her life, and many say that it leads to better communication between dog and handler.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever heard of Puppy Culture, you\u2019ve likely heard of manding. Puppy Culture is known to produce confident, well-adjusted puppies and adult dogs. They\u2019re extraordinary in many things, and I\u2019d love to have more experience with it. I\u2019d attribute this largely to the teaching of manding. Many trainers teach that the dog has to sit to be petted or given a treat. That\u2019s not what manding is at all. Most PC breeders use a sit as their manding behavior, as that\u2019s the most obvious to people, but it can be any behavior. Manding is simply teaching the dog to communicate their needs to the humans. Allowing that puppy to express \u201cHey, I want something.\u201d gives them a lot more confidence and resilience than dogs who are not given that communication at all. \n\nIt\u2019s often related to giving you the words \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d in a language and then sending you to another country. Without those two main words, you\u2019d probably be extremely insecure and unsure of what\u2019s going on. But if you have those words to communicate your wants, then you\u2019ll be a lot more relaxed and confident in the country.\n\nI\u2019m by no means an expert, but if you\u2019re interested if highly recommend looking it up for better information. I may have said some things in a confusing way, as I\u2019m still learning about it myself. But it\u2019s effects on dogs is pretty immense and can benefit both canine and handler. It\u2019s all about communication and listening to one another.",

(can't think of the word I wanted) from others opinions is that I don't 'dominate' my dogs enough.. Namely that I ask my girls to do something nicely (with a please) and give them a moment to respond before I change tone/get snappy... Apparently everyone finds me weird for doing that, but more times than not they will do what they're asked nicely and I have no need to repeat myself in a more domineering way...

And the kicker is, dominance as it is used by compulsion trainers and dominance trainers (*cough cough Cesar Millan*) has been debunked for DECADES... by the same guy who COINED IT. He has begged the scientific community to redact the study for inaccuracy but people still use it. And dogs aren\u2019t wolves! Studies done on packs of stray dogs in other areas especially Easter Europe show that dog packs do not work like wolf packs. Wolf packs are solely family structures, no Alpha wolf in sight. Dog packs are way looser and they take turns being in charge. And they don\u2019t stay in packs, they\u2019re more like casual acquaintances. \n\nI\u2019m the same way with my dog. He\u2019s more sensitive to me, as I can slightly raise my voice and he slinks down and cowers, but another person can scream and he isn\u2019t fazed at all. And I\u2019ve never once hit him and I don\u2019t yell at him ever. I think it\u2019s just our relationship that it affects him more. Positive reinforcement goes a long way. I posted a video to a training group asking a question about something I did (I taught my dog to speak by using another dog who knew the cue and having my dog watch what the other dog did and get a treat so he\u2019d copy him), and I got a few comments how his tail wagged the ENTIRE video. I ask him to do things nicely, and he complies if you give him a moment to think and he knows what you\u2019re asking. I\u2019ve never had to dominate a dog in 20 years. Not to mention that stuff is dangerous, and that\u2019s how a lot of dogs turn aggressive, by being flipped over in an alpha roll or being forced into positions. Ask any dog trainer in the military from maybe 20 years ago how many bites they received and what they were doing.",

I just finished doing a Bear upgrade on a Prusa MK3. Those in my opinion are some of the best printers out there. My SB has been playing with researching printing things with TPU (the flexible filaments). They are a pain in the ass in comparison to the standard PLA and PETG plastics.

I've been knee-deep in Fusion 360 and all the tutorials for that software. It is utterly amazing! I had started with OpenSCAD - which is pretty cool actually in that you make the stuff basically with straight code - but still prefer Fusion 360 for designing things now. The output from it can either go to the 3D printer via the slicer, or to my CNC if what I'm making calls for milling.",

I can cobble up functional piece things in Fusion 360 and other software, and tune printers/cnc/lathe stuff - but as to sculpting something? \n\nMe trying to sculpt would look like some grown man that took a full hit of acid and started sculpting a masterpiece with raw materials.

And the kicker is, dominance as it is used by compulsion trainers and dominance trainers (*cough cough Cesar Millan*) has been debunked for DECADES... by the same guy who COINED IT. He has begged the scientific community to redact the study for inaccuracy but people still use it. And dogs aren\u2019t wolves! Studies done on packs of stray dogs in other areas especially Easter Europe show that dog packs do not work like wolf packs. Wolf packs are solely family structures, no Alpha wolf in sight. Dog packs are way looser and they take turns being in charge. And they don\u2019t stay in packs, they\u2019re more like casual acquaintances. \n\nI\u2019m the same way with my dog.

I tried the pepper trick but it had no impact.. \n\nLast time they got out it took me 8 hours of nonstop searching to find and secure the eldest as she won't let anyone but me catch her.. German shepherd cross so she has mad wanderlust, nil sense of direction, and anxiety of other people due to maltreatment from her previous owners... She legs it and then panics that she's out and doesn't stop sprinting..  Doesn't make for an easy retrieval! The youngest (who I've been the only owner of) on the other hand was caught within minutes as she made friends with a stranger \ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude02",

If I ever go into it I'll rely on a friends partner to correlate the setup and programs for me \ud83d\ude1b\n\nI haven't tried sculpting before as I didn't have the space to make mess n didn't want to risk someone else's oven haha.. Watched a doco on Netflix \"Struggle: The Life and Lost Art of Szukalski\" and realised one could use plaster of paris for both sculpt and carve  techniques without the need to cook/fire it :) \n\nSo far I've just started with some horse/dragon type armatures out of wire/tin foil and set to begin the plastering over the next week :)\n\nAs for LSD.. I have met plenty of people over the years who would do just that and feel they are wicked artists for abstract finger paintings \ud83d\ude02",
