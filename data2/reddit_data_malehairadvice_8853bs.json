Like wrapping extension cords or power cords of any kind, don't do it tight and don't fold over. It leads to breakage. The more you bend or fold anything, the more you stress it. It's not much in this instance, I'll give you that. Im just salty cuz i had a rough night. Guess i was lookin for a fight. To each their own I guess. Good luck and good hair to everyone. ",

I'm sure there's plenty of good natured men with buns. But I assume they do it for looks, as a ponytail solves the physical problem of having long hair getting in the way of life- in my eyes.

A bun is a style for looks, not practicality. Keep those downvotes comin. Manbuns are stupid. Aside from looking dumb, they put undue stress on the hair. Fuck me for having my own opinion and taste.

You better better believe i disagree a lot. But we're all cool. I didn't flat out say guys with buns are wrong, or to not be respected. That's why u/nathanpaulyoung was cool with me earlier.  I'm sure there's plenty of good natured men with buns. But I assume they do it for looks, as a ponytail solves the physical problem of having long hair getting in the way of life- in my eyes.

Those are my life experiences. Period. Also, i can disagree with someone and still not categorize or look down upon them. I work at a bar. I meet all kinds, every day. You better better believe i disagree a lot. But we're all cool. I didn't flat out say guys with buns are wrong, or to not be respected. That's why u/nathanpaulyoung was cool with me earlier.  I'm sure there's plenty of good natured men with buns. But I assume they do it for looks, as a ponytail solves the physical problem of having long hair getting in the way of life- in my eyes. And if that makes me an asshole, then eat me. Cuz that's in right now.",

I'm sure there's plenty of good natured men with buns. But I assume they do it for looks, as a ponytail solves the physical problem of having long hair getting in the way of life- in my eyes.
