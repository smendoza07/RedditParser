You'll want something with a bit of body and height. Basically, you don't want your hair to look \"small\" compared to the rest of your head. This effect is greatly exaggerated if your face/head are bottom-heavy (ie if your chin is really wide compared to  your hairline and top of your head.). When I was 75 pounds heavier I had a short cut that I combed into sort of a classic side part/slightly pompodour-ish look, and it was terrible on me because my face had so much real estate and my hair didn't balance it out. After dropping the weight I tried again and it looked a lot better because there was less contrast between my face and hair. It still looked better with more length on top though, and I feel like I might have been able to pull it off when I was heavier if I hadn't gotten it cut so short. \n\nMaybe check out some of the following for some inspiration (Which I've conveniently taken from the OP's album). I've seen similar cuts work really well on bigger dudes. Just keep in mind that, like I said earlier, it's hard to answer without more information.  \n[One](http://i.imgur.com/EpeXkk2.jpg)  \n[Two](http://i.imgur.com/GIHUE3O.jpg)  \n[Three](http://i.imgur.com/grDk03a.jpg)  ",

You'll want something with a bit of body and height. Basically, you don't want your hair to look \"small\" compared to the rest of your head. This effect is greatly exaggerated if your face/head are bottom-heavy (ie if your chin is really wide compared to  your hairline and top of your head.). When I was 75 pounds heavier I had a short cut that I combed into sort of a classic side part/slightly pompodour-ish look, and it was terrible on me because my face had so much real estate and my hair didn't balance it out. After dropping the weight I tried again and it looked a lot better because there was less contrast between my face and hair. It still looked better with more length on top though, and I feel like I might have been able to pull it off when I was heavier if I hadn't gotten it cut so short. \n\nMaybe check out some of the following for some inspiration (Which I've conveniently taken from the OP's album). I've seen similar cuts work really well on bigger dudes. Just keep in mind that, like I said earlier, it's hard to answer without more information.  \n[One](http://i.imgur.com/EpeXkk2.jpg)  \n[Two](http://i.imgur.com/GIHUE3O.jpg)  \n[Three](http://i.imgur.com/grDk03a.jpg)  ",

You'll want something with a bit of body and height. Basically, you don't want your hair to look \"small\" compared to the rest of your head. This effect is greatly exaggerated if your face/head are bottom-heavy (ie if your chin is really wide compared to  your hairline and top of your head.). When I was 75 pounds heavier I had a short cut that I combed into sort of a classic side part/slightly pompodour-ish look, and it was terrible on me because my face had so much real estate and my hair didn't balance it out. After dropping the weight I tried again and it looked a lot better because there was less contrast between my face and hair. It still looked better with more length on top though, and I feel like I might have been able to pull it off when I was heavier if I hadn't gotten it cut so short. \n\nMaybe check out some of the following for some inspiration (Which I've conveniently taken from the OP's album). I've seen similar cuts work really well on bigger dudes. Just keep in mind that, like I said earlier, it's hard to answer without more information.  \n[One](http://i.imgur.com/EpeXkk2.jpg)  \n[Two](http://i.imgur.com/GIHUE3O.jpg)  \n[Three](http://i.imgur.com/grDk03a.jpg)  ",

You'll want something with a bit of body and height. Basically, you don't want your hair to look \"small\" compared to the rest of your head. This effect is greatly exaggerated if your face/head are bottom-heavy (ie if your chin is really wide compared to  your hairline and top of your head.). When I was 75 pounds heavier I had a short cut that I combed into sort of a classic side part/slightly pompodour-ish look, and it was terrible on me because my face had so much real estate and my hair didn't balance it out. After dropping the weight I tried again and it looked a lot better because there was less contrast between my face and hair. It still looked better with more length on top though, and I feel like I might have been able to pull it off when I was heavier if I hadn't gotten it cut so short. \n\nMaybe check out some of the following for some inspiration (Which I've conveniently taken from the OP's album). I've seen similar cuts work really well on bigger dudes. Just keep in mind that, like I said earlier, it's hard to answer without more information.  \n[One](http://i.imgur.com/EpeXkk2.jpg)  \n[Two](http://i.imgur.com/GIHUE3O.jpg)  \n[Three](http://i.imgur.com/grDk03a.jpg)  ",

You'll want something with a bit of body and height. Basically, you don't want your hair to look \"small\" compared to the rest of your head. This effect is greatly exaggerated if your face/head are bottom-heavy (ie if your chin is really wide compared to  your hairline and top of your head.). When I was 75 pounds heavier I had a short cut that I combed into sort of a classic side part/slightly pompodour-ish look, and it was terrible on me because my face had so much real estate and my hair didn't balance it out. After dropping the weight I tried again and it looked a lot better because there was less contrast between my face and hair. It still looked better with more length on top though, and I feel like I might have been able to pull it off when I was heavier if I hadn't gotten it cut so short. \n\nMaybe check out some of the following for some inspiration (Which I've conveniently taken from the OP's album). I've seen similar cuts work really well on bigger dudes. Just keep in mind that, like I said earlier, it's hard to answer without more information.  \n[One](http://i.imgur.com/EpeXkk2.jpg)  \n[Two](http://i.imgur.com/GIHUE3O.jpg)  \n[Three](http://i.imgur.com/grDk03a.jpg)  ",
