    "body": "So I accidentally freestyled last night and wanted to share the story with my favorite Sugar Cubes. \n\nLast night I went to see Tool at the SKC. We had gotten really good seats, like 2nd row off the floor. (Also it was an amazing visual show if you are into them at all, tons of lasers, super cool)  The couple in the seats directly in front of us were in my opinion clearly a sugar couple. He was way too well dressed for this particular show and also seemed vaguely uninterested in everything but his date's ass. I do not blame him, it was spectacular.  Anyway, he was also at least in his 60s and she looked to be 28-30ish and a knockout. She was interacting with him but she was very into the music. By this time I had spent an hour making up a whole sugar story for them in my head because that's what I do while I'm in public. I just create backstories for everyone around me.  \n\nAgain, just my opinion. Don't jump my ass for making a judgment call, I see sugar everywhere lol \n\nSo toward the end of the concert, there is a 10-minute intermission and this lady gets up to use the bathroom or whatever and I guess she knocked her coat off the back of her seat. I noticed it and picked it up and draped it on the back of her seat and the guy said well thank you, aren't you sweet.\n\nY'all I looked right in that man's eyes and said \"Just like sugar\" and winked. \n\nI wish you could have seen the look on this man's face.  He almost blushed but got this super wide grin and kinda chuckled.\n\nLook he might not have known what I was talking about, but I'd like to imagine he did. He also gave me his card after chatting for a few minutes with no real explanation. His date came back so I left it alone, but I thought it was hilarious.",

Comparatively to a lot of stories here ive had it relatively easy. I find connection easy, i am a caregiver, i am an optimist with a realist streak and a bit of an undercover wildchild. So for me there are moments when the bowl feels harsh. Usually when people talk about whether or not im good enough, pretty enough, thin enough, young enough etc ad nauseum, to be an sb. \nBut when i think about my real experience, its men that ive loved who have provided things for me because they believed i was worth the investment. Not because i charge them. And because i was an ear, and a companion. So yeah, this subs version of the bowl is taxing. My personal version is much more hopeful and loving.",

Comparatively to a lot of stories here ive had it relatively easy. I find connection easy, i am a caregiver, i am an optimist with a realist streak and a bit of an undercover wildchild. So for me there are moments when the bowl feels harsh. Usually when people talk about whether or not im good enough, pretty enough, thin enough, young enough etc ad nauseum, to be an sb. \nBut when i think about my real experience, its men that ive loved who have provided things for me because they believed i was worth the investment. Not because i charge them. And because i was an ear, and a companion. So yeah, this subs version of the bowl is taxing. My personal version is much more hopeful and loving.",

Comparatively to a lot of stories here ive had it relatively easy. I find connection easy, i am a caregiver, i am an optimist with a realist streak and a bit of an undercover wildchild. So for me there are moments when the bowl feels harsh. Usually when people talk about whether or not im good enough, pretty enough, thin enough, young enough etc ad nauseum, to be an sb. \nBut when i think about my real experience, its men that ive loved who have provided things for me because they believed i was worth the investment. Not because i charge them. And because i was an ear, and a companion. So yeah, this subs version of the bowl is taxing. My personal version is much more hopeful and loving.",

Comparatively to a lot of stories here ive had it relatively easy. I find connection easy, i am a caregiver, i am an optimist with a realist streak and a bit of an undercover wildchild. So for me there are moments when the bowl feels harsh. Usually when people talk about whether or not im good enough, pretty enough, thin enough, young enough etc ad nauseum, to be an sb. \nBut when i think about my real experience, its men that ive loved who have provided things for me because they believed i was worth the investment. Not because i charge them. And because i was an ear, and a companion. So yeah, this subs version of the bowl is taxing. My personal version is much more hopeful and loving.",
