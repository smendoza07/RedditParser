Swollen, hurt. There are several class action lawsuits, my red, with a few dark burns, later scabbed over, upper lip, was nothing compared to some pics I saw, plus it removed my hair..\n\nThere are some made for men dyes for facial hair that are better tha. Just for Men and you can get any colour. Check Amazon, I used one, forget the name, they sold medium ash blond, it was expensive, but lasted forever, I don't bother anymore. Most are left in 5 minutes. \n\nI could use tips, since my methods are expensive and kinda suck!\n\nOP, you look good, and I agree darkening would help. Unfortunately with short hair, blond looks like there is less than there is. My barber cuts my hair longer (for a fade she goes up 0.5 on each clipper, she's known locally as the Queen of Fades) than she would for someone with dark hair, or I'd look bald.  Find someone who can work with light hair.",

It's like $50 for a 6 month supply.\n\nI've been doing it for almost a year now, twice a day putting on a foam solution on my face for four hours a session. When I started I could only grow some hair under my chin and a tiny bit on my cheeks, now I have to trim/shave every week because I actually grow hair all on my cheeks lol I actually have to line it up. Look into the side effects and see if you'll give it a try, I'll probably do one more year to help \"thicken\" what I've grown and then hopefully be done with it. Best of luck!",

Hair is just a little fuzz on the top to keep us warm.\nI really like the clean shaven look you've got going on here.  Enjoy yourself!  Wear a hat when you have to and remember your sunscreen.  (That's mom talk.)\nBut, honestly, when it comes down to it, the decision is yours. Not your mom's, your spouse's, or a bunch of strangers on the internet.  Do what frees your soul to do and be happy.  You look great either way, and besides.... I always looked at a guy's eyes and smile first before I ever noticed the hair!",

And you're pale. Most of this can be fixed. If you lose like 15 lbs your face will look a little leaner and more angular, you can try to keep a constant tan, and the only real fix for the eyebrows is to dye them. The way you looked before was kind of unkempt, now you look like you have a style. So these tips are just ways to really improve and round out that style.",

Swollen, hurt. There are several class action lawsuits, my red, with a few dark burns, later scabbed over, upper lip, was nothing compared to some pics I saw, plus it removed my hair..\n\nThere are some made for men dyes for facial hair that are better tha. Just for Men and you can get any colour. Check Amazon, I used one, forget the name, they sold medium ash blond, it was expensive, but lasted forever, I don't bother anymore. Most are left in 5 minutes. \n\nI could use tips, since my methods are expensive and kinda suck!\n\nOP, you look good, and I agree darkening would help. Unfortunately with short hair, blond looks like there is less than there is. My barber cuts my hair longer (for a fade she goes up 0.5 on each clipper, she's known locally as the Queen of Fades) than she would for someone with dark hair, or I'd look bald.  Find someone who can work with light hair.",

When I started I could only grow some hair under my chin and a tiny bit on my cheeks, now I have to trim/shave every week because I actually grow hair all on my cheeks lol I actually have to line it up. Look into the side effects and see if you'll give it a try, I'll probably do one more year to help \"thicken\" what I've grown and then hopefully be done with it. Best of luck!",

            "body": "I have super light ash blond hair, my facial hair is strawberry blond, but the first bit of it, is light blond, so stubble is super light. \n\nI used to use henna dyes, there are some made for facial hair, but its messy and the colour usually has a red or purple tinge. \n\nThere are also facial hair \"mascara\" type things in many colours that aren't permanent, but are hard to use, get on without painting your face,too, and get all over everything.\n\nJust For Men has blonde dyes but I got chemical burns on my upper lip, even after testing, using it for less time than told (I always use less time for dyes because my hair gets super dyed faster, it sucks in colour, red especially) and exactly as told. Swollen, hurt. There are several class action lawsuits, my red, with a few dark burns, later scabbed over, upper lip, was nothing compared to some pics I saw, plus it removed my hair..\n\nThere are some made for men dyes for facial hair that are better tha. Just for Men and you can get any colour. Check Amazon, I used one, forget the name, they sold medium ash blond, it was expensive, but lasted forever, I don't bother anymore. Most are left in 5 minutes. \n\nI could use tips, since my methods are expensive and kinda suck!\n\nOP, you look good, and I agree darkening would help. Unfortunately with short hair, blond looks like there is less than there is. My barber cuts my hair longer (for a fade she goes up 0.5 on each clipper, she's known locally as the Queen of Fades) than she would for someone with dark hair, or I'd look bald.  Find someone who can work with light hair.",
