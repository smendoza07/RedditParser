    "body": "Edit: To be frank, I started out this morning in not the best head space. I was unpacking 7 months of memories and belongings in an empty apartment wondering what the hell I was going to do to pick myself back up. Now? I feel fine. Not good, but fine, and that\u2019s good enough considering. I am so thankful for this subreddit and all the amazing people that make up the community here. Little internet messages and comments have had so much more of an impact than I anticipated. A little \u201cr/humansbeingbros\u201d moment, if you will \n\nAbout seven months ago I posted in this subreddit about my (22f) sugar relationship with R (M55). I raved about how perfect and kind he was and how we were going to be together forever, and I got absolutely roasted in the comments. You guys told me it wouldn\u2019t last, it was too good to be true. I couldn\u2019t wait to come back here in a year with a big fat \u201cI told you so!\u201d, but here I am - you guys told me so. We ended things. I realized that he didn\u2019t love me; he loved my body, my ability to blend seamlessly with his friends and family, my banter, my youth. He didn\u2019t like my beliefs or values, my family, my friends, my hobbies. He blew up every time I wanted to go anywhere without him. He blew up every time I said no to going anywhere with him. If I didn\u2019t say thank you enough he\u2019d blow up. He didn\u2019t listen when I spoke. Every argument we had he threatened to break up, threatened that things would \u201cescalate\u201d if I wasn\u2019t careful with my words, threw my age in my face, barraged my friends and family. Called me naive. Called my life passions \u201ccute\u201d. I\u2019m mourning a very real love for someone who didn\u2019t even like me. I got to the point where when he was mad, it was exponentially easier to be silent and say sorry, it\u2019s my fault, you\u2019re right. It didn\u2019t matter what it was. I finally stood up for myself last night when staying with him for a week and he told me to get out - threw all my things in a tote, blocked me on everything. I\u2019m back at my apartment now and my furniture is being moved out on Friday because he told me not to lease the furniture again, he\u2019d buy me some. He did. But he won\u2019t give it to me now, so I\u2019ll be sleeping on a mattress until I can save up for some furniture. This has been a hard life lesson that I suppose I needed - I suppose he was right about me being naive. So I\u2019ll be picking up the pieces in the coming months. I\u2019ll listen to Reddit next time.",

The fact that he is 55 and acts like a child is shockingly disgusting. \n\nThreatening to break up with you and blackmail you whenever he is unhappy is a big reflection on his own insecurities as a human being. He knows he isn\u2019t worthy of you and instead of taking the positive route, he belittles you to feel as worthless as he feels about himself. I hope you know that it has nothing to do with you. It is a manipulation tactic to make you feel scared of losing him and his way of molding you to please him in the future. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry you went through all that hurt and trauma but I\u2019m so glad you got out of it. I know the pain hurts but I know you know you\u2019re safe now and that your days ahead are going to get better. I hope you are safe and have supportive people helping you out. Sending you so much love.",

But it wasn\u2019t about what I did, it was about him - not flipping the laundry quick enough, leaving a bag of candy on the counter overnight, my sister canceling on me, my friend\u2019s car leaking some fluid on his driveway. It got to the point where crying every week wasn\u2019t worth it, that\u2019s not love. That\u2019s a tragedy. Thank you for this kind comment, validation is a nice reprieve.",

It felt like us against the odds. Everyone thinks they\u2019re special, right? That\u2019s a human folly we can\u2019t escape. He was cruel to the outside world, physically and verbally confrontational, and he made me feel like I was the single thing in the world that was on his side of the fence. My vanity met his ego and a toxic spill bubbled over. \n\nYou\u2019re right that I\u2019ll recover, but unfortunately I\u2019m sad for him as well as me. He both craves companionship and destroys it. He thought he loved me, and maybe he did to the best of his ability, but it\u2019s not enough for anyone he\u2019ll ever meet. Of that I am certain. Hopefully the tender spot in my heart for him will fade with my love. \n\nThank you for the advice - I think I\u2019ll do that, writing down the lessons I\u2019ve learned. Be better from it. Smarter.

He tried for months after to suck me back in, & at one point said he \u201cloved & missed the way I loved him.\u201d That was when I finally understood that he didn\u2019t love _me_, but he loved how having me around, controlling me, manipulating me, making me abandon friends & family, & making me jump through hoops fed his ego.\n\nI\u2019m awfully sorry you went through this, OP. I know he\u2019s blocked you, but please, please, please also _block him_ & cut off any access of contact he has to you, including cutting off his family & friends too. Narcissists will frequently try to lure you back in. Knowing they still have access to you on _their_ terms & that they can still manipulate you feeds their egos, & they\u2019ll use carrots (like the furniture he\u2019s holding hostage, things you\u2019ve left at his place, money, etc) as excuses to contact or see you. After finally cutting off all contact w/my narcissist ex, he actually started mailing me random items to try to get me to respond to him. A random cheap ring I had left, a makeup pallet, a T-shirt, & when he ran out of things of mine he started mailing me photos of us, notes I had written him, he even mailed me a gift I had given _to him_ once & a photo of him & his daughter. It was demented. But all that\u2019s to say that you need to fortify yourself against when/if he circles back again. He\u2019s already shown you that you\u2019re disposable to him when you no longer fit his needs & feed his ego.\n\nI hope you heal from this, OP. \u2764\ufe0f",

You are attractive enough to be on tv, top 10 percentile.  Not a 7.  That whole sub exist to eat people's self esteem.\n\nNext, dont rush in next relationship.  Be a little more selective next time.  You narrowed to two men too quickly.and only one was a serious contender.\n\nYou are lonely. Maybe try vanilla dating for a bit.  \n\nAlso rebuild your friend network.  Maybe get new roommates or live with other single girls.   Or try hobbies like climbing gym, dancing etc.     I don't think you should live by yourself.

Bad behaviour punished. What a radical idea, right? \nRegarding religions, I\u2019m pretty sure I have clarified before that I am merely talking about ideas, not the believers.

You won\u2019t ever find a huge post from me that spends a solid 50% talking about how successful and accomplished I am for someone to accept my money and give me themselves to cheat on my spouse.

Cheating is considered as a terrible condemnable action by most people. It\u2019s a very basic, widespread justifiable notion of morality. I feel sorry you have trouble grasping those.\n\nRegarding intolerance, I have no reason to be jealous. I quite enjoy my life. I care about others. I probably care more about your wife\u2019s feelings than you, which is quite a disheartening thing to say but that\u2019s what it seems. I see people who suffer at the  hands of scum bags as my brothers and sisters to protect or defend. What can I say, I have quite a visceral reaction to creatures that put humanity to shame especially when they are prideful about being deranged and even seek sympathy and validation from bystanders.",

Regarding your last point. Of course we view the world through our own eyes but he is not an idiot, he knows exactly what he is doing and how it affects others. He just doesn\u2019t care enough to feel guilt (he has said this himself). \n\nI am no psychologist but I think this guy exudes a ton of sociopathic traits: low level emotion, role playing the hero fantasy while having no morals for societal approval, grandiose complex, lack of empathy, seeing people as transactional. Not all anti social disorder people are traitors because they see the value in people and don\u2019t want to leave them if they reap benefit. But his wife doesn\u2019t have that barrier to make him behave. It\u2019s clear that his wife is either trapped or stopped from leaving from other reasons that stop her from following her heart; he loses incentive to be faithful because he can keep disrespecting her and she can\u2019t leave and he has such lack of empathy that the immorality of the act and hurting her is not enough to make him stop. \nHe is a very low emotion person trying to achieve some sort of highs regardless of the impact it has on others. Absolutely despicable. These types of people are the scum of the earth.",

I think baby boomers can be very difficult to deal with because they are so behind the times vs gen Xers they are not as receptive to new ideas.  It depends on personality too, I've met some quite smart and open minded boomers that can easily adapt and get along with younger folks very well.\n\nJust because your SD gives you all the resources and respect the 1st few weeks doesn't mean it will be rosy until you go through life and see if your puzzle pieces fit his.",

But when he was cruel and I tried to talk about it, those things were leveraged: \u201cI would suggest you don\u2019t even attempt to say I don\u2019t do things for you, remember x y z?\u201d It made me feel like I was being ungrateful. If he promised a trip to Paris, canceled last minute for the millionth time, and we went to Florida instead, I couldn\u2019t bring it up or I was an ungrateful brat. If he called me a name, I couldn\u2019t bring it up or I was being ungrateful for the breakfast he made me. And so on. Quite the mindfuck",

My vanity met his ego and a toxic spill bubbled over. \n\nYou\u2019re right that I\u2019ll recover, but unfortunately I\u2019m sad for him as well as me. He both craves companionship and destroys it.

He tried for months after to suck me back in, & at one point said he \u201cloved & missed the way I loved him.\u201d That was when I finally understood that he didn\u2019t love _me_, but he loved how having me around, controlling me, manipulating me, making me abandon friends & family, & making me jump through hoops fed his ego.\n\nI\u2019m awfully sorry you went through this, OP. I know he\u2019s blocked you, but please, please, please also _block him_ & cut off any access of contact he has to you, including cutting off his family & friends too. Narcissists will frequently try to lure you back in. Knowing they still have access to you on _their_ terms & that they can still manipulate you feeds their egos, & they\u2019ll use carrots (like the furniture he\u2019s holding hostage, things you\u2019ve left at his place, money, etc) as excuses to contact or see you. After finally cutting off all contact w/my narcissist ex, he actually started mailing me random items to try to get me to respond to him. A random cheap ring I had left, a makeup pallet, a T-shirt, & when he ran out of things of mine he started mailing me photos of us, notes I had written him, he even mailed me a gift I had given _to him_ once & a photo of him & his daughter. It was demented. But all that\u2019s to say that you need to fortify yourself against when/if he circles back again.

But if I really sit down and think about it you might be right. Not every day you realize something new about yourself. I think I really needed to read what you\u2019ve written; I have to take some time for myself. I don\u2019t like being alone with me, but maybe that\u2019s what I need to get comfortable with. I am the only one in the world that can give me what I want and need. Thank you again.",

I cannot compute how such a messed human being thinks they have so much to brag about after doing such things to their closest people. You play the knight hero character for appearances while being Satan to your wife. Your self characterisation is just that: self characterisation; not reality. You seek vertical relationships to feel superior, needed to negate the fact that any women that would chose a serial cheater has incredibly low standards for a man.

Cheating is considered as a terrible condemnable action by most people. It\u2019s a very basic, widespread justifiable notion of morality. I feel sorry you have trouble grasping those.\n\nRegarding intolerance, I have no reason to be jealous. I quite enjoy my life. I care about others. I probably care more about your wife\u2019s feelings than you, which is quite a disheartening thing to say but that\u2019s what it seems. I see people who suffer at the  hands of scum bags as my brothers and sisters to protect or defend. What can I say, I have quite a visceral reaction to creatures that put humanity to shame especially when they are prideful about being deranged and even seek sympathy and validation from bystanders.",

Regarding your last point. Of course we view the world through our own eyes but he is not an idiot, he knows exactly what he is doing and how it affects others. He just doesn\u2019t care enough to feel guilt (he has said this himself). \n\nI am no psychologist but I think this guy exudes a ton of sociopathic traits: low level emotion, role playing the hero fantasy while having no morals for societal approval, grandiose complex, lack of empathy, seeing people as transactional. Not all anti social disorder people are traitors because they see the value in people and don\u2019t want to leave them if they reap benefit. But his wife doesn\u2019t have that barrier to make him behave. It\u2019s clear that his wife is either trapped or stopped from leaving from other reasons that stop her from following her heart; he loses incentive to be faithful because he can keep disrespecting her and she can\u2019t leave and he has such lack of empathy that the immorality of the act and hurting her is not enough to make him stop. \nHe is a very low emotion person trying to achieve some sort of highs regardless of the impact it has on others. Absolutely despicable. These types of people are the scum of the earth.",

It takes learning and knowing when to know 'enough is enough' vs 'hope springs eternal'. It is a massive waste of time to try to understand people like that.\n\nWell done to you for getting out and as you said, it is a lesson. It is a good lesson and you are still young. Just never make that mistake again because people like that NEVER, EVER change and life is too short for all the drama. \n\nUpwards and onwards!",

                    "body": ">> He never loved you. He's a narcissist. He is incapable of it.\n\nThis to the core. I was in a relationship w/a narcissist years ago. He tried for months after to suck me back in, & at one point said he \u201cloved & missed the way I loved him.\u201d That was when I finally understood that he didn\u2019t love _me_, but he loved how having me around, controlling me, manipulating me, making me abandon friends & family, & making me jump through hoops fed his ego.\n\nI\u2019m awfully sorry you went through this, OP. I know he\u2019s blocked you, but please, please, please also _block him_ & cut off any access of contact he has to you, including cutting off his family & friends too. Narcissists will frequently try to lure you back in. Knowing they still have access to you on _their_ terms & that they can still manipulate you feeds their egos, & they\u2019ll use carrots (like the furniture he\u2019s holding hostage, things you\u2019ve left at his place, money, etc) as excuses to contact or see you. After finally cutting off all contact w/my narcissist ex, he actually started mailing me random items to try to get me to respond to him. A random cheap ring I had left, a makeup pallet, a T-shirt, & when he ran out of things of mine he started mailing me photos of us, notes I had written him, he even mailed me a gift I had given _to him_ once & a photo of him & his daughter. It was demented. But all that\u2019s to say that you need to fortify yourself against when/if he circles back again. He\u2019s already shown you that you\u2019re disposable to him when you no longer fit his needs & feed his ego.\n\nI hope you heal from this, OP. \u2764\ufe0f",

I cannot compute how such a messed human being thinks they have so much to brag about after doing such things to their closest people. You play the knight hero character for appearances while being Satan to your wife. Your self characterisation is just that: self characterisation; not reality.

I feel sorry you have trouble grasping those.\n\nRegarding intolerance, I have no reason to be jealous. I quite enjoy my life. I care about others. I probably care more about your wife\u2019s feelings than you, which is quite a disheartening thing to say but that\u2019s what it seems. I see people who suffer at the  hands of scum bags as my brothers and sisters to protect or defend. What can I say, I have quite a visceral reaction to creatures that put humanity to shame especially when they are prideful about being deranged and even seek sympathy and validation from bystanders.",

He just doesn\u2019t care enough to feel guilt (he has said this himself). \n\nI am no psychologist but I think this guy exudes a ton of sociopathic traits: low level emotion, role playing the hero fantasy while having no morals for societal approval, grandiose complex, lack of empathy, seeing people as transactional. Not all anti social disorder people are traitors because they see the value in people and don\u2019t want to leave them if they reap benefit. But his wife doesn\u2019t have that barrier to make him behave. It\u2019s clear that his wife is either trapped or stopped from leaving from other reasons that stop her from following her heart; he loses incentive to be faithful because he can keep disrespecting her and she can\u2019t leave and he has such lack of empathy that the immorality of the act and hurting her is not enough to make him stop. \nHe is a very low emotion person trying to achieve some sort of highs regardless of the impact it has on others. Absolutely despicable. These types of people are the scum of the earth.",

He tried for months after to suck me back in, & at one point said he \u201cloved & missed the way I loved him.\u201d That was when I finally understood that he didn\u2019t love _me_, but he loved how having me around, controlling me, manipulating me, making me abandon friends & family, & making me jump through hoops fed his ego.\n\nI\u2019m awfully sorry you went through this, OP. I know he\u2019s blocked you, but please, please, please also _block him_ & cut off any access of contact he has to you, including cutting off his family & friends too. Narcissists will frequently try to lure you back in. Knowing they still have access to you on _their_ terms & that they can still manipulate you feeds their egos, & they\u2019ll use carrots (like the furniture he\u2019s holding hostage, things you\u2019ve left at his place, money, etc) as excuses to contact or see you. After finally cutting off all contact w/my narcissist ex, he actually started mailing me random items to try to get me to respond to him. A random cheap ring I had left, a makeup pallet, a T-shirt, & when he ran out of things of mine he started mailing me photos of us, notes I had written him, he even mailed me a gift I had given _to him_ once & a photo of him & his daughter. It was demented. But all that\u2019s to say that you need to fortify yourself against when/if he circles back again. He\u2019s already shown you that you\u2019re disposable to him when you no longer fit his needs & feed his ego.\n\nI hope you heal from this, OP. \u2764\ufe0f",

Cheating is considered as a terrible condemnable action by most people. It\u2019s a very basic, widespread justifiable notion of morality. I feel sorry you have trouble grasping those.\n\nRegarding intolerance, I have no reason to be jealous. I quite enjoy my life. I care about others. I probably care more about your wife\u2019s feelings than you, which is quite a disheartening thing to say but that\u2019s what it seems. I see people who suffer at the  hands of scum bags as my brothers and sisters to protect or defend. What can I say, I have quite a visceral reaction to creatures that put humanity to shame especially when they are prideful about being deranged and even seek sympathy and validation from bystanders.",

Regarding your last point. Of course we view the world through our own eyes but he is not an idiot, he knows exactly what he is doing and how it affects others. He just doesn\u2019t care enough to feel guilt (he has said this himself). \n\nI am no psychologist but I think this guy exudes a ton of sociopathic traits: low level emotion, role playing the hero fantasy while having no morals for societal approval, grandiose complex, lack of empathy, seeing people as transactional. Not all anti social disorder people are traitors because they see the value in people and don\u2019t want to leave them if they reap benefit. But his wife doesn\u2019t have that barrier to make him behave. It\u2019s clear that his wife is either trapped or stopped from leaving from other reasons that stop her from following her heart; he loses incentive to be faithful because he can keep disrespecting her and she can\u2019t leave and he has such lack of empathy that the immorality of the act and hurting her is not enough to make him stop. \nHe is a very low emotion person trying to achieve some sort of highs regardless of the impact it has on others. Absolutely despicable. These types of people are the scum of the earth.",

I cannot compute how such a messed human being thinks they have so much to brag about after doing such things to their closest people. You play the knight hero character for appearances while being Satan to your wife. Your self characterisation is just that: self characterisation; not reality. You seek vertical relationships to feel superior, needed to negate the fact that any women that would chose a serial cheater has incredibly low standards for a man. You\u2019re a decamillionaire but you\u2019re still morally worthless.",

Bad behaviour punished. What a radical idea, right? \nRegarding religions, I\u2019m pretty sure I have clarified before that I am merely talking about ideas, not the believers. For me it\u2019s quite easy to separate both. \n\nRegarding humility, you honestly can\u2019t be serious. You won\u2019t ever find a huge post from me that spends a solid 50% talking about how successful and accomplished I am for someone to accept my money and give me themselves to cheat on my spouse.

I probably care more about your wife\u2019s feelings than you, which is quite a disheartening thing to say but that\u2019s what it seems. I see people who suffer at the  hands of scum bags as my brothers and sisters to protect or defend. What can I say, I have quite a visceral reaction to creatures that put humanity to shame especially when they are prideful about being deranged and even seek sympathy and validation from bystanders.",

Regarding your last point. Of course we view the world through our own eyes but he is not an idiot, he knows exactly what he is doing and how it affects others. He just doesn\u2019t care enough to feel guilt (he has said this himself). \n\nI am no psychologist but I think this guy exudes a ton of sociopathic traits: low level emotion, role playing the hero fantasy while having no morals for societal approval, grandiose complex, lack of empathy, seeing people as transactional. Not all anti social disorder people are traitors because they see the value in people and don\u2019t want to leave them if they reap benefit. But his wife doesn\u2019t have that barrier to make him behave. It\u2019s clear that his wife is either trapped or stopped from leaving from other reasons that stop her from following her heart; he loses incentive to be faithful because he can keep disrespecting her and she can\u2019t leave and he has such lack of empathy that the immorality of the act and hurting her is not enough to make him stop. \nHe is a very low emotion person trying to achieve some sort of highs regardless of the impact it has on others. Absolutely despicable. These types of people are the scum of the earth.",

I cannot compute how such a messed human being thinks they have so much to brag about after doing such things to their closest people.

You seek vertical relationships to feel superior, needed to negate the fact that any women that would chose a serial cheater has incredibly low standards for a man.

I probably care more about your wife\u2019s feelings than you, which is quite a disheartening thing to say but that\u2019s what it seems. I see people who suffer at the  hands of scum bags as my brothers and sisters to protect or defend.

Regarding your last point. Of course we view the world through our own eyes but he is not an idiot, he knows exactly what he is doing and how it affects others. He just doesn\u2019t care enough to feel guilt (he has said this himself). \n\nI am no psychologist but I think this guy exudes a ton of sociopathic traits: low level emotion, role playing the hero fantasy while having no morals for societal approval, grandiose complex, lack of empathy, seeing people as transactional. Not all anti social disorder people are traitors because they see the value in people and don\u2019t want to leave them if they reap benefit. But his wife doesn\u2019t have that barrier to make him behave. It\u2019s clear that his wife is either trapped or stopped from leaving from other reasons that stop her from following her heart; he loses incentive to be faithful because he can keep disrespecting her and she can\u2019t leave and he has such lack of empathy that the immorality of the act and hurting her is not enough to make him stop. \nHe is a very low emotion person trying to achieve some sort of highs regardless of the impact it has on others. Absolutely despicable. These types of people are the scum of the earth.",

Cheating is considered as a terrible condemnable action by most people. It\u2019s a very basic, widespread justifiable notion of morality. I feel sorry you have trouble grasping those.\n\nRegarding intolerance, I have no reason to be jealous. I quite enjoy my life. I care about others. I probably care more about your wife\u2019s feelings than you, which is quite a disheartening thing to say but that\u2019s what it seems. I see people who suffer at the  hands of scum bags as my brothers and sisters to protect or defend. What can I say, I have quite a visceral reaction to creatures that put humanity to shame especially when they are prideful about being deranged and even seek sympathy and validation from bystanders.",

Regarding your last point. Of course we view the world through our own eyes but he is not an idiot, he knows exactly what he is doing and how it affects others. He just doesn\u2019t care enough to feel guilt (he has said this himself). \n\nI am no psychologist but I think this guy exudes a ton of sociopathic traits: low level emotion, role playing the hero fantasy while having no morals for societal approval, grandiose complex, lack of empathy, seeing people as transactional. Not all anti social disorder people are traitors because they see the value in people and don\u2019t want to leave them if they reap benefit. But his wife doesn\u2019t have that barrier to make him behave. It\u2019s clear that his wife is either trapped or stopped from leaving from other reasons that stop her from following her heart; he loses incentive to be faithful because he can keep disrespecting her and she can\u2019t leave and he has such lack of empathy that the immorality of the act and hurting her is not enough to make him stop. \nHe is a very low emotion person trying to achieve some sort of highs regardless of the impact it has on others. Absolutely despicable. These types of people are the scum of the earth.",

You won\u2019t ever find a huge post from me that spends a solid 50% talking about how successful and accomplished I am for someone to accept my money and give me themselves to cheat on my spouse.

Cheating is considered as a terrible condemnable action by most people. It\u2019s a very basic, widespread justifiable notion of morality. I feel sorry you have trouble grasping those.\n\nRegarding intolerance, I have no reason to be jealous. I quite enjoy my life. I care about others. I probably care more about your wife\u2019s feelings than you, which is quite a disheartening thing to say but that\u2019s what it seems. I see people who suffer at the  hands of scum bags as my brothers and sisters to protect or defend. What can I say, I have quite a visceral reaction to creatures that put humanity to shame especially when they are prideful about being deranged and even seek sympathy and validation from bystanders.",

Regarding your last point. Of course we view the world through our own eyes but he is not an idiot, he knows exactly what he is doing and how it affects others. He just doesn\u2019t care enough to feel guilt (he has said this himself). \n\nI am no psychologist but I think this guy exudes a ton of sociopathic traits: low level emotion, role playing the hero fantasy while having no morals for societal approval, grandiose complex, lack of empathy, seeing people as transactional. Not all anti social disorder people are traitors because they see the value in people and don\u2019t want to leave them if they reap benefit. But his wife doesn\u2019t have that barrier to make him behave. It\u2019s clear that his wife is either trapped or stopped from leaving from other reasons that stop her from following her heart; he loses incentive to be faithful because he can keep disrespecting her and she can\u2019t leave and he has such lack of empathy that the immorality of the act and hurting her is not enough to make him stop. \nHe is a very low emotion person trying to achieve some sort of highs regardless of the impact it has on others. Absolutely despicable. These types of people are the scum of the earth.",

Cheating is considered as a terrible condemnable action by most people. It\u2019s a very basic, widespread justifiable notion of morality. I feel sorry you have trouble grasping those.\n\nRegarding intolerance, I have no reason to be jealous. I quite enjoy my life. I care about others. I probably care more about your wife\u2019s feelings than you, which is quite a disheartening thing to say but that\u2019s what it seems. I see people who suffer at the  hands of scum bags as my brothers and sisters to protect or defend. What can I say, I have quite a visceral reaction to creatures that put humanity to shame especially when they are prideful about being deranged and even seek sympathy and validation from bystanders.",

Regarding your last point. Of course we view the world through our own eyes but he is not an idiot, he knows exactly what he is doing and how it affects others. He just doesn\u2019t care enough to feel guilt (he has said this himself). \n\nI am no psychologist but I think this guy exudes a ton of sociopathic traits: low level emotion, role playing the hero fantasy while having no morals for societal approval, grandiose complex, lack of empathy, seeing people as transactional. Not all anti social disorder people are traitors because they see the value in people and don\u2019t want to leave them if they reap benefit. But his wife doesn\u2019t have that barrier to make him behave. It\u2019s clear that his wife is either trapped or stopped from leaving from other reasons that stop her from following her heart; he loses incentive to be faithful because he can keep disrespecting her and she can\u2019t leave and he has such lack of empathy that the immorality of the act and hurting her is not enough to make him stop. \nHe is a very low emotion person trying to achieve some sort of highs regardless of the impact it has on others. Absolutely despicable. These types of people are the scum of the earth.",

Cheating is considered as a terrible condemnable action by most people. It\u2019s a very basic, widespread justifiable notion of morality. I feel sorry you have trouble grasping those.\n\nRegarding intolerance, I have no reason to be jealous. I quite enjoy my life. I care about others. I probably care more about your wife\u2019s feelings than you, which is quite a disheartening thing to say but that\u2019s what it seems. I see people who suffer at the  hands of scum bags as my brothers and sisters to protect or defend. What can I say, I have quite a visceral reaction to creatures that put humanity to shame especially when they are prideful about being deranged and even seek sympathy and validation from bystanders.",

Regarding your last point. Of course we view the world through our own eyes but he is not an idiot, he knows exactly what he is doing and how it affects others. He just doesn\u2019t care enough to feel guilt (he has said this himself). \n\nI am no psychologist but I think this guy exudes a ton of sociopathic traits: low level emotion, role playing the hero fantasy while having no morals for societal approval, grandiose complex, lack of empathy, seeing people as transactional. Not all anti social disorder people are traitors because they see the value in people and don\u2019t want to leave them if they reap benefit. But his wife doesn\u2019t have that barrier to make him behave. It\u2019s clear that his wife is either trapped or stopped from leaving from other reasons that stop her from following her heart; he loses incentive to be faithful because he can keep disrespecting her and she can\u2019t leave and he has such lack of empathy that the immorality of the act and hurting her is not enough to make him stop. \nHe is a very low emotion person trying to achieve some sort of highs regardless of the impact it has on others. Absolutely despicable. These types of people are the scum of the earth.",

For me it\u2019s quite easy to separate both. \n\nRegarding humility, you honestly can\u2019t be serious. You won\u2019t ever find a huge post from me that spends a solid 50% talking about how successful and accomplished I am for someone to accept my money and give me themselves to cheat on my spouse.

Cheating is considered as a terrible condemnable action by most people. It\u2019s a very basic, widespread justifiable notion of morality. I feel sorry you have trouble grasping those.\n\nRegarding intolerance, I have no reason to be jealous. I quite enjoy my life. I care about others. I probably care more about your wife\u2019s feelings than you, which is quite a disheartening thing to say but that\u2019s what it seems. I see people who suffer at the  hands of scum bags as my brothers and sisters to protect or defend. What can I say, I have quite a visceral reaction to creatures that put humanity to shame especially when they are prideful about being deranged and even seek sympathy and validation from bystanders.",

Regarding your last point. Of course we view the world through our own eyes but he is not an idiot, he knows exactly what he is doing and how it affects others. He just doesn\u2019t care enough to feel guilt (he has said this himself). \n\nI am no psychologist but I think this guy exudes a ton of sociopathic traits: low level emotion, role playing the hero fantasy while having no morals for societal approval, grandiose complex, lack of empathy, seeing people as transactional. Not all anti social disorder people are traitors because they see the value in people and don\u2019t want to leave them if they reap benefit. But his wife doesn\u2019t have that barrier to make him behave. It\u2019s clear that his wife is either trapped or stopped from leaving from other reasons that stop her from following her heart; he loses incentive to be faithful because he can keep disrespecting her and she can\u2019t leave and he has such lack of empathy that the immorality of the act and hurting her is not enough to make him stop. \nHe is a very low emotion person trying to achieve some sort of highs regardless of the impact it has on others. Absolutely despicable. These types of people are the scum of the earth.",

You won\u2019t ever find a huge post from me that spends a solid 50% talking about how successful and accomplished I am for someone to accept my money and give me themselves to cheat on my spouse.

I probably care more about your wife\u2019s feelings than you, which is quite a disheartening thing to say but that\u2019s what it seems. I see people who suffer at the  hands of scum bags as my brothers and sisters to protect or defend.

Regarding your last point. Of course we view the world through our own eyes but he is not an idiot, he knows exactly what he is doing and how it affects others. He just doesn\u2019t care enough to feel guilt (he has said this himself). \n\nI am no psychologist but I think this guy exudes a ton of sociopathic traits: low level emotion, role playing the hero fantasy while having no morals for societal approval, grandiose complex, lack of empathy, seeing people as transactional. Not all anti social disorder people are traitors because they see the value in people and don\u2019t want to leave them if they reap benefit. But his wife doesn\u2019t have that barrier to make him behave. It\u2019s clear that his wife is either trapped or stopped from leaving from other reasons that stop her from following her heart; he loses incentive to be faithful because he can keep disrespecting her and she can\u2019t leave and he has such lack of empathy that the immorality of the act and hurting her is not enough to make him stop. \nHe is a very low emotion person trying to achieve some sort of highs regardless of the impact it has on others. Absolutely despicable. These types of people are the scum of the earth.",

Cheating is considered as a terrible condemnable action by most people. It\u2019s a very basic, widespread justifiable notion of morality. I feel sorry you have trouble grasping those.\n\nRegarding intolerance, I have no reason to be jealous. I quite enjoy my life. I care about others. I probably care more about your wife\u2019s feelings than you, which is quite a disheartening thing to say but that\u2019s what it seems. I see people who suffer at the  hands of scum bags as my brothers and sisters to protect or defend. What can I say, I have quite a visceral reaction to creatures that put humanity to shame especially when they are prideful about being deranged and even seek sympathy and validation from bystanders.",

He just doesn\u2019t care enough to feel guilt (he has said this himself). \n\nI am no psychologist but I think this guy exudes a ton of sociopathic traits: low level emotion, role playing the hero fantasy while having no morals for societal approval, grandiose complex, lack of empathy, seeing people as transactional. Not all anti social disorder people are traitors because they see the value in people and don\u2019t want to leave them if they reap benefit. But his wife doesn\u2019t have that barrier to make him behave. It\u2019s clear that his wife is either trapped or stopped from leaving from other reasons that stop her from following her heart; he loses incentive to be faithful because he can keep disrespecting her and she can\u2019t leave and he has such lack of empathy that the immorality of the act and hurting her is not enough to make him stop. \nHe is a very low emotion person trying to achieve some sort of highs regardless of the impact it has on others. Absolutely despicable. These types of people are the scum of the earth.",

Bad behaviour punished. What a radical idea, right? \nRegarding religions, I\u2019m pretty sure I have clarified before that I am merely talking about ideas, not the believers. For me it\u2019s quite easy to separate both. \n\nRegarding humility, you honestly can\u2019t be serious. You won\u2019t ever find a huge post from me that spends a solid 50% talking about how successful and accomplished I am for someone to accept my money and give me themselves to cheat on my spouse.

Cheating is considered as a terrible condemnable action by most people. It\u2019s a very basic, widespread justifiable notion of morality. I feel sorry you have trouble grasping those.\n\nRegarding intolerance, I have no reason to be jealous. I quite enjoy my life. I care about others. I probably care more about your wife\u2019s feelings than you, which is quite a disheartening thing to say but that\u2019s what it seems. I see people who suffer at the  hands of scum bags as my brothers and sisters to protect or defend. What can I say, I have quite a visceral reaction to creatures that put humanity to shame especially when they are prideful about being deranged and even seek sympathy and validation from bystanders.",

He just doesn\u2019t care enough to feel guilt (he has said this himself). \n\nI am no psychologist but I think this guy exudes a ton of sociopathic traits: low level emotion, role playing the hero fantasy while having no morals for societal approval, grandiose complex, lack of empathy, seeing people as transactional. Not all anti social disorder people are traitors because they see the value in people and don\u2019t want to leave them if they reap benefit. But his wife doesn\u2019t have that barrier to make him behave. It\u2019s clear that his wife is either trapped or stopped from leaving from other reasons that stop her from following her heart; he loses incentive to be faithful because he can keep disrespecting her and she can\u2019t leave and he has such lack of empathy that the immorality of the act and hurting her is not enough to make him stop. \nHe is a very low emotion person trying to achieve some sort of highs regardless of the impact it has on others. Absolutely despicable. These types of people are the scum of the earth.",

Bad behaviour punished. What a radical idea, right? \nRegarding religions, I\u2019m pretty sure I have clarified before that I am merely talking about ideas, not the believers. For me it\u2019s quite easy to separate both. \n\nRegarding humility, you honestly can\u2019t be serious. You won\u2019t ever find a huge post from me that spends a solid 50% talking about how successful and accomplished I am for someone to accept my money and give me themselves to cheat on my spouse.

Cheating is considered as a terrible condemnable action by most people. It\u2019s a very basic, widespread justifiable notion of morality. I feel sorry you have trouble grasping those.\n\nRegarding intolerance, I have no reason to be jealous. I quite enjoy my life. I care about others. I probably care more about your wife\u2019s feelings than you, which is quite a disheartening thing to say but that\u2019s what it seems. I see people who suffer at the  hands of scum bags as my brothers and sisters to protect or defend. What can I say, I have quite a visceral reaction to creatures that put humanity to shame especially when they are prideful about being deranged and even seek sympathy and validation from bystanders.",

Regarding your last point. Of course we view the world through our own eyes but he is not an idiot, he knows exactly what he is doing and how it affects others. He just doesn\u2019t care enough to feel guilt (he has said this himself). \n\nI am no psychologist but I think this guy exudes a ton of sociopathic traits: low level emotion, role playing the hero fantasy while having no morals for societal approval, grandiose complex, lack of empathy, seeing people as transactional. Not all anti social disorder people are traitors because they see the value in people and don\u2019t want to leave them if they reap benefit. But his wife doesn\u2019t have that barrier to make him behave. It\u2019s clear that his wife is either trapped or stopped from leaving from other reasons that stop her from following her heart; he loses incentive to be faithful because he can keep disrespecting her and she can\u2019t leave and he has such lack of empathy that the immorality of the act and hurting her is not enough to make him stop. \nHe is a very low emotion person trying to achieve some sort of highs regardless of the impact it has on others. Absolutely despicable. These types of people are the scum of the earth.",

He just doesn\u2019t care enough to feel guilt (he has said this himself). \n\nI am no psychologist but I think this guy exudes a ton of sociopathic traits: low level emotion, role playing the hero fantasy while having no morals for societal approval, grandiose complex, lack of empathy, seeing people as transactional. Not all anti social disorder people are traitors because they see the value in people and don\u2019t want to leave them if they reap benefit. But his wife doesn\u2019t have that barrier to make him behave. It\u2019s clear that his wife is either trapped or stopped from leaving from other reasons that stop her from following her heart; he loses incentive to be faithful because he can keep disrespecting her and she can\u2019t leave and he has such lack of empathy that the immorality of the act and hurting her is not enough to make him stop. \nHe is a very low emotion person trying to achieve some sort of highs regardless of the impact it has on others. Absolutely despicable. These types of people are the scum of the earth.",

I probably care more about your wife\u2019s feelings than you, which is quite a disheartening thing to say but that\u2019s what it seems. I see people who suffer at the  hands of scum bags as my brothers and sisters to protect or defend. What can I say, I have quite a visceral reaction to creatures that put humanity to shame especially when they are prideful about being deranged and even seek sympathy and validation from bystanders.",

Of course we view the world through our own eyes but he is not an idiot, he knows exactly what he is doing and how it affects others. He just doesn\u2019t care enough to feel guilt (he has said this himself). \n\nI am no psychologist but I think this guy exudes a ton of sociopathic traits: low level emotion, role playing the hero fantasy while having no morals for societal approval, grandiose complex, lack of empathy, seeing people as transactional. Not all anti social disorder people are traitors because they see the value in people and don\u2019t want to leave them if they reap benefit. But his wife doesn\u2019t have that barrier to make him behave. It\u2019s clear that his wife is either trapped or stopped from leaving from other reasons that stop her from following her heart; he loses incentive to be faithful because he can keep disrespecting her and she can\u2019t leave and he has such lack of empathy that the immorality of the act and hurting her is not enough to make him stop. \nHe is a very low emotion person trying to achieve some sort of highs regardless of the impact it has on others. Absolutely despicable. These types of people are the scum of the earth.",

Of course we view the world through our own eyes but he is not an idiot, he knows exactly what he is doing and how it affects others. He just doesn\u2019t care enough to feel guilt (he has said this himself). \n\nI am no psychologist but I think this guy exudes a ton of sociopathic traits: low level emotion, role playing the hero fantasy while having no morals for societal approval, grandiose complex, lack of empathy, seeing people as transactional. Not all anti social disorder people are traitors because they see the value in people and don\u2019t want to leave them if they reap benefit. But his wife doesn\u2019t have that barrier to make him behave. It\u2019s clear that his wife is either trapped or stopped from leaving from other reasons that stop her from following her heart; he loses incentive to be faithful because he can keep disrespecting her and she can\u2019t leave and he has such lack of empathy that the immorality of the act and hurting her is not enough to make him stop. \nHe is a very low emotion person trying to achieve some sort of highs regardless of the impact it has on others. Absolutely despicable. These types of people are the scum of the earth.",

Cheating is considered as a terrible condemnable action by most people. It\u2019s a very basic, widespread justifiable notion of morality. I feel sorry you have trouble grasping those.\n\nRegarding intolerance, I have no reason to be jealous. I quite enjoy my life. I care about others. I probably care more about your wife\u2019s feelings than you, which is quite a disheartening thing to say but that\u2019s what it seems. I see people who suffer at the  hands of scum bags as my brothers and sisters to protect or defend. What can I say, I have quite a visceral reaction to creatures that put humanity to shame especially when they are prideful about being deranged and even seek sympathy and validation from bystanders.",

Of course we view the world through our own eyes but he is not an idiot, he knows exactly what he is doing and how it affects others. He just doesn\u2019t care enough to feel guilt (he has said this himself). \n\nI am no psychologist but I think this guy exudes a ton of sociopathic traits: low level emotion, role playing the hero fantasy while having no morals for societal approval, grandiose complex, lack of empathy, seeing people as transactional. Not all anti social disorder people are traitors because they see the value in people and don\u2019t want to leave them if they reap benefit. But his wife doesn\u2019t have that barrier to make him behave. It\u2019s clear that his wife is either trapped or stopped from leaving from other reasons that stop her from following her heart; he loses incentive to be faithful because he can keep disrespecting her and she can\u2019t leave and he has such lack of empathy that the immorality of the act and hurting her is not enough to make him stop. \nHe is a very low emotion person trying to achieve some sort of highs regardless of the impact it has on others. Absolutely despicable. These types of people are the scum of the earth.",

Cheating is considered as a terrible condemnable action by most people. It\u2019s a very basic, widespread justifiable notion of morality. I feel sorry you have trouble grasping those.\n\nRegarding intolerance, I have no reason to be jealous. I quite enjoy my life. I care about others. I probably care more about your wife\u2019s feelings than you, which is quite a disheartening thing to say but that\u2019s what it seems. I see people who suffer at the  hands of scum bags as my brothers and sisters to protect or defend. What can I say, I have quite a visceral reaction to creatures that put humanity to shame especially when they are prideful about being deranged and even seek sympathy and validation from bystanders.",

Of course we view the world through our own eyes but he is not an idiot, he knows exactly what he is doing and how it affects others. He just doesn\u2019t care enough to feel guilt (he has said this himself). \n\nI am no psychologist but I think this guy exudes a ton of sociopathic traits: low level emotion, role playing the hero fantasy while having no morals for societal approval, grandiose complex, lack of empathy, seeing people as transactional. Not all anti social disorder people are traitors because they see the value in people and don\u2019t want to leave them if they reap benefit. But his wife doesn\u2019t have that barrier to make him behave. It\u2019s clear that his wife is either trapped or stopped from leaving from other reasons that stop her from following her heart; he loses incentive to be faithful because he can keep disrespecting her and she can\u2019t leave and he has such lack of empathy that the immorality of the act and hurting her is not enough to make him stop. \nHe is a very low emotion person trying to achieve some sort of highs regardless of the impact it has on others. Absolutely despicable. These types of people are the scum of the earth.",

Cheating is considered as a terrible condemnable action by most people. It\u2019s a very basic, widespread justifiable notion of morality. I feel sorry you have trouble grasping those.\n\nRegarding intolerance, I have no reason to be jealous. I quite enjoy my life. I care about others. I probably care more about your wife\u2019s feelings than you, which is quite a disheartening thing to say but that\u2019s what it seems. I see people who suffer at the  hands of scum bags as my brothers and sisters to protect or defend. What can I say, I have quite a visceral reaction to creatures that put humanity to shame especially when they are prideful about being deranged and even seek sympathy and validation from bystanders.",

Of course we view the world through our own eyes but he is not an idiot, he knows exactly what he is doing and how it affects others. He just doesn\u2019t care enough to feel guilt (he has said this himself). \n\nI am no psychologist but I think this guy exudes a ton of sociopathic traits: low level emotion, role playing the hero fantasy while having no morals for societal approval, grandiose complex, lack of empathy, seeing people as transactional. Not all anti social disorder people are traitors because they see the value in people and don\u2019t want to leave them if they reap benefit. But his wife doesn\u2019t have that barrier to make him behave. It\u2019s clear that his wife is either trapped or stopped from leaving from other reasons that stop her from following her heart; he loses incentive to be faithful because he can keep disrespecting her and she can\u2019t leave and he has such lack of empathy that the immorality of the act and hurting her is not enough to make him stop. \nHe is a very low emotion person trying to achieve some sort of highs regardless of the impact it has on others. Absolutely despicable. These types of people are the scum of the earth.",

Of course we view the world through our own eyes but he is not an idiot, he knows exactly what he is doing and how it affects others. He just doesn\u2019t care enough to feel guilt (he has said this himself). \n\nI am no psychologist but I think this guy exudes a ton of sociopathic traits: low level emotion, role playing the hero fantasy while having no morals for societal approval, grandiose complex, lack of empathy, seeing people as transactional. Not all anti social disorder people are traitors because they see the value in people and don\u2019t want to leave them if they reap benefit. But his wife doesn\u2019t have that barrier to make him behave. It\u2019s clear that his wife is either trapped or stopped from leaving from other reasons that stop her from following her heart; he loses incentive to be faithful because he can keep disrespecting her and she can\u2019t leave and he has such lack of empathy that the immorality of the act and hurting her is not enough to make him stop. \nHe is a very low emotion person trying to achieve some sort of highs regardless of the impact it has on others. Absolutely despicable. These types of people are the scum of the earth.",

Of course we view the world through our own eyes but he is not an idiot, he knows exactly what he is doing and how it affects others. He just doesn\u2019t care enough to feel guilt (he has said this himself). \n\nI am no psychologist but I think this guy exudes a ton of sociopathic traits: low level emotion, role playing the hero fantasy while having no morals for societal approval, grandiose complex, lack of empathy, seeing people as transactional. Not all anti social disorder people are traitors because they see the value in people and don\u2019t want to leave them if they reap benefit. But his wife doesn\u2019t have that barrier to make him behave. It\u2019s clear that his wife is either trapped or stopped from leaving from other reasons that stop her from following her heart; he loses incentive to be faithful because he can keep disrespecting her and she can\u2019t leave and he has such lack of empathy that the immorality of the act and hurting her is not enough to make him stop. \nHe is a very low emotion person trying to achieve some sort of highs regardless of the impact it has on others. Absolutely despicable. These types of people are the scum of the earth.",

Of course we view the world through our own eyes but he is not an idiot, he knows exactly what he is doing and how it affects others. He just doesn\u2019t care enough to feel guilt (he has said this himself). \n\nI am no psychologist but I think this guy exudes a ton of sociopathic traits: low level emotion, role playing the hero fantasy while having no morals for societal approval, grandiose complex, lack of empathy, seeing people as transactional. Not all anti social disorder people are traitors because they see the value in people and don\u2019t want to leave them if they reap benefit. But his wife doesn\u2019t have that barrier to make him behave. It\u2019s clear that his wife is either trapped or stopped from leaving from other reasons that stop her from following her heart; he loses incentive to be faithful because he can keep disrespecting her and she can\u2019t leave and he has such lack of empathy that the immorality of the act and hurting her is not enough to make him stop. \nHe is a very low emotion person trying to achieve some sort of highs regardless of the impact it has on others. Absolutely despicable. These types of people are the scum of the earth.",

Of course we view the world through our own eyes but he is not an idiot, he knows exactly what he is doing and how it affects others. He just doesn\u2019t care enough to feel guilt (he has said this himself). \n\nI am no psychologist but I think this guy exudes a ton of sociopathic traits: low level emotion, role playing the hero fantasy while having no morals for societal approval, grandiose complex, lack of empathy, seeing people as transactional. Not all anti social disorder people are traitors because they see the value in people and don\u2019t want to leave them if they reap benefit. But his wife doesn\u2019t have that barrier to make him behave. It\u2019s clear that his wife is either trapped or stopped from leaving from other reasons that stop her from following her heart; he loses incentive to be faithful because he can keep disrespecting her and she can\u2019t leave and he has such lack of empathy that the immorality of the act and hurting her is not enough to make him stop. \nHe is a very low emotion person trying to achieve some sort of highs regardless of the impact it has on others. Absolutely despicable. These types of people are the scum of the earth.",

Of course we view the world through our own eyes but he is not an idiot, he knows exactly what he is doing and how it affects others. He just doesn\u2019t care enough to feel guilt (he has said this himself). \n\nI am no psychologist but I think this guy exudes a ton of sociopathic traits: low level emotion, role playing the hero fantasy while having no morals for societal approval, grandiose complex, lack of empathy, seeing people as transactional. Not all anti social disorder people are traitors because they see the value in people and don\u2019t want to leave them if they reap benefit. But his wife doesn\u2019t have that barrier to make him behave. It\u2019s clear that his wife is either trapped or stopped from leaving from other reasons that stop her from following her heart; he loses incentive to be faithful because he can keep disrespecting her and she can\u2019t leave and he has such lack of empathy that the immorality of the act and hurting her is not enough to make him stop. \nHe is a very low emotion person trying to achieve some sort of highs regardless of the impact it has on others. Absolutely despicable. These types of people are the scum of the earth.",

Cheating is considered as a terrible condemnable action by most people. It\u2019s a very basic, widespread justifiable notion of morality. I feel sorry you have trouble grasping those.\n\nRegarding intolerance, I have no reason to be jealous. I quite enjoy my life. I care about others. I probably care more about your wife\u2019s feelings than you, which is quite a disheartening thing to say but that\u2019s what it seems. I see people who suffer at the  hands of scum bags as my brothers and sisters to protect or defend. What can I say, I have quite a visceral reaction to creatures that put humanity to shame especially when they are prideful about being deranged and even seek sympathy and validation from bystanders.",

Cheating is considered as a terrible condemnable action by most people. It\u2019s a very basic, widespread justifiable notion of morality. I feel sorry you have trouble grasping those.\n\nRegarding intolerance, I have no reason to be jealous. I quite enjoy my life. I care about others. I probably care more about your wife\u2019s feelings than you, which is quite a disheartening thing to say but that\u2019s what it seems. I see people who suffer at the  hands of scum bags as my brothers and sisters to protect or defend. What can I say, I have quite a visceral reaction to creatures that put humanity to shame especially when they are prideful about being deranged and even seek sympathy and validation from bystanders.",

It\u2019s a very basic, widespread justifiable notion of morality. I feel sorry you have trouble grasping those.\n\nRegarding intolerance, I have no reason to be jealous. I quite enjoy my life. I care about others. I probably care more about your wife\u2019s feelings than you, which is quite a disheartening thing to say but that\u2019s what it seems. I see people who suffer at the  hands of scum bags as my brothers and sisters to protect or defend. What can I say, I have quite a visceral reaction to creatures that put humanity to shame especially when they are prideful about being deranged and even seek sympathy and validation from bystanders.",

I care about others. I probably care more about your wife\u2019s feelings than you, which is quite a disheartening thing to say but that\u2019s what it seems. I see people who suffer at the  hands of scum bags as my brothers and sisters to protect or defend.
