For some reason everyone on the \"malehairadvice\" sub is telling literally *everyone* to buzz their head and grow a beard these days, no matter what they look like. With all due respect, you're handsome as hell but that beard is pretty patchy, you could def get away with the stubble->shave->stubble->shave cycle to mix it up though. You have the rest of your life to go bald and grow a beard, you only look like a handsome young man for a while.",
