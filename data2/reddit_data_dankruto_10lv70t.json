Her navigating towards sasuke was so sad because he was probably the first person to ever save her from anything. and then ofc it turned out that he just saw her as a tool like how her old tormentors in kusa did. But ofc she, like all of orochimaru's people, was willing to forgive everything because sasuke had rescued her after all. \n\nIt was such a good way to show that sasuke had become just like Orochimaru, despite all of his talk about never becoming like orochimaru. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd then she finally gets rescued by Naruto and says that his chakra is so warm and stuff, like the sun, and I was so fucking happy like... finally!!!!!!!!!!! LETS GGOOOOO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT AND EMOTIONAL TALK-NO-JUTSU COMING UPPPPPP\n\nAnd then they ended her arc like..... that. cuz.. yeah ofc Naruto is just so focused on that sasuke D.......\n\nIF I had to choose between Naruto saving her or sasuke I'd have him save her 100% of the time....",

Also why would he run around looking for an extinct clan. Yes he would love a new found family but to Naruto his family was the leaf now and he wanted to be Hokage. He\u2019s not gonna pull a Sasuke and travel the world for years looking for redhead Children then trying to figure out if they\u2019re related or not. Kushina told him the clan was extinct, why would he not believe his mom?\n\nIt\u2019s also unknown if Karin even knew she was an Uzumaki.",

Orochimaru states \"The same power as Kushina Uzumaki, she's finally attained it.\" Implying that it's an ability that they've hoped for her to achieve throughout her training, in which she'd need to know that she's an Uzumaki.\n\nBeing his main warden for one of the hideouts as well as the nature of her abilities + her Intel about the Ninja world it wouldn't make sense for her to not know she's an Uzumaki.\n\n>Where are the Uzumaki? Oh, they were destroyed for no reason (The Iwa+Kumo Collaborative forces is a stupid fan theory).\n\nThey were destroyed for their proficiency in sealing Jutsu + chakra potency, which we know the leaf heavily relied on for their Bijuu sealings... Each of the Kurama Jinchuriki have been Uzumaki, take out the Uzumaki clan and the leaf potentially lose their nuclear deterrent...\n\nWe were never told the exact motive but it doesn't seem extremely hard to deduce why they'd be an important target. \n\n>Why Nagato never reacted to Naruto being an Uzumaki? \"We are both from the same clan, I leave everything to you, Naruto\".\n\nWhy would this be relevant? Their clan doesn't exist, nor have they ever spent a day surrounded by their clansmen... Why would this connection reign over them being sibling students? Especially considering the significance behind that connection being the fact that Nagato has killed Jiraiya, it doesn't even seem like it would make sense for them to have a conversation about the Uzumaki. They know nothing of the clan. \n\n>He should've at least said that. Who are the Uzumaki? Some relatives of the Senju clan.\n\nWhy? Why do you see this as something that would've contributed to the narrative. I'd like an extremely specific answer based on who we know Nagato & Naruto to be and the direction of the story! \n\n>Edit: Tsunade is supposed to be Uzumaki from her grandma's side. Isn't weird how she never mentioned it to Naruto? Why?\n\nNo, it isn't weird at all. Why would this be a relevant conversation for them to have? To the viewers knowledge, Tsunade didn't grow up in the land of Eddie's so why would she place importance in her being a percentage of Uzumaki...\n\nI'm lightskinned, but have about 20% Italian roots. I don't walk up to every Italian attempting to strike conversation about our lineage. \n\nWhat exactly is your gripe with the Uzumaki? You clearly don't have a problem with artists adding in new information into a story (considering it's within every story ever created), so is it that the viewers don't have enough information about the Uzumaki?\n\nIf that's the case, I hope you voted for the Uzumaki clan leader in the poll each week!",

I've asked what would be the narrative relevance, which is an extremely specific question. Please don't simplify my question in an attempt to strengthen your comment, it's fallacious and ratty! Just answer please.\n\nWhat significance would 3 distinct Shinobi meeting and discussing a clan that they've never known pose to the story or Naruto's arc in general? Would Naruto being in the same clan as Nagato mean more than them being sibling students to the only father figure Naruto has ever had in his life, if so, why?\n\nConsidering Nagato, Karin & Naruto were all orphaned what direction would you like that conversation to take? Would it be a simple reference to the fact that they're Uzumaki, what would come afterwards?\n\nHow would you write this interaction in a way that adds to the themes of the story?\n\n>Why should they do that? Because it\u2019s an opportunity for naruto to learn more about his clan?\n\nWhy does Naruto need to learn more about his clan, had this been a character trait of his, wouldn't he have asked around a bit more? Or at least shown a tad bit of curiosity regarding his roots? If he doesn't do it in the show, why would this be significant? \n\nIt seems as if it's an opportunity for YOU to learn about the Uzumaki, though that distinction hasn't been made in your mind yet. A concept that you'd like to see within a story doesn't somehow make the writing bad when that specific concept is not written in a way you'd have liked to see. Which is why I'm asking you a bunch of why questions, people who narratively analyze have very specific reasons for why changes are to be made or how the writing could've been enhanced... You have a bunch of creative opinions, which is fine, but that's all. \n\n>It\u2019s bad writing to have people be from the same clan, have the chance to meet up, and never refer to the fact that they\u2019re related or from the same clan, which is also the same clan that was eradicated. \n\nWhy, how did this affect the narrative in a negative way? If it didn't, how could it be bad writing? \n\n>The fact that it was eradicated except for a handful of people makes the fact that they didn\u2019t even have any reaction towards them being related, or the fact that they didn\u2019t say anything about them being also being uzumaki, bad writing. \n\nWhy? Both Karin & Nagato are orphaned before the eradication of the clan I believe... Naruto is born after the full eradication. What would bring any of these characters to care about the massacre?\n\nShould Sarada care about the Uchiha massacre? So far, she hasn't, is this also bad writing? If so, why? \n\n>And if you\u2019re going to respond in 15 different segments please just save us both the time and don\u2019t\n\nShould be a very quick read, hopefully you have you answers ready :)",

Change it to \u201cresponse\u201d instead of \u201cquestion\u201d then. Your responses are a lot of questions asking why should they do that. \n\n>Why does naruto need to learn more about his clan\n\nBecause it would\u2019ve been a good idea from a writing standpoint. The whole argument was that it\u2019s bad writing to introduce these people to all have the same heritage, and then not give a single care in the world about it. It\u2019s bad writing. Don\u2019t even introduce these characters to have the same heritage and have them meet each other if they don\u2019t care about it. \n\nAt that point all it ends up being is an excuse to how these people have so much chakra. It\u2019s a tool used for explaining how a character is strong or has more chakra than normal, with no other aspect about it being brought up.\n\nThese people are orphans, nagato, Karin, and naruto, yet they don\u2019t care they they\u2019re related? It\u2019s bad writing, that\u2019s what it comes down to. \n\nYou asking me to explain how it can be done better or how it should be written- doesn\u2019t hold up as strongly either. You don\u2019t need to be a chef in order to claim the foods bad. \n\nNext, your counter argument to that would be something similar to \u201cwell if you\u2019re critiquing food, you should have some knowledge of how to cook yourself\u201d\n\nSure, it would hold more weight to what I said. But I don\u2019t need to have such a strong argument. Simply bringing these characters together with a shared background and not capitalizing on it aside from \u201chey they all have a lot of chakra\u201d is wasted potential... If you disagree with that, then that just says more about your own imagination or lack of. \n\nYou can claim what I said is a fallacy, and an attack of character, because well it sort of is with that last sentence. My opinion is, there could\u2019ve been a lot more between them, so if you disagree with that, then that\u2019s pretty odd in its own way. Especially considering how much the war arc dragged along, but that\u2019s not the main point anyway.\n\n>Should sarada care about the Uchiha massacre?\n\nUm, yes? The massacre that her own uncle participated in, and the same massacre that left her father as an orphan? Yes, she should care about it. Do you disagree? \n\n>Is it bad writing?\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure there was some curiosity between her and the uchiha clan, maybe it was just about the eyes though. Is it bad writing? I don\u2019t watch boruto enough to make a judgement about it. \n\nIf a random Uchiha clan member suddenly appeared in the story in contact with her, and she doesn\u2019t care that he\u2019s an Uchiha, then yes, that would probably be bad writing.",

Naruto, being an orphan his whole life, you think would at least have some questions and want more insight into his family and his lineage. And hearing about Tsunade, that also seems like kind of a big deal. Like maybe even throughout their time together she could at least drop some hints to him about their shared genetics or something. Like literally, something! Anything! Naruto being all alone and ignored was literally his main motivation in life. To just not really address it when he finally has found his family is\u2026.appalling??  \n\nIt\u2019s wild to me to hear that this wasn\u2019t brought up at all.

He could've explained to him the meaning behind the spiral and a lot of other things. \n\n>What is an asspull about it? Why do they have to know about a mostly exterminated clan? There are seemingly many exterminated or nearly exterminated clans. \n\nBecause Nagato and Karin were never called Uzumaki before Kushina's appearance. There's no way Nagato didn't know he is an Uzumaki, so why he never spoke about it with Naruto? He kept mumbling \"Where is Uzumaki Naruto\" without thinking that Naruto is from the same clan as him. (Even after they became fond of each other, it was never mentioned once)\n\n>Why would Kabuto or Orochimaru tell her? They cared about her healing ability. \n\nWhy not? And doesn't she have a mother? Why her mother had never told her about the Uzumaki clan? \n\n>Something that wasn\u2019t necessarily planned from the beginning isn\u2019t an asspull.\n\nAn asspull is something devised to fill a gap. The Senju Relation, his resemblance to Hashirama, reincarnation, and his rivalry with Sasuke. Making Naruto a Senju would've been dumb, so Kishimoto came up with the Uzumaki.",

Even the members of the clan didn't know that they belonged to it. Shiki Fujin was supposed to be Minato's Justu, however, it suddenly turned out to be an Uzumaki's Jutsu. Can't you see how their abilities are exactly similar to the Senju? Strong Chakra, strong life force, and nice sealing abilities (Tobirama and Hashirama were seal masters).

Jeraiya clearly wasn\u2019t interested in telling Naruto about his parents. \n\nThe clan is nearly extinct and spread apart.

It\u2019s not like the uzamakis were retconned in. It was just unknown history to us that never had any reason to come up.  \n\nWe know very little except they had strong life force, focused in dealing, and were nearly extinct. This made them strong candidates for jinchuriki. The reaper death seal was a secret from everyone except minato and hiruzen who learned it from minato. All we as the reader could know about it is what hiruzen knew about it.\n\nI\u2019m very confused how you believe it\u2019s an asspull. The full uzamakis have red hair and exist before we know anything about asura and the senju. They are similar to the senju which we learn later.  None of that comes from no where though.

Instead of the usual sitting in seat waiting for someone to find kawaki.\n\nIt\u2019s a reactive character driven story and that\u2019s usually a bad recipe, because outside of some world ending threat all the tension is gone.\n\nHe\u2019s 33 right now. I\u2019m 32 and just getting started. Even reconnecting with my own ancestral roots.\n\nIt only loses meaning if you make it so,amici.\n\n\nThe whole \u201cmy character arc is done\u201d if you are the sitting general of a nation is kinda crazy.\nThere is ALWAYS something worth exploring and fixing in the military.\n\nNothing was worse than just giving us peace time and \u201ccalming the world down\u201d\n\nOn Taka, he\u2019s not really shown animosity towards Karin, she just kind of a bich. Hell he\u2019s not all that unfriendly towards Orochimaru, he\u2019s really moreso just putting up that front because he knows how dangerous he can be, and that he\u2019s essentially a ticking time bomb, who will destroy when bored.\n\nOro seems to have kind of matured in a way though.\nI wonder if it has to do with kabuto.\n\n\nAnyway. Yes. I think you could have the uzumaki just hiding somewhere. A rabbit goddess possesses the uchiha patriarch, and the series is about aliens and artificial humans right now.\n\nHaving 50 uzumaki survive, and multiplying isn\u2019t that hard at all.",

Relying on the root, to nourish the leaf.\nSasuke is doing Danzo work.\n\n\n\nNothing he has done has shown us how fulfilling positions of command can be. Show us how the village works, explore the world, and make it just as vibrant and funky as it used to be.\n\n\nSo it\u2019s just alien attacks for now.\nNow kishimoto may not have the chops or interest to write that way, but the problem is, he wrote a setting with like no tension.\n\n\nAnd we also have to remember, naruto speaks like a punk. It wasn\u2019t just the fox, he\u2019s also kind of\u2026 abrasive.\nHe\u2019s older, but the same dude.\n\n\nHe\u2019s had so little on screen time with them that it\u2019s weird for him to have a negative opinion, but Naruto forms opinions about people before he gets to know them as a defense mechanism.\n\nThey aren\u2019t team rocket, how much trouble could they have really caused him? He doesn\u2019t even say \u201cme\u201d he says, \u201csomebody\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll lean into the manga since kishi writes it personally, but it\u2019s been ootsusuki time for the past couple of years.\n\n\nSure it\u2019s \u201cboruto\u2019s story\u201d, but it skipped all the good parts to get to the ayylmaos.\n\nSo, pivoting a little and doing some other stuff for a while would be refreshing. \n\n\nPersonally I AM loving the Eida/Amado parts, because if anything, they are both well designed and active participants instead of mostly passive defenders.\n\nSeeing a kage level infiltration and rescue mission to liberate his kinsmen would be lit.\n\nOne thing you overlooked in saying konoha is his family is the world is his family. He\u2019s the head of the gokage. So it\u2019s not like he would neglect new people.\n\nKawaki got a position didn\u2019t he?",

Her navigating towards sasuke was so sad because he was probably the first person to ever save her from anything. and then ofc it turned out that he just saw her as a tool like how her old tormentors in kusa did. But ofc she, like all of orochimaru's people, was willing to forgive everything because sasuke had rescued her after all. \n\nIt was such a good way to show that sasuke had become just like Orochimaru, despite all of his talk about never becoming like orochimaru. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd then she finally gets rescued by Naruto and says that his chakra is so warm and stuff, like the sun, and I was so fucking happy like... finally!!!!!!!!!!! LETS GGOOOOO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT AND EMOTIONAL TALK-NO-JUTSU COMING UPPPPPP\n\nAnd then they ended her arc like..... that. cuz.. yeah ofc Naruto is just so focused on that sasuke D.......\n\nIF I had to choose between Naruto saving her or sasuke I'd have him save her 100% of the time....",

Also why would he run around looking for an extinct clan. Yes he would love a new found family but to Naruto his family was the leaf now and he wanted to be Hokage. He\u2019s not gonna pull a Sasuke and travel the world for years looking for redhead Children then trying to figure out if they\u2019re related or not.

Orochimaru states \"The same power as Kushina Uzumaki, she's finally attained it.\" Implying that it's an ability that they've hoped for her to achieve throughout her training, in which she'd need to know that she's an Uzumaki.\n\nBeing his main warden for one of the hideouts as well as the nature of her abilities + her Intel about the Ninja world it wouldn't make sense for her to not know she's an Uzumaki.\n\n>Where are the Uzumaki? Oh, they were destroyed for no reason (The Iwa+Kumo Collaborative forces is a stupid fan theory).\n\nThey were destroyed for their proficiency in sealing Jutsu + chakra potency, which we know the leaf heavily relied on for their Bijuu sealings... Each of the Kurama Jinchuriki have been Uzumaki, take out the Uzumaki clan and the leaf potentially lose their nuclear deterrent...\n\nWe were never told the exact motive but it doesn't seem extremely hard to deduce why they'd be an important target. \n\n>Why Nagato never reacted to Naruto being an Uzumaki? \"We are both from the same clan, I leave everything to you, Naruto\".\n\nWhy would this be relevant? Their clan doesn't exist, nor have they ever spent a day surrounded by their clansmen... Why would this connection reign over them being sibling students? Especially considering the significance behind that connection being the fact that Nagato has killed Jiraiya, it doesn't even seem like it would make sense for them to have a conversation about the Uzumaki. They know nothing of the clan. \n\n>He should've at least said that. Who are the Uzumaki? Some relatives of the Senju clan.\n\nWhy? Why do you see this as something that would've contributed to the narrative. I'd like an extremely specific answer based on who we know Nagato & Naruto to be and the direction of the story! \n\n>Edit: Tsunade is supposed to be Uzumaki from her grandma's side. Isn't weird how she never mentioned it to Naruto? Why?\n\nNo, it isn't weird at all. Why would this be a relevant conversation for them to have? To the viewers knowledge, Tsunade didn't grow up in the land of Eddie's so why would she place importance in her being a percentage of Uzumaki...\n\nI'm lightskinned, but have about 20% Italian roots. I don't walk up to every Italian attempting to strike conversation about our lineage. \n\nWhat exactly is your gripe with the Uzumaki? You clearly don't have a problem with artists adding in new information into a story (considering it's within every story ever created), so is it that the viewers don't have enough information about the Uzumaki?\n\nIf that's the case, I hope you voted for the Uzumaki clan leader in the poll each week!",

I've asked what would be the narrative relevance, which is an extremely specific question. Please don't simplify my question in an attempt to strengthen your comment, it's fallacious and ratty! Just answer please.\n\nWhat significance would 3 distinct Shinobi meeting and discussing a clan that they've never known pose to the story or Naruto's arc in general? Would Naruto being in the same clan as Nagato mean more than them being sibling students to the only father figure Naruto has ever had in his life, if so, why?\n\nConsidering Nagato, Karin & Naruto were all orphaned what direction would you like that conversation to take? Would it be a simple reference to the fact that they're Uzumaki, what would come afterwards?\n\nHow would you write this interaction in a way that adds to the themes of the story?\n\n>Why should they do that? Because it\u2019s an opportunity for naruto to learn more about his clan?\n\nWhy does Naruto need to learn more about his clan, had this been a character trait of his, wouldn't he have asked around a bit more? Or at least shown a tad bit of curiosity regarding his roots? If he doesn't do it in the show, why would this be significant? \n\nIt seems as if it's an opportunity for YOU to learn about the Uzumaki, though that distinction hasn't been made in your mind yet. A concept that you'd like to see within a story doesn't somehow make the writing bad when that specific concept is not written in a way you'd have liked to see. Which is why I'm asking you a bunch of why questions, people who narratively analyze have very specific reasons for why changes are to be made or how the writing could've been enhanced... You have a bunch of creative opinions, which is fine, but that's all. \n\n>It\u2019s bad writing to have people be from the same clan, have the chance to meet up, and never refer to the fact that they\u2019re related or from the same clan, which is also the same clan that was eradicated. \n\nWhy, how did this affect the narrative in a negative way? If it didn't, how could it be bad writing? \n\n>The fact that it was eradicated except for a handful of people makes the fact that they didn\u2019t even have any reaction towards them being related, or the fact that they didn\u2019t say anything about them being also being uzumaki, bad writing. \n\nWhy? Both Karin & Nagato are orphaned before the eradication of the clan I believe... Naruto is born after the full eradication. What would bring any of these characters to care about the massacre?\n\nShould Sarada care about the Uchiha massacre? So far, she hasn't, is this also bad writing? If so, why? \n\n>And if you\u2019re going to respond in 15 different segments please just save us both the time and don\u2019t\n\nShould be a very quick read, hopefully you have you answers ready :)",

Change it to \u201cresponse\u201d instead of \u201cquestion\u201d then. Your responses are a lot of questions asking why should they do that. \n\n>Why does naruto need to learn more about his clan\n\nBecause it would\u2019ve been a good idea from a writing standpoint. The whole argument was that it\u2019s bad writing to introduce these people to all have the same heritage, and then not give a single care in the world about it. It\u2019s bad writing. Don\u2019t even introduce these characters to have the same heritage and have them meet each other if they don\u2019t care about it. \n\nAt that point all it ends up being is an excuse to how these people have so much chakra. It\u2019s a tool used for explaining how a character is strong or has more chakra than normal, with no other aspect about it being brought up.\n\nThese people are orphans, nagato, Karin, and naruto, yet they don\u2019t care they they\u2019re related? It\u2019s bad writing, that\u2019s what it comes down to. \n\nYou asking me to explain how it can be done better or how it should be written- doesn\u2019t hold up as strongly either. You don\u2019t need to be a chef in order to claim the foods bad. \n\nNext, your counter argument to that would be something similar to \u201cwell if you\u2019re critiquing food, you should have some knowledge of how to cook yourself\u201d\n\nSure, it would hold more weight to what I said. But I don\u2019t need to have such a strong argument. Simply bringing these characters together with a shared background and not capitalizing on it aside from \u201chey they all have a lot of chakra\u201d is wasted potential... If you disagree with that, then that just says more about your own imagination or lack of. \n\nYou can claim what I said is a fallacy, and an attack of character, because well it sort of is with that last sentence. My opinion is, there could\u2019ve been a lot more between them, so if you disagree with that, then that\u2019s pretty odd in its own way. Especially considering how much the war arc dragged along, but that\u2019s not the main point anyway.\n\n>Should sarada care about the Uchiha massacre?\n\nUm, yes? The massacre that her own uncle participated in, and the same massacre that left her father as an orphan? Yes, she should care about it. Do you disagree? \n\n>Is it bad writing?\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure there was some curiosity between her and the uchiha clan, maybe it was just about the eyes though. Is it bad writing? I don\u2019t watch boruto enough to make a judgement about it. \n\nIf a random Uchiha clan member suddenly appeared in the story in contact with her, and she doesn\u2019t care that he\u2019s an Uchiha, then yes, that would probably be bad writing.",

Naruto, being an orphan his whole life, you think would at least have some questions and want more insight into his family and his lineage. And hearing about Tsunade, that also seems like kind of a big deal. Like maybe even throughout their time together she could at least drop some hints to him about their shared genetics or something.

To just not really address it when he finally has found his family is\u2026.appalling??  \n\nIt\u2019s wild to me to hear that this wasn\u2019t brought up at all.

A super clan that can do anything in fanfics\". Neither Jiraiya, Tsunade, Hiruzen, Shikamaru, Sakura. All megaminds never mentioned it once. I can understand Minato but why not Uzumaki?",

There are seemingly many exterminated or nearly exterminated clans. \n\nBecause Nagato and Karin were never called Uzumaki before Kushina's appearance. There's no way Nagato didn't know he is an Uzumaki, so why he never spoke about it with Naruto? He kept mumbling \"Where is Uzumaki Naruto\" without thinking that Naruto is from the same clan as him.

Yes. I think you could have the uzumaki just hiding somewhere.

He\u2019s not Sasuke, he has a village to look after and can\u2019t afford to go traveling for at least months to find an extinct clan? \n\nNah Naruto literally calls the [whole team out lol](https://cm.blazefast.co/53/6b/536b19e580003cc248f7bfece3c98452.jpg)",

Relying on the root, to nourish the leaf.\nSasuke is doing Danzo work.\n\n\n\nNothing he has done has shown us how fulfilling positions of command can be. Show us how the village works, explore the world, and make it just as vibrant and funky as it used to be.\n\n\nSo it\u2019s just alien attacks for now.\nNow kishimoto may not have the chops or interest to write that way, but the problem is, he wrote a setting with like no tension.\n\n\nAnd we also have to remember, naruto speaks like a punk. It wasn\u2019t just the fox, he\u2019s also kind of\u2026 abrasive.\nHe\u2019s older, but the same dude.\n\n\nHe\u2019s had so little on screen time with them that it\u2019s weird for him to have a negative opinion, but Naruto forms opinions about people before he gets to know them as a defense mechanism.\n\nThey aren\u2019t team rocket, how much trouble could they have really caused him? He doesn\u2019t even say \u201cme\u201d he says, \u201csomebody\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll lean into the manga since kishi writes it personally, but it\u2019s been ootsusuki time for the past couple of years.\n\n\nSure it\u2019s \u201cboruto\u2019s story\u201d, but it skipped all the good parts to get to the ayylmaos.\n\nSo, pivoting a little and doing some other stuff for a while would be refreshing. \n\n\nPersonally I AM loving the Eida/Amado parts, because if anything, they are both well designed and active participants instead of mostly passive defenders.\n\nSeeing a kage level infiltration and rescue mission to liberate his kinsmen would be lit.\n\nOne thing you overlooked in saying konoha is his family is the world is his family. He\u2019s the head of the gokage. So it\u2019s not like he would neglect new people.\n\nKawaki got a position didn\u2019t he?",

Her navigating towards sasuke was so sad because he was probably the first person to ever save her from anything. and then ofc it turned out that he just saw her as a tool like how her old tormentors in kusa did. But ofc she, like all of orochimaru's people, was willing to forgive everything because sasuke had rescued her after all. \n\nIt was such a good way to show that sasuke had become just like Orochimaru, despite all of his talk about never becoming like orochimaru. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd then she finally gets rescued by Naruto and says that his chakra is so warm and stuff, like the sun, and I was so fucking happy like... finally!!!!!!!!!!! LETS GGOOOOO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT AND EMOTIONAL TALK-NO-JUTSU COMING UPPPPPP\n\nAnd then they ended her arc like..... that. cuz.. yeah ofc Naruto is just so focused on that sasuke D.......\n\nIF I had to choose between Naruto saving her or sasuke I'd have him save her 100% of the time....",

He\u2019s not gonna pull a Sasuke and travel the world for years looking for redhead Children then trying to figure out if they\u2019re related or not. Kushina told him the clan was extinct, why would he not believe his mom?\n\nIt\u2019s also unknown if Karin even knew she was an Uzumaki.",

Oh, they were destroyed for no reason (The Iwa+Kumo Collaborative forces is a stupid fan theory).\n\nThey were destroyed for their proficiency in sealing Jutsu + chakra potency, which we know the leaf heavily relied on for their Bijuu sealings...

I don't walk up to every Italian attempting to strike conversation about our lineage. \n\nWhat exactly is your gripe with the Uzumaki? You clearly don't have a problem with artists adding in new information into a story (considering it's within every story ever created), so is it that the viewers don't have enough information about the Uzumaki?\n\nIf that's the case, I hope you voted for the Uzumaki clan leader in the poll each week!",

I've asked what would be the narrative relevance, which is an extremely specific question. Please don't simplify my question in an attempt to strengthen your comment, it's fallacious and ratty! Just answer please.\n\nWhat significance would 3 distinct Shinobi meeting and discussing a clan that they've never known pose to the story or Naruto's arc in general? Would Naruto being in the same clan as Nagato mean more than them being sibling students to the only father figure Naruto has ever had in his life, if so, why?\n\nConsidering Nagato, Karin & Naruto were all orphaned what direction would you like that conversation to take? Would it be a simple reference to the fact that they're Uzumaki, what would come afterwards?\n\nHow would you write this interaction in a way that adds to the themes of the story?\n\n>Why should they do that? Because it\u2019s an opportunity for naruto to learn more about his clan?\n\nWhy does Naruto need to learn more about his clan, had this been a character trait of his, wouldn't he have asked around a bit more? Or at least shown a tad bit of curiosity regarding his roots? If he doesn't do it in the show, why would this be significant? \n\nIt seems as if it's an opportunity for YOU to learn about the Uzumaki, though that distinction hasn't been made in your mind yet. A concept that you'd like to see within a story doesn't somehow make the writing bad when that specific concept is not written in a way you'd have liked to see. Which is why I'm asking you a bunch of why questions, people who narratively analyze have very specific reasons for why changes are to be made or how the writing could've been enhanced... You have a bunch of creative opinions, which is fine, but that's all. \n\n>It\u2019s bad writing to have people be from the same clan, have the chance to meet up, and never refer to the fact that they\u2019re related or from the same clan, which is also the same clan that was eradicated. \n\nWhy, how did this affect the narrative in a negative way? If it didn't, how could it be bad writing? \n\n>The fact that it was eradicated except for a handful of people makes the fact that they didn\u2019t even have any reaction towards them being related, or the fact that they didn\u2019t say anything about them being also being uzumaki, bad writing. \n\nWhy? Both Karin & Nagato are orphaned before the eradication of the clan I believe... Naruto is born after the full eradication. What would bring any of these characters to care about the massacre?\n\nShould Sarada care about the Uchiha massacre? So far, she hasn't, is this also bad writing? If so, why? \n\n>And if you\u2019re going to respond in 15 different segments please just save us both the time and don\u2019t\n\nShould be a very quick read, hopefully you have you answers ready :)",

Change it to \u201cresponse\u201d instead of \u201cquestion\u201d then. Your responses are a lot of questions asking why should they do that. \n\n>Why does naruto need to learn more about his clan\n\nBecause it would\u2019ve been a good idea from a writing standpoint. The whole argument was that it\u2019s bad writing to introduce these people to all have the same heritage, and then not give a single care in the world about it. It\u2019s bad writing. Don\u2019t even introduce these characters to have the same heritage and have them meet each other if they don\u2019t care about it. \n\nAt that point all it ends up being is an excuse to how these people have so much chakra. It\u2019s a tool used for explaining how a character is strong or has more chakra than normal, with no other aspect about it being brought up.\n\nThese people are orphans, nagato, Karin, and naruto, yet they don\u2019t care they they\u2019re related? It\u2019s bad writing, that\u2019s what it comes down to. \n\nYou asking me to explain how it can be done better or how it should be written- doesn\u2019t hold up as strongly either. You don\u2019t need to be a chef in order to claim the foods bad. \n\nNext, your counter argument to that would be something similar to \u201cwell if you\u2019re critiquing food, you should have some knowledge of how to cook yourself\u201d\n\nSure, it would hold more weight to what I said. But I don\u2019t need to have such a strong argument. Simply bringing these characters together with a shared background and not capitalizing on it aside from \u201chey they all have a lot of chakra\u201d is wasted potential... If you disagree with that, then that just says more about your own imagination or lack of. \n\nYou can claim what I said is a fallacy, and an attack of character, because well it sort of is with that last sentence. My opinion is, there could\u2019ve been a lot more between them, so if you disagree with that, then that\u2019s pretty odd in its own way. Especially considering how much the war arc dragged along, but that\u2019s not the main point anyway.\n\n>Should sarada care about the Uchiha massacre?\n\nUm, yes? The massacre that her own uncle participated in, and the same massacre that left her father as an orphan? Yes, she should care about it. Do you disagree? \n\n>Is it bad writing?\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure there was some curiosity between her and the uchiha clan, maybe it was just about the eyes though. Is it bad writing? I don\u2019t watch boruto enough to make a judgement about it. \n\nIf a random Uchiha clan member suddenly appeared in the story in contact with her, and she doesn\u2019t care that he\u2019s an Uchiha, then yes, that would probably be bad writing.",

Naruto, being an orphan his whole life, you think would at least have some questions and want more insight into his family and his lineage. And hearing about Tsunade, that also seems like kind of a big deal. Like maybe even throughout their time together she could at least drop some hints to him about their shared genetics or something. Like literally, something! Anything! Naruto being all alone and ignored was literally his main motivation in life. To just not really address it when he finally has found his family is\u2026.appalling??  \n\nIt\u2019s wild to me to hear that this wasn\u2019t brought up at all.

We know Naruto being minatos son was planned, so obviously jeraiya not talking isn\u2019t out of no where. \n\nWho said anything about Minato? \n\n>Why would nagato know? He was orphaned as a child and the clan was nearly extinct so it\u2019s not like he lived with a clan. Same deal for Karin. Karin\u2019s mother and her were refugees and just used for their healing ability. She was never raised in a clan. And why would any of this matter anyway? Why would nagato care about them being from the same clan? \n\nNagato cared about Naruto being a student of his Sensei. Being Uzumaki would've surely been interesting for Nagato.\n\nHow Obito knew then? Obito knows about Nagato more than Nagato himself?\n\n>The hyuga are also related to the senju.\n\nOnly Uzumaki and Senju are Ashura's descendants. Ashura only reincarnated into his descendant. \n\n>So any reveal of anything is an asspull? An asspull is something that comes out of no where. \n\nDo we know anything about Uzumaki? Even the members of the clan didn't know that they belonged to it. Shiki Fujin was supposed to be Minato's Justu, however, it suddenly turned out to be an Uzumaki's Jutsu. Can't you see how their abilities are exactly similar to the Senju? Strong Chakra, strong life force, and nice sealing abilities (Tobirama and Hashirama were seal masters). They are just a redhead version of Senju, lol.",

Jeraiya clearly wasn\u2019t interested in telling Naruto about his parents. \n\nThe clan is nearly extinct and spread apart. Being half uzamaki is less of a bond than having the same teacher, especially when that teacher was effectively their father for years. \n\nObito knew from madara most likely. \n\nAsura didn\u2019t even exist in canon until a while post learning about uzamakis. It\u2019s not like the uzamakis were retconned in. It was just unknown history to us that never had any reason to come up.  \n\nWe know very little except they had strong life force, focused in dealing, and were nearly extinct. This made them strong candidates for jinchuriki. The reaper death seal was a secret from everyone except minato and hiruzen who learned it from minato. All we as the reader could know about it is what hiruzen knew about it.\n\nI\u2019m very confused how you believe it\u2019s an asspull. The full uzamakis have red hair and exist before we know anything about asura and the senju. They are similar to the senju which we learn later.  None of that comes from no where though. It\u2019s slowly introduced to us as it becomes relevant to the story. It\u2019s no more of an asspull than any reveal",

Instead of the usual sitting in seat waiting for someone to find kawaki.\n\nIt\u2019s a reactive character driven story and that\u2019s usually a bad recipe, because outside of some world ending threat all the tension is gone.\n\nHe\u2019s 33 right now. I\u2019m 32 and just getting started. Even reconnecting with my own ancestral roots.\n\nIt only loses meaning if you make it so,amici.\n\n\nThe whole \u201cmy character arc is done\u201d if you are the sitting general of a nation is kinda crazy.\nThere is ALWAYS something worth exploring and fixing in the military.\n\nNothing was worse than just giving us peace time and \u201ccalming the world down\u201d\n\nOn Taka, he\u2019s not really shown animosity towards Karin, she just kind of a bich. Hell he\u2019s not all that unfriendly towards Orochimaru, he\u2019s really moreso just putting up that front because he knows how dangerous he can be, and that he\u2019s essentially a ticking time bomb, who will destroy when bored.\n\nOro seems to have kind of matured in a way though.\nI wonder if it has to do with kabuto.\n\n\nAnyway. Yes. I think you could have the uzumaki just hiding somewhere. A rabbit goddess possesses the uchiha patriarch, and the series is about aliens and artificial humans right now.\n\nHaving 50 uzumaki survive, and multiplying isn\u2019t that hard at all.",

Relying on the root, to nourish the leaf.\nSasuke is doing Danzo work.\n\n\n\nNothing he has done has shown us how fulfilling positions of command can be. Show us how the village works, explore the world, and make it just as vibrant and funky as it used to be.\n\n\nSo it\u2019s just alien attacks for now.\nNow kishimoto may not have the chops or interest to write that way, but the problem is, he wrote a setting with like no tension.\n\n\nAnd we also have to remember, naruto speaks like a punk. It wasn\u2019t just the fox, he\u2019s also kind of\u2026 abrasive.\nHe\u2019s older, but the same dude.\n\n\nHe\u2019s had so little on screen time with them that it\u2019s weird for him to have a negative opinion, but Naruto forms opinions about people before he gets to know them as a defense mechanism.\n\nThey aren\u2019t team rocket, how much trouble could they have really caused him? He doesn\u2019t even say \u201cme\u201d he says, \u201csomebody\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll lean into the manga since kishi writes it personally, but it\u2019s been ootsusuki time for the past couple of years.\n\n\nSure it\u2019s \u201cboruto\u2019s story\u201d, but it skipped all the good parts to get to the ayylmaos.\n\nSo, pivoting a little and doing some other stuff for a while would be refreshing. \n\n\nPersonally I AM loving the Eida/Amado parts, because if anything, they are both well designed and active participants instead of mostly passive defenders.\n\nSeeing a kage level infiltration and rescue mission to liberate his kinsmen would be lit.\n\nOne thing you overlooked in saying konoha is his family is the world is his family. He\u2019s the head of the gokage. So it\u2019s not like he would neglect new people.\n\nKawaki got a position didn\u2019t he?",

Orochimaru states \"The same power as Kushina Uzumaki, she's finally attained it.\" Implying that it's an ability that they've hoped for her to achieve throughout her training, in which she'd need to know that she's an Uzumaki.\n\nBeing his main warden for one of the hideouts as well as the nature of her abilities + her Intel about the Ninja world it wouldn't make sense for her to not know she's an Uzumaki.\n\n>Where are the Uzumaki? Oh, they were destroyed for no reason (The Iwa+Kumo Collaborative forces is a stupid fan theory).\n\nThey were destroyed for their proficiency in sealing Jutsu + chakra potency, which we know the leaf heavily relied on for their Bijuu sealings... Each of the Kurama Jinchuriki have been Uzumaki, take out the Uzumaki clan and the leaf potentially lose their nuclear deterrent...\n\nWe were never told the exact motive but it doesn't seem extremely hard to deduce why they'd be an important target. \n\n>Why Nagato never reacted to Naruto being an Uzumaki? \"We are both from the same clan, I leave everything to you, Naruto\".\n\nWhy would this be relevant? Their clan doesn't exist, nor have they ever spent a day surrounded by their clansmen... Why would this connection reign over them being sibling students? Especially considering the significance behind that connection being the fact that Nagato has killed Jiraiya, it doesn't even seem like it would make sense for them to have a conversation about the Uzumaki. They know nothing of the clan. \n\n>He should've at least said that. Who are the Uzumaki? Some relatives of the Senju clan.\n\nWhy? Why do you see this as something that would've contributed to the narrative. I'd like an extremely specific answer based on who we know Nagato & Naruto to be and the direction of the story! \n\n>Edit: Tsunade is supposed to be Uzumaki from her grandma's side. Isn't weird how she never mentioned it to Naruto? Why?\n\nNo, it isn't weird at all. Why would this be a relevant conversation for them to have? To the viewers knowledge, Tsunade didn't grow up in the land of Eddie's so why would she place importance in her being a percentage of Uzumaki...\n\nI'm lightskinned, but have about 20% Italian roots. I don't walk up to every Italian attempting to strike conversation about our lineage. \n\nWhat exactly is your gripe with the Uzumaki? You clearly don't have a problem with artists adding in new information into a story (considering it's within every story ever created), so is it that the viewers don't have enough information about the Uzumaki?\n\nIf that's the case, I hope you voted for the Uzumaki clan leader in the poll each week!",

I've asked what would be the narrative relevance, which is an extremely specific question. Please don't simplify my question in an attempt to strengthen your comment, it's fallacious and ratty! Just answer please.\n\nWhat significance would 3 distinct Shinobi meeting and discussing a clan that they've never known pose to the story or Naruto's arc in general? Would Naruto being in the same clan as Nagato mean more than them being sibling students to the only father figure Naruto has ever had in his life, if so, why?\n\nConsidering Nagato, Karin & Naruto were all orphaned what direction would you like that conversation to take? Would it be a simple reference to the fact that they're Uzumaki, what would come afterwards?\n\nHow would you write this interaction in a way that adds to the themes of the story?\n\n>Why should they do that? Because it\u2019s an opportunity for naruto to learn more about his clan?\n\nWhy does Naruto need to learn more about his clan, had this been a character trait of his, wouldn't he have asked around a bit more? Or at least shown a tad bit of curiosity regarding his roots? If he doesn't do it in the show, why would this be significant? \n\nIt seems as if it's an opportunity for YOU to learn about the Uzumaki, though that distinction hasn't been made in your mind yet. A concept that you'd like to see within a story doesn't somehow make the writing bad when that specific concept is not written in a way you'd have liked to see. Which is why I'm asking you a bunch of why questions, people who narratively analyze have very specific reasons for why changes are to be made or how the writing could've been enhanced... You have a bunch of creative opinions, which is fine, but that's all. \n\n>It\u2019s bad writing to have people be from the same clan, have the chance to meet up, and never refer to the fact that they\u2019re related or from the same clan, which is also the same clan that was eradicated. \n\nWhy, how did this affect the narrative in a negative way? If it didn't, how could it be bad writing? \n\n>The fact that it was eradicated except for a handful of people makes the fact that they didn\u2019t even have any reaction towards them being related, or the fact that they didn\u2019t say anything about them being also being uzumaki, bad writing. \n\nWhy? Both Karin & Nagato are orphaned before the eradication of the clan I believe... Naruto is born after the full eradication. What would bring any of these characters to care about the massacre?\n\nShould Sarada care about the Uchiha massacre? So far, she hasn't, is this also bad writing? If so, why? \n\n>And if you\u2019re going to respond in 15 different segments please just save us both the time and don\u2019t\n\nShould be a very quick read, hopefully you have you answers ready :)",

Change it to \u201cresponse\u201d instead of \u201cquestion\u201d then. Your responses are a lot of questions asking why should they do that. \n\n>Why does naruto need to learn more about his clan\n\nBecause it would\u2019ve been a good idea from a writing standpoint. The whole argument was that it\u2019s bad writing to introduce these people to all have the same heritage, and then not give a single care in the world about it. It\u2019s bad writing. Don\u2019t even introduce these characters to have the same heritage and have them meet each other if they don\u2019t care about it. \n\nAt that point all it ends up being is an excuse to how these people have so much chakra. It\u2019s a tool used for explaining how a character is strong or has more chakra than normal, with no other aspect about it being brought up.\n\nThese people are orphans, nagato, Karin, and naruto, yet they don\u2019t care they they\u2019re related? It\u2019s bad writing, that\u2019s what it comes down to. \n\nYou asking me to explain how it can be done better or how it should be written- doesn\u2019t hold up as strongly either. You don\u2019t need to be a chef in order to claim the foods bad. \n\nNext, your counter argument to that would be something similar to \u201cwell if you\u2019re critiquing food, you should have some knowledge of how to cook yourself\u201d\n\nSure, it would hold more weight to what I said. But I don\u2019t need to have such a strong argument. Simply bringing these characters together with a shared background and not capitalizing on it aside from \u201chey they all have a lot of chakra\u201d is wasted potential... If you disagree with that, then that just says more about your own imagination or lack of. \n\nYou can claim what I said is a fallacy, and an attack of character, because well it sort of is with that last sentence. My opinion is, there could\u2019ve been a lot more between them, so if you disagree with that, then that\u2019s pretty odd in its own way. Especially considering how much the war arc dragged along, but that\u2019s not the main point anyway.\n\n>Should sarada care about the Uchiha massacre?\n\nUm, yes? The massacre that her own uncle participated in, and the same massacre that left her father as an orphan? Yes, she should care about it. Do you disagree? \n\n>Is it bad writing?\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure there was some curiosity between her and the uchiha clan, maybe it was just about the eyes though. Is it bad writing? I don\u2019t watch boruto enough to make a judgement about it. \n\nIf a random Uchiha clan member suddenly appeared in the story in contact with her, and she doesn\u2019t care that he\u2019s an Uchiha, then yes, that would probably be bad writing.",

Naruto, being an orphan his whole life, you think would at least have some questions and want more insight into his family and his lineage. And hearing about Tsunade, that also seems like kind of a big deal. Like maybe even throughout their time together she could at least drop some hints to him about their shared genetics or something.

Being half uzamaki is less of a bond than having the same teacher, especially when that teacher was effectively their father for years. \n\nObito knew from madara most likely. \n\nAsura didn\u2019t even exist in canon until a while post learning about uzamakis. It\u2019s not like the uzamakis were retconned in. It was just unknown history to us that never had any reason to come up.  \n\nWe know very little except they had strong life force, focused in dealing, and were nearly extinct. This made them strong candidates for jinchuriki. The reaper death seal was a secret from everyone except minato and hiruzen who learned it from minato. All we as the reader could know about it is what hiruzen knew about it.\n\nI\u2019m very confused how you believe it\u2019s an asspull. The full uzamakis have red hair and exist before we know anything about asura and the senju. They are similar to the senju which we learn later.  None of that comes from no where though. It\u2019s slowly introduced to us as it becomes relevant to the story. It\u2019s no more of an asspull than any reveal",

Relying on the root, to nourish the leaf.\nSasuke is doing Danzo work.\n\n\n\nNothing he has done has shown us how fulfilling positions of command can be. Show us how the village works, explore the world, and make it just as vibrant and funky as it used to be.\n\n\nSo it\u2019s just alien attacks for now.\nNow kishimoto may not have the chops or interest to write that way, but the problem is, he wrote a setting with like no tension.\n\n\nAnd we also have to remember, naruto speaks like a punk. It wasn\u2019t just the fox, he\u2019s also kind of\u2026 abrasive.\nHe\u2019s older, but the same dude.\n\n\nHe\u2019s had so little on screen time with them that it\u2019s weird for him to have a negative opinion, but Naruto forms opinions about people before he gets to know them as a defense mechanism.\n\nThey aren\u2019t team rocket, how much trouble could they have really caused him?

Also why would he run around looking for an extinct clan. Yes he would love a new found family but to Naruto his family was the leaf now and he wanted to be Hokage. He\u2019s not gonna pull a Sasuke and travel the world for years looking for redhead Children then trying to figure out if they\u2019re related or not. Kushina told him the clan was extinct, why would he not believe his mom?\n\nIt\u2019s also unknown if Karin even knew she was an Uzumaki.",

I've asked what would be the narrative relevance, which is an extremely specific question. Please don't simplify my question in an attempt to strengthen your comment, it's fallacious and ratty! Just answer please.\n\nWhat significance would 3 distinct Shinobi meeting and discussing a clan that they've never known pose to the story or Naruto's arc in general? Would Naruto being in the same clan as Nagato mean more than them being sibling students to the only father figure Naruto has ever had in his life, if so, why?\n\nConsidering Nagato, Karin & Naruto were all orphaned what direction would you like that conversation to take? Would it be a simple reference to the fact that they're Uzumaki, what would come afterwards?\n\nHow would you write this interaction in a way that adds to the themes of the story?\n\n>Why should they do that? Because it\u2019s an opportunity for naruto to learn more about his clan?\n\nWhy does Naruto need to learn more about his clan, had this been a character trait of his, wouldn't he have asked around a bit more? Or at least shown a tad bit of curiosity regarding his roots? If he doesn't do it in the show, why would this be significant? \n\nIt seems as if it's an opportunity for YOU to learn about the Uzumaki, though that distinction hasn't been made in your mind yet. A concept that you'd like to see within a story doesn't somehow make the writing bad when that specific concept is not written in a way you'd have liked to see. Which is why I'm asking you a bunch of why questions, people who narratively analyze have very specific reasons for why changes are to be made or how the writing could've been enhanced... You have a bunch of creative opinions, which is fine, but that's all. \n\n>It\u2019s bad writing to have people be from the same clan, have the chance to meet up, and never refer to the fact that they\u2019re related or from the same clan, which is also the same clan that was eradicated. \n\nWhy, how did this affect the narrative in a negative way? If it didn't, how could it be bad writing? \n\n>The fact that it was eradicated except for a handful of people makes the fact that they didn\u2019t even have any reaction towards them being related, or the fact that they didn\u2019t say anything about them being also being uzumaki, bad writing. \n\nWhy? Both Karin & Nagato are orphaned before the eradication of the clan I believe... Naruto is born after the full eradication. What would bring any of these characters to care about the massacre?\n\nShould Sarada care about the Uchiha massacre? So far, she hasn't, is this also bad writing? If so, why? \n\n>And if you\u2019re going to respond in 15 different segments please just save us both the time and don\u2019t\n\nShould be a very quick read, hopefully you have you answers ready :)",

Change it to \u201cresponse\u201d instead of \u201cquestion\u201d then. Your responses are a lot of questions asking why should they do that. \n\n>Why does naruto need to learn more about his clan\n\nBecause it would\u2019ve been a good idea from a writing standpoint. The whole argument was that it\u2019s bad writing to introduce these people to all have the same heritage, and then not give a single care in the world about it. It\u2019s bad writing. Don\u2019t even introduce these characters to have the same heritage and have them meet each other if they don\u2019t care about it. \n\nAt that point all it ends up being is an excuse to how these people have so much chakra. It\u2019s a tool used for explaining how a character is strong or has more chakra than normal, with no other aspect about it being brought up.\n\nThese people are orphans, nagato, Karin, and naruto, yet they don\u2019t care they they\u2019re related? It\u2019s bad writing, that\u2019s what it comes down to. \n\nYou asking me to explain how it can be done better or how it should be written- doesn\u2019t hold up as strongly either. You don\u2019t need to be a chef in order to claim the foods bad. \n\nNext, your counter argument to that would be something similar to \u201cwell if you\u2019re critiquing food, you should have some knowledge of how to cook yourself\u201d\n\nSure, it would hold more weight to what I said. But I don\u2019t need to have such a strong argument. Simply bringing these characters together with a shared background and not capitalizing on it aside from \u201chey they all have a lot of chakra\u201d is wasted potential... If you disagree with that, then that just says more about your own imagination or lack of. \n\nYou can claim what I said is a fallacy, and an attack of character, because well it sort of is with that last sentence. My opinion is, there could\u2019ve been a lot more between them, so if you disagree with that, then that\u2019s pretty odd in its own way. Especially considering how much the war arc dragged along, but that\u2019s not the main point anyway.\n\n>Should sarada care about the Uchiha massacre?\n\nUm, yes? The massacre that her own uncle participated in, and the same massacre that left her father as an orphan? Yes, she should care about it. Do you disagree? \n\n>Is it bad writing?\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure there was some curiosity between her and the uchiha clan, maybe it was just about the eyes though. Is it bad writing? I don\u2019t watch boruto enough to make a judgement about it. \n\nIf a random Uchiha clan member suddenly appeared in the story in contact with her, and she doesn\u2019t care that he\u2019s an Uchiha, then yes, that would probably be bad writing.",

Naruto, being an orphan his whole life, you think would at least have some questions and want more insight into his family and his lineage.

Relying on the root, to nourish the leaf.\nSasuke is doing Danzo work.\n\n\n\nNothing he has done has shown us how fulfilling positions of command can be. Show us how the village works, explore the world, and make it just as vibrant and funky as it used to be.\n\n\nSo it\u2019s just alien attacks for now.\nNow kishimoto may not have the chops or interest to write that way, but the problem is, he wrote a setting with like no tension.\n\n\nAnd we also have to remember, naruto speaks like a punk. It wasn\u2019t just the fox, he\u2019s also kind of\u2026 abrasive.\nHe\u2019s older, but the same dude.\n\n\nHe\u2019s had so little on screen time with them that it\u2019s weird for him to have a negative opinion, but Naruto forms opinions about people before he gets to know them as a defense mechanism.\n\nThey aren\u2019t team rocket, how much trouble could they have really caused him? He doesn\u2019t even say \u201cme\u201d he says, \u201csomebody\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll lean into the manga since kishi writes it personally, but it\u2019s been ootsusuki time for the past couple of years.\n\n\nSure it\u2019s \u201cboruto\u2019s story\u201d, but it skipped all the good parts to get to the ayylmaos.\n\nSo, pivoting a little and doing some other stuff for a while would be refreshing. \n\n\nPersonally I AM loving the Eida/Amado parts, because if anything, they are both well designed and active participants instead of mostly passive defenders.\n\nSeeing a kage level infiltration and rescue mission to liberate his kinsmen would be lit.\n\nOne thing you overlooked in saying konoha is his family is the world is his family. He\u2019s the head of the gokage. So it\u2019s not like he would neglect new people.\n\nKawaki got a position didn\u2019t he?",

I've asked what would be the narrative relevance, which is an extremely specific question. Please don't simplify my question in an attempt to strengthen your comment, it's fallacious and ratty! Just answer please.\n\nWhat significance would 3 distinct Shinobi meeting and discussing a clan that they've never known pose to the story or Naruto's arc in general? Would Naruto being in the same clan as Nagato mean more than them being sibling students to the only father figure Naruto has ever had in his life, if so, why?\n\nConsidering Nagato, Karin & Naruto were all orphaned what direction would you like that conversation to take? Would it be a simple reference to the fact that they're Uzumaki, what would come afterwards?\n\nHow would you write this interaction in a way that adds to the themes of the story?\n\n>Why should they do that? Because it\u2019s an opportunity for naruto to learn more about his clan?\n\nWhy does Naruto need to learn more about his clan, had this been a character trait of his, wouldn't he have asked around a bit more? Or at least shown a tad bit of curiosity regarding his roots? If he doesn't do it in the show, why would this be significant? \n\nIt seems as if it's an opportunity for YOU to learn about the Uzumaki, though that distinction hasn't been made in your mind yet. A concept that you'd like to see within a story doesn't somehow make the writing bad when that specific concept is not written in a way you'd have liked to see. Which is why I'm asking you a bunch of why questions, people who narratively analyze have very specific reasons for why changes are to be made or how the writing could've been enhanced... You have a bunch of creative opinions, which is fine, but that's all. \n\n>It\u2019s bad writing to have people be from the same clan, have the chance to meet up, and never refer to the fact that they\u2019re related or from the same clan, which is also the same clan that was eradicated. \n\nWhy, how did this affect the narrative in a negative way? If it didn't, how could it be bad writing? \n\n>The fact that it was eradicated except for a handful of people makes the fact that they didn\u2019t even have any reaction towards them being related, or the fact that they didn\u2019t say anything about them being also being uzumaki, bad writing. \n\nWhy? Both Karin & Nagato are orphaned before the eradication of the clan I believe... Naruto is born after the full eradication. What would bring any of these characters to care about the massacre?\n\nShould Sarada care about the Uchiha massacre? So far, she hasn't, is this also bad writing? If so, why? \n\n>And if you\u2019re going to respond in 15 different segments please just save us both the time and don\u2019t\n\nShould be a very quick read, hopefully you have you answers ready :)",

Change it to \u201cresponse\u201d instead of \u201cquestion\u201d then. Your responses are a lot of questions asking why should they do that. \n\n>Why does naruto need to learn more about his clan\n\nBecause it would\u2019ve been a good idea from a writing standpoint. The whole argument was that it\u2019s bad writing to introduce these people to all have the same heritage, and then not give a single care in the world about it. It\u2019s bad writing. Don\u2019t even introduce these characters to have the same heritage and have them meet each other if they don\u2019t care about it. \n\nAt that point all it ends up being is an excuse to how these people have so much chakra. It\u2019s a tool used for explaining how a character is strong or has more chakra than normal, with no other aspect about it being brought up.\n\nThese people are orphans, nagato, Karin, and naruto, yet they don\u2019t care they they\u2019re related? It\u2019s bad writing, that\u2019s what it comes down to. \n\nYou asking me to explain how it can be done better or how it should be written- doesn\u2019t hold up as strongly either. You don\u2019t need to be a chef in order to claim the foods bad. \n\nNext, your counter argument to that would be something similar to \u201cwell if you\u2019re critiquing food, you should have some knowledge of how to cook yourself\u201d\n\nSure, it would hold more weight to what I said. But I don\u2019t need to have such a strong argument. Simply bringing these characters together with a shared background and not capitalizing on it aside from \u201chey they all have a lot of chakra\u201d is wasted potential... If you disagree with that, then that just says more about your own imagination or lack of. \n\nYou can claim what I said is a fallacy, and an attack of character, because well it sort of is with that last sentence. My opinion is, there could\u2019ve been a lot more between them, so if you disagree with that, then that\u2019s pretty odd in its own way. Especially considering how much the war arc dragged along, but that\u2019s not the main point anyway.\n\n>Should sarada care about the Uchiha massacre?\n\nUm, yes? The massacre that her own uncle participated in, and the same massacre that left her father as an orphan? Yes, she should care about it. Do you disagree? \n\n>Is it bad writing?\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure there was some curiosity between her and the uchiha clan, maybe it was just about the eyes though. Is it bad writing? I don\u2019t watch boruto enough to make a judgement about it. \n\nIf a random Uchiha clan member suddenly appeared in the story in contact with her, and she doesn\u2019t care that he\u2019s an Uchiha, then yes, that would probably be bad writing.",

Naruto, being an orphan his whole life, you think would at least have some questions and want more insight into his family and his lineage. And hearing about Tsunade, that also seems like kind of a big deal. Like maybe even throughout their time together she could at least drop some hints to him about their shared genetics or something. Like literally, something! Anything! Naruto being all alone and ignored was literally his main motivation in life. To just not really address it when he finally has found his family is\u2026.appalling??  \n\nIt\u2019s wild to me to hear that this wasn\u2019t brought up at all. That definitely just seems like bad writing.",

That and the fact that the whole uzumaki backstory is just nonexistent aside from the fact that it\u2019s essentially \u201chey the uzumaki clan had a lot of chakra and they were feared so these people teamed up and killed them\u201d\n\nWhat the hell kind of explanation is that for the main characters clan?

It\u2019s not like the uzamakis were retconned in. It was just unknown history to us that never had any reason to come up.  \n\nWe know very little except they had strong life force, focused in dealing, and were nearly extinct. This made them strong candidates for jinchuriki. The reaper death seal was a secret from everyone except minato and hiruzen who learned it from minato. All we as the reader could know about it is what hiruzen knew about it.\n\nI\u2019m very confused how you believe it\u2019s an asspull. The full uzamakis have red hair and exist before we know anything about asura and the senju. They are similar to the senju which we learn later.  None of that comes from no where though.

Change it to \u201cresponse\u201d instead of \u201cquestion\u201d then. Your responses are a lot of questions asking why should they do that. \n\n>Why does naruto need to learn more about his clan\n\nBecause it would\u2019ve been a good idea from a writing standpoint. The whole argument was that it\u2019s bad writing to introduce these people to all have the same heritage, and then not give a single care in the world about it. It\u2019s bad writing. Don\u2019t even introduce these characters to have the same heritage and have them meet each other if they don\u2019t care about it. \n\nAt that point all it ends up being is an excuse to how these people have so much chakra. It\u2019s a tool used for explaining how a character is strong or has more chakra than normal, with no other aspect about it being brought up.\n\nThese people are orphans, nagato, Karin, and naruto, yet they don\u2019t care they they\u2019re related? It\u2019s bad writing, that\u2019s what it comes down to. \n\nYou asking me to explain how it can be done better or how it should be written- doesn\u2019t hold up as strongly either. You don\u2019t need to be a chef in order to claim the foods bad. \n\nNext, your counter argument to that would be something similar to \u201cwell if you\u2019re critiquing food, you should have some knowledge of how to cook yourself\u201d\n\nSure, it would hold more weight to what I said. But I don\u2019t need to have such a strong argument. Simply bringing these characters together with a shared background and not capitalizing on it aside from \u201chey they all have a lot of chakra\u201d is wasted potential... If you disagree with that, then that just says more about your own imagination or lack of. \n\nYou can claim what I said is a fallacy, and an attack of character, because well it sort of is with that last sentence. My opinion is, there could\u2019ve been a lot more between them, so if you disagree with that, then that\u2019s pretty odd in its own way. Especially considering how much the war arc dragged along, but that\u2019s not the main point anyway.\n\n>Should sarada care about the Uchiha massacre?\n\nUm, yes? The massacre that her own uncle participated in, and the same massacre that left her father as an orphan? Yes, she should care about it. Do you disagree? \n\n>Is it bad writing?\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure there was some curiosity between her and the uchiha clan, maybe it was just about the eyes though. Is it bad writing? I don\u2019t watch boruto enough to make a judgement about it. \n\nIf a random Uchiha clan member suddenly appeared in the story in contact with her, and she doesn\u2019t care that he\u2019s an Uchiha, then yes, that would probably be bad writing.",

It\u2019s not like the uzamakis were retconned in.

This made them strong candidates for jinchuriki. The reaper death seal was a secret from everyone except minato and hiruzen who learned it from minato. All we as the reader could know about it is what hiruzen knew about it.\n\nI\u2019m very confused how you believe it\u2019s an asspull. The full uzamakis have red hair and exist before we know anything about asura and the senju. They are similar to the senju which we learn later.  None of that comes from no where though.

It\u2019s not like the uzamakis were retconned in. It was just unknown history to us that never had any reason to come up.  \n\nWe know very little except they had strong life force, focused in dealing, and were nearly extinct. This made them strong candidates for jinchuriki. The reaper death seal was a secret from everyone except minato and hiruzen who learned it from minato. All we as the reader could know about it is what hiruzen knew about it.\n\nI\u2019m very confused how you believe it\u2019s an asspull. The full uzamakis have red hair and exist before we know anything about asura and the senju. They are similar to the senju which we learn later.  None of that comes from no where though.
