    "body": "[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/sjkcbq/sb_just_texted_that_she_miscarried_this_morning/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\nLots of you replied to my earlier post and provided advice and words of support at a difficult time. Some people also shared their own experience of miscarriage and I am grateful for that. I don't think I can thank you all enough. \n\n\nArrangements have always felt magical to me, the planning and anticipation before the date, the feverish excitement,\u00a0 the lust and romance,\u00a0 the feeling of escape and then the 'comedown' to real life. \n\n\nI have felt safe and secure in this fantasy world. All the chaos was always on the outside. Over time, I had almost forgotten that the characters in this fantasy were real, and vulnerable to real life events.\u00a0 \n\n\nOn Thursday, real life and fantasy collided in spectacular fashion. \"I had a miscarriage this morning\", a text flashed from my SB on my phone screen.\u00a0 Those six words were enough to jolt me back to reality. \n\n\nI went to see her on Friday. She only had enough energy to come and sit in the car and it wasn't until late in the evening that she was able to see me. She walked out of\u00a0 her house looking beautiful as ever, hugging a hot water bottle, and an oversized coat draped over her shoulders,\u00a0 hiding her pain so well that a passerby would have never guessed what she had been through. \n\n\nShe looked at me and tried to smile but I could see that even the short walk to the car was an effort for her.\u00a0 I stepped close and hugged her. As we got in the car, she looked visibly weak and shaken. \n\n\nI have only ever seen her at her best, smiling, full of life with the nonchalant attitude of a young person, so it was heartbreaking to see her so broken and vulnerable. \n\n\nShe started talking about her ordeal, the excruciating pain she suffered for hours, confusion about what was happening to her body, the phone call for the medics and the complete surprise and horror at the realisation that she had just had a miscarriage when she didn't even know she was pregnant. \n\n\nWe talked and held each other, perhaps searching for comfort in each other that we are both so familiar with. Adversity brought us closer. If I loved her before then I love her even more now.\n\n\nI asked her if she needed anything and she said she only needed sanitary pads and ibuprofen, I almost cried. \n\n\nI have made sure that she is comfortable for now and won't need anything for a while. Her meals are also taken care of so she won't have to cook. Her PPM continues at the same frequency as before whether we meet or not plus she has extra to spend on herself. Some of you suggested arranging therapy so this is something I will discuss with her in a week or two. I will be seeing her throughout the next week, even if it is just to sit in the car and talk. \n\n\nHaving said all of that, the reality of the situation is that no matter how much I do for her, she will have to deal with the physical and emotional trauma of miscarriage on her own, while I remain almost unscathed, and for that, I feel tremendous guilt and sadness",

If you want to do something extra and special for her, consider putting together an at home gift basket of self care items she can use to make herself feel better at her own pace. Fuzzy socks, chocolate and snacks, spa stuff like face masks, a stuffed animal, a book or a movie (without any sensitive topics of course). I had a SD do this when I had a concussion that put me out of service for a few weeks, at no fault of either of us, and it made me feel like he both understood that my health was a priority and made me feel like I could take care of myself and feel more human at my own pace.",
