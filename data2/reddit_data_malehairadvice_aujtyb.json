Aside from that, short sides, longer on top, and just having a head of hair that agrees with that style. \n\nFor the wet/shiny look, a paste or pomade would be good at keeping it all together like that, and has a med-strong hold.",

Meat in general is the tastiest, especially steaks called \"fiorentina\". The other cities you said are pretty unknown abroad so you will not encounter a lot of tourists, especially in this period of the year. For more \"hidden\" places asks to the people you work with or, in general, older people, they dont speak English very well, but they know best their place more than everyone else. Anyway none of these cities is famous to trick or sell crap to tourists, watch out in Rome and Naples tho or anything that sounds too \"touristy\" if you know what I mean. Sorry if I couldn't help you more but Italy is bigger than it seems so it's difficult to know well all the cities and all the hidden things it has to offer. Really hope you will enjoy yourself! ",

This is the kind of cut you don't want to go to a vanilla barber for.  Go to a stylist and tell them what you're working toward.  They'll cut it to keep it clean and light but not shorten it.  \n\nFor styling, it depends on your hair type but wax or paste are common.  Gel will work but you'll have teenage helmet head.  \n\nAlso, be sure to use a good conditioner.  My hair tends to get really dry in winter so I occasionally do a deep conditioning with coconut oil.  \n\nYou'll get best results if you invest in some brushes (again, somewhat depending on your hair type so do the google).

Meat in general is the tastiest, especially steaks called \"fiorentina\". The other cities you said are pretty unknown abroad so you will not encounter a lot of tourists, especially in this period of the year. For more \"hidden\" places asks to the people you work with or, in general, older people, they dont speak English very well, but they know best their place more than everyone else. Anyway none of these cities is famous to trick or sell crap to tourists, watch out in Rome and Naples tho or anything that sounds too \"touristy\" if you know what I mean. Sorry if I couldn't help you more but Italy is bigger than it seems so it's difficult to know well all the cities and all the hidden things it has to offer. Really hope you will enjoy yourself! ",

Meat in general is the tastiest, especially steaks called \"fiorentina\". The other cities you said are pretty unknown abroad so you will not encounter a lot of tourists, especially in this period of the year. For more \"hidden\" places asks to the people you work with or, in general, older people, they dont speak English very well, but they know best their place more than everyone else. Anyway none of these cities is famous to trick or sell crap to tourists, watch out in Rome and Naples tho or anything that sounds too \"touristy\" if you know what I mean. Sorry if I couldn't help you more but Italy is bigger than it seems so it's difficult to know well all the cities and all the hidden things it has to offer. Really hope you will enjoy yourself! ",

Meat in general is the tastiest, especially steaks called \"fiorentina\". The other cities you said are pretty unknown abroad so you will not encounter a lot of tourists, especially in this period of the year. For more \"hidden\" places asks to the people you work with or, in general, older people, they dont speak English very well, but they know best their place more than everyone else. Anyway none of these cities is famous to trick or sell crap to tourists, watch out in Rome and Naples tho or anything that sounds too \"touristy\" if you know what I mean. Sorry if I couldn't help you more but Italy is bigger than it seems so it's difficult to know well all the cities and all the hidden things it has to offer. Really hope you will enjoy yourself! ",
