    "body": "It's been a while... I know I shouldn't have kept y'all waiting, but I'm here now.\n\nThis isn't one of my normal *flowery-singing-my-SD's-praises* posts. (We're still together, though. Fret not, world! The sun still shines in Duloc.)\n\nThis is a post about the importance of safety.\n\nBabies, babies, babies. For the first time in quite some time, I have become afraid for the safety of an entire group of people I do not know, and I'm a teacher, so this is saying a lot.  I've seen an influx of posts about meeting SD's at their houses for meet and greets, strange tales of women inherently trusting men with their bodies because the promise of cash is too much to resist, and overall tomfoolery when it comes to being prepared for the worst yet expecting the best.\n\nI don't know if anyone feels the same way, but I'm going to say it because I want to: If you do not hold yourself, your safety, your sanity, your body in higher regard than a couple of bucks or the promise of a grand life, *you do not belong in the bowl*. I can preach all day about the types of precautions you can take, but I cannot instill a shred of **common-fucking-sense** into your heads about the absolute danger you can put yourself in if you are not wise.\n\nOne rule I stick to is this: If I wouldn't be okay with it when I'm vanilla dating, I'm definitely not going to be okay with it while sugaring. If a man were to approach you in the vanilla world and say, *\"You can never see my face, but I expect you to obey everything I ask you to do\"*, you would normally snatch your purse, politely tell the man to find a toilet to stick his head in and flush it multiple times. Right?! So, what about this section of dating clouds your judgment?\n\nPerhaps there was no discernment or sound judgment there, to begin with.\n\nAnd that, my dears, is the root of the problem. Hop out while you can, and before you get yourself hurt.\n\n\\[End of scene. Lights go down.\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: for clarity, this is not to victim-blame or shame. This is for those who willingly ignore the advice tabs or go into the bowl without first knowing about the necessity of safety. ",

            "body": "This is a timely post. \n\nSafety is everything. There are some mistakes that lead to situations you can never take back. People who are savvy get hurt while sugaring. \n\nI went hiking with an SD. He kept going on about how harmless he was (he was), and how he didn\u2019t understand how women in the bowl didn\u2019t just GET that about him. I told him that his ego being bruised was not enough of a reason for anyone to risk their safety over....He kept going on about it. Until I said, \u201cyou know SBs get raped, sexually assaulted, drugged, beaten and emotionally and physically used right?\u201d So, I say to all the newbies who aren\u2019t hearing the supportive warnings. \n\nSBs get raped. They get sexually assaulted. Drugged. Verbally, physically assaulted. Used physically and emotionally. \n\nDoes all of this happen to everyone. No. Does it happen because sugaring creates a heaven for predators and entitled men. Yes. \n\n...except the being used physically and emotionally, that\u2019s just a given because that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. \n\nAny SB in the bowl better have her wits about her, and understand the inherent and opportunistic risk that sugaring creates for women. Even if you\u2019re vigilant you can still get hurt. It\u2019s not all dinners, handbags and sweet cuddles.",

I ended up declining to meet him because he intimated that he was into rough sex, and that\u2019s not for me. My vagina is a delicate flower lol. He lost his mind. He kept sending me screenshots of my profile, threats to my life, the things he said to me were alarming and abusive. I ghosted him, but he found other ways to get to me. I reported him to SA, and they booted him off. He kept making fake accounts to harass me. [We spoke on the phone 2 times and never met FYI]. \nAnyways, I eventually told him I was talking to the police which I wasn\u2019t, but it was my next step. I\u2019m lucky that he left me alone after that.\n\nIf I ever receive a threat to my life again, the police will be my first step. It was a learning experience.",

Always carry pepper spray - they sell ones that also have a window breaker & seat belt cutter on amazon.\nIf you have a trusted friend or relative have them sit near by in disguise if you want to be extra safe my friend & I did this in the beginning of our sugar dating it worked well eventually once I was established with my SD I even let my friend meet him. \n\nIf you don't have sugar friends this would be a good place to search for some :)",

He kept sending me screenshots of my profile, threats to my life, the things he said to me were alarming and abusive. I ghosted him, but he found other ways to get to me. I reported him to SA, and they booted him off. He kept making fake accounts to harass me.
