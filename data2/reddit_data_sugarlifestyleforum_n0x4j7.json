    "body": "So I thought it would be interesting to try an alternative to SA for my SB search.  Within a few hours of setting up a profile and sending out some messages, I was contacted by many \"ladies\" who are located on the other side of the country based on their profiles, but just so happen to be \"visiting\" my city (lucky me, right?).  I started speaking with one who was local and everything seemed to be going well and we had a plan to meet at a park nearby the next day, but then as our conversation was closing she informed me that for her safety I needed to go to some site called [certifiedmatchingagreements.com](https://certifiedmatchingagreements.com) to prove who I was.  Only requires a credit card number (convenient, isn't it?).  Once I expressed my hesitance to provide this  information, \"she\" proceeded to inform my how safe it was since they used various techniques on the site to keep my info safe.  Amazing how she all of a sudden became an expert on this particular site and then proceeded to guilt trip me into using it since apparently I didn't trust her, of course I stated the irony that she doesn't trust me, hence the site.  Crickets after that.   \n\nMy fun wasn't over yet!!  Lo and behold, another person interested in meeting wanted to get together, but wanted to video chat first.  I thought, why not, so we chatted and I explained what I was looking for with her quickly moving to a more detailed conversation about intimate desires.  After the conversation, I received an email with part of the conversation recorded and a friendly request for compensation so that this video doesn't make it out on social media (weird since I didn't give her my name and used a burner number to contact her).  I unfortunately had to disappoint her with stating the fact that I am a divorced, successful day-trader, living in a gated community, thus making the whole attempt to damage my life futile.\n\nWell, that was enough fun for me and I deleted the account.  6 hours with an account on Ashley Madison, must be a record.   Also, is it just me or is this site some sort of minor league for scammers?  Thanks for reading my rant.  You have been warned.",

But the fact that the perpetrator is almost assuredly in another jurisdiction and the fact that they're using the Internet to perpetrate the fraud makes it outside the jurisdiction of local police agencies (unless one has a joint financial crimes task force they're operating out of). A department such a LAPD or NYPD *might* have the capability of investigating something like this, but these departments don't even investigate minor home burglaries these days. Something like this will get filed. Permanently.\n\nThat leaves the FBI and/or the US Secret Service. And they just have bigger fish to fry than an individual being defrauded out of a few dollars. IF (and that's a BIG IF) a collection of victims came forward and filed complaints, then they might open a case and try do something about it. Given the nature of the activity being undertaken in which the fraud is perpetrated, however, that's not likely.\n\nThe most effective way to have it dealt with is through complaints to the credit card companies and/or chargebacks. Once enough of those are launched, the CC company itself will suspend the ability of the fraudster to do business (at which point they'll just open up a new account, etc.). Until and unless it gets to the point where it's costing the CC companies some serious money, they're not going to worry about, either. It's a cost of doing business for them. \n\nIn other words, it is almost assuredly a waste of time to get your local PD involved in it.",

But the fact that the perpetrator is almost assuredly in another jurisdiction and the fact that they're using the Internet to perpetrate the fraud makes it outside the jurisdiction of local police agencies (unless one has a joint financial crimes task force they're operating out of). A department such a LAPD or NYPD *might* have the capability of investigating something like this, but these departments don't even investigate minor home burglaries these days. Something like this will get filed. Permanently.\n\nThat leaves the FBI and/or the US Secret Service. And they just have bigger fish to fry than an individual being defrauded out of a few dollars. IF (and that's a BIG IF) a collection of victims came forward and filed complaints, then they might open a case and try do something about it. Given the nature of the activity being undertaken in which the fraud is perpetrated, however, that's not likely.\n\nThe most effective way to have it dealt with is through complaints to the credit card companies and/or chargebacks. Once enough of those are launched, the CC company itself will suspend the ability of the fraudster to do business (at which point they'll just open up a new account, etc.). Until and unless it gets to the point where it's costing the CC companies some serious money, they're not going to worry about, either. It's a cost of doing business for them. \n\nIn other words, it is almost assuredly a waste of time to get your local PD involved in it.",
