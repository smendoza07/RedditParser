I have thin or \"fine\" hair and have seen a world of difference in how healthy my hair feels and how much more full it looks. I just use water to \"clean\" my hair. The first two or three months were gross for my hair and the skin near my scalp definitely didn't enjoy the transition - I allowed myself to use the occasional dry shampoo during this time when I was desperate.\n\nYMMV, but in my experience removing those products was the best thing I did for my hair and scalp. The woman who cuts my hair and has been with me for over 10 years of hairstyles is still impressed at how the no-poo has worked out for me. I'm in the process of growing it out so we'll see how it translates to longer hair.",

I have thin or \"fine\" hair and have seen a world of difference in how healthy my hair feels and how much more full it looks. I just use water to \"clean\" my hair. The first two or three months were gross for my hair and the skin near my scalp definitely didn't enjoy the transition - I allowed myself to use the occasional dry shampoo during this time when I was desperate.\n\nYMMV, but in my experience removing those products was the best thing I did for my hair and scalp. The woman who cuts my hair and has been with me for over 10 years of hairstyles is still impressed at how the no-poo has worked out for me. I'm in the process of growing it out so we'll see how it translates to longer hair.",

I have thin or \"fine\" hair and have seen a world of difference in how healthy my hair feels and how much more full it looks. I just use water to \"clean\" my hair. The first two or three months were gross for my hair and the skin near my scalp definitely didn't enjoy the transition - I allowed myself to use the occasional dry shampoo during this time when I was desperate.\n\nYMMV, but in my experience removing those products was the best thing I did for my hair and scalp. The woman who cuts my hair and has been with me for over 10 years of hairstyles is still impressed at how the no-poo has worked out for me. I'm in the process of growing it out so we'll see how it translates to longer hair.",

I have thin or \"fine\" hair and have seen a world of difference in how healthy my hair feels and how much more full it looks. I just use water to \"clean\" my hair. The first two or three months were gross for my hair and the skin near my scalp definitely didn't enjoy the transition - I allowed myself to use the occasional dry shampoo during this time when I was desperate.\n\nYMMV, but in my experience removing those products was the best thing I did for my hair and scalp. The woman who cuts my hair and has been with me for over 10 years of hairstyles is still impressed at how the no-poo has worked out for me. I'm in the process of growing it out so we'll see how it translates to longer hair.",
