I pulled [this image](https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/newscms/2019_37/1479875/argan-oil-today-main-190909.jpg) off the internet to show you what I mean. I recommend ones with argan oil as the essential ingredient. Thin hair is hard to control; with product, a person can end up with hair helmet or excessive volume; without product, thin hair blows around and ends up a mess. Wax can be useful to help control thin hair with a dry look so you don't end up looking like you are going out to the club to do daily errands. The real trick is finding the right wax for thin hair and applying it evenly. If a person tries to put the wax in as a clump and then combs it out it will look terrible, like someone hit you in the head with an egg. The way I apply it evenly is to rub a nickel sized dab over the inside of my hands, palm and fingers, and then press both hands into my hair and move them back once and then I comb it in.",

All good looks, two\u2013long and short\u2013are standouts. So then the question is what is your goal?\n\nLong is relaxed and not worried about a lot. Short is laser-focused, objectives in front of mind.\n\nIMO you look terrific either way. One (long) communicates I\u2019m good, the other (short) communicates I\u2019m going.\n\nMy best advice is check in with your future self, see what they want you to bring them (skills, accomplishments, experiences) and then choose accordingly. Again, you look great, leader.",

I recommend ones with argan oil as the essential ingredient. Thin hair is hard to control; with product, a person can end up with hair helmet or excessive volume; without product, thin hair blows around and ends up a mess. Wax can be useful to help control thin hair with a dry look so you don't end up looking like you are going out to the club to do daily errands. The real trick is finding the right wax for thin hair and applying it evenly. If a person tries to put the wax in as a clump and then combs it out it will look terrible, like someone hit you in the head with an egg. The way I apply it evenly is to rub a nickel sized dab over the inside of my hands, palm and fingers, and then press both hands into my hair and move them back once and then I comb it in.",

I pulled [this image](https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/newscms/2019_37/1479875/argan-oil-today-main-190909.jpg) off the internet to show you what I mean. I recommend ones with argan oil as the essential ingredient. Thin hair is hard to control; with product, a person can end up with hair helmet or excessive volume; without product, thin hair blows around and ends up a mess. Wax can be useful to help control thin hair with a dry look so you don't end up looking like you are going out to the club to do daily errands. The real trick is finding the right wax for thin hair and applying it evenly. If a person tries to put the wax in as a clump and then combs it out it will look terrible, like someone hit you in the head with an egg. The way I apply it evenly is to rub a nickel sized dab over the inside of my hands, palm and fingers, and then press both hands into my hair and move them back once and then I comb it in.",
