It\u2019s become a weird like stereotype but most likely it\u2019s dudes with long hair just not trying to deal with their long hair on days that aren\u2019t working out. I might be an outlier but I would consider it the same as a woman having a day where their hair isn\u2019t cooperating and just wanting to look okay to get it out of the way. \n\nThis is a sincere question from a dude. Do we hate on man buns for no reason or do we realize it\u2019s just a dude with long hair trying to scrape life together for a few more days?",
