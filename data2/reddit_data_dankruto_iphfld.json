They are definitely trying to get people/kids to feel comfortable with future synthetic people like AI or cloned people and get them ready to treat them as normal humans in the future. So in that sense it has a cool message like Naruto did. I forget what his was though",

Otherwise it's not worth waiting a month for and the first half of the chapters werent coehesive with too many stand alone chapters and idk, Im really ok with the art style, but I thought id be used to it as a replacement for the old style by now. So the anime wins in quality for me too, even though there's plenty of bad stuff but at least it's 1.5 hrs of anime content vs 10 mins of reading a month. The anime is just unfortunately in a constant state of being Naruto Shippuden filler level of goodness. I feel like no matter which one you choose it feels like the show or manga is skimming through borutos life rather than us going through it like it did in Naruto. Idk if it's possible for it to get back to how it was with naruto unless they decide to stop doing so many little two and three episode arcs all the time or the manga goes weekly again. Neither is gonna happen though. I think the show is doing great though and I'm very happy with where the anime and manga are rn. 10/10 for boruto rn def recommend.",

Now you can enjoy the new chapters for free as they get released.\n\nI recommend Boruto and One Punch Man for starters (I watched the one punch man anime, and so I picked up on the chapters starting were the anime left off. I picked up Boruto where the Boruto Movie left off at)",

That being said, they're beginning to properly adapt the manga content and have been doing so by adding new original arcs that flesh out the events leading up to the arcs in really interesting ways. Along with that, the anime is adopting a much darker tone; we've seen more blood this arc than essentially the rest of the anime.\n\nThe lows are really low, but the highs are *really* high, and they're not afraid to save animation budget for some beautiful scenes.",

Every character just constantly spouts exposition without much flair at all, and none of the characters feel like actual people. \n\nIn something like HxH you don't care where the fuck the arc takes place because you're interested in the characters. They have different motivations, and even if a character doesn't have a super ambitious goal, they have things they do and don't care for. Meaning they can drop in/out of the story whenever, and they'll only be on screen whenever they want to be there. \n\nIn Boruto (the anime) every single fucking character is just arbitrarily tossed into a random storyline and they barely grow at all or have any interest in the plot they're starring in. For some reason everyone had a kid at the same time and they all wanted to be ninja because...ninja good? It's fucking boring lol \n\nDon't even get me started on the undeserved parallels, like Shikadai becoming a chunin? Shikamaru became a chunin not only in the heat of the moment, but also displayed a genuine ability to lead people and take the fall for others afterwards. Shikadai could barely take care of like 3 genin without getting pissed off.",

It took me like 4 months to finish the series starting from the war arc because the show wasn't very good. It took me like 2 months to get to war arc, 4 to finish it. When Dragon Ball Super came out, I watched it weekly. It was never good. My brain wanted something a little more deep than a light show staring more shallow versions of my favorite characters just because. I was barely able to finish that one. Probably ruined sequel shows for me to be honest. If a show goes down hill, and I have a chance to get off, I will. That's why I haven't watched Boruto. But I have seen the ridiculous nerfs to Naruto and Sasuke, and one of the major reasons I hated DBS was because of it's god awful consistency. So no, I will not be wasting my time with Boruto. My standards have risen to high for that one. I only watched DBS due to DBZ and DB nostalgia anyways, won't be making that mistake again.",

Tho the anime will add to it in a much better way. \n\nThe anime in total will easily be 450 episodes, i.e. a little less than Shippudden's run, as 18 volumes of manga left, i.e 18 x 4 = 72 chapters prolly. Divided by 12 that's 6 years. Multiplied by weeks in the year 52 x 6 = 312. 300 + 150 = 450.",

Otherwise it's not worth waiting a month for and the first half of the chapters werent coehesive with too many stand alone chapters and idk, Im really ok with the art style, but I thought id be used to it as a replacement for the old style by now. So the anime wins in quality for me too, even though there's plenty of bad stuff but at least it's 1.5 hrs of anime content vs 10 mins of reading a month. The anime is just unfortunately in a constant state of being Naruto Shippuden filler level of goodness. I feel like no matter which one you choose it feels like the show or manga is skimming through borutos life rather than us going through it like it did in Naruto. Idk if it's possible for it to get back to how it was with naruto unless they decide to stop doing so many little two and three episode arcs all the time or the manga goes weekly again. Neither is gonna happen though. I think the show is doing great though and I'm very happy with where the anime and manga are rn. 10/10 for boruto rn def recommend.",

Now you can enjoy the new chapters for free as they get released.\n\nI recommend Boruto and One Punch Man for starters (I watched the one punch man anime, and so I picked up on the chapters starting were the anime left off. I picked up Boruto where the Boruto Movie left off at)",

And considering that a significant portion of it will also be Teen Boruto, I don't think they had time to have as long encounter with them. Tho the anime will add to it in a much better way. \n\nThe anime in total will easily be 450 episodes, i.e. a little less than Shippudden's run, as 18 volumes of manga left, i.e 18 x 4 = 72 chapters prolly. Divided by 12 that's 6 years. Multiplied by weeks in the year 52 x 6 = 312. 300 + 150 = 450.",

Now you can enjoy the new chapters for free as they get released.\n\nI recommend Boruto and One Punch Man for starters (I watched the one punch man anime, and so I picked up on the chapters starting were the anime left off. I picked up Boruto where the Boruto Movie left off at)",

I love like naruto \u201cthe last\u201d movie, and the marriage arc. It\u2019s so great to see our favorite characters in a less serious setting where they get to have fun. Like the filler episode where they\u2019re all at the hot baths, and rock lee crashes through the ceiling while training, and they think he\u2019s a perv. I would love more none serious inter personal relationship episodes of the original Naruto cast.",
