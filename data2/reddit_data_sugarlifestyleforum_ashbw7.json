    "body": "Story time because I\u2019m sick as a dog in bed and I feel like sharing! \nBack in October I watched a stupid YouTube video in which SA was mentioned. I was dating a loser I thought I wanted to propose to. We were together for 1 and a half years. I looked at the website and texted an old room mate who is a SB and asked her what she thought. She told me to talk to my BF and see what he thought. He gave me freedom to sleep with a woman during our relationship so I figured it was worth a shot. He dumped me that day before I ever even brought it up to him. Lol. So I joined SA! \n\nI got a few messages from some scammers and quickly realized this wasn\u2019t going to be as easy as I had hoped. No worries, I\u2019m a patient gal who believes good things come to those who wait. Had a few awful dates. Got some funny messages. Met a dream boat that killed off his wife (METAPHORICALLY LOL) and dumped me when I told him I knew she was alive and well. I never threatened him, I just let him know I knew and it was pretty easy to find her so he should be careful of others who would not handle it the way I did. Maybe you saw that post? Idk. But after he dumped me I had a better idea of what i was looking for and what i wanted. \n\nIn my search, I had started a conversation with an older fella with quite the profile. You ever come accounts that offer a phone, car, all expenses paid, a beautiful home? And you\u2019re like yeah okay. Well I humored such an account. And after a few messages, god knows why, I fell off and never replied to his \u2018what are you looking for?\u2019. Well, I reviewed his page and said fuck it! I replied to his 2 month old message and hoped for the best. \nI apologized for never replying and asked if he would care to get coffee or something. AND HE REPLIED! \ud83d\ude0d we got a late dinner and talked for hours. It was so natural to us both. He was so fun to talk with and such a character! \n\nWe ended up meeting a couple more times before I went back to his place for the night. He wasn\u2019t kidding when he said he had a beautiful home to share! I grew up in a two bedroom home with a family of 5. I\u2019m not a material girl at all and I got into this whole thing to help get myself out of debt. But I will admit it\u2019s such a wonderful change of pace! \n\nI was in a weird place and didn\u2019t think I even wanted to be alive when we started our relationship. He saw potential in me and believes I can be a successful woman. Oh great now I\u2019m tearing up. LOL. You can get through this pizza girl! Well! I told him about how I was tempted to run off to Mexico to see my mom and get my head straight and just like that I was on a plane to go see her. One way ticket. \u2018Stay as long as you feel like you need to.\u2019 he said. He would be waiting for me to come back to him. I spent a beautiful time with my mother and opened up to her about what was going on. She supported and accepted that I found someone so willing to not only take care of me but help me become the woman I strive to be. And I missed him. We kept in touch all day everyday and i never got sick of his messages. On the contrary, I would light up when I saw a message from him. I told him I was ready to come back and he sent me my ticket information. \n\nSeeing that man walk into the airport with his goofy smile was one of the best feelings I have had in such a long time. We had a long talk the next day and I can officially call myself a VERY appreciative spoiled girlfriend! And he is the best boyfriend a girl could ever ask for. I\u2019m so sorry this is so long! I just wanted to share with people who would understand. Although this started the way it did, I can honestly say I care about and even Love this goofy, kinky, adorable man. \n\nTLDR found SA, got dumped by vanilla bf, had short SR with a paranoid metaphorical wife killer, met a silly man, fell in love? Idk fucking read it. Lol. \n\nDon\u2019t give up. Don\u2019t be so closed to the idea of being a SGF! You might be pleasantly surprised! And communication is KEY! \n\nEDIT: I just wanted to add something. I\u2019ve been without a car for the last year. I\u2019ve happily walked and taken the bus in that time. He text me saying he banged up his truck on the way home and of course I was more worried for his safety. He came up to me in bed and told me someone cut him off so he swerved into a pole... then he asked me if I wanted to check out the damage. I followed him to the garage and i was greeted by the car we went to look at a couple days ago with a beautiful bow sitting on the hood!!! That little stinker got me so good! My birthday is on Thursday and this is hands down the best birthday ever. It could have been a bike with a bow in there and he would have received the same tears! I can\u2019t necessarily go posting all over about it no matter how bad I want to so I had to edit it in and celebrate with you guys! \ud83d\ude2d\u2764\ufe0f ",
