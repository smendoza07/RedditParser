    "body": "Tldr: a guy's self indulgent thoughts after one year in the bowl\n\nThree years ago I was happily married. \n\nTrue, the beginning of the year had been a little rocky after my wife was diagnosed with breast cancer, but together we'd gotten through the surgery and the chemo and she'd received a clean bill of health.\n\nAnd everything else was going great. Our kids were in school and happy. I had a new job and was on the way to switching careers after years of effort. And I was close to reaching my goal of becoming financially independent. We were happy together; we'd just gotten back from a fantastic 5-day trip to Florence, marred only by a nagging pain in my wife's hip that made long walks difficult.\n\nLife was good.\n\nOr so I thought.\n\nEighteen months later she was dead.\n\nThat nagging pain in her hip, initially diagnosed as a muscle sprain, turned out to be the breast cancer returned in metastatic form. Stage 4 breast cancer. Incurable.\n\nShe had been the only woman in my life. I hadn't so much as kissed another woman in 28 years. Now, you have to understand that being monogamous doesn't necessarily mean I wasn't interested in other women. I was definitely attracted to other women; particularly younger women or, well, anyone with a great figure. Just never interested enough to cheat on my wife, or take a chance of ruining my marriage.\n\nSo, despite the pain and the loss I was very interested in exploring my sexuality in ways I hadn't been able to for decades. I started dating, using Tinder to find women who were age appropriate, and quickly found the experience frustrating.\n\nThen, I found a sugaring website (not SA at that time). I met \"Rosa\" online. I had no idea what I was doing. She agreed to go out with me and while I understood she wanted some financial help we had no discussion of specifics. I picked her up near her home and we went to dinner. She was very young, very beautiful, and very shy. Over dessert I asked if she wanted to go back to my place, and she said yes. That night, exactly a year ago, we slept together and, for me at least, it was incredible. Afterward, I drove her home. There was no discussion of money.\n\nThe next day I knew I had screwed things up. I asked her for her payment app and I sent her some cash. She was happy with it, and we saw each other two more times before she ended things to get back together with her boyfriend. \n\nThere have been quite a few other women since then. Some just a dinner date, some I slept with a few times, some more. At first I got more emotionally involved in the relationships than I should have been. I had a hard time when Rosa left, while in retrospect she was really immature and probably not a great match. For a while I definitely acted a little bit like a kid in a candy store, searching on SA for more meetings and more dates even while seeing someone I enjoyed spending time with. \n\nI'm definitely settling down though. There are a couple of women.  I see one regularly - perhaps more of an NSA relationship than I'd like but she's beautiful and intelligent and the sex is fantastic. Another, not as much because of my schedule and the fact that she's engaged (whole 'nother post folks), but we chat all the time. Even a third long distance who's fantastic to spend time with. I hope to see her again. \n\nNone of them can replace what I've lost. As I dictate this I'm standing on a park in the Italian Marche looking at the palaces of Urbino and the surrounding hills. It's an incredible view. It would certainly be more enjoyable in the company of any of the three women I mentioned, but there's really only one person I wish was standing here by my side.\n\nI'm sure I'll be back on SA at some point (I've been off premium for a few months now). Perhaps someday I'll find what I had. I rather doubt it, but you never know. For now I'm not really looking. I'm just grateful that there are women out there willing to spend time with my old sorry sagging ass, and grateful to this community for helping me find them. \n\nMy view.\nhttps://imgur.com/a/fcWHwgJ",

Perhaps, you need to look for a more substantial relationship.  Sure fulfilling your fantasies is good, but those women can't or won't fill the void you feel left by your wife.  Only a real relationship can ease the pain a leaving only the sweet memories and love you had with your wife.  An SB relationship will *always* leave you, especially with young girls, void and empty, and for someone who's used to being with a woman, that won't do.  I ***don't*** know your pain, but I understand it because I went through something very similar with my dad.  My mother got breast cancer at 44 yo and was dead at 46 yo.  My uncle married my aunt's best friend, a man in the church married his church friend's younger sister.  Look for someone who was in your circle or your wife's friends that are single.",
