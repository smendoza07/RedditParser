My suggestions are more of the same - nibbling around the edges on things:\n\nPhotos: You have more than you need, but nothing wrong with what you have. The pink teddy bear one is great but may be the first one to pull if you do want to limit things.\n\nAbout me: I would love seeing interests that I can plan some dates/activities around. However, you cover enough of your personality that I can see several fun conversations with you - so a small item.\n\nSeeking: A good description of what spending time with you is like - a vision of a date (conversation over wine or 'non-judgmental' latte) might add here.\n\nFinally, for any changes you make - keep in mind if that will appeal to the SD you are seeking. You really are using your profile to market to him and get him to engage you in messaging.",

You're going to get an overwhelming amount of interest with your profile as is. Personally, I read your use of companionship as open enough that I wouldn't think your profile was platonic. And being more explicit than that in a market as big as NY really isn't necessary or likely to conduce to the type of SR it seems you're looking for. The explicitness of monthly allowance dovetails nicely with your goal of getting a benefactor as distinct from less dedicated/interested SDs. \n\nI would leave as is for now. Your pics will attract a lot of unwanted attention from people who don't read or care about profile text, because they're great (wheat timbs life). But for the rest it'll filter out some guys who are interested in something less involved or shorter duration. \n\nI take it you can afford to wait for the right match so you can afford a finely meshed sieve. It'll take a little longer, but your profile text, at present, will filter some of the less desirables and encourage legitimate SDs to approach you at a level you seem to want by encouraging a deeper relationship with monthly allowance as a short term goal.",

You need one shot to let SDs see what it would be like to take you out to events, because all of your other photos depict nothing but the \"down home\" country girl. If you are looking for mentorship, investment, and education, then you want to appeal to a man who might well wish to take you out on the town or to corporate cocktail parties, and you should show him that you can fit in.\n\nSecond, there were several mentions of how explicit you need to be about intimacy being a part of the relationship. Part of the problem may be that all of your photos show nothing but \"cute.\" Even the bikini pic is a relatively conservative bottom, and it is all made of a gingham pattern. Maybe you should switch that pic out with a bikini shot that shows more sexuality. It doesn't have to be slutty, but it might help convey that you want to be part of an intimate relationship with the right person (without having to say the word intimate).",

I did have trouble finding photos that weren\u2019t already used on the internet somewhere and just as a layer of protection wanted to keep them completely new in that regard, so know they definitely not be ideal.\n\nFor now hopefully someone can imagine if they like what they see in gingham they\u2019ll like what they see in a nice gown but will definitely try to take a new nice dressed up or bikini photo to add sometime soon! Do you think this will really be a huge hinderance or something that could wait a week or so until I get the chance?",

It all depends on the first impression you want to give. Traveler/loves animals vs Flirty/Beach.\n* On the flip side, the buried in pink bears pic adds a fun flavor, but doesn't really add much in showcasing you since you're covered in bears.\n* I'd like to see a full body dressed to the nines pic. All your pics are very casual and I'd like to see the contrasting look. It'll also add to the portfolio since the only full body type pic is taken further away to showcase the cityscape.\n* Otherwise, great job on the pics. A nice variety of settings and unique flavors of you.\n\nText\n\n* Overall I like your about me. It feels uniquely you which is a nice change of pace.\n* \"I enjoy a nice balance of fun and ordering Seamless from my couch.\" This is kind of confusing for me. Are you balancing fun vs ordering food on an app?\n* You might consider adding a short paragraph if travel is important to you since at least 2 of your pics are in other countries.\n* I'd add the Long Term tag to your list.\n* I feel like you could add more to your seeking section. Besides the requirements you laid out, if feels very open ended on what you're actually looking for. That may end up working for you, or not depending on your local market. You might consider adding more details to describe your ideal arrangement. Ideal activities to do together, what you bring to the table/sets you apart from all the other women in your area, etc. Painting a picture for POTs to see themselves giving that to you may help you if the open ended approach doesn't work for you.",

Most people are happy to provide their opinions. (And best to avoid putting it on the profile as it might encourage people to take advantage of you.)\n\n> Is there anything you suggest I should add to make it seem less so?\n\nSomething as simple as adding \"and intimacy\" to \"While the mentorship and companionship are just as important\" can do the trick :)\n\nI agree with Thin-Resolution832, you'll do fine :)\n\nEdit: LeoFrenchGuy brings up a good point, it might help to add more on why an SD should pick you over the competition / why you're an amazing SB.",
