Like do any of these guys remember Naruto? I don't remember the old gen getting nerfed to prop up our main characters. Quite the opposite in fact, progression felt natural and respectful to the predecessors at every turn. That's why it's hard for me to believe Kishimoto wrote this and he wasn't following Kodachi's script for the arc.\n\nBut Boruto has always been terrible with nostalgia. Even the times they get it right they still get it wrong like with the Momoshiki fight where Naruto and Sasuke are kicking ass but no it has to be Boruto who saves the day and finished off Momoshiki. Then they retcon the Otsutsuki completely to shove in Kama to make Boruto's ceiling higher than Naruto and Sasuke's. And for good measure, we get a permanent nerf on Naruto and Sasuke, because the series apparently doesn't think it's worth it to actually show Boruto progress past them.\n\nAnd that's not even getting into how bastardized the old gen as characters (especially Naruto and Sasuke) have become since Shippuden.",

Kurama's death is a plot device to permanently nerf Naruto and if I feel sad about it in any capacity it's that Kurama deserved a lot better than that.\n\nIt's just so wild to me that this is the sequel to Naruto and yet all throughout Naruto, the old gen was treated with care and respect. Meanwhile, Boruto thinks that permanently nerfing the only two reasons why the majority of people over the age of 12 give a shit about their series is a good idea.

I still didn't like it much but at least we would get slice-of-life moments here and there like Naruto and Sasuke spending time with the family and occasionally see the old faces pop up.\n\nBecause honestly at the end of Shippuden, what else would people want to see in the Naruto-verse? People hated the Kaguya Arc and were happy to see the peace. And now they're doing a 180 because?\n\nAnd I can't even find any silver linings. Naruto is so beloved to me because of the characters. Even when the story went to shit during the latter stages of the War it didn't bother me much because I still loved the characters.

I get that the creator and Jump wants to ride the wave while they can, but imho, this ain't the way to do it. Fine, go with the Boruto direction, but at the very least, they owe it to the fans to give us a better storyline and give the older characters the respect that they dully deserve.

But because Naruto was fucking Naruto, Shonen Jump wanted a sequel series so Kishimoto's long-term assistants (Kodachi and Ikemoto) jumped on the project. Ikemoto does the drawings and Kodachi was doing the storyboard. Kishimoto was added as a supervisor but he pretty much all but said in interviews that he was done with the series.\n\nSo then Kishimoto took some time off and started a new manga, Samurai 8. Unfortunately, that got canceled in early 2020 so Kishimoto was kind of left in this weird place. \n\nThen in late 2020, Kishimoto took over the Boruto storyboard from Kodachi towards the end of the Kawaki arc (Right before Baryon Mode and the current episode). And yet when I read those chapters it really didn't feel like Kishimoto's ideas which makes sense considering he took control at the very end and was likely writing Kodachi's script. \n\nUnfortunately, I think it's too late for Kishimoto to write the series how he wants because it's been 5 years since it started and the foundations are set. I think the story and characters will improve but you can't really do much more than that so I don't really know why Kishimoto decided to come back and take control of Boruto.",

Im not even all that upset about Kurama or the next gen being pushed to the limelight, thats fine. Its the blatant disrespect of the old gen and I feel like Im just repeating myself. Its frustrating as a Naruto fan to see this. I decided to keep track and keep myself up to date on Boruto not because I want to, its because i cant justify my rant against it without knowing whats really going on. Still pains me to read each chapter and watch the anime.",

Shippuden ended very conclusively and there was no need to force a direct sequel.\n\nThat's probably why my favorite episodes in Boruto are the ones where it's the adults just hanging out with their kids. If you're going to make a direct sequel make it a slice of life series which revolves around the kids interacting with their parents.\n\nAnd if you wanted a sequel to Naruto with science and aliens you do what TLOK did and set it far into the future where Naruto is dead.",

Speaking of Sasuke has a bunch of rinnegan uses that Nagato doesn't have due to it being his own rinnegan. \n\nMadara got the rinnegan and mastered it minutes after doing so. Nagato had it his entire life and only then started learning a few techniques, which look underwhelming compared to the other user's versions.",

So that is also not an argument.\nGedo mazo is also something Obito learnt in mere hours. So again I don't see what Nagato did so much better.

You said the others are just better because they're stronger and how that doesn't count but now you use the fact that Nagato literally just has more chakra than Obito by default as a testament to nagatos skill? Nagato literally only could use the 2 rinnegan was because of his immense chakra reserve he got because he's an Uzumaki. If Obito was an Uzumaki hed also be able to use 2.\n\nAlso the ability you meant is a one time thing. It literally crippled Nagato after he used it and drained all of his life force. Why would Obito cripple himself when he was only using gedo mazo as a distraction???? You must have been doing something else than watching Naruto cuz u don't know shit about it",

Remember the same Nagato whose cock your gargling rn, needed help of 9 other Akatsuki over the time of 3 days to do that same thing for every tailed beast. Don't make me laugh\n\nNagato had his rinnegan for 30 or so years and Obito for 2 days after which he already managed to use the six paths which you claimed to be the magnum opus of the rinnegan at the beginning of this ridiculous debate. He also managed to use the gedo mazo instantly in full form. \n\nAs I've said multiple times so far, Madara used multiple abilities after mere minutes of having his rinnegan and instantly surpassed Nagato in it's uses. Including perfectly using the outer path which you conveniently seem to ignore as a feat so far. \nSasuke too instantly mastered his personal rinnegan use, pull and push, shibaku tensei and most importantly a genjutsu so strong he captured ALL 9 tailed beasts at once, meanwhile pain sucks ass at genjutsu.",

Also when was it stated that the members received any of that chakra?\n\n>And yet Obito said nothing about needing time to master the rinnegan. If you're going to be retarded why double down on it \n\n\nAre You braindead? You literally need time to learn the abilities. If Nagato is so good, how come he only found out how to use the abilities as a late teen? Obito learnt multiple in a day. That's far more impressive.\n\n> Of course he's not that great at it he wasn't born into the clan of asspulls\n\nThis is the funniest part.\n\nHow did it go from \"Nagato is the best Rinnegan user\" to \"of course he's not that great..\" \n\nI consider this debate a victory.

We're talking about a man so skilled with it (after just a couple hours of usage) that he locked up all the Tailed Beasts in 30 seconds. You have to shut off your brain to look at Sasuke at the end of Shippuden and think that the natural progression of his fighting ability 15-20 years later was this.\n\nAlso a bonus for how lazy the Boruto writing is, Amaterasu is in Sasuke's Rinne-Sharingan eye and yet they let him use it from his other eye.",

The answer is simple, Kishimoto has long since realised that some of those techniques are too overpowered and would trivialise some of the fights, so he is quietly writing them off the manga and keeping them as a gimmick exclusive to pain/nagato. \n\nI even remember the ridiculous excuse Kishimoto gave for why Obito wasn't using them during the war. He simply had Kakashi says \" well he must know we have prepared counter to them \" like, wtf ? \n\nWhat kind of counter could there possibly be if Obito and Madara simply spammed Shinra tensei the size of konoha ( or bigger ) on the alliance from the freaking sky ? Two attack like that and they would have won. \n\nOr how do you counter a technique that let him take out your fucking soul just by touching your head ? Obito with Kamui and that technique would have been unstoppable, reason why he is not using it. \n\nThe same way here Sasuke could simply use Shinra tensei to counter most of Ji-something attacks and work with Naruto to create an opening to grab his head and take his soul, made easier by the fact that Sasuke can teleport. But that would make Sasuke and Naruto as Op as they should be and would take away from is new main character boruto ,so we can't have that, can we ?",

If you make it way after they died then less people will come to Boruto. Naruto & Sasuke bring in easy investment but the story also suffers from Naruto & Sasuke's presence since they're supposed to be in their prime.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't have made it after they died but it would've been better if the sequel had been when they were old, past their prime and lived their lives. Like a Sasuke and Naruto in their 50-70's.\n\nAnd then it can star their grandchildren rather than their children.  \n\nSasuke and Naruto can then go out like the Third Hokage as can a lot of OGs.",

He's also in a powered up state using a power called Karma. He's just commandeering Boruto's body.\n\nBut yes, Boruto was already Chunin level before he graduated from the academy so he's easily jounin level now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>and rasengan is like carrying a ball of chakra that needs direct application to hit.\n\nNo, that is Naruto's Rasengan. Boruto's Vanishing Rasengan is a different jutsu. It literally disappears when it's thrown and then appears right when you've already been hit by it. A far stronger opponent than Sasuke has already been hit by one and they were in a far better state than Sasuke was when he got hit.",

Adult Sasuke is more proficient with his time-switching properties though physical prime seems true, dude is one handed which i understand in anime doesn't mean much but was the start of sasuke's so-to-say nerf, I believe he was too stubborn to accept transplant. Ishiki is no slouch, he's fast, dam near impossible to see or sense when chibi, and restore the size of those rods in an instant\n\nI like where they're going with this, now Naruto and Sasuke are properly weakened for lacking Kurama and a rinnegan.",

Why the chakra fruit planted on earth has a collosal amount of chakra?\n\nA chakra fruit fully grows into a fruit every 1000\u20132000 years so we can assume that isshiki and kaguya lived on earth for millenniums. The chakra fruit absorbs chakra from the soil that is filled with blood and deaths of living things. The chakra in the fruit rapidly increases when the planet there is filled with wars and deaths meaning that humans fought each other despite that they are fighting their own kind hence since humans on earth wage wars and filled with brutal souls, the chakra fruit then increases in terms of chakra levels. Now, Kaguya consumed the significant and special chakra fruit making her the strongest and vicious on earth but somehow other otsutsuki are claimed to be better than her well I\u2019ll try to convince you all that kaguya is the strongest otsutsuki.\n\nMost of us have seen the fight between kaguya and team 7 and they annihilated her by putting their hands on her armpit. If I said so, why am I here trying to convince you all? because most of you guys watching naruto didnt think OUTSIDE THE BOX. Now, one of the reason kaguya got annihilated was because she was careless and got unlucky. Another reason is that she just got unsealed. What do I mean by that? If we calculate the time she has been, it will definitely be damn long Approximately 6000\u20139000 years No cap. Why has being sealed for a long period of time related to any of this? I\u2019ll give you an analogy,Guns -ak-47 LMG RPG any of those destructive weapons and compared it to the future ones for sure the future guns will be more destructive as Technology develops. Thus we must thoroughly comprehend the fact that kaguya has a disadvantage(being sealed) and outdated. So if kaguya wasn\u2019t sealed, she would have develop disastrous ninjitsu that cant be absorbed and difficult to dodge. Even if so she was just unsealed after thousand of years, she would be stronger than Isshiki because she didnt use all her abilities such as using the godly strength from the ten tailed beast. Kaguya did not have the final form of the ten tailed beast as chakra from the it was extracted and divided to tailed beasts. Another reason why Kaguya did not killed Naruto and Sasuke was because she wanted to drain their chakra.\n\n\nNaruto and Sasuke were basically sharing Kaguya's power. Every being in the world had Kaguya's chakra. She wanted to extract the chakra from Sasuke and Naruto as they possessed Collosal amount if chakra.\n\n\nAnd the most Proficient sealing jutsu on their palm\n\n\nShe also needed to be careful because if they were to put their palm on Kaguya,she would be sealed for eternity again. Unlike during Isshiki fight, he did not need to worry so much that would end his career. She would have annihilated them with ease. I mean like Kaguya had many oppurturnities to destroy them but she choose not to. Another huge factor is that she was old. She hasnt changed to another new vessel and her age is ten and thousands of years old. Despite being an alien species(techinically immortal) they are still living thing so they could die. What grants them immortality is due to the fact that once they changed their vessel they reborn.\n\nHere is the abilities of Kaguya\n\nDivine powers\n-interstellar travel, hypnosis, mind-reading abilities, memory-wipe, and creation of force fields and shock waves.\n\nDojutsus and kekkei genkai\n\n-Kaguya has access to the Byakugan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder with unparalleled vision, chakra detection, and aim; the Sharingan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder to create and deflect illusions, copy techniques of other ninjas, detect chakras and traps and eventually activate the Mangekyo Sharingan; as well as the Rinnegan, a Dojutsu that provides the wielder with godly powers of summoning creatures, controlling gravity, ripping souls, reading minds, killing people, resurrecting people, opening portals, creating phantom clones, and absorbing chakra amongst others.\n\nRinne Sharingan\n\n-Allows kaguya to cast infinite tsuyokomi and potentially to wipe out chakra from others, creation of portals and especially utilizing the god tree.\n\nEighty gods vaccum Attack\n\n-Eighty God Vacuum Attack, born out of her immense control over chakra. This powerful and pervalent jutsu allows Kaguya to wield chakra in both a defensive and offensive manner. Using this technique Kaguya can materialize an immense amount of chakra and use them to form massive chakra fists.\n\nThe technique is so strong that it causes rippling shock waves and can even destroy a full-body Susanoo with relative ease. It is also capable of destroying, a complete Six Paths Chakra Body\n\nAll-killing Ash bones\n\n-An absolute devastating power that she has. The ash killing bones will be produced from her palms. This attack is very lethal as it was seen to disintegerate the person into debris.\n\nExpansive Truth-seeking orbs\n\nKaguya managed to build up collosal amount of chakra and combine them together creating this devastating jutsu. This jutsu are composed of Ying-Yang Release, as well as each of the five nature transformations, this huge ball of chaos was intended by Kaguya to be used as a means to obliterate the world into nothing, only to perish them and get vengeance.\n\nWe can assume her raw chakra by seeing how enormous is the truth-seeking orb\n\nAmenominaka\n\nAmenominaka is a power that allows Kaguya Otsutsuki to create new dimensions on the fly and teleport herself, as well as anything or anyone else along with her to that dimension.\n\nHaving complete control over the individual elements in these created dimensions will surely make her a hard oppenent to defeat. once trapped in one it is very hard to escape these dimensions and return to the real world unless someone managed to forced kaguya to bring him/her back or with the help of rift jutsu. The anime only shows six dimensions, but Kaguya can definitely create more if she desires. The disadvantage is that she could not detect the location of the person in her dimensions but she could sense their chakra so it should help her searching them.",

                                    "body": "Oh boy sure thing, I'd love to see your excuses for some of these if you even bother to read them but hey, you asked for it:\n\n* Naruto's character was butchered the minute they needed to push him being a \"bad dad\" for drama and Boruto's character. Naruto, the guy who spent 700 chapters teaching us that he never goes back on his word because that is his nindo, for the first time in his entire life *goes back on his word* that he gave to his own son. He promised Boruto he would attend Himawari's birthday, and instead what does he do? He sends a clone that magically pops from being \"too tired\" all so he can do mundane, non emergency paperwork in his office for literally no fucking reason whatsoever. Naruto broke his ninja way to do mundane paperwork instead of taking an hour to attend his own daughter's fucking birthday like he promised. That is character assassination for the plot 101, Naruto Uzumaki would never do that, period.\n\n* The overwhelming inconsistency in Naruto and Sasuke's powers and abilities. They have been nerfed to hell and back since the very beginning of the series, in that they just simply *never* use even half the abilities they displayed in their final fight against one another. Naruto never again uses Six Paths Sage mode even though we *know* he can still do so because he can still fly, something he also only does I think once in the entirety of Boruto. Never bothers to use Creation of All things with his mastery of Yin and Yang release to create more insanely powerful Truth Seeking Orbs, never uses literally any of his Rasenshuriken and other elemental combinations Six Paths Sage mode grants him again (though this is also because Boruto decided to make almost every jutsu fucking useless since everyone and their mother can magically absorb chakra, but we'll get to that), and never bothers to use the other Bijuu's chakra or even call on the Toads for assistance. \n\nSasuke on the other hand has been nerfed even harder. He's always magically \"out of chakra\" to bullshit away why he can never do anything. He never again displays feats of speed and strength that compare to what he displayed in the war against Madara, Kaguya, and Naruto (something Naruto also suffers from heavily, Naruto moved faster and hit harder in the war as a 17 year old and during the canon \"The Last\" movie as a 19 year old than he did in his magical bullshit \"Baryon Mode\" Kurama pulled out of his ass for him that also magically killed Kurama even though it was established quite clearly in Shippuden that Bijuu cannot die, even if they expend all their chakra they will eventually reform no matter what). Sasuke also forgets about Kirin and worst of all, he just *never* uses all of the abilities/paths of the Rinnegan we know he posses. He never uses the Animal Path for summons, never uses the Human path to attempt to one shot remove people's souls, never uses the Asura path for the mechanical weapons, never uses the Preta path to absorb jutsu/chakra, and worst of all never bothers to use the Preta path to *literally fucking revive people*. The only path he *sometimes* uses is the Deva path, and even  then its only to throw out a couple Planetary Devastations instead of using Almighty Push/Pull even when it would be extremely useful in many of his fights. He is a complete fucking jobber and it's incredibly disrespectful to his character, though I could say the same for many old gen characters like Shino, Konohamaru, and even Sakura as well. \n\n* Handseals and training just don't fucking matter anymore. This one is somewhat more minor, and Shippuden started severely limiting the usage of hand seals as well to be fair, but in Boruto they are just literally non existent. Boruto literally just claps his fucking hands and that's good enough to use several elemental releases at the age of 12 with nothing but off screen training. Several other characters do this as well, apparently everyone is now a god of their respective elemental affinities and surpassed Hiruzen Sarutobi in elemental mastery before going through puberty. Many jutsu are also inconsitent as well, for example during the Chunin Exam arc a random kid from the Mist uses like 10 shadow clones at a time. This random genin from the Mist with no bloodline to speak of somehow magically has more chakra than all of the Kage to where he can spam clones like Naruto without breaking a sweat. Yeah sure thing dude, guess it was too hard for the writers to reread how one of the series most iconic abilities works.\n\n* Jutsu on top of being incredibly inconsistent in how they are supposed to work, might as well just be removed the fucking show at this point as well due to how many enemies can magically negate them. Every Otsutsuki can just absorb chakra and the only thing that works is punching them harder (gee a bunch of super powerful aliens where the only way to beat them is to hit them harder I wonder why people keep comparing this to DBZ). Hell we even have fucking ninja cyborgs like Delta who come out of nowhere that *also* can magically absorb jutsu and keep up with the strongest ninja to ever live. Naruto was considered so godlike he and Sasuke broke the power scaling of the original series, and now not even 20 years later magical cyborgs have somehow been created that can keep up with him in a fight? That is so beyond stupid and world breaking it might as well be shitty fanfiction.\n\n* The villages, their armies, and the Kage are now all completely and utterly useless and irrelevant. One of Naruto's greatest strengths was its unique world building that involved the great ninja wars and the politics between the villages, it's the reason Naruto overwhelming has the most fanfiction written about it over every other franchise. Being a Kage used to be a big deal, now they're all useless fodder that might as well be civilians in the face of all the alien DBZ bullshit. The series has completely lost sight of itself and while yes Kaguya came from Shippuden, that doesn't mean they needed to continue introducing bullshit overpowered aliens as new villains of the week to completely fuck up the power scaling in Boruto. \n\n* And then there's the stupidity in Naruto's actions, something that ties into both his nerfs and his character assassination. When Boruto left the village to chase after Mitsuki, a fucking *clone* of Naruto could have entered Sage Mode, tracked him in seconds, and then flew to him in minutes and instantly resolved the issue. What does he do instead? Sends a ninja team to retrieve them. Okay fair enough that's literally your son and basically niece in danger but sure send some random ninja maybe it's no big deal. Yeah guess what, they got ambushed and fucking *killed* on the way to the Land of Earth. Oh shit moment, my son is actually in mortal danger I should get off my ass and go grab him because with my abilities it would be barely an inconvenience right? Nope, send another team. Guess what, that team *also fucking dies*. Naruto now literally has blood on his hands, sending a team to their deaths over an issue he could have *instantly* resolved on his own, while the safety of his son and niece is now 100% in question and they too could easily die considering they are fresh Genin and experience Chunin and Jonin have fallen to this unknown enemy. What does he do now? Says \"I can't go to the Land of Earth it will cause a diplomatic incident!\" Excuse me, fucking what? Naruto is literally close friends and allies with every single Kage and village in the Elemental Nations. We know for a fact Kurotsuchi would have literally 0 issue with Naruto coming to save his son and help with the situation in the Rock Village, hell she would thank him, but he just *doesn't* because we need the dogshit plot to have Boruto in the spotlight and the in universe excuse doesn't even make any sense or line up with what we know about their world and the characters involved. Shit writing 101\n\nI could keep going with these if you want. Nearly every single issue arises from the writers throwing away things we learn in the original series for the sake of their D level unoriginal plot. They simultaneously nerf the older generation so they can't instantly solve everything like we know they could, but then also introduce increasingly more ridiculous and overpowered alien Otsutsuki characters to try and one up previous villains to the point that it has completely and irreparably fucked the power scaling of their world. It is no longer about ninja or villages or tactical battles or even jutsu, just bullshit alien powerups that come out of nowhere with only a tiny handful of characters even being able to remain relevant enough to do anything about it. And the irony is that the version of Naruto and Sasuke we see fight Kaguya and each other at the end of Shippuden are still stronger than all this, which is pretty telling of how busted the power scaling became at the end of Shippuden and why it was good that the series ended there to begin with.\n\nIf they wanted a sequel, they should have gone the Legend of Korra route and had it take place after Naruto and Sasuke are either dead or legitimately so old they can no longer fight at full strength. That way you don't have to disrespect and nerf older, established characters and can keep things grounded as well with reasonable threats to the newer generation that don't break the power scaling of the world.",

This is perfectly realistic and quite honestly some of the most grounded writing in all of Naruto. \n\n2. First of all, Naruto still has SPSM and he CAN still fly. Im starting to doubt that you even read or watch the series. Second, Sasuke needs all 9 Bijuu to do the Indra\u2019s arrow, if you actually watched Naruto you would know this. Naruto needs to absorb literally all the nature energy of the entire planet to use Ashura\u2019s Avatar Rasenshurikens, which wouldn\u2019t work against Jigen because they were in a different dimension with no nature energy. Isshiki would\u2019ve never let it happen so Naruto doesn\u2019t even try, he slapped and almost killed Naruto is like 2 minutes of screentime, why would Naruto be able to build up the nature energy of the entire planet in that time? The Truth Seeker orbs are never regenerated by anyone in the series, ever. Why would Naruto be able to? He also literally uses a Lava Style Rasenshuriken against Delta confirming he still has the chakra of all the other Bijuu and uses it. The toads would do literally nothing with the current power scaling in the series, don\u2019t know why you even brought them up.\n\nProve that Naruto and Sasuke are weaker than they were in the war, until you do this paragraph is completely irrelevant. Sasuke also uses Kirin against Urashiki. Yet again another claim proving that you don\u2019t even actually watch or read Boruto. Sasuke has never been shown to be able to use the paths besides the Deva path and Preta path (to an extent). Why would he magically be able to pull that shit out now?\nNone of those paths would be effective anyway because Isshiki would never let him use any of them. Soul Rip can be countered if you are stronger than your opponent which we see when Naruto is fighting Edo Nagato, he is able to resist the soul rip meaning it would be irrelevant in Boruto\n\nAre you fucking trolling with the handseals part? Boruto is SIGNIFICANTLY more grounded than late Shippuden and it\u2019s not even close. This claim actually really does make me think you haven\u2019t actually watched Boruto at all. Unbelievably stupid. Naruto literally used 1000 clones at 12 years old without Kurama by the way, what a dogshit argument. Are you trolling?\n\nJutsu negation has been a thing with almost every single enemy since the early war. If you want to complain about it in Boruto then go ahead and bitch about it in Naruto too, keep that same energy. For the Android argument. I guess Dragon Ball fucking sucks too or literally any other manga with strong artificial enemies. Yikes dude.\n\nThe Kage literally were able to restrain Kinshiki and almost kill him. Gaara and Chojuro WITHOUT THEIR WEAPONS were able to dominate Urashiki making him run away lol. Literally fucking read Boruto dude it\u2019s getting seriously pathetic at this point. \n\nThe Hokage can not personally deal with every issue that comes up. This is shown in Naruto too where Naruto constantly does Tsunades bidding.\n\nNone of these claims were hard to debunk. It really just takes a basic skim over reread to make all of these points moot. Consider doing that.",

This is perfectly realistic and quite honestly some of the most grounded writing in all of Naruto. \n\nStopped reading right here since you have apparently completely and utterly missed the entire point. It's not about just being a bad father, Naruto Uzumaki does *not go back on his word*, ever. And he did so, against his own family, to do *paperwork* . That's called character assassination for plot, there is no conceivable defense or excuse. \n\n> First of all, Naruto still has SPSM and he CAN still fly. Im starting to doubt that you even read or watch the series\n\nDid you even read what I said? I know he still has Six Paths Sage Mode, the point was that he literally *never uses it*  when he absolutely 100% should. He can create Truth Seeking Orbs literally whenever he wants, he just never does because lol plot.\n\n>  The toads would do literally nothing with the current power scaling in the series, don\u2019t know why you even brought them up.\n\nAgain your lack of reading comprehension shines through. I'm talking about all of Boruto, not just their recent fights against bullshit Otsutsuki like Ishiki and Jigen. Though thanks for reaffirming why the power scaling is completely broken and the show has literally turned into a wanna-be knock off of DBZ while abandoning everything that made ninja combat interesting to begin with.\n\n> Prove that Naruto and Sasuke are weaker than they were in the war, until you do this paragraph is completely irrelevant.\n\nNaruto dodged a literal light speed attack from Madara in the war, and Sasuke is capable of keeping up with the same speed of attacks as well. Bullshit they cannot keep up with these new Otsutsuki. And in terms of pure destructive power, go re-watch Naruto: The Last a canon movie. The power Naruto displays in his fight against Toneri and Sasuke literally one-shotting a meteor with a Chidori are levels of strength from them that are never once present in Boruto, where they should be even stronger than before (at least in Sasuke's case)\n\n> Jutsu negation has been a thing with almost every single enemy since the early war.\n\nAnd when did I ever claim that was a good thing? Late Shippuden had its issues but the excuse was that it was the literal end of the series and these crazy abilities were from the endgame villains, not something that just casually shows up every other week. The entire situation was supposed to be exceptional and not the norm for the Shinobi world and wars of the past, hence the literal 1000 year plan coming to fruition. You're literally just proving my point about lazy writing, they could have easily *improved* on this and not kept doing it, but they did so instead because fuck it.\n\n>  For the Android argument. I guess Dragon Ball fucking sucks too or literally any other manga with strong artificial enemies. \n\nNo, because Dragon Ball is Dragon Ball and Naruto is supposed to be Naruto. Again you missed the entire fucking point, Naruto becoming DBZ isn't a fucking good thing, and as I said cyborgs of that power level magically being created with 0 in universe explanation a mere less than 20 years after the 4th Great War, in a world that doesn't even have cars or jet engines, is beyond stupid.\n\n> The Kage literally were able to restrain Kinshiki and almost kill him. Gaara and Chojuro WITHOUT THEIR WEAPONS were able to dominate Urashiki making him run away lol.\n\nThey were immediately fodderized by Momoshiki and would be instantly eviscerated by Jigen and Ishiki. And those are the current power levels now, they are only going to keep going higher and the series hasn't even entered a fucking time skip yet. The pacing with the power scaling is beyond absurd and as I said, a massive detriment to the series and world building. To put this in comparison, it's like having an enemy appear in Part 1 Naruto that one shots all of the Sannin and Kage during the Chunin Exams arc and telling us that's who Naruto, who just won a fight against Kiba with a fart, is going to fight.\n\n> The Hokage can not personally deal with every issue that comes up. This is shown in Naruto too where Naruto constantly does Tsunades bidding.\n\nTsunade couldn't enter a world spanning Sage Mode for tracking instantaneously, nor could she literally make thousands of perfect copies of herself all with godlike power and speed. Naruto can, the minute that first team he sent out died it was 100% his responsibility to get the fuck off his ass and go make sure his son was safe and the issue resolved, yet he just sent another team to their deaths and continued to let his child remain in mortal danger while citing a \"political issue\" that we know for a fact does not exist in their world due to his relationship with Kurostuchi and all of the Kage. Please keep making more dogshit excuses for these ridiculous situations that are clearly only there to try and give Boruto the spotlight while throwing out all logic, lazy writers love mindless viewers/reader such as yourself.\n\nAnd of course I haven't seen literally every single episode of Boruto, I'm not sitting through 218 fucking episodes of dogshit to try and sniff out the tiny nuggets you claim are actually good. No other series gets to air for 4 years with such a horrible track record and still get called \"good\" lmao. I have kept up in passing and paid attention to all the major arcs and plot developments, and every single one has only disappointed me further. It's so bad nowadays that watching Naruto or Shippuden and then turning on an episode of Boruto makes it seem like they almost take place in completely different worlds.\n\nYou clearly have no fucking clue what made the characters or this series what they were, which doesn't surprise me considering you enjoy the mindless, lazy cash-grab sequel that is Boruto and \"the old gen getting trashed\" so I'm not even going to waste any further time with you. Enjoy your low effort dogshit, it's just non-canon fanfiction to me.",

Like do any of these guys remember Naruto? I don't remember the old gen getting nerfed to prop up our main characters. Quite the opposite in fact, progression felt natural and respectful to the predecessors at every turn. That's why it's hard for me to believe Kishimoto wrote this and he wasn't following Kodachi's script for the arc.\n\nBut Boruto has always been terrible with nostalgia. Even the times they get it right they still get it wrong like with the Momoshiki fight where Naruto and Sasuke are kicking ass but no it has to be Boruto who saves the day and finished off Momoshiki. Then they retcon the Otsutsuki completely to shove in Kama to make Boruto's ceiling higher than Naruto and Sasuke's. And for good measure, we get a permanent nerf on Naruto and Sasuke, because the series apparently doesn't think it's worth it to actually show Boruto progress past them.\n\nAnd that's not even getting into how bastardized the old gen as characters (especially Naruto and Sasuke) have become since Shippuden.",

Kurama's death is a plot device to permanently nerf Naruto and if I feel sad about it in any capacity it's that Kurama deserved a lot better than that.\n\nIt's just so wild to me that this is the sequel to Naruto and yet all throughout Naruto, the old gen was treated with care and respect. Meanwhile, Boruto thinks that permanently nerfing the only two reasons why the majority of people over the age of 12 give a shit about their series is a good idea. Especially when the quality of character writing from Naruto to Boruto dropped faster than Madara's meteors.",

Yet, you have these Youtube Content Creators like SwagKage and NarutoExplained telling us that we should like Boruto because its actually not trash as they initially assessed (they were right the first time). Im glad Im not the only one who sees it this way because I felt like they have disrespected the legacy that Part I and Part II has created just so that they can shove the next gen to our face and expect us to eat it up. Yes, the next gen will surpass the past generation, but how can they honestly believe that when it literally took a bunch of Dead Ninjas to be resurrected to take down One dead Ninja who has a grudge against the entire shinobi world. At least, in Part 1 and Part 2, they were able to send some of the older gen to their deaths with more respect (Like Hiruzen combating Orochimaru, edo Tensei Hashirama and Tobirama at the same time) and with much more dignity. Idk, thats always been my issue with Boruto asides the copy and paste characters and rehashed arcs.",

SwagKage said he'd try it out but he's still skeptical about it and given that Swagkage cares a lot more about Naruto than Seth does I think he'll still probably hate it. Especially because most of the initial criticisms he had only got worse.\n\nAlso ironically when people were shitting on Boruto at the beginning it was a lot more tolerable than it is now when people are praising it a lot more. I still didn't like it much but at least we would get slice-of-life moments here and there like Naruto and Sasuke spending time with the family and occasionally see the old faces pop up.\n\nBecause honestly at the end of Shippuden, what else would people want to see in the Naruto-verse? People hated the Kaguya Arc and were happy to see the peace. And now they're doing a 180 because?\n\nAnd I can't even find any silver linings. Naruto is so beloved to me because of the characters. Even when the story went to shit during the latter stages of the War it didn't bother me much because I still loved the characters. Meanwhile, in Boruto I don't really give a shit about them even the ones that are OK like Kawaki and Amado. Heck, even the characters I loved in Naruto don't feel the same. Shikamaru is now a dumbass, Sasuke got every nerf in the book thrown at him, and Naruto is forced to do whatever the plot demands him to be.",

There's so much in the Naruto-verse that can be explored and milk the franchise so to speak. There were so many unanswered questions raised during the flashbacks and I wish they would explore those more rather than trying to do Boruto. But hey, what do I know? I get that the creator and Jump wants to ride the wave while they can, but imho, this ain't the way to do it. Fine, go with the Boruto direction, but at the very least, they owe it to the fans to give us a better storyline and give the older characters the respect that they dully deserve. Anyway, Again, thank you for the clarification. I love Naruto bro. I used to think DBZ was the best Shonen Anime and I still love it, but Naruto surpassed it imo and we were treated with such great stories and character development. I hate it seeing it all thrown away for a bunch of copy pasta characters that has no substance to them.",

But because Naruto was fucking Naruto, Shonen Jump wanted a sequel series so Kishimoto's long-term assistants (Kodachi and Ikemoto) jumped on the project. Ikemoto does the drawings and Kodachi was doing the storyboard. Kishimoto was added as a supervisor but he pretty much all but said in interviews that he was done with the series.\n\nSo then Kishimoto took some time off and started a new manga, Samurai 8. Unfortunately, that got canceled in early 2020 so Kishimoto was kind of left in this weird place. \n\nThen in late 2020, Kishimoto took over the Boruto storyboard from Kodachi towards the end of the Kawaki arc (Right before Baryon Mode and the current episode). And yet when I read those chapters it really didn't feel like Kishimoto's ideas which makes sense considering he took control at the very end and was likely writing Kodachi's script. \n\nUnfortunately, I think it's too late for Kishimoto to write the series how he wants because it's been 5 years since it started and the foundations are set. I think the story and characters will improve but you can't really do much more than that so I don't really know why Kishimoto decided to come back and take control of Boruto.",

Im not even all that upset about Kurama or the next gen being pushed to the limelight, thats fine. Its the blatant disrespect of the old gen and I feel like Im just repeating myself.

The zombie thing is completely braindead as \n1) alive Madara has MUCH more chakra than Edo (Edo tenseis have as much as their summoner except it cannot deplete) meaning he could normally probably do more, which HE DID later when fighting Sasuke and Naruto, except he'd have water chakra.\n\nThe six paths are also not as impressive as you state as Obito, the only rinnegan user who wasn't as adapt at it as Nagato was, was able to do it after Less than a week of having it on 6 much more powerful bodies and control the tailed beast included in them. So that is also not an argument.\nGedo mazo is also something Obito learnt in mere hours. So again I don't see what Nagato did so much better. Madara has no use for the gedo mazo as his susanoo is superior in every way, by a mile. So why the fuvk would he use it?",

He said the rinnegan was too strong and he could barely handle it so all that he was super adept with it talk after a week makes no sense. He only knows how to summon it he didnt do what nagato did.

The rinnegan was hard for him to use because it want his and he has low chakra reserves compared to Nagato. But wtf do you mean he want adept with it. He used the six paths. He had 6 Jinchuuriki with him you numbskull. Gedo mazo can't one shot anyone where tf do you get that random ass assumption. And Obito summoned the entire thing during the war arc.

You said the others are just better because they're stronger and how that doesn't count but now you use the fact that Nagato literally just has more chakra than Obito by default as a testament to nagatos skill? Nagato literally only could use the 2 rinnegan was because of his immense chakra reserve he got because he's an Uzumaki. If Obito was an Uzumaki hed also be able to use 2.\n\nAlso the ability you meant is a one time thing. It literally crippled Nagato after he used it and drained all of his life force.

Remember the same Nagato whose cock your gargling rn, needed help of 9 other Akatsuki over the time of 3 days to do that same thing for every tailed beast. Don't make me laugh\n\nNagato had his rinnegan for 30 or so years and Obito for 2 days after which he already managed to use the six paths which you claimed to be the magnum opus of the rinnegan at the beginning of this ridiculous debate. He also managed to use the gedo mazo instantly in full form. \n\nAs I've said multiple times so far, Madara used multiple abilities after mere minutes of having his rinnegan and instantly surpassed Nagato in it's uses. Including perfectly using the outer path which you conveniently seem to ignore as a feat so far. \nSasuke too instantly mastered his personal rinnegan use, pull and push, shibaku tensei and most importantly a genjutsu so strong he captured ALL 9 tailed beasts at once, meanwhile pain sucks ass at genjutsu.",

Stop that weak ass headcanon you keep making up. They spell it out for you and you still struggle smh. Apparently he hasn't mastered it if he's getting impaled here. Of course he's not that great at it he wasn't born into the clan of asspulls",

Also when was it stated that the members received any of that chakra?\n\n>And yet Obito said nothing about needing time to master the rinnegan. If you're going to be retarded why double down on it \n\n\nAre You braindead? You literally need time to learn the abilities. If Nagato is so good, how come he only found out how to use the abilities as a late teen? Obito learnt multiple in a day. That's far more impressive.\n\n> Of course he's not that great at it he wasn't born into the clan of asspulls\n\nThis is the funniest part.\n\nHow did it go from \"Nagato is the best Rinnegan user\" to \"of course he's not that great..\" \n\nI consider this debate a victory.

If you make it way after they died then less people will come to Boruto. Naruto & Sasuke bring in easy investment but the story also suffers from Naruto & Sasuke's presence since they're supposed to be in their prime.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't have made it after they died but it would've been better if the sequel had been when they were old, past their prime and lived their lives. Like a Sasuke and Naruto in their 50-70's.\n\nAnd then it can star their grandchildren rather than their children.  \n\nSasuke and Naruto can then go out like the Third Hokage as can a lot of OGs.",

He's also in a powered up state using a power called Karma. He's just commandeering Boruto's body.\n\nBut yes, Boruto was already Chunin level before he graduated from the academy so he's easily jounin level now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>and rasengan is like carrying a ball of chakra that needs direct application to hit.\n\nNo, that is Naruto's Rasengan. Boruto's Vanishing Rasengan is a different jutsu. It literally disappears when it's thrown and then appears right when you've already been hit by it. A far stronger opponent than Sasuke has already been hit by one and they were in a far better state than Sasuke was when he got hit.",

Why the chakra fruit planted on earth has a collosal amount of chakra?\n\nA chakra fruit fully grows into a fruit every 1000\u20132000 years so we can assume that isshiki and kaguya lived on earth for millenniums. The chakra fruit absorbs chakra from the soil that is filled with blood and deaths of living things. The chakra in the fruit rapidly increases when the planet there is filled with wars and deaths meaning that humans fought each other despite that they are fighting their own kind hence since humans on earth wage wars and filled with brutal souls, the chakra fruit then increases in terms of chakra levels. Now, Kaguya consumed the significant and special chakra fruit making her the strongest and vicious on earth but somehow other otsutsuki are claimed to be better than her well I\u2019ll try to convince you all that kaguya is the strongest otsutsuki.\n\nMost of us have seen the fight between kaguya and team 7 and they annihilated her by putting their hands on her armpit. If I said so, why am I here trying to convince you all? because most of you guys watching naruto didnt think OUTSIDE THE BOX. Now, one of the reason kaguya got annihilated was because she was careless and got unlucky. Another reason is that she just got unsealed. What do I mean by that? If we calculate the time she has been, it will definitely be damn long Approximately 6000\u20139000 years No cap. Why has being sealed for a long period of time related to any of this? I\u2019ll give you an analogy,Guns -ak-47 LMG RPG any of those destructive weapons and compared it to the future ones for sure the future guns will be more destructive as Technology develops. Thus we must thoroughly comprehend the fact that kaguya has a disadvantage(being sealed) and outdated. So if kaguya wasn\u2019t sealed, she would have develop disastrous ninjitsu that cant be absorbed and difficult to dodge. Even if so she was just unsealed after thousand of years, she would be stronger than Isshiki because she didnt use all her abilities such as using the godly strength from the ten tailed beast. Kaguya did not have the final form of the ten tailed beast as chakra from the it was extracted and divided to tailed beasts. Another reason why Kaguya did not killed Naruto and Sasuke was because she wanted to drain their chakra.\n\n\nNaruto and Sasuke were basically sharing Kaguya's power. Every being in the world had Kaguya's chakra. She wanted to extract the chakra from Sasuke and Naruto as they possessed Collosal amount if chakra.\n\n\nAnd the most Proficient sealing jutsu on their palm\n\n\nShe also needed to be careful because if they were to put their palm on Kaguya,she would be sealed for eternity again. Unlike during Isshiki fight, he did not need to worry so much that would end his career. She would have annihilated them with ease. I mean like Kaguya had many oppurturnities to destroy them but she choose not to. Another huge factor is that she was old. She hasnt changed to another new vessel and her age is ten and thousands of years old. Despite being an alien species(techinically immortal) they are still living thing so they could die. What grants them immortality is due to the fact that once they changed their vessel they reborn.\n\nHere is the abilities of Kaguya\n\nDivine powers\n-interstellar travel, hypnosis, mind-reading abilities, memory-wipe, and creation of force fields and shock waves.\n\nDojutsus and kekkei genkai\n\n-Kaguya has access to the Byakugan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder with unparalleled vision, chakra detection, and aim; the Sharingan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder to create and deflect illusions, copy techniques of other ninjas, detect chakras and traps and eventually activate the Mangekyo Sharingan; as well as the Rinnegan, a Dojutsu that provides the wielder with godly powers of summoning creatures, controlling gravity, ripping souls, reading minds, killing people, resurrecting people, opening portals, creating phantom clones, and absorbing chakra amongst others.\n\nRinne Sharingan\n\n-Allows kaguya to cast infinite tsuyokomi and potentially to wipe out chakra from others, creation of portals and especially utilizing the god tree.\n\nEighty gods vaccum Attack\n\n-Eighty God Vacuum Attack, born out of her immense control over chakra. This powerful and pervalent jutsu allows Kaguya to wield chakra in both a defensive and offensive manner. Using this technique Kaguya can materialize an immense amount of chakra and use them to form massive chakra fists.\n\nThe technique is so strong that it causes rippling shock waves and can even destroy a full-body Susanoo with relative ease. It is also capable of destroying, a complete Six Paths Chakra Body\n\nAll-killing Ash bones\n\n-An absolute devastating power that she has. The ash killing bones will be produced from her palms. This attack is very lethal as it was seen to disintegerate the person into debris.\n\nExpansive Truth-seeking orbs\n\nKaguya managed to build up collosal amount of chakra and combine them together creating this devastating jutsu. This jutsu are composed of Ying-Yang Release, as well as each of the five nature transformations, this huge ball of chaos was intended by Kaguya to be used as a means to obliterate the world into nothing, only to perish them and get vengeance.\n\nWe can assume her raw chakra by seeing how enormous is the truth-seeking orb\n\nAmenominaka\n\nAmenominaka is a power that allows Kaguya Otsutsuki to create new dimensions on the fly and teleport herself, as well as anything or anyone else along with her to that dimension.\n\nHaving complete control over the individual elements in these created dimensions will surely make her a hard oppenent to defeat. once trapped in one it is very hard to escape these dimensions and return to the real world unless someone managed to forced kaguya to bring him/her back or with the help of rift jutsu. The anime only shows six dimensions, but Kaguya can definitely create more if she desires. The disadvantage is that she could not detect the location of the person in her dimensions but she could sense their chakra so it should help her searching them.",

Naruto, the guy who spent 700 chapters teaching us that he never goes back on his word because that is his nindo, for the first time in his entire life *goes back on his word* that he gave to his own son. He promised Boruto he would attend Himawari's birthday, and instead what does he do? He sends a clone that magically pops from being \"too tired\" all so he can do mundane, non emergency paperwork in his office for literally no fucking reason whatsoever. Naruto broke his ninja way to do mundane paperwork instead of taking an hour to attend his own daughter's fucking birthday like he promised. That is character assassination for the plot 101, Naruto Uzumaki would never do that, period.\n\n* The overwhelming inconsistency in Naruto and Sasuke's powers and abilities. They have been nerfed to hell and back since the very beginning of the series, in that they just simply *never* use even half the abilities they displayed in their final fight against one another. Naruto never again uses Six Paths Sage mode even though we *know* he can still do so because he can still fly, something he also only does I think once in the entirety of Boruto. Never bothers to use Creation of All things with his mastery of Yin and Yang release to create more insanely powerful Truth Seeking Orbs, never uses literally any of his Rasenshuriken and other elemental combinations Six Paths Sage mode grants him again (though this is also because Boruto decided to make almost every jutsu fucking useless since everyone and their mother can magically absorb chakra, but we'll get to that), and never bothers to use the other Bijuu's chakra or even call on the Toads for assistance. \n\nSasuke on the other hand has been nerfed even harder. He's always magically \"out of chakra\" to bullshit away why he can never do anything. He never again displays feats of speed and strength that compare to what he displayed in the war against Madara, Kaguya, and Naruto (something Naruto also suffers from heavily, Naruto moved faster and hit harder in the war as a 17 year old and during the canon \"The Last\" movie as a 19 year old than he did in his magical bullshit \"Baryon Mode\" Kurama pulled out of his ass for him that also magically killed Kurama even though it was established quite clearly in Shippuden that Bijuu cannot die, even if they expend all their chakra they will eventually reform no matter what). Sasuke also forgets about Kirin and worst of all, he just *never* uses all of the abilities/paths of the Rinnegan we know he posses. He never uses the Animal Path for summons, never uses the Human path to attempt to one shot remove people's souls, never uses the Asura path for the mechanical weapons, never uses the Preta path to absorb jutsu/chakra, and worst of all never bothers to use the Preta path to *literally fucking revive people*. The only path he *sometimes* uses is the Deva path, and even  then its only to throw out a couple Planetary Devastations instead of using Almighty Push/Pull even when it would be extremely useful in many of his fights. He is a complete fucking jobber and it's incredibly disrespectful to his character, though I could say the same for many old gen characters like Shino, Konohamaru, and even Sakura as well. \n\n* Handseals and training just don't fucking matter anymore. This one is somewhat more minor, and Shippuden started severely limiting the usage of hand seals as well to be fair, but in Boruto they are just literally non existent. Boruto literally just claps his fucking hands and that's good enough to use several elemental releases at the age of 12 with nothing but off screen training. Several other characters do this as well, apparently everyone is now a god of their respective elemental affinities and surpassed Hiruzen Sarutobi in elemental mastery before going through puberty. Many jutsu are also inconsitent as well, for example during the Chunin Exam arc a random kid from the Mist uses like 10 shadow clones at a time. This random genin from the Mist with no bloodline to speak of somehow magically has more chakra than all of the Kage to where he can spam clones like Naruto without breaking a sweat. Yeah sure thing dude, guess it was too hard for the writers to reread how one of the series most iconic abilities works.\n\n* Jutsu on top of being incredibly inconsistent in how they are supposed to work, might as well just be removed the fucking show at this point as well due to how many enemies can magically negate them. Every Otsutsuki can just absorb chakra and the only thing that works is punching them harder (gee a bunch of super powerful aliens where the only way to beat them is to hit them harder I wonder why people keep comparing this to DBZ). Hell we even have fucking ninja cyborgs like Delta who come out of nowhere that *also* can magically absorb jutsu and keep up with the strongest ninja to ever live. Naruto was considered so godlike he and Sasuke broke the power scaling of the original series, and now not even 20 years later magical cyborgs have somehow been created that can keep up with him in a fight? That is so beyond stupid and world breaking it might as well be shitty fanfiction.\n\n* The villages, their armies, and the Kage are now all completely and utterly useless and irrelevant. One of Naruto's greatest strengths was its unique world building that involved the great ninja wars and the politics between the villages, it's the reason Naruto overwhelming has the most fanfiction written about it over every other franchise. Being a Kage used to be a big deal, now they're all useless fodder that might as well be civilians in the face of all the alien DBZ bullshit. The series has completely lost sight of itself and while yes Kaguya came from Shippuden, that doesn't mean they needed to continue introducing bullshit overpowered aliens as new villains of the week to completely fuck up the power scaling in Boruto. \n\n* And then there's the stupidity in Naruto's actions, something that ties into both his nerfs and his character assassination. When Boruto left the village to chase after Mitsuki, a fucking *clone* of Naruto could have entered Sage Mode, tracked him in seconds, and then flew to him in minutes and instantly resolved the issue. What does he do instead? Sends a ninja team to retrieve them. Okay fair enough that's literally your son and basically niece in danger but sure send some random ninja maybe it's no big deal. Yeah guess what, they got ambushed and fucking *killed* on the way to the Land of Earth. Oh shit moment, my son is actually in mortal danger I should get off my ass and go grab him because with my abilities it would be barely an inconvenience right? Nope, send another team. Guess what, that team *also fucking dies*. Naruto now literally has blood on his hands, sending a team to their deaths over an issue he could have *instantly* resolved on his own, while the safety of his son and niece is now 100% in question and they too could easily die considering they are fresh Genin and experience Chunin and Jonin have fallen to this unknown enemy. What does he do now? Says \"I can't go to the Land of Earth it will cause a diplomatic incident!\" Excuse me, fucking what? Naruto is literally close friends and allies with every single Kage and village in the Elemental Nations. We know for a fact Kurotsuchi would have literally 0 issue with Naruto coming to save his son and help with the situation in the Rock Village, hell she would thank him, but he just *doesn't* because we need the dogshit plot to have Boruto in the spotlight and the in universe excuse doesn't even make any sense or line up with what we know about their world and the characters involved. Shit writing 101\n\nI could keep going with these if you want. Nearly every single issue arises from the writers throwing away things we learn in the original series for the sake of their D level unoriginal plot. They simultaneously nerf the older generation so they can't instantly solve everything like we know they could, but then also introduce increasingly more ridiculous and overpowered alien Otsutsuki characters to try and one up previous villains to the point that it has completely and irreparably fucked the power scaling of their world. It is no longer about ninja or villages or tactical battles or even jutsu, just bullshit alien powerups that come out of nowhere with only a tiny handful of characters even being able to remain relevant enough to do anything about it. And the irony is that the version of Naruto and Sasuke we see fight Kaguya and each other at the end of Shippuden are still stronger than all this, which is pretty telling of how busted the power scaling became at the end of Shippuden and why it was good that the series ended there to begin with.\n\nIf they wanted a sequel, they should have gone the Legend of Korra route and had it take place after Naruto and Sasuke are either dead or legitimately so old they can no longer fight at full strength. That way you don't have to disrespect and nerf older, established characters and can keep things grounded as well with reasonable threats to the newer generation that don't break the power scaling of the world.",

This is perfectly realistic and quite honestly some of the most grounded writing in all of Naruto. \n\n2. First of all, Naruto still has SPSM and he CAN still fly. Im starting to doubt that you even read or watch the series. Second, Sasuke needs all 9 Bijuu to do the Indra\u2019s arrow, if you actually watched Naruto you would know this. Naruto needs to absorb literally all the nature energy of the entire planet to use Ashura\u2019s Avatar Rasenshurikens, which wouldn\u2019t work against Jigen because they were in a different dimension with no nature energy. Isshiki would\u2019ve never let it happen so Naruto doesn\u2019t even try, he slapped and almost killed Naruto is like 2 minutes of screentime, why would Naruto be able to build up the nature energy of the entire planet in that time? The Truth Seeker orbs are never regenerated by anyone in the series, ever. Why would Naruto be able to? He also literally uses a Lava Style Rasenshuriken against Delta confirming he still has the chakra of all the other Bijuu and uses it. The toads would do literally nothing with the current power scaling in the series, don\u2019t know why you even brought them up.\n\nProve that Naruto and Sasuke are weaker than they were in the war, until you do this paragraph is completely irrelevant. Sasuke also uses Kirin against Urashiki. Yet again another claim proving that you don\u2019t even actually watch or read Boruto. Sasuke has never been shown to be able to use the paths besides the Deva path and Preta path (to an extent). Why would he magically be able to pull that shit out now?\nNone of those paths would be effective anyway because Isshiki would never let him use any of them. Soul Rip can be countered if you are stronger than your opponent which we see when Naruto is fighting Edo Nagato, he is able to resist the soul rip meaning it would be irrelevant in Boruto\n\nAre you fucking trolling with the handseals part? Boruto is SIGNIFICANTLY more grounded than late Shippuden and it\u2019s not even close. This claim actually really does make me think you haven\u2019t actually watched Boruto at all. Unbelievably stupid. Naruto literally used 1000 clones at 12 years old without Kurama by the way, what a dogshit argument. Are you trolling?\n\nJutsu negation has been a thing with almost every single enemy since the early war. If you want to complain about it in Boruto then go ahead and bitch about it in Naruto too, keep that same energy. For the Android argument. I guess Dragon Ball fucking sucks too or literally any other manga with strong artificial enemies. Yikes dude.\n\nThe Kage literally were able to restrain Kinshiki and almost kill him. Gaara and Chojuro WITHOUT THEIR WEAPONS were able to dominate Urashiki making him run away lol. Literally fucking read Boruto dude it\u2019s getting seriously pathetic at this point. \n\nThe Hokage can not personally deal with every issue that comes up. This is shown in Naruto too where Naruto constantly does Tsunades bidding.\n\nNone of these claims were hard to debunk. It really just takes a basic skim over reread to make all of these points moot. Consider doing that.",

This is perfectly realistic and quite honestly some of the most grounded writing in all of Naruto. \n\nStopped reading right here since you have apparently completely and utterly missed the entire point. It's not about just being a bad father, Naruto Uzumaki does *not go back on his word*, ever. And he did so, against his own family, to do *paperwork* . That's called character assassination for plot, there is no conceivable defense or excuse. \n\n> First of all, Naruto still has SPSM and he CAN still fly. Im starting to doubt that you even read or watch the series\n\nDid you even read what I said? I know he still has Six Paths Sage Mode, the point was that he literally *never uses it*  when he absolutely 100% should. He can create Truth Seeking Orbs literally whenever he wants, he just never does because lol plot.\n\n>  The toads would do literally nothing with the current power scaling in the series, don\u2019t know why you even brought them up.\n\nAgain your lack of reading comprehension shines through. I'm talking about all of Boruto, not just their recent fights against bullshit Otsutsuki like Ishiki and Jigen. Though thanks for reaffirming why the power scaling is completely broken and the show has literally turned into a wanna-be knock off of DBZ while abandoning everything that made ninja combat interesting to begin with.\n\n> Prove that Naruto and Sasuke are weaker than they were in the war, until you do this paragraph is completely irrelevant.\n\nNaruto dodged a literal light speed attack from Madara in the war, and Sasuke is capable of keeping up with the same speed of attacks as well. Bullshit they cannot keep up with these new Otsutsuki. And in terms of pure destructive power, go re-watch Naruto: The Last a canon movie. The power Naruto displays in his fight against Toneri and Sasuke literally one-shotting a meteor with a Chidori are levels of strength from them that are never once present in Boruto, where they should be even stronger than before (at least in Sasuke's case)\n\n> Jutsu negation has been a thing with almost every single enemy since the early war.\n\nAnd when did I ever claim that was a good thing? Late Shippuden had its issues but the excuse was that it was the literal end of the series and these crazy abilities were from the endgame villains, not something that just casually shows up every other week. The entire situation was supposed to be exceptional and not the norm for the Shinobi world and wars of the past, hence the literal 1000 year plan coming to fruition. You're literally just proving my point about lazy writing, they could have easily *improved* on this and not kept doing it, but they did so instead because fuck it.\n\n>  For the Android argument. I guess Dragon Ball fucking sucks too or literally any other manga with strong artificial enemies. \n\nNo, because Dragon Ball is Dragon Ball and Naruto is supposed to be Naruto. Again you missed the entire fucking point, Naruto becoming DBZ isn't a fucking good thing, and as I said cyborgs of that power level magically being created with 0 in universe explanation a mere less than 20 years after the 4th Great War, in a world that doesn't even have cars or jet engines, is beyond stupid.\n\n> The Kage literally were able to restrain Kinshiki and almost kill him. Gaara and Chojuro WITHOUT THEIR WEAPONS were able to dominate Urashiki making him run away lol.\n\nThey were immediately fodderized by Momoshiki and would be instantly eviscerated by Jigen and Ishiki. And those are the current power levels now, they are only going to keep going higher and the series hasn't even entered a fucking time skip yet. The pacing with the power scaling is beyond absurd and as I said, a massive detriment to the series and world building. To put this in comparison, it's like having an enemy appear in Part 1 Naruto that one shots all of the Sannin and Kage during the Chunin Exams arc and telling us that's who Naruto, who just won a fight against Kiba with a fart, is going to fight.\n\n> The Hokage can not personally deal with every issue that comes up. This is shown in Naruto too where Naruto constantly does Tsunades bidding.\n\nTsunade couldn't enter a world spanning Sage Mode for tracking instantaneously, nor could she literally make thousands of perfect copies of herself all with godlike power and speed. Naruto can, the minute that first team he sent out died it was 100% his responsibility to get the fuck off his ass and go make sure his son was safe and the issue resolved, yet he just sent another team to their deaths and continued to let his child remain in mortal danger while citing a \"political issue\" that we know for a fact does not exist in their world due to his relationship with Kurostuchi and all of the Kage. Please keep making more dogshit excuses for these ridiculous situations that are clearly only there to try and give Boruto the spotlight while throwing out all logic, lazy writers love mindless viewers/reader such as yourself.\n\nAnd of course I haven't seen literally every single episode of Boruto, I'm not sitting through 218 fucking episodes of dogshit to try and sniff out the tiny nuggets you claim are actually good. No other series gets to air for 4 years with such a horrible track record and still get called \"good\" lmao. I have kept up in passing and paid attention to all the major arcs and plot developments, and every single one has only disappointed me further. It's so bad nowadays that watching Naruto or Shippuden and then turning on an episode of Boruto makes it seem like they almost take place in completely different worlds.\n\nYou clearly have no fucking clue what made the characters or this series what they were, which doesn't surprise me considering you enjoy the mindless, lazy cash-grab sequel that is Boruto and \"the old gen getting trashed\" so I'm not even going to waste any further time with you. Enjoy your low effort dogshit, it's just non-canon fanfiction to me.",

Like do any of these guys remember Naruto? I don't remember the old gen getting nerfed to prop up our main characters. Quite the opposite in fact, progression felt natural and respectful to the predecessors at every turn. That's why it's hard for me to believe Kishimoto wrote this and he wasn't following Kodachi's script for the arc.\n\nBut Boruto has always been terrible with nostalgia. Even the times they get it right they still get it wrong like with the Momoshiki fight where Naruto and Sasuke are kicking ass but no it has to be Boruto who saves the day and finished off Momoshiki. Then they retcon the Otsutsuki completely to shove in Kama to make Boruto's ceiling higher than Naruto and Sasuke's. And for good measure, we get a permanent nerf on Naruto and Sasuke, because the series apparently doesn't think it's worth it to actually show Boruto progress past them.\n\nAnd that's not even getting into how bastardized the old gen as characters (especially Naruto and Sasuke) have become since Shippuden.",

Kurama's death is a plot device to permanently nerf Naruto and if I feel sad about it in any capacity it's that Kurama deserved a lot better than that.\n\nIt's just so wild to me that this is the sequel to Naruto and yet all throughout Naruto, the old gen was treated with care and respect. Meanwhile, Boruto thinks that permanently nerfing the only two reasons why the majority of people over the age of 12 give a shit about their series is a good idea. Especially when the quality of character writing from Naruto to Boruto dropped faster than Madara's meteors.",

Yes, the next gen will surpass the past generation, but how can they honestly believe that when it literally took a bunch of Dead Ninjas to be resurrected to take down One dead Ninja who has a grudge against the entire shinobi world. At least, in Part 1 and Part 2, they were able to send some of the older gen to their deaths with more respect (Like Hiruzen combating Orochimaru, edo Tensei Hashirama and Tobirama at the same time) and with much more dignity.

I still didn't like it much but at least we would get slice-of-life moments here and there like Naruto and Sasuke spending time with the family and occasionally see the old faces pop up.\n\nBecause honestly at the end of Shippuden, what else would people want to see in the Naruto-verse? People hated the Kaguya Arc and were happy to see the peace. And now they're doing a 180 because?\n\nAnd I can't even find any silver linings. Naruto is so beloved to me because of the characters. Even when the story went to shit during the latter stages of the War it didn't bother me much because I still loved the characters. Meanwhile, in Boruto I don't really give a shit about them even the ones that are OK like Kawaki and Amado. Heck, even the characters I loved in Naruto don't feel the same.

There's so much in the Naruto-verse that can be explored and milk the franchise so to speak. There were so many unanswered questions raised during the flashbacks and I wish they would explore those more rather than trying to do Boruto. But hey, what do I know? I get that the creator and Jump wants to ride the wave while they can, but imho, this ain't the way to do it. Fine, go with the Boruto direction, but at the very least, they owe it to the fans to give us a better storyline and give the older characters the respect that they dully deserve. Anyway, Again, thank you for the clarification. I love Naruto bro. I used to think DBZ was the best Shonen Anime and I still love it, but Naruto surpassed it imo and we were treated with such great stories and character development.

But because Naruto was fucking Naruto, Shonen Jump wanted a sequel series so Kishimoto's long-term assistants (Kodachi and Ikemoto) jumped on the project. Ikemoto does the drawings and Kodachi was doing the storyboard. Kishimoto was added as a supervisor but he pretty much all but said in interviews that he was done with the series.\n\nSo then Kishimoto took some time off and started a new manga, Samurai 8. Unfortunately, that got canceled in early 2020 so Kishimoto was kind of left in this weird place. \n\nThen in late 2020, Kishimoto took over the Boruto storyboard from Kodachi towards the end of the Kawaki arc (Right before Baryon Mode and the current episode). And yet when I read those chapters it really didn't feel like Kishimoto's ideas which makes sense considering he took control at the very end and was likely writing Kodachi's script. \n\nUnfortunately, I think it's too late for Kishimoto to write the series how he wants because it's been 5 years since it started and the foundations are set. I think the story and characters will improve but you can't really do much more than that so I don't really know why Kishimoto decided to come back and take control of Boruto.",

If you're going to make a direct sequel make it a slice of life series which revolves around the kids interacting with their parents.\n\nAnd if you wanted a sequel to Naruto with science and aliens you do what TLOK did and set it far into the future where Naruto is dead.",

The zombie thing is completely braindead as \n1) alive Madara has MUCH more chakra than Edo (Edo tenseis have as much as their summoner except it cannot deplete) meaning he could normally probably do more, which HE DID later when fighting Sasuke and Naruto, except he'd have water chakra.\n\nThe six paths are also not as impressive as you state as Obito, the only rinnegan user who wasn't as adapt at it as Nagato was, was able to do it after Less than a week of having it on 6 much more powerful bodies and control the tailed beast included in them. So that is also not an argument.\nGedo mazo is also something Obito learnt in mere hours. So again I don't see what Nagato did so much better.

He didn't have to pick the jinchuriki he could've used his own body for rinnegan techniques. You know who was a walking chakra battery ? Fucking Naruto both Pain and Sasuke walked up and took it from him. If you want to say Tenten Is more skilled with the sages chakra weapons than the gold and silver Brothers you go on right ahead \n\nWhat is your point? Obito couldn't be better with the rinnegan because he has no chakra. I literally explained that already, if he had as much as Nagato he'd easily outclass him. What are you getting at?",

Remember the same Nagato whose cock your gargling rn, needed help of 9 other Akatsuki over the time of 3 days to do that same thing for every tailed beast. Don't make me laugh\n\nNagato had his rinnegan for 30 or so years and Obito for 2 days after which he already managed to use the six paths which you claimed to be the magnum opus of the rinnegan at the beginning of this ridiculous debate. He also managed to use the gedo mazo instantly in full form. \n\nAs I've said multiple times so far, Madara used multiple abilities after mere minutes of having his rinnegan and instantly surpassed Nagato in it's uses. Including perfectly using the outer path which you conveniently seem to ignore as a feat so far. \nSasuke too instantly mastered his personal rinnegan use, pull and push, shibaku tensei and most importantly a genjutsu so strong he captured ALL 9 tailed beasts at once, meanwhile pain sucks ass at genjutsu.",

If you're going to be retarded why double down on it \n\n\nAre You braindead? You literally need time to learn the abilities. If Nagato is so good, how come he only found out how to use the abilities as a late teen? Obito learnt multiple in a day. That's far more impressive.\n\n> Of course he's not that great at it he wasn't born into the clan of asspulls\n\nThis is the funniest part.\n\nHow did it go from \"Nagato is the best Rinnegan user\" to \"of course he's not that great..\" \n\nI consider this debate a victory.

If you make it way after they died then less people will come to Boruto. Naruto & Sasuke bring in easy investment but the story also suffers from Naruto & Sasuke's presence since they're supposed to be in their prime.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't have made it after they died but it would've been better if the sequel had been when they were old, past their prime and lived their lives. Like a Sasuke and Naruto in their 50-70's.\n\nAnd then it can star their grandchildren rather than their children.  \n\nSasuke and Naruto can then go out like the Third Hokage as can a lot of OGs.",

He's also in a powered up state using a power called Karma. He's just commandeering Boruto's body.\n\nBut yes, Boruto was already Chunin level before he graduated from the academy so he's easily jounin level now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>and rasengan is like carrying a ball of chakra that needs direct application to hit.\n\nNo, that is Naruto's Rasengan. Boruto's Vanishing Rasengan is a different jutsu. It literally disappears when it's thrown and then appears right when you've already been hit by it. A far stronger opponent than Sasuke has already been hit by one and they were in a far better state than Sasuke was when he got hit.",

Why the chakra fruit planted on earth has a collosal amount of chakra?\n\nA chakra fruit fully grows into a fruit every 1000\u20132000 years so we can assume that isshiki and kaguya lived on earth for millenniums. The chakra fruit absorbs chakra from the soil that is filled with blood and deaths of living things. The chakra in the fruit rapidly increases when the planet there is filled with wars and deaths meaning that humans fought each other despite that they are fighting their own kind hence since humans on earth wage wars and filled with brutal souls, the chakra fruit then increases in terms of chakra levels. Now, Kaguya consumed the significant and special chakra fruit making her the strongest and vicious on earth but somehow other otsutsuki are claimed to be better than her well I\u2019ll try to convince you all that kaguya is the strongest otsutsuki.\n\nMost of us have seen the fight between kaguya and team 7 and they annihilated her by putting their hands on her armpit. If I said so, why am I here trying to convince you all? because most of you guys watching naruto didnt think OUTSIDE THE BOX. Now, one of the reason kaguya got annihilated was because she was careless and got unlucky. Another reason is that she just got unsealed. What do I mean by that? If we calculate the time she has been, it will definitely be damn long Approximately 6000\u20139000 years No cap. Why has being sealed for a long period of time related to any of this? I\u2019ll give you an analogy,Guns -ak-47 LMG RPG any of those destructive weapons and compared it to the future ones for sure the future guns will be more destructive as Technology develops. Thus we must thoroughly comprehend the fact that kaguya has a disadvantage(being sealed) and outdated. So if kaguya wasn\u2019t sealed, she would have develop disastrous ninjitsu that cant be absorbed and difficult to dodge. Even if so she was just unsealed after thousand of years, she would be stronger than Isshiki because she didnt use all her abilities such as using the godly strength from the ten tailed beast. Kaguya did not have the final form of the ten tailed beast as chakra from the it was extracted and divided to tailed beasts. Another reason why Kaguya did not killed Naruto and Sasuke was because she wanted to drain their chakra.\n\n\nNaruto and Sasuke were basically sharing Kaguya's power. Every being in the world had Kaguya's chakra. She wanted to extract the chakra from Sasuke and Naruto as they possessed Collosal amount if chakra.\n\n\nAnd the most Proficient sealing jutsu on their palm\n\n\nShe also needed to be careful because if they were to put their palm on Kaguya,she would be sealed for eternity again. Unlike during Isshiki fight, he did not need to worry so much that would end his career. She would have annihilated them with ease. I mean like Kaguya had many oppurturnities to destroy them but she choose not to. Another huge factor is that she was old. She hasnt changed to another new vessel and her age is ten and thousands of years old. Despite being an alien species(techinically immortal) they are still living thing so they could die. What grants them immortality is due to the fact that once they changed their vessel they reborn.\n\nHere is the abilities of Kaguya\n\nDivine powers\n-interstellar travel, hypnosis, mind-reading abilities, memory-wipe, and creation of force fields and shock waves.\n\nDojutsus and kekkei genkai\n\n-Kaguya has access to the Byakugan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder with unparalleled vision, chakra detection, and aim; the Sharingan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder to create and deflect illusions, copy techniques of other ninjas, detect chakras and traps and eventually activate the Mangekyo Sharingan; as well as the Rinnegan, a Dojutsu that provides the wielder with godly powers of summoning creatures, controlling gravity, ripping souls, reading minds, killing people, resurrecting people, opening portals, creating phantom clones, and absorbing chakra amongst others.\n\nRinne Sharingan\n\n-Allows kaguya to cast infinite tsuyokomi and potentially to wipe out chakra from others, creation of portals and especially utilizing the god tree.\n\nEighty gods vaccum Attack\n\n-Eighty God Vacuum Attack, born out of her immense control over chakra. This powerful and pervalent jutsu allows Kaguya to wield chakra in both a defensive and offensive manner. Using this technique Kaguya can materialize an immense amount of chakra and use them to form massive chakra fists.\n\nThe technique is so strong that it causes rippling shock waves and can even destroy a full-body Susanoo with relative ease. It is also capable of destroying, a complete Six Paths Chakra Body\n\nAll-killing Ash bones\n\n-An absolute devastating power that she has. The ash killing bones will be produced from her palms. This attack is very lethal as it was seen to disintegerate the person into debris.\n\nExpansive Truth-seeking orbs\n\nKaguya managed to build up collosal amount of chakra and combine them together creating this devastating jutsu. This jutsu are composed of Ying-Yang Release, as well as each of the five nature transformations, this huge ball of chaos was intended by Kaguya to be used as a means to obliterate the world into nothing, only to perish them and get vengeance.\n\nWe can assume her raw chakra by seeing how enormous is the truth-seeking orb\n\nAmenominaka\n\nAmenominaka is a power that allows Kaguya Otsutsuki to create new dimensions on the fly and teleport herself, as well as anything or anyone else along with her to that dimension.\n\nHaving complete control over the individual elements in these created dimensions will surely make her a hard oppenent to defeat. once trapped in one it is very hard to escape these dimensions and return to the real world unless someone managed to forced kaguya to bring him/her back or with the help of rift jutsu. The anime only shows six dimensions, but Kaguya can definitely create more if she desires. The disadvantage is that she could not detect the location of the person in her dimensions but she could sense their chakra so it should help her searching them.",

                    "body": "Oh boy sure thing, I'd love to see your excuses for some of these if you even bother to read them but hey, you asked for it:\n\n* Naruto's character was butchered the minute they needed to push him being a \"bad dad\" for drama and Boruto's character. Naruto, the guy who spent 700 chapters teaching us that he never goes back on his word because that is his nindo, for the first time in his entire life *goes back on his word* that he gave to his own son. He promised Boruto he would attend Himawari's birthday, and instead what does he do? He sends a clone that magically pops from being \"too tired\" all so he can do mundane, non emergency paperwork in his office for literally no fucking reason whatsoever. Naruto broke his ninja way to do mundane paperwork instead of taking an hour to attend his own daughter's fucking birthday like he promised. That is character assassination for the plot 101, Naruto Uzumaki would never do that, period.\n\n* The overwhelming inconsistency in Naruto and Sasuke's powers and abilities. They have been nerfed to hell and back since the very beginning of the series, in that they just simply *never* use even half the abilities they displayed in their final fight against one another. Naruto never again uses Six Paths Sage mode even though we *know* he can still do so because he can still fly, something he also only does I think once in the entirety of Boruto. Never bothers to use Creation of All things with his mastery of Yin and Yang release to create more insanely powerful Truth Seeking Orbs, never uses literally any of his Rasenshuriken and other elemental combinations Six Paths Sage mode grants him again (though this is also because Boruto decided to make almost every jutsu fucking useless since everyone and their mother can magically absorb chakra, but we'll get to that), and never bothers to use the other Bijuu's chakra or even call on the Toads for assistance. \n\nSasuke on the other hand has been nerfed even harder. He's always magically \"out of chakra\" to bullshit away why he can never do anything. He never again displays feats of speed and strength that compare to what he displayed in the war against Madara, Kaguya, and Naruto (something Naruto also suffers from heavily, Naruto moved faster and hit harder in the war as a 17 year old and during the canon \"The Last\" movie as a 19 year old than he did in his magical bullshit \"Baryon Mode\" Kurama pulled out of his ass for him that also magically killed Kurama even though it was established quite clearly in Shippuden that Bijuu cannot die, even if they expend all their chakra they will eventually reform no matter what). Sasuke also forgets about Kirin and worst of all, he just *never* uses all of the abilities/paths of the Rinnegan we know he posses. He never uses the Animal Path for summons, never uses the Human path to attempt to one shot remove people's souls, never uses the Asura path for the mechanical weapons, never uses the Preta path to absorb jutsu/chakra, and worst of all never bothers to use the Preta path to *literally fucking revive people*. The only path he *sometimes* uses is the Deva path, and even  then its only to throw out a couple Planetary Devastations instead of using Almighty Push/Pull even when it would be extremely useful in many of his fights. He is a complete fucking jobber and it's incredibly disrespectful to his character, though I could say the same for many old gen characters like Shino, Konohamaru, and even Sakura as well. \n\n* Handseals and training just don't fucking matter anymore. This one is somewhat more minor, and Shippuden started severely limiting the usage of hand seals as well to be fair, but in Boruto they are just literally non existent. Boruto literally just claps his fucking hands and that's good enough to use several elemental releases at the age of 12 with nothing but off screen training. Several other characters do this as well, apparently everyone is now a god of their respective elemental affinities and surpassed Hiruzen Sarutobi in elemental mastery before going through puberty. Many jutsu are also inconsitent as well, for example during the Chunin Exam arc a random kid from the Mist uses like 10 shadow clones at a time. This random genin from the Mist with no bloodline to speak of somehow magically has more chakra than all of the Kage to where he can spam clones like Naruto without breaking a sweat. Yeah sure thing dude, guess it was too hard for the writers to reread how one of the series most iconic abilities works.\n\n* Jutsu on top of being incredibly inconsistent in how they are supposed to work, might as well just be removed the fucking show at this point as well due to how many enemies can magically negate them. Every Otsutsuki can just absorb chakra and the only thing that works is punching them harder (gee a bunch of super powerful aliens where the only way to beat them is to hit them harder I wonder why people keep comparing this to DBZ). Hell we even have fucking ninja cyborgs like Delta who come out of nowhere that *also* can magically absorb jutsu and keep up with the strongest ninja to ever live. Naruto was considered so godlike he and Sasuke broke the power scaling of the original series, and now not even 20 years later magical cyborgs have somehow been created that can keep up with him in a fight? That is so beyond stupid and world breaking it might as well be shitty fanfiction.\n\n* The villages, their armies, and the Kage are now all completely and utterly useless and irrelevant. One of Naruto's greatest strengths was its unique world building that involved the great ninja wars and the politics between the villages, it's the reason Naruto overwhelming has the most fanfiction written about it over every other franchise. Being a Kage used to be a big deal, now they're all useless fodder that might as well be civilians in the face of all the alien DBZ bullshit. The series has completely lost sight of itself and while yes Kaguya came from Shippuden, that doesn't mean they needed to continue introducing bullshit overpowered aliens as new villains of the week to completely fuck up the power scaling in Boruto. \n\n* And then there's the stupidity in Naruto's actions, something that ties into both his nerfs and his character assassination. When Boruto left the village to chase after Mitsuki, a fucking *clone* of Naruto could have entered Sage Mode, tracked him in seconds, and then flew to him in minutes and instantly resolved the issue. What does he do instead? Sends a ninja team to retrieve them. Okay fair enough that's literally your son and basically niece in danger but sure send some random ninja maybe it's no big deal. Yeah guess what, they got ambushed and fucking *killed* on the way to the Land of Earth. Oh shit moment, my son is actually in mortal danger I should get off my ass and go grab him because with my abilities it would be barely an inconvenience right? Nope, send another team. Guess what, that team *also fucking dies*. Naruto now literally has blood on his hands, sending a team to their deaths over an issue he could have *instantly* resolved on his own, while the safety of his son and niece is now 100% in question and they too could easily die considering they are fresh Genin and experience Chunin and Jonin have fallen to this unknown enemy. What does he do now? Says \"I can't go to the Land of Earth it will cause a diplomatic incident!\" Excuse me, fucking what? Naruto is literally close friends and allies with every single Kage and village in the Elemental Nations. We know for a fact Kurotsuchi would have literally 0 issue with Naruto coming to save his son and help with the situation in the Rock Village, hell she would thank him, but he just *doesn't* because we need the dogshit plot to have Boruto in the spotlight and the in universe excuse doesn't even make any sense or line up with what we know about their world and the characters involved. Shit writing 101\n\nI could keep going with these if you want. Nearly every single issue arises from the writers throwing away things we learn in the original series for the sake of their D level unoriginal plot. They simultaneously nerf the older generation so they can't instantly solve everything like we know they could, but then also introduce increasingly more ridiculous and overpowered alien Otsutsuki characters to try and one up previous villains to the point that it has completely and irreparably fucked the power scaling of their world. It is no longer about ninja or villages or tactical battles or even jutsu, just bullshit alien powerups that come out of nowhere with only a tiny handful of characters even being able to remain relevant enough to do anything about it. And the irony is that the version of Naruto and Sasuke we see fight Kaguya and each other at the end of Shippuden are still stronger than all this, which is pretty telling of how busted the power scaling became at the end of Shippuden and why it was good that the series ended there to begin with.\n\nIf they wanted a sequel, they should have gone the Legend of Korra route and had it take place after Naruto and Sasuke are either dead or legitimately so old they can no longer fight at full strength. That way you don't have to disrespect and nerf older, established characters and can keep things grounded as well with reasonable threats to the newer generation that don't break the power scaling of the world.",

This is perfectly realistic and quite honestly some of the most grounded writing in all of Naruto. \n\n2. First of all, Naruto still has SPSM and he CAN still fly. Im starting to doubt that you even read or watch the series. Second, Sasuke needs all 9 Bijuu to do the Indra\u2019s arrow, if you actually watched Naruto you would know this. Naruto needs to absorb literally all the nature energy of the entire planet to use Ashura\u2019s Avatar Rasenshurikens, which wouldn\u2019t work against Jigen because they were in a different dimension with no nature energy. Isshiki would\u2019ve never let it happen so Naruto doesn\u2019t even try, he slapped and almost killed Naruto is like 2 minutes of screentime, why would Naruto be able to build up the nature energy of the entire planet in that time? The Truth Seeker orbs are never regenerated by anyone in the series, ever. Why would Naruto be able to? He also literally uses a Lava Style Rasenshuriken against Delta confirming he still has the chakra of all the other Bijuu and uses it. The toads would do literally nothing with the current power scaling in the series, don\u2019t know why you even brought them up.\n\nProve that Naruto and Sasuke are weaker than they were in the war, until you do this paragraph is completely irrelevant. Sasuke also uses Kirin against Urashiki. Yet again another claim proving that you don\u2019t even actually watch or read Boruto. Sasuke has never been shown to be able to use the paths besides the Deva path and Preta path (to an extent). Why would he magically be able to pull that shit out now?\nNone of those paths would be effective anyway because Isshiki would never let him use any of them. Soul Rip can be countered if you are stronger than your opponent which we see when Naruto is fighting Edo Nagato, he is able to resist the soul rip meaning it would be irrelevant in Boruto\n\nAre you fucking trolling with the handseals part? Boruto is SIGNIFICANTLY more grounded than late Shippuden and it\u2019s not even close. This claim actually really does make me think you haven\u2019t actually watched Boruto at all. Unbelievably stupid. Naruto literally used 1000 clones at 12 years old without Kurama by the way, what a dogshit argument. Are you trolling?\n\nJutsu negation has been a thing with almost every single enemy since the early war. If you want to complain about it in Boruto then go ahead and bitch about it in Naruto too, keep that same energy. For the Android argument. I guess Dragon Ball fucking sucks too or literally any other manga with strong artificial enemies. Yikes dude.\n\nThe Kage literally were able to restrain Kinshiki and almost kill him. Gaara and Chojuro WITHOUT THEIR WEAPONS were able to dominate Urashiki making him run away lol. Literally fucking read Boruto dude it\u2019s getting seriously pathetic at this point. \n\nThe Hokage can not personally deal with every issue that comes up. This is shown in Naruto too where Naruto constantly does Tsunades bidding.\n\nNone of these claims were hard to debunk. It really just takes a basic skim over reread to make all of these points moot. Consider doing that.",

This is perfectly realistic and quite honestly some of the most grounded writing in all of Naruto. \n\nStopped reading right here since you have apparently completely and utterly missed the entire point. It's not about just being a bad father, Naruto Uzumaki does *not go back on his word*, ever. And he did so, against his own family, to do *paperwork* . That's called character assassination for plot, there is no conceivable defense or excuse. \n\n> First of all, Naruto still has SPSM and he CAN still fly. Im starting to doubt that you even read or watch the series\n\nDid you even read what I said? I know he still has Six Paths Sage Mode, the point was that he literally *never uses it*  when he absolutely 100% should. He can create Truth Seeking Orbs literally whenever he wants, he just never does because lol plot.\n\n>  The toads would do literally nothing with the current power scaling in the series, don\u2019t know why you even brought them up.\n\nAgain your lack of reading comprehension shines through. I'm talking about all of Boruto, not just their recent fights against bullshit Otsutsuki like Ishiki and Jigen. Though thanks for reaffirming why the power scaling is completely broken and the show has literally turned into a wanna-be knock off of DBZ while abandoning everything that made ninja combat interesting to begin with.\n\n> Prove that Naruto and Sasuke are weaker than they were in the war, until you do this paragraph is completely irrelevant.\n\nNaruto dodged a literal light speed attack from Madara in the war, and Sasuke is capable of keeping up with the same speed of attacks as well. Bullshit they cannot keep up with these new Otsutsuki. And in terms of pure destructive power, go re-watch Naruto: The Last a canon movie. The power Naruto displays in his fight against Toneri and Sasuke literally one-shotting a meteor with a Chidori are levels of strength from them that are never once present in Boruto, where they should be even stronger than before (at least in Sasuke's case)\n\n> Jutsu negation has been a thing with almost every single enemy since the early war.\n\nAnd when did I ever claim that was a good thing? Late Shippuden had its issues but the excuse was that it was the literal end of the series and these crazy abilities were from the endgame villains, not something that just casually shows up every other week. The entire situation was supposed to be exceptional and not the norm for the Shinobi world and wars of the past, hence the literal 1000 year plan coming to fruition. You're literally just proving my point about lazy writing, they could have easily *improved* on this and not kept doing it, but they did so instead because fuck it.\n\n>  For the Android argument. I guess Dragon Ball fucking sucks too or literally any other manga with strong artificial enemies. \n\nNo, because Dragon Ball is Dragon Ball and Naruto is supposed to be Naruto. Again you missed the entire fucking point, Naruto becoming DBZ isn't a fucking good thing, and as I said cyborgs of that power level magically being created with 0 in universe explanation a mere less than 20 years after the 4th Great War, in a world that doesn't even have cars or jet engines, is beyond stupid.\n\n> The Kage literally were able to restrain Kinshiki and almost kill him. Gaara and Chojuro WITHOUT THEIR WEAPONS were able to dominate Urashiki making him run away lol.\n\nThey were immediately fodderized by Momoshiki and would be instantly eviscerated by Jigen and Ishiki. And those are the current power levels now, they are only going to keep going higher and the series hasn't even entered a fucking time skip yet. The pacing with the power scaling is beyond absurd and as I said, a massive detriment to the series and world building. To put this in comparison, it's like having an enemy appear in Part 1 Naruto that one shots all of the Sannin and Kage during the Chunin Exams arc and telling us that's who Naruto, who just won a fight against Kiba with a fart, is going to fight.\n\n> The Hokage can not personally deal with every issue that comes up. This is shown in Naruto too where Naruto constantly does Tsunades bidding.\n\nTsunade couldn't enter a world spanning Sage Mode for tracking instantaneously, nor could she literally make thousands of perfect copies of herself all with godlike power and speed. Naruto can, the minute that first team he sent out died it was 100% his responsibility to get the fuck off his ass and go make sure his son was safe and the issue resolved, yet he just sent another team to their deaths and continued to let his child remain in mortal danger while citing a \"political issue\" that we know for a fact does not exist in their world due to his relationship with Kurostuchi and all of the Kage. Please keep making more dogshit excuses for these ridiculous situations that are clearly only there to try and give Boruto the spotlight while throwing out all logic, lazy writers love mindless viewers/reader such as yourself.\n\nAnd of course I haven't seen literally every single episode of Boruto, I'm not sitting through 218 fucking episodes of dogshit to try and sniff out the tiny nuggets you claim are actually good. No other series gets to air for 4 years with such a horrible track record and still get called \"good\" lmao. I have kept up in passing and paid attention to all the major arcs and plot developments, and every single one has only disappointed me further. It's so bad nowadays that watching Naruto or Shippuden and then turning on an episode of Boruto makes it seem like they almost take place in completely different worlds.\n\nYou clearly have no fucking clue what made the characters or this series what they were, which doesn't surprise me considering you enjoy the mindless, lazy cash-grab sequel that is Boruto and \"the old gen getting trashed\" so I'm not even going to waste any further time with you. Enjoy your low effort dogshit, it's just non-canon fanfiction to me.",

Try fucking reading next time.\n\nAfter this latest fight though I'm done with the series and have concluded it's irredeemable trash.

Kurama's death is a plot device to permanently nerf Naruto and if I feel sad about it in any capacity it's that Kurama deserved a lot better than that.\n\nIt's just so wild to me that this is the sequel to Naruto and yet all throughout Naruto, the old gen was treated with care and respect. Meanwhile, Boruto thinks that permanently nerfing the only two reasons why the majority of people over the age of 12 give a shit about their series is a good idea. Especially when the quality of character writing from Naruto to Boruto dropped faster than Madara's meteors.",

Yet, you have these Youtube Content Creators like SwagKage and NarutoExplained telling us that we should like Boruto because its actually not trash as they initially assessed (they were right the first time). Im glad Im not the only one who sees it this way because I felt like they have disrespected the legacy that Part I and Part II has created just so that they can shove the next gen to our face and expect us to eat it up. Yes, the next gen will surpass the past generation, but how can they honestly believe that when it literally took a bunch of Dead Ninjas to be resurrected to take down One dead Ninja who has a grudge against the entire shinobi world. At least, in Part 1 and Part 2, they were able to send some of the older gen to their deaths with more respect (Like Hiruzen combating Orochimaru, edo Tensei Hashirama and Tobirama at the same time) and with much more dignity. Idk, thats always been my issue with Boruto asides the copy and paste characters and rehashed arcs.",

SwagKage said he'd try it out but he's still skeptical about it and given that Swagkage cares a lot more about Naruto than Seth does I think he'll still probably hate it. Especially because most of the initial criticisms he had only got worse.\n\nAlso ironically when people were shitting on Boruto at the beginning it was a lot more tolerable than it is now when people are praising it a lot more. I still didn't like it much but at least we would get slice-of-life moments here and there like Naruto and Sasuke spending time with the family and occasionally see the old faces pop up.\n\nBecause honestly at the end of Shippuden, what else would people want to see in the Naruto-verse? People hated the Kaguya Arc and were happy to see the peace. And now they're doing a 180 because?\n\nAnd I can't even find any silver linings. Naruto is so beloved to me because of the characters. Even when the story went to shit during the latter stages of the War it didn't bother me much because I still loved the characters. Meanwhile, in Boruto I don't really give a shit about them even the ones that are OK like Kawaki and Amado. Heck, even the characters I loved in Naruto don't feel the same. Shikamaru is now a dumbass, Sasuke got every nerf in the book thrown at him, and Naruto is forced to do whatever the plot demands him to be.",

There's so much in the Naruto-verse that can be explored and milk the franchise so to speak. There were so many unanswered questions raised during the flashbacks and I wish they would explore those more rather than trying to do Boruto. But hey, what do I know? I get that the creator and Jump wants to ride the wave while they can, but imho, this ain't the way to do it. Fine, go with the Boruto direction, but at the very least, they owe it to the fans to give us a better storyline and give the older characters the respect that they dully deserve. Anyway, Again, thank you for the clarification. I love Naruto bro. I used to think DBZ was the best Shonen Anime and I still love it, but Naruto surpassed it imo and we were treated with such great stories and character development. I hate it seeing it all thrown away for a bunch of copy pasta characters that has no substance to them.",

But because Naruto was fucking Naruto, Shonen Jump wanted a sequel series so Kishimoto's long-term assistants (Kodachi and Ikemoto) jumped on the project. Ikemoto does the drawings and Kodachi was doing the storyboard. Kishimoto was added as a supervisor but he pretty much all but said in interviews that he was done with the series.\n\nSo then Kishimoto took some time off and started a new manga, Samurai 8. Unfortunately, that got canceled in early 2020 so Kishimoto was kind of left in this weird place. \n\nThen in late 2020, Kishimoto took over the Boruto storyboard from Kodachi towards the end of the Kawaki arc (Right before Baryon Mode and the current episode). And yet when I read those chapters it really didn't feel like Kishimoto's ideas which makes sense considering he took control at the very end and was likely writing Kodachi's script. \n\nUnfortunately, I think it's too late for Kishimoto to write the series how he wants because it's been 5 years since it started and the foundations are set. I think the story and characters will improve but you can't really do much more than that so I don't really know why Kishimoto decided to come back and take control of Boruto.",

Boruto to me felt more of a fanfic than anything. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to remain optimistic and see the series course correct, but at this point the damage is far too gone imo. Im not even all that upset about Kurama or the next gen being pushed to the limelight, thats fine. Its the blatant disrespect of the old gen and I feel like Im just repeating myself. Its frustrating as a Naruto fan to see this. I decided to keep track and keep myself up to date on Boruto not because I want to, its because i cant justify my rant against it without knowing whats really going on.

So that is also not an argument.\nGedo mazo is also something Obito learnt in mere hours. So again I don't see what Nagato did so much better.

The rinnegan was hard for him to use because it want his and he has low chakra reserves compared to Nagato. But wtf do you mean he want adept with it. He used the six paths. He had 6 Jinchuuriki with him you numbskull. Gedo mazo can't one shot anyone where tf do you get that random ass assumption. And Obito summoned the entire thing during the war arc.

You said the others are just better because they're stronger and how that doesn't count but now you use the fact that Nagato literally just has more chakra than Obito by default as a testament to nagatos skill? Nagato literally only could use the 2 rinnegan was because of his immense chakra reserve he got because he's an Uzumaki. If Obito was an Uzumaki hed also be able to use 2.\n\nAlso the ability you meant is a one time thing. It literally crippled Nagato after he used it and drained all of his life force. Why would Obito cripple himself when he was only using gedo mazo as a distraction???? You must have been doing something else than watching Naruto cuz u don't know shit about it",

Don't make me laugh\n\nNagato had his rinnegan for 30 or so years and Obito for 2 days after which he already managed to use the six paths which you claimed to be the magnum opus of the rinnegan at the beginning of this ridiculous debate. He also managed to use the gedo mazo instantly in full form. \n\nAs I've said multiple times so far, Madara used multiple abilities after mere minutes of having his rinnegan and instantly surpassed Nagato in it's uses. Including perfectly using the outer path which you conveniently seem to ignore as a feat so far. \nSasuke too instantly mastered his personal rinnegan use, pull and push, shibaku tensei and most importantly a genjutsu so strong he captured ALL 9 tailed beasts at once, meanwhile pain sucks ass at genjutsu.",

If you make it way after they died then less people will come to Boruto. Naruto & Sasuke bring in easy investment but the story also suffers from Naruto & Sasuke's presence since they're supposed to be in their prime.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't have made it after they died but it would've been better if the sequel had been when they were old, past their prime and lived their lives. Like a Sasuke and Naruto in their 50-70's.\n\nAnd then it can star their grandchildren rather than their children.  \n\nSasuke and Naruto can then go out like the Third Hokage as can a lot of OGs.",

He's also in a powered up state using a power called Karma. He's just commandeering Boruto's body.\n\nBut yes, Boruto was already Chunin level before he graduated from the academy so he's easily jounin level now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>and rasengan is like carrying a ball of chakra that needs direct application to hit.\n\nNo, that is Naruto's Rasengan. Boruto's Vanishing Rasengan is a different jutsu. It literally disappears when it's thrown and then appears right when you've already been hit by it. A far stronger opponent than Sasuke has already been hit by one and they were in a far better state than Sasuke was when he got hit.",

Why the chakra fruit planted on earth has a collosal amount of chakra?\n\nA chakra fruit fully grows into a fruit every 1000\u20132000 years so we can assume that isshiki and kaguya lived on earth for millenniums. The chakra fruit absorbs chakra from the soil that is filled with blood and deaths of living things. The chakra in the fruit rapidly increases when the planet there is filled with wars and deaths meaning that humans fought each other despite that they are fighting their own kind hence since humans on earth wage wars and filled with brutal souls, the chakra fruit then increases in terms of chakra levels. Now, Kaguya consumed the significant and special chakra fruit making her the strongest and vicious on earth but somehow other otsutsuki are claimed to be better than her well I\u2019ll try to convince you all that kaguya is the strongest otsutsuki.\n\nMost of us have seen the fight between kaguya and team 7 and they annihilated her by putting their hands on her armpit. If I said so, why am I here trying to convince you all? because most of you guys watching naruto didnt think OUTSIDE THE BOX. Now, one of the reason kaguya got annihilated was because she was careless and got unlucky. Another reason is that she just got unsealed. What do I mean by that? If we calculate the time she has been, it will definitely be damn long Approximately 6000\u20139000 years No cap. Why has being sealed for a long period of time related to any of this? I\u2019ll give you an analogy,Guns -ak-47 LMG RPG any of those destructive weapons and compared it to the future ones for sure the future guns will be more destructive as Technology develops. Thus we must thoroughly comprehend the fact that kaguya has a disadvantage(being sealed) and outdated. So if kaguya wasn\u2019t sealed, she would have develop disastrous ninjitsu that cant be absorbed and difficult to dodge. Even if so she was just unsealed after thousand of years, she would be stronger than Isshiki because she didnt use all her abilities such as using the godly strength from the ten tailed beast. Kaguya did not have the final form of the ten tailed beast as chakra from the it was extracted and divided to tailed beasts. Another reason why Kaguya did not killed Naruto and Sasuke was because she wanted to drain their chakra.\n\n\nNaruto and Sasuke were basically sharing Kaguya's power. Every being in the world had Kaguya's chakra. She wanted to extract the chakra from Sasuke and Naruto as they possessed Collosal amount if chakra.\n\n\nAnd the most Proficient sealing jutsu on their palm\n\n\nShe also needed to be careful because if they were to put their palm on Kaguya,she would be sealed for eternity again. Unlike during Isshiki fight, he did not need to worry so much that would end his career. She would have annihilated them with ease. I mean like Kaguya had many oppurturnities to destroy them but she choose not to. Another huge factor is that she was old. She hasnt changed to another new vessel and her age is ten and thousands of years old. Despite being an alien species(techinically immortal) they are still living thing so they could die. What grants them immortality is due to the fact that once they changed their vessel they reborn.\n\nHere is the abilities of Kaguya\n\nDivine powers\n-interstellar travel, hypnosis, mind-reading abilities, memory-wipe, and creation of force fields and shock waves.\n\nDojutsus and kekkei genkai\n\n-Kaguya has access to the Byakugan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder with unparalleled vision, chakra detection, and aim; the Sharingan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder to create and deflect illusions, copy techniques of other ninjas, detect chakras and traps and eventually activate the Mangekyo Sharingan; as well as the Rinnegan, a Dojutsu that provides the wielder with godly powers of summoning creatures, controlling gravity, ripping souls, reading minds, killing people, resurrecting people, opening portals, creating phantom clones, and absorbing chakra amongst others.\n\nRinne Sharingan\n\n-Allows kaguya to cast infinite tsuyokomi and potentially to wipe out chakra from others, creation of portals and especially utilizing the god tree.\n\nEighty gods vaccum Attack\n\n-Eighty God Vacuum Attack, born out of her immense control over chakra. This powerful and pervalent jutsu allows Kaguya to wield chakra in both a defensive and offensive manner. Using this technique Kaguya can materialize an immense amount of chakra and use them to form massive chakra fists.\n\nThe technique is so strong that it causes rippling shock waves and can even destroy a full-body Susanoo with relative ease. It is also capable of destroying, a complete Six Paths Chakra Body\n\nAll-killing Ash bones\n\n-An absolute devastating power that she has. The ash killing bones will be produced from her palms. This attack is very lethal as it was seen to disintegerate the person into debris.\n\nExpansive Truth-seeking orbs\n\nKaguya managed to build up collosal amount of chakra and combine them together creating this devastating jutsu. This jutsu are composed of Ying-Yang Release, as well as each of the five nature transformations, this huge ball of chaos was intended by Kaguya to be used as a means to obliterate the world into nothing, only to perish them and get vengeance.\n\nWe can assume her raw chakra by seeing how enormous is the truth-seeking orb\n\nAmenominaka\n\nAmenominaka is a power that allows Kaguya Otsutsuki to create new dimensions on the fly and teleport herself, as well as anything or anyone else along with her to that dimension.\n\nHaving complete control over the individual elements in these created dimensions will surely make her a hard oppenent to defeat. once trapped in one it is very hard to escape these dimensions and return to the real world unless someone managed to forced kaguya to bring him/her back or with the help of rift jutsu. The anime only shows six dimensions, but Kaguya can definitely create more if she desires. The disadvantage is that she could not detect the location of the person in her dimensions but she could sense their chakra so it should help her searching them.",

            "body": "Oh boy sure thing, I'd love to see your excuses for some of these if you even bother to read them but hey, you asked for it:\n\n* Naruto's character was butchered the minute they needed to push him being a \"bad dad\" for drama and Boruto's character. Naruto, the guy who spent 700 chapters teaching us that he never goes back on his word because that is his nindo, for the first time in his entire life *goes back on his word* that he gave to his own son. He promised Boruto he would attend Himawari's birthday, and instead what does he do? He sends a clone that magically pops from being \"too tired\" all so he can do mundane, non emergency paperwork in his office for literally no fucking reason whatsoever. Naruto broke his ninja way to do mundane paperwork instead of taking an hour to attend his own daughter's fucking birthday like he promised. That is character assassination for the plot 101, Naruto Uzumaki would never do that, period.\n\n* The overwhelming inconsistency in Naruto and Sasuke's powers and abilities. They have been nerfed to hell and back since the very beginning of the series, in that they just simply *never* use even half the abilities they displayed in their final fight against one another. Naruto never again uses Six Paths Sage mode even though we *know* he can still do so because he can still fly, something he also only does I think once in the entirety of Boruto. Never bothers to use Creation of All things with his mastery of Yin and Yang release to create more insanely powerful Truth Seeking Orbs, never uses literally any of his Rasenshuriken and other elemental combinations Six Paths Sage mode grants him again (though this is also because Boruto decided to make almost every jutsu fucking useless since everyone and their mother can magically absorb chakra, but we'll get to that), and never bothers to use the other Bijuu's chakra or even call on the Toads for assistance. \n\nSasuke on the other hand has been nerfed even harder. He's always magically \"out of chakra\" to bullshit away why he can never do anything. He never again displays feats of speed and strength that compare to what he displayed in the war against Madara, Kaguya, and Naruto (something Naruto also suffers from heavily, Naruto moved faster and hit harder in the war as a 17 year old and during the canon \"The Last\" movie as a 19 year old than he did in his magical bullshit \"Baryon Mode\" Kurama pulled out of his ass for him that also magically killed Kurama even though it was established quite clearly in Shippuden that Bijuu cannot die, even if they expend all their chakra they will eventually reform no matter what). Sasuke also forgets about Kirin and worst of all, he just *never* uses all of the abilities/paths of the Rinnegan we know he posses. He never uses the Animal Path for summons, never uses the Human path to attempt to one shot remove people's souls, never uses the Asura path for the mechanical weapons, never uses the Preta path to absorb jutsu/chakra, and worst of all never bothers to use the Preta path to *literally fucking revive people*. The only path he *sometimes* uses is the Deva path, and even  then its only to throw out a couple Planetary Devastations instead of using Almighty Push/Pull even when it would be extremely useful in many of his fights. He is a complete fucking jobber and it's incredibly disrespectful to his character, though I could say the same for many old gen characters like Shino, Konohamaru, and even Sakura as well. \n\n* Handseals and training just don't fucking matter anymore. This one is somewhat more minor, and Shippuden started severely limiting the usage of hand seals as well to be fair, but in Boruto they are just literally non existent. Boruto literally just claps his fucking hands and that's good enough to use several elemental releases at the age of 12 with nothing but off screen training. Several other characters do this as well, apparently everyone is now a god of their respective elemental affinities and surpassed Hiruzen Sarutobi in elemental mastery before going through puberty. Many jutsu are also inconsitent as well, for example during the Chunin Exam arc a random kid from the Mist uses like 10 shadow clones at a time. This random genin from the Mist with no bloodline to speak of somehow magically has more chakra than all of the Kage to where he can spam clones like Naruto without breaking a sweat. Yeah sure thing dude, guess it was too hard for the writers to reread how one of the series most iconic abilities works.\n\n* Jutsu on top of being incredibly inconsistent in how they are supposed to work, might as well just be removed the fucking show at this point as well due to how many enemies can magically negate them. Every Otsutsuki can just absorb chakra and the only thing that works is punching them harder (gee a bunch of super powerful aliens where the only way to beat them is to hit them harder I wonder why people keep comparing this to DBZ). Hell we even have fucking ninja cyborgs like Delta who come out of nowhere that *also* can magically absorb jutsu and keep up with the strongest ninja to ever live. Naruto was considered so godlike he and Sasuke broke the power scaling of the original series, and now not even 20 years later magical cyborgs have somehow been created that can keep up with him in a fight? That is so beyond stupid and world breaking it might as well be shitty fanfiction.\n\n* The villages, their armies, and the Kage are now all completely and utterly useless and irrelevant. One of Naruto's greatest strengths was its unique world building that involved the great ninja wars and the politics between the villages, it's the reason Naruto overwhelming has the most fanfiction written about it over every other franchise. Being a Kage used to be a big deal, now they're all useless fodder that might as well be civilians in the face of all the alien DBZ bullshit. The series has completely lost sight of itself and while yes Kaguya came from Shippuden, that doesn't mean they needed to continue introducing bullshit overpowered aliens as new villains of the week to completely fuck up the power scaling in Boruto. \n\n* And then there's the stupidity in Naruto's actions, something that ties into both his nerfs and his character assassination. When Boruto left the village to chase after Mitsuki, a fucking *clone* of Naruto could have entered Sage Mode, tracked him in seconds, and then flew to him in minutes and instantly resolved the issue. What does he do instead? Sends a ninja team to retrieve them. Okay fair enough that's literally your son and basically niece in danger but sure send some random ninja maybe it's no big deal. Yeah guess what, they got ambushed and fucking *killed* on the way to the Land of Earth. Oh shit moment, my son is actually in mortal danger I should get off my ass and go grab him because with my abilities it would be barely an inconvenience right? Nope, send another team. Guess what, that team *also fucking dies*. Naruto now literally has blood on his hands, sending a team to their deaths over an issue he could have *instantly* resolved on his own, while the safety of his son and niece is now 100% in question and they too could easily die considering they are fresh Genin and experience Chunin and Jonin have fallen to this unknown enemy. What does he do now? Says \"I can't go to the Land of Earth it will cause a diplomatic incident!\" Excuse me, fucking what? Naruto is literally close friends and allies with every single Kage and village in the Elemental Nations. We know for a fact Kurotsuchi would have literally 0 issue with Naruto coming to save his son and help with the situation in the Rock Village, hell she would thank him, but he just *doesn't* because we need the dogshit plot to have Boruto in the spotlight and the in universe excuse doesn't even make any sense or line up with what we know about their world and the characters involved. Shit writing 101\n\nI could keep going with these if you want. Nearly every single issue arises from the writers throwing away things we learn in the original series for the sake of their D level unoriginal plot. They simultaneously nerf the older generation so they can't instantly solve everything like we know they could, but then also introduce increasingly more ridiculous and overpowered alien Otsutsuki characters to try and one up previous villains to the point that it has completely and irreparably fucked the power scaling of their world. It is no longer about ninja or villages or tactical battles or even jutsu, just bullshit alien powerups that come out of nowhere with only a tiny handful of characters even being able to remain relevant enough to do anything about it. And the irony is that the version of Naruto and Sasuke we see fight Kaguya and each other at the end of Shippuden are still stronger than all this, which is pretty telling of how busted the power scaling became at the end of Shippuden and why it was good that the series ended there to begin with.\n\nIf they wanted a sequel, they should have gone the Legend of Korra route and had it take place after Naruto and Sasuke are either dead or legitimately so old they can no longer fight at full strength. That way you don't have to disrespect and nerf older, established characters and can keep things grounded as well with reasonable threats to the newer generation that don't break the power scaling of the world.",

This is perfectly realistic and quite honestly some of the most grounded writing in all of Naruto. \n\n2. First of all, Naruto still has SPSM and he CAN still fly. Im starting to doubt that you even read or watch the series. Second, Sasuke needs all 9 Bijuu to do the Indra\u2019s arrow, if you actually watched Naruto you would know this. Naruto needs to absorb literally all the nature energy of the entire planet to use Ashura\u2019s Avatar Rasenshurikens, which wouldn\u2019t work against Jigen because they were in a different dimension with no nature energy. Isshiki would\u2019ve never let it happen so Naruto doesn\u2019t even try, he slapped and almost killed Naruto is like 2 minutes of screentime, why would Naruto be able to build up the nature energy of the entire planet in that time? The Truth Seeker orbs are never regenerated by anyone in the series, ever. Why would Naruto be able to? He also literally uses a Lava Style Rasenshuriken against Delta confirming he still has the chakra of all the other Bijuu and uses it. The toads would do literally nothing with the current power scaling in the series, don\u2019t know why you even brought them up.\n\nProve that Naruto and Sasuke are weaker than they were in the war, until you do this paragraph is completely irrelevant. Sasuke also uses Kirin against Urashiki. Yet again another claim proving that you don\u2019t even actually watch or read Boruto. Sasuke has never been shown to be able to use the paths besides the Deva path and Preta path (to an extent). Why would he magically be able to pull that shit out now?\nNone of those paths would be effective anyway because Isshiki would never let him use any of them. Soul Rip can be countered if you are stronger than your opponent which we see when Naruto is fighting Edo Nagato, he is able to resist the soul rip meaning it would be irrelevant in Boruto\n\nAre you fucking trolling with the handseals part? Boruto is SIGNIFICANTLY more grounded than late Shippuden and it\u2019s not even close. This claim actually really does make me think you haven\u2019t actually watched Boruto at all. Unbelievably stupid. Naruto literally used 1000 clones at 12 years old without Kurama by the way, what a dogshit argument. Are you trolling?\n\nJutsu negation has been a thing with almost every single enemy since the early war. If you want to complain about it in Boruto then go ahead and bitch about it in Naruto too, keep that same energy. For the Android argument. I guess Dragon Ball fucking sucks too or literally any other manga with strong artificial enemies. Yikes dude.\n\nThe Kage literally were able to restrain Kinshiki and almost kill him. Gaara and Chojuro WITHOUT THEIR WEAPONS were able to dominate Urashiki making him run away lol. Literally fucking read Boruto dude it\u2019s getting seriously pathetic at this point. \n\nThe Hokage can not personally deal with every issue that comes up. This is shown in Naruto too where Naruto constantly does Tsunades bidding.\n\nNone of these claims were hard to debunk. It really just takes a basic skim over reread to make all of these points moot. Consider doing that.",

This is perfectly realistic and quite honestly some of the most grounded writing in all of Naruto. \n\nStopped reading right here since you have apparently completely and utterly missed the entire point. It's not about just being a bad father, Naruto Uzumaki does *not go back on his word*, ever. And he did so, against his own family, to do *paperwork* . That's called character assassination for plot, there is no conceivable defense or excuse. \n\n> First of all, Naruto still has SPSM and he CAN still fly. Im starting to doubt that you even read or watch the series\n\nDid you even read what I said? I know he still has Six Paths Sage Mode, the point was that he literally *never uses it*  when he absolutely 100% should. He can create Truth Seeking Orbs literally whenever he wants, he just never does because lol plot.\n\n>  The toads would do literally nothing with the current power scaling in the series, don\u2019t know why you even brought them up.\n\nAgain your lack of reading comprehension shines through. I'm talking about all of Boruto, not just their recent fights against bullshit Otsutsuki like Ishiki and Jigen. Though thanks for reaffirming why the power scaling is completely broken and the show has literally turned into a wanna-be knock off of DBZ while abandoning everything that made ninja combat interesting to begin with.\n\n> Prove that Naruto and Sasuke are weaker than they were in the war, until you do this paragraph is completely irrelevant.\n\nNaruto dodged a literal light speed attack from Madara in the war, and Sasuke is capable of keeping up with the same speed of attacks as well. Bullshit they cannot keep up with these new Otsutsuki. And in terms of pure destructive power, go re-watch Naruto: The Last a canon movie. The power Naruto displays in his fight against Toneri and Sasuke literally one-shotting a meteor with a Chidori are levels of strength from them that are never once present in Boruto, where they should be even stronger than before (at least in Sasuke's case)\n\n> Jutsu negation has been a thing with almost every single enemy since the early war.\n\nAnd when did I ever claim that was a good thing? Late Shippuden had its issues but the excuse was that it was the literal end of the series and these crazy abilities were from the endgame villains, not something that just casually shows up every other week. The entire situation was supposed to be exceptional and not the norm for the Shinobi world and wars of the past, hence the literal 1000 year plan coming to fruition. You're literally just proving my point about lazy writing, they could have easily *improved* on this and not kept doing it, but they did so instead because fuck it.\n\n>  For the Android argument. I guess Dragon Ball fucking sucks too or literally any other manga with strong artificial enemies. \n\nNo, because Dragon Ball is Dragon Ball and Naruto is supposed to be Naruto. Again you missed the entire fucking point, Naruto becoming DBZ isn't a fucking good thing, and as I said cyborgs of that power level magically being created with 0 in universe explanation a mere less than 20 years after the 4th Great War, in a world that doesn't even have cars or jet engines, is beyond stupid.\n\n> The Kage literally were able to restrain Kinshiki and almost kill him. Gaara and Chojuro WITHOUT THEIR WEAPONS were able to dominate Urashiki making him run away lol.\n\nThey were immediately fodderized by Momoshiki and would be instantly eviscerated by Jigen and Ishiki. And those are the current power levels now, they are only going to keep going higher and the series hasn't even entered a fucking time skip yet. The pacing with the power scaling is beyond absurd and as I said, a massive detriment to the series and world building. To put this in comparison, it's like having an enemy appear in Part 1 Naruto that one shots all of the Sannin and Kage during the Chunin Exams arc and telling us that's who Naruto, who just won a fight against Kiba with a fart, is going to fight.\n\n> The Hokage can not personally deal with every issue that comes up. This is shown in Naruto too where Naruto constantly does Tsunades bidding.\n\nTsunade couldn't enter a world spanning Sage Mode for tracking instantaneously, nor could she literally make thousands of perfect copies of herself all with godlike power and speed. Naruto can, the minute that first team he sent out died it was 100% his responsibility to get the fuck off his ass and go make sure his son was safe and the issue resolved, yet he just sent another team to their deaths and continued to let his child remain in mortal danger while citing a \"political issue\" that we know for a fact does not exist in their world due to his relationship with Kurostuchi and all of the Kage. Please keep making more dogshit excuses for these ridiculous situations that are clearly only there to try and give Boruto the spotlight while throwing out all logic, lazy writers love mindless viewers/reader such as yourself.\n\nAnd of course I haven't seen literally every single episode of Boruto, I'm not sitting through 218 fucking episodes of dogshit to try and sniff out the tiny nuggets you claim are actually good. No other series gets to air for 4 years with such a horrible track record and still get called \"good\" lmao. I have kept up in passing and paid attention to all the major arcs and plot developments, and every single one has only disappointed me further. It's so bad nowadays that watching Naruto or Shippuden and then turning on an episode of Boruto makes it seem like they almost take place in completely different worlds.\n\nYou clearly have no fucking clue what made the characters or this series what they were, which doesn't surprise me considering you enjoy the mindless, lazy cash-grab sequel that is Boruto and \"the old gen getting trashed\" so I'm not even going to waste any further time with you. Enjoy your low effort dogshit, it's just non-canon fanfiction to me.",

Try fucking reading next time.\n\nAfter this latest fight though I'm done with the series and have concluded it's irredeemable trash. If you can't impress me after 218 episodes and 4 fucking years of runtime then it's just not happening lmao, no other series gets away with being shit for that long and still gets a chance to be called \"good\"\n\nThe fact that that's the weak ass response you can give me other than \"it took you a long time to write that lol!\" (it took like 6 minutes) is proof enough you can't actually \"debunk\" what I've said and know jack shit about what made Naruto and its characters the series it was, and just how badly Boruto has shit on all of it.\n\nKeep enjoying the garbage though, hack writers love when mindless people like you eat it all up just like people who enjoyed shit like Game of Thrones season 8 or Attack on Titan's ending.",

Kurama's death is a plot device to permanently nerf Naruto and if I feel sad about it in any capacity it's that Kurama deserved a lot better than that.\n\nIt's just so wild to me that this is the sequel to Naruto and yet all throughout Naruto, the old gen was treated with care and respect. Meanwhile, Boruto thinks that permanently nerfing the only two reasons why the majority of people over the age of 12 give a shit about their series is a good idea. Especially when the quality of character writing from Naruto to Boruto dropped faster than Madara's meteors.",

I still didn't like it much but at least we would get slice-of-life moments here and there like Naruto and Sasuke spending time with the family and occasionally see the old faces pop up.\n\nBecause honestly at the end of Shippuden, what else would people want to see in the Naruto-verse? People hated the Kaguya Arc and were happy to see the peace. And now they're doing a 180 because?\n\nAnd I can't even find any silver linings. Naruto is so beloved to me because of the characters. Even when the story went to shit during the latter stages of the War it didn't bother me much because I still loved the characters. Meanwhile, in Boruto I don't really give a shit about them even the ones that are OK like Kawaki and Amado. Heck, even the characters I loved in Naruto don't feel the same.

I get that the creator and Jump wants to ride the wave while they can, but imho, this ain't the way to do it. Fine, go with the Boruto direction, but at the very least, they owe it to the fans to give us a better storyline and give the older characters the respect that they dully deserve. Anyway, Again, thank you for the clarification. I love Naruto bro. I used to think DBZ was the best Shonen Anime and I still love it, but Naruto surpassed it imo and we were treated with such great stories and character development.

But because Naruto was fucking Naruto, Shonen Jump wanted a sequel series so Kishimoto's long-term assistants (Kodachi and Ikemoto) jumped on the project. Ikemoto does the drawings and Kodachi was doing the storyboard. Kishimoto was added as a supervisor but he pretty much all but said in interviews that he was done with the series.\n\nSo then Kishimoto took some time off and started a new manga, Samurai 8. Unfortunately, that got canceled in early 2020 so Kishimoto was kind of left in this weird place. \n\nThen in late 2020, Kishimoto took over the Boruto storyboard from Kodachi towards the end of the Kawaki arc (Right before Baryon Mode and the current episode). And yet when I read those chapters it really didn't feel like Kishimoto's ideas which makes sense considering he took control at the very end and was likely writing Kodachi's script. \n\nUnfortunately, I think it's too late for Kishimoto to write the series how he wants because it's been 5 years since it started and the foundations are set. I think the story and characters will improve but you can't really do much more than that so I don't really know why Kishimoto decided to come back and take control of Boruto.",

Shippuden ended very conclusively and there was no need to force a direct sequel.\n\nThat's probably why my favorite episodes in Boruto are the ones where it's the adults just hanging out with their kids. If you're going to make a direct sequel make it a slice of life series which revolves around the kids interacting with their parents.\n\nAnd if you wanted a sequel to Naruto with science and aliens you do what TLOK did and set it far into the future where Naruto is dead.",

So that is also not an argument.\nGedo mazo is also something Obito learnt in mere hours. So again I don't see what Nagato did so much better.

Remember the same Nagato whose cock your gargling rn, needed help of 9 other Akatsuki over the time of 3 days to do that same thing for every tailed beast. Don't make me laugh\n\nNagato had his rinnegan for 30 or so years and Obito for 2 days after which he already managed to use the six paths which you claimed to be the magnum opus of the rinnegan at the beginning of this ridiculous debate. He also managed to use the gedo mazo instantly in full form. \n\nAs I've said multiple times so far, Madara used multiple abilities after mere minutes of having his rinnegan and instantly surpassed Nagato in it's uses. Including perfectly using the outer path which you conveniently seem to ignore as a feat so far. \nSasuke too instantly mastered his personal rinnegan use, pull and push, shibaku tensei and most importantly a genjutsu so strong he captured ALL 9 tailed beasts at once, meanwhile pain sucks ass at genjutsu.",

If Nagato is so good, how come he only found out how to use the abilities as a late teen? Obito learnt multiple in a day. That's far more impressive.\n\n> Of course he's not that great at it he wasn't born into the clan of asspulls\n\nThis is the funniest part.\n\nHow did it go from \"Nagato is the best Rinnegan user\" to \"of course he's not that great..\" \n\nI consider this debate a victory.

Nerfing the shit out of them is making Naruto fans shit on it, killing them will make them shit on it, what's the difference?\n\nPros and cons. If you make it way after they died then less people will come to Boruto. Naruto & Sasuke bring in easy investment but the story also suffers from Naruto & Sasuke's presence since they're supposed to be in their prime.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't have made it after they died but it would've been better if the sequel had been when they were old, past their prime and lived their lives. Like a Sasuke and Naruto in their 50-70's.\n\nAnd then it can star their grandchildren rather than their children.  \n\nSasuke and Naruto can then go out like the Third Hokage as can a lot of OGs.",

He's also in a powered up state using a power called Karma. He's just commandeering Boruto's body.\n\nBut yes, Boruto was already Chunin level before he graduated from the academy so he's easily jounin level now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>and rasengan is like carrying a ball of chakra that needs direct application to hit.\n\nNo, that is Naruto's Rasengan. Boruto's Vanishing Rasengan is a different jutsu. It literally disappears when it's thrown and then appears right when you've already been hit by it. A far stronger opponent than Sasuke has already been hit by one and they were in a far better state than Sasuke was when he got hit.",

They had better strategies in the land of waves arc in pt1 than in that fight. \n\nIts The writers way of trying desperately to get rid of characters to make way for new ones, which in theory makes sense, but the execution is terrible and disrespectful towards people who grew up with these characters.",

Why the chakra fruit planted on earth has a collosal amount of chakra?\n\nA chakra fruit fully grows into a fruit every 1000\u20132000 years so we can assume that isshiki and kaguya lived on earth for millenniums. The chakra fruit absorbs chakra from the soil that is filled with blood and deaths of living things. The chakra in the fruit rapidly increases when the planet there is filled with wars and deaths meaning that humans fought each other despite that they are fighting their own kind hence since humans on earth wage wars and filled with brutal souls, the chakra fruit then increases in terms of chakra levels. Now, Kaguya consumed the significant and special chakra fruit making her the strongest and vicious on earth but somehow other otsutsuki are claimed to be better than her well I\u2019ll try to convince you all that kaguya is the strongest otsutsuki.\n\nMost of us have seen the fight between kaguya and team 7 and they annihilated her by putting their hands on her armpit. If I said so, why am I here trying to convince you all? because most of you guys watching naruto didnt think OUTSIDE THE BOX. Now, one of the reason kaguya got annihilated was because she was careless and got unlucky. Another reason is that she just got unsealed. What do I mean by that? If we calculate the time she has been, it will definitely be damn long Approximately 6000\u20139000 years No cap. Why has being sealed for a long period of time related to any of this? I\u2019ll give you an analogy,Guns -ak-47 LMG RPG any of those destructive weapons and compared it to the future ones for sure the future guns will be more destructive as Technology develops. Thus we must thoroughly comprehend the fact that kaguya has a disadvantage(being sealed) and outdated. So if kaguya wasn\u2019t sealed, she would have develop disastrous ninjitsu that cant be absorbed and difficult to dodge. Even if so she was just unsealed after thousand of years, she would be stronger than Isshiki because she didnt use all her abilities such as using the godly strength from the ten tailed beast. Kaguya did not have the final form of the ten tailed beast as chakra from the it was extracted and divided to tailed beasts. Another reason why Kaguya did not killed Naruto and Sasuke was because she wanted to drain their chakra.\n\n\nNaruto and Sasuke were basically sharing Kaguya's power. Every being in the world had Kaguya's chakra. She wanted to extract the chakra from Sasuke and Naruto as they possessed Collosal amount if chakra.\n\n\nAnd the most Proficient sealing jutsu on their palm\n\n\nShe also needed to be careful because if they were to put their palm on Kaguya,she would be sealed for eternity again. Unlike during Isshiki fight, he did not need to worry so much that would end his career. She would have annihilated them with ease. I mean like Kaguya had many oppurturnities to destroy them but she choose not to. Another huge factor is that she was old. She hasnt changed to another new vessel and her age is ten and thousands of years old. Despite being an alien species(techinically immortal) they are still living thing so they could die. What grants them immortality is due to the fact that once they changed their vessel they reborn.\n\nHere is the abilities of Kaguya\n\nDivine powers\n-interstellar travel, hypnosis, mind-reading abilities, memory-wipe, and creation of force fields and shock waves.\n\nDojutsus and kekkei genkai\n\n-Kaguya has access to the Byakugan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder with unparalleled vision, chakra detection, and aim; the Sharingan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder to create and deflect illusions, copy techniques of other ninjas, detect chakras and traps and eventually activate the Mangekyo Sharingan; as well as the Rinnegan, a Dojutsu that provides the wielder with godly powers of summoning creatures, controlling gravity, ripping souls, reading minds, killing people, resurrecting people, opening portals, creating phantom clones, and absorbing chakra amongst others.\n\nRinne Sharingan\n\n-Allows kaguya to cast infinite tsuyokomi and potentially to wipe out chakra from others, creation of portals and especially utilizing the god tree.\n\nEighty gods vaccum Attack\n\n-Eighty God Vacuum Attack, born out of her immense control over chakra. This powerful and pervalent jutsu allows Kaguya to wield chakra in both a defensive and offensive manner. Using this technique Kaguya can materialize an immense amount of chakra and use them to form massive chakra fists.\n\nThe technique is so strong that it causes rippling shock waves and can even destroy a full-body Susanoo with relative ease. It is also capable of destroying, a complete Six Paths Chakra Body\n\nAll-killing Ash bones\n\n-An absolute devastating power that she has. The ash killing bones will be produced from her palms. This attack is very lethal as it was seen to disintegerate the person into debris.\n\nExpansive Truth-seeking orbs\n\nKaguya managed to build up collosal amount of chakra and combine them together creating this devastating jutsu. This jutsu are composed of Ying-Yang Release, as well as each of the five nature transformations, this huge ball of chaos was intended by Kaguya to be used as a means to obliterate the world into nothing, only to perish them and get vengeance.\n\nWe can assume her raw chakra by seeing how enormous is the truth-seeking orb\n\nAmenominaka\n\nAmenominaka is a power that allows Kaguya Otsutsuki to create new dimensions on the fly and teleport herself, as well as anything or anyone else along with her to that dimension.\n\nHaving complete control over the individual elements in these created dimensions will surely make her a hard oppenent to defeat. once trapped in one it is very hard to escape these dimensions and return to the real world unless someone managed to forced kaguya to bring him/her back or with the help of rift jutsu. The anime only shows six dimensions, but Kaguya can definitely create more if she desires. The disadvantage is that she could not detect the location of the person in her dimensions but she could sense their chakra so it should help her searching them.",

            "body": "1. All this is is you bitching that an orphaned child with no father figure doesn\u2019t know how to be a great father himself. This is perfectly realistic and quite honestly some of the most grounded writing in all of Naruto. \n\n2. First of all, Naruto still has SPSM and he CAN still fly. Im starting to doubt that you even read or watch the series. Second, Sasuke needs all 9 Bijuu to do the Indra\u2019s arrow, if you actually watched Naruto you would know this. Naruto needs to absorb literally all the nature energy of the entire planet to use Ashura\u2019s Avatar Rasenshurikens, which wouldn\u2019t work against Jigen because they were in a different dimension with no nature energy. Isshiki would\u2019ve never let it happen so Naruto doesn\u2019t even try, he slapped and almost killed Naruto is like 2 minutes of screentime, why would Naruto be able to build up the nature energy of the entire planet in that time? The Truth Seeker orbs are never regenerated by anyone in the series, ever. Why would Naruto be able to? He also literally uses a Lava Style Rasenshuriken against Delta confirming he still has the chakra of all the other Bijuu and uses it. The toads would do literally nothing with the current power scaling in the series, don\u2019t know why you even brought them up.\n\nProve that Naruto and Sasuke are weaker than they were in the war, until you do this paragraph is completely irrelevant. Sasuke also uses Kirin against Urashiki. Yet again another claim proving that you don\u2019t even actually watch or read Boruto. Sasuke has never been shown to be able to use the paths besides the Deva path and Preta path (to an extent). Why would he magically be able to pull that shit out now?\nNone of those paths would be effective anyway because Isshiki would never let him use any of them. Soul Rip can be countered if you are stronger than your opponent which we see when Naruto is fighting Edo Nagato, he is able to resist the soul rip meaning it would be irrelevant in Boruto\n\nAre you fucking trolling with the handseals part? Boruto is SIGNIFICANTLY more grounded than late Shippuden and it\u2019s not even close. This claim actually really does make me think you haven\u2019t actually watched Boruto at all. Unbelievably stupid. Naruto literally used 1000 clones at 12 years old without Kurama by the way, what a dogshit argument. Are you trolling?\n\nJutsu negation has been a thing with almost every single enemy since the early war. If you want to complain about it in Boruto then go ahead and bitch about it in Naruto too, keep that same energy. For the Android argument. I guess Dragon Ball fucking sucks too or literally any other manga with strong artificial enemies. Yikes dude.\n\nThe Kage literally were able to restrain Kinshiki and almost kill him. Gaara and Chojuro WITHOUT THEIR WEAPONS were able to dominate Urashiki making him run away lol. Literally fucking read Boruto dude it\u2019s getting seriously pathetic at this point. \n\nThe Hokage can not personally deal with every issue that comes up. This is shown in Naruto too where Naruto constantly does Tsunades bidding.\n\nNone of these claims were hard to debunk. It really just takes a basic skim over reread to make all of these points moot. Consider doing that.",

                    "body": "> All this is is you bitching that an orphaned child with no father figure doesn\u2019t know how to be a great father himself. This is perfectly realistic and quite honestly some of the most grounded writing in all of Naruto. \n\nStopped reading right here since you have apparently completely and utterly missed the entire point. It's not about just being a bad father, Naruto Uzumaki does *not go back on his word*, ever. And he did so, against his own family, to do *paperwork* . That's called character assassination for plot, there is no conceivable defense or excuse. \n\n> First of all, Naruto still has SPSM and he CAN still fly. Im starting to doubt that you even read or watch the series\n\nDid you even read what I said? I know he still has Six Paths Sage Mode, the point was that he literally *never uses it*  when he absolutely 100% should. He can create Truth Seeking Orbs literally whenever he wants, he just never does because lol plot.\n\n>  The toads would do literally nothing with the current power scaling in the series, don\u2019t know why you even brought them up.\n\nAgain your lack of reading comprehension shines through. I'm talking about all of Boruto, not just their recent fights against bullshit Otsutsuki like Ishiki and Jigen. Though thanks for reaffirming why the power scaling is completely broken and the show has literally turned into a wanna-be knock off of DBZ while abandoning everything that made ninja combat interesting to begin with.\n\n> Prove that Naruto and Sasuke are weaker than they were in the war, until you do this paragraph is completely irrelevant.\n\nNaruto dodged a literal light speed attack from Madara in the war, and Sasuke is capable of keeping up with the same speed of attacks as well. Bullshit they cannot keep up with these new Otsutsuki. And in terms of pure destructive power, go re-watch Naruto: The Last a canon movie. The power Naruto displays in his fight against Toneri and Sasuke literally one-shotting a meteor with a Chidori are levels of strength from them that are never once present in Boruto, where they should be even stronger than before (at least in Sasuke's case)\n\n> Jutsu negation has been a thing with almost every single enemy since the early war.\n\nAnd when did I ever claim that was a good thing? Late Shippuden had its issues but the excuse was that it was the literal end of the series and these crazy abilities were from the endgame villains, not something that just casually shows up every other week. The entire situation was supposed to be exceptional and not the norm for the Shinobi world and wars of the past, hence the literal 1000 year plan coming to fruition. You're literally just proving my point about lazy writing, they could have easily *improved* on this and not kept doing it, but they did so instead because fuck it.\n\n>  For the Android argument. I guess Dragon Ball fucking sucks too or literally any other manga with strong artificial enemies. \n\nNo, because Dragon Ball is Dragon Ball and Naruto is supposed to be Naruto. Again you missed the entire fucking point, Naruto becoming DBZ isn't a fucking good thing, and as I said cyborgs of that power level magically being created with 0 in universe explanation a mere less than 20 years after the 4th Great War, in a world that doesn't even have cars or jet engines, is beyond stupid.\n\n> The Kage literally were able to restrain Kinshiki and almost kill him. Gaara and Chojuro WITHOUT THEIR WEAPONS were able to dominate Urashiki making him run away lol.\n\nThey were immediately fodderized by Momoshiki and would be instantly eviscerated by Jigen and Ishiki. And those are the current power levels now, they are only going to keep going higher and the series hasn't even entered a fucking time skip yet. The pacing with the power scaling is beyond absurd and as I said, a massive detriment to the series and world building. To put this in comparison, it's like having an enemy appear in Part 1 Naruto that one shots all of the Sannin and Kage during the Chunin Exams arc and telling us that's who Naruto, who just won a fight against Kiba with a fart, is going to fight.\n\n> The Hokage can not personally deal with every issue that comes up. This is shown in Naruto too where Naruto constantly does Tsunades bidding.\n\nTsunade couldn't enter a world spanning Sage Mode for tracking instantaneously, nor could she literally make thousands of perfect copies of herself all with godlike power and speed. Naruto can, the minute that first team he sent out died it was 100% his responsibility to get the fuck off his ass and go make sure his son was safe and the issue resolved, yet he just sent another team to their deaths and continued to let his child remain in mortal danger while citing a \"political issue\" that we know for a fact does not exist in their world due to his relationship with Kurostuchi and all of the Kage. Please keep making more dogshit excuses for these ridiculous situations that are clearly only there to try and give Boruto the spotlight while throwing out all logic, lazy writers love mindless viewers/reader such as yourself.\n\nAnd of course I haven't seen literally every single episode of Boruto, I'm not sitting through 218 fucking episodes of dogshit to try and sniff out the tiny nuggets you claim are actually good. No other series gets to air for 4 years with such a horrible track record and still get called \"good\" lmao. I have kept up in passing and paid attention to all the major arcs and plot developments, and every single one has only disappointed me further. It's so bad nowadays that watching Naruto or Shippuden and then turning on an episode of Boruto makes it seem like they almost take place in completely different worlds.\n\nYou clearly have no fucking clue what made the characters or this series what they were, which doesn't surprise me considering you enjoy the mindless, lazy cash-grab sequel that is Boruto and \"the old gen getting trashed\" so I'm not even going to waste any further time with you. Enjoy your low effort dogshit, it's just non-canon fanfiction to me.",

Try fucking reading next time.\n\nAfter this latest fight though I'm done with the series and have concluded it's irredeemable trash. If you can't impress me after 218 episodes and 4 fucking years of runtime then it's just not happening lmao, no other series gets away with being shit for that long and still gets a chance to be called \"good\"\n\nThe fact that that's the weak ass response you can give me other than \"it took you a long time to write that lol!\" (it took like 6 minutes) is proof enough you can't actually \"debunk\" what I've said and know jack shit about what made Naruto and its characters the series it was, and just how badly Boruto has shit on all of it.\n\nKeep enjoying the garbage though, hack writers love when mindless people like you eat it all up just like people who enjoyed shit like Game of Thrones season 8 or Attack on Titan's ending.",

There's so much in the Naruto-verse that can be explored and milk the franchise so to speak. There were so many unanswered questions raised during the flashbacks and I wish they would explore those more rather than trying to do Boruto. But hey, what do I know? I get that the creator and Jump wants to ride the wave while they can, but imho, this ain't the way to do it. Fine, go with the Boruto direction, but at the very least, they owe it to the fans to give us a better storyline and give the older characters the respect that they dully deserve. Anyway, Again, thank you for the clarification. I love Naruto bro. I used to think DBZ was the best Shonen Anime and I still love it, but Naruto surpassed it imo and we were treated with such great stories and character development. I hate it seeing it all thrown away for a bunch of copy pasta characters that has no substance to them.",

                    "body": "The thing is Boruto wasn't Kishimoto's idea. The way he ended Naruto it was very clear that he was done with the story. But because Naruto was fucking Naruto, Shonen Jump wanted a sequel series so Kishimoto's long-term assistants (Kodachi and Ikemoto) jumped on the project. Ikemoto does the drawings and Kodachi was doing the storyboard. Kishimoto was added as a supervisor but he pretty much all but said in interviews that he was done with the series.\n\nSo then Kishimoto took some time off and started a new manga, Samurai 8. Unfortunately, that got canceled in early 2020 so Kishimoto was kind of left in this weird place. \n\nThen in late 2020, Kishimoto took over the Boruto storyboard from Kodachi towards the end of the Kawaki arc (Right before Baryon Mode and the current episode). And yet when I read those chapters it really didn't feel like Kishimoto's ideas which makes sense considering he took control at the very end and was likely writing Kodachi's script. \n\nUnfortunately, I think it's too late for Kishimoto to write the series how he wants because it's been 5 years since it started and the foundations are set. I think the story and characters will improve but you can't really do much more than that so I don't really know why Kishimoto decided to come back and take control of Boruto.",

I felt the same way when I was reading through the Boruto manga and confused as to what direction they're wanting to head on to. I knew that Kishi had taken over for Kodachi but I wasn't aware of the circumstances to begin with. Boruto to me felt more of a fanfic than anything. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to remain optimistic and see the series course correct, but at this point the damage is far too gone imo. Im not even all that upset about Kurama or the next gen being pushed to the limelight, thats fine. Its the blatant disrespect of the old gen and I feel like Im just repeating myself. Its frustrating as a Naruto fan to see this. I decided to keep track and keep myself up to date on Boruto not because I want to, its because i cant justify my rant against it without knowing whats really going on. Still pains me to read each chapter and watch the anime.",

So that is also not an argument.\nGedo mazo is also something Obito learnt in mere hours. So again I don't see what Nagato did so much better. Madara has no use for the gedo mazo as his susanoo is superior in every way, by a mile. So why the fuvk would he use it?",

Nagato literally only could use the 2 rinnegan was because of his immense chakra reserve he got because he's an Uzumaki. If Obito was an Uzumaki hed also be able to use 2.\n\nAlso the ability you meant is a one time thing. It literally crippled Nagato after he used it and drained all of his life force.

Did you even watch the war arc climax?\n\nObito didn't need to use any of pains abilities...? Why tf should he use the gedo mazo thing on random Shinobi that aren't even a threat to him. He used the gedo mazo as a distraction so he could get the sages items and that worked. Infact everything except for Kabuto edoing Madara was going pretty much according to Obitos plan. Madara was revived they summoned the 10 tails, he temporarily became the juubis shell. And then Madaras plan took over.

Don't make me laugh\n\nNagato had his rinnegan for 30 or so years and Obito for 2 days after which he already managed to use the six paths which you claimed to be the magnum opus of the rinnegan at the beginning of this ridiculous debate. He also managed to use the gedo mazo instantly in full form. \n\nAs I've said multiple times so far, Madara used multiple abilities after mere minutes of having his rinnegan and instantly surpassed Nagato in it's uses. Including perfectly using the outer path which you conveniently seem to ignore as a feat so far. \nSasuke too instantly mastered his personal rinnegan use, pull and push, shibaku tensei and most importantly a genjutsu so strong he captured ALL 9 tailed beasts at once, meanwhile pain sucks ass at genjutsu.",

Also when was it stated that the members received any of that chakra?\n\n>And yet Obito said nothing about needing time to master the rinnegan. If you're going to be retarded why double down on it \n\n\nAre You braindead? You literally need time to learn the abilities. If Nagato is so good, how come he only found out how to use the abilities as a late teen? Obito learnt multiple in a day. That's far more impressive.\n\n> Of course he's not that great at it he wasn't born into the clan of asspulls\n\nThis is the funniest part.\n\nHow did it go from \"Nagato is the best Rinnegan user\" to \"of course he's not that great..\" \n\nI consider this debate a victory.

He's also in a powered up state using a power called Karma. He's just commandeering Boruto's body.\n\nBut yes, Boruto was already Chunin level before he graduated from the academy so he's easily jounin level now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>and rasengan is like carrying a ball of chakra that needs direct application to hit.\n\nNo, that is Naruto's Rasengan. Boruto's Vanishing Rasengan is a different jutsu. It literally disappears when it's thrown and then appears right when you've already been hit by it. A far stronger opponent than Sasuke has already been hit by one and they were in a far better state than Sasuke was when he got hit.",

Why the chakra fruit planted on earth has a collosal amount of chakra?\n\nA chakra fruit fully grows into a fruit every 1000\u20132000 years so we can assume that isshiki and kaguya lived on earth for millenniums. The chakra fruit absorbs chakra from the soil that is filled with blood and deaths of living things. The chakra in the fruit rapidly increases when the planet there is filled with wars and deaths meaning that humans fought each other despite that they are fighting their own kind hence since humans on earth wage wars and filled with brutal souls, the chakra fruit then increases in terms of chakra levels. Now, Kaguya consumed the significant and special chakra fruit making her the strongest and vicious on earth but somehow other otsutsuki are claimed to be better than her well I\u2019ll try to convince you all that kaguya is the strongest otsutsuki.\n\nMost of us have seen the fight between kaguya and team 7 and they annihilated her by putting their hands on her armpit. If I said so, why am I here trying to convince you all? because most of you guys watching naruto didnt think OUTSIDE THE BOX. Now, one of the reason kaguya got annihilated was because she was careless and got unlucky. Another reason is that she just got unsealed. What do I mean by that? If we calculate the time she has been, it will definitely be damn long Approximately 6000\u20139000 years No cap. Why has being sealed for a long period of time related to any of this? I\u2019ll give you an analogy,Guns -ak-47 LMG RPG any of those destructive weapons and compared it to the future ones for sure the future guns will be more destructive as Technology develops. Thus we must thoroughly comprehend the fact that kaguya has a disadvantage(being sealed) and outdated. So if kaguya wasn\u2019t sealed, she would have develop disastrous ninjitsu that cant be absorbed and difficult to dodge. Even if so she was just unsealed after thousand of years, she would be stronger than Isshiki because she didnt use all her abilities such as using the godly strength from the ten tailed beast. Kaguya did not have the final form of the ten tailed beast as chakra from the it was extracted and divided to tailed beasts. Another reason why Kaguya did not killed Naruto and Sasuke was because she wanted to drain their chakra.\n\n\nNaruto and Sasuke were basically sharing Kaguya's power. Every being in the world had Kaguya's chakra. She wanted to extract the chakra from Sasuke and Naruto as they possessed Collosal amount if chakra.\n\n\nAnd the most Proficient sealing jutsu on their palm\n\n\nShe also needed to be careful because if they were to put their palm on Kaguya,she would be sealed for eternity again. Unlike during Isshiki fight, he did not need to worry so much that would end his career. She would have annihilated them with ease. I mean like Kaguya had many oppurturnities to destroy them but she choose not to. Another huge factor is that she was old. She hasnt changed to another new vessel and her age is ten and thousands of years old. Despite being an alien species(techinically immortal) they are still living thing so they could die. What grants them immortality is due to the fact that once they changed their vessel they reborn.\n\nHere is the abilities of Kaguya\n\nDivine powers\n-interstellar travel, hypnosis, mind-reading abilities, memory-wipe, and creation of force fields and shock waves.\n\nDojutsus and kekkei genkai\n\n-Kaguya has access to the Byakugan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder with unparalleled vision, chakra detection, and aim; the Sharingan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder to create and deflect illusions, copy techniques of other ninjas, detect chakras and traps and eventually activate the Mangekyo Sharingan; as well as the Rinnegan, a Dojutsu that provides the wielder with godly powers of summoning creatures, controlling gravity, ripping souls, reading minds, killing people, resurrecting people, opening portals, creating phantom clones, and absorbing chakra amongst others.\n\nRinne Sharingan\n\n-Allows kaguya to cast infinite tsuyokomi and potentially to wipe out chakra from others, creation of portals and especially utilizing the god tree.\n\nEighty gods vaccum Attack\n\n-Eighty God Vacuum Attack, born out of her immense control over chakra. This powerful and pervalent jutsu allows Kaguya to wield chakra in both a defensive and offensive manner. Using this technique Kaguya can materialize an immense amount of chakra and use them to form massive chakra fists.\n\nThe technique is so strong that it causes rippling shock waves and can even destroy a full-body Susanoo with relative ease. It is also capable of destroying, a complete Six Paths Chakra Body\n\nAll-killing Ash bones\n\n-An absolute devastating power that she has. The ash killing bones will be produced from her palms. This attack is very lethal as it was seen to disintegerate the person into debris.\n\nExpansive Truth-seeking orbs\n\nKaguya managed to build up collosal amount of chakra and combine them together creating this devastating jutsu. This jutsu are composed of Ying-Yang Release, as well as each of the five nature transformations, this huge ball of chaos was intended by Kaguya to be used as a means to obliterate the world into nothing, only to perish them and get vengeance.\n\nWe can assume her raw chakra by seeing how enormous is the truth-seeking orb\n\nAmenominaka\n\nAmenominaka is a power that allows Kaguya Otsutsuki to create new dimensions on the fly and teleport herself, as well as anything or anyone else along with her to that dimension.\n\nHaving complete control over the individual elements in these created dimensions will surely make her a hard oppenent to defeat. once trapped in one it is very hard to escape these dimensions and return to the real world unless someone managed to forced kaguya to bring him/her back or with the help of rift jutsu. The anime only shows six dimensions, but Kaguya can definitely create more if she desires. The disadvantage is that she could not detect the location of the person in her dimensions but she could sense their chakra so it should help her searching them.",

            "body": "> All this is is you bitching that an orphaned child with no father figure doesn\u2019t know how to be a great father himself. This is perfectly realistic and quite honestly some of the most grounded writing in all of Naruto. \n\nStopped reading right here since you have apparently completely and utterly missed the entire point. It's not about just being a bad father, Naruto Uzumaki does *not go back on his word*, ever. And he did so, against his own family, to do *paperwork* . That's called character assassination for plot, there is no conceivable defense or excuse. \n\n> First of all, Naruto still has SPSM and he CAN still fly. Im starting to doubt that you even read or watch the series\n\nDid you even read what I said? I know he still has Six Paths Sage Mode, the point was that he literally *never uses it*  when he absolutely 100% should. He can create Truth Seeking Orbs literally whenever he wants, he just never does because lol plot.\n\n>  The toads would do literally nothing with the current power scaling in the series, don\u2019t know why you even brought them up.\n\nAgain your lack of reading comprehension shines through. I'm talking about all of Boruto, not just their recent fights against bullshit Otsutsuki like Ishiki and Jigen. Though thanks for reaffirming why the power scaling is completely broken and the show has literally turned into a wanna-be knock off of DBZ while abandoning everything that made ninja combat interesting to begin with.\n\n> Prove that Naruto and Sasuke are weaker than they were in the war, until you do this paragraph is completely irrelevant.\n\nNaruto dodged a literal light speed attack from Madara in the war, and Sasuke is capable of keeping up with the same speed of attacks as well. Bullshit they cannot keep up with these new Otsutsuki. And in terms of pure destructive power, go re-watch Naruto: The Last a canon movie. The power Naruto displays in his fight against Toneri and Sasuke literally one-shotting a meteor with a Chidori are levels of strength from them that are never once present in Boruto, where they should be even stronger than before (at least in Sasuke's case)\n\n> Jutsu negation has been a thing with almost every single enemy since the early war.\n\nAnd when did I ever claim that was a good thing? Late Shippuden had its issues but the excuse was that it was the literal end of the series and these crazy abilities were from the endgame villains, not something that just casually shows up every other week. The entire situation was supposed to be exceptional and not the norm for the Shinobi world and wars of the past, hence the literal 1000 year plan coming to fruition. You're literally just proving my point about lazy writing, they could have easily *improved* on this and not kept doing it, but they did so instead because fuck it.\n\n>  For the Android argument. I guess Dragon Ball fucking sucks too or literally any other manga with strong artificial enemies. \n\nNo, because Dragon Ball is Dragon Ball and Naruto is supposed to be Naruto. Again you missed the entire fucking point, Naruto becoming DBZ isn't a fucking good thing, and as I said cyborgs of that power level magically being created with 0 in universe explanation a mere less than 20 years after the 4th Great War, in a world that doesn't even have cars or jet engines, is beyond stupid.\n\n> The Kage literally were able to restrain Kinshiki and almost kill him. Gaara and Chojuro WITHOUT THEIR WEAPONS were able to dominate Urashiki making him run away lol.\n\nThey were immediately fodderized by Momoshiki and would be instantly eviscerated by Jigen and Ishiki. And those are the current power levels now, they are only going to keep going higher and the series hasn't even entered a fucking time skip yet. The pacing with the power scaling is beyond absurd and as I said, a massive detriment to the series and world building. To put this in comparison, it's like having an enemy appear in Part 1 Naruto that one shots all of the Sannin and Kage during the Chunin Exams arc and telling us that's who Naruto, who just won a fight against Kiba with a fart, is going to fight.\n\n> The Hokage can not personally deal with every issue that comes up. This is shown in Naruto too where Naruto constantly does Tsunades bidding.\n\nTsunade couldn't enter a world spanning Sage Mode for tracking instantaneously, nor could she literally make thousands of perfect copies of herself all with godlike power and speed. Naruto can, the minute that first team he sent out died it was 100% his responsibility to get the fuck off his ass and go make sure his son was safe and the issue resolved, yet he just sent another team to their deaths and continued to let his child remain in mortal danger while citing a \"political issue\" that we know for a fact does not exist in their world due to his relationship with Kurostuchi and all of the Kage. Please keep making more dogshit excuses for these ridiculous situations that are clearly only there to try and give Boruto the spotlight while throwing out all logic, lazy writers love mindless viewers/reader such as yourself.\n\nAnd of course I haven't seen literally every single episode of Boruto, I'm not sitting through 218 fucking episodes of dogshit to try and sniff out the tiny nuggets you claim are actually good. No other series gets to air for 4 years with such a horrible track record and still get called \"good\" lmao. I have kept up in passing and paid attention to all the major arcs and plot developments, and every single one has only disappointed me further. It's so bad nowadays that watching Naruto or Shippuden and then turning on an episode of Boruto makes it seem like they almost take place in completely different worlds.\n\nYou clearly have no fucking clue what made the characters or this series what they were, which doesn't surprise me considering you enjoy the mindless, lazy cash-grab sequel that is Boruto and \"the old gen getting trashed\" so I'm not even going to waste any further time with you. Enjoy your low effort dogshit, it's just non-canon fanfiction to me.",

Try fucking reading next time.\n\nAfter this latest fight though I'm done with the series and have concluded it's irredeemable trash. If you can't impress me after 218 episodes and 4 fucking years of runtime then it's just not happening lmao, no other series gets away with being shit for that long and still gets a chance to be called \"good\"\n\nThe fact that that's the weak ass response you can give me other than \"it took you a long time to write that lol!\" (it took like 6 minutes) is proof enough you can't actually \"debunk\" what I've said and know jack shit about what made Naruto and its characters the series it was, and just how badly Boruto has shit on all of it.\n\nKeep enjoying the garbage though, hack writers love when mindless people like you eat it all up just like people who enjoyed shit like Game of Thrones season 8 or Attack on Titan's ending.",

But because Naruto was fucking Naruto, Shonen Jump wanted a sequel series so Kishimoto's long-term assistants (Kodachi and Ikemoto) jumped on the project. Ikemoto does the drawings and Kodachi was doing the storyboard. Kishimoto was added as a supervisor but he pretty much all but said in interviews that he was done with the series.\n\nSo then Kishimoto took some time off and started a new manga, Samurai 8. Unfortunately, that got canceled in early 2020 so Kishimoto was kind of left in this weird place. \n\nThen in late 2020, Kishimoto took over the Boruto storyboard from Kodachi towards the end of the Kawaki arc (Right before Baryon Mode and the current episode). And yet when I read those chapters it really didn't feel like Kishimoto's ideas which makes sense considering he took control at the very end and was likely writing Kodachi's script. \n\nUnfortunately, I think it's too late for Kishimoto to write the series how he wants because it's been 5 years since it started and the foundations are set. I think the story and characters will improve but you can't really do much more than that so I don't really know why Kishimoto decided to come back and take control of Boruto.",

Boruto to me felt more of a fanfic than anything. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to remain optimistic and see the series course correct, but at this point the damage is far too gone imo. Im not even all that upset about Kurama or the next gen being pushed to the limelight, thats fine. Its the blatant disrespect of the old gen and I feel like Im just repeating myself. Its frustrating as a Naruto fan to see this. I decided to keep track and keep myself up to date on Boruto not because I want to, its because i cant justify my rant against it without knowing whats really going on.

So that is also not an argument.\nGedo mazo is also something Obito learnt in mere hours. So again I don't see what Nagato did so much better.

Nagato literally only could use the 2 rinnegan was because of his immense chakra reserve he got because he's an Uzumaki.

Don't make me laugh\n\nNagato had his rinnegan for 30 or so years and Obito for 2 days after which he already managed to use the six paths which you claimed to be the magnum opus of the rinnegan at the beginning of this ridiculous debate. He also managed to use the gedo mazo instantly in full form. \n\nAs I've said multiple times so far, Madara used multiple abilities after mere minutes of having his rinnegan and instantly surpassed Nagato in it's uses. Including perfectly using the outer path which you conveniently seem to ignore as a feat so far. \nSasuke too instantly mastered his personal rinnegan use, pull and push, shibaku tensei and most importantly a genjutsu so strong he captured ALL 9 tailed beasts at once, meanwhile pain sucks ass at genjutsu.",

Why the chakra fruit planted on earth has a collosal amount of chakra?\n\nA chakra fruit fully grows into a fruit every 1000\u20132000 years so we can assume that isshiki and kaguya lived on earth for millenniums. The chakra fruit absorbs chakra from the soil that is filled with blood and deaths of living things. The chakra in the fruit rapidly increases when the planet there is filled with wars and deaths meaning that humans fought each other despite that they are fighting their own kind hence since humans on earth wage wars and filled with brutal souls, the chakra fruit then increases in terms of chakra levels. Now, Kaguya consumed the significant and special chakra fruit making her the strongest and vicious on earth but somehow other otsutsuki are claimed to be better than her well I\u2019ll try to convince you all that kaguya is the strongest otsutsuki.\n\nMost of us have seen the fight between kaguya and team 7 and they annihilated her by putting their hands on her armpit. If I said so, why am I here trying to convince you all? because most of you guys watching naruto didnt think OUTSIDE THE BOX. Now, one of the reason kaguya got annihilated was because she was careless and got unlucky. Another reason is that she just got unsealed. What do I mean by that? If we calculate the time she has been, it will definitely be damn long Approximately 6000\u20139000 years No cap. Why has being sealed for a long period of time related to any of this? I\u2019ll give you an analogy,Guns -ak-47 LMG RPG any of those destructive weapons and compared it to the future ones for sure the future guns will be more destructive as Technology develops. Thus we must thoroughly comprehend the fact that kaguya has a disadvantage(being sealed) and outdated. So if kaguya wasn\u2019t sealed, she would have develop disastrous ninjitsu that cant be absorbed and difficult to dodge. Even if so she was just unsealed after thousand of years, she would be stronger than Isshiki because she didnt use all her abilities such as using the godly strength from the ten tailed beast. Kaguya did not have the final form of the ten tailed beast as chakra from the it was extracted and divided to tailed beasts. Another reason why Kaguya did not killed Naruto and Sasuke was because she wanted to drain their chakra.\n\n\nNaruto and Sasuke were basically sharing Kaguya's power. Every being in the world had Kaguya's chakra. She wanted to extract the chakra from Sasuke and Naruto as they possessed Collosal amount if chakra.\n\n\nAnd the most Proficient sealing jutsu on their palm\n\n\nShe also needed to be careful because if they were to put their palm on Kaguya,she would be sealed for eternity again. Unlike during Isshiki fight, he did not need to worry so much that would end his career. She would have annihilated them with ease. I mean like Kaguya had many oppurturnities to destroy them but she choose not to. Another huge factor is that she was old. She hasnt changed to another new vessel and her age is ten and thousands of years old. Despite being an alien species(techinically immortal) they are still living thing so they could die. What grants them immortality is due to the fact that once they changed their vessel they reborn.\n\nHere is the abilities of Kaguya\n\nDivine powers\n-interstellar travel, hypnosis, mind-reading abilities, memory-wipe, and creation of force fields and shock waves.\n\nDojutsus and kekkei genkai\n\n-Kaguya has access to the Byakugan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder with unparalleled vision, chakra detection, and aim; the Sharingan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder to create and deflect illusions, copy techniques of other ninjas, detect chakras and traps and eventually activate the Mangekyo Sharingan; as well as the Rinnegan, a Dojutsu that provides the wielder with godly powers of summoning creatures, controlling gravity, ripping souls, reading minds, killing people, resurrecting people, opening portals, creating phantom clones, and absorbing chakra amongst others.\n\nRinne Sharingan\n\n-Allows kaguya to cast infinite tsuyokomi and potentially to wipe out chakra from others, creation of portals and especially utilizing the god tree.\n\nEighty gods vaccum Attack\n\n-Eighty God Vacuum Attack, born out of her immense control over chakra. This powerful and pervalent jutsu allows Kaguya to wield chakra in both a defensive and offensive manner. Using this technique Kaguya can materialize an immense amount of chakra and use them to form massive chakra fists.\n\nThe technique is so strong that it causes rippling shock waves and can even destroy a full-body Susanoo with relative ease. It is also capable of destroying, a complete Six Paths Chakra Body\n\nAll-killing Ash bones\n\n-An absolute devastating power that she has. The ash killing bones will be produced from her palms. This attack is very lethal as it was seen to disintegerate the person into debris.\n\nExpansive Truth-seeking orbs\n\nKaguya managed to build up collosal amount of chakra and combine them together creating this devastating jutsu. This jutsu are composed of Ying-Yang Release, as well as each of the five nature transformations, this huge ball of chaos was intended by Kaguya to be used as a means to obliterate the world into nothing, only to perish them and get vengeance.\n\nWe can assume her raw chakra by seeing how enormous is the truth-seeking orb\n\nAmenominaka\n\nAmenominaka is a power that allows Kaguya Otsutsuki to create new dimensions on the fly and teleport herself, as well as anything or anyone else along with her to that dimension.\n\nHaving complete control over the individual elements in these created dimensions will surely make her a hard oppenent to defeat. once trapped in one it is very hard to escape these dimensions and return to the real world unless someone managed to forced kaguya to bring him/her back or with the help of rift jutsu. The anime only shows six dimensions, but Kaguya can definitely create more if she desires. The disadvantage is that she could not detect the location of the person in her dimensions but she could sense their chakra so it should help her searching them.",

Try fucking reading next time.\n\nAfter this latest fight though I'm done with the series and have concluded it's irredeemable trash. If you can't impress me after 218 episodes and 4 fucking years of runtime then it's just not happening lmao, no other series gets away with being shit for that long and still gets a chance to be called \"good\"\n\nThe fact that that's the weak ass response you can give me other than \"it took you a long time to write that lol!\" (it took like 6 minutes) is proof enough you can't actually \"debunk\" what I've said and know jack shit about what made Naruto and its characters the series it was, and just how badly Boruto has shit on all of it.\n\nKeep enjoying the garbage though, hack writers love when mindless people like you eat it all up just like people who enjoyed shit like Game of Thrones season 8 or Attack on Titan's ending.",

I knew that Kishi had taken over for Kodachi but I wasn't aware of the circumstances to begin with. Boruto to me felt more of a fanfic than anything. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to remain optimistic and see the series course correct, but at this point the damage is far too gone imo. Im not even all that upset about Kurama or the next gen being pushed to the limelight, thats fine. Its the blatant disrespect of the old gen and I feel like Im just repeating myself. Its frustrating as a Naruto fan to see this. I decided to keep track and keep myself up to date on Boruto not because I want to, its because i cant justify my rant against it without knowing whats really going on. Still pains me to read each chapter and watch the anime.",

So that is also not an argument.\nGedo mazo is also something Obito learnt in mere hours. So again I don't see what Nagato did so much better. Madara has no use for the gedo mazo as his susanoo is superior in every way, by a mile. So why the fuvk would he use it?",

The rinnegan was hard for him to use because it want his and he has low chakra reserves compared to Nagato. But wtf do you mean he want adept with it. He used the six paths.

You said the others are just better because they're stronger and how that doesn't count but now you use the fact that Nagato literally just has more chakra than Obito by default as a testament to nagatos skill? Nagato literally only could use the 2 rinnegan was because of his immense chakra reserve he got because he's an Uzumaki. If Obito was an Uzumaki hed also be able to use 2.\n\nAlso the ability you meant is a one time thing. It literally crippled Nagato after he used it and drained all of his life force.

He used the gedo mazo as a distraction so he could get the sages items and that worked. Infact everything except for Kabuto edoing Madara was going pretty much according to Obitos plan. Madara was revived they summoned the 10 tails, he temporarily became the juubis shell. And then Madaras plan took over. When in these instances would he have needed to use shinra tensei or some shit?",

Don't make me laugh\n\nNagato had his rinnegan for 30 or so years and Obito for 2 days after which he already managed to use the six paths which you claimed to be the magnum opus of the rinnegan at the beginning of this ridiculous debate. He also managed to use the gedo mazo instantly in full form. \n\nAs I've said multiple times so far, Madara used multiple abilities after mere minutes of having his rinnegan and instantly surpassed Nagato in it's uses. Including perfectly using the outer path which you conveniently seem to ignore as a feat so far. \nSasuke too instantly mastered his personal rinnegan use, pull and push, shibaku tensei and most importantly a genjutsu so strong he captured ALL 9 tailed beasts at once, meanwhile pain sucks ass at genjutsu.",

Why the chakra fruit planted on earth has a collosal amount of chakra?\n\nA chakra fruit fully grows into a fruit every 1000\u20132000 years so we can assume that isshiki and kaguya lived on earth for millenniums. The chakra fruit absorbs chakra from the soil that is filled with blood and deaths of living things. The chakra in the fruit rapidly increases when the planet there is filled with wars and deaths meaning that humans fought each other despite that they are fighting their own kind hence since humans on earth wage wars and filled with brutal souls, the chakra fruit then increases in terms of chakra levels. Now, Kaguya consumed the significant and special chakra fruit making her the strongest and vicious on earth but somehow other otsutsuki are claimed to be better than her well I\u2019ll try to convince you all that kaguya is the strongest otsutsuki.\n\nMost of us have seen the fight between kaguya and team 7 and they annihilated her by putting their hands on her armpit. If I said so, why am I here trying to convince you all? because most of you guys watching naruto didnt think OUTSIDE THE BOX. Now, one of the reason kaguya got annihilated was because she was careless and got unlucky. Another reason is that she just got unsealed. What do I mean by that? If we calculate the time she has been, it will definitely be damn long Approximately 6000\u20139000 years No cap. Why has being sealed for a long period of time related to any of this? I\u2019ll give you an analogy,Guns -ak-47 LMG RPG any of those destructive weapons and compared it to the future ones for sure the future guns will be more destructive as Technology develops. Thus we must thoroughly comprehend the fact that kaguya has a disadvantage(being sealed) and outdated. So if kaguya wasn\u2019t sealed, she would have develop disastrous ninjitsu that cant be absorbed and difficult to dodge. Even if so she was just unsealed after thousand of years, she would be stronger than Isshiki because she didnt use all her abilities such as using the godly strength from the ten tailed beast. Kaguya did not have the final form of the ten tailed beast as chakra from the it was extracted and divided to tailed beasts. Another reason why Kaguya did not killed Naruto and Sasuke was because she wanted to drain their chakra.\n\n\nNaruto and Sasuke were basically sharing Kaguya's power. Every being in the world had Kaguya's chakra. She wanted to extract the chakra from Sasuke and Naruto as they possessed Collosal amount if chakra.\n\n\nAnd the most Proficient sealing jutsu on their palm\n\n\nShe also needed to be careful because if they were to put their palm on Kaguya,she would be sealed for eternity again. Unlike during Isshiki fight, he did not need to worry so much that would end his career. She would have annihilated them with ease. I mean like Kaguya had many oppurturnities to destroy them but she choose not to. Another huge factor is that she was old. She hasnt changed to another new vessel and her age is ten and thousands of years old. Despite being an alien species(techinically immortal) they are still living thing so they could die. What grants them immortality is due to the fact that once they changed their vessel they reborn.\n\nHere is the abilities of Kaguya\n\nDivine powers\n-interstellar travel, hypnosis, mind-reading abilities, memory-wipe, and creation of force fields and shock waves.\n\nDojutsus and kekkei genkai\n\n-Kaguya has access to the Byakugan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder with unparalleled vision, chakra detection, and aim; the Sharingan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder to create and deflect illusions, copy techniques of other ninjas, detect chakras and traps and eventually activate the Mangekyo Sharingan; as well as the Rinnegan, a Dojutsu that provides the wielder with godly powers of summoning creatures, controlling gravity, ripping souls, reading minds, killing people, resurrecting people, opening portals, creating phantom clones, and absorbing chakra amongst others.\n\nRinne Sharingan\n\n-Allows kaguya to cast infinite tsuyokomi and potentially to wipe out chakra from others, creation of portals and especially utilizing the god tree.\n\nEighty gods vaccum Attack\n\n-Eighty God Vacuum Attack, born out of her immense control over chakra. This powerful and pervalent jutsu allows Kaguya to wield chakra in both a defensive and offensive manner. Using this technique Kaguya can materialize an immense amount of chakra and use them to form massive chakra fists.\n\nThe technique is so strong that it causes rippling shock waves and can even destroy a full-body Susanoo with relative ease. It is also capable of destroying, a complete Six Paths Chakra Body\n\nAll-killing Ash bones\n\n-An absolute devastating power that she has. The ash killing bones will be produced from her palms. This attack is very lethal as it was seen to disintegerate the person into debris.\n\nExpansive Truth-seeking orbs\n\nKaguya managed to build up collosal amount of chakra and combine them together creating this devastating jutsu. This jutsu are composed of Ying-Yang Release, as well as each of the five nature transformations, this huge ball of chaos was intended by Kaguya to be used as a means to obliterate the world into nothing, only to perish them and get vengeance.\n\nWe can assume her raw chakra by seeing how enormous is the truth-seeking orb\n\nAmenominaka\n\nAmenominaka is a power that allows Kaguya Otsutsuki to create new dimensions on the fly and teleport herself, as well as anything or anyone else along with her to that dimension.\n\nHaving complete control over the individual elements in these created dimensions will surely make her a hard oppenent to defeat. once trapped in one it is very hard to escape these dimensions and return to the real world unless someone managed to forced kaguya to bring him/her back or with the help of rift jutsu. The anime only shows six dimensions, but Kaguya can definitely create more if she desires. The disadvantage is that she could not detect the location of the person in her dimensions but she could sense their chakra so it should help her searching them.",

Try fucking reading next time.\n\nAfter this latest fight though I'm done with the series and have concluded it's irredeemable trash. If you can't impress me after 218 episodes and 4 fucking years of runtime then it's just not happening lmao, no other series gets away with being shit for that long and still gets a chance to be called \"good\"\n\nThe fact that that's the weak ass response you can give me other than \"it took you a long time to write that lol!\" (it took like 6 minutes) is proof enough you can't actually \"debunk\" what I've said and know jack shit about what made Naruto and its characters the series it was, and just how badly Boruto has shit on all of it.\n\nKeep enjoying the garbage though, hack writers love when mindless people like you eat it all up just like people who enjoyed shit like Game of Thrones season 8 or Attack on Titan's ending.",

The zombie thing is completely braindead as \n1) alive Madara has MUCH more chakra than Edo (Edo tenseis have as much as their summoner except it cannot deplete) meaning he could normally probably do more, which HE DID later when fighting Sasuke and Naruto, except he'd have water chakra.\n\nThe six paths are also not as impressive as you state as Obito, the only rinnegan user who wasn't as adapt at it as Nagato was, was able to do it after Less than a week of having it on 6 much more powerful bodies and control the tailed beast included in them. So that is also not an argument.\nGedo mazo is also something Obito learnt in mere hours. So again I don't see what Nagato did so much better. Madara has no use for the gedo mazo as his susanoo is superior in every way, by a mile. So why the fuvk would he use it?",

He said the rinnegan was too strong and he could barely handle it so all that he was super adept with it talk after a week makes no sense. He only knows how to summon it he didnt do what nagato did.

Pay more attention to both the show and this discussion and stop accusing me of not paying attention when clearly you should do some more of that yourself.\n\nBruh that is another testament to you not paying attention. The rinnegan was hard for him to use because it want his and he has low chakra reserves compared to Nagato. But wtf do you mean he want adept with it. He used the six paths. He had 6 Jinchuuriki with him you numbskull. Gedo mazo can't one shot anyone where tf do you get that random ass assumption. And Obito summoned the entire thing during the war arc.

Obito said just one of them was too strong for him in his very own words and Kakashi and Gai noted that he couldn't use pains abilities that's all on panel my boi. You're saying he did 1  minor thing out of all the abilities it has when Obito said he'd lose himself using it to its fullest extent. You mean taking people's souls isn't a 1 shot option ? I mustve watched another fight them. Obito summoned it and didn't do shit with it not the same",

You said the others are just better because they're stronger and how that doesn't count but now you use the fact that Nagato literally just has more chakra than Obito by default as a testament to nagatos skill? Nagato literally only could use the 2 rinnegan was because of his immense chakra reserve he got because he's an Uzumaki. If Obito was an Uzumaki hed also be able to use 2.\n\nAlso the ability you meant is a one time thing. It literally crippled Nagato after he used it and drained all of his life force. Why would Obito cripple himself when he was only using gedo mazo as a distraction???? You must have been doing something else than watching Naruto cuz u don't know shit about it",

Remember the same Nagato whose cock your gargling rn, needed help of 9 other Akatsuki over the time of 3 days to do that same thing for every tailed beast. Don't make me laugh\n\nNagato had his rinnegan for 30 or so years and Obito for 2 days after which he already managed to use the six paths which you claimed to be the magnum opus of the rinnegan at the beginning of this ridiculous debate. He also managed to use the gedo mazo instantly in full form. \n\nAs I've said multiple times so far, Madara used multiple abilities after mere minutes of having his rinnegan and instantly surpassed Nagato in it's uses. Including perfectly using the outer path which you conveniently seem to ignore as a feat so far. \nSasuke too instantly mastered his personal rinnegan use, pull and push, shibaku tensei and most importantly a genjutsu so strong he captured ALL 9 tailed beasts at once, meanwhile pain sucks ass at genjutsu.",

If Nagato is so good, how come he only found out how to use the abilities as a late teen? Obito learnt multiple in a day. That's far more impressive.\n\n> Of course he's not that great at it he wasn't born into the clan of asspulls\n\nThis is the funniest part.\n\nHow did it go from \"Nagato is the best Rinnegan user\" to \"of course he's not that great..\" \n\nI consider this debate a victory.

Why the chakra fruit planted on earth has a collosal amount of chakra?\n\nA chakra fruit fully grows into a fruit every 1000\u20132000 years so we can assume that isshiki and kaguya lived on earth for millenniums. The chakra fruit absorbs chakra from the soil that is filled with blood and deaths of living things. The chakra in the fruit rapidly increases when the planet there is filled with wars and deaths meaning that humans fought each other despite that they are fighting their own kind hence since humans on earth wage wars and filled with brutal souls, the chakra fruit then increases in terms of chakra levels. Now, Kaguya consumed the significant and special chakra fruit making her the strongest and vicious on earth but somehow other otsutsuki are claimed to be better than her well I\u2019ll try to convince you all that kaguya is the strongest otsutsuki.\n\nMost of us have seen the fight between kaguya and team 7 and they annihilated her by putting their hands on her armpit. If I said so, why am I here trying to convince you all? because most of you guys watching naruto didnt think OUTSIDE THE BOX. Now, one of the reason kaguya got annihilated was because she was careless and got unlucky. Another reason is that she just got unsealed. What do I mean by that? If we calculate the time she has been, it will definitely be damn long Approximately 6000\u20139000 years No cap. Why has being sealed for a long period of time related to any of this? I\u2019ll give you an analogy,Guns -ak-47 LMG RPG any of those destructive weapons and compared it to the future ones for sure the future guns will be more destructive as Technology develops. Thus we must thoroughly comprehend the fact that kaguya has a disadvantage(being sealed) and outdated. So if kaguya wasn\u2019t sealed, she would have develop disastrous ninjitsu that cant be absorbed and difficult to dodge. Even if so she was just unsealed after thousand of years, she would be stronger than Isshiki because she didnt use all her abilities such as using the godly strength from the ten tailed beast. Kaguya did not have the final form of the ten tailed beast as chakra from the it was extracted and divided to tailed beasts. Another reason why Kaguya did not killed Naruto and Sasuke was because she wanted to drain their chakra.\n\n\nNaruto and Sasuke were basically sharing Kaguya's power. Every being in the world had Kaguya's chakra. She wanted to extract the chakra from Sasuke and Naruto as they possessed Collosal amount if chakra.\n\n\nAnd the most Proficient sealing jutsu on their palm\n\n\nShe also needed to be careful because if they were to put their palm on Kaguya,she would be sealed for eternity again. Unlike during Isshiki fight, he did not need to worry so much that would end his career. She would have annihilated them with ease. I mean like Kaguya had many oppurturnities to destroy them but she choose not to. Another huge factor is that she was old. She hasnt changed to another new vessel and her age is ten and thousands of years old. Despite being an alien species(techinically immortal) they are still living thing so they could die. What grants them immortality is due to the fact that once they changed their vessel they reborn.\n\nHere is the abilities of Kaguya\n\nDivine powers\n-interstellar travel, hypnosis, mind-reading abilities, memory-wipe, and creation of force fields and shock waves.\n\nDojutsus and kekkei genkai\n\n-Kaguya has access to the Byakugan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder with unparalleled vision, chakra detection, and aim; the Sharingan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder to create and deflect illusions, copy techniques of other ninjas, detect chakras and traps and eventually activate the Mangekyo Sharingan; as well as the Rinnegan, a Dojutsu that provides the wielder with godly powers of summoning creatures, controlling gravity, ripping souls, reading minds, killing people, resurrecting people, opening portals, creating phantom clones, and absorbing chakra amongst others.\n\nRinne Sharingan\n\n-Allows kaguya to cast infinite tsuyokomi and potentially to wipe out chakra from others, creation of portals and especially utilizing the god tree.\n\nEighty gods vaccum Attack\n\n-Eighty God Vacuum Attack, born out of her immense control over chakra. This powerful and pervalent jutsu allows Kaguya to wield chakra in both a defensive and offensive manner. Using this technique Kaguya can materialize an immense amount of chakra and use them to form massive chakra fists.\n\nThe technique is so strong that it causes rippling shock waves and can even destroy a full-body Susanoo with relative ease. It is also capable of destroying, a complete Six Paths Chakra Body\n\nAll-killing Ash bones\n\n-An absolute devastating power that she has. The ash killing bones will be produced from her palms. This attack is very lethal as it was seen to disintegerate the person into debris.\n\nExpansive Truth-seeking orbs\n\nKaguya managed to build up collosal amount of chakra and combine them together creating this devastating jutsu. This jutsu are composed of Ying-Yang Release, as well as each of the five nature transformations, this huge ball of chaos was intended by Kaguya to be used as a means to obliterate the world into nothing, only to perish them and get vengeance.\n\nWe can assume her raw chakra by seeing how enormous is the truth-seeking orb\n\nAmenominaka\n\nAmenominaka is a power that allows Kaguya Otsutsuki to create new dimensions on the fly and teleport herself, as well as anything or anyone else along with her to that dimension.\n\nHaving complete control over the individual elements in these created dimensions will surely make her a hard oppenent to defeat. once trapped in one it is very hard to escape these dimensions and return to the real world unless someone managed to forced kaguya to bring him/her back or with the help of rift jutsu. The anime only shows six dimensions, but Kaguya can definitely create more if she desires. The disadvantage is that she could not detect the location of the person in her dimensions but she could sense their chakra so it should help her searching them.",

So that is also not an argument.\nGedo mazo is also something Obito learnt in mere hours. So again I don't see what Nagato did so much better. Madara has no use for the gedo mazo as his susanoo is superior in every way, by a mile. So why the fuvk would he use it?",

The rinnegan was hard for him to use because it want his and he has low chakra reserves compared to Nagato. But wtf do you mean he want adept with it. He used the six paths. He had 6 Jinchuuriki with him you numbskull. Gedo mazo can't one shot anyone where tf do you get that random ass assumption. And Obito summoned the entire thing during the war arc.

You're saying he did 1  minor thing out of all the abilities it has when Obito said he'd lose himself using it to its fullest extent. You mean taking people's souls isn't a 1 shot option ?

You said the others are just better because they're stronger and how that doesn't count but now you use the fact that Nagato literally just has more chakra than Obito by default as a testament to nagatos skill? Nagato literally only could use the 2 rinnegan was because of his immense chakra reserve he got because he's an Uzumaki. If Obito was an Uzumaki hed also be able to use 2.\n\nAlso the ability you meant is a one time thing. It literally crippled Nagato after he used it and drained all of his life force. Why would Obito cripple himself when he was only using gedo mazo as a distraction???? You must have been doing something else than watching Naruto cuz u don't know shit about it",

Obito didn't show that he was more skilled with it pure and simple didn't say anything about chakra. He didn't have to pick the jinchuriki he could've used his own body for rinnegan techniques. You know who was a walking chakra battery ? Fucking Naruto both Pain and Sasuke walked up and took it from him. If you want to say Tenten Is more skilled with the sages chakra weapons than the gold and silver Brothers you go on right ahead \n\nUh no the gedo mazo needs to have sacrifices to be controlled. Nagato wasn't Uchiha or senju so the sacrifice was himself. Obito and Madara just use blood to control it",

Obito didn't show that he was more skilled with it pure and simple didn't say anything about chakra. He didn't have to pick the jinchuriki he could've used his own body for rinnegan techniques. You know who was a walking chakra battery ? Fucking Naruto both Pain and Sasuke walked up and took it from him. If you want to say Tenten Is more skilled with the sages chakra weapons than the gold and silver Brothers you go on right ahead \n\nWhat is your point? Obito couldn't be better with the rinnegan because he has no chakra. I literally explained that already, if he had as much as Nagato he'd easily outclass him. What are you getting at?",

Also when was it stated that the members received any of that chakra?\n\n>And yet Obito said nothing about needing time to master the rinnegan. If you're going to be retarded why double down on it \n\n\nAre You braindead? You literally need time to learn the abilities. If Nagato is so good, how come he only found out how to use the abilities as a late teen? Obito learnt multiple in a day. That's far more impressive.\n\n> Of course he's not that great at it he wasn't born into the clan of asspulls\n\nThis is the funniest part.\n\nHow did it go from \"Nagato is the best Rinnegan user\" to \"of course he's not that great..\" \n\nI consider this debate a victory.

Why the chakra fruit planted on earth has a collosal amount of chakra?\n\nA chakra fruit fully grows into a fruit every 1000\u20132000 years so we can assume that isshiki and kaguya lived on earth for millenniums. The chakra fruit absorbs chakra from the soil that is filled with blood and deaths of living things. The chakra in the fruit rapidly increases when the planet there is filled with wars and deaths meaning that humans fought each other despite that they are fighting their own kind hence since humans on earth wage wars and filled with brutal souls, the chakra fruit then increases in terms of chakra levels. Now, Kaguya consumed the significant and special chakra fruit making her the strongest and vicious on earth but somehow other otsutsuki are claimed to be better than her well I\u2019ll try to convince you all that kaguya is the strongest otsutsuki.\n\nMost of us have seen the fight between kaguya and team 7 and they annihilated her by putting their hands on her armpit. If I said so, why am I here trying to convince you all? because most of you guys watching naruto didnt think OUTSIDE THE BOX. Now, one of the reason kaguya got annihilated was because she was careless and got unlucky. Another reason is that she just got unsealed. What do I mean by that? If we calculate the time she has been, it will definitely be damn long Approximately 6000\u20139000 years No cap. Why has being sealed for a long period of time related to any of this? I\u2019ll give you an analogy,Guns -ak-47 LMG RPG any of those destructive weapons and compared it to the future ones for sure the future guns will be more destructive as Technology develops. Thus we must thoroughly comprehend the fact that kaguya has a disadvantage(being sealed) and outdated. So if kaguya wasn\u2019t sealed, she would have develop disastrous ninjitsu that cant be absorbed and difficult to dodge. Even if so she was just unsealed after thousand of years, she would be stronger than Isshiki because she didnt use all her abilities such as using the godly strength from the ten tailed beast. Kaguya did not have the final form of the ten tailed beast as chakra from the it was extracted and divided to tailed beasts. Another reason why Kaguya did not killed Naruto and Sasuke was because she wanted to drain their chakra.\n\n\nNaruto and Sasuke were basically sharing Kaguya's power. Every being in the world had Kaguya's chakra. She wanted to extract the chakra from Sasuke and Naruto as they possessed Collosal amount if chakra.\n\n\nAnd the most Proficient sealing jutsu on their palm\n\n\nShe also needed to be careful because if they were to put their palm on Kaguya,she would be sealed for eternity again. Unlike during Isshiki fight, he did not need to worry so much that would end his career. She would have annihilated them with ease. I mean like Kaguya had many oppurturnities to destroy them but she choose not to. Another huge factor is that she was old. She hasnt changed to another new vessel and her age is ten and thousands of years old. Despite being an alien species(techinically immortal) they are still living thing so they could die. What grants them immortality is due to the fact that once they changed their vessel they reborn.\n\nHere is the abilities of Kaguya\n\nDivine powers\n-interstellar travel, hypnosis, mind-reading abilities, memory-wipe, and creation of force fields and shock waves.\n\nDojutsus and kekkei genkai\n\n-Kaguya has access to the Byakugan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder with unparalleled vision, chakra detection, and aim; the Sharingan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder to create and deflect illusions, copy techniques of other ninjas, detect chakras and traps and eventually activate the Mangekyo Sharingan; as well as the Rinnegan, a Dojutsu that provides the wielder with godly powers of summoning creatures, controlling gravity, ripping souls, reading minds, killing people, resurrecting people, opening portals, creating phantom clones, and absorbing chakra amongst others.\n\nRinne Sharingan\n\n-Allows kaguya to cast infinite tsuyokomi and potentially to wipe out chakra from others, creation of portals and especially utilizing the god tree.\n\nEighty gods vaccum Attack\n\n-Eighty God Vacuum Attack, born out of her immense control over chakra. This powerful and pervalent jutsu allows Kaguya to wield chakra in both a defensive and offensive manner. Using this technique Kaguya can materialize an immense amount of chakra and use them to form massive chakra fists.\n\nThe technique is so strong that it causes rippling shock waves and can even destroy a full-body Susanoo with relative ease. It is also capable of destroying, a complete Six Paths Chakra Body\n\nAll-killing Ash bones\n\n-An absolute devastating power that she has. The ash killing bones will be produced from her palms. This attack is very lethal as it was seen to disintegerate the person into debris.\n\nExpansive Truth-seeking orbs\n\nKaguya managed to build up collosal amount of chakra and combine them together creating this devastating jutsu. This jutsu are composed of Ying-Yang Release, as well as each of the five nature transformations, this huge ball of chaos was intended by Kaguya to be used as a means to obliterate the world into nothing, only to perish them and get vengeance.\n\nWe can assume her raw chakra by seeing how enormous is the truth-seeking orb\n\nAmenominaka\n\nAmenominaka is a power that allows Kaguya Otsutsuki to create new dimensions on the fly and teleport herself, as well as anything or anyone else along with her to that dimension.\n\nHaving complete control over the individual elements in these created dimensions will surely make her a hard oppenent to defeat. once trapped in one it is very hard to escape these dimensions and return to the real world unless someone managed to forced kaguya to bring him/her back or with the help of rift jutsu. The anime only shows six dimensions, but Kaguya can definitely create more if she desires. The disadvantage is that she could not detect the location of the person in her dimensions but she could sense their chakra so it should help her searching them.",

So that is also not an argument.\nGedo mazo is also something Obito learnt in mere hours. So again I don't see what Nagato did so much better. Madara has no use for the gedo mazo as his susanoo is superior in every way, by a mile. So why the fuvk would he use it?",

The rinnegan was hard for him to use because it want his and he has low chakra reserves compared to Nagato. But wtf do you mean he want adept with it. He used the six paths. He had 6 Jinchuuriki with him you numbskull. Gedo mazo can't one shot anyone where tf do you get that random ass assumption. And Obito summoned the entire thing during the war arc.

You said the others are just better because they're stronger and how that doesn't count but now you use the fact that Nagato literally just has more chakra than Obito by default as a testament to nagatos skill? Nagato literally only could use the 2 rinnegan was because of his immense chakra reserve he got because he's an Uzumaki. If Obito was an Uzumaki hed also be able to use 2.\n\nAlso the ability you meant is a one time thing. It literally crippled Nagato after he used it and drained all of his life force. Why would Obito cripple himself when he was only using gedo mazo as a distraction???? You must have been doing something else than watching Naruto cuz u don't know shit about it",

Also when was it stated that the members received any of that chakra?\n\n>And yet Obito said nothing about needing time to master the rinnegan. If you're going to be retarded why double down on it \n\n\nAre You braindead? You literally need time to learn the abilities. If Nagato is so good, how come he only found out how to use the abilities as a late teen? Obito learnt multiple in a day. That's far more impressive.\n\n> Of course he's not that great at it he wasn't born into the clan of asspulls\n\nThis is the funniest part.\n\nHow did it go from \"Nagato is the best Rinnegan user\" to \"of course he's not that great..\" \n\nI consider this debate a victory.

Why the chakra fruit planted on earth has a collosal amount of chakra?\n\nA chakra fruit fully grows into a fruit every 1000\u20132000 years so we can assume that isshiki and kaguya lived on earth for millenniums. The chakra fruit absorbs chakra from the soil that is filled with blood and deaths of living things. The chakra in the fruit rapidly increases when the planet there is filled with wars and deaths meaning that humans fought each other despite that they are fighting their own kind hence since humans on earth wage wars and filled with brutal souls, the chakra fruit then increases in terms of chakra levels. Now, Kaguya consumed the significant and special chakra fruit making her the strongest and vicious on earth but somehow other otsutsuki are claimed to be better than her well I\u2019ll try to convince you all that kaguya is the strongest otsutsuki.\n\nMost of us have seen the fight between kaguya and team 7 and they annihilated her by putting their hands on her armpit. If I said so, why am I here trying to convince you all? because most of you guys watching naruto didnt think OUTSIDE THE BOX. Now, one of the reason kaguya got annihilated was because she was careless and got unlucky. Another reason is that she just got unsealed. What do I mean by that? If we calculate the time she has been, it will definitely be damn long Approximately 6000\u20139000 years No cap. Why has being sealed for a long period of time related to any of this? I\u2019ll give you an analogy,Guns -ak-47 LMG RPG any of those destructive weapons and compared it to the future ones for sure the future guns will be more destructive as Technology develops. Thus we must thoroughly comprehend the fact that kaguya has a disadvantage(being sealed) and outdated. So if kaguya wasn\u2019t sealed, she would have develop disastrous ninjitsu that cant be absorbed and difficult to dodge. Even if so she was just unsealed after thousand of years, she would be stronger than Isshiki because she didnt use all her abilities such as using the godly strength from the ten tailed beast. Kaguya did not have the final form of the ten tailed beast as chakra from the it was extracted and divided to tailed beasts. Another reason why Kaguya did not killed Naruto and Sasuke was because she wanted to drain their chakra.\n\n\nNaruto and Sasuke were basically sharing Kaguya's power. Every being in the world had Kaguya's chakra. She wanted to extract the chakra from Sasuke and Naruto as they possessed Collosal amount if chakra.\n\n\nAnd the most Proficient sealing jutsu on their palm\n\n\nShe also needed to be careful because if they were to put their palm on Kaguya,she would be sealed for eternity again. Unlike during Isshiki fight, he did not need to worry so much that would end his career. She would have annihilated them with ease. I mean like Kaguya had many oppurturnities to destroy them but she choose not to. Another huge factor is that she was old. She hasnt changed to another new vessel and her age is ten and thousands of years old. Despite being an alien species(techinically immortal) they are still living thing so they could die. What grants them immortality is due to the fact that once they changed their vessel they reborn.\n\nHere is the abilities of Kaguya\n\nDivine powers\n-interstellar travel, hypnosis, mind-reading abilities, memory-wipe, and creation of force fields and shock waves.\n\nDojutsus and kekkei genkai\n\n-Kaguya has access to the Byakugan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder with unparalleled vision, chakra detection, and aim; the Sharingan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder to create and deflect illusions, copy techniques of other ninjas, detect chakras and traps and eventually activate the Mangekyo Sharingan; as well as the Rinnegan, a Dojutsu that provides the wielder with godly powers of summoning creatures, controlling gravity, ripping souls, reading minds, killing people, resurrecting people, opening portals, creating phantom clones, and absorbing chakra amongst others.\n\nRinne Sharingan\n\n-Allows kaguya to cast infinite tsuyokomi and potentially to wipe out chakra from others, creation of portals and especially utilizing the god tree.\n\nEighty gods vaccum Attack\n\n-Eighty God Vacuum Attack, born out of her immense control over chakra. This powerful and pervalent jutsu allows Kaguya to wield chakra in both a defensive and offensive manner. Using this technique Kaguya can materialize an immense amount of chakra and use them to form massive chakra fists.\n\nThe technique is so strong that it causes rippling shock waves and can even destroy a full-body Susanoo with relative ease. It is also capable of destroying, a complete Six Paths Chakra Body\n\nAll-killing Ash bones\n\n-An absolute devastating power that she has. The ash killing bones will be produced from her palms. This attack is very lethal as it was seen to disintegerate the person into debris.\n\nExpansive Truth-seeking orbs\n\nKaguya managed to build up collosal amount of chakra and combine them together creating this devastating jutsu. This jutsu are composed of Ying-Yang Release, as well as each of the five nature transformations, this huge ball of chaos was intended by Kaguya to be used as a means to obliterate the world into nothing, only to perish them and get vengeance.\n\nWe can assume her raw chakra by seeing how enormous is the truth-seeking orb\n\nAmenominaka\n\nAmenominaka is a power that allows Kaguya Otsutsuki to create new dimensions on the fly and teleport herself, as well as anything or anyone else along with her to that dimension.\n\nHaving complete control over the individual elements in these created dimensions will surely make her a hard oppenent to defeat. once trapped in one it is very hard to escape these dimensions and return to the real world unless someone managed to forced kaguya to bring him/her back or with the help of rift jutsu. The anime only shows six dimensions, but Kaguya can definitely create more if she desires. The disadvantage is that she could not detect the location of the person in her dimensions but she could sense their chakra so it should help her searching them.",

You're saying he did 1  minor thing out of all the abilities it has when Obito said he'd lose himself using it to its fullest extent. You mean taking people's souls isn't a 1 shot option ?

You said the others are just better because they're stronger and how that doesn't count but now you use the fact that Nagato literally just has more chakra than Obito by default as a testament to nagatos skill? Nagato literally only could use the 2 rinnegan was because of his immense chakra reserve he got because he's an Uzumaki. If Obito was an Uzumaki hed also be able to use 2.\n\nAlso the ability you meant is a one time thing. It literally crippled Nagato after he used it and drained all of his life force. Why would Obito cripple himself when he was only using gedo mazo as a distraction???? You must have been doing something else than watching Naruto cuz u don't know shit about it",

Did you even watch the war arc climax?\n\nObito didn't need to use any of pains abilities...? Why tf should he use the gedo mazo thing on random Shinobi that aren't even a threat to him. He used the gedo mazo as a distraction so he could get the sages items and that worked. Infact everything except for Kabuto edoing Madara was going pretty much according to Obitos plan. Madara was revived they summoned the 10 tails, he temporarily became the juubis shell. And then Madaras plan took over. When in these instances would he have needed to use shinra tensei or some shit?",

Don't make me laugh\n\nNagato had his rinnegan for 30 or so years and Obito for 2 days after which he already managed to use the six paths which you claimed to be the magnum opus of the rinnegan at the beginning of this ridiculous debate. He also managed to use the gedo mazo instantly in full form. \n\nAs I've said multiple times so far, Madara used multiple abilities after mere minutes of having his rinnegan and instantly surpassed Nagato in it's uses. Including perfectly using the outer path which you conveniently seem to ignore as a feat so far. \nSasuke too instantly mastered his personal rinnegan use, pull and push, shibaku tensei and most importantly a genjutsu so strong he captured ALL 9 tailed beasts at once, meanwhile pain sucks ass at genjutsu.",

Why the chakra fruit planted on earth has a collosal amount of chakra?\n\nA chakra fruit fully grows into a fruit every 1000\u20132000 years so we can assume that isshiki and kaguya lived on earth for millenniums. The chakra fruit absorbs chakra from the soil that is filled with blood and deaths of living things. The chakra in the fruit rapidly increases when the planet there is filled with wars and deaths meaning that humans fought each other despite that they are fighting their own kind hence since humans on earth wage wars and filled with brutal souls, the chakra fruit then increases in terms of chakra levels. Now, Kaguya consumed the significant and special chakra fruit making her the strongest and vicious on earth but somehow other otsutsuki are claimed to be better than her well I\u2019ll try to convince you all that kaguya is the strongest otsutsuki.\n\nMost of us have seen the fight between kaguya and team 7 and they annihilated her by putting their hands on her armpit. If I said so, why am I here trying to convince you all? because most of you guys watching naruto didnt think OUTSIDE THE BOX. Now, one of the reason kaguya got annihilated was because she was careless and got unlucky. Another reason is that she just got unsealed. What do I mean by that? If we calculate the time she has been, it will definitely be damn long Approximately 6000\u20139000 years No cap. Why has being sealed for a long period of time related to any of this? I\u2019ll give you an analogy,Guns -ak-47 LMG RPG any of those destructive weapons and compared it to the future ones for sure the future guns will be more destructive as Technology develops. Thus we must thoroughly comprehend the fact that kaguya has a disadvantage(being sealed) and outdated. So if kaguya wasn\u2019t sealed, she would have develop disastrous ninjitsu that cant be absorbed and difficult to dodge. Even if so she was just unsealed after thousand of years, she would be stronger than Isshiki because she didnt use all her abilities such as using the godly strength from the ten tailed beast. Kaguya did not have the final form of the ten tailed beast as chakra from the it was extracted and divided to tailed beasts. Another reason why Kaguya did not killed Naruto and Sasuke was because she wanted to drain their chakra.\n\n\nNaruto and Sasuke were basically sharing Kaguya's power. Every being in the world had Kaguya's chakra. She wanted to extract the chakra from Sasuke and Naruto as they possessed Collosal amount if chakra.\n\n\nAnd the most Proficient sealing jutsu on their palm\n\n\nShe also needed to be careful because if they were to put their palm on Kaguya,she would be sealed for eternity again. Unlike during Isshiki fight, he did not need to worry so much that would end his career. She would have annihilated them with ease. I mean like Kaguya had many oppurturnities to destroy them but she choose not to. Another huge factor is that she was old. She hasnt changed to another new vessel and her age is ten and thousands of years old. Despite being an alien species(techinically immortal) they are still living thing so they could die. What grants them immortality is due to the fact that once they changed their vessel they reborn.\n\nHere is the abilities of Kaguya\n\nDivine powers\n-interstellar travel, hypnosis, mind-reading abilities, memory-wipe, and creation of force fields and shock waves.\n\nDojutsus and kekkei genkai\n\n-Kaguya has access to the Byakugan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder with unparalleled vision, chakra detection, and aim; the Sharingan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder to create and deflect illusions, copy techniques of other ninjas, detect chakras and traps and eventually activate the Mangekyo Sharingan; as well as the Rinnegan, a Dojutsu that provides the wielder with godly powers of summoning creatures, controlling gravity, ripping souls, reading minds, killing people, resurrecting people, opening portals, creating phantom clones, and absorbing chakra amongst others.\n\nRinne Sharingan\n\n-Allows kaguya to cast infinite tsuyokomi and potentially to wipe out chakra from others, creation of portals and especially utilizing the god tree.\n\nEighty gods vaccum Attack\n\n-Eighty God Vacuum Attack, born out of her immense control over chakra. This powerful and pervalent jutsu allows Kaguya to wield chakra in both a defensive and offensive manner. Using this technique Kaguya can materialize an immense amount of chakra and use them to form massive chakra fists.\n\nThe technique is so strong that it causes rippling shock waves and can even destroy a full-body Susanoo with relative ease. It is also capable of destroying, a complete Six Paths Chakra Body\n\nAll-killing Ash bones\n\n-An absolute devastating power that she has. The ash killing bones will be produced from her palms. This attack is very lethal as it was seen to disintegerate the person into debris.\n\nExpansive Truth-seeking orbs\n\nKaguya managed to build up collosal amount of chakra and combine them together creating this devastating jutsu. This jutsu are composed of Ying-Yang Release, as well as each of the five nature transformations, this huge ball of chaos was intended by Kaguya to be used as a means to obliterate the world into nothing, only to perish them and get vengeance.\n\nWe can assume her raw chakra by seeing how enormous is the truth-seeking orb\n\nAmenominaka\n\nAmenominaka is a power that allows Kaguya Otsutsuki to create new dimensions on the fly and teleport herself, as well as anything or anyone else along with her to that dimension.\n\nHaving complete control over the individual elements in these created dimensions will surely make her a hard oppenent to defeat. once trapped in one it is very hard to escape these dimensions and return to the real world unless someone managed to forced kaguya to bring him/her back or with the help of rift jutsu. The anime only shows six dimensions, but Kaguya can definitely create more if she desires. The disadvantage is that she could not detect the location of the person in her dimensions but she could sense their chakra so it should help her searching them.",

I mustve watched another fight them. Obito summoned it and didn't do shit with it not the same",

You said the others are just better because they're stronger and how that doesn't count but now you use the fact that Nagato literally just has more chakra than Obito by default as a testament to nagatos skill? Nagato literally only could use the 2 rinnegan was because of his immense chakra reserve he got because he's an Uzumaki. If Obito was an Uzumaki hed also be able to use 2.\n\nAlso the ability you meant is a one time thing. It literally crippled Nagato after he used it and drained all of his life force. Why would Obito cripple himself when he was only using gedo mazo as a distraction???? You must have been doing something else than watching Naruto cuz u don't know shit about it",

                                                                                    "body": "I have a life but here you go\n\nFirst of all, we need to know that Kaguya ate a chakra fruit that has the most vast amount of chakra known in naruto. Why the chakra fruit planted on earth has a collosal amount of chakra?\n\nA chakra fruit fully grows into a fruit every 1000\u20132000 years so we can assume that isshiki and kaguya lived on earth for millenniums. The chakra fruit absorbs chakra from the soil that is filled with blood and deaths of living things. The chakra in the fruit rapidly increases when the planet there is filled with wars and deaths meaning that humans fought each other despite that they are fighting their own kind hence since humans on earth wage wars and filled with brutal souls, the chakra fruit then increases in terms of chakra levels. Now, Kaguya consumed the significant and special chakra fruit making her the strongest and vicious on earth but somehow other otsutsuki are claimed to be better than her well I\u2019ll try to convince you all that kaguya is the strongest otsutsuki.\n\nMost of us have seen the fight between kaguya and team 7 and they annihilated her by putting their hands on her armpit. If I said so, why am I here trying to convince you all? because most of you guys watching naruto didnt think OUTSIDE THE BOX. Now, one of the reason kaguya got annihilated was because she was careless and got unlucky. Another reason is that she just got unsealed. What do I mean by that? If we calculate the time she has been, it will definitely be damn long Approximately 6000\u20139000 years No cap. Why has being sealed for a long period of time related to any of this? I\u2019ll give you an analogy,Guns -ak-47 LMG RPG any of those destructive weapons and compared it to the future ones for sure the future guns will be more destructive as Technology develops. Thus we must thoroughly comprehend the fact that kaguya has a disadvantage(being sealed) and outdated. So if kaguya wasn\u2019t sealed, she would have develop disastrous ninjitsu that cant be absorbed and difficult to dodge. Even if so she was just unsealed after thousand of years, she would be stronger than Isshiki because she didnt use all her abilities such as using the godly strength from the ten tailed beast. Kaguya did not have the final form of the ten tailed beast as chakra from the it was extracted and divided to tailed beasts. Another reason why Kaguya did not killed Naruto and Sasuke was because she wanted to drain their chakra.\n\n\nNaruto and Sasuke were basically sharing Kaguya's power. Every being in the world had Kaguya's chakra. She wanted to extract the chakra from Sasuke and Naruto as they possessed Collosal amount if chakra.\n\n\nAnd the most Proficient sealing jutsu on their palm\n\n\nShe also needed to be careful because if they were to put their palm on Kaguya,she would be sealed for eternity again. Unlike during Isshiki fight, he did not need to worry so much that would end his career. She would have annihilated them with ease. I mean like Kaguya had many oppurturnities to destroy them but she choose not to. Another huge factor is that she was old. She hasnt changed to another new vessel and her age is ten and thousands of years old. Despite being an alien species(techinically immortal) they are still living thing so they could die. What grants them immortality is due to the fact that once they changed their vessel they reborn.\n\nHere is the abilities of Kaguya\n\nDivine powers\n-interstellar travel, hypnosis, mind-reading abilities, memory-wipe, and creation of force fields and shock waves.\n\nDojutsus and kekkei genkai\n\n-Kaguya has access to the Byakugan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder with unparalleled vision, chakra detection, and aim; the Sharingan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder to create and deflect illusions, copy techniques of other ninjas, detect chakras and traps and eventually activate the Mangekyo Sharingan; as well as the Rinnegan, a Dojutsu that provides the wielder with godly powers of summoning creatures, controlling gravity, ripping souls, reading minds, killing people, resurrecting people, opening portals, creating phantom clones, and absorbing chakra amongst others.\n\nRinne Sharingan\n\n-Allows kaguya to cast infinite tsuyokomi and potentially to wipe out chakra from others, creation of portals and especially utilizing the god tree.\n\nEighty gods vaccum Attack\n\n-Eighty God Vacuum Attack, born out of her immense control over chakra. This powerful and pervalent jutsu allows Kaguya to wield chakra in both a defensive and offensive manner. Using this technique Kaguya can materialize an immense amount of chakra and use them to form massive chakra fists.\n\nThe technique is so strong that it causes rippling shock waves and can even destroy a full-body Susanoo with relative ease. It is also capable of destroying, a complete Six Paths Chakra Body\n\nAll-killing Ash bones\n\n-An absolute devastating power that she has. The ash killing bones will be produced from her palms. This attack is very lethal as it was seen to disintegerate the person into debris.\n\nExpansive Truth-seeking orbs\n\nKaguya managed to build up collosal amount of chakra and combine them together creating this devastating jutsu. This jutsu are composed of Ying-Yang Release, as well as each of the five nature transformations, this huge ball of chaos was intended by Kaguya to be used as a means to obliterate the world into nothing, only to perish them and get vengeance.\n\nWe can assume her raw chakra by seeing how enormous is the truth-seeking orb\n\nAmenominaka\n\nAmenominaka is a power that allows Kaguya Otsutsuki to create new dimensions on the fly and teleport herself, as well as anything or anyone else along with her to that dimension.\n\nHaving complete control over the individual elements in these created dimensions will surely make her a hard oppenent to defeat. once trapped in one it is very hard to escape these dimensions and return to the real world unless someone managed to forced kaguya to bring him/her back or with the help of rift jutsu. The anime only shows six dimensions, but Kaguya can definitely create more if she desires. The disadvantage is that she could not detect the location of the person in her dimensions but she could sense their chakra so it should help her searching them.",

You said the others are just better because they're stronger and how that doesn't count but now you use the fact that Nagato literally just has more chakra than Obito by default as a testament to nagatos skill? Nagato literally only could use the 2 rinnegan was because of his immense chakra reserve he got because he's an Uzumaki. If Obito was an Uzumaki hed also be able to use 2.\n\nAlso the ability you meant is a one time thing. It literally crippled Nagato after he used it and drained all of his life force. Why would Obito cripple himself when he was only using gedo mazo as a distraction???? You must have been doing something else than watching Naruto cuz u don't know shit about it",

                                                                            "body": "I have a life but here you go\n\nFirst of all, we need to know that Kaguya ate a chakra fruit that has the most vast amount of chakra known in naruto. Why the chakra fruit planted on earth has a collosal amount of chakra?\n\nA chakra fruit fully grows into a fruit every 1000\u20132000 years so we can assume that isshiki and kaguya lived on earth for millenniums. The chakra fruit absorbs chakra from the soil that is filled with blood and deaths of living things. The chakra in the fruit rapidly increases when the planet there is filled with wars and deaths meaning that humans fought each other despite that they are fighting their own kind hence since humans on earth wage wars and filled with brutal souls, the chakra fruit then increases in terms of chakra levels. Now, Kaguya consumed the significant and special chakra fruit making her the strongest and vicious on earth but somehow other otsutsuki are claimed to be better than her well I\u2019ll try to convince you all that kaguya is the strongest otsutsuki.\n\nMost of us have seen the fight between kaguya and team 7 and they annihilated her by putting their hands on her armpit. If I said so, why am I here trying to convince you all? because most of you guys watching naruto didnt think OUTSIDE THE BOX. Now, one of the reason kaguya got annihilated was because she was careless and got unlucky. Another reason is that she just got unsealed. What do I mean by that? If we calculate the time she has been, it will definitely be damn long Approximately 6000\u20139000 years No cap. Why has being sealed for a long period of time related to any of this? I\u2019ll give you an analogy,Guns -ak-47 LMG RPG any of those destructive weapons and compared it to the future ones for sure the future guns will be more destructive as Technology develops. Thus we must thoroughly comprehend the fact that kaguya has a disadvantage(being sealed) and outdated. So if kaguya wasn\u2019t sealed, she would have develop disastrous ninjitsu that cant be absorbed and difficult to dodge. Even if so she was just unsealed after thousand of years, she would be stronger than Isshiki because she didnt use all her abilities such as using the godly strength from the ten tailed beast. Kaguya did not have the final form of the ten tailed beast as chakra from the it was extracted and divided to tailed beasts. Another reason why Kaguya did not killed Naruto and Sasuke was because she wanted to drain their chakra.\n\n\nNaruto and Sasuke were basically sharing Kaguya's power. Every being in the world had Kaguya's chakra. She wanted to extract the chakra from Sasuke and Naruto as they possessed Collosal amount if chakra.\n\n\nAnd the most Proficient sealing jutsu on their palm\n\n\nShe also needed to be careful because if they were to put their palm on Kaguya,she would be sealed for eternity again. Unlike during Isshiki fight, he did not need to worry so much that would end his career. She would have annihilated them with ease. I mean like Kaguya had many oppurturnities to destroy them but she choose not to. Another huge factor is that she was old. She hasnt changed to another new vessel and her age is ten and thousands of years old. Despite being an alien species(techinically immortal) they are still living thing so they could die. What grants them immortality is due to the fact that once they changed their vessel they reborn.\n\nHere is the abilities of Kaguya\n\nDivine powers\n-interstellar travel, hypnosis, mind-reading abilities, memory-wipe, and creation of force fields and shock waves.\n\nDojutsus and kekkei genkai\n\n-Kaguya has access to the Byakugan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder with unparalleled vision, chakra detection, and aim; the Sharingan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder to create and deflect illusions, copy techniques of other ninjas, detect chakras and traps and eventually activate the Mangekyo Sharingan; as well as the Rinnegan, a Dojutsu that provides the wielder with godly powers of summoning creatures, controlling gravity, ripping souls, reading minds, killing people, resurrecting people, opening portals, creating phantom clones, and absorbing chakra amongst others.\n\nRinne Sharingan\n\n-Allows kaguya to cast infinite tsuyokomi and potentially to wipe out chakra from others, creation of portals and especially utilizing the god tree.\n\nEighty gods vaccum Attack\n\n-Eighty God Vacuum Attack, born out of her immense control over chakra. This powerful and pervalent jutsu allows Kaguya to wield chakra in both a defensive and offensive manner. Using this technique Kaguya can materialize an immense amount of chakra and use them to form massive chakra fists.\n\nThe technique is so strong that it causes rippling shock waves and can even destroy a full-body Susanoo with relative ease. It is also capable of destroying, a complete Six Paths Chakra Body\n\nAll-killing Ash bones\n\n-An absolute devastating power that she has. The ash killing bones will be produced from her palms. This attack is very lethal as it was seen to disintegerate the person into debris.\n\nExpansive Truth-seeking orbs\n\nKaguya managed to build up collosal amount of chakra and combine them together creating this devastating jutsu. This jutsu are composed of Ying-Yang Release, as well as each of the five nature transformations, this huge ball of chaos was intended by Kaguya to be used as a means to obliterate the world into nothing, only to perish them and get vengeance.\n\nWe can assume her raw chakra by seeing how enormous is the truth-seeking orb\n\nAmenominaka\n\nAmenominaka is a power that allows Kaguya Otsutsuki to create new dimensions on the fly and teleport herself, as well as anything or anyone else along with her to that dimension.\n\nHaving complete control over the individual elements in these created dimensions will surely make her a hard oppenent to defeat. once trapped in one it is very hard to escape these dimensions and return to the real world unless someone managed to forced kaguya to bring him/her back or with the help of rift jutsu. The anime only shows six dimensions, but Kaguya can definitely create more if she desires. The disadvantage is that she could not detect the location of the person in her dimensions but she could sense their chakra so it should help her searching them.",

You said the others are just better because they're stronger and how that doesn't count but now you use the fact that Nagato literally just has more chakra than Obito by default as a testament to nagatos skill? Nagato literally only could use the 2 rinnegan was because of his immense chakra reserve he got because he's an Uzumaki. If Obito was an Uzumaki hed also be able to use 2.\n\nAlso the ability you meant is a one time thing. It literally crippled Nagato after he used it and drained all of his life force. Why would Obito cripple himself when he was only using gedo mazo as a distraction???? You must have been doing something else than watching Naruto cuz u don't know shit about it",

He also managed to use the gedo mazo instantly in full form. \n\nAs I've said multiple times so far, Madara used multiple abilities after mere minutes of having his rinnegan and instantly surpassed Nagato in it's uses. Including perfectly using the outer path which you conveniently seem to ignore as a feat so far. \nSasuke too instantly mastered his personal rinnegan use, pull and push, shibaku tensei and most importantly a genjutsu so strong he captured ALL 9 tailed beasts at once, meanwhile pain sucks ass at genjutsu.",

                                                                    "body": "I have a life but here you go\n\nFirst of all, we need to know that Kaguya ate a chakra fruit that has the most vast amount of chakra known in naruto. Why the chakra fruit planted on earth has a collosal amount of chakra?\n\nA chakra fruit fully grows into a fruit every 1000\u20132000 years so we can assume that isshiki and kaguya lived on earth for millenniums. The chakra fruit absorbs chakra from the soil that is filled with blood and deaths of living things. The chakra in the fruit rapidly increases when the planet there is filled with wars and deaths meaning that humans fought each other despite that they are fighting their own kind hence since humans on earth wage wars and filled with brutal souls, the chakra fruit then increases in terms of chakra levels. Now, Kaguya consumed the significant and special chakra fruit making her the strongest and vicious on earth but somehow other otsutsuki are claimed to be better than her well I\u2019ll try to convince you all that kaguya is the strongest otsutsuki.\n\nMost of us have seen the fight between kaguya and team 7 and they annihilated her by putting their hands on her armpit. If I said so, why am I here trying to convince you all? because most of you guys watching naruto didnt think OUTSIDE THE BOX. Now, one of the reason kaguya got annihilated was because she was careless and got unlucky. Another reason is that she just got unsealed. What do I mean by that? If we calculate the time she has been, it will definitely be damn long Approximately 6000\u20139000 years No cap. Why has being sealed for a long period of time related to any of this? I\u2019ll give you an analogy,Guns -ak-47 LMG RPG any of those destructive weapons and compared it to the future ones for sure the future guns will be more destructive as Technology develops. Thus we must thoroughly comprehend the fact that kaguya has a disadvantage(being sealed) and outdated. So if kaguya wasn\u2019t sealed, she would have develop disastrous ninjitsu that cant be absorbed and difficult to dodge. Even if so she was just unsealed after thousand of years, she would be stronger than Isshiki because she didnt use all her abilities such as using the godly strength from the ten tailed beast. Kaguya did not have the final form of the ten tailed beast as chakra from the it was extracted and divided to tailed beasts. Another reason why Kaguya did not killed Naruto and Sasuke was because she wanted to drain their chakra.\n\n\nNaruto and Sasuke were basically sharing Kaguya's power. Every being in the world had Kaguya's chakra. She wanted to extract the chakra from Sasuke and Naruto as they possessed Collosal amount if chakra.\n\n\nAnd the most Proficient sealing jutsu on their palm\n\n\nShe also needed to be careful because if they were to put their palm on Kaguya,she would be sealed for eternity again. Unlike during Isshiki fight, he did not need to worry so much that would end his career. She would have annihilated them with ease. I mean like Kaguya had many oppurturnities to destroy them but she choose not to. Another huge factor is that she was old. She hasnt changed to another new vessel and her age is ten and thousands of years old. Despite being an alien species(techinically immortal) they are still living thing so they could die. What grants them immortality is due to the fact that once they changed their vessel they reborn.\n\nHere is the abilities of Kaguya\n\nDivine powers\n-interstellar travel, hypnosis, mind-reading abilities, memory-wipe, and creation of force fields and shock waves.\n\nDojutsus and kekkei genkai\n\n-Kaguya has access to the Byakugan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder with unparalleled vision, chakra detection, and aim; the Sharingan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder to create and deflect illusions, copy techniques of other ninjas, detect chakras and traps and eventually activate the Mangekyo Sharingan; as well as the Rinnegan, a Dojutsu that provides the wielder with godly powers of summoning creatures, controlling gravity, ripping souls, reading minds, killing people, resurrecting people, opening portals, creating phantom clones, and absorbing chakra amongst others.\n\nRinne Sharingan\n\n-Allows kaguya to cast infinite tsuyokomi and potentially to wipe out chakra from others, creation of portals and especially utilizing the god tree.\n\nEighty gods vaccum Attack\n\n-Eighty God Vacuum Attack, born out of her immense control over chakra. This powerful and pervalent jutsu allows Kaguya to wield chakra in both a defensive and offensive manner. Using this technique Kaguya can materialize an immense amount of chakra and use them to form massive chakra fists.\n\nThe technique is so strong that it causes rippling shock waves and can even destroy a full-body Susanoo with relative ease. It is also capable of destroying, a complete Six Paths Chakra Body\n\nAll-killing Ash bones\n\n-An absolute devastating power that she has. The ash killing bones will be produced from her palms. This attack is very lethal as it was seen to disintegerate the person into debris.\n\nExpansive Truth-seeking orbs\n\nKaguya managed to build up collosal amount of chakra and combine them together creating this devastating jutsu. This jutsu are composed of Ying-Yang Release, as well as each of the five nature transformations, this huge ball of chaos was intended by Kaguya to be used as a means to obliterate the world into nothing, only to perish them and get vengeance.\n\nWe can assume her raw chakra by seeing how enormous is the truth-seeking orb\n\nAmenominaka\n\nAmenominaka is a power that allows Kaguya Otsutsuki to create new dimensions on the fly and teleport herself, as well as anything or anyone else along with her to that dimension.\n\nHaving complete control over the individual elements in these created dimensions will surely make her a hard oppenent to defeat. once trapped in one it is very hard to escape these dimensions and return to the real world unless someone managed to forced kaguya to bring him/her back or with the help of rift jutsu. The anime only shows six dimensions, but Kaguya can definitely create more if she desires. The disadvantage is that she could not detect the location of the person in her dimensions but she could sense their chakra so it should help her searching them.",

He used the gedo mazo as a distraction so he could get the sages items and that worked. Infact everything except for Kabuto edoing Madara was going pretty much according to Obitos plan. Madara was revived they summoned the 10 tails, he temporarily became the juubis shell. And then Madaras plan took over.

He also managed to use the gedo mazo instantly in full form. \n\nAs I've said multiple times so far, Madara used multiple abilities after mere minutes of having his rinnegan and instantly surpassed Nagato in it's uses. Including perfectly using the outer path which you conveniently seem to ignore as a feat so far. \nSasuke too instantly mastered his personal rinnegan use, pull and push, shibaku tensei and most importantly a genjutsu so strong he captured ALL 9 tailed beasts at once, meanwhile pain sucks ass at genjutsu.",

                                                            "body": "I have a life but here you go\n\nFirst of all, we need to know that Kaguya ate a chakra fruit that has the most vast amount of chakra known in naruto. Why the chakra fruit planted on earth has a collosal amount of chakra?\n\nA chakra fruit fully grows into a fruit every 1000\u20132000 years so we can assume that isshiki and kaguya lived on earth for millenniums. The chakra fruit absorbs chakra from the soil that is filled with blood and deaths of living things. The chakra in the fruit rapidly increases when the planet there is filled with wars and deaths meaning that humans fought each other despite that they are fighting their own kind hence since humans on earth wage wars and filled with brutal souls, the chakra fruit then increases in terms of chakra levels. Now, Kaguya consumed the significant and special chakra fruit making her the strongest and vicious on earth but somehow other otsutsuki are claimed to be better than her well I\u2019ll try to convince you all that kaguya is the strongest otsutsuki.\n\nMost of us have seen the fight between kaguya and team 7 and they annihilated her by putting their hands on her armpit. If I said so, why am I here trying to convince you all? because most of you guys watching naruto didnt think OUTSIDE THE BOX. Now, one of the reason kaguya got annihilated was because she was careless and got unlucky. Another reason is that she just got unsealed. What do I mean by that? If we calculate the time she has been, it will definitely be damn long Approximately 6000\u20139000 years No cap. Why has being sealed for a long period of time related to any of this? I\u2019ll give you an analogy,Guns -ak-47 LMG RPG any of those destructive weapons and compared it to the future ones for sure the future guns will be more destructive as Technology develops. Thus we must thoroughly comprehend the fact that kaguya has a disadvantage(being sealed) and outdated. So if kaguya wasn\u2019t sealed, she would have develop disastrous ninjitsu that cant be absorbed and difficult to dodge. Even if so she was just unsealed after thousand of years, she would be stronger than Isshiki because she didnt use all her abilities such as using the godly strength from the ten tailed beast. Kaguya did not have the final form of the ten tailed beast as chakra from the it was extracted and divided to tailed beasts. Another reason why Kaguya did not killed Naruto and Sasuke was because she wanted to drain their chakra.\n\n\nNaruto and Sasuke were basically sharing Kaguya's power. Every being in the world had Kaguya's chakra. She wanted to extract the chakra from Sasuke and Naruto as they possessed Collosal amount if chakra.\n\n\nAnd the most Proficient sealing jutsu on their palm\n\n\nShe also needed to be careful because if they were to put their palm on Kaguya,she would be sealed for eternity again. Unlike during Isshiki fight, he did not need to worry so much that would end his career. She would have annihilated them with ease. I mean like Kaguya had many oppurturnities to destroy them but she choose not to. Another huge factor is that she was old. She hasnt changed to another new vessel and her age is ten and thousands of years old. Despite being an alien species(techinically immortal) they are still living thing so they could die. What grants them immortality is due to the fact that once they changed their vessel they reborn.\n\nHere is the abilities of Kaguya\n\nDivine powers\n-interstellar travel, hypnosis, mind-reading abilities, memory-wipe, and creation of force fields and shock waves.\n\nDojutsus and kekkei genkai\n\n-Kaguya has access to the Byakugan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder with unparalleled vision, chakra detection, and aim; the Sharingan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder to create and deflect illusions, copy techniques of other ninjas, detect chakras and traps and eventually activate the Mangekyo Sharingan; as well as the Rinnegan, a Dojutsu that provides the wielder with godly powers of summoning creatures, controlling gravity, ripping souls, reading minds, killing people, resurrecting people, opening portals, creating phantom clones, and absorbing chakra amongst others.\n\nRinne Sharingan\n\n-Allows kaguya to cast infinite tsuyokomi and potentially to wipe out chakra from others, creation of portals and especially utilizing the god tree.\n\nEighty gods vaccum Attack\n\n-Eighty God Vacuum Attack, born out of her immense control over chakra. This powerful and pervalent jutsu allows Kaguya to wield chakra in both a defensive and offensive manner. Using this technique Kaguya can materialize an immense amount of chakra and use them to form massive chakra fists.\n\nThe technique is so strong that it causes rippling shock waves and can even destroy a full-body Susanoo with relative ease. It is also capable of destroying, a complete Six Paths Chakra Body\n\nAll-killing Ash bones\n\n-An absolute devastating power that she has. The ash killing bones will be produced from her palms. This attack is very lethal as it was seen to disintegerate the person into debris.\n\nExpansive Truth-seeking orbs\n\nKaguya managed to build up collosal amount of chakra and combine them together creating this devastating jutsu. This jutsu are composed of Ying-Yang Release, as well as each of the five nature transformations, this huge ball of chaos was intended by Kaguya to be used as a means to obliterate the world into nothing, only to perish them and get vengeance.\n\nWe can assume her raw chakra by seeing how enormous is the truth-seeking orb\n\nAmenominaka\n\nAmenominaka is a power that allows Kaguya Otsutsuki to create new dimensions on the fly and teleport herself, as well as anything or anyone else along with her to that dimension.\n\nHaving complete control over the individual elements in these created dimensions will surely make her a hard oppenent to defeat. once trapped in one it is very hard to escape these dimensions and return to the real world unless someone managed to forced kaguya to bring him/her back or with the help of rift jutsu. The anime only shows six dimensions, but Kaguya can definitely create more if she desires. The disadvantage is that she could not detect the location of the person in her dimensions but she could sense their chakra so it should help her searching them.",

Obito didn't show that he was more skilled with it pure and simple didn't say anything about chakra. He didn't have to pick the jinchuriki he could've used his own body for rinnegan techniques. You know who was a walking chakra battery ? Fucking Naruto both Pain and Sasuke walked up and took it from him. If you want to say Tenten Is more skilled with the sages chakra weapons than the gold and silver Brothers you go on right ahead \n\nWhat is your point? Obito couldn't be better with the rinnegan because he has no chakra. I literally explained that already, if he had as much as Nagato he'd easily outclass him. What are you getting at?",

Don't make me laugh\n\nNagato had his rinnegan for 30 or so years and Obito for 2 days after which he already managed to use the six paths which you claimed to be the magnum opus of the rinnegan at the beginning of this ridiculous debate. He also managed to use the gedo mazo instantly in full form. \n\nAs I've said multiple times so far, Madara used multiple abilities after mere minutes of having his rinnegan and instantly surpassed Nagato in it's uses. Including perfectly using the outer path which you conveniently seem to ignore as a feat so far. \nSasuke too instantly mastered his personal rinnegan use, pull and push, shibaku tensei and most importantly a genjutsu so strong he captured ALL 9 tailed beasts at once, meanwhile pain sucks ass at genjutsu.",

                                                    "body": "I have a life but here you go\n\nFirst of all, we need to know that Kaguya ate a chakra fruit that has the most vast amount of chakra known in naruto. Why the chakra fruit planted on earth has a collosal amount of chakra?\n\nA chakra fruit fully grows into a fruit every 1000\u20132000 years so we can assume that isshiki and kaguya lived on earth for millenniums. The chakra fruit absorbs chakra from the soil that is filled with blood and deaths of living things. The chakra in the fruit rapidly increases when the planet there is filled with wars and deaths meaning that humans fought each other despite that they are fighting their own kind hence since humans on earth wage wars and filled with brutal souls, the chakra fruit then increases in terms of chakra levels. Now, Kaguya consumed the significant and special chakra fruit making her the strongest and vicious on earth but somehow other otsutsuki are claimed to be better than her well I\u2019ll try to convince you all that kaguya is the strongest otsutsuki.\n\nMost of us have seen the fight between kaguya and team 7 and they annihilated her by putting their hands on her armpit. If I said so, why am I here trying to convince you all? because most of you guys watching naruto didnt think OUTSIDE THE BOX. Now, one of the reason kaguya got annihilated was because she was careless and got unlucky. Another reason is that she just got unsealed. What do I mean by that? If we calculate the time she has been, it will definitely be damn long Approximately 6000\u20139000 years No cap. Why has being sealed for a long period of time related to any of this? I\u2019ll give you an analogy,Guns -ak-47 LMG RPG any of those destructive weapons and compared it to the future ones for sure the future guns will be more destructive as Technology develops. Thus we must thoroughly comprehend the fact that kaguya has a disadvantage(being sealed) and outdated. So if kaguya wasn\u2019t sealed, she would have develop disastrous ninjitsu that cant be absorbed and difficult to dodge. Even if so she was just unsealed after thousand of years, she would be stronger than Isshiki because she didnt use all her abilities such as using the godly strength from the ten tailed beast. Kaguya did not have the final form of the ten tailed beast as chakra from the it was extracted and divided to tailed beasts. Another reason why Kaguya did not killed Naruto and Sasuke was because she wanted to drain their chakra.\n\n\nNaruto and Sasuke were basically sharing Kaguya's power. Every being in the world had Kaguya's chakra. She wanted to extract the chakra from Sasuke and Naruto as they possessed Collosal amount if chakra.\n\n\nAnd the most Proficient sealing jutsu on their palm\n\n\nShe also needed to be careful because if they were to put their palm on Kaguya,she would be sealed for eternity again. Unlike during Isshiki fight, he did not need to worry so much that would end his career. She would have annihilated them with ease. I mean like Kaguya had many oppurturnities to destroy them but she choose not to. Another huge factor is that she was old. She hasnt changed to another new vessel and her age is ten and thousands of years old. Despite being an alien species(techinically immortal) they are still living thing so they could die. What grants them immortality is due to the fact that once they changed their vessel they reborn.\n\nHere is the abilities of Kaguya\n\nDivine powers\n-interstellar travel, hypnosis, mind-reading abilities, memory-wipe, and creation of force fields and shock waves.\n\nDojutsus and kekkei genkai\n\n-Kaguya has access to the Byakugan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder with unparalleled vision, chakra detection, and aim; the Sharingan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder to create and deflect illusions, copy techniques of other ninjas, detect chakras and traps and eventually activate the Mangekyo Sharingan; as well as the Rinnegan, a Dojutsu that provides the wielder with godly powers of summoning creatures, controlling gravity, ripping souls, reading minds, killing people, resurrecting people, opening portals, creating phantom clones, and absorbing chakra amongst others.\n\nRinne Sharingan\n\n-Allows kaguya to cast infinite tsuyokomi and potentially to wipe out chakra from others, creation of portals and especially utilizing the god tree.\n\nEighty gods vaccum Attack\n\n-Eighty God Vacuum Attack, born out of her immense control over chakra. This powerful and pervalent jutsu allows Kaguya to wield chakra in both a defensive and offensive manner. Using this technique Kaguya can materialize an immense amount of chakra and use them to form massive chakra fists.\n\nThe technique is so strong that it causes rippling shock waves and can even destroy a full-body Susanoo with relative ease. It is also capable of destroying, a complete Six Paths Chakra Body\n\nAll-killing Ash bones\n\n-An absolute devastating power that she has. The ash killing bones will be produced from her palms. This attack is very lethal as it was seen to disintegerate the person into debris.\n\nExpansive Truth-seeking orbs\n\nKaguya managed to build up collosal amount of chakra and combine them together creating this devastating jutsu. This jutsu are composed of Ying-Yang Release, as well as each of the five nature transformations, this huge ball of chaos was intended by Kaguya to be used as a means to obliterate the world into nothing, only to perish them and get vengeance.\n\nWe can assume her raw chakra by seeing how enormous is the truth-seeking orb\n\nAmenominaka\n\nAmenominaka is a power that allows Kaguya Otsutsuki to create new dimensions on the fly and teleport herself, as well as anything or anyone else along with her to that dimension.\n\nHaving complete control over the individual elements in these created dimensions will surely make her a hard oppenent to defeat. once trapped in one it is very hard to escape these dimensions and return to the real world unless someone managed to forced kaguya to bring him/her back or with the help of rift jutsu. The anime only shows six dimensions, but Kaguya can definitely create more if she desires. The disadvantage is that she could not detect the location of the person in her dimensions but she could sense their chakra so it should help her searching them.",

                                            "body": "I have a life but here you go\n\nFirst of all, we need to know that Kaguya ate a chakra fruit that has the most vast amount of chakra known in naruto. Why the chakra fruit planted on earth has a collosal amount of chakra?\n\nA chakra fruit fully grows into a fruit every 1000\u20132000 years so we can assume that isshiki and kaguya lived on earth for millenniums. The chakra fruit absorbs chakra from the soil that is filled with blood and deaths of living things. The chakra in the fruit rapidly increases when the planet there is filled with wars and deaths meaning that humans fought each other despite that they are fighting their own kind hence since humans on earth wage wars and filled with brutal souls, the chakra fruit then increases in terms of chakra levels. Now, Kaguya consumed the significant and special chakra fruit making her the strongest and vicious on earth but somehow other otsutsuki are claimed to be better than her well I\u2019ll try to convince you all that kaguya is the strongest otsutsuki.\n\nMost of us have seen the fight between kaguya and team 7 and they annihilated her by putting their hands on her armpit. If I said so, why am I here trying to convince you all? because most of you guys watching naruto didnt think OUTSIDE THE BOX. Now, one of the reason kaguya got annihilated was because she was careless and got unlucky. Another reason is that she just got unsealed. What do I mean by that? If we calculate the time she has been, it will definitely be damn long Approximately 6000\u20139000 years No cap. Why has being sealed for a long period of time related to any of this? I\u2019ll give you an analogy,Guns -ak-47 LMG RPG any of those destructive weapons and compared it to the future ones for sure the future guns will be more destructive as Technology develops. Thus we must thoroughly comprehend the fact that kaguya has a disadvantage(being sealed) and outdated. So if kaguya wasn\u2019t sealed, she would have develop disastrous ninjitsu that cant be absorbed and difficult to dodge. Even if so she was just unsealed after thousand of years, she would be stronger than Isshiki because she didnt use all her abilities such as using the godly strength from the ten tailed beast. Kaguya did not have the final form of the ten tailed beast as chakra from the it was extracted and divided to tailed beasts. Another reason why Kaguya did not killed Naruto and Sasuke was because she wanted to drain their chakra.\n\n\nNaruto and Sasuke were basically sharing Kaguya's power. Every being in the world had Kaguya's chakra. She wanted to extract the chakra from Sasuke and Naruto as they possessed Collosal amount if chakra.\n\n\nAnd the most Proficient sealing jutsu on their palm\n\n\nShe also needed to be careful because if they were to put their palm on Kaguya,she would be sealed for eternity again. Unlike during Isshiki fight, he did not need to worry so much that would end his career. She would have annihilated them with ease. I mean like Kaguya had many oppurturnities to destroy them but she choose not to. Another huge factor is that she was old. She hasnt changed to another new vessel and her age is ten and thousands of years old. Despite being an alien species(techinically immortal) they are still living thing so they could die. What grants them immortality is due to the fact that once they changed their vessel they reborn.\n\nHere is the abilities of Kaguya\n\nDivine powers\n-interstellar travel, hypnosis, mind-reading abilities, memory-wipe, and creation of force fields and shock waves.\n\nDojutsus and kekkei genkai\n\n-Kaguya has access to the Byakugan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder with unparalleled vision, chakra detection, and aim; the Sharingan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder to create and deflect illusions, copy techniques of other ninjas, detect chakras and traps and eventually activate the Mangekyo Sharingan; as well as the Rinnegan, a Dojutsu that provides the wielder with godly powers of summoning creatures, controlling gravity, ripping souls, reading minds, killing people, resurrecting people, opening portals, creating phantom clones, and absorbing chakra amongst others.\n\nRinne Sharingan\n\n-Allows kaguya to cast infinite tsuyokomi and potentially to wipe out chakra from others, creation of portals and especially utilizing the god tree.\n\nEighty gods vaccum Attack\n\n-Eighty God Vacuum Attack, born out of her immense control over chakra. This powerful and pervalent jutsu allows Kaguya to wield chakra in both a defensive and offensive manner. Using this technique Kaguya can materialize an immense amount of chakra and use them to form massive chakra fists.\n\nThe technique is so strong that it causes rippling shock waves and can even destroy a full-body Susanoo with relative ease. It is also capable of destroying, a complete Six Paths Chakra Body\n\nAll-killing Ash bones\n\n-An absolute devastating power that she has. The ash killing bones will be produced from her palms. This attack is very lethal as it was seen to disintegerate the person into debris.\n\nExpansive Truth-seeking orbs\n\nKaguya managed to build up collosal amount of chakra and combine them together creating this devastating jutsu. This jutsu are composed of Ying-Yang Release, as well as each of the five nature transformations, this huge ball of chaos was intended by Kaguya to be used as a means to obliterate the world into nothing, only to perish them and get vengeance.\n\nWe can assume her raw chakra by seeing how enormous is the truth-seeking orb\n\nAmenominaka\n\nAmenominaka is a power that allows Kaguya Otsutsuki to create new dimensions on the fly and teleport herself, as well as anything or anyone else along with her to that dimension.\n\nHaving complete control over the individual elements in these created dimensions will surely make her a hard oppenent to defeat. once trapped in one it is very hard to escape these dimensions and return to the real world unless someone managed to forced kaguya to bring him/her back or with the help of rift jutsu. The anime only shows six dimensions, but Kaguya can definitely create more if she desires. The disadvantage is that she could not detect the location of the person in her dimensions but she could sense their chakra so it should help her searching them.",

Don't make me laugh\n\nNagato had his rinnegan for 30 or so years and Obito for 2 days after which he already managed to use the six paths which you claimed to be the magnum opus of the rinnegan at the beginning of this ridiculous debate. He also managed to use the gedo mazo instantly in full form. \n\nAs I've said multiple times so far, Madara used multiple abilities after mere minutes of having his rinnegan and instantly surpassed Nagato in it's uses. Including perfectly using the outer path which you conveniently seem to ignore as a feat so far. \nSasuke too instantly mastered his personal rinnegan use, pull and push, shibaku tensei and most importantly a genjutsu so strong he captured ALL 9 tailed beasts at once, meanwhile pain sucks ass at genjutsu.",

                                    "body": "I have a life but here you go\n\nFirst of all, we need to know that Kaguya ate a chakra fruit that has the most vast amount of chakra known in naruto. Why the chakra fruit planted on earth has a collosal amount of chakra?\n\nA chakra fruit fully grows into a fruit every 1000\u20132000 years so we can assume that isshiki and kaguya lived on earth for millenniums. The chakra fruit absorbs chakra from the soil that is filled with blood and deaths of living things. The chakra in the fruit rapidly increases when the planet there is filled with wars and deaths meaning that humans fought each other despite that they are fighting their own kind hence since humans on earth wage wars and filled with brutal souls, the chakra fruit then increases in terms of chakra levels. Now, Kaguya consumed the significant and special chakra fruit making her the strongest and vicious on earth but somehow other otsutsuki are claimed to be better than her well I\u2019ll try to convince you all that kaguya is the strongest otsutsuki.\n\nMost of us have seen the fight between kaguya and team 7 and they annihilated her by putting their hands on her armpit. If I said so, why am I here trying to convince you all? because most of you guys watching naruto didnt think OUTSIDE THE BOX. Now, one of the reason kaguya got annihilated was because she was careless and got unlucky. Another reason is that she just got unsealed. What do I mean by that? If we calculate the time she has been, it will definitely be damn long Approximately 6000\u20139000 years No cap. Why has being sealed for a long period of time related to any of this? I\u2019ll give you an analogy,Guns -ak-47 LMG RPG any of those destructive weapons and compared it to the future ones for sure the future guns will be more destructive as Technology develops. Thus we must thoroughly comprehend the fact that kaguya has a disadvantage(being sealed) and outdated. So if kaguya wasn\u2019t sealed, she would have develop disastrous ninjitsu that cant be absorbed and difficult to dodge. Even if so she was just unsealed after thousand of years, she would be stronger than Isshiki because she didnt use all her abilities such as using the godly strength from the ten tailed beast. Kaguya did not have the final form of the ten tailed beast as chakra from the it was extracted and divided to tailed beasts. Another reason why Kaguya did not killed Naruto and Sasuke was because she wanted to drain their chakra.\n\n\nNaruto and Sasuke were basically sharing Kaguya's power. Every being in the world had Kaguya's chakra. She wanted to extract the chakra from Sasuke and Naruto as they possessed Collosal amount if chakra.\n\n\nAnd the most Proficient sealing jutsu on their palm\n\n\nShe also needed to be careful because if they were to put their palm on Kaguya,she would be sealed for eternity again. Unlike during Isshiki fight, he did not need to worry so much that would end his career. She would have annihilated them with ease. I mean like Kaguya had many oppurturnities to destroy them but she choose not to. Another huge factor is that she was old. She hasnt changed to another new vessel and her age is ten and thousands of years old. Despite being an alien species(techinically immortal) they are still living thing so they could die. What grants them immortality is due to the fact that once they changed their vessel they reborn.\n\nHere is the abilities of Kaguya\n\nDivine powers\n-interstellar travel, hypnosis, mind-reading abilities, memory-wipe, and creation of force fields and shock waves.\n\nDojutsus and kekkei genkai\n\n-Kaguya has access to the Byakugan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder with unparalleled vision, chakra detection, and aim; the Sharingan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder to create and deflect illusions, copy techniques of other ninjas, detect chakras and traps and eventually activate the Mangekyo Sharingan; as well as the Rinnegan, a Dojutsu that provides the wielder with godly powers of summoning creatures, controlling gravity, ripping souls, reading minds, killing people, resurrecting people, opening portals, creating phantom clones, and absorbing chakra amongst others.\n\nRinne Sharingan\n\n-Allows kaguya to cast infinite tsuyokomi and potentially to wipe out chakra from others, creation of portals and especially utilizing the god tree.\n\nEighty gods vaccum Attack\n\n-Eighty God Vacuum Attack, born out of her immense control over chakra. This powerful and pervalent jutsu allows Kaguya to wield chakra in both a defensive and offensive manner. Using this technique Kaguya can materialize an immense amount of chakra and use them to form massive chakra fists.\n\nThe technique is so strong that it causes rippling shock waves and can even destroy a full-body Susanoo with relative ease. It is also capable of destroying, a complete Six Paths Chakra Body\n\nAll-killing Ash bones\n\n-An absolute devastating power that she has. The ash killing bones will be produced from her palms. This attack is very lethal as it was seen to disintegerate the person into debris.\n\nExpansive Truth-seeking orbs\n\nKaguya managed to build up collosal amount of chakra and combine them together creating this devastating jutsu. This jutsu are composed of Ying-Yang Release, as well as each of the five nature transformations, this huge ball of chaos was intended by Kaguya to be used as a means to obliterate the world into nothing, only to perish them and get vengeance.\n\nWe can assume her raw chakra by seeing how enormous is the truth-seeking orb\n\nAmenominaka\n\nAmenominaka is a power that allows Kaguya Otsutsuki to create new dimensions on the fly and teleport herself, as well as anything or anyone else along with her to that dimension.\n\nHaving complete control over the individual elements in these created dimensions will surely make her a hard oppenent to defeat. once trapped in one it is very hard to escape these dimensions and return to the real world unless someone managed to forced kaguya to bring him/her back or with the help of rift jutsu. The anime only shows six dimensions, but Kaguya can definitely create more if she desires. The disadvantage is that she could not detect the location of the person in her dimensions but she could sense their chakra so it should help her searching them.",

If Nagato is so good, how come he only found out how to use the abilities as a late teen? Obito learnt multiple in a day. That's far more impressive.\n\n> Of course he's not that great at it he wasn't born into the clan of asspulls\n\nThis is the funniest part.\n\nHow did it go from \"Nagato is the best Rinnegan user\" to \"of course he's not that great..\" \n\nI consider this debate a victory. Congratulations, you played yourself",

                            "body": "I have a life but here you go\n\nFirst of all, we need to know that Kaguya ate a chakra fruit that has the most vast amount of chakra known in naruto. Why the chakra fruit planted on earth has a collosal amount of chakra?\n\nA chakra fruit fully grows into a fruit every 1000\u20132000 years so we can assume that isshiki and kaguya lived on earth for millenniums. The chakra fruit absorbs chakra from the soil that is filled with blood and deaths of living things. The chakra in the fruit rapidly increases when the planet there is filled with wars and deaths meaning that humans fought each other despite that they are fighting their own kind hence since humans on earth wage wars and filled with brutal souls, the chakra fruit then increases in terms of chakra levels. Now, Kaguya consumed the significant and special chakra fruit making her the strongest and vicious on earth but somehow other otsutsuki are claimed to be better than her well I\u2019ll try to convince you all that kaguya is the strongest otsutsuki.\n\nMost of us have seen the fight between kaguya and team 7 and they annihilated her by putting their hands on her armpit. If I said so, why am I here trying to convince you all? because most of you guys watching naruto didnt think OUTSIDE THE BOX. Now, one of the reason kaguya got annihilated was because she was careless and got unlucky. Another reason is that she just got unsealed. What do I mean by that? If we calculate the time she has been, it will definitely be damn long Approximately 6000\u20139000 years No cap. Why has being sealed for a long period of time related to any of this? I\u2019ll give you an analogy,Guns -ak-47 LMG RPG any of those destructive weapons and compared it to the future ones for sure the future guns will be more destructive as Technology develops. Thus we must thoroughly comprehend the fact that kaguya has a disadvantage(being sealed) and outdated. So if kaguya wasn\u2019t sealed, she would have develop disastrous ninjitsu that cant be absorbed and difficult to dodge. Even if so she was just unsealed after thousand of years, she would be stronger than Isshiki because she didnt use all her abilities such as using the godly strength from the ten tailed beast. Kaguya did not have the final form of the ten tailed beast as chakra from the it was extracted and divided to tailed beasts. Another reason why Kaguya did not killed Naruto and Sasuke was because she wanted to drain their chakra.\n\n\nNaruto and Sasuke were basically sharing Kaguya's power. Every being in the world had Kaguya's chakra. She wanted to extract the chakra from Sasuke and Naruto as they possessed Collosal amount if chakra.\n\n\nAnd the most Proficient sealing jutsu on their palm\n\n\nShe also needed to be careful because if they were to put their palm on Kaguya,she would be sealed for eternity again. Unlike during Isshiki fight, he did not need to worry so much that would end his career. She would have annihilated them with ease. I mean like Kaguya had many oppurturnities to destroy them but she choose not to. Another huge factor is that she was old. She hasnt changed to another new vessel and her age is ten and thousands of years old. Despite being an alien species(techinically immortal) they are still living thing so they could die. What grants them immortality is due to the fact that once they changed their vessel they reborn.\n\nHere is the abilities of Kaguya\n\nDivine powers\n-interstellar travel, hypnosis, mind-reading abilities, memory-wipe, and creation of force fields and shock waves.\n\nDojutsus and kekkei genkai\n\n-Kaguya has access to the Byakugan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder with unparalleled vision, chakra detection, and aim; the Sharingan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder to create and deflect illusions, copy techniques of other ninjas, detect chakras and traps and eventually activate the Mangekyo Sharingan; as well as the Rinnegan, a Dojutsu that provides the wielder with godly powers of summoning creatures, controlling gravity, ripping souls, reading minds, killing people, resurrecting people, opening portals, creating phantom clones, and absorbing chakra amongst others.\n\nRinne Sharingan\n\n-Allows kaguya to cast infinite tsuyokomi and potentially to wipe out chakra from others, creation of portals and especially utilizing the god tree.\n\nEighty gods vaccum Attack\n\n-Eighty God Vacuum Attack, born out of her immense control over chakra. This powerful and pervalent jutsu allows Kaguya to wield chakra in both a defensive and offensive manner. Using this technique Kaguya can materialize an immense amount of chakra and use them to form massive chakra fists.\n\nThe technique is so strong that it causes rippling shock waves and can even destroy a full-body Susanoo with relative ease. It is also capable of destroying, a complete Six Paths Chakra Body\n\nAll-killing Ash bones\n\n-An absolute devastating power that she has. The ash killing bones will be produced from her palms. This attack is very lethal as it was seen to disintegerate the person into debris.\n\nExpansive Truth-seeking orbs\n\nKaguya managed to build up collosal amount of chakra and combine them together creating this devastating jutsu. This jutsu are composed of Ying-Yang Release, as well as each of the five nature transformations, this huge ball of chaos was intended by Kaguya to be used as a means to obliterate the world into nothing, only to perish them and get vengeance.\n\nWe can assume her raw chakra by seeing how enormous is the truth-seeking orb\n\nAmenominaka\n\nAmenominaka is a power that allows Kaguya Otsutsuki to create new dimensions on the fly and teleport herself, as well as anything or anyone else along with her to that dimension.\n\nHaving complete control over the individual elements in these created dimensions will surely make her a hard oppenent to defeat. once trapped in one it is very hard to escape these dimensions and return to the real world unless someone managed to forced kaguya to bring him/her back or with the help of rift jutsu. The anime only shows six dimensions, but Kaguya can definitely create more if she desires. The disadvantage is that she could not detect the location of the person in her dimensions but she could sense their chakra so it should help her searching them.",

He also managed to use the gedo mazo instantly in full form. \n\nAs I've said multiple times so far, Madara used multiple abilities after mere minutes of having his rinnegan and instantly surpassed Nagato in it's uses. Including perfectly using the outer path which you conveniently seem to ignore as a feat so far. \nSasuke too instantly mastered his personal rinnegan use, pull and push, shibaku tensei and most importantly a genjutsu so strong he captured ALL 9 tailed beasts at once, meanwhile pain sucks ass at genjutsu.",

                    "body": "I have a life but here you go\n\nFirst of all, we need to know that Kaguya ate a chakra fruit that has the most vast amount of chakra known in naruto. Why the chakra fruit planted on earth has a collosal amount of chakra?\n\nA chakra fruit fully grows into a fruit every 1000\u20132000 years so we can assume that isshiki and kaguya lived on earth for millenniums. The chakra fruit absorbs chakra from the soil that is filled with blood and deaths of living things. The chakra in the fruit rapidly increases when the planet there is filled with wars and deaths meaning that humans fought each other despite that they are fighting their own kind hence since humans on earth wage wars and filled with brutal souls, the chakra fruit then increases in terms of chakra levels. Now, Kaguya consumed the significant and special chakra fruit making her the strongest and vicious on earth but somehow other otsutsuki are claimed to be better than her well I\u2019ll try to convince you all that kaguya is the strongest otsutsuki.\n\nMost of us have seen the fight between kaguya and team 7 and they annihilated her by putting their hands on her armpit. If I said so, why am I here trying to convince you all? because most of you guys watching naruto didnt think OUTSIDE THE BOX. Now, one of the reason kaguya got annihilated was because she was careless and got unlucky. Another reason is that she just got unsealed. What do I mean by that? If we calculate the time she has been, it will definitely be damn long Approximately 6000\u20139000 years No cap. Why has being sealed for a long period of time related to any of this? I\u2019ll give you an analogy,Guns -ak-47 LMG RPG any of those destructive weapons and compared it to the future ones for sure the future guns will be more destructive as Technology develops. Thus we must thoroughly comprehend the fact that kaguya has a disadvantage(being sealed) and outdated. So if kaguya wasn\u2019t sealed, she would have develop disastrous ninjitsu that cant be absorbed and difficult to dodge. Even if so she was just unsealed after thousand of years, she would be stronger than Isshiki because she didnt use all her abilities such as using the godly strength from the ten tailed beast. Kaguya did not have the final form of the ten tailed beast as chakra from the it was extracted and divided to tailed beasts. Another reason why Kaguya did not killed Naruto and Sasuke was because she wanted to drain their chakra.\n\n\nNaruto and Sasuke were basically sharing Kaguya's power. Every being in the world had Kaguya's chakra. She wanted to extract the chakra from Sasuke and Naruto as they possessed Collosal amount if chakra.\n\n\nAnd the most Proficient sealing jutsu on their palm\n\n\nShe also needed to be careful because if they were to put their palm on Kaguya,she would be sealed for eternity again. Unlike during Isshiki fight, he did not need to worry so much that would end his career. She would have annihilated them with ease. I mean like Kaguya had many oppurturnities to destroy them but she choose not to. Another huge factor is that she was old. She hasnt changed to another new vessel and her age is ten and thousands of years old. Despite being an alien species(techinically immortal) they are still living thing so they could die. What grants them immortality is due to the fact that once they changed their vessel they reborn.\n\nHere is the abilities of Kaguya\n\nDivine powers\n-interstellar travel, hypnosis, mind-reading abilities, memory-wipe, and creation of force fields and shock waves.\n\nDojutsus and kekkei genkai\n\n-Kaguya has access to the Byakugan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder with unparalleled vision, chakra detection, and aim; the Sharingan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder to create and deflect illusions, copy techniques of other ninjas, detect chakras and traps and eventually activate the Mangekyo Sharingan; as well as the Rinnegan, a Dojutsu that provides the wielder with godly powers of summoning creatures, controlling gravity, ripping souls, reading minds, killing people, resurrecting people, opening portals, creating phantom clones, and absorbing chakra amongst others.\n\nRinne Sharingan\n\n-Allows kaguya to cast infinite tsuyokomi and potentially to wipe out chakra from others, creation of portals and especially utilizing the god tree.\n\nEighty gods vaccum Attack\n\n-Eighty God Vacuum Attack, born out of her immense control over chakra. This powerful and pervalent jutsu allows Kaguya to wield chakra in both a defensive and offensive manner. Using this technique Kaguya can materialize an immense amount of chakra and use them to form massive chakra fists.\n\nThe technique is so strong that it causes rippling shock waves and can even destroy a full-body Susanoo with relative ease. It is also capable of destroying, a complete Six Paths Chakra Body\n\nAll-killing Ash bones\n\n-An absolute devastating power that she has. The ash killing bones will be produced from her palms. This attack is very lethal as it was seen to disintegerate the person into debris.\n\nExpansive Truth-seeking orbs\n\nKaguya managed to build up collosal amount of chakra and combine them together creating this devastating jutsu. This jutsu are composed of Ying-Yang Release, as well as each of the five nature transformations, this huge ball of chaos was intended by Kaguya to be used as a means to obliterate the world into nothing, only to perish them and get vengeance.\n\nWe can assume her raw chakra by seeing how enormous is the truth-seeking orb\n\nAmenominaka\n\nAmenominaka is a power that allows Kaguya Otsutsuki to create new dimensions on the fly and teleport herself, as well as anything or anyone else along with her to that dimension.\n\nHaving complete control over the individual elements in these created dimensions will surely make her a hard oppenent to defeat. once trapped in one it is very hard to escape these dimensions and return to the real world unless someone managed to forced kaguya to bring him/her back or with the help of rift jutsu. The anime only shows six dimensions, but Kaguya can definitely create more if she desires. The disadvantage is that she could not detect the location of the person in her dimensions but she could sense their chakra so it should help her searching them.",

He also managed to use the gedo mazo instantly in full form. \n\nAs I've said multiple times so far, Madara used multiple abilities after mere minutes of having his rinnegan and instantly surpassed Nagato in it's uses. Including perfectly using the outer path which you conveniently seem to ignore as a feat so far. \nSasuke too instantly mastered his personal rinnegan use, pull and push, shibaku tensei and most importantly a genjutsu so strong he captured ALL 9 tailed beasts at once, meanwhile pain sucks ass at genjutsu.",

Kaguya did not have the final form of the ten tailed beast as chakra from the it was extracted and divided to tailed beasts. Another reason why Kaguya did not killed Naruto and Sasuke was because she wanted to drain their chakra.\n\n\nNaruto and Sasuke were basically sharing Kaguya's power. Every being in the world had Kaguya's chakra. She wanted to extract the chakra from Sasuke and Naruto as they possessed Collosal amount if chakra.\n\n\nAnd the most Proficient sealing jutsu on their palm\n\n\nShe also needed to be careful because if they were to put their palm on Kaguya,she would be sealed for eternity again. Unlike during Isshiki fight, he did not need to worry so much that would end his career. She would have annihilated them with ease. I mean like Kaguya had many oppurturnities to destroy them but she choose not to. Another huge factor is that she was old. She hasnt changed to another new vessel and her age is ten and thousands of years old. Despite being an alien species(techinically immortal) they are still living thing so they could die. What grants them immortality is due to the fact that once they changed their vessel they reborn.\n\nHere is the abilities of Kaguya\n\nDivine powers\n-interstellar travel, hypnosis, mind-reading abilities, memory-wipe, and creation of force fields and shock waves.\n\nDojutsus and kekkei genkai\n\n-Kaguya has access to the Byakugan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder with unparalleled vision, chakra detection, and aim; the Sharingan, a Dojutsu that allows the wielder to create and deflect illusions, copy techniques of other ninjas, detect chakras and traps and eventually activate the Mangekyo Sharingan; as well as the Rinnegan, a Dojutsu that provides the wielder with godly powers of summoning creatures, controlling gravity, ripping souls, reading minds, killing people, resurrecting people, opening portals, creating phantom clones, and absorbing chakra amongst others.\n\nRinne Sharingan\n\n-Allows kaguya to cast infinite tsuyokomi and potentially to wipe out chakra from others, creation of portals and especially utilizing the god tree.\n\nEighty gods vaccum Attack\n\n-Eighty God Vacuum Attack, born out of her immense control over chakra. This powerful and pervalent jutsu allows Kaguya to wield chakra in both a defensive and offensive manner. Using this technique Kaguya can materialize an immense amount of chakra and use them to form massive chakra fists.\n\nThe technique is so strong that it causes rippling shock waves and can even destroy a full-body Susanoo with relative ease. It is also capable of destroying, a complete Six Paths Chakra Body\n\nAll-killing Ash bones\n\n-An absolute devastating power that she has. The ash killing bones will be produced from her palms. This attack is very lethal as it was seen to disintegerate the person into debris.\n\nExpansive Truth-seeking orbs\n\nKaguya managed to build up collosal amount of chakra and combine them together creating this devastating jutsu. This jutsu are composed of Ying-Yang Release, as well as each of the five nature transformations, this huge ball of chaos was intended by Kaguya to be used as a means to obliterate the world into nothing, only to perish them and get vengeance.\n\nWe can assume her raw chakra by seeing how enormous is the truth-seeking orb\n\nAmenominaka\n\nAmenominaka is a power that allows Kaguya Otsutsuki to create new dimensions on the fly and teleport herself, as well as anything or anyone else along with her to that dimension.\n\nHaving complete control over the individual elements in these created dimensions will surely make her a hard oppenent to defeat. once trapped in one it is very hard to escape these dimensions and return to the real world unless someone managed to forced kaguya to bring him/her back or with the help of rift jutsu. The anime only shows six dimensions, but Kaguya can definitely create more if she desires. The disadvantage is that she could not detect the location of the person in her dimensions but she could sense their chakra so it should help her searching them.",

Don't make me laugh\n\nNagato had his rinnegan for 30 or so years and Obito for 2 days after which he already managed to use the six paths which you claimed to be the magnum opus of the rinnegan at the beginning of this ridiculous debate. He also managed to use the gedo mazo instantly in full form. \n\nAs I've said multiple times so far, Madara used multiple abilities after mere minutes of having his rinnegan and instantly surpassed Nagato in it's uses. Including perfectly using the outer path which you conveniently seem to ignore as a feat so far. \nSasuke too instantly mastered his personal rinnegan use, pull and push, shibaku tensei and most importantly a genjutsu so strong he captured ALL 9 tailed beasts at once, meanwhile pain sucks ass at genjutsu.",

Also when was it stated that the members received any of that chakra?\n\n>And yet Obito said nothing about needing time to master the rinnegan. If you're going to be retarded why double down on it \n\n\nAre You braindead? You literally need time to learn the abilities. If Nagato is so good, how come he only found out how to use the abilities as a late teen? Obito learnt multiple in a day. That's far more impressive.\n\n> Of course he's not that great at it he wasn't born into the clan of asspulls\n\nThis is the funniest part.\n\nHow did it go from \"Nagato is the best Rinnegan user\" to \"of course he's not that great..\" \n\nI consider this debate a victory. Congratulations, you played yourself",
