It caused me to feel more confident and attractive and led me to focus on my style. \n\nI was on my own throughout all of this and I know there is such a lack of knowledge for men with issues like this. My goal is to offer the knowledge I have acquired to you and to help people achieve better style and become more confident in there lives.
