Naruto joining up means he has given up on making friends and becoming Hokage, therefore his mindset would be completely different. He would lack hope. He would either want revenge for the hatered he (and many others) received growing up by \"punishing\" the ninja world or he may go another route by killing off all ninjas and ninja villages not as revenge but because he may believe that ninjas, chakra and ninja villages have caused nothing but worthless death (basically he's Eren Yeager). He would see it as cleansing the world, This second route seems much more plausible. This would be ironic since our Naruto wanted to change the minds of all ninjas with world peace, but Akatuski Naruto wants the complete opposite.\n\nAkatuski Naruto would be so badass. He would kill literally anyone because he really hates the ninja world. I would imagine he may even twist the mind of Kurama by feeding into Kurama's hatered for ninja and then both of them would team up in destroying everything and everyone. Naruto is not a fool. He would not just allow the Akatuski to use him and Kurama for their own goal. He would do a 200 IQ move by letting the Akatuski collect all tailed beasts first, then he would combine them all into himself and become the Ten Tail Jinchuriki for more fire power and that's when he would finally get to eradicate the shinobi world. If Hagaromo appears, he may give Sasuke all of his Six Paths powers (instead of splitting it between Naruto and Sasuke) or he may not give any Six Paths at all and wait for the next reincarnations. I may be getting to deep into fanfic territory, but Akatuski Naruto would probably even be able to twist the minds of Kakashi and Sasuke to get them to also join the Akatuski, or maybe they are the one who stand in his way.\n\n\nThank you for coming to my TED-Talk.",

So if one is already a member that one would not need to be collected as he is already on board. They also don\u2019t need to seal him until they got the other eight anyway so as long as he is left in the dark it could work.\n\nThen surprise twist backstab in the end, put 9 tails in, revive ten tails (assuming alternate Akatsuki even has the same goal as the original of course)",

Yes he does believe he's better than Naruto but Naruto starts off the series as a complete loser. And Sasuke does on occasions recognize Naruto's strength. I mean a seminal moment in their relationship is when Sasuke tells Naruto he wants to fight him the most.\n\nI also think people overlook Sasuke's love for Naruto. I think people often forget how emotionally damaged Itachi made Sasuke. Not only did his big brother (who was his idol) kill his parents and clan, he made him relive that experience hundreds of times over to reaffirm hatred instead of love. Itachi then tells Sasuke that only through hatred he can beat him and for good measure says that the only way to obtain similar power to Itachi is to kill his best friend. Killing Itachi is Sasuke's primary goal and any positive relationship is a sign of weakness. And yet he was willing to throw it away on so many occasions to protect Naruto, something even Orochimaru picks up on. Even when Itachi comes to the village, Sasuke's first priority is Naruto's safety. And when leaving the village he doesn't even consider killing Naruto despite knowing that may be the only way to beat Itachi. It's only when Naruto refuses to let him leave without a fight does he entertain that idea and even then he can't go through with it. I mean one of the first things we hear from Sasuke is him berating Sakura for speaking ill about Naruto being an orphan and this is right after Naruto jumped him for no reason.",

Because as it stand you're putting way more stock in filler than canon.\n\nAlso slight detour but Orochimaru didn't have a happy childhood. He grew up an orphan while developing an unhealthy obsession with immortality which only grew as he saw people close to him die.\n\nAlso the Indra-Ashura conflict can still happen without Sasuke being edgy. I mean in their final battle, Sasuke harbors no ill-will against Naruto. It's a purely ideological battle between power vs cooperation which is what Indra and Ashura were fighting about anyways. And who is to say the conflict has to be a deathmatch. It could very well be a competiton (just like in the Indra-Ashura filler) that Naruto wins and Sasuke could accept Naruto was right and that's that.",

The thought of Orochimaru's experiments made him angry, reminding him of Itachi. He routinely ordered Suigetsu not to kill people when they entered fights. \n\nI don't like saying this because it's usually baseless, but seriously. What manga did you read? What anime did you watch? Naruto was out for YEARS before Sasuke got his Mangekyou, and throughout all of that time Sasuke has been consistent in his character. He needs power to kill Itachi, but Itachi is the only person he wants to kill. If he was a bloodthirsty weirdo like you seem to think then he wouldn't have gone back to the Leaf village at the end of the series.",

I hate Sasuke tbh but his character had a big role in Naruto's growth . Similarly , Naruto's character too had a very big role in Sasuke's growth . I am not saying Sasuke's character has no relevance . I am just saying I never found his character cool . There were way cooler characters than him in Naruto imo including Itachi,Minato,Madara,Kakashi and even Naruto .",

Two if you want to say it\u2019s justified to want to kill all the innocent people in the village because of the acts of three people then you have quite a fucked sense of morality. Like that is literally the elders justification for the uchiha massacre was kill the whole clan over the actions of a few. And if you are taking after Danzo for your moral compass you probably need some introspection. Also yes people see akatsuki naruto as an interesting idea especially if you have him leave pre-jiraiya or even pre-pain because 95%+ of the village still didn\u2019t give a shit about whether he died either than they would lose their tailed beast. Throughout the series we see very close parallels between him and other villains such as gaara and obito",

(Hence why every major villain was a foil to Naruto and why the pain arc actually felt like an ending.) The editor said there needed to be an overall rival, someone \"cool (ikemen)\" so Sasuke was added as a generic antithesis to Naruto. The story after Pain was written because of this addition. Kishimoto heavily implied that a lot of story beats were because of his editor's complaints and it has also been implied that reason a lot of cast members got left out in the latter half of the manga is because some of the ninja kids such as kiba, lee, and neji were originally going to die to the sound 5 and cause the other teams to grow distant but the editor/jump thought a bunch of kids dying wasnt a good idea.

Sure, it\u2019s pretty fucked up, but even Itachi himself (who everyone always regards as being correct) went along with it. So Sasuke wanting to destroy the Lear goes directly against Itachi\u2019s wishes, and the contradiction is pretty jarring. \n\nNaruto was literally discriminated against and abused by the villagers. It wasn\u2019t some plan by the head administration to prevent a war from starting, it was literally the common, non-shinobi people who physically mistreated him when he was a child. Naruto has much more of a legitimate reason to hate the Leaf than Sasuke does.\n\nAlthough I still think Akatsuki Naruto is omega cringe for the most part.",

Not to mention the coup ONLY got planned because the village assumed the Uchiha released the Nine Tails on the village, and NOT because they were assholes who deserved to be killed (AND this was by Obito's design as well). The Uchiha clan is actually VERY sympathetic, but everyone's gotta suck off the Senju despite them causing most of the problems in the series, like:\n\n-Hashirama selling bijuu to rival states.\n-Tobirama creating unnecessary kinjutsu that he doesn't use.\n-Hiruzen being a pushover and letting Danzo run wild.\n\nWith the exception of the Fourth War, most of the conflict in the series is because of a Senju being an idiot. So why do so many people hate the Uchiha clan so much?\n\n(P.s. i know you started off by saying you don't hate Sasuke.",

Therefore, if Itachi is correct, and Sasuke is going against Itachi\u2019s wishes, then it\u2019s understandable that people would be confused as to what the hell the dude\u2019s doing. Specially because even Sasuke constantly sucks Itachi off every chance he gets after the reveal. \n\nSo yeah, you\u2019re right, but the way the story presents itself makes it so that people don\u2019t see it that way.\n\nAlso, Naruto was literally pushed out of places that didn\u2019t want to serve him. It isn\u2019t \u201cmy headcanon\u201d. Sorry if I seemed disrespectful at any point.",

He found his clan to be more precious. All of them are dead, and everyone in Konoha doesn't even know the truth\u2014 that the Uchiha clan are arguably innocent. Why would he just ignore his feelings on this? Also, I would argue that Itachi isn't presented as correct in his choice. That kid is a fucked up robot when he's a child, traumatized and obsessed with peace. It isn't that slaughtering his clan was \"right\". To Itachi, that was the path of least bloodshed. I would not care about this if it was my family versus an asshole state, and I would think most people wouldn't care, either. Not to mention that the Massacre didn't have to happen, but Danzo just wanted it to. Shisui was prepared to use Kotoamatsukami to end the coup without bloodshed at all before Danzo snaked him and stole his eye.\n\nAll of this is bundled with Sasuke unlocking the Mangekyou, which can warp the user with the Curse of Hatred.",

Naruto joining up means he has given up on making friends and becoming Hokage, therefore his mindset would be completely different. He would lack hope. He would either want revenge for the hatered he (and many others) received growing up by \"punishing\" the ninja world or he may go another route by killing off all ninjas and ninja villages not as revenge but because he may believe that ninjas, chakra and ninja villages have caused nothing but worthless death (basically he's Eren Yeager). He would see it as cleansing the world, This second route seems much more plausible. This would be ironic since our Naruto wanted to change the minds of all ninjas with world peace, but Akatuski Naruto wants the complete opposite.\n\nAkatuski Naruto would be so badass. He would kill literally anyone because he really hates the ninja world. I would imagine he may even twist the mind of Kurama by feeding into Kurama's hatered for ninja and then both of them would team up in destroying everything and everyone. Naruto is not a fool. He would not just allow the Akatuski to use him and Kurama for their own goal. He would do a 200 IQ move by letting the Akatuski collect all tailed beasts first, then he would combine them all into himself and become the Ten Tail Jinchuriki for more fire power and that's when he would finally get to eradicate the shinobi world. If Hagaromo appears, he may give Sasuke all of his Six Paths powers (instead of splitting it between Naruto and Sasuke) or he may not give any Six Paths at all and wait for the next reincarnations. I may be getting to deep into fanfic territory, but Akatuski Naruto would probably even be able to twist the minds of Kakashi and Sasuke to get them to also join the Akatuski, or maybe they are the one who stand in his way.\n\n\nThank you for coming to my TED-Talk.",

Yes he does believe he's better than Naruto but Naruto starts off the series as a complete loser. And Sasuke does on occasions recognize Naruto's strength. I mean a seminal moment in their relationship is when Sasuke tells Naruto he wants to fight him the most.\n\nI also think people overlook Sasuke's love for Naruto. I think people often forget how emotionally damaged Itachi made Sasuke. Not only did his big brother (who was his idol) kill his parents and clan, he made him relive that experience hundreds of times over to reaffirm hatred instead of love. Itachi then tells Sasuke that only through hatred he can beat him and for good measure says that the only way to obtain similar power to Itachi is to kill his best friend. Killing Itachi is Sasuke's primary goal and any positive relationship is a sign of weakness. And yet he was willing to throw it away on so many occasions to protect Naruto, something even Orochimaru picks up on. Even when Itachi comes to the village, Sasuke's first priority is Naruto's safety. And when leaving the village he doesn't even consider killing Naruto despite knowing that may be the only way to beat Itachi. It's only when Naruto refuses to let him leave without a fight does he entertain that idea and even then he can't go through with it. I mean one of the first things we hear from Sasuke is him berating Sakura for speaking ill about Naruto being an orphan and this is right after Naruto jumped him for no reason.",

In fact Sasuke's first reaction to Naruto beating Gaara, is a resolve to train harder, it's only with Itachi's appearance and Itachi displaying more interest in Naruto than him do we see Sasuke's jealousy start to take a very unhealthy turn.",

Because as it stand you're putting way more stock in filler than canon.\n\nAlso slight detour but Orochimaru didn't have a happy childhood. He grew up an orphan while developing an unhealthy obsession with immortality which only grew as he saw people close to him die.\n\nAlso the Indra-Ashura conflict can still happen without Sasuke being edgy. I mean in their final battle, Sasuke harbors no ill-will against Naruto. It's a purely ideological battle between power vs cooperation which is what Indra and Ashura were fighting about anyways. And who is to say the conflict has to be a deathmatch. It could very well be a competiton (just like in the Indra-Ashura filler) that Naruto wins and Sasuke could accept Naruto was right and that's that.",

The thought of Orochimaru's experiments made him angry, reminding him of Itachi. He routinely ordered Suigetsu not to kill people when they entered fights. \n\nI don't like saying this because it's usually baseless, but seriously. What manga did you read? What anime did you watch? Naruto was out for YEARS before Sasuke got his Mangekyou, and throughout all of that time Sasuke has been consistent in his character. He needs power to kill Itachi, but Itachi is the only person he wants to kill. If he was a bloodthirsty weirdo like you seem to think then he wouldn't have gone back to the Leaf village at the end of the series.",

If Naruto or Kakashi was being spoken on, they'd be praised, despite going through less (or in Kakashi's case, simply different). Uchiha simply can't win in this fandom\n\nAlso the Uchiha Clan is definitely innocent. They're a founding clan that was pushed literally into a corner of their village.

REFUSED TO KILL RANDOM MOOKS UNTIL HE LEARNED THE TRUTH ABOUT ITACHI.\n\nAlso he barely talks in the Blank Period and beyond and is less expressive than he was in Shippuden. Is his sheer proximity irritating you at that point? Why do people feel the need to hate the guy that their favorite character only cares about saving? You say you love Naruto Uzumaki but he's not going to be happy hearing someone calling Sasuke any of that. That's his closest friend.",

After the rewrites Narutos major story beats were written with the villains being Naruto's rival and with the pain arc being the climax. (Hence why every major villain was a foil to Naruto and why the pain arc actually felt like an ending.) The editor said there needed to be an overall rival, someone \"cool (ikemen)\" so Sasuke was added as a generic antithesis to Naruto. The story after Pain was written because of this addition. Kishimoto heavily implied that a lot of story beats were because of his editor's complaints and it has also been implied that reason a lot of cast members got left out in the latter half of the manga is because some of the ninja kids such as kiba, lee, and neji were originally going to die to the sound 5 and cause the other teams to grow distant but the editor/jump thought a bunch of kids dying wasnt a good idea. If you only like Naruto because it's a ninja story then you only really like pretimeskip because after that the ninja aspect takes a back burner.",

Like I said, it was initially a manga about food because in college kishimoto liked eating ramen at ichiraku. Honestly though shokugeki no Soma would have probably been better if it was shokugeki no naruto",

I would not care about this if it was my family versus an asshole state, and I would think most people wouldn't care, either.

I mean in their final battle, Sasuke harbors no ill-will against Naruto. It's a purely ideological battle between power vs cooperation which is what Indra and Ashura were fighting about anyways. And who is to say the conflict has to be a deathmatch. It could very well be a competiton (just like in the Indra-Ashura filler) that Naruto wins and Sasuke could accept Naruto was right and that's that.",

The thought of Orochimaru's experiments made him angry, reminding him of Itachi. He routinely ordered Suigetsu not to kill people when they entered fights. \n\nI don't like saying this because it's usually baseless, but seriously. What manga did you read? What anime did you watch? Naruto was out for YEARS before Sasuke got his Mangekyou, and throughout all of that time Sasuke has been consistent in his character. He needs power to kill Itachi, but Itachi is the only person he wants to kill. If he was a bloodthirsty weirdo like you seem to think then he wouldn't have gone back to the Leaf village at the end of the series.",

If Naruto or Kakashi was being spoken on, they'd be praised, despite going through less (or in Kakashi's case, simply different). Uchiha simply can't win in this fandom\n\nAlso the Uchiha Clan is definitely innocent. They're a founding clan that was pushed literally into a corner of their village. Why would they just nod along with the treatment they received? \n\nIf the Uzumaki clan was being marginalized people would cry bloody murder",

After the rewrites Narutos major story beats were written with the villains being Naruto's rival and with the pain arc being the climax. (Hence why every major villain was a foil to Naruto and why the pain arc actually felt like an ending.) The editor said there needed to be an overall rival, someone \"cool (ikemen)\" so Sasuke was added as a generic antithesis to Naruto. The story after Pain was written because of this addition. Kishimoto heavily implied that a lot of story beats were because of his editor's complaints and it has also been implied that reason a lot of cast members got left out in the latter half of the manga is because some of the ninja kids such as kiba, lee, and neji were originally going to die to the sound 5 and cause the other teams to grow distant but the editor/jump thought a bunch of kids dying wasnt a good idea. If you only like Naruto because it's a ninja story then you only really like pretimeskip because after that the ninja aspect takes a back burner.",

Therefore, if Itachi is correct, and Sasuke is going against Itachi\u2019s wishes, then it\u2019s understandable that people would be confused as to what the hell the dude\u2019s doing. Specially because even Sasuke constantly sucks Itachi off every chance he gets after the reveal. \n\nSo yeah, you\u2019re right, but the way the story presents itself makes it so that people don\u2019t see it that way.\n\nAlso, Naruto was literally pushed out of places that didn\u2019t want to serve him.

All of them are dead, and everyone in Konoha doesn't even know the truth\u2014 that the Uchiha clan are arguably innocent. Why would he just ignore his feelings on this? Also, I would argue that Itachi isn't presented as correct in his choice. That kid is a fucked up robot when he's a child, traumatized and obsessed with peace. It isn't that slaughtering his clan was \"right\". To Itachi, that was the path of least bloodshed. I would not care about this if it was my family versus an asshole state, and I would think most people wouldn't care, either. Not to mention that the Massacre didn't have to happen, but Danzo just wanted it to. Shisui was prepared to use Kotoamatsukami to end the coup without bloodshed at all before Danzo snaked him and stole his eye.\n\nAll of this is bundled with Sasuke unlocking the Mangekyou, which can warp the user with the Curse of Hatred.",

If you showed someone kid Sasuke and then showed them 13 year old or 17 year old Sasuke, no one would think that's a natural progression.\n\n\nAlso when Naruto beat Gaara, Sasuke corrected Sakura that it was Naruto who saved her. In fact Sasuke's first reaction to Naruto beating Gaara, is a resolve to train harder, it's only with Itachi's appearance and Itachi displaying more interest in Naruto than him do we see Sasuke's jealousy start to take a very unhealthy turn.",

Because as it stand you're putting way more stock in filler than canon.\n\nAlso slight detour but Orochimaru didn't have a happy childhood. He grew up an orphan while developing an unhealthy obsession with immortality which only grew as he saw people close to him die.\n\nAlso the Indra-Ashura conflict can still happen without Sasuke being edgy. I mean in their final battle, Sasuke harbors no ill-will against Naruto. It's a purely ideological battle between power vs cooperation which is what Indra and Ashura were fighting about anyways. And who is to say the conflict has to be a deathmatch. It could very well be a competiton (just like in the Indra-Ashura filler) that Naruto wins and Sasuke could accept Naruto was right and that's that.",

He routinely ordered Suigetsu not to kill people when they entered fights. \n\nI don't like saying this because it's usually baseless, but seriously. What manga did you read? What anime did you watch? Naruto was out for YEARS before Sasuke got his Mangekyou, and throughout all of that time Sasuke has been consistent in his character. He needs power to kill Itachi, but Itachi is the only person he wants to kill. If he was a bloodthirsty weirdo like you seem to think then he wouldn't have gone back to the Leaf village at the end of the series.",

If Naruto or Kakashi was being spoken on, they'd be praised, despite going through less (or in Kakashi's case, simply different). Uchiha simply can't win in this fandom\n\nAlso the Uchiha Clan is definitely innocent. They're a founding clan that was pushed literally into a corner of their village.

All of them are dead, and everyone in Konoha doesn't even know the truth\u2014 that the Uchiha clan are arguably innocent. Why would he just ignore his feelings on this? Also, I would argue that Itachi isn't presented as correct in his choice. That kid is a fucked up robot when he's a child, traumatized and obsessed with peace. It isn't that slaughtering his clan was \"right\". To Itachi, that was the path of least bloodshed. I would not care about this if it was my family versus an asshole state, and I would think most people wouldn't care, either. Not to mention that the Massacre didn't have to happen, but Danzo just wanted it to. Shisui was prepared to use Kotoamatsukami to end the coup without bloodshed at all before Danzo snaked him and stole his eye.\n\nAll of this is bundled with Sasuke unlocking the Mangekyou, which can warp the user with the Curse of Hatred.",

People didn't even understand him, let alone have the insight to call his actions wrong. In episode 152 he literally says people are naive to say he should follow Itachi's wishes, and don't understand how hatred works.",

Because as it stand you're putting way more stock in filler than canon.\n\nAlso slight detour but Orochimaru didn't have a happy childhood. He grew up an orphan while developing an unhealthy obsession with immortality which only grew as he saw people close to him die.\n\nAlso the Indra-Ashura conflict can still happen without Sasuke being edgy. I mean in their final battle, Sasuke harbors no ill-will against Naruto. It's a purely ideological battle between power vs cooperation which is what Indra and Ashura were fighting about anyways. And who is to say the conflict has to be a deathmatch. It could very well be a competiton (just like in the Indra-Ashura filler) that Naruto wins and Sasuke could accept Naruto was right and that's that.",

Uchiha simply can't win in this fandom\n\nAlso the Uchiha Clan is definitely innocent. They're a founding clan that was pushed literally into a corner of their village.

Like I said, it was initially a manga about food because in college kishimoto liked eating ramen at ichiraku.

He grew up an orphan while developing an unhealthy obsession with immortality which only grew as he saw people close to him die.\n\nAlso the Indra-Ashura conflict can still happen without Sasuke being edgy. I mean in their final battle, Sasuke harbors no ill-will against Naruto. It's a purely ideological battle between power vs cooperation which is what Indra and Ashura were fighting about anyways. And who is to say the conflict has to be a deathmatch. It could very well be a competiton (just like in the Indra-Ashura filler) that Naruto wins and Sasuke could accept Naruto was right and that's that.",

If Naruto or Kakashi was being spoken on, they'd be praised, despite going through less (or in Kakashi's case, simply different). Uchiha simply can't win in this fandom\n\nAlso the Uchiha Clan is definitely innocent. They're a founding clan that was pushed literally into a corner of their village. Why would they just nod along with the treatment they received? \n\nIf the Uzumaki clan was being marginalized people would cry bloody murder",
