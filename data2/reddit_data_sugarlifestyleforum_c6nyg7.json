    "body": "1. Never Accept Checks, checks can bounce days after you deposit them, and its a way for you to get scammed\n2. never go inside a house on the first meet, get a feel for them first, and go somewhere public\n3. create a separate bank account if your parents monitoring to give you money,\n4. don't give the login to your bank apps PLEASE!!!!!  they can venmo, cashapp, or direct deposit using your routing number\n5. never trust someone who gives you money before you meet them, this can lead to them EXPECTING and forcing sex on you that you didn't want\n6. do not use your real name, show them your car, tell them about your life.  They can use this to exploit you and you can put yourself in danger **If you think im joking, type in your full name on google and see what im talking about**\n7. always meet in public first, and get there before they do, you want to have the upper hand, these encounters can be dangerous.\n8. always have someone who has access to your location at ALL TIMES, something I like to do is have my best friend receive texts about every hour or every thirty minutes, stay strict to this schedule and let them know if you miss the time, to call for help\n9. Never Accept Sex without protection unless the SD gets tested 30 days out, and then after 30 days the week of sexual contact.  This screens for STD's as well as HIV/AIDs.\n10. Remember, as you get to know your SD, and he gives you reason to trust, then things change, these rules are for girls who are inexperienced and dont understand.  But until you have a **REASON** to stray from these, dont.  And first meetings should always follow these.  These rules are based on things I have learned, or experienced that are meant as guidelines.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRemember ladies, these are older men with a lot of money, and they don't really care about you unless they prove otherwise. Protect who you are, always carry mace, and have an exit route/escape plan if you go to a house or a hotel.  These things can get dangerous, and if you are not prepared you can easily get hurt.  This should be a last resort, and just remember to stay safe\n\nSomething I personally like to do, is request there be no kissing, touching, or sexual encounters that are out of my control.  You should have the power in most cases.  Just remember, if you stick to these rules, you will be all the more safe.  Love you girls, and go get your shmoney\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT\\*\\*\\*\n\nSo since there are conflicting views, let me elaborate.\n\nYou may be a nice guy, but there are almost just as many who are not.  These rules are for first meetings, you should not expect a girl to automatically trust you without any reason or actions to prove you are trustworthy.  These rules are based on my experiences, and a set that I have used to protect myself.\n\nOf course when you get to know someone, things change as you give merit for trust.  But no, I do not think SD's should have to know the intimate facts about a SB's personal life.  You can develope relationships without knowing everything about someone.  In my experience (WHICH IS FUCKING EXTENSIVE AS FUCK), emotional connection is what is important.  I live by \"keep your private life private\" and it has worked for me.  That being said, everyone is different but I will say I have hear **MANY** stories of SB's being manipulated with information of their private life they have given to a SD.\n\n**\"They dont care about you\" this is a mindset to help new girls be assertive about getting their money**\n\nI am not saying every SD doesn't care, but in the beginning, why should I, or anyone expect that you do without merit?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**For all the Sugar Daddies in the comments, Prove yourself, and you get more in return.  If you expect complete trust without merit, then you need to check wtf your doing.  Girls who blindly trust people get taken advantage of and used by older, and manipulative men.  PERIOD! Its just Facts**",

But 5, 6 and the misc tips down below I cannot endorse I think these are a bit too harsh for some sugar dating scenarios. my most recent sugar daddy date sent me his Linden and Universality bio before our meet. I did not revel my real name until our date, but after that I was pretty upfront about my life and my background. He is a well respected man who actually works in a similar field as my career.  Sugar dating can be as much about career networking as it is about getting a nice purse or a bill paid. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEvery sugar has a different style, but I personally like to offer an genuine relationship with my daddies. Not exclusive, not serious, not love. But companionship and warmth, along with youthful sexuality. \n\nThis part especially bothered me:\n\n>  Remember ladies, these are older men with a lot of money, and they don't really care about you. \n\nDefinitely not always true. I have had Daddies that care alot about me and ones I cared for deeply. They check in with me when I mention a family member is sick or congratulate me when I say I got a new job. we remember things about each other, I ask how their kids are doing and we talk about the ups and downs of work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo me, sugar is a two sided relationship. Mutually beneficial is more ways then jsut money.  Its more jsut so paying for the instant relationship, without all the build up or long standing commitment or the big L word. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf things work out with my most recent Sugar date, we will be flying to countries I have never been before and having memorable once in a lifetime experiences. That is means establishing trust and care for one another.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSugaring and Sex work can be very similar and many people classify sugaring as sex work. However, I think your tips are way more relevant to Sex Work levels of transactions. I do both, and this post to me reads like a newbie post for sex workers.",

Sure you can have multiple SD's that'll give you a good allowance but if you don't have an actual connection with them, are any of them gonna stay for the long run? You'll just have to keep searching for a new one and eventually, the pool could run dry. \n\nAnd I know this is just anecdotal but my current SD gave me money before we met.

Perhaps that's just my area. \n \n\nMy point, perhaps this way of viewing it is what it was intended to be, but it isn't usually the case, especially with how blown up it is with SA. Nowadays, I think everyone has their own unique take on what a 'sugar relationship' is.

Of course, when you get to know someone more, you can stray from these guidelines, but at the end of the day, these are (most of the time) MUCH older men meeting 18-20-ish year old girls.  And it is easy to manipulate or take advantage.   Once you have established a relationship, you can, of course accept payment ahead of time etc.  But before you know someone, its the best way to stay safe.  There are a list of girls who have been raped in meetings, and I have had friends who their SD's have used the information that they gave to SD's as a way to exploit them.  I have had genuine relationships EMOTIONALLY using a fake name, and not giving any information about my background.  But remember, these are more for when you first meet someone, better to be EXTRA safe than Extra Sorry.  Yah Feel me?",

Perhaps that's just my area. \n \n\nMy point, perhaps this way of viewing it is what it was intended to be, but it isn't usually the case, especially with how blown up it is with SA. Nowadays, I think everyone has their own unique take on what a 'sugar relationship' is.
