    "body": "A married man is having dinner out with his wife to celebrate his 50th birthday. As they are having dinner, a very attractive and very young woman walks up to him at the table and kisses him in front of his wife and says \"I cant wait to see you tomorrow night\" The man's wife if outraged and says \"Who the hell was that?!\" the man says to his wife \"That's my sugar baby\" His wife gets really angry and says \"That's it! i want a divorce!\" The man says \"OK we can get divorced, but we will have to sell the big house and the house on the beach. We can both move into smaller homes and no more extravagant vacations. But yes, we can get divorced\" The man's wife is thinking about what he has just said, when she sees Bob, a friend of her Husband. Bob is having dinner with a beautiful young woman (not his wife) at a table across the room. She asks her husband \"Who is that having dinner with Bob?\" Her husband replies, \"That's Bob's sugar baby\" The man's wife ponders this for a moment and says \"Ours is prettier\"",
