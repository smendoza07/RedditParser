    "body": "Not even just SDs, I swear not one guy I've ever been with does this responsibly. They ALWAYS go back to the vag w their dick or finger. It pisses me off soooooooo much. It's just so gross and 99% I'll have to go to the dr for an Rx bc of BV or UTI. Which of course then I'll get a yeast infection after. Yay, weeks of torture bc a guy doesnt understand that if you touch my asshole, YOU'RE DONE WITH MY VAG. I wish men treated womens bodies with more respect. Next time I feel like rubbing their fingers all over their eyes so they get pink eye. How do men get this age without knowing safe sex rules?!?!",

That combined with the probable complete lack of sex education when these men were younger and throughout their life leads to these disgusting and dangerous behaviors. This same school of thought can be applied to many issues of sex including but not limited to BDSM, consent, being rough, certain positions etc. \n\nPretty much if a guy sees something in porn he\u2019s going to assume it\u2019s normal/ok which ITS NOT. \n\nThis can be largely solved by communication. Speak up and address these things with your partner and when a partner tells you something LISTEN AND LEARN. If you can\u2019t listen to your partner or can\u2019t agree about safe sex and consent practices, time to reevaluate if you\u2019re ready to be in a sexual relationship.",

            "body": "Please understand that this comment is NOT meant to offend but to enlighten. There's a few issues with this type of thinking that I would like to take the opportunity to address. Number one; it presupposes that the responsibility to know or do is on him. Number two; it also presupposes that the responsibility for your cleanliness is on him as well. Number three; it indicates that ass play is fundamentally gross. And number four; you put a particular standard on \"safe sex rules\" that primarily exists in your own mind.\n\nFor number 1 and 4 there's really no institutions of learning in this western culture that adequately instructs people about there sexuality producing a sever disorientation concerning (all) most things sexual. So responsible sex is nearly improbable between people because of the lack of knowledge. For instance in your case you say men should know not to move from the ass to the vagina, so why isn't it that you should know that your ass should be clean if you allow ass play? And you talk about rules... Should it not be a rule that your ass should be clean if you allow ass play? So responsibility really goes both ways. If you communicated with your partner(s) clearly what your standards are there would be absolutely know reason for you to be upset about anything because your boundaries would be set from the beginning which most people don't even consider doing, they just jump in the bed and expect their partner to know everything without any communication at all. Now that's irresponsibility. If you're not communicating everything before sex I suggest considering you're NOT being responsible. I know this might be a different way of viewing things but safe sex is really about responsible authentic communication between two people and not just about condoms or protection.\n\nFor number 2 and 3 it is your responsibility for your ass to be clean and if it was clean it would NOT be \"gross\" to do ass to mouth or ass to vagina or both. You have to douche to clean your vagina sometimes, correct? It's no difference with the anus. It could use a good cleansing sometimes. Imagine if you never douched? Although I do not care for penetrating my partner's anal cavity (finger or penis) I do enjoy rimming (anal cunnilings) my partner. But I have a standard. She must be clean and I go to the lengths of not just communicating that but making sure by taking romantic intimate showers and getting in there myself if you know what I mean.\n\nSo in short the issue isn't about men being irresponsible when it comes to ass play. It's about if you allow ass play make sure your ass is clean and if you don't allow ass play communicate all of your boundaries at the beginning and if he/she doesn't agree they may not be for you. Furthermore, don't do it if you're NOT clean.",

Or are you a troll bug chaser who gets off on contracting and giving others STDs and similar experiences? That is my guess if you further contradict what literally every other person on this post is saying. If you say that ass to vagina play is okay, you are prob someone who gets off on giving/ getting and others getting/giving diseases etc so please stay careful everyone\ud83d\udc93 edit- autocorrect a word",
