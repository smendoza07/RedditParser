You could give it a few days to calm down, then reassess.\n\nAfter that, if it\u2019s still not looking great, you could try either trimming the top so you could get some upward volume until it grows out overall.",

Most people get itchy from dry skin or irritated skin thats usually form showering too much and more specifically exfoliating too much.",

I work a dirty job during that requires daily showers during the summer months, I'd shower after work and then work out. Despite this, I somehow managed to maintain an intimate relationship and a level of professionalism at work. My mental health did not suffer.\n\nSo, as for the single physical health thing you mentioned being acne: do you have a source for that?",

Because dead cells build up and cause BO. \n\nYou don't have to wash your hair every time you shower. Once or twice a week is fine, but you should condition especially if you have oily hair because it'll help keep the oil production down. \n\nFor body soap and shampoo go for sulfate free. Sulfates are the most harsh and stripping kind of soap which will make you more oily in the long term. When you make the switch you'll have a period where you feel extra greasy because your body has to catch up - you're oily now because you strip too much off and you body makes extra to make up for it. Once your body figures out you stopped doing that it'll produce less oil.",

It will actually lead to worse bo as it disrupts your natural skin flora and leads to overgrowth of bad bacteria. If people get in the habit of showering everyday they will often get bad bo bc they shower every day. Ask your dermatologist if you don\u2019t believe me. \n\nThat said here\u2019s your big problem, I live in the Rockies as well(Colorado), you probably think you have naturally oily hair and skin, it\u2019s extremely unlikely you actually do, it\u2019s just insanely dry in the Rockies which makes your hair and skin over produce oil to compensate for being stupid dry. This is also why you\u2019re probably itchy. You should be conditioning every wash, and once every week or other week doing a co wash( instead of no wash like you are). You also should be using moisturizer( with spf bc we live literally closer to the sun) on your face and lotion on your body. The first week or two you might be extra \u201coily\u201d this will go away as your body chills out and stops over compensating for how dry it is. I know it sounds crazy, I get it, I thought the same when I was younger. I swear though it will fix like a bunch of issues. \n\nFor the style, I can\u2019t tell if the cut is bad, it looks weight down, unstyled and dry to me. You would look super good with a low fade, in the interim use some conditioner and product in your hair, get a curl cr\u00e8me and and some paste to finish it.",

Most people get itchy from dry skin or irritated skin thats usually form showering too much and more specifically exfoliating too much.",

I work a dirty job during that requires daily showers during the summer months, I'd shower after work and then work out. Despite this, I somehow managed to maintain an intimate relationship and a level of professionalism at work.

Once or twice a week is fine, but you should condition especially if you have oily hair because it'll help keep the oil production down. \n\nFor body soap and shampoo go for sulfate free. Sulfates are the most harsh and stripping kind of soap which will make you more oily in the long term. When you make the switch you'll have a period where you feel extra greasy because your body has to catch up - you're oily now because you strip too much off and you body makes extra to make up for it. Once your body figures out you stopped doing that it'll produce less oil.",

It will actually lead to worse bo as it disrupts your natural skin flora and leads to overgrowth of bad bacteria. If people get in the habit of showering everyday they will often get bad bo bc they shower every day. Ask your dermatologist if you don\u2019t believe me. \n\nThat said here\u2019s your big problem, I live in the Rockies as well(Colorado), you probably think you have naturally oily hair and skin, it\u2019s extremely unlikely you actually do, it\u2019s just insanely dry in the Rockies which makes your hair and skin over produce oil to compensate for being stupid dry. This is also why you\u2019re probably itchy. You should be conditioning every wash, and once every week or other week doing a co wash( instead of no wash like you are). You also should be using moisturizer( with spf bc we live literally closer to the sun) on your face and lotion on your body. The first week or two you might be extra \u201coily\u201d this will go away as your body chills out and stops over compensating for how dry it is. I know it sounds crazy, I get it, I thought the same when I was younger. I swear though it will fix like a bunch of issues. \n\nFor the style, I can\u2019t tell if the cut is bad, it looks weight down, unstyled and dry to me. You would look super good with a low fade, in the interim use some conditioner and product in your hair, get a curl cr\u00e8me and and some paste to finish it.",

Most people get itchy from dry skin or irritated skin thats usually form showering too much and more specifically exfoliating too much.",

So your requirement of daily showering for an intimate relationship for mental health is a weird roundabout justification. \n\nAgain, people do not just start smelling bad after a day of not showering, so the professionalism thing for mental health is another weird justification. \n\nI'd argue that exercise does not inherently make one smell bad either. I work a dirty job during that requires daily showers during the summer months, I'd shower after work and then work out. Despite this, I somehow managed to maintain an intimate relationship and a level of professionalism at work. My mental health did not suffer.\n\nSo, as for the single physical health thing you mentioned being acne: do you have a source for that?",

It will actually lead to worse bo as it disrupts your natural skin flora and leads to overgrowth of bad bacteria. If people get in the habit of showering everyday they will often get bad bo bc they shower every day. Ask your dermatologist if you don\u2019t believe me. \n\nThat said here\u2019s your big problem, I live in the Rockies as well(Colorado), you probably think you have naturally oily hair and skin, it\u2019s extremely unlikely you actually do, it\u2019s just insanely dry in the Rockies which makes your hair and skin over produce oil to compensate for being stupid dry. This is also why you\u2019re probably itchy. You should be conditioning every wash, and once every week or other week doing a co wash( instead of no wash like you are). You also should be using moisturizer( with spf bc we live literally closer to the sun) on your face and lotion on your body. The first week or two you might be extra \u201coily\u201d this will go away as your body chills out and stops over compensating for how dry it is. I know it sounds crazy, I get it, I thought the same when I was younger. I swear though it will fix like a bunch of issues. \n\nFor the style, I can\u2019t tell if the cut is bad, it looks weight down, unstyled and dry to me. You would look super good with a low fade, in the interim use some conditioner and product in your hair, get a curl cr\u00e8me and and some paste to finish it.",

I get complimented on how good I smell constantly. The vast majority of people do not need to shower everyday. That doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t groom everyday though. \n\n\n>Your body also secretes oils and dead skin that you should wash off or else it cakes on and you become itchy.

Most people get itchy from dry skin or irritated skin thats usually form showering too much and more specifically exfoliating too much.",

I work a dirty job during that requires daily showers during the summer months, I'd shower after work and then work out.

It will actually lead to worse bo as it disrupts your natural skin flora and leads to overgrowth of bad bacteria. If people get in the habit of showering everyday they will often get bad bo bc they shower every day. Ask your dermatologist if you don\u2019t believe me. \n\nThat said here\u2019s your big problem, I live in the Rockies as well(Colorado), you probably think you have naturally oily hair and skin, it\u2019s extremely unlikely you actually do, it\u2019s just insanely dry in the Rockies which makes your hair and skin over produce oil to compensate for being stupid dry. This is also why you\u2019re probably itchy. You should be conditioning every wash, and once every week or other week doing a co wash( instead of no wash like you are). You also should be using moisturizer( with spf bc we live literally closer to the sun) on your face and lotion on your body. The first week or two you might be extra \u201coily\u201d this will go away as your body chills out and stops over compensating for how dry it is. I know it sounds crazy, I get it, I thought the same when I was younger. I swear though it will fix like a bunch of issues. \n\nFor the style, I can\u2019t tell if the cut is bad, it looks weight down, unstyled and dry to me. You would look super good with a low fade, in the interim use some conditioner and product in your hair, get a curl cr\u00e8me and and some paste to finish it.",

So your requirement of daily showering for an intimate relationship for mental health is a weird roundabout justification. \n\nAgain, people do not just start smelling bad after a day of not showering, so the professionalism thing for mental health is another weird justification. \n\nI'd argue that exercise does not inherently make one smell bad either. I work a dirty job during that requires daily showers during the summer months, I'd shower after work and then work out. Despite this, I somehow managed to maintain an intimate relationship and a level of professionalism at work. My mental health did not suffer.\n\nSo, as for the single physical health thing you mentioned being acne: do you have a source for that?",

I work a dirty job during that requires daily showers during the summer months, I'd shower after work and then work out. Despite this, I somehow managed to maintain an intimate relationship and a level of professionalism at work.

Yes you\u2019re right, you might not stink and get acne from not showering daily well done. But for someone who only showers every 3 days like OP it\u2019s probably good for their mental and physical health to set up a routine of daily showers.

So your requirement of daily showering for an intimate relationship for mental health is a weird roundabout justification. \n\nAgain, people do not just start smelling bad after a day of not showering, so the professionalism thing for mental health is another weird justification. \n\nI'd argue that exercise does not inherently make one smell bad either. I work a dirty job during that requires daily showers during the summer months, I'd shower after work and then work out. Despite this, I somehow managed to maintain an intimate relationship and a level of professionalism at work. My mental health did not suffer.\n\nSo, as for the single physical health thing you mentioned being acne: do you have a source for that?",

The point was about not showering for 3 days in a row consistently. I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019ve fixated so much on the daily shower thing. Yes you\u2019re right, you might not stink and get acne from not showering daily well done. But for someone who only showers every 3 days like OP it\u2019s probably good for their mental and physical health to set up a routine of daily showers. Now please leave me be and go back to being the noble defender of people who don\u2019t shower",

So your requirement of daily showering for an intimate relationship for mental health is a weird roundabout justification. \n\nAgain, people do not just start smelling bad after a day of not showering, so the professionalism thing for mental health is another weird justification. \n\nI'd argue that exercise does not inherently make one smell bad either. I work a dirty job during that requires daily showers during the summer months, I'd shower after work and then work out. Despite this, I somehow managed to maintain an intimate relationship and a level of professionalism at work. My mental health did not suffer.\n\nSo, as for the single physical health thing you mentioned being acne: do you have a source for that?",

That article doesn't say, \"If you don't shower every day, you'll get acne.\" In fact, it explicitly states you *don't* need to shower daily.

Some dermatologists only recommend a shower every other day, or *two to three times a week.*\n\nHow many days is two to three times a week?\n\n\nhttps://www.webmd.com/beauty/shower-how-often#:~:text=Many%20doctors%20say%20a%20daily,better%20to%20maintain%20good%20health.",

The point was about not showering for 3 days in a row consistently. I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019ve fixated so much on the daily shower thing. Yes you\u2019re right, you might not stink and get acne from not showering daily well done. But for someone who only showers every 3 days like OP it\u2019s probably good for their mental and physical health to set up a routine of daily showers.

But for someone who only showers every 3 days like OP it\u2019s probably good for their mental and physical health to set up a routine of daily showers. Now please leave me be and go back to being the noble defender of people who don\u2019t shower",
