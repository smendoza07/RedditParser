    "body": "Yesterday when my SB and I were ~~doing the nasty~~ intimate, there was a moment where I was positioned in between her legs, sat up, looked at her lying down in all her glory and told her just how fucking hot she was. \n\nI legit don\u2019t understand how in the world a short blob like me get to be with this woman. She\u2019s smart, funny, kind, incredibly sweet, tall, has a beautiful face and a smoking hot body. \n\nWe had another wonderful day yesterday where I was basically her TaskRabbit (lol) driving her around to run her errands, ordered takeout and ate in my car. Once her errands were done, we spent the rest of the day back at her apartment watching a movie, cuddling, talking and laughing with each other. We've only had simple dates so far (because pandemic) but just spending time with her has been the best.\n\nThank you to the universe for bringing her to me on the very day the world was going to hell (March 13th). Thank you to the sugar bowl. Thank you to SLF (we met on here). She's just... perfect.",
