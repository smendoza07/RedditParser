I had that in middle school and would twist my hair into a not then pull it out and had a huge bald spot on the top right side of my head and somehow managed to get past it later in life. (I probably spelled the disorder wrong) if it helps around the time I stopped my parents and therapist had got me this ring that you could spin and told me to spin it when I feel like pulling so maybe that could help?\n\nEdit: the ring was a normal ring but had a separate part you could spin atached to it the same shape of the ring. Another piece of advice I could give you is grow a beard if you can. Even now at 26 years old I still tug hairs out of my beard or bite them and pull them out with my teeth when nobody is around and I\u2019m stressed. It\u2019s not as noticeable and when I do shave my beard short enough to not do it it doesn\u2019t bother me very much but I know everyone is different",

Trichotillomania is awful in the sense that you can visually see what you've pulled out because of anxiety. We all have anxieties of some sort and mine is OCD with cleaning. I'm not as bad as I used to be now that I'm working from home, but when I get anxious about something I find myself cleaning stuff because I know I can at least control the end result. So glad you are doing better, as I know some of these disorders are extremely hard to work through and stop doing it. Hang in there and keep up the great work!!",
