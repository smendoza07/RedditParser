    "body": "Hey everyone!\n\nSince I met generally a lot of guys from SA (probably about 30 - many was just for one time ) and I thought I can write. At first, after a short introduction, I will point some random things I observed, then you can find some SB advice I wish I knew. If there is sth you disagree with/ agree it would be great to hear.\n\nMy general observations/experience:\n\n\\-  I noticed was that men are the most prejudiced towards each other. I often heard sth like 'I suppose guys weren't treating you right' or sth that kind. Surprisingly the reality was not bad, nobody was rude in person towards me.\n\n\\- basically, there are just guys seeking mainly sexual experiences. there are some who also want a closer relationship/ talk but it is not a majority. Also, it is probably very hard to find sth platonic as a girl if that's what you want\n\n\\- it is surprising that even some middle-aged guys did not realise that sexting in a first message does not work\n\n\\- meeting older man you can see different lifestyles - see who you want or do not want to become. I always found. it surprising since I started engaging with work in business how much people don't know what they're doing. They talk a lot thinking they know sth but they don't. Also, I found a lot of this on SA\n\n\\- some SDs were nice but not that attractive and tbh it made me feel a bit bad about the men who think that they do not have another option to date than SA\n\n\\- most of the guys there are bankers, lawyers, working in corporations or having small companies. I  met a couple of guys that had impressive careers/ did something impressive but it is a minority\n\n\\- many people don't know what they are doing- at work, business, dating. The same is on here so that my scepticism towards listening to career/ life advice and relying on it too seriously.\n\n\\-  sometimes it requires a couple of meets to meet the right person for you, but it is worth it. It is also always good to be genuine and straightforward\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSB advice I'd wish I got before I joined:\n\n1. Be always honest and straightforward. Life is already complicated & time is scarce, let's not make it more complicated and. be genuine with anyone anywhere including SA\n2. I don't send any nude pics before the meeting/ don't sext or do anything like that. Mainly bc iI don't like it, want to protect my privacy and also some guys just seem to settle on it/ want to talk too much\n3. I realised many guys appreciated having interests/ appearing intelligent (even if there were not :p) so don't hide who you are or pretend dumber ;)\n4. It is not a way to make money - it can be a side thing, when you like someone it is awesome. But the moment you start viewing it as a job, it became not so far off prostitution. If you are struggling to try to find support through uni help funds/ organisations/ work/ family.\n5. Don't meet at the hotel for the first date. It is usually better to have a first meet without any expectation, to see what you put yourself into and check how do you feel with each other. It is like in business - do some analysis before you sign yourself into sth. Even if at first it might be just a couple of meetings not going anywhere it pays off when you get to meet the right person instead of agreeing on the first offer you get\n6. Be respectful and nice -- it should apply for anyone anywhere but I find that on SA you can come across some angry or rude people - just ignore it. It so dumb to waste your emotional energy on getting angry with a random dude online\n7. If you are looking for a mentor/ career advice go to the conferences, try to contact people you admire, use your uni services -- of course it is great if your SD offers you some advice but keep in mind ppl are opinionated, you are the only one who knows your skills and situation. Some of the 'advice' I got was a bit crap so you know\n\nMaybe many of the points I made are obvious, but I would have been better off If I'd known about all this before I started doing it. Hence, there might be a person that finds it helpful.",

            "body": "This is a very interesting post.  Some good advice and some inaccuracies but then again SRs are a YMMV type adventure.  If your context is a \u201ccareer \u201c of 30 mostly one off meetings I\u2019m not sure you got the full experience.   I did it for over 20 years and was still learning.  On your observations:\n- yes guys are highly prejudiced to each other, I\u2019ve found SBs to be the same way.  I think this is common everywhere not just SA though.\n\n- everyone is seeking some form of sexual relationship, anyone that tells you different is lying or trying to scam you wether you realize or not.\n\n- spot on on the sexting in the first message thing.  I think some guys are coming into this with the hooker mindset and it shows.\n\n- people not knowing what they are doing.  Yup, a sad fact of life.  Very few people are in the driver\u2019s seat of their own life.  I\u2019m always of the belief you can learn something from anyone though, just need to keep in mind their experience level.\n\n- yup not every SB is a super model either and it always surprised me that some were surprised to find that out on their own or never did lol.  Don\u2019t be fooled into thinking that every SD is the same either.  Personally I had plenty of options, just chose SRs for simplicity and efficiency.  Then again I\u2019m not a hideous chud either lol.\n\n- need to know who you are with before taking advice.  I know several SDs that are very involved in career mentoring.  Personally that\u2019s part of what I do as a career and I\u2019ve also helped launch several startups with my SBs.  Just depends on the opportunity.  Give me a good idea or business plan and I\u2019ll look at it if I can see you are serious. Again definitely can vary.\n\n- Definitely requires more than 1 meeting.  Rarely would anything good happen from 1 meeting.\n\nOn your numbered advice it\u2019s mainly spot on and should be a requirement to read before you start:\n\n1-3 Absolutely!\n4 - I\u2019d agree here as well.  It should never be considered an income source except in very limited circumstances.  I\u2019ve talked more girls out of doing this than in.  My advice was always if this is something you\u2019d like to do (date older men and find them attractive) then why not be there and get some benefits to compensate you for the occasional inconvenience and compression of the normal course of a relationship.  If you are just here for the money there are easier ways.\n\n5 -  Hell yes, unless there is a coffee shop or restaurant there and the SD is traveling through.  Still I would never set an expectation.\n\n6 -  cant stress this enough.  I could write a book on the unbelievably bad behavior of people I\u2019ve met.  Be polite even if it isn\u2019t what you want.\n\n7 - mostly agree depending on who the SD is.  I\u2019ve heard some horrible advice given to SBs by the guidance office of a school.  Probably explains why they are in a school and not in business.  If you really do want career/ business advice from an SD just make sure they are in a position to give that.  Take the sum of all advice and make your own decision.\n\nAnyway thanks for sharing.  So knowing all that would you consider doing it again?  Why or why not?",

Also I got some interns offers or some SDs that said that they could invest in one of my projects but I never eneded up taking any of that. Not because of any moral values but rather the situation or the thing that I wanted to do things my own way or I just had some examples in my environment where mixing relationship with businiess had often not the best outcomes. \n\nWould I do it again? Well, I don't regret doing it at the time. I met some interesting people had some great time and learned some things from it. Also, I met many people I wouldn't have met otherwise. \nHowever, if I could tell sth to myslef younger knowing what I know now I wouold say to myself to take a uni loan (the reason why I joined SA on the first place was finnancial), learn more about my interests, do more netwroing and work more on my projects instead of dating. At the time I could not know anything for certain and I was always scpetical to loans so did not want to risk. \nAlso, it's hard for me to say what role SA really played in my life. I met especially one guy who was a quite successful entrepreneur and talking to him gave me a really good perspective on things and knowleadge. It also impressed me how much can one person do. The fact that he thought I am similar to him made me belive in myself more which helped me a lot.\nThe other things was some of my SDs I talked to were some kind of investors and I realised how often they invest not really undestaning (or even trying to understand) the concept or science behind business but more based on general trends or the way project is presented which was also a good thing to know.\nIn the future I don't think I will do that again as I'm looking for more long term relationship and I don't care about finnancial side of it.",

I work in software and unfortunately I\u2019d get half my POT from a nearby medical school and I had no idea what advice to offer medical students and told them that when they asked lol.  In order to invest with someone I\u2019d need to know them for a while.  Wouldn\u2019t consider it until at least 6 months or more into it and again it had to be a solid idea and the girl had to have a good work ethic.  2 of my investments are still ongoing and have worked out well to this day but most didn\u2019t make it but that\u2019s typical of startups anyway.  You are right though, I always find it amazing how many people would invest in things with little or no knowledge.",

I'm very curious what that means, I guess it's something different for different girls? Are there careers men have that are universally agreed to be 'better'?

When I said there is a lot of bankers and lawyers I mean it's cool in that generation but what I saw at my uni or among my peers is that many wants to be banker or lawyer and as it was good in the past or still is but I think that in the future demand for those will be much lower (as many banks or that kind of institutions are too big and too old to be efficient or at least I saw very questionable things and ways to do things while working there). Also, in my uni or at the time I knew many ppl in investment banks and law firms so at some point I wanted to meet people who did things differently.\n\nI respect all the professions and know we need them all (or most), but I was more into looking for people who did something what I found inspiring/ significant in therms of business or any field they are at. I know it is a minority and I don't think that career sucess makes anyone a better person but idk it's just more interesting for me. I just like meeting people with unusual but interesing views about the future or technology or any field they are into.\n\n Also, the career thing is not the most imporant in dating, just was a bit of my interest since I was trying to figure out what I want to do and how to do it.",

Also I got some interns offers or some SDs that said that they could invest in one of my projects but I never eneded up taking any of that. Not because of any moral values but rather the situation or the thing that I wanted to do things my own way or I just had some examples in my environment where mixing relationship with businiess had often not the best outcomes. \n\nWould I do it again? Well, I don't regret doing it at the time. I met some interesting people had some great time and learned some things from it. Also, I met many people I wouldn't have met otherwise. \nHowever, if I could tell sth to myslef younger knowing what I know now I wouold say to myself to take a uni loan (the reason why I joined SA on the first place was finnancial), learn more about my interests, do more netwroing and work more on my projects instead of dating. At the time I could not know anything for certain and I was always scpetical to loans so did not want to risk. \nAlso, it's hard for me to say what role SA really played in my life. I met especially one guy who was a quite successful entrepreneur and talking to him gave me a really good perspective on things and knowleadge. It also impressed me how much can one person do. The fact that he thought I am similar to him made me belive in myself more which helped me a lot.\nThe other things was some of my SDs I talked to were some kind of investors and I realised how often they invest not really undestaning (or even trying to understand) the concept or science behind business but more based on general trends or the way project is presented which was also a good thing to know.\nIn the future I don't think I will do that again as I'm looking for more long term relationship and I don't care about finnancial side of it.",

In order to invest with someone I\u2019d need to know them for a while.

Also, in my uni or at the time I knew many ppl in investment banks and law firms so at some point I wanted to meet people who did things differently.\n\nI respect all the professions and know we need them all (or most), but I was more into looking for people who did something what I found inspiring/ significant in therms of business or any field they are at.

I work in software and unfortunately I\u2019d get half my POT from a nearby medical school and I had no idea what advice to offer medical students and told them that when they asked lol.  In order to invest with someone I\u2019d need to know them for a while.  Wouldn\u2019t consider it until at least 6 months or more into it and again it had to be a solid idea and the girl had to have a good work ethic.  2 of my investments are still ongoing and have worked out well to this day but most didn\u2019t make it but that\u2019s typical of startups anyway.  You are right though, I always find it amazing how many people would invest in things with little or no knowledge.",

I do have high expectations not financial but generally about people\u2019s interests and what they do because otherwise I got bored quickly. It is definitely my perception of life and dating and I am totally fine that it goes with one off meetings as I think it is better to meet someone I am not sure about once over than waste more time on it. I met some great people I had longer arrangements with and it was wonderful in any aspect of it that lasted for a couple of months because I was also traveling out of London for some time so it usually ended naturally because of geographic reasons \nThe point I wanted to make is also not to agree on the first person you meet but to seek what truly workers the best. I don\u2019t mean to complain, more to share thoughts that would be helpful for me to know when I started.",
