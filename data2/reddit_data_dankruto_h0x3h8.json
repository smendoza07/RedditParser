The main Sharingan user most ninjas faced was probably Kakashi due to his insane amount of missions. Especially when he was in the Anbu. He was pretty proficient with the Sharingan too. He was the Leaf\u2019s right hand man. And he\u2019s a threat to most ninjas because the Sharingan and lightning blade is OP to fodder. He had a lot of run ins with the Akatsuki as well and whenever they ran into him shit went down. They even said to be careful of his teams since they gave Deidara trouble and they killed Hidan and Kakazu. He didn\u2019t defeat them himself but his intelligence and jutsu variety were deemed a threat by Pain. His teamwork and leadership are his strongest abilities imo. Even tho most of the Akatsuki would demolish him pre War Arc in a 1v1.",

Those who trigger it at a young age are praised (eg Itachi).\n\nThen, within those who awaken it, some may only keep it at 1 tomoe. A part of those may eventually get to 2, and finally a few to 3 and only a handful reach the Mangekyo.\n\nMy belief (but it's only a headcanon) is that only a few Uchihas had 3-tomoe Sharingans even before the massacre; add to that the fact that the Uchihas were responsible for Konoha's police forces, and you don't have that many wandering around the world.\n\nBasically, their reputation is mainly due to Madara and their history with the Senju that shaped the ninja world, but I imagine almost no one outside of Konoha really fought an Uchiha in the recent times (after, say... Tobirama became Hokage). The lack of experience of many ninjas against the Sharingan (Zabuza, Kurenai, Asuma, Deidara...) tends to show that people mostly \"heard\" of the Sharingan but never faced it in practice or had an opportunity to really gauge its powers.",

He was the Leaf\u2019s right hand man. And he\u2019s a threat to most ninjas because the Sharingan and lightning blade is OP to fodder. He had a lot of run ins with the Akatsuki as well and whenever they ran into him shit went down. They even said to be careful of his teams since they gave Deidara trouble and they killed Hidan and Kakazu. He didn\u2019t defeat them himself but his intelligence and jutsu variety were deemed a threat by Pain. His teamwork and leadership are his strongest abilities imo. Even tho most of the Akatsuki would demolish him pre War Arc in a 1v1.",

Those who trigger it at a young age are praised (eg Itachi).\n\nThen, within those who awaken it, some may only keep it at 1 tomoe. A part of those may eventually get to 2, and finally a few to 3 and only a handful reach the Mangekyo.\n\nMy belief (but it's only a headcanon) is that only a few Uchihas had 3-tomoe Sharingans even before the massacre; add to that the fact that the Uchihas were responsible for Konoha's police forces, and you don't have that many wandering around the world.\n\nBasically, their reputation is mainly due to Madara and their history with the Senju that shaped the ninja world, but I imagine almost no one outside of Konoha really fought an Uchiha in the recent times (after, say... Tobirama became Hokage). The lack of experience of many ninjas against the Sharingan (Zabuza, Kurenai, Asuma, Deidara...) tends to show that people mostly \"heard\" of the Sharingan but never faced it in practice or had an opportunity to really gauge its powers.",

And Kakashi was a beast who could probably take down most of the Uchiha in a 1 to 1.",
