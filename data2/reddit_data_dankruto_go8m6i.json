So it just laid dormant for a long time because how would he know the way to activate it if he didint even know he had it ? After the initial activation I believe its up to the user to bring it back out again. \n\nIf I remember right, he passes out after killing Rin and when he wakes up there's no indication that he has Mangekyo but he also gains the third tomoe for his eye because of  Rin's death too, so I'm sure he noticed that change. If he hadn't gained that tomoe he wouldn't even have any reason to believe that killing her had  any effect on his sharingan. I do wonder if HE wondered why it was suddenly there though. I think he learns of the mangekyo's existence when fighting Itachi, so he probably did what research he could and was then able to deduce that he had gained it some time ago. \n\nBut then he had to learn how to activate and properly use it which I'm sure took a fuck-ton of time especially since not being an Uchiha means the sharingan just eats at his chakra and mangekyo uses like double the amount as regular sharingan. He mentions to Naruto that hes working on a new super jutsu or something which I assume was kamui. So its possible that it just took him that long to master it after learning of it, and he didint learn of until years after he uocked it. \n\n\nAlso, Not being an Uchiha himself and also being distrusted and looked down upon  for being a non-blood with Obito's sharingan he never really learned anything about it other than what he was able to teach himself on the battlefield and through  personal training. Its not like he could just go to the library and check out a \"Sharingan For Dummies\" book. Sasuke wasn't even aware of its existence, and you could say that's because anybody who would have taught him had been killed, but the only readable  info about it was also engraved into an ancient tablet that the clan kept hidden way deep underground in a bunker with a creepy winding staircase for decades. Again I could be remembering wrong, but I think its kind of implied that not every Uchiha, even the ones with sharingan, knew everything about it or even everything about the clan. \n\nSo yeah, maybe if Kakashi hadn't passed out he would have noticed gaining a new ability (he wouldn't even realize what he was gaining, he wouldn't know it was called mangekyo) he would have been using it before the war arc but he did so he never knew he had unlocked it.",

So it just laid dormant for a long time because how would he know the way to activate it if he didint even know he had it ? After the initial activation I believe its up to the user to bring it back out again. \n\nIf I remember right, he passes out after killing Rin and when he wakes up there's no indication that he has Mangekyo but he also gains the third tomoe for his eye because of  Rin's death too, so I'm sure he noticed that change. If he hadn't gained that tomoe he wouldn't even have any reason to believe that killing her had  any effect on his sharingan. I do wonder if HE wondered why it was suddenly there though. I think he learns of the mangekyo's existence when fighting Itachi, so he probably did what research he could and was then able to deduce that he had gained it some time ago. \n\nBut then he had to learn how to activate and properly use it which I'm sure took a fuck-ton of time especially since not being an Uchiha means the sharingan just eats at his chakra and mangekyo uses like double the amount as regular sharingan. He mentions to Naruto that hes working on a new super jutsu or something which I assume was kamui. So its possible that it just took him that long to master it after learning of it, and he didint learn of until years after he uocked it. \n\n\nAlso, Not being an Uchiha himself and also being distrusted and looked down upon  for being a non-blood with Obito's sharingan he never really learned anything about it other than what he was able to teach himself on the battlefield and through  personal training. Its not like he could just go to the library and check out a \"Sharingan For Dummies\" book. Sasuke wasn't even aware of its existence, and you could say that's because anybody who would have taught him had been killed, but the only readable  info about it was also engraved into an ancient tablet that the clan kept hidden way deep underground in a bunker with a creepy winding staircase for decades. Again I could be remembering wrong, but I think its kind of implied that not every Uchiha, even the ones with sharingan, knew everything about it or even everything about the clan. \n\nSo yeah, maybe if Kakashi hadn't passed out he would have noticed gaining a new ability (he wouldn't even realize what he was gaining, he wouldn't know it was called mangekyo) he would have been using it before the war arc but he did so he never knew he had unlocked it.",

So it just laid dormant for a long time because how would he know the way to activate it if he didint even know he had it ? After the initial activation I believe its up to the user to bring it back out again. \n\nIf I remember right, he passes out after killing Rin and when he wakes up there's no indication that he has Mangekyo but he also gains the third tomoe for his eye because of  Rin's death too, so I'm sure he noticed that change. If he hadn't gained that tomoe he wouldn't even have any reason to believe that killing her had  any effect on his sharingan. I do wonder if HE wondered why it was suddenly there though. I think he learns of the mangekyo's existence when fighting Itachi, so he probably did what research he could and was then able to deduce that he had gained it some time ago. \n\nBut then he had to learn how to activate and properly use it which I'm sure took a fuck-ton of time especially since not being an Uchiha means the sharingan just eats at his chakra and mangekyo uses like double the amount as regular sharingan. He mentions to Naruto that hes working on a new super jutsu or something which I assume was kamui. So its possible that it just took him that long to master it after learning of it, and he didint learn of until years after he uocked it. \n\n\nAlso, Not being an Uchiha himself and also being distrusted and looked down upon  for being a non-blood with Obito's sharingan he never really learned anything about it other than what he was able to teach himself on the battlefield and through  personal training. Its not like he could just go to the library and check out a \"Sharingan For Dummies\" book. Sasuke wasn't even aware of its existence, and you could say that's because anybody who would have taught him had been killed, but the only readable  info about it was also engraved into an ancient tablet that the clan kept hidden way deep underground in a bunker with a creepy winding staircase for decades. Again I could be remembering wrong, but I think its kind of implied that not every Uchiha, even the ones with sharingan, knew everything about it or even everything about the clan. \n\nSo yeah, maybe if Kakashi hadn't passed out he would have noticed gaining a new ability (he wouldn't even realize what he was gaining, he wouldn't know it was called mangekyo) he would have been using it before the war arc but he did so he never knew he had unlocked it.",

So it just laid dormant for a long time because how would he know the way to activate it if he didint even know he had it ? After the initial activation I believe its up to the user to bring it back out again. \n\nIf I remember right, he passes out after killing Rin and when he wakes up there's no indication that he has Mangekyo but he also gains the third tomoe for his eye because of  Rin's death too, so I'm sure he noticed that change. If he hadn't gained that tomoe he wouldn't even have any reason to believe that killing her had  any effect on his sharingan. I do wonder if HE wondered why it was suddenly there though. I think he learns of the mangekyo's existence when fighting Itachi, so he probably did what research he could and was then able to deduce that he had gained it some time ago. \n\nBut then he had to learn how to activate and properly use it which I'm sure took a fuck-ton of time especially since not being an Uchiha means the sharingan just eats at his chakra and mangekyo uses like double the amount as regular sharingan. He mentions to Naruto that hes working on a new super jutsu or something which I assume was kamui. So its possible that it just took him that long to master it after learning of it, and he didint learn of until years after he uocked it. \n\n\nAlso, Not being an Uchiha himself and also being distrusted and looked down upon  for being a non-blood with Obito's sharingan he never really learned anything about it other than what he was able to teach himself on the battlefield and through  personal training. Its not like he could just go to the library and check out a \"Sharingan For Dummies\" book. Sasuke wasn't even aware of its existence, and you could say that's because anybody who would have taught him had been killed, but the only readable  info about it was also engraved into an ancient tablet that the clan kept hidden way deep underground in a bunker with a creepy winding staircase for decades. Again I could be remembering wrong, but I think its kind of implied that not every Uchiha, even the ones with sharingan, knew everything about it or even everything about the clan. \n\nSo yeah, maybe if Kakashi hadn't passed out he would have noticed gaining a new ability (he wouldn't even realize what he was gaining, he wouldn't know it was called mangekyo) he would have been using it before the war arc but he did so he never knew he had unlocked it.",

And Sasuke wasn't able to use the Mangekyo until after Itachi implanted the Amaterasu in Sasuke's Sharingan.\n\nIt also seems Sasuke didn't have control over the Sharingan until he processed Itachi's death (the Amaterasu being a reactive trigger to Obito's Sharingan, I don't think that counts as control).\n\nI don't disagree with you, I just think there's quite a bit of technical information lacking from the story in general with these OP abilities lmao",

So it just laid dormant for a long time because how would he know the way to activate it if he didint even know he had it ? After the initial activation I believe its up to the user to bring it back out again. \n\nIf I remember right, he passes out after killing Rin and when he wakes up there's no indication that he has Mangekyo but he also gains the third tomoe for his eye because of  Rin's death too, so I'm sure he noticed that change. If he hadn't gained that tomoe he wouldn't even have any reason to believe that killing her had  any effect on his sharingan. I do wonder if HE wondered why it was suddenly there though. I think he learns of the mangekyo's existence when fighting Itachi, so he probably did what research he could and was then able to deduce that he had gained it some time ago. \n\nBut then he had to learn how to activate and properly use it which I'm sure took a fuck-ton of time especially since not being an Uchiha means the sharingan just eats at his chakra and mangekyo uses like double the amount as regular sharingan. He mentions to Naruto that hes working on a new super jutsu or something which I assume was kamui. So its possible that it just took him that long to master it after learning of it, and he didint learn of until years after he uocked it. \n\n\nAlso, Not being an Uchiha himself and also being distrusted and looked down upon  for being a non-blood with Obito's sharingan he never really learned anything about it other than what he was able to teach himself on the battlefield and through  personal training. Its not like he could just go to the library and check out a \"Sharingan For Dummies\" book. Sasuke wasn't even aware of its existence, and you could say that's because anybody who would have taught him had been killed, but the only readable  info about it was also engraved into an ancient tablet that the clan kept hidden way deep underground in a bunker with a creepy winding staircase for decades. Again I could be remembering wrong, but I think its kind of implied that not every Uchiha, even the ones with sharingan, knew everything about it or even everything about the clan. \n\nSo yeah, maybe if Kakashi hadn't passed out he would have noticed gaining a new ability (he wouldn't even realize what he was gaining, he wouldn't know it was called mangekyo) he would have been using it before the war arc but he did so he never knew he had unlocked it.",

So it just laid dormant for a long time because how would he know the way to activate it if he didint even know he had it ? After the initial activation I believe its up to the user to bring it back out again. \n\nIf I remember right, he passes out after killing Rin and when he wakes up there's no indication that he has Mangekyo but he also gains the third tomoe for his eye because of  Rin's death too, so I'm sure he noticed that change. If he hadn't gained that tomoe he wouldn't even have any reason to believe that killing her had  any effect on his sharingan. I do wonder if HE wondered why it was suddenly there though. I think he learns of the mangekyo's existence when fighting Itachi, so he probably did what research he could and was then able to deduce that he had gained it some time ago. \n\nBut then he had to learn how to activate and properly use it which I'm sure took a fuck-ton of time especially since not being an Uchiha means the sharingan just eats at his chakra and mangekyo uses like double the amount as regular sharingan. He mentions to Naruto that hes working on a new super jutsu or something which I assume was kamui. So its possible that it just took him that long to master it after learning of it, and he didint learn of until years after he uocked it. \n\n\nAlso, Not being an Uchiha himself and also being distrusted and looked down upon  for being a non-blood with Obito's sharingan he never really learned anything about it other than what he was able to teach himself on the battlefield and through  personal training. Its not like he could just go to the library and check out a \"Sharingan For Dummies\" book. Sasuke wasn't even aware of its existence, and you could say that's because anybody who would have taught him had been killed, but the only readable  info about it was also engraved into an ancient tablet that the clan kept hidden way deep underground in a bunker with a creepy winding staircase for decades. Again I could be remembering wrong, but I think its kind of implied that not every Uchiha, even the ones with sharingan, knew everything about it or even everything about the clan. \n\nSo yeah, maybe if Kakashi hadn't passed out he would have noticed gaining a new ability (he wouldn't even realize what he was gaining, he wouldn't know it was called mangekyo) he would have been using it before the war arc but he did so he never knew he had unlocked it.",

It isn't until the fight with Madara and Tobi where he's using it more than like 30 seconds \ud83d\ude02 \n\nQuick edit: Also, Sasuke asked his father about Mangekyo, after seeing Itachi glare at his father with it...but the response was vague as hell",

            "body": "I always thought that the reason he never used it is because he wasn't even aware that he had it. So it just laid dormant for a long time because how would he know the way to activate it if he didint even know he had it ? After the initial activation I believe its up to the user to bring it back out again. \n\nIf I remember right, he passes out after killing Rin and when he wakes up there's no indication that he has Mangekyo but he also gains the third tomoe for his eye because of  Rin's death too, so I'm sure he noticed that change. If he hadn't gained that tomoe he wouldn't even have any reason to believe that killing her had  any effect on his sharingan. I do wonder if HE wondered why it was suddenly there though. I think he learns of the mangekyo's existence when fighting Itachi, so he probably did what research he could and was then able to deduce that he had gained it some time ago. \n\nBut then he had to learn how to activate and properly use it which I'm sure took a fuck-ton of time especially since not being an Uchiha means the sharingan just eats at his chakra and mangekyo uses like double the amount as regular sharingan. He mentions to Naruto that hes working on a new super jutsu or something which I assume was kamui. So its possible that it just took him that long to master it after learning of it, and he didint learn of until years after he uocked it. \n\n\nAlso, Not being an Uchiha himself and also being distrusted and looked down upon  for being a non-blood with Obito's sharingan he never really learned anything about it other than what he was able to teach himself on the battlefield and through  personal training. Its not like he could just go to the library and check out a \"Sharingan For Dummies\" book. Sasuke wasn't even aware of its existence, and you could say that's because anybody who would have taught him had been killed, but the only readable  info about it was also engraved into an ancient tablet that the clan kept hidden way deep underground in a bunker with a creepy winding staircase for decades. Again I could be remembering wrong, but I think its kind of implied that not every Uchiha, even the ones with sharingan, knew everything about it or even everything about the clan. \n\nSo yeah, maybe if Kakashi hadn't passed out he would have noticed gaining a new ability (he wouldn't even realize what he was gaining, he wouldn't know it was called mangekyo) he would have been using it before the war arc but he did so he never knew he had unlocked it.",
