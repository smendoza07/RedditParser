It has both Ashura and Indra chakra from birth\n\nThe whole reincarnation angle is nonsense since all members of the Uchiha and Senju clan would have bits of Asura and Indra's chakra being their desecendants. It was this chakra which gave the Uchiha their Sharingan and the Senju their massive reserves of Chakra. Though the Uzumaki seem to have inherited the bulk of that.\n\nThus theoretically by combining the two, a person should have a massive amount of power (in the case of Obito).",

It was this chakra which gave the Uchiha their Sharingan and the Senju their massive reserves of Chakra. Though the Uzumaki seem to have inherited the bulk of that.\n\nThus theoretically by combining the two, a person should have a massive amount of power (in the case of Obito).",

It has both Ashura and Indra chakra from birth\n\nThe whole reincarnation angle is nonsense since all members of the Uchiha and Senju clan would have bits of Asura and Indra's chakra being their desecendants. It was this chakra which gave the Uchiha their Sharingan and the Senju their massive reserves of Chakra. Though the Uzumaki seem to have inherited the bulk of that.\n\nThus theoretically by combining the two, a person should have a massive amount of power (in the case of Obito).",
