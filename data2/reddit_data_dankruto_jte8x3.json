Once they figured out about teamwork with the Zabuza fight they really showed how they matured into a camaraderie similar to that of Kakashi and Might. Sasuke didn\u2019t even seem as jealous during that part, more so he was amazed at narutos growth. I remember it being more he got jealous once Itachi came back for the next arc and sasuke was still weak yet naruto had exponential growth from his Sanin training. Plus his whole descent into anger/hate for power",

That must have been tremendously validating for a person like Naruto who has felt overlooked his entire life. I don\u2019t believe that the bond that they constantly refer to was ever really \u201cfriendship\u201d as we might think of it, but rather a mutual sort of grudging admiration.",

Those things exist, but they're hardly ever in the spotlight of the show, and when they are shown in organizations like the Liberation Army or the Yakuza, they're dealt with in a single arc almost immediately. Gundam is a show that is politically complex and intriguing, it asks complex moral questions. MHA is a generic villain-of-the-week type show that struggles with its atttempts at moral complexity. It does attempt it, and in some places i.e. Endeavour it succeeds with flying colors, but in most places the thematic questions the show asks are boring, unimaginative, and simple.",

Not to mention if we're talking about thematic consistency, the \"theme\" if you can call it that of MHA's starting premise is literally betrayed in the first two episodes by the MC receiving the most OP super power in the entire series.

I know a lot of people that like the anime, which is why I watched it entirely, but I seriously don't get it. Normally something isn't your taste but you can still understand the appeal, yknow?",

Also because she went out in a way that proved her strength and that she was not just the token girl in a group of super strong ninjas.\n\nIno because she's the only girl who puts friendship above romance. She may not always pass the Bechdel with words, but she certainly passes it with actions (putting Sakura above her feelings for Sasuke numerous times, her platonic bond with Inoshikacho, her love for her father or Asuma etc). Also she's the only female leader of her squad, and she was pretty useful as a character.",

Sadly, once Shippuden arrived she was a pretty wasted character in my opinion. For most of Shippuden she was pretty much downgraded to a Naruto Fan-girl and merely used as a device to make it believable that those in a high position would let Naruto go on - what was from their perspective - suicide-missions. It *did* get better later in the war arc, but her actually interesting flaws never really played a meaningful role again.  \n  \n>Konan  \n  \nGotta have to disagree here. While it did make sense story-wise why she was side-lined, it still, at least to me, felt like she actually *was* the token-female - not only in the Akatsuki, but in her 3-man-squad aswell. Her death was pretty much the only time in the story she made a decision on her own accord and in the end, it didn't even matter (i swear that wasn't a linkin park reference). She was also the only Akatsuki member that had arguably no impact. Was she weak? By no means, but compared to the rest of the Akatsuki i'd say she was about average. But I don't really think that's too relevant. In my opinion the Akatsuki shine because of their personalities and she... just doesn't really have a lot of personality. Jiraiya said she was always kind and that was shown... a bit i think, but aside from that her defining character trait was that she believed in her male companions and that's kinda weak.  \nAlso, not really relevant to this, but the fact that out of 11 members she was the only female is... telling.\n  \n>Kushina  \n\nDefinitely agree. \n  \n>Ino  \n  \nI gotta disagree again. There's only really three characters who have a big focus on romance, Ino, Sakura and Hinata. Yes, Hinata apparently exists only to love Naruto and have him ignore her, even though it makes no sense after Pain, but Sakura in fact shifts quite a lot away from this aswell, especially as of the five Kage summit. And while that shift wasn't really greatly accomplished imo, it does mean Ino isn't really the only one to have this shift happen. The bigger problem Ino has however, would be that she just doesn't do anything. In Part one she doesn't do a lot, although the two small parts where she *did* do something were... fine i guess. Her coming to Sakuras rescue was a nice touch and her fight with Sakura was... ok i think. But starting Shippuden her first appearences were all comic relief (first the misunderstanding after the Sai fight and then the moment where Sai accidentally makes her a compliment). After this she was completely irrelevant in the Hidan & Kakuzu arc (She didn't fight in the first fight and literally just sat/stood around for the second fight.) only to basically disappear until the Pain vs. Konoha arc where she was yet again just standing/sitting or sometimes at least running around. Then we go back to irrelevancy until their fight with Asuma, which was solely Choji's time to shine (Seriously, we had two arcs, or at least one arc and one sub arc focus on team 10 and she has no character development in those at all). The only kinda interesting part for her was when her dad died and she gave her all to help with the communication between everyone. I know fights and usefulness in combat aren't all when it comes to a character, but personalitywise it was even worse. It felt like she went from \"Sakura-but-blonde\" before their fight to almost no personality at all, up until the very last bits of Shippuden.",

After that, she gave away her position to alert her team of a big incoming attack and then she offered to fight Hidan by herself but Shikamaru rejected the idea because she was their only healer and she had to keep herself protected, which narratively makes sense.\n\nIn the Pain arc she doesn't fight, yes, but she helps figure out how Pain works and where his real body is located. Again, her contributions are more than most others'.\n\nThen in the war she's arguably one of the most important ninja. She is the one to succeed in sealing one of the Kin/Gin bros. She urges her team to fight their sensei alongside her and you may say that the fight is about Choji, but Ino is pulling more than her own weight in that fight, literally fighting in Choji's place until he finds the motivation to fight by himself. Then she saves Naruto/Bee/the rest by possessing Obito and redirecting a Bijuu bomb, and that's before her dad even dies and she has to take his place and run all the communications for the alliance by herself. This puts her above everyone who isn't team 7 and maybe Shikamaru.\n\nSave for Sakura and Tsunade, I don't think there's a female character who's done more in the manga than Ino.",

It's not like the gigantic explosion in front of them was hard to detect, they knew it was coming. She could've easily stayed hidden and waited for an opportunity to attack. Especially with her ability she could've make a huge difference (not that it mattered obviously), but this way she just waisted all that potential. Now it's not like what she did made no sense, but there'd be other ways to have her act in this fight that would've been more interesting.  \n  \nThat said, i gotta say my memories of the war especially were apparently a bit fuzzy. You're right, she did actually do quite a bit more than i remembered and she *does* do a lot more than most of the Konoha rookies.  \n  \nAlso it's not like i think she's an awful character, it's just that she's again a case that gets overshadowed by her teammates. Choji had two pretty great emotional arcs for himself, in the Sasuke rescue arc and again in the war arc and we probably won't have to talk about Shikamaru. Would've just been great to have something more in that direction for her.",

For example it would be way less risky for her to possess Hidan, walk into Shikamaru's trap and then switch back to her body than the scenario that ended up happening, but I think narratively Kishimoto wanted Hidan to be Shikamaru's personal grudge and Kakuzu to be used to showcase rasenshuriken, so there was nothing really left for Ino to do except support, heal and sense.",

They both knew the pain of being outcasts and within the rivalry was another bond of just understanding each other. And then there\u2019s naruto goal of erasing hate and pain and his ultimate target, the one who needs it most and who naruto could never cure it of, was sasuke.\n\nOr that\u2019s how I take it anyway. Still doesn\u2019t make the most sense that he sees sasuke as his \u201cbest friend\u201d when he has someone like Shikamaru and Iruka and everyone in this meme p much",

When Sasuke's life spirals further, Naruto pushes even harder because he recognizes that dark place from when he was young. Iruka helped Naruto out of that pit, Naruto helped Gaara and no matter how long it takes, he's determined to help Sasuke. Sadly, Sasuke's situation is complicated by the ninja world, the Akatsuki's schemes, and Sasuke's own mental health. \n\nThe gay undertones are also a thing though. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

You got Sasuke who was mentally abused and brainwashed by his brother that was a victim of the shinobi system and the other who was essentially born into nothingness, a demon inside of him, and a village who hated him for no reason (not to mention one\u2019s whole clan was massacred and the other\u2019s parents were killed cause of that same system). It makes sense to me how Sasuke would suppress his bond/feelings toward Naruto since he would grow to view it as a weakness in his pursuit for strength to kill his brother. Naruto on the other hand never had bonds and had to make them on his own, albeit in an unhealthy way, but it still makes sense cause he grew up without a family and the opportunity to organically make bonds. Tbh it wouldve been unrealistic imo if they were friendly rivals like guy and kakashi.",

There's just no foundation to it, and I doubt there could ever be, but the worse is there were no shortage of events where the **reasonable** path would be for Naruto to, at the very least, just drop it.\n\nI think it's foolish to expect the \"realistic\" from manga/anime, and that's not why I didn't like this whole thing, it's because it was terribly done.

Iruka lost his parents to the ninetails when he was a kid and actually showed him fatherly love in literally the first few episodes. Jiriyah literally took in 3 orphaned kids as his students and he did the same thing as Naruto by chasing Orochimaru when he left like Naruto did for Sasuke. \n\nAlso even if it is \"filler\" shikamaru was shown as one of narutos only friends as a kid along with choji which I consider cannon because its literally in the show ontop of just befriending him throughout the series quickly. \n\nAge doesn't rule out life experience so the \"age\" thing doesn't count at all. Sasuke didn't understand Naruto until literally the last episode where they have to fucking rip each others arms off for him to understand. If he did actually understand at any point this series would be dead lmao.",

That must have been tremendously validating for a person like Naruto who has felt overlooked his entire life. I don\u2019t believe that the bond that they constantly refer to was ever really \u201cfriendship\u201d as we might think of it, but rather a mutual sort of grudging admiration.",

Those things exist, but they're hardly ever in the spotlight of the show, and when they are shown in organizations like the Liberation Army or the Yakuza, they're dealt with in a single arc almost immediately. Gundam is a show that is politically complex and intriguing, it asks complex moral questions. MHA is a generic villain-of-the-week type show that struggles with its atttempts at moral complexity. It does attempt it, and in some places i.e. Endeavour it succeeds with flying colors, but in most places the thematic questions the show asks are boring, unimaginative, and simple.",

Not to mention if we're talking about thematic consistency, the \"theme\" if you can call it that of MHA's starting premise is literally betrayed in the first two episodes by the MC receiving the most OP super power in the entire series.

I mean, 99% of episodes/chapters probably wouldn't even pass the Bechdel-test and that's quite abysmal for a series with *720* episodes, without fillers probably still above 400, or 700 chapters.",

Also because she went out in a way that proved her strength and that she was not just the token girl in a group of super strong ninjas.\n\nIno because she's the only girl who puts friendship above romance. She may not always pass the Bechdel with words, but she certainly passes it with actions (putting Sakura above her feelings for Sasuke numerous times, her platonic bond with Inoshikacho, her love for her father or Asuma etc).

                                    "body": "For those who haven't watched all of Shippuden yet (as someone already mentioned): This is gonna contain a lot of spoilers, so beware.\n\n>Tsunade   \n  \nI definitely agree with you on her arc in overcoming her phobia and trauma, this was arguably the best arc for a female character in the whole series. Sadly, once Shippuden arrived she was a pretty wasted character in my opinion. For most of Shippuden she was pretty much downgraded to a Naruto Fan-girl and merely used as a device to make it believable that those in a high position would let Naruto go on - what was from their perspective - suicide-missions. It *did* get better later in the war arc, but her actually interesting flaws never really played a meaningful role again.  \n  \n>Konan  \n  \nGotta have to disagree here. While it did make sense story-wise why she was side-lined, it still, at least to me, felt like she actually *was* the token-female - not only in the Akatsuki, but in her 3-man-squad aswell. Her death was pretty much the only time in the story she made a decision on her own accord and in the end, it didn't even matter (i swear that wasn't a linkin park reference). She was also the only Akatsuki member that had arguably no impact. Was she weak? By no means, but compared to the rest of the Akatsuki i'd say she was about average. But I don't really think that's too relevant. In my opinion the Akatsuki shine because of their personalities and she... just doesn't really have a lot of personality. Jiraiya said she was always kind and that was shown... a bit i think, but aside from that her defining character trait was that she believed in her male companions and that's kinda weak.  \nAlso, not really relevant to this, but the fact that out of 11 members she was the only female is... telling.\n  \n>Kushina  \n\nDefinitely agree. \n  \n>Ino  \n  \nI gotta disagree again. There's only really three characters who have a big focus on romance, Ino, Sakura and Hinata. Yes, Hinata apparently exists only to love Naruto and have him ignore her, even though it makes no sense after Pain, but Sakura in fact shifts quite a lot away from this aswell, especially as of the five Kage summit. And while that shift wasn't really greatly accomplished imo, it does mean Ino isn't really the only one to have this shift happen. The bigger problem Ino has however, would be that she just doesn't do anything. In Part one she doesn't do a lot, although the two small parts where she *did* do something were... fine i guess. Her coming to Sakuras rescue was a nice touch and her fight with Sakura was... ok i think. But starting Shippuden her first appearences were all comic relief (first the misunderstanding after the Sai fight and then the moment where Sai accidentally makes her a compliment). After this she was completely irrelevant in the Hidan & Kakuzu arc (She didn't fight in the first fight and literally just sat/stood around for the second fight.) only to basically disappear until the Pain vs. Konoha arc where she was yet again just standing/sitting or sometimes at least running around. Then we go back to irrelevancy until their fight with Asuma, which was solely Choji's time to shine (Seriously, we had two arcs, or at least one arc and one sub arc focus on team 10 and she has no character development in those at all). The only kinda interesting part for her was when her dad died and she gave her all to help with the communication between everyone. I know fights and usefulness in combat aren't all when it comes to a character, but personalitywise it was even worse. It felt like she went from \"Sakura-but-blonde\" before their fight to almost no personality at all, up until the very last bits of Shippuden.",

After that, she gave away her position to alert her team of a big incoming attack and then she offered to fight Hidan by herself but Shikamaru rejected the idea because she was their only healer and she had to keep herself protected, which narratively makes sense.\n\nIn the Pain arc she doesn't fight, yes, but she helps figure out how Pain works and where his real body is located. Again, her contributions are more than most others'.\n\nThen in the war she's arguably one of the most important ninja. She is the one to succeed in sealing one of the Kin/Gin bros. She urges her team to fight their sensei alongside her and you may say that the fight is about Choji, but Ino is pulling more than her own weight in that fight, literally fighting in Choji's place until he finds the motivation to fight by himself. Then she saves Naruto/Bee/the rest by possessing Obito and redirecting a Bijuu bomb, and that's before her dad even dies and she has to take his place and run all the communications for the alliance by herself. This puts her above everyone who isn't team 7 and maybe Shikamaru.\n\nSave for Sakura and Tsunade, I don't think there's a female character who's done more in the manga than Ino.",

It's not like the gigantic explosion in front of them was hard to detect, they knew it was coming. She could've easily stayed hidden and waited for an opportunity to attack. Especially with her ability she could've make a huge difference (not that it mattered obviously), but this way she just waisted all that potential. Now it's not like what she did made no sense, but there'd be other ways to have her act in this fight that would've been more interesting.  \n  \nThat said, i gotta say my memories of the war especially were apparently a bit fuzzy. You're right, she did actually do quite a bit more than i remembered and she *does* do a lot more than most of the Konoha rookies.  \n  \nAlso it's not like i think she's an awful character, it's just that she's again a case that gets overshadowed by her teammates. Choji had two pretty great emotional arcs for himself, in the Sasuke rescue arc and again in the war arc and we probably won't have to talk about Shikamaru. Would've just been great to have something more in that direction for her.",

For example it would be way less risky for her to possess Hidan, walk into Shikamaru's trap and then switch back to her body than the scenario that ended up happening, but I think narratively Kishimoto wanted Hidan to be Shikamaru's personal grudge and Kakuzu to be used to showcase rasenshuriken, so there was nothing really left for Ino to do except support, heal and sense.",

They both knew the pain of being outcasts and within the rivalry was another bond of just understanding each other. And then there\u2019s naruto goal of erasing hate and pain and his ultimate target, the one who needs it most and who naruto could never cure it of, was sasuke.\n\nOr that\u2019s how I take it anyway. Still doesn\u2019t make the most sense that he sees sasuke as his \u201cbest friend\u201d when he has someone like Shikamaru and Iruka and everyone in this meme p much",

When Sasuke's life spirals further, Naruto pushes even harder because he recognizes that dark place from when he was young. Iruka helped Naruto out of that pit, Naruto helped Gaara and no matter how long it takes, he's determined to help Sasuke. Sadly, Sasuke's situation is complicated by the ninja world, the Akatsuki's schemes, and Sasuke's own mental health. \n\nThe gay undertones are also a thing though. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

You got Sasuke who was mentally abused and brainwashed by his brother that was a victim of the shinobi system and the other who was essentially born into nothingness, a demon inside of him, and a village who hated him for no reason (not to mention one\u2019s whole clan was massacred and the other\u2019s parents were killed cause of that same system). It makes sense to me how Sasuke would suppress his bond/feelings toward Naruto since he would grow to view it as a weakness in his pursuit for strength to kill his brother. Naruto on the other hand never had bonds and had to make them on his own, albeit in an unhealthy way, but it still makes sense cause he grew up without a family and the opportunity to organically make bonds. Tbh it wouldve been unrealistic imo if they were friendly rivals like guy and kakashi.",

There's just no foundation to it, and I doubt there could ever be, but the worse is there were no shortage of events where the **reasonable** path would be for Naruto to, at the very least, just drop it.\n\nI think it's foolish to expect the \"realistic\" from manga/anime, and that's not why I didn't like this whole thing, it's because it was terribly done. Friendly rivals maybe wasn't the way to go, but I have PTSD whenever the main character has a scuffle with a mate these days \"Please, not another Sasuke. Please, not another Sasuke\"...",

It's sorta like how Gundam is a mecha show, but really it's always majorly invested in politics. MHA is a shonen show, but really it has a big vested interest in things like government agencies, laws, ect.",

Those things exist, but they're hardly ever in the spotlight of the show, and when they are shown in organizations like the Liberation Army or the Yakuza, they're dealt with in a single arc almost immediately. Gundam is a show that is politically complex and intriguing, it asks complex moral questions. MHA is a generic villain-of-the-week type show that struggles with its atttempts at moral complexity. It does attempt it, and in some places i.e. Endeavour it succeeds with flying colors, but in most places the thematic questions the show asks are boring, unimaginative, and simple.",

I know a lot of people that like the anime, which is why I watched it entirely, but I seriously don't get it. Normally something isn't your taste but you can still understand the appeal, yknow?",

Also she's written very realistically; she's a good person at heart but with numerous glaring flaws (like her gambling or alcohol addiction) and she's not a perfect Hokage.\n\nKonan because it's the one instance where a female character being sidelined makes sense (her function and purpose is to be the bridge in the background that supports the main guy). Also because she went out in a way that proved her strength and that she was not just the token girl in a group of super strong ninjas.\n\nIno because she's the only girl who puts friendship above romance. She may not always pass the Bechdel with words, but she certainly passes it with actions (putting Sakura above her feelings for Sasuke numerous times, her platonic bond with Inoshikacho, her love for her father or Asuma etc). Also she's the only female leader of her squad, and she was pretty useful as a character.",

                            "body": "For those who haven't watched all of Shippuden yet (as someone already mentioned): This is gonna contain a lot of spoilers, so beware.\n\n>Tsunade   \n  \nI definitely agree with you on her arc in overcoming her phobia and trauma, this was arguably the best arc for a female character in the whole series. Sadly, once Shippuden arrived she was a pretty wasted character in my opinion. For most of Shippuden she was pretty much downgraded to a Naruto Fan-girl and merely used as a device to make it believable that those in a high position would let Naruto go on - what was from their perspective - suicide-missions. It *did* get better later in the war arc, but her actually interesting flaws never really played a meaningful role again.  \n  \n>Konan  \n  \nGotta have to disagree here. While it did make sense story-wise why she was side-lined, it still, at least to me, felt like she actually *was* the token-female - not only in the Akatsuki, but in her 3-man-squad aswell. Her death was pretty much the only time in the story she made a decision on her own accord and in the end, it didn't even matter (i swear that wasn't a linkin park reference). She was also the only Akatsuki member that had arguably no impact. Was she weak? By no means, but compared to the rest of the Akatsuki i'd say she was about average. But I don't really think that's too relevant. In my opinion the Akatsuki shine because of their personalities and she... just doesn't really have a lot of personality. Jiraiya said she was always kind and that was shown... a bit i think, but aside from that her defining character trait was that she believed in her male companions and that's kinda weak.  \nAlso, not really relevant to this, but the fact that out of 11 members she was the only female is... telling.\n  \n>Kushina  \n\nDefinitely agree. \n  \n>Ino  \n  \nI gotta disagree again. There's only really three characters who have a big focus on romance, Ino, Sakura and Hinata. Yes, Hinata apparently exists only to love Naruto and have him ignore her, even though it makes no sense after Pain, but Sakura in fact shifts quite a lot away from this aswell, especially as of the five Kage summit. And while that shift wasn't really greatly accomplished imo, it does mean Ino isn't really the only one to have this shift happen. The bigger problem Ino has however, would be that she just doesn't do anything. In Part one she doesn't do a lot, although the two small parts where she *did* do something were... fine i guess. Her coming to Sakuras rescue was a nice touch and her fight with Sakura was... ok i think. But starting Shippuden her first appearences were all comic relief (first the misunderstanding after the Sai fight and then the moment where Sai accidentally makes her a compliment). After this she was completely irrelevant in the Hidan & Kakuzu arc (She didn't fight in the first fight and literally just sat/stood around for the second fight.) only to basically disappear until the Pain vs. Konoha arc where she was yet again just standing/sitting or sometimes at least running around. Then we go back to irrelevancy until their fight with Asuma, which was solely Choji's time to shine (Seriously, we had two arcs, or at least one arc and one sub arc focus on team 10 and she has no character development in those at all). The only kinda interesting part for her was when her dad died and she gave her all to help with the communication between everyone. I know fights and usefulness in combat aren't all when it comes to a character, but personalitywise it was even worse. It felt like she went from \"Sakura-but-blonde\" before their fight to almost no personality at all, up until the very last bits of Shippuden.",

After that, she gave away her position to alert her team of a big incoming attack and then she offered to fight Hidan by herself but Shikamaru rejected the idea because she was their only healer and she had to keep herself protected, which narratively makes sense.\n\nIn the Pain arc she doesn't fight, yes, but she helps figure out how Pain works and where his real body is located. Again, her contributions are more than most others'.\n\nThen in the war she's arguably one of the most important ninja. She is the one to succeed in sealing one of the Kin/Gin bros. She urges her team to fight their sensei alongside her and you may say that the fight is about Choji, but Ino is pulling more than her own weight in that fight, literally fighting in Choji's place until he finds the motivation to fight by himself. Then she saves Naruto/Bee/the rest by possessing Obito and redirecting a Bijuu bomb, and that's before her dad even dies and she has to take his place and run all the communications for the alliance by herself. This puts her above everyone who isn't team 7 and maybe Shikamaru.\n\nSave for Sakura and Tsunade, I don't think there's a female character who's done more in the manga than Ino.",

It's not like the gigantic explosion in front of them was hard to detect, they knew it was coming. She could've easily stayed hidden and waited for an opportunity to attack. Especially with her ability she could've make a huge difference (not that it mattered obviously), but this way she just waisted all that potential. Now it's not like what she did made no sense, but there'd be other ways to have her act in this fight that would've been more interesting.  \n  \nThat said, i gotta say my memories of the war especially were apparently a bit fuzzy. You're right, she did actually do quite a bit more than i remembered and she *does* do a lot more than most of the Konoha rookies.  \n  \nAlso it's not like i think she's an awful character, it's just that she's again a case that gets overshadowed by her teammates. Choji had two pretty great emotional arcs for himself, in the Sasuke rescue arc and again in the war arc and we probably won't have to talk about Shikamaru. Would've just been great to have something more in that direction for her.",

For example it would be way less risky for her to possess Hidan, walk into Shikamaru's trap and then switch back to her body than the scenario that ended up happening, but I think narratively Kishimoto wanted Hidan to be Shikamaru's personal grudge and Kakuzu to be used to showcase rasenshuriken, so there was nothing really left for Ino to do except support, heal and sense.",

You got Sasuke who was mentally abused and brainwashed by his brother that was a victim of the shinobi system and the other who was essentially born into nothingness, a demon inside of him, and a village who hated him for no reason (not to mention one\u2019s whole clan was massacred and the other\u2019s parents were killed cause of that same system). It makes sense to me how Sasuke would suppress his bond/feelings toward Naruto since he would grow to view it as a weakness in his pursuit for strength to kill his brother. Naruto on the other hand never had bonds and had to make them on his own, albeit in an unhealthy way, but it still makes sense cause he grew up without a family and the opportunity to organically make bonds. Tbh it wouldve been unrealistic imo if they were friendly rivals like guy and kakashi.",

There's just no foundation to it, and I doubt there could ever be, but the worse is there were no shortage of events where the **reasonable** path would be for Naruto to, at the very least, just drop it.\n\nI think it's foolish to expect the \"realistic\" from manga/anime, and that's not why I didn't like this whole thing, it's because it was terribly done. Friendly rivals maybe wasn't the way to go, but I have PTSD whenever the main character has a scuffle with a mate these days \"Please, not another Sasuke. Please, not another Sasuke\"...",

Those things exist, but they're hardly ever in the spotlight of the show, and when they are shown in organizations like the Liberation Army or the Yakuza, they're dealt with in a single arc almost immediately. Gundam is a show that is politically complex and intriguing, it asks complex moral questions. MHA is a generic villain-of-the-week type show that struggles with its atttempts at moral complexity. It does attempt it, and in some places i.e. Endeavour it succeeds with flying colors, but in most places the thematic questions the show asks are boring, unimaginative, and simple.",

Also she's written very realistically; she's a good person at heart but with numerous glaring flaws (like her gambling or alcohol addiction) and she's not a perfect Hokage.\n\nKonan because it's the one instance where a female character being sidelined makes sense (her function and purpose is to be the bridge in the background that supports the main guy). Also because she went out in a way that proved her strength and that she was not just the token girl in a group of super strong ninjas.\n\nIno because she's the only girl who puts friendship above romance. She may not always pass the Bechdel with words, but she certainly passes it with actions (putting Sakura above her feelings for Sasuke numerous times, her platonic bond with Inoshikacho, her love for her father or Asuma etc). Also she's the only female leader of her squad, and she was pretty useful as a character.",

                    "body": "For those who haven't watched all of Shippuden yet (as someone already mentioned): This is gonna contain a lot of spoilers, so beware.\n\n>Tsunade   \n  \nI definitely agree with you on her arc in overcoming her phobia and trauma, this was arguably the best arc for a female character in the whole series. Sadly, once Shippuden arrived she was a pretty wasted character in my opinion. For most of Shippuden she was pretty much downgraded to a Naruto Fan-girl and merely used as a device to make it believable that those in a high position would let Naruto go on - what was from their perspective - suicide-missions. It *did* get better later in the war arc, but her actually interesting flaws never really played a meaningful role again.  \n  \n>Konan  \n  \nGotta have to disagree here. While it did make sense story-wise why she was side-lined, it still, at least to me, felt like she actually *was* the token-female - not only in the Akatsuki, but in her 3-man-squad aswell. Her death was pretty much the only time in the story she made a decision on her own accord and in the end, it didn't even matter (i swear that wasn't a linkin park reference). She was also the only Akatsuki member that had arguably no impact. Was she weak? By no means, but compared to the rest of the Akatsuki i'd say she was about average. But I don't really think that's too relevant. In my opinion the Akatsuki shine because of their personalities and she... just doesn't really have a lot of personality. Jiraiya said she was always kind and that was shown... a bit i think, but aside from that her defining character trait was that she believed in her male companions and that's kinda weak.  \nAlso, not really relevant to this, but the fact that out of 11 members she was the only female is... telling.\n  \n>Kushina  \n\nDefinitely agree. \n  \n>Ino  \n  \nI gotta disagree again. There's only really three characters who have a big focus on romance, Ino, Sakura and Hinata. Yes, Hinata apparently exists only to love Naruto and have him ignore her, even though it makes no sense after Pain, but Sakura in fact shifts quite a lot away from this aswell, especially as of the five Kage summit. And while that shift wasn't really greatly accomplished imo, it does mean Ino isn't really the only one to have this shift happen. The bigger problem Ino has however, would be that she just doesn't do anything. In Part one she doesn't do a lot, although the two small parts where she *did* do something were... fine i guess. Her coming to Sakuras rescue was a nice touch and her fight with Sakura was... ok i think. But starting Shippuden her first appearences were all comic relief (first the misunderstanding after the Sai fight and then the moment where Sai accidentally makes her a compliment). After this she was completely irrelevant in the Hidan & Kakuzu arc (She didn't fight in the first fight and literally just sat/stood around for the second fight.) only to basically disappear until the Pain vs. Konoha arc where she was yet again just standing/sitting or sometimes at least running around. Then we go back to irrelevancy until their fight with Asuma, which was solely Choji's time to shine (Seriously, we had two arcs, or at least one arc and one sub arc focus on team 10 and she has no character development in those at all). The only kinda interesting part for her was when her dad died and she gave her all to help with the communication between everyone. I know fights and usefulness in combat aren't all when it comes to a character, but personalitywise it was even worse. It felt like she went from \"Sakura-but-blonde\" before their fight to almost no personality at all, up until the very last bits of Shippuden.",

After that, she gave away her position to alert her team of a big incoming attack and then she offered to fight Hidan by herself but Shikamaru rejected the idea because she was their only healer and she had to keep herself protected, which narratively makes sense.\n\nIn the Pain arc she doesn't fight, yes, but she helps figure out how Pain works and where his real body is located. Again, her contributions are more than most others'.\n\nThen in the war she's arguably one of the most important ninja. She is the one to succeed in sealing one of the Kin/Gin bros. She urges her team to fight their sensei alongside her and you may say that the fight is about Choji, but Ino is pulling more than her own weight in that fight, literally fighting in Choji's place until he finds the motivation to fight by himself. Then she saves Naruto/Bee/the rest by possessing Obito and redirecting a Bijuu bomb, and that's before her dad even dies and she has to take his place and run all the communications for the alliance by herself. This puts her above everyone who isn't team 7 and maybe Shikamaru.\n\nSave for Sakura and Tsunade, I don't think there's a female character who's done more in the manga than Ino.",

It's not like the gigantic explosion in front of them was hard to detect, they knew it was coming. She could've easily stayed hidden and waited for an opportunity to attack. Especially with her ability she could've make a huge difference (not that it mattered obviously), but this way she just waisted all that potential. Now it's not like what she did made no sense, but there'd be other ways to have her act in this fight that would've been more interesting.  \n  \nThat said, i gotta say my memories of the war especially were apparently a bit fuzzy. You're right, she did actually do quite a bit more than i remembered and she *does* do a lot more than most of the Konoha rookies.  \n  \nAlso it's not like i think she's an awful character, it's just that she's again a case that gets overshadowed by her teammates. Choji had two pretty great emotional arcs for himself, in the Sasuke rescue arc and again in the war arc and we probably won't have to talk about Shikamaru. Would've just been great to have something more in that direction for her.",

For example it would be way less risky for her to possess Hidan, walk into Shikamaru's trap and then switch back to her body than the scenario that ended up happening, but I think narratively Kishimoto wanted Hidan to be Shikamaru's personal grudge and Kakuzu to be used to showcase rasenshuriken, so there was nothing really left for Ino to do except support, heal and sense.",

Those things exist, but they're hardly ever in the spotlight of the show, and when they are shown in organizations like the Liberation Army or the Yakuza, they're dealt with in a single arc almost immediately. Gundam is a show that is politically complex and intriguing, it asks complex moral questions. MHA is a generic villain-of-the-week type show that struggles with its atttempts at moral complexity. It does attempt it, and in some places i.e. Endeavour it succeeds with flying colors, but in most places the thematic questions the show asks are boring, unimaginative, and simple.",

Not to mention if we're talking about thematic consistency, the \"theme\" if you can call it that of MHA's starting premise is literally betrayed in the first two episodes by the MC receiving the most OP super power in the entire series.

I know a lot of people that like the anime, which is why I watched it entirely, but I seriously don't get it. Normally something isn't your taste but you can still understand the appeal, yknow?",

            "body": "For those who haven't watched all of Shippuden yet (as someone already mentioned): This is gonna contain a lot of spoilers, so beware.\n\n>Tsunade   \n  \nI definitely agree with you on her arc in overcoming her phobia and trauma, this was arguably the best arc for a female character in the whole series. Sadly, once Shippuden arrived she was a pretty wasted character in my opinion. For most of Shippuden she was pretty much downgraded to a Naruto Fan-girl and merely used as a device to make it believable that those in a high position would let Naruto go on - what was from their perspective - suicide-missions. It *did* get better later in the war arc, but her actually interesting flaws never really played a meaningful role again.  \n  \n>Konan  \n  \nGotta have to disagree here. While it did make sense story-wise why she was side-lined, it still, at least to me, felt like she actually *was* the token-female - not only in the Akatsuki, but in her 3-man-squad aswell. Her death was pretty much the only time in the story she made a decision on her own accord and in the end, it didn't even matter (i swear that wasn't a linkin park reference). She was also the only Akatsuki member that had arguably no impact. Was she weak? By no means, but compared to the rest of the Akatsuki i'd say she was about average. But I don't really think that's too relevant. In my opinion the Akatsuki shine because of their personalities and she... just doesn't really have a lot of personality. Jiraiya said she was always kind and that was shown... a bit i think, but aside from that her defining character trait was that she believed in her male companions and that's kinda weak.  \nAlso, not really relevant to this, but the fact that out of 11 members she was the only female is... telling.\n  \n>Kushina  \n\nDefinitely agree. \n  \n>Ino  \n  \nI gotta disagree again. There's only really three characters who have a big focus on romance, Ino, Sakura and Hinata. Yes, Hinata apparently exists only to love Naruto and have him ignore her, even though it makes no sense after Pain, but Sakura in fact shifts quite a lot away from this aswell, especially as of the five Kage summit. And while that shift wasn't really greatly accomplished imo, it does mean Ino isn't really the only one to have this shift happen. The bigger problem Ino has however, would be that she just doesn't do anything. In Part one she doesn't do a lot, although the two small parts where she *did* do something were... fine i guess. Her coming to Sakuras rescue was a nice touch and her fight with Sakura was... ok i think. But starting Shippuden her first appearences were all comic relief (first the misunderstanding after the Sai fight and then the moment where Sai accidentally makes her a compliment). After this she was completely irrelevant in the Hidan & Kakuzu arc (She didn't fight in the first fight and literally just sat/stood around for the second fight.) only to basically disappear until the Pain vs. Konoha arc where she was yet again just standing/sitting or sometimes at least running around. Then we go back to irrelevancy until their fight with Asuma, which was solely Choji's time to shine (Seriously, we had two arcs, or at least one arc and one sub arc focus on team 10 and she has no character development in those at all). The only kinda interesting part for her was when her dad died and she gave her all to help with the communication between everyone. I know fights and usefulness in combat aren't all when it comes to a character, but personalitywise it was even worse. It felt like she went from \"Sakura-but-blonde\" before their fight to almost no personality at all, up until the very last bits of Shippuden.",

                    "body": "While I do see your point about Konan being described as just \"kind\" which is very standard for girls in Naruto, I think we'll have to agree to disagree on Ino.\n\nYour main argument against her seems to be that she doesn't do much, but arguably she does more than most side characters in Naruto.\n\nIn the Hidan & Kakuzu arc, time was of the essence when it comes to killing Hidan/Kakuzu and without Ino they would not have been able to pinpoint the location of the immortal duo in time.  After that, she gave away her position to alert her team of a big incoming attack and then she offered to fight Hidan by herself but Shikamaru rejected the idea because she was their only healer and she had to keep herself protected, which narratively makes sense.\n\nIn the Pain arc she doesn't fight, yes, but she helps figure out how Pain works and where his real body is located. Again, her contributions are more than most others'.\n\nThen in the war she's arguably one of the most important ninja. She is the one to succeed in sealing one of the Kin/Gin bros. She urges her team to fight their sensei alongside her and you may say that the fight is about Choji, but Ino is pulling more than her own weight in that fight, literally fighting in Choji's place until he finds the motivation to fight by himself. Then she saves Naruto/Bee/the rest by possessing Obito and redirecting a Bijuu bomb, and that's before her dad even dies and she has to take his place and run all the communications for the alliance by herself. This puts her above everyone who isn't team 7 and maybe Shikamaru.\n\nSave for Sakura and Tsunade, I don't think there's a female character who's done more in the manga than Ino.",

It's not like the gigantic explosion in front of them was hard to detect, they knew it was coming. She could've easily stayed hidden and waited for an opportunity to attack. Especially with her ability she could've make a huge difference (not that it mattered obviously), but this way she just waisted all that potential. Now it's not like what she did made no sense, but there'd be other ways to have her act in this fight that would've been more interesting.  \n  \nThat said, i gotta say my memories of the war especially were apparently a bit fuzzy. You're right, she did actually do quite a bit more than i remembered and she *does* do a lot more than most of the Konoha rookies.  \n  \nAlso it's not like i think she's an awful character, it's just that she's again a case that gets overshadowed by her teammates. Choji had two pretty great emotional arcs for himself, in the Sasuke rescue arc and again in the war arc and we probably won't have to talk about Shikamaru. Would've just been great to have something more in that direction for her.",

For example it would be way less risky for her to possess Hidan, walk into Shikamaru's trap and then switch back to her body than the scenario that ended up happening, but I think narratively Kishimoto wanted Hidan to be Shikamaru's personal grudge and Kakuzu to be used to showcase rasenshuriken, so there was nothing really left for Ino to do except support, heal and sense.",

Those things exist, but they're hardly ever in the spotlight of the show, and when they are shown in organizations like the Liberation Army or the Yakuza, they're dealt with in a single arc almost immediately. Gundam is a show that is politically complex and intriguing, it asks complex moral questions. MHA is a generic villain-of-the-week type show that struggles with its atttempts at moral complexity. It does attempt it, and in some places i.e. Endeavour it succeeds with flying colors, but in most places the thematic questions the show asks are boring, unimaginative, and simple.",

After that, she gave away her position to alert her team of a big incoming attack and then she offered to fight Hidan by herself but Shikamaru rejected the idea because she was their only healer and she had to keep herself protected, which narratively makes sense.\n\nIn the Pain arc she doesn't fight, yes, but she helps figure out how Pain works and where his real body is located. Again, her contributions are more than most others'.\n\nThen in the war she's arguably one of the most important ninja. She is the one to succeed in sealing one of the Kin/Gin bros. She urges her team to fight their sensei alongside her and you may say that the fight is about Choji, but Ino is pulling more than her own weight in that fight, literally fighting in Choji's place until he finds the motivation to fight by himself. Then she saves Naruto/Bee/the rest by possessing Obito and redirecting a Bijuu bomb, and that's before her dad even dies and she has to take his place and run all the communications for the alliance by herself. This puts her above everyone who isn't team 7 and maybe Shikamaru.\n\nSave for Sakura and Tsunade, I don't think there's a female character who's done more in the manga than Ino.",

                    "body": "> After that, she gave away her position to alert her team of a big incoming attack  \n  \nTo be honest, this was just very stupid back then. It's not like the gigantic explosion in front of them was hard to detect, they knew it was coming. She could've easily stayed hidden and waited for an opportunity to attack. Especially with her ability she could've make a huge difference (not that it mattered obviously), but this way she just waisted all that potential. Now it's not like what she did made no sense, but there'd be other ways to have her act in this fight that would've been more interesting.  \n  \nThat said, i gotta say my memories of the war especially were apparently a bit fuzzy. You're right, she did actually do quite a bit more than i remembered and she *does* do a lot more than most of the Konoha rookies.  \n  \nAlso it's not like i think she's an awful character, it's just that she's again a case that gets overshadowed by her teammates. Choji had two pretty great emotional arcs for himself, in the Sasuke rescue arc and again in the war arc and we probably won't have to talk about Shikamaru. Would've just been great to have something more in that direction for her.",

For example it would be way less risky for her to possess Hidan, walk into Shikamaru's trap and then switch back to her body than the scenario that ended up happening, but I think narratively Kishimoto wanted Hidan to be Shikamaru's personal grudge and Kakuzu to be used to showcase rasenshuriken, so there was nothing really left for Ino to do except support, heal and sense.",

Those things exist, but they're hardly ever in the spotlight of the show, and when they are shown in organizations like the Liberation Army or the Yakuza, they're dealt with in a single arc almost immediately. Gundam is a show that is politically complex and intriguing, it asks complex moral questions. MHA is a generic villain-of-the-week type show that struggles with its atttempts at moral complexity. It does attempt it, and in some places i.e. Endeavour it succeeds with flying colors, but in most places the thematic questions the show asks are boring, unimaginative, and simple.",

It's not like the gigantic explosion in front of them was hard to detect, they knew it was coming. She could've easily stayed hidden and waited for an opportunity to attack. Especially with her ability she could've make a huge difference (not that it mattered obviously), but this way she just waisted all that potential. Now it's not like what she did made no sense, but there'd be other ways to have her act in this fight that would've been more interesting.  \n  \nThat said, i gotta say my memories of the war especially were apparently a bit fuzzy. You're right, she did actually do quite a bit more than i remembered and she *does* do a lot more than most of the Konoha rookies.  \n  \nAlso it's not like i think she's an awful character, it's just that she's again a case that gets overshadowed by her teammates. Choji had two pretty great emotional arcs for himself, in the Sasuke rescue arc and again in the war arc and we probably won't have to talk about Shikamaru.
