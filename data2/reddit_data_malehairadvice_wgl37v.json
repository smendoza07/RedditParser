I don\u2019t think that fairly conservative cut goes with pink all that well, but you do you, dude. Don\u2019t let these mfs tell you it\u2019s beyond repair",

I\u2019m assuming the second photo is what you wanted but what many people don\u2019t realize is that you can\u2019t just supply a photo of someone else with a different head shape, hair style, and hair care routine and expect to get the same results. For starters, barbers tend to deal with shorter cuts anyways, you should have went to a salon or beautician and they would have been able to help layer your sides to ease into the length on top. Secondly, I can tell by the texture of your hair that even if you got the length and cut you wanted, it still wouldn\u2019t have been the same, it probably would have been better but I don\u2019t think you would have been satisfied. Never go into any hair cutting place with a picture, they absolutely hate that and it\u2019s not a real expectation",
