    "body": "I was sitting there on the hotel bed, naked, except for a very large medallion of a pitbull. Trust me, I had good reason to be wearing it. It completed the look I was going for.  My sb was on top of me, wearing my shirt. We were waiting for room service to bring some ice cream, but they took too long. So my sb said she would just go down to the lobby store and buy some. She put on my pants and left. \n#\nAfter a while, I get this phone call. She didn't bring a room key, so she can't use the elevator to get back up. But.... she is wearing my clothes. I look around the room. I am not going down there wearing sheets. Just saying. If my pasty white ass gets shot to death wearing a sheet while pulling some pretty brown skinned girl into an elevator, you have my permission to vote not guilty at the trial of whoever killed me, even when it turns out I was just a nerd with limited clothing options, and not a Klan member.\n#\nMy sb needs me, so I man up and put her dress on. I'm a scrawny dude, so it works. I had to take my boxers off though, because the dress didn't go down far enough to cover them, and it would have looked ridiculous to keep them on. Don't worry, I'm not huge, so there wasn't much dangling action. More like, a tasteful liberty bell effect, than a full on lampshade and pull cord, ya know?\n#\nI grab a bottle of wine, since the elevators are slow, and head out. I tried to explain to the people in the elevator: \"It's not what you think; my girl took my clothes.\" I don't think they believed me. When I got to the lobby, I can honestly say it's been a long time since I was able to shock my sb like this. She said: \"Why didn't you use one of the hotel bathrobes?\"  That was an outstanding idea that sober me probably would have thought of.\n#\nWe get back up to my floor, and of course, the room service guy is there. He sees my hairy chest, wine drinking ass walk up, and looks at me like he is either trying not to puke, or questioning his sexuality. I could not tell which it was, but it was definitely one if those. I see looks like that all the time when girls see me naked, sometimes simultaneously.\n#\nIf you work at the Dream Hollywood, and recently became gay, that's my bad homie. I didn't mean to be such a tease. I hope the big tip helped. I mean the money I added to the bill, not whatever you saw below my dress.",
