    "body": "So when it comes to gifts, I'm a practical woman. I like and want things that I can use, or eat, or wear frequently (and not just on *\"special occasions.\")*\n\n(Practical gifts like electronic gadgets, app subscriptions, shoes, staple clothing items, or timeless jewelry and or accessories for my wardrobe, winter jackets -- the Moncler jacket that was linked! Okay, maybe not that one because who needs that in California -- a wad of cash, or a preloaded Visa card to pay for things at my own choosing, etc. would be the best types of things IMO)\n\nWhile I \\*love\\* lingerie and love wearing them, I don't view them as gifts **FOR ME**. It's gifts that he gives FOR HIM to enjoy me. If it's lingerie, or sex toys, or whatever sexy thing that he and I would be using during our sexy times, it's a gift *FOR HIM/US.*\n\nOf course, lingerie and sex toy types of gifts are appreciated - with a thank you and a smile. But deep down, I wish there are gifts JUST FOR ME as well.\n\n**Practical gifts - just for me - are gifts that truly make me wet, I mean, appreciate.**\n\nAm I the only woman / SB who feels this way??!",

She reviewed many past gifts that actually included sexy items (long time ago).  Mostly bosses just took their assistants to a nice lunch.\n\nHer suggestion was to skip the boss-secretary lunch and instead just pay for a lunch of their choosing.  In other words, flip them the credit card and pray.   Ever since, that has been my preferred gift.  And I get great reviews.\n\nHints help!",

We went once and it\u2019s just awkward during covid when hardly anyone else is in the store and the sales associate listening in on everything.  After that failure, he asked me to pick a style I liked from a website, but I think he prefers the tacky porn star styles (think cupless bras / teddies & crotchless panties) so now he just picks himself.  I mean it\u2019s better than getting nothing and if it turns him on, sure I\u2019ll wear it.  I mean it is kinda hot, but it\u2019s just not really a gift I view that\u2019s really for me and it makes me feel like a 100% sex object.  I guess that\u2019s part of the SB role though. \n\nHave yet to be taken handbag or shoe shopping, maybe some day!  I should send him to take SD lessons from you lol",

I have seen dozens of SDs posting here saying how good those gifts made them feel. It\u2019s difficult to buy a gift for a man who can buy anything he wants, so hand made and sentimental stuff is great! That\u2019s the common consensus. I don\u2019t see how you\u2019d consider those gifts not **for you.** Sure, she felt good giving it. It should always feel good to give a gift; that isn\u2019t the same as giving someone a gift because it\u2019s self serving (lingerie/sex toys etc.) like discussed in the post. \n\nHowever, I agree that doing sexy things/dressing up/getting sexy gifts for a SD is perfect! I have absolutely no issues with the list you wrote in parentheses. \n\nSo, I\u2019m not sure if your comment was intended to make fun of the OP, or not, but I wanted to chime in with that anyway.

I'd like my SB to be appreciative regardless; but I have no illusions as to why I bought that specific lingerie, and who might enjoy it more.  I don't really consider this some largesse on my part.\n\nThat said, one basic correction:  I can go to Frederick's or even Wicked Temptations, and find some item that looks dirty and slutty and is at least as much of a turn on as anything I could find on Agent Provocateur at literally a tenth the price.  To the extent an SB is specifically asking for AP (or you get the idea -- any higher end lingerie), that's the extent to which the lingerie is for her.  I could easily spend $100 or less on any particular lingerie and experience everything I love about lingerie; if you ask me to spend nearly an order of magnitude more, that's definitely at least partially for you.",

It\u2019s difficult to buy a gift for a man who can buy anything he wants, so hand made and sentimental stuff is great! That\u2019s the common consensus. I don\u2019t see how you\u2019d consider those gifts not **for you.** Sure, she felt good giving it. It should always feel good to give a gift; that isn\u2019t the same as giving someone a gift because it\u2019s self serving (lingerie/sex toys etc.) like discussed in the post. \n\nHowever, I agree that doing sexy things/dressing up/getting sexy gifts for a SD is perfect! I have absolutely no issues with the list you wrote in parentheses. \n\nSo, I\u2019m not sure if your comment was intended to make fun of the OP, or not, but I wanted to chime in with that anyway. Edit: didn\u2019t see the username at first, and now I\u2019m 99.9% positive you were being condescending.",

After that failure, he asked me to pick a style I liked from a website, but I think he prefers the tacky porn star styles (think cupless bras / teddies & crotchless panties) so now he just picks himself.  I mean it\u2019s better than getting nothing and if it turns him on, sure I\u2019ll wear it.  I mean it is kinda hot, but it\u2019s just not really a gift I view that\u2019s really for me and it makes me feel like a 100% sex object.  I guess that\u2019s part of the SB role though. \n\nHave yet to be taken handbag or shoe shopping, maybe some day!  I should send him to take SD lessons from you lol",
