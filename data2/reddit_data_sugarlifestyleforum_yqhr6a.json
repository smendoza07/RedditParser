    "body": "So I\u2019ve been seeing this guy I meet off seeking for roughly 6 weeks. Allowance is decent, he\u2019s super sweet and loves animals just like me however I feel he is too horny for me. I\u2019ve been sugaring for about 2 years now and I pick and choose what I can tolerate and unfortunately he\u2019s just not that tolerable due to his poor shape and overall appearance. However money is decent and personality is on point but he\u2019s so hard to be around and literally takes up my entire afternoon. I just found out the reason he\u2019s able to go non stop (like 3 hrs plus) is because he doesn\u2019t lose his erection after ejaculation which is impressive\u2026 but not when you\u2019re not pulling out. It\u2019s disgusting I had no clue he was doing that the entire time and then he goes \u201cit keeps lubrication\u201d when I asked him if he\u2019d been doing that the whole time without my permission just made me want to gag in that moment cause I don\u2019t find him very attractive. I\u2019m on birth control and we\u2019re both clean but I still found that pretty gross. Plus he sweats way too much and wants me to cuddle with him in the sweat puddle. So gross to me the conversations are good until the sex comes. It makes me feel like I\u2019m rather working a job I don\u2019t want to work. He\u2019s 52 years old and prob thought it would be okay to leave it in because he got fixed however it\u2019s gross, it\u2019s runny and made me feel icky. that just turned me completely off so now I\u2019m debating on cutting him off and brainwashing him out of my memory but I\u2019d feel bad cause he\u2019s kind of obsessed With me in a way and it\u2019s hard to find a sugar daddy that gives decent monthly allowance.",

Personal recommendation is that if you don't think you will assess the relationship as \" it was crazy but it was a good thing for me \"  it is probably time to say adios.  \n\nI'm probably far from alone in having met and dated wonderful women who were handicapped by the wounds of prior relationships to the extent that they had difficulty with relationships decades later. \n\nIt's  somewhat related to some of the best flying advice I ever received...\"Pinot, before doing something think about how stupid it might  sound in the accident report if it does not turn out well.\"\n\nThere's stuff that sounds dangerous but is really not and stuff that looks benign that is potentially very damaging",

I never denied the fact that he could not turn me on what\u2019s so ever but he did gross me out once i made that discovery He is a 52 year old man with a vasectomy his semen is literally clear and he shoots out the smallest amount at a time it had to build up for me to finally notice it isn\u2019t just my lubrication. Either way to the rejected sugar daddies don\u2019t project your feelings onto me. It\u2019s gross cumming inside a woman with no warning period, fertile or not it\u2019s far from sanitary and messes with your PH. This man and I discussed this through text I literally broke it down to him when he asked why when he first met so he knows I didn\u2019t want his semen in me. If that wasn\u2019t the case I wouldn\u2019t feel grossed out and violated. How about instead of pointing fingers and assuming I\u2019m financially hurting and desperate put yourself in a women\u2019s shoes. It\u2019s more than disrespect what that creep did to me doesn\u2019t matter how you put it. It did nothing but remind me that how i felt didn\u2019t matter. He\u2019s able to control himself and chose not to so for that very reason I\u2019m disgusted and want nothing else to do with him. I\u2019m a people\u2019s pleaser unintentionally due to being raped in several ways several times in my adolescent years (this also explains my ability to disassociate so well) It\u2019s not always easy for me to confront people about their wrong doings cause somewhere in my head I feel like I\u2019ve done something wrong. So i just blocked him and won\u2019t be speaking to him again Hence why I got on here to vent about it but I do appreciate all women backing me and to the salty daddies how\u2019s about try not to be so gross. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re paying for it, I was pushing it by letting him in without a condom because he provided updated paper work prior to us meeting. That was my silly mistake but I can\u2019t control how that sick creep translated clean results and birth control = cum inside \ud83e\udd22",
