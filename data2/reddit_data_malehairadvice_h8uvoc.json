Are they short or are they the same length as the top?\n\nIf you insist on going shorter, maybe try going for an off center part hairstyle like [this](https://ibb.co/jDn2CKJ) This style is trending now and they especially good with people that have your face shape. With your face shape, I wouldn\u2019t go too short with your hairstyle. \n\nFor the beard, maybe trim it down to a stubble and get the lines crisp like [this](https://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Stubble-Beards-50-650x650.jpg). That beard is lined up but still looks natural as opposed to [this.](https://images.app.goo.gl/pLGfJcLwRgGQjZxQ9) LOL\n\nPS: a lot of the suggestions that people are giving are shorter hairstyles and, while they aren\u2019t wrong, you have really healthy looking hair that a lot of guys try to get. Focus your hairstyle around that and keep it longer\n\nJust a suggestion. Good luck brother! Let me know what you decide to go with!",
