I've watched the whole series and even recommended it to a lot of friends but most people aren't willing to watch it when they hear it's 700+ ep. Even if you cut out the filler, it's still over 400 atleast.\n\nBut I'm just wondering if Naruto Kai still manages to fit in all the important moments. It's only 92 ep right? Does it have all the fights? All the touching interactions? What about the flashbacks that are necessary for the plot - like Kakashi and Obito's stories, Minato and Kushina backstory etc?\n\nI want to know if Naruto Kai is worth recommending.",

Iruka had a big ass shuriken sticking out of his back and it gave the show a dark edge/art style that really resonated with me. It really felt like someone could get offed at any time. \n\nThis goes directly into naruto/sasuke rivalry and meeting kakashi, which you didn\u2019t know what to think after letting the eraser prank get him. The bell test expanded the knowledge of the jutsu rules and kakashi\u2019s skills as well as the skill gap naruto needs to overcome. \n\nThis goes directly into the land of waves arc, which set in stone how much I will always love the show. You get a feel for sasuke\u2019s skills and get a morsel of information about narutos chakra capabilities. Zabuza\u2019s appearance put real fear into the characters and I had no idea how they\u2019d persevere. Kakashi\u2019s reveal of the sharingan was awesome and sasuke\u2019s obvious surprise at how he could even have one added a lot of mystery. Top 3 moment for me is naruto retrieving his headband leading to the teamwork with sasuke and the awesome shot of him peering through the demon wind shuriken. \n\nI could go on and on but to me, og naruto is dark, humorous at times, does a great job of world building and shows very interesting teamwork/strategy (shikamaru any scene, sasuke retrieval arc especially). The side characters were very interesting and relevant. Shippuden has the akatsuki which was extremely interesting but seems to drag its feet at times and I feel that it\u2019s missing that element of teamwork and camaraderie that I loved from the original as well as the darker art style. It\u2019s all preference and I\u2019m biased. Naruto surprising people with overcoming all obstacles in the original was very satisfying to me as well. \n\nA bit of a ramble and not even half of what I could write but there\u2019s some of the reasoning and thought process of why I love the original over shippuden and think it\u2019s more rewatchable",

Was my favorite show as a whole for quite a long time, until I started watching One Piece lol. I get what you're saying about the dark themes and whatnot, but I personally feel that it's a little contrived at times, like it takes itself too seriously... After all it's not truly grim and gruesome like some series, like AoT. Which is totally fine, it just kinda pulls me out from the immersion. You got a good point about the cameraderie thing, not as much of it in shippuden - it's the Naruto Sasuke show. Which I think is honestly where most of my enjoyment of the series comes from anyway, so that's probably where our different opinions reside",

I adore it, but unfortunately some people label that as 'filler' and then go around saying the show is ass or not as good as it could be simply because its different. Its understandable that those people would like Boruto less because it is different from Naruto, but that doesn't mean Boruto is bad it just means maybe its not for that specific person. But in my eyes its absolutely perfect. Filler and all. I love the slice of life, I love seeing new characters develop, I love seeing small things be explored for a change instead of the same people and jutsu everytime. Boruto is not a bad show, its being written by the same geniuses that wrote Naruto.",

The anime get some deserved hate from a Naruto fanbase who liked the more dark and traumatic parts of Naruto, which Boruto doesn't have. (for example, in the latest anime episode, I cussed at the screen because of Boruto's naivete and (as his opponent said) spoiled attitude when it comes to fighting). Also, the slice of life stuff in the Boruto anime is very uninteresting to a major part of the Naruto fandom. Slice of life in a small nation is interesting. But stuff like the ChoCho arc? Disgusting and boring. I think most haters/naruto fans of that spectrum (including myself) should read the Boruto manga. There, his early development is much like Naruto's, and afterwards he is much more mature and much less naive. It is also generally darker and more deserving of calling itself a sequel to Naruto. So...read the manga, people, and screw the anime!",

As a legacy series, people want a show that builds on either the whole world or a very specific part of the world (likely one we haven't seen before like how burn the Witch kind of did) and how the previous characters are effected by this, but Boruto from what I saw takes that to far. We no longer have the gritty world of Naruto, but a world were anyone that challenges the leaf has 2 God killers to deal with, so everything feels unimportant. I personally always think that Boruto should have been setup more like Jojo part 2, where a generation has been skipped and things could easily have been lost and found during a new mystery period like all that time we had prior to Naruto being born, not to mention it would be a more effective way to reset the power scaling rather than starting Boruto off like this is new game +",

Iruka had a big ass shuriken sticking out of his back and it gave the show a dark edge/art style that really resonated with me. It really felt like someone could get offed at any time. \n\nThis goes directly into naruto/sasuke rivalry and meeting kakashi, which you didn\u2019t know what to think after letting the eraser prank get him. The bell test expanded the knowledge of the jutsu rules and kakashi\u2019s skills as well as the skill gap naruto needs to overcome. \n\nThis goes directly into the land of waves arc, which set in stone how much I will always love the show. You get a feel for sasuke\u2019s skills and get a morsel of information about narutos chakra capabilities. Zabuza\u2019s appearance put real fear into the characters and I had no idea how they\u2019d persevere. Kakashi\u2019s reveal of the sharingan was awesome and sasuke\u2019s obvious surprise at how he could even have one added a lot of mystery. Top 3 moment for me is naruto retrieving his headband leading to the teamwork with sasuke and the awesome shot of him peering through the demon wind shuriken. \n\nI could go on and on but to me, og naruto is dark, humorous at times, does a great job of world building and shows very interesting teamwork/strategy (shikamaru any scene, sasuke retrieval arc especially). The side characters were very interesting and relevant. Shippuden has the akatsuki which was extremely interesting but seems to drag its feet at times and I feel that it\u2019s missing that element of teamwork and camaraderie that I loved from the original as well as the darker art style. It\u2019s all preference and I\u2019m biased. Naruto surprising people with overcoming all obstacles in the original was very satisfying to me as well. \n\nA bit of a ramble and not even half of what I could write but there\u2019s some of the reasoning and thought process of why I love the original over shippuden and think it\u2019s more rewatchable",

Was my favorite show as a whole for quite a long time, until I started watching One Piece lol. I get what you're saying about the dark themes and whatnot, but I personally feel that it's a little contrived at times, like it takes itself too seriously... After all it's not truly grim and gruesome like some series, like AoT. Which is totally fine, it just kinda pulls me out from the immersion. You got a good point about the cameraderie thing, not as much of it in shippuden - it's the Naruto Sasuke show. Which I think is honestly where most of my enjoyment of the series comes from anyway, so that's probably where our different opinions reside",

Not all our beloved characters will become as strong as Naruto and Sasuke during all those years because everyone's journey is different and peacetime will definitely dull any of their senses after being constantly at war since birth.",

Some people see that as boring and I can understand why, but for me just seeing something completely new is its own reward and I've loved every step of the way. I love a slice of life ninja show.

Iruka had a big ass shuriken sticking out of his back and it gave the show a dark edge/art style that really resonated with me. It really felt like someone could get offed at any time. \n\nThis goes directly into naruto/sasuke rivalry and meeting kakashi, which you didn\u2019t know what to think after letting the eraser prank get him. The bell test expanded the knowledge of the jutsu rules and kakashi\u2019s skills as well as the skill gap naruto needs to overcome. \n\nThis goes directly into the land of waves arc, which set in stone how much I will always love the show. You get a feel for sasuke\u2019s skills and get a morsel of information about narutos chakra capabilities. Zabuza\u2019s appearance put real fear into the characters and I had no idea how they\u2019d persevere. Kakashi\u2019s reveal of the sharingan was awesome and sasuke\u2019s obvious surprise at how he could even have one added a lot of mystery. Top 3 moment for me is naruto retrieving his headband leading to the teamwork with sasuke and the awesome shot of him peering through the demon wind shuriken. \n\nI could go on and on but to me, og naruto is dark, humorous at times, does a great job of world building and shows very interesting teamwork/strategy (shikamaru any scene, sasuke retrieval arc especially). The side characters were very interesting and relevant. Shippuden has the akatsuki which was extremely interesting but seems to drag its feet at times and I feel that it\u2019s missing that element of teamwork and camaraderie that I loved from the original as well as the darker art style. It\u2019s all preference and I\u2019m biased. Naruto surprising people with overcoming all obstacles in the original was very satisfying to me as well. \n\nA bit of a ramble and not even half of what I could write but there\u2019s some of the reasoning and thought process of why I love the original over shippuden and think it\u2019s more rewatchable",

I get what you're saying about the dark themes and whatnot, but I personally feel that it's a little contrived at times, like it takes itself too seriously... After all it's not truly grim and gruesome like some series, like AoT. Which is totally fine, it just kinda pulls me out from the immersion. You got a good point about the cameraderie thing, not as much of it in shippuden - it's the Naruto Sasuke show. Which I think is honestly where most of my enjoyment of the series comes from anyway, so that's probably where our different opinions reside",

I get what you're saying about the dark themes and whatnot, but I personally feel that it's a little contrived at times, like it takes itself too seriously... After all it's not truly grim and gruesome like some series, like AoT. Which is totally fine, it just kinda pulls me out from the immersion. You got a good point about the cameraderie thing, not as much of it in shippuden - it's the Naruto Sasuke show. Which I think is honestly where most of my enjoyment of the series comes from anyway, so that's probably where our different opinions reside",

Not all our beloved characters will become as strong as Naruto and Sasuke during all those years because everyone's journey is different and peacetime will definitely dull any of their senses after being constantly at war since birth.",
