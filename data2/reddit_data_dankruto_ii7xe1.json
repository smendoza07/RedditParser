I get that people don't like him having tons of power for no reason, but it makes sense for him. Think of the uchiha. They were naturally gifted because of their clan. They had to train yo build up on that, but boruto is kinda the same way. When you also consider that naruto is ashura's reincarnate, making naruto pretty much pure senju, and hinata is main branch hyuga, it makes sense for him to be naturally gifted. Momoshiki said something about the otsutsuki blood being strong in boruto. That's likely a result of his senju blood (son of ashura's reincarnate) and his hyuga blood (son of hinata. Main branch hyuga). Im really just basing the hyuga thing off of otsutsuki typically having byakugan. Even if that weren't important, what is important is that boruto is strong because at the very least he has what could be considered \"main branch\" senju blood, main branch hyuga blood, and the karma.",

His power feels pretty earned from the manga imo. I get that it doesn't matter to you, but I feel like I've heard the argument once or twice . The manga is also decently paced. Think about og naruto. In the manga, naruto leaves with jiraya immediately after sasuke leaves. In the anime there are another 100 episodes. Boruto is pretty much the same way. Idk what else to say without spoiling it, but I just want people to stop hating on boruto so hard. It isnt naruto part one. Far from it. But its pretty good in its own right, and I can't wait for the anime to be finished so I can watch the manga cut of it start to finish.",

I get that people don't like him having tons of power for no reason, but it makes sense for him. Think of the uchiha. They were naturally gifted because of their clan. They had to train yo build up on that, but boruto is kinda the same way. When you also consider that naruto is ashura's reincarnate, making naruto pretty much pure senju, and hinata is main branch hyuga, it makes sense for him to be naturally gifted. Momoshiki said something about the otsutsuki blood being strong in boruto. That's likely a result of his senju blood (son of ashura's reincarnate) and his hyuga blood (son of hinata. Main branch hyuga). Im really just basing the hyuga thing off of otsutsuki typically having byakugan. Even if that weren't important, what is important is that boruto is strong because at the very least he has what could be considered \"main branch\" senju blood, main branch hyuga blood, and the karma.",

His power feels pretty earned from the manga imo. I get that it doesn't matter to you, but I feel like I've heard the argument once or twice . The manga is also decently paced. Think about og naruto. In the manga, naruto leaves with jiraya immediately after sasuke leaves. In the anime there are another 100 episodes. Boruto is pretty much the same way. Idk what else to say without spoiling it, but I just want people to stop hating on boruto so hard. It isnt naruto part one. Far from it. But its pretty good in its own right, and I can't wait for the anime to be finished so I can watch the manga cut of it start to finish.",

I get that people don't like him having tons of power for no reason, but it makes sense for him. Think of the uchiha. They were naturally gifted because of their clan. They had to train yo build up on that, but boruto is kinda the same way. When you also consider that naruto is ashura's reincarnate, making naruto pretty much pure senju, and hinata is main branch hyuga, it makes sense for him to be naturally gifted. Momoshiki said something about the otsutsuki blood being strong in boruto. That's likely a result of his senju blood (son of ashura's reincarnate) and his hyuga blood (son of hinata. Main branch hyuga). Im really just basing the hyuga thing off of otsutsuki typically having byakugan. Even if that weren't important, what is important is that boruto is strong because at the very least he has what could be considered \"main branch\" senju blood, main branch hyuga blood, and the karma.",

His power feels pretty earned from the manga imo. I get that it doesn't matter to you, but I feel like I've heard the argument once or twice . The manga is also decently paced. Think about og naruto. In the manga, naruto leaves with jiraya immediately after sasuke leaves. In the anime there are another 100 episodes. Boruto is pretty much the same way. Idk what else to say without spoiling it, but I just want people to stop hating on boruto so hard. It isnt naruto part one. Far from it. But its pretty good in its own right, and I can't wait for the anime to be finished so I can watch the manga cut of it start to finish.",

                    "body": "The anime has been 99% filler. It's garbage. The manga is the picture of a big Mac and the anime is what you get. His power feels pretty earned from the manga imo. I get that it doesn't matter to you, but I feel like I've heard the argument once or twice . The manga is also decently paced. Think about og naruto. In the manga, naruto leaves with jiraya immediately after sasuke leaves. In the anime there are another 100 episodes. Boruto is pretty much the same way. Idk what else to say without spoiling it, but I just want people to stop hating on boruto so hard. It isnt naruto part one. Far from it. But its pretty good in its own right, and I can't wait for the anime to be finished so I can watch the manga cut of it start to finish.",

            "body": "The anime has been 99% filler. It's garbage. The manga is the picture of a big Mac and the anime is what you get. His power feels pretty earned from the manga imo. I get that it doesn't matter to you, but I feel like I've heard the argument once or twice . The manga is also decently paced. Think about og naruto. In the manga, naruto leaves with jiraya immediately after sasuke leaves. In the anime there are another 100 episodes. Boruto is pretty much the same way. Idk what else to say without spoiling it, but I just want people to stop hating on boruto so hard. It isnt naruto part one. Far from it. But its pretty good in its own right, and I can't wait for the anime to be finished so I can watch the manga cut of it start to finish.",
