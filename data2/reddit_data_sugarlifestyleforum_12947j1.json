    "author": "HarvardLawSB",
    "body": "This post was inspired by (1) a couple specific comments, (2) a general sentiment about SBs who have had several successful SRs that I've seen over the years on SLF, and (3) a desire to procrastinate working on my school work while I sit at the airport.\n\n**Here are three quotes from this sub that sum up what I'm responding to:**\n\n>\"I avoid ... veterans. I want a SB who values chemistry too, not solely money.\"  \n>  \n>\"The ... veterans will anchor to the highest experience ... and goal seek max compensation over other things\"  \n>  \n>\"inexperienced women (regardless of age 18-30) are much more open to actual sugar relationships and very experienced ones are typically more NSA and business like\"\n\n*Want to preface this by saying there is nothing wrong with new SBs. I was once a new SB. If they do their research and are fully informed going into this, it can be a great experience for everyone.*\n\n**So without further ado... this is the truth about veteran SBs:**\n\n**We are just SBs.** We each have our own approach and ideals about sugaring. We are not a monolith. We are not all of the same opinion. We do not all have the same perspective or modus operandi. We don't have weekly meetings where we come to a consensus on how we will treat our SRs or our SDs.\n\n**We know what we want.** We have had enough time in the bowl to have some awesome experiences. We have developed a good radar and bullshit detector. We have learned how to communicate directly and you won't need to guess where you stand with us. We know when something is good and do everything in our power to keep it.\n\n**We know what we want in bed.** We are likely more sexually experienced and therefore we can help guide you in very fun ways.... we know what excites us and gets us off. We know the intoxication of exploring something new with a new partner.\n\n**We know what we** ***don't*** **want.** This is an often overlooked benefit of experience. We won't waste your time if we're not looking for the same things.\n\n**We have learned from our experiences, both good** ***and*** **bad.** I will be the first to say I made a lot of mistakes as a newbie SB. I remember very vividly the time in college that I decided to blow off my SD and hang out with my friends instead... even though he traveled all the way from Seattle to see me with a brand new, top of the line macbook. I won't say I *never* make mistakes anymore, but I will say they are much less frequent and much less egregious. My future SD will benefit from the hard lessons I learned until now.\n\n**And again, I'll restate: we are just SBs.**",

At my age, time is now so valuable that I'd rather quickly arrive at \"this won't work out for either of us and that's OK\" than spend weeks with a very young newbie who really needs money, is desperately trying to please me and has no idea how.   \n\n\nThe \"emotional connection\" IMO is much more likely to be found with a \"veteran\" who has more life experience and understands men so much better. We men often struggle with the 100,000 yr instinct of \"you need to find a virgin\", an instinct that no longer really serves much purpose.  Thanks, HarvardLawSB, as always, you write beautifully and on point. Looking forward to reading your appellate briefs one day. :)",

There\u2019s also a lot to be gained collaborating with the 3x postdoc\u2014day to day experiments run smoothly and troubleshooting is methodical, they know the system. Both have their negatives: the ms student is often irresponsible, delusional, negligent; the postdoc can be stubborn and smug. \n\nI think it *does* say something when a PI can\u2019t keep senior researchers around because they can\u2019t stand not being the lord of the land though ;)",

Might use too much of a cookie cutter/ manufactured approach vs a spontaneous/ creative one.\n\nOver-qualification gets magnified more in places where there is a rapid and overwhelming flow of new talent who can do the same job for less with more enthusiasm. \n\nSo even in corporate circles, experience especially too much of it does not help. \n\nWhat helps is the right fit. Sometimes experience is the order of the day and sometimes not. \n\nI may be in the minority but I see that experience or too much of it in the SB world may not give the SD much of an added relationship boost. That\u2019s just my opinion. \n\nThat does not make the veteran SB jaded etc but clearly there is a line in the sand in terms of expectations due to previous relationships which likely happened during more youthful years.\n\nSo then what is the net benefit for an SD to fork a 30% premium for seasoned / experienced vs someone with moderate expectations, more enthusiasm and potential. \n\nNot saying experience is bad but is it worth the premium that vets want, I am not sure.",

The practical effect of that is that I would waste no one\u2019s time with either bailing on or doing a M&G I wasn\u2019t enthusiastic about. I would be much clearer with what I wanted and didn\u2019t want, so I could communicate more effectively. And I have generally grown as a person and done more therapy, so would be a better partner to someone who is a good fit. To me, these all seem like benefits for any potential SD.",

To me, I think the challenge with experienced SBs is exactly what you said:   they know exactly what they want, I know exactly what I want, if the two don't match and neither of us compromise, we end up saying \"goodbye & good luck\" quickly.  That's a pattern that's played out a good number of times, two people who know exactly what they want and don't want and won't waver, have to match pretty well from the start.   \n\nMy last 3 SBs have all had one SD before me, so not veterans but not brand new.  Although now that I type that sentence out, I realize that claiming to have had just one SD before, is the perfect cover story to avoid \"veteran SB stigma\", but still have a reason why she seems to know what she's doing.  So maybe I was lightly tricked by a vet \ud83e\udd23  They were all great SBs so whether new or not, it worked out.",

It\u2019s nice to be the first guy to expose someone to a Michelin starred restaurant, their first Broadway play, their first trip out of the country. There is a sense of wonder attached to that which you can\u2019t replicate.

I think we are very aligned in how we feel on this subject.\n\nThere is definitely something magical in being a part of someone's first experience doing something. But I do think that with the right personality, that wonder can be had regardless of level of experience.\n\nFor example... I've seen a ton of broadway shows-- in fact I'm coming back from NYC right now. But every show is an incredible new experience. I saw Kimberly Akimbo this afternoon and was in awe of the piece. Being in a Michelin star restaurant might not be new, but maybe this particular entree or this particular restaurant is. \n\nThere is wonder to be found wherever we look :). The more I experience wondrous things, the more grateful I am for being able to experience them.",

The issue I have with your post is that some SDs have made observations, based on their own experiences, about some negative tendencies that *they* have seen in *their* experiences with veteran SBs compared to newer ones. \n\nYou are, of course, 100% correct that every veteran SB is unique, but are there any tendencies with veteran SBs, any trends that we can expect to be more likely?  You seem to suggest that we should ignore any trends that SDs have seen, while taking your word for it to expect certain good attributes.",

It makes sense as to why some of them would want someone who\u2019s inexperienced and new at it. \n\nExperience and wisdom will make it easier for us to spot those fraudulent dudes who are essentially con artists parading around (online lol) as wealthy, affluent and successful, trustworthy men. Or whatever set of traits they decide to put on like a freakin mask to impress naive, new and possibly gullible women in the bowl. \n\nHowever, with that being said, I know, there are definitely other reasons that someone would want a new SB. also, just because one is a veteran, doesn\u2019t exclude them from making mistakes or having poor judgement regarding seeking POTs \ud83d\ude05",

It appears the only way you'd be happy with an experienced SB - a woman who knows herself and the sugar bowl more than beginners - is if you poached her from another SR?  Perhaps you could talk to your last SB and ask if she has any friends who are in a present SR that might be interested in a new position (or two).",

You seem driven to make a clap-back point which itself maybe valid, but you're responding to a straw man and not the actual points that were being made.\n\nOriginal quote:\n\n>If they are veteran SBs...they will have likely have had at least 1 highly generous (above   \naverage allowance) SD or BF and therefore anchor their expectations to the higher numbers they have received in the past.\n\nWhich is basically the longer someone sugars, the greater the chance they will meet a highly generous man/whale. This is just probability: more dates = more chances of meeting a variety of people. It's also hard for anyone that has received a whale's allowance to settle on an average allowance after that. This is common sense and nothing personal.  \n\n\n>We are just SBs\n\nYes, but anyone that has lived the sugar life for years and decided it is for them has likely gone through a lot. The bowl can be an ugly place and many of us that have been doing this a long time (SDs and SBs) are jaded about a number of aspects of it. \n\nDon't pretend that jadedness doesn't leak into interactions or expectations, it does. I don't like newbies but I prefer women that are excited about this experience, not SBs that have spent years dealing with splendas, johns, and otherwise terrible men (veterans)",

I don't think *all* of any group of people (SBs included) have one quality like \"being jaded\". That part of your post I agree with: there is no veteran SB monolith, there is lots of diversity.\n\nI think being a veteran increases the chances you will be jaded, but certainly not all veterans are (you for example). As a SD, I have limited time and don't want to waste it on SBs that won't be a good fit, so I exclude veterans because they are more likely to be jaded and not what I want. I miss some good veterans, but it saves me time and disappointment.\n\n>many experiences both good and bad that we are are all jaded and unexcited\n\nI think there are more bad men in the bowl than good. Do this long enough, you've probably experience a lot of bad men and a few really great SDs. That experience benefits you as a SB but it often means a SD like me will spend a lot of time trying to prove to you I'm not like the majority bad men.

I generally read things in their best light and assume their best meaning. You appear to seek the negative connotation, not \"as written\"  If you want to get into the full analytical context of the \"as written\" words though, and the order things were written, she started with it was a mistake she made. She then elaborated on it being a mistake because the guy travelled a long distance for her. All of that before the Macbook, so the gift was the least important of the three. What you wrote reads as \"gotcha bitch\" (imagine Dave Chapell voice)\n\nThis a tool my on spectrum friend uses. He takes what is written and makes a good and bad tree out of the possible communication. How can this be taken in a good way, how can it be taken in a bad way. Then he asks questions about what was said to confirm one more than the other. It takes a little more time, but has given him a much better understanding of communication, and people in general.",

Might use too much of a cookie cutter/ manufactured approach vs a spontaneous/ creative one.\n\nOver-qualification gets magnified more in places where there is a rapid and overwhelming flow of new talent who can do the same job for less with more enthusiasm. \n\nSo even in corporate circles, experience especially too much of it does not help. \n\nWhat helps is the right fit. Sometimes experience is the order of the day and sometimes not. \n\nI may be in the minority but I see that experience or too much of it in the SB world may not give the SD much of an added relationship boost. That\u2019s just my opinion. \n\nThat does not make the veteran SB jaded etc but clearly there is a line in the sand in terms of expectations due to previous relationships which likely happened during more youthful years.\n\nSo then what is the net benefit for an SD to fork a 30% premium for seasoned / experienced vs someone with moderate expectations, more enthusiasm and potential. \n\nNot saying experience is bad but is it worth the premium that vets want, I am not sure.",

Is that correct?\n\nIf so, overqualified in what sense? What does their experience make them more qualified for?\n\nWhat does their experience take away? \n\nI ask because from my point of view, the difference between how I would approach this kind of dating now vs a couple years ago is that I understand the lay of the land much better so am less reticent. The practical effect of that is that I would waste no one\u2019s time with either bailing on or doing a M&G I wasn\u2019t enthusiastic about. I would be much clearer with what I wanted and didn\u2019t want, so I could communicate more effectively. And I have generally grown as a person and done more therapy, so would be a better partner to someone who is a good fit. To me, these all seem like benefits for any potential SD.",

You really just want us to judge based on \"the human\" and not the experience?\n\nRegardless, it's a lofty idea, but we all have our shortcuts to finding the best relationships. You probably filter out certain men on SA for various reasons, I filter out women that have been on there for 5+ years.

I don't think *all* of any group of people (SBs included) have one quality like \"being jaded\". That part of your post I agree with: there is no veteran SB monolith, there is lots of diversity.\n\nI think being a veteran increases the chances you will be jaded, but certainly not all veterans are (you for example). As a SD, I have limited time and don't want to waste it on SBs that won't be a good fit, so I exclude veterans because they are more likely to be jaded and not what I want. I miss some good veterans, but it saves me time and disappointment.\n\n>many experiences both good and bad that we are are all jaded and unexcited\n\nI think there are more bad men in the bowl than good. Do this long enough, you've probably experience a lot of bad men and a few really great SDs. That experience benefits you as a SB but it often means a SD like me will spend a lot of time trying to prove to you I'm not like the majority bad men. I prefer someone that is coming at this optimistic and grateful, not someone that assumes I'm a gross john and must prove myself not to be.",

We call it out it is and exist in a very transparent state. I\u2019m candid but tactful and the SD\u2019s respect that. \n\nI think you\u2019d have to define feelings/ emotions/ and expressions for yourself.

The practical effect of that is that I would waste no one\u2019s time with either bailing on or doing a M&G I wasn\u2019t enthusiastic about. I would be much clearer with what I wanted and didn\u2019t want, so I could communicate more effectively.

The issue I have with your post is that some SDs have made observations, based on their own experiences, about some negative tendencies that *they* have seen in *their* experiences with veteran SBs compared to newer ones. \n\nYou are, of course, 100% correct that every veteran SB is unique, but are there any tendencies with veteran SBs, any trends that we can expect to be more likely?

Or whatever set of traits they decide to put on like a freakin mask to impress naive, new and possibly gullible women in the bowl. \n\nHowever, with that being said, I know, there are definitely other reasons that someone would want a new SB. also, just because one is a veteran, doesn\u2019t exclude them from making mistakes or having poor judgement regarding seeking POTs \ud83d\ude05",

Don't you think a man that has been doing this for a month is going to be different than a man that has been doing this for 15 years? You really just want us to judge based on \"the human\" and not the experience?\n\nRegardless, it's a lofty idea, but we all have our shortcuts to finding the best relationships. You probably filter out certain men on SA for various reasons, I filter out women that have been on there for 5+ years. I don't have time to meet every human and judge them for who they are, there are hundreds of SBs so I choose who seems most likely to be a good match.",

That part of your post I agree with: there is no veteran SB monolith, there is lots of diversity.\n\nI think being a veteran increases the chances you will be jaded, but certainly not all veterans are (you for example). As a SD, I have limited time and don't want to waste it on SBs that won't be a good fit, so I exclude veterans because they are more likely to be jaded and not what I want. I miss some good veterans, but it saves me time and disappointment.\n\n>many experiences both good and bad that we are are all jaded and unexcited\n\nI think there are more bad men in the bowl than good. Do this long enough, you've probably experience a lot of bad men and a few really great SDs. That experience benefits you as a SB but it often means a SD like me will spend a lot of time trying to prove to you I'm not like the majority bad men. I prefer someone that is coming at this optimistic and grateful, not someone that assumes I'm a gross john and must prove myself not to be.",

I think it depends entirely on the man to whether that's a positive or negative. I feel for the more SBF end of the spectrum I'm on, they may come off a little too efficient and formal, but for your standard SD I would say it's a solid plus. \n\nSo, please don't think i think sugar partners with experience is a bad thing at all. I think it may narrow your pool but chances are you'll be more appealing to those experienced SDs, who are ultimately wading through the swamp to find each other. Glub blub.",

It makes sense as to why some of them would want someone who\u2019s inexperienced and new at it. \n\nExperience and wisdom will make it easier for us to spot those fraudulent dudes who are essentially con artists parading around (online lol) as wealthy, affluent and successful, trustworthy men. Or whatever set of traits they decide to put on like a freakin mask to impress naive, new and possibly gullible women in the bowl. \n\nHowever, with that being said, I know, there are definitely other reasons that someone would want a new SB. also, just because one is a veteran, doesn\u2019t exclude them from making mistakes or having poor judgement regarding seeking POTs \ud83d\ude05",

It makes sense as to why some of them would want someone who\u2019s inexperienced and new at it. \n\nExperience and wisdom will make it easier for us to spot those fraudulent dudes who are essentially con artists parading around (online lol) as wealthy, affluent and successful, trustworthy men. Or whatever set of traits they decide to put on like a freakin mask to impress naive, new and possibly gullible women in the bowl. \n\nHowever, with that being said, I know, there are definitely other reasons that someone would want a new SB. also, just because one is a veteran, doesn\u2019t exclude them from making mistakes or having poor judgement regarding seeking POTs \ud83d\ude05",
