Why anyone needs more than 8\" I don't know (well, that's what she said).\n\n>...my mattress is around 11 inches. \n\n I did notice one here that was around 12\" that cost GBP 1699 inc tax (USD 1724 plus tax)\n\nI also wonder if the other dimensions are bigger in the US as well?  Here, a king size mattress is usually 2m x 1.5m or 79\" x 59\"",

Then make sure to approach it slowly and let it unfold naturally. Love bombing and getting intense really quick is not romance. Celebrating someone for their whole person, past and all, is romantic. Knowing you don\u2019t have to be in a rush to get to the wedding bells is romantic, if it\u2019s love it isn\u2019t going anywhere. Also careful he doesn\u2019t shame you for being in the bowl. That\u2019s probably why he\u2019s acting like this. He met you in the bowl and doesn\u2019t believe you\u2019ve only been with one guy.

(Serious question)\n\nHere in the UK, for example the most expensive mattresses sold by Ikea are \u00a3889 inc sales tax (US$901 plus tax).\n\nOkay, the most expensive mattresses you can get here are around US$15,700 plus tax.\n\nIf you were to go to the UK equivalent of somewhere like Nordstrom or Macy's (retailers like John Lewis or Marks & Spencers) then mattresses would still only be around \u00a3900 - \u00a31,200 inc tax (US$912-1,217 plus tax).\n\nEither mattresses are really expensive in the US or you guys have some extra super quality mattresses that we don't have over here (or a combination of both things).\n\n\nI just looked to see what sort of mattress costs US$15k here in the UK.  I really couldn't believe that anybody would pay that sort of price.  Apparently, the filling consists of cashmere, British wool, Egyptian cotton and hemp.  I don't think that I'd pay over the odds for that.",

I think I paid like 1100 for my mattress/bed (in Czech) - and it was one of the most expensive ones ikea had.  It was still pretty meah.\n\nGenerally speaking, I do think we have a different type/quality of mattress/box spring in the US.  Just the size, for example.  My box-spring is 9 inches high;  my mattress is around 11 inches.  I found the vast majority of the mattresses in Europe to be extremely thin.  \n\nThat said, I think some may prefer that style.  \n\nAnyway, calling 1k cheap is an exaggeration.  A better statement is that 1k would be on the low end of what is generally considered a higher quality/good mattress.  They do commonly go up into the 2-3k range.  (that price is including the box spring also).",

My box-spring is 9 inches high; my mattress is around 11 inches. I found the vast majority of the mattresses in Europe to be extremely thin.\n\nOK, that makes much more sense.  I just went to measure my bed and the pocket sprung mattress is just over 8\" deep.  Why anyone needs more than 8\" I don't know (well, that's what she said).\n\n>...my mattress is around 11 inches. \n\n I did notice one here that was around 12\" that cost GBP 1699 inc tax (USD 1724 plus tax)\n\nI also wonder if the other dimensions are bigger in the US as well?  Here, a king size mattress is usually 2m x 1.5m or 79\" x 59\"",

(Serious question)\n\nHere in the UK, for example the most expensive mattresses sold by Ikea are \u00a3889 inc sales tax (US$901 plus tax).\n\nOkay, the most expensive mattresses you can get here are around US$15,700 plus tax.\n\nIf you were to go to the UK equivalent of somewhere like Nordstrom or Macy's (retailers like John Lewis or Marks & Spencers) then mattresses would still only be around \u00a3900 - \u00a31,200 inc tax (US$912-1,217 plus tax).\n\nEither mattresses are really expensive in the US or you guys have some extra super quality mattresses that we don't have over here (or a combination of both things).\n\n\nI just looked to see what sort of mattress costs US$15k here in the UK.  I really couldn't believe that anybody would pay that sort of price.  Apparently, the filling consists of cashmere, British wool, Egyptian cotton and hemp.  I don't think that I'd pay over the odds for that.",

I think I paid like 1100 for my mattress/bed (in Czech) - and it was one of the most expensive ones ikea had.  It was still pretty meah.\n\nGenerally speaking, I do think we have a different type/quality of mattress/box spring in the US.  Just the size, for example.  My box-spring is 9 inches high;  my mattress is around 11 inches.  I found the vast majority of the mattresses in Europe to be extremely thin.  \n\nThat said, I think some may prefer that style.  \n\nAnyway, calling 1k cheap is an exaggeration.  A better statement is that 1k would be on the low end of what is generally considered a higher quality/good mattress.  They do commonly go up into the 2-3k range.  (that price is including the box spring also).",

My box-spring is 9 inches high; my mattress is around 11 inches. I found the vast majority of the mattresses in Europe to be extremely thin.\n\nOK, that makes much more sense.  I just went to measure my bed and the pocket sprung mattress is just over 8\" deep.  Why anyone needs more than 8\" I don't know (well, that's what she said).\n\n>...my mattress is around 11 inches. \n\n I did notice one here that was around 12\" that cost GBP 1699 inc tax (USD 1724 plus tax)\n\nI also wonder if the other dimensions are bigger in the US as well?  Here, a king size mattress is usually 2m x 1.5m or 79\" x 59\"",

I really couldn't believe that anybody would pay that sort of price.  Apparently, the filling consists of cashmere, British wool, Egyptian cotton and hemp.

I found the vast majority of the mattresses in Europe to be extremely thin.  \n\nThat said, I think some may prefer that style.  \n\nAnyway, calling 1k cheap is an exaggeration.  A better statement is that 1k would be on the low end of what is generally considered a higher quality/good mattress.  They do commonly go up into the 2-3k range.

(Serious question)\n\nHere in the UK, for example the most expensive mattresses sold by Ikea are \u00a3889 inc sales tax (US$901 plus tax).\n\nOkay, the most expensive mattresses you can get here are around US$15,700 plus tax.\n\nIf you were to go to the UK equivalent of somewhere like Nordstrom or Macy's (retailers like John Lewis or Marks & Spencers) then mattresses would still only be around \u00a3900 - \u00a31,200 inc tax (US$912-1,217 plus tax).\n\nEither mattresses are really expensive in the US or you guys have some extra super quality mattresses that we don't have over here (or a combination of both things).\n\n\nI just looked to see what sort of mattress costs US$15k here in the UK.  I really couldn't believe that anybody would pay that sort of price.  Apparently, the filling consists of cashmere, British wool, Egyptian cotton and hemp.  I don't think that I'd pay over the odds for that.",

I think I paid like 1100 for my mattress/bed (in Czech) - and it was one of the most expensive ones ikea had.  It was still pretty meah.\n\nGenerally speaking, I do think we have a different type/quality of mattress/box spring in the US.  Just the size, for example.  My box-spring is 9 inches high;  my mattress is around 11 inches.  I found the vast majority of the mattresses in Europe to be extremely thin.  \n\nThat said, I think some may prefer that style.  \n\nAnyway, calling 1k cheap is an exaggeration.  A better statement is that 1k would be on the low end of what is generally considered a higher quality/good mattress.  They do commonly go up into the 2-3k range.  (that price is including the box spring also).",

I just went to measure my bed and the pocket sprung mattress is just over 8\" deep.  Why anyone needs more than 8\" I don't know (well, that's what she said).\n\n>...my mattress is around 11 inches. \n\n I did notice one here that was around 12\" that cost GBP 1699 inc tax (USD 1724 plus tax)\n\nI also wonder if the other dimensions are bigger in the US as well?  Here, a king size mattress is usually 2m x 1.5m or 79\" x 59\"",

My box-spring is 9 inches high;  my mattress is around 11 inches.  I found the vast majority of the mattresses in Europe to be extremely thin.  \n\nThat said, I think some may prefer that style.  \n\nAnyway, calling 1k cheap is an exaggeration.  A better statement is that 1k would be on the low end of what is generally considered a higher quality/good mattress.  They do commonly go up into the 2-3k range.

I just went to measure my bed and the pocket sprung mattress is just over 8\" deep.  Why anyone needs more than 8\" I don't know (well, that's what she said).\n\n>...my mattress is around 11 inches. \n\n I did notice one here that was around 12\" that cost GBP 1699 inc tax (USD 1724 plus tax)\n\nI also wonder if the other dimensions are bigger in the US as well?  Here, a king size mattress is usually 2m x 1.5m or 79\" x 59\"",

Or maybe he just is OCD about mattresses.  \n\nNow if someone doesn't want to risk some of those things MAYBE being true, that is one thing and I never said one shouldn't be cautious.  \n\nBut to all those who are saying all those other negative things MUST he true, I am saying NO, you are merely speculating and do NOT know that for a fact.  \n\nWhy is that so hard for some of you to admit?  Like, just admit you don't really know if any of those bad things people speculated might be true are true, you just are deciding you don't want to risk the possibility.  That is reasonable.
