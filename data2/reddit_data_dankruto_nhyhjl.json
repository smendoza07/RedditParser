They didn't find him through that but Itachi did and teamed up with him instead of alerting his Father and village leaders that there was an intruder.\n\nEven if Itachi didn't know for sure that he was responsible for Kurama's rampage, he should have put it together since he claimed to be Madara. Itachi outright says he knows he had a grudge against the village and his clan for shunning him and Obito plays along. That should have told him everything he needed to know.\n\nIt's like if the FBI targeted you even though you didn't do anything wrong and got you to commit a crime that you wouldn't have normally. That's a real thing btw, it's called [entrapment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrapment).\n\nThey really let the real criminal go and used the circumstances to eliminate the people they hated. Hiruzen talking about the Will of Fire is BS, at least he wasn't eager to kill them off like Danzo, Koharu, and Homura though. They really hated them, Koharu outright said the reason they can't have a coup is because they'll lose their power, not because it would be bad for the rest of the village.\n\nAnd as an Akatsuki, Itachi was a terrible spy. He must not have ever passed intel back to the village because Jiraiya only knew a tiny amount about them and allowed them to capture 7 of the tailed beasts.",
