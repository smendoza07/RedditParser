    "body": "Well\u2026. the brief history leading up to this story is that after my wife and I separated, I joined SA\u2026 and I went on what has been described around here as \u201ckid in a candy store\u201d journey for over a year. It was great fun, and I guess I got it out of my system; everything I had missed out on in my 20s, and then some. And then I decided that it may be more meaningful to find one long-term SB, because I had no intention of pursuing a \u201creal\u201d relationship\u2026 and went on SA with that mindset. And that also went really well.\n\nI always look for university students; they\u2019re generally serious, intelligent and are on the site usually with the same idea, which meshes perfectly with me: make some money to pay off debts by finding one serious and stable and compatible SD, while working hard and studying.\n\nI had two long-term SBs that were in their last years of school, so inevitably, once it was over, off they went\u2026 both of them to distant graduate schools. Each of those arrangements lasted about a year. And once the second SB was on her way, I went back on SA and found\u2026\n\n\u2026 let\u2019s call her Angie. Angie was young, beautiful, intelligent and ambitious with a wicked sense of humour. We got along so well at that first coffee meet\u2026 I\u2019ll never forget it. And instantly and quickly fell into what anyone on both sides would probably call the ideal SD/SB relationship. Monthly amount agreed upon, set to be paid automatically, done. And she was usually home studying/working when not in class, and she lived alone so we\u2019d visit at her place. Sometimes a few times a week, sometimes not for three weeks. Whatever worked.\n\nThis was all perfect, but I\u2019ll mention now that one of the reasons that she was on SA to begin with was somewhat health-related. Nothing serious, but tests were being run; fatigue and work-load prevented her from getting a job. It would\u2019ve been too much, and this made sense.\n\nBut as it turns out, the illness was more serious than it appeared at first. The dreaded C-word, but, caught early and with treatment it should be ok. That was tough, but she was a tough cookie. That was about 8 months after we\u2019d met.\n\nAt some point during that, in a teary conversation, it was simply agreed upon that due to her developing fraility, the physical stuff would have to be scaled down. It was no longer fun or enjoyable for her, which of course made it no fun for me. Whatever. We can cuddle, we can cook, we can watch Netflix, we can talk. We can do everything except the most intimate stuff, and by this point I enjoyed her company so much that it was almost irrelevant. She was worried I\u2019d walk away, but that was the last thing on my mind.\n\nThat went on for a year, but unfortunately her health did not improve. On the contrary. It saddened me deeply to watch the slow deterioration of this beautiful body, but her mind and soul remained intact.\n\nI\u2019ll point out that from the beginning, as is usual, privacy and discretion were very important for her. And for me. I think everyone understands that, but in a situation like this, it would\u2019ve been nice to have been part of her inner circle, if for no other reason than I genuinely cared, and wanted to be there for her in whatever way I could\u2026 but that\u2019s complicated when there\u2019s immediate family around, taking care of her. Which they should, of course, but it prevented me from being part of it. They didn\u2019t have a clue about my existence, and we had rules about preventing that overlap. I know she\u2019d told a few of her closest friends about me; she even asked me at some point if she could share a picture. No problem, I said, though I never knew with who.\n\nNear the end, she was hospitalized and at one point, I took a calculated risk and visited her at what I felt was an opportune time. And it worked out well; we had 30 minutes to ourselves, with her next visitor showing up coincidentally as I was leaving. I\u2019ll never forget the look on her face when I appeared in that hospital. It\u2019s one of the last memories I have of her, but also one of the most powerful. The genuine happiness. Let me tell you something, SBs and SDs alike; some things can\u2019t be faked.\n\nI walked out of that hospital telling her I couldn\u2019t wait for her to get home so we could see each other again. We both bluffed our way through that bullshit, because saying a proper goodbye would\u2019ve been far too difficult. And what was there to say. It was all understood.\n\nShe died a couple of weeks later, and they held a huge memorial service for her on campus where it felt like 1,000 people showed up. I sat at the back, not knowing anyone, but recognized her family from pictures I\u2019d seen. An endless stream of people shared words about what an incredibly fantastic and awesome person Angie had been, how the world had been robbed of such a lovely soul at such an early age.\n\nAfterwards, I sat there, deep in thought while everyone streamed out past me. I watched her family walk right by me and wondered what I could have said.\n\nEventually, I stood up to go and when I did, I was approached by some young lady I\u2019d never seen before. She came up to me, and hugged me. A long, meaningful hug that lasted a good 20 seconds. Made me cry, of course. She was sobbing too. She didn\u2019t say anything, just walked away.\n\nI found her later on Angie\u2019s long list of Facebook friends; a first name I\u2019d heard before. A close friend.\n\nAnyway, what\u2019s the point of this\u2026 it\u2019s to shed some light on what I consider the vast difference that a lot of people don\u2019t get. If you think SB/SD relationships are no different than clicking on some escort website and having some random girl show up, whose name you\u2019ll never know and who couldn\u2019t care less about you\u2026 well, see above.\n\nWhile I\u2019m sure a lot of men are on sites like SA trolling around for an escort experience with a girl who isn\u2019t a pro, there are a lot who are looking for a more meaningful connection. And while there are SBs who are out to make a quick buck and not care about anything, there are those who are indeed looking for something meaningful. Or maybe they\u2019re not, but they find it.\n\nI\u2019ve been on my side trying to swim through a lot of muck on SA to find what I consider worthwhile. I have my horror stories. We all do. From the potentials SBs I\u2019ve met, they have their stories too, and I\u2019ve met the spectrum, running from drug-addicted hookers to\u2026 well, Angie. That\u2019s a big spectrum to navigate, and perhaps there\u2019s no real way to do it except by diving in.\n\nI\u2019m not sure I have a lesson to teach here; I\u2019m just relaying my experience which I think is meaningful to people on both sides of the equation. Quality exists on both sides and while it may not be easy to find, rest-assured \u2014 it\u2019s out there somewhere.\n\nAll of this happened last year. I\u2019ve been on SA since then, but it\u2019s been a hollow experience. I know I just need to heal and get past it, and one day it\u2019ll stop hurting. Until then, I\u2019m abundantly clear that I was a SD (a good one) and I found a SB (a great one) and that\u2019s what this was. But you know what, call it what you like. It was the greatest relationship of my life.\n\n \n\nEDIT: Thank you\u2026 for the gilding, but especially\u2026 I\u2019m tremendously grateful to all of you who\u2019ve responded, whether publicly or by reaching out privately. As many of you alluded to, it was indeed cathartic to write this because I\u2019ve never had a chance to let it out. I haven\u2019t really talked to anyone about it. The extent of it, last year, when I was really down, was something like \u201cHey, you ok?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cGirl trouble, right?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\nTo be able to write about it freely \u2014 among people who might understand\u2026 was incredibly liberating. It was very difficult to get it all down. There was a lot I wrote \u2014 many paragraphs \u2014 that were left on the cutting-room floor. Just too personal to post, but writing it and seeing what I wrote\u2026 part of the process.\n\nAnyway, having you all read this brings back to life our story, which till recently existed only with me. I\u2019m genuinely touched by the responses, many of them evoking the sort of emotion I continue to feel. I appreciate you all helping me through this journey of healing, whether you meant to or not. You\u2019re all awesome people.",

First, to those short-sighted SBs and SDs who troll these grounds claiming SRs are only about sex and money equating it to sex work, this is a poignant and powerful F U to them,  how ignorant they are and the gall to preach about sonething they know nothing about, just bc theyre unfortunate enough to never have experienced it.  Second, for me an unhappily married guy with a pretty decent but far from perfect SB, this restores some faith for me and renews my spirit to continue chasing happiness, at a time when my tank is running on mere fumes.  As they say, time heals all wounds and based on your track record, your success is not luck but clearly earned.",
