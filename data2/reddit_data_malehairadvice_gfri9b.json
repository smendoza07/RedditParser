If you have really thick hair it may need to be thinned a little if you plan on using the same hair product as he is using since it might make the hair heavy.\n\n1. Grow your hair out to about 8+ inches\n\n2. Get an undercut, leaving the lop at 8+ inches, and cutting the sides and back to about an inch and half or two.\n\n3. Towel dry until hair is slightly damp, then comb your hair, then use fingers to rough it up a little. \n\n4. Dry the hair on low heat, using your fingers as a diffuser, you may need a spiral brush to get a little lift towards the front to get the \"droop\"\n\n5. Use light hair product: watered down gel, light wax, light pomade or clay are some things you can try since I'm not sure from the picture",
