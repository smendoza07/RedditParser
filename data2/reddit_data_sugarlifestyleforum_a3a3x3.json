Like, ????? Where did you come from?\nI have had men get aggressive and hostile when I\u2019ve specified that\u2019s not the type of arrangement I\u2019m looking for, some who even try to guilt or manipulate me into thinking that they\u2019re doing me a favor. \n\nThis is kind of a rant, I\u2019m just really frustrated. \nIt can\u2019t be just me having this experience, right?",

I feel more in control that way, am able to vet better and found men who weren\u2019t blasting out attempts to find a last minute hooker.  \n\nThe funniest part is when you don\u2019t respond to the type you\u2019ve described and they see you\u2019ve \u201cread\u201d their message and get PISSED because you know... you should be over the moon to have the opportunity to get a job as a hooker.  My favorite is when they even go as far as to follow up with an angry \u201cwhy are you even on here if you\u2019re not trying to meet up? Don\u2019t you want to make money?\u201d  As if every female is required to meet anyone for any arrangement and do anything to \u201cmake money\u201d\n\nOnce you get your own vetting techniques men like this become white noise and their messages just become comedic relief ",

The amount of time was really more based on the chemistry between us.  \n\nThat's why I always challenge the \"hourly rate of an escort\" x 5, or something for 5 hour dates.

I think this is often confused with \u201cpros\u201d when in reality it\u2019s just people who have the personality type to feel prepared and understand what they are getting into.  Therefore I\u2019m sure there are SBs who are happy with lower allowances and don\u2019t care to research because they don\u2019t have that personality type... just like there are SDs who don\u2019t reddit and don\u2019t care about \u201cmarket prices\u201d and just want to give generous spending money to their SB.

People definitely have preferences and sugar *is* spectrum...but I believe the spectrum ends and just because it's a \"relationship\" and there's intimacy and money involved does not make it a SUGAR relationship. \n",

Sugar is really what you make it. I understand your point of view but it's not the same for everyone. For example if i was to date a homeless woman, $100 would be sugar. If i was to pickup Kendall Jenner, $1,000,000 would be saltier than the Bonneville Salt Flats. ",

When they speak about this with sincerity and passion, it's hard to view it as an act. Sure, could there be some embellishment? Of course! But when it becomes an over-arching theme and each case is different and fits their narrative of their life? It is harder to discredit it that POT or SB is just buttering you up. \n\n> What is up is that a lot of the women have told similar stories so the likelihood of some truth being there is extremely high.\n\nThis. After the first couple of years into the bowl, I became far more discerning about the women I would meet and subsequently see. At that point, whether they were 18 or 44, many expressed the same sentiment.\n\n* Just having a job is a bonus\n* The simple act of treating a woman like a human being is typically a step up\n*  Many times they referred to their younger more age-appropriate vanilla BF's as a \"man child\". Usually because their relationship started great - but she \"outpaced and outgrew\" the guy\n* Sugar dating or not - typically the vanilla beau falls flat on the \"financial support\" end of the relationship\n\nFor some, the points above are simply a given and shouldn't even be mentioned - to which I totally agree! The fact _they are mentioned by the POT's and SB's of every age group_? One tends to wonder.",

What *SLF* dictates as inside the bubble of a traditional sugar relationship, and the PPMs associated with that label, I think are valid. If you're looking for something that trends more towards escorting, obviously those figures are low. If you're looking for something trending more towards vanilla, maybe those seem high. Perspective and understanding are definitely factors as to how *real* those numbers are, but what an average is for a *specific situation pertaining specifically to the reader or inquirer* are as you said, pretty impossible.

(SDs deal with the same thing, but it takes a slightly different form).  I don't think it's the majority of SDs that would respond this way.  I mean - look, most of the crap has come from this one account, that had under 100 karma.  (meaning very little active posting).  \n\n",

But I also understand the economics of the fact that at each tier of financial desire, the number of men able to support it diminishes in a geometric fashion.\n\nIs it better for that cute, intelligent, slightly socially awkward but sexually adventurous college sophomore to accept $1000/month (thus eliminating the need for her to work that cashier's job at that little off campus bistro), or to hold out for that $5000/month that she is almost certainly never going to receive?  Those numbers are not meant to be taken literally, but only to illustrate a point. The difference is roughly the disposable income difference between a man who makes a good professional salary of \\~$250K/yr to the super high achievers who make over $1M/yr.  It leaves the bowl only to the sugar superstars on either side of the relationship.\n\nIn terms of the original direction of this thread, everyone looks the same at the start, more or less.  It's why we message and vet.  You simply have to move on from the ones that you don't align with.  The men looking for a real sugar relationship get to wade through the mountain of platonic only and picture sellers, as well as the escorts.",

Accepting something that feels low for you in your mind could sour your perspective of the sugar world.  For the most part, people are pretty realistic if they consider what they\u2019d like and where they live.  A SB should never do something she\u2019s uncomfortable with or makes her feel \u201cicky\u201d.  But that threshold is different for different people in different locations.  \n\nAnd perhaps if she only feels comfortable at $5k a month, she should wait on jumping in and instead study her butt off and get a job in a major metro after graduating where $5k per month is more realistic.  \ud83d\ude42",

And some men misuse the same argument you were making as a manipulation tactic.  \n\nMy thought is:  SBs should ask for whatever they feel good about asking for and SDs should offer only what they feel good about offering.  SBs have to have their own personal experience in finding what allowance works for them and finding someone who is aligned with that.  If things with my SD ended and I couldn\u2019t find another SD who was aligned with me, I would just not have a SD.

I\u2019m not aiming for $5k but I\u2019m sure as hell not accepting less than $x, $x being out of your stated range. Sure, she could accept the low offer while continuing to look for a better arrangement. Or she could refuse the low offer to ensure she can put her energy into pursuing and being available for the better offer. \n\n\nIt almost seems like you\u2019re shaming SBs for not accepting lowball offers and trying to instill this fear of scarcity that doesn\u2019t truly exist in my experience. The emotional cost of accepting lowball offers is higher than that of eating ramen for a few weeks and/or working a minimum wage job. :)",

If  anything model quality escorts can be had from top tier traveling agencies for $300 to $350, and the agency gets half of that amount. And if she doesn\u2019t have an agency then she pays her own advertising, hotel rooms, food, gas and all other expenses to run her business.  And Typically she will have to see multiple men per day, so I can\u2019t see how multiple hours of intimacy in one day is working a fraction as hard as a sugar baby who may have had an hour of intimacy, and 2 to 4 more hours of eating, talking, and relaxing with her SD...\n\nAnd saying that a women that goes on 3-4 dates a month for a $1000 that also gets free meals, free hotels, most of the time her travel and all other expenses  covered is getting robbed..?\n\nHow do you justify this statement.? Not to many people can say they make $1000 in 15 to 20 hours. That\u2019s the equivalent of $100,000 per year.",

Some of them go as far as to exchange numbers, even after I tell them I'm looking for a traditional sugar relationship with a connection and chemistry. Then once we move to text, they send me a number, and tell me they can come over tonight. At this point, I usually go off on them, then block them.\n\nI've also had quite a few that played along quite well in messaging on Seeking, then once they gave me their number, and I googled it, it comes up on all these old escort ads and review sites that are mostly gone now.\n\nIts just part of the bowl. Its not different then having to deal with fakes and flakes.",

People definitely have preferences and sugar is spectrum...but I believe the spectrum ends and just because it's a \"relationship\" and there's intimacy and money involved does not make it a SUGAR relationship.\n\nWell said. I never understand why some men get mad that some woman is received $100k per month, while at the same time some women get mad that a man is only doing $200/ month. If that's the case more power to them. No need to assign derogatory names nor shit on their parade. If it doesn't work for you personally, just move on and be happy. ",

Sugar is really what you make it. I understand your point of view but it's not the same for everyone. For example if i was to date a homeless woman, $100 would be sugar. If i was to pickup Kendall Jenner, $1,000,000 would be saltier than the Bonneville Salt Flats. ",

I believe that our data is skewed and not a large enough sample size. But as you know a larger sample size is better. Also just the way the data is being collected has bias. Seeing what other people put down causes bias in the  stats.\n\nBut tbh, it is all a crap shoot. We don\u2019t know how big the bowl is and what our sample set size should even be.

What *SLF* dictates as inside the bubble of a traditional sugar relationship, and the PPMs associated with that label, I think are valid. If you're looking for something that trends more towards escorting, obviously those figures are low. If you're looking for something trending more towards vanilla, maybe those seem high. Perspective and understanding are definitely factors as to how *real* those numbers are, but what an average is for a *specific situation pertaining specifically to the reader or inquirer* are as you said, pretty impossible.

Without the blind collection of data via a survey the numbers are skewed. Between that and a sample set of 100, I don\u2019t trust it. Also the sample set has to be based on local.

(SDs deal with the same thing, but it takes a slightly different form).  I don't think it's the majority of SDs that would respond this way.  I mean - look, most of the crap has come from this one account, that had under 100 karma.  (meaning very little active posting).  \n\n",

But I also understand the economics of the fact that at each tier of financial desire, the number of men able to support it diminishes in a geometric fashion.\n\nIs it better for that cute, intelligent, slightly socially awkward but sexually adventurous college sophomore to accept $1000/month (thus eliminating the need for her to work that cashier's job at that little off campus bistro), or to hold out for that $5000/month that she is almost certainly never going to receive?  Those numbers are not meant to be taken literally, but only to illustrate a point. The difference is roughly the disposable income difference between a man who makes a good professional salary of \\~$250K/yr to the super high achievers who make over $1M/yr.  It leaves the bowl only to the sugar superstars on either side of the relationship.\n\nIn terms of the original direction of this thread, everyone looks the same at the start, more or less.  It's why we message and vet.  You simply have to move on from the ones that you don't align with.  The men looking for a real sugar relationship get to wade through the mountain of platonic only and picture sellers, as well as the escorts.",

Accepting something that feels low for you in your mind could sour your perspective of the sugar world.  For the most part, people are pretty realistic if they consider what they\u2019d like and where they live.  A SB should never do something she\u2019s uncomfortable with or makes her feel \u201cicky\u201d.  But that threshold is different for different people in different locations.  \n\nAnd perhaps if she only feels comfortable at $5k a month, she should wait on jumping in and instead study her butt off and get a job in a major metro after graduating where $5k per month is more realistic.  \ud83d\ude42",

And some men misuse the same argument you were making as a manipulation tactic.  \n\nMy thought is:  SBs should ask for whatever they feel good about asking for and SDs should offer only what they feel good about offering.  SBs have to have their own personal experience in finding what allowance works for them and finding someone who is aligned with that.  If things with my SD ended and I couldn\u2019t find another SD who was aligned with me, I would just not have a SD.

She's besides herself ecstatic with what I've given her.",

Sugar is really what you make it. I understand your point of view but it's not the same for everyone. For example if i was to date a homeless woman, $100 would be sugar. If i was to pickup Kendall Jenner, $1,000,000 would be saltier than the Bonneville Salt Flats. ",

When they speak about this with sincerity and passion, it's hard to view it as an act. Sure, could there be some embellishment? Of course! But when it becomes an over-arching theme and each case is different and fits their narrative of their life? It is harder to discredit it that POT or SB is just buttering you up. \n\n> What is up is that a lot of the women have told similar stories so the likelihood of some truth being there is extremely high.\n\nThis. After the first couple of years into the bowl, I became far more discerning about the women I would meet and subsequently see. At that point, whether they were 18 or 44, many expressed the same sentiment.\n\n* Just having a job is a bonus\n* The simple act of treating a woman like a human being is typically a step up\n*  Many times they referred to their younger more age-appropriate vanilla BF's as a \"man child\". Usually because their relationship started great - but she \"outpaced and outgrew\" the guy\n* Sugar dating or not - typically the vanilla beau falls flat on the \"financial support\" end of the relationship\n\nFor some, the points above are simply a given and shouldn't even be mentioned - to which I totally agree! The fact _they are mentioned by the POT's and SB's of every age group_? One tends to wonder.",

(SDs deal with the same thing, but it takes a slightly different form).  I don't think it's the majority of SDs that would respond this way.  I mean - look, most of the crap has come from this one account, that had under 100 karma.  (meaning very little active posting).  \n\n",

Accepting something that feels low for you in your mind could sour your perspective of the sugar world.  For the most part, people are pretty realistic if they consider what they\u2019d like and where they live.  A SB should never do something she\u2019s uncomfortable with or makes her feel \u201cicky\u201d.  But that threshold is different for different people in different locations.  \n\nAnd perhaps if she only feels comfortable at $5k a month, she should wait on jumping in and instead study her butt off and get a job in a major metro after graduating where $5k per month is more realistic.  \ud83d\ude42",

And some men misuse the same argument you were making as a manipulation tactic.  \n\nMy thought is:  SBs should ask for whatever they feel good about asking for and SDs should offer only what they feel good about offering.  SBs have to have their own personal experience in finding what allowance works for them and finding someone who is aligned with that.  If things with my SD ended and I couldn\u2019t find another SD who was aligned with me, I would just not have a SD.  Being a SB should be a fun and positive experience, so I just don\u2019t think anyone should feel like they have to do anything they don\u2019t want to do. ",

The emotional cost of accepting lowball offers is higher than that of eating ramen for a few weeks and/or working a minimum wage job. :)",

Sugar is really what you make it. I understand your point of view but it's not the same for everyone. For example if i was to date a homeless woman, $100 would be sugar. If i was to pickup Kendall Jenner, $1,000,000 would be saltier than the Bonneville Salt Flats. ",

When they speak about this with sincerity and passion, it's hard to view it as an act. Sure, could there be some embellishment? Of course! But when it becomes an over-arching theme and each case is different and fits their narrative of their life? It is harder to discredit it that POT or SB is just buttering you up. \n\n> What is up is that a lot of the women have told similar stories so the likelihood of some truth being there is extremely high.\n\nThis. After the first couple of years into the bowl, I became far more discerning about the women I would meet and subsequently see. At that point, whether they were 18 or 44, many expressed the same sentiment.\n\n* Just having a job is a bonus\n* The simple act of treating a woman like a human being is typically a step up\n*  Many times they referred to their younger more age-appropriate vanilla BF's as a \"man child\". Usually because their relationship started great - but she \"outpaced and outgrew\" the guy\n* Sugar dating or not - typically the vanilla beau falls flat on the \"financial support\" end of the relationship\n\nFor some, the points above are simply a given and shouldn't even be mentioned - to which I totally agree! The fact _they are mentioned by the POT's and SB's of every age group_? One tends to wonder.",

I believe that our data is skewed and not a large enough sample size. But as you know a larger sample size is better. Also just the way the data is being collected has bias. Seeing what other people put down causes bias in the  stats.\n\nBut tbh, it is all a crap shoot. We don\u2019t know how big the bowl is and what our sample set size should even be. I don\u2019t think we can trust that the data collected is valid.",

What *SLF* dictates as inside the bubble of a traditional sugar relationship, and the PPMs associated with that label, I think are valid. If you're looking for something that trends more towards escorting, obviously those figures are low. If you're looking for something trending more towards vanilla, maybe those seem high. Perspective and understanding are definitely factors as to how *real* those numbers are, but what an average is for a *specific situation pertaining specifically to the reader or inquirer* are as you said, pretty impossible.

Between that and a sample set of 100, I don\u2019t trust it. Also the sample set has to be based on local. There are one for some cities.\n\nBetween that and the arguments that have occurred.

SBs have to have their own personal experience in finding what allowance works for them and finding someone who is aligned with that.  If things with my SD ended and I couldn\u2019t find another SD who was aligned with me, I would just not have a SD.

Sugar is really what you make it. I understand your point of view but it's not the same for everyone. For example if i was to date a homeless woman, $100 would be sugar. If i was to pickup Kendall Jenner, $1,000,000 would be saltier than the Bonneville Salt Flats. ",

When they speak about this with sincerity and passion, it's hard to view it as an act. Sure, could there be some embellishment? Of course! But when it becomes an over-arching theme and each case is different and fits their narrative of their life? It is harder to discredit it that POT or SB is just buttering you up. \n\n> What is up is that a lot of the women have told similar stories so the likelihood of some truth being there is extremely high.\n\nThis. After the first couple of years into the bowl, I became far more discerning about the women I would meet and subsequently see. At that point, whether they were 18 or 44, many expressed the same sentiment.\n\n* Just having a job is a bonus\n* The simple act of treating a woman like a human being is typically a step up\n*  Many times they referred to their younger more age-appropriate vanilla BF's as a \"man child\". Usually because their relationship started great - but she \"outpaced and outgrew\" the guy\n* Sugar dating or not - typically the vanilla beau falls flat on the \"financial support\" end of the relationship\n\nFor some, the points above are simply a given and shouldn't even be mentioned - to which I totally agree! The fact _they are mentioned by the POT's and SB's of every age group_? One tends to wonder.",

What *SLF* dictates as inside the bubble of a traditional sugar relationship, and the PPMs associated with that label, I think are valid. If you're looking for something that trends more towards escorting, obviously those figures are low. If you're looking for something trending more towards vanilla, maybe those seem high. Perspective and understanding are definitely factors as to how *real* those numbers are, but what an average is for a *specific situation pertaining specifically to the reader or inquirer* are as you said, pretty impossible.

SBs have to have their own personal experience in finding what allowance works for them and finding someone who is aligned with that.  If things with my SD ended and I couldn\u2019t find another SD who was aligned with me, I would just not have a SD.

Sugar is really what you make it. I understand your point of view but it's not the same for everyone. For example if i was to date a homeless woman, $100 would be sugar. If i was to pickup Kendall Jenner, $1,000,000 would be saltier than the Bonneville Salt Flats. ",

After the first couple of years into the bowl, I became far more discerning about the women I would meet and subsequently see. At that point, whether they were 18 or 44, many expressed the same sentiment.\n\n* Just having a job is a bonus\n* The simple act of treating a woman like a human being is typically a step up\n*  Many times they referred to their younger more age-appropriate vanilla BF's as a \"man child\". Usually because their relationship started great - but she \"outpaced and outgrew\" the guy\n* Sugar dating or not - typically the vanilla beau falls flat on the \"financial support\" end of the relationship\n\nFor some, the points above are simply a given and shouldn't even be mentioned - to which I totally agree!

When they speak about this with sincerity and passion, it's hard to view it as an act. Sure, could there be some embellishment? Of course! But when it becomes an over-arching theme and each case is different and fits their narrative of their life? It is harder to discredit it that POT or SB is just buttering you up. \n\n> What is up is that a lot of the women have told similar stories so the likelihood of some truth being there is extremely high.\n\nThis. After the first couple of years into the bowl, I became far more discerning about the women I would meet and subsequently see. At that point, whether they were 18 or 44, many expressed the same sentiment.\n\n* Just having a job is a bonus\n* The simple act of treating a woman like a human being is typically a step up\n*  Many times they referred to their younger more age-appropriate vanilla BF's as a \"man child\". Usually because their relationship started great - but she \"outpaced and outgrew\" the guy\n* Sugar dating or not - typically the vanilla beau falls flat on the \"financial support\" end of the relationship\n\nFor some, the points above are simply a given and shouldn't even be mentioned - to which I totally agree! The fact _they are mentioned by the POT's and SB's of every age group_? One tends to wonder.",

When they speak about this with sincerity and passion, it's hard to view it as an act. Sure, could there be some embellishment? Of course! But when it becomes an over-arching theme and each case is different and fits their narrative of their life? It is harder to discredit it that POT or SB is just buttering you up. \n\n> What is up is that a lot of the women have told similar stories so the likelihood of some truth being there is extremely high.\n\nThis. After the first couple of years into the bowl, I became far more discerning about the women I would meet and subsequently see. At that point, whether they were 18 or 44, many expressed the same sentiment.\n\n* Just having a job is a bonus\n* The simple act of treating a woman like a human being is typically a step up\n*  Many times they referred to their younger more age-appropriate vanilla BF's as a \"man child\". Usually because their relationship started great - but she \"outpaced and outgrew\" the guy\n* Sugar dating or not - typically the vanilla beau falls flat on the \"financial support\" end of the relationship\n\nFor some, the points above are simply a given and shouldn't even be mentioned - to which I totally agree! The fact _they are mentioned by the POT's and SB's of every age group_? One tends to wonder.",

When they speak about this with sincerity and passion, it's hard to view it as an act. Sure, could there be some embellishment? Of course! But when it becomes an over-arching theme and each case is different and fits their narrative of their life? It is harder to discredit it that POT or SB is just buttering you up. \n\n> What is up is that a lot of the women have told similar stories so the likelihood of some truth being there is extremely high.\n\nThis. After the first couple of years into the bowl, I became far more discerning about the women I would meet and subsequently see. At that point, whether they were 18 or 44, many expressed the same sentiment.\n\n* Just having a job is a bonus\n* The simple act of treating a woman like a human being is typically a step up\n*  Many times they referred to their younger more age-appropriate vanilla BF's as a \"man child\". Usually because their relationship started great - but she \"outpaced and outgrew\" the guy\n* Sugar dating or not - typically the vanilla beau falls flat on the \"financial support\" end of the relationship\n\nFor some, the points above are simply a given and shouldn't even be mentioned - to which I totally agree! The fact _they are mentioned by the POT's and SB's of every age group_? One tends to wonder.",

But when it becomes an over-arching theme and each case is different and fits their narrative of their life? It is harder to discredit it that POT or SB is just buttering you up. \n\n> What is up is that a lot of the women have told similar stories so the likelihood of some truth being there is extremely high.\n\nThis. After the first couple of years into the bowl, I became far more discerning about the women I would meet and subsequently see. At that point, whether they were 18 or 44, many expressed the same sentiment.\n\n* Just having a job is a bonus\n* The simple act of treating a woman like a human being is typically a step up\n*  Many times they referred to their younger more age-appropriate vanilla BF's as a \"man child\". Usually because their relationship started great - but she \"outpaced and outgrew\" the guy\n* Sugar dating or not - typically the vanilla beau falls flat on the \"financial support\" end of the relationship\n\nFor some, the points above are simply a given and shouldn't even be mentioned - to which I totally agree! The fact _they are mentioned by the POT's and SB's of every age group_? One tends to wonder.",

When they speak about this with sincerity and passion, it's hard to view it as an act. Sure, could there be some embellishment? Of course! But when it becomes an over-arching theme and each case is different and fits their narrative of their life? It is harder to discredit it that POT or SB is just buttering you up. \n\n> What is up is that a lot of the women have told similar stories so the likelihood of some truth being there is extremely high.\n\nThis. After the first couple of years into the bowl, I became far more discerning about the women I would meet and subsequently see. At that point, whether they were 18 or 44, many expressed the same sentiment.\n\n* Just having a job is a bonus\n* The simple act of treating a woman like a human being is typically a step up\n*  Many times they referred to their younger more age-appropriate vanilla BF's as a \"man child\". Usually because their relationship started great - but she \"outpaced and outgrew\" the guy\n* Sugar dating or not - typically the vanilla beau falls flat on the \"financial support\" end of the relationship\n\nFor some, the points above are simply a given and shouldn't even be mentioned - to which I totally agree! The fact _they are mentioned by the POT's and SB's of every age group_? One tends to wonder.",
