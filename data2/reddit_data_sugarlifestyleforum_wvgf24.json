    "body": "I\u2019ve been an SD for over eight years and I thought I would share my experiences.  First the stats.  I had four long term relationships , two lasted over six years, one about five and one about two years.  I met all of them on SA.  With all of them we pretty much agreed on the first date to give it a go .  I\u2019m in my fifties, started in my forties,  and all of the SBs I was involved with were in their mid 30s to mid 40s, one was white, one asian and two were a mix.   All were cute in my opinion,  none wore a lot of make up.  I\u2019m athletic, average looking, average height, white gum. I\u2019m married, with a decent looking wife, that if she\u2019s into sex, it\u2019s definitely not with me.  My net worth is considered high, and in top tier on seeking.  I still talk to and consider myself friends with three of four.\n\nI actually didn\u2019t discuss allowances and Just made it a policy to give decent gift on the first meeting.  I just thought it would build good will and move me up in a tie breaker.  I also didn\u2019t discuss sex as I  figured it either happens if the chemistry is there or it doesn\u2019t.  After meeting a bunch of SBs I decided the best strategy would be to just have fun.  Go to cool places, cozy restaurants, desert bars etc.  make the experience enjoyable under the theory that people want to hang out if it\u2019s a good time and if it\u2019s fun and relaxed odds of other Activities go up.   \n\nThe sex with all was good to amazing and most of the time took place at cool boutique hotels or super nice hotels.  I didnt skimp on hotels because cheap is the biggest mood killer and dumb.  For me getting away is precious and I\u2019m not going to chance ruining a good time over by trying to save a few hundred bucks.  Pro Tip. Dudes if you\u2019re going through the trouble to have an SB dont be cheap, especially with accommodations.  penny pinching doesn\u2019t work in this world.  Also every time you meet, it doesn\u2019t have to end with sex.  It about the good time and the escape.   \n\nThe hottest SB and the one that lasted 8 years was always ppm, with me always giving a nice birthday n holiday gift.   She was chill, was always a great time and she always said \u201cI\u2019ll call you\u201c. We would met once or twice a month. She would text , \u201cwanna meet?\u201d And I wouldn\u2019t say no. I consider her one of my best friends now.\n\nOne was a disaster.  It lasted several years and went from incredible to straight up extortion. I though I ended things ok, but apparently not and it turned psycho pretty quickly.  I had to hire private detectives and turned into a nightmare.   The extortion demands came in emails and texts, and threatened my wife and kids.   They were from her and her \u201cfriends\u201d.  The detectives said under no circumstances ever pay and be prepared for the shit to hit the fan.  in my case it didn\u2019t go away and the shit hit the fan.  she contacted my wife, in laws and grown children.  My kids ignored , my wife was like you\u2019re a idiot and my in-laws thought it was a scammer.  The only good part of blackmail/extortion is after they reveal the threat to the world ,they have no more leverage .  My attorney said, you\u2019re some horny middle aged guy with some money, no one gIves a fuck about you.  I dealt with the situation by saying to myself, I had the relationship, no one forced me, I had my reasons and it\u2019s pathetic to cry about it now and a little late for a groveling apology.  unfortunately on the extortion front I know a bunch of SDs that faced threats or some level of shakedown.  I\u2019m my option either own it like Jack Nicholson (\u201cyou\u2019re  damm right i did) or deny it like bill clinton, just don\u2019t grovel and cry like jimmy swaggert.    \n\n\nThe reason I\u2019m retiring.  My on/off SB for the last six years is full of too much drama and im just not into it anymore, which is a sign of my age.   I\u2019m like here we go .  get Text about crisis of week, with more texts about stress etc.  The real issue is she\u2019s over extended and tried to turn being an SB into a full time occupation.   When you\u2019re juggling multiple relationships, stress goes up.... I briefly went back on seeking and getting someone just to meet in person was a chore , lots of messages with filtered pictures , from various countries that have \u201cuncles who get info on foreign exchange trading\u201c.   It\u2019s materially harder than eight years ago.  Plus given the past blow up, the wife isn\u2019t keen on a new or old SB.\n\n My two cents.  I see lots of \u201c is this a red flag?\u201d Questions.  The answer is if you\u2019re asking, it is.  If someone is fucked up, rude or pushing you to do shit you dint want to do, it\u2019s not cool, no loner enjoyable and should be avoided.    If someone threatens you , tell them to fuck off or ignore , make the judgment call.   If you get a bad vibe , figure out a way to exit .   some people need to be told directly, you\u2019re not interested as not everyone takes a hint.\n\nat the end of the day I had a great run, most of the women I met were awesome and if I wind back the clock I would have done the same thing.    hoping everyone has a good time.",

Regarding your blackmail situation, this is why I consider OPSEC to be the #1 most important thing when sugaring. I wish it wasn't the case, but I need to protect myself and my family from harm. I use fake everything always, names, numbers, emails, jobs, etc. I never integrate my SB in to my real life in any way. I am still caring and loving to my SB, it just takes place inside of a different universe that does not interact with my real life in any way. I wish it didn't have to be that way, but I was blackmailed once also and I dodged that bullet, but I do not wish to be in that situation ever again.",

Miami, West Palm Beach, Santa Monica, LA, Orlando, DC, Chicago, Boston, NYC, Munich.  Fantastic places and fantastic times.  All first class places and restaurants.  Nearly all the girls were very level headed and what I consider normal. But all fun and sensual.  \n\nAlso I did have some unusual meetups.  One set of identical twins.  Met up with three college roommates three times when in Chicago. Met with a Sugar mama and her Sugar baby. Young (18) and more my age (50).  \n\nI ended up spending too much time on the Sugar lifestyle.  So have backed away for the past two years.  Also had a couple scares. I stay in touch with a couple of the women.",
