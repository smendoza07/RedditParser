Find yourself a good barber man, one that can do it all. Just pick out one of your friends, or heck, some guy you see out and about with cool hair and ask them who cuts their hair. I've been asked before and I've asked other dudes. Their are some seriously skilled barbers out there. You just have to find them. It only took one bad haircut for me to never go to someone unless I've seen their work first hand.",
