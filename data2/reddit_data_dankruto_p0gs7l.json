I hate Sakura but she isnt useless at all . She was useless in OG Naruto but improved a lot in Shippuden and is really strong in Boruto . I hate her because of her personality but that has nothing to do with her skills . As a couple , I think SasuSaku should have never happened . But if we look at them without considering what happened in Shippuden , they are not that bad a couple . They are not a good couple for sure but they are okay . Sai and Ino and Temari and shikamaru are the best couples in Boruto . I love both Naruto and Hinata but Boruto makers have shown no chemistry between them . I would have loved to see them both interact like couples sometimes but Boruto makers arent treating them as one at all .",

But yeah, Sasuke could've ended up with either Karin or Ino or any other girl, it could've made more sense than Sakura.  \n\nNah, I strongly disagree. I am not a SS shipper but saying that SasuKarin makes more sense is just ridiculous. In part 1, Sasuke was shown to care for Sakura as a teammate. She is the only girl he ever blushed around, she's the only girl he didn't mind getting physically close to. Sakura's hug calmed him down when he lost control of his curse-seal. He begged Naruto to rescue Sakura from Gaara, and said she was precious to him. Sakura's the only person in the entire series who Sasuke expresses any gratitude toward. Sakura was also shown to understand Sasuke more after he got his curse-mark. For example, she was the only person who anticipated him leaving the village. She even warned Naruto about it. \n\nEven when Sasuke was caring for Taka in the Bee fight, it was because they reminded him of Team 7. \n\nI cannot take the outcry over SasuSaku seriously when people unironically claim SasuKarin would've been better. If anything, it would be worse because Karin was his ally when he turned all psycho. \n\nEdit: Honestly, after reading some of the comments here, Naruto fanboys just seem butthurt that Naruto didn't get the girl he wanted. And they're always gonna be butthurt that Sakura chose Sasuke over him. Lmao",

He risked his life so many times just so Sakura can get back Sasuke and she still never thanked him properly imo . I was so frustated by her reactions most of the times . I would have loved Hinata and Naruto to develop feelings for each other right after the Pain Assault . It would have been the best ship in Naruto if it would have been developed from that point only . But unfortunately , it was ignored until the end of Shippuden and then rushed so bizarrely in The Last . However , I would still say its better than SasuSaku cause atleast the reason Hinata loved Naruto was not his looks but his personality and his ninja way which inspired her to do her best .",

I'm willing to be wrong. But regardless of anything else, I refuse to believe a man who is likely not a cheater and who was away from his wife for 12 years is better at sex than dudes who have sex with their wives on the reg. If this is untrue then something is terribly wrong with OG male shinobis who married and I pity all of their wives, lol.",

You have an overactive imagination.\n\n>It's kind of funny to think that Naruto, Choji etc. are likely way better at sex than Sasuke is, given that Sasuke was always the hot bad-boy. Sai and Shikamaru always had some sexual energy to me and were paired up with serious baddies, so they probably beat Sasuke out as well? I dunno.\n\nTheres nothing to imply that at all. If anything its the opposite. They make Sarada joke about noticing Sasuke coming home late in the middle of the night and Sakura ''really enjoying it''. They also comment on Sakura having glowing/glossy skin(sign of sex in Japanese culture) in the mornings in a few episodes.\n\nWe never see any of that with the other couples and see Naruto sleeping on the sofa regularly, in fact.",

Sakura delusionally kept chasing after a clearly emotionally unavailable man (who apparently only has an open heart for Naruto), bringing a child into the situation knowing that she would never have the father she deserves. None of them have ever been truly happy about the family situation. A man who loves his wife, or even just his child, shows it through action. I recognize he was on a mission, but I doubt that there were no opportunities to connect over twelve years. When the two of them told Sarada that proof of their love was that she existed, I rolled my eyes. Her parents hooked up and then got married. That's all that happened.\n\nI want to be clear here that I recognize Sasuke became this way due to external circumstances and I've always felt for him, but just because someone's pain is justified, it doesn't mean the outcomes of their later actions should be considered okay. It's not particularly different from veterans who come back from war traumatized and then take it out on the people around them.\n\nThe biggest victim here will always be Sarada. It must have been so painful for her to see Inojin, Shikadai, Cho-cho, and even Boruto be able to go home and interact with fathers care about them and their well-beings. Poor girl.",

She doesn't seem able to notice that Sasuke is a human being with feelings and desires, and not only a handsome genius (mostly handsome, because she sure didn't give a damn about any other skilled guy).\n\nTo put it simply, I find Sakura to be a worse case than Sasuke.

I hate Sakura but she isnt useless at all . She was useless in OG Naruto but improved a lot in Shippuden and is really strong in Boruto . I hate her because of her personality but that has nothing to do with her skills . As a couple , I think SasuSaku should have never happened . But if we look at them without considering what happened in Shippuden , they are not that bad a couple . They are not a good couple for sure but they are okay . Sai and Ino and Temari and shikamaru are the best couples in Boruto . I love both Naruto and Hinata but Boruto makers have shown no chemistry between them . I would have loved to see them both interact like couples sometimes but Boruto makers arent treating them as one at all .",

I am not a SS shipper but saying that SasuKarin makes more sense is just ridiculous. In part 1, Sasuke was shown to care for Sakura as a teammate. She is the only girl he ever blushed around, she's the only girl he didn't mind getting physically close to. Sakura's hug calmed him down when he lost control of his curse-seal. He begged Naruto to rescue Sakura from Gaara, and said she was precious to him. Sakura's the only person in the entire series who Sasuke expresses any gratitude toward. Sakura was also shown to understand Sasuke more after he got his curse-mark. For example, she was the only person who anticipated him leaving the village. She even warned Naruto about it. \n\nEven when Sasuke was caring for Taka in the Bee fight, it was because they reminded him of Team 7. \n\nI cannot take the outcry over SasuSaku seriously when people unironically claim SasuKarin would've been better. If anything, it would be worse because Karin was his ally when he turned all psycho. \n\nEdit: Honestly, after reading some of the comments here, Naruto fanboys just seem butthurt that Naruto didn't get the girl he wanted. And they're always gonna be butthurt that Sakura chose Sasuke over him. Lmao",

He risked his life so many times just so Sakura can get back Sasuke and she still never thanked him properly imo . I was so frustated by her reactions most of the times . I would have loved Hinata and Naruto to develop feelings for each other right after the Pain Assault . It would have been the best ship in Naruto if it would have been developed from that point only . But unfortunately , it was ignored until the end of Shippuden and then rushed so bizarrely in The Last . However , I would still say its better than SasuSaku cause atleast the reason Hinata loved Naruto was not his looks but his personality and his ninja way which inspired her to do her best .",

Guys, it's not that serious and I have no stake in this. I neither like nor hate Sasuke. This is what I've pieced together. \n\nIf there are details in the manga that I'm missing, fine. I'm willing to be wrong. But regardless of anything else, I refuse to believe a man who is likely not a cheater and who was away from his wife for 12 years is better at sex than dudes who have sex with their wives on the reg. If this is untrue then something is terribly wrong with OG male shinobis who married and I pity all of their wives, lol.",

You have an overactive imagination.\n\n>It's kind of funny to think that Naruto, Choji etc. are likely way better at sex than Sasuke is, given that Sasuke was always the hot bad-boy. Sai and Shikamaru always had some sexual energy to me and were paired up with serious baddies, so they probably beat Sasuke out as well? I dunno.\n\nTheres nothing to imply that at all. If anything its the opposite. They make Sarada joke about noticing Sasuke coming home late in the middle of the night and Sakura ''really enjoying it''. They also comment on Sakura having glowing/glossy skin(sign of sex in Japanese culture) in the mornings in a few episodes.\n\nWe never see any of that with the other couples and see Naruto sleeping on the sofa regularly, in fact.",

            "body": "Yeah I never got this ship. It's toxic all around. Sasuke has too much trauma and developed too much selfishness to have a family. Sakura delusionally kept chasing after a clearly emotionally unavailable man (who apparently only has an open heart for Naruto), bringing a child into the situation knowing that she would never have the father she deserves. None of them have ever been truly happy about the family situation. A man who loves his wife, or even just his child, shows it through action. I recognize he was on a mission, but I doubt that there were no opportunities to connect over twelve years. When the two of them told Sarada that proof of their love was that she existed, I rolled my eyes. Her parents hooked up and then got married. That's all that happened.\n\nI want to be clear here that I recognize Sasuke became this way due to external circumstances and I've always felt for him, but just because someone's pain is justified, it doesn't mean the outcomes of their later actions should be considered okay. It's not particularly different from veterans who come back from war traumatized and then take it out on the people around them.\n\nThe biggest victim here will always be Sarada. It must have been so painful for her to see Inojin, Shikadai, Cho-cho, and even Boruto be able to go home and interact with fathers care about them and their well-beings. Poor girl.",

She doesn't seem able to notice that Sasuke is a human being with feelings and desires, and not only a handsome genius (mostly handsome, because she sure didn't give a damn about any other skilled guy).\n\nTo put it simply, I find Sakura to be a worse case than Sasuke.

I hate her because of her personality but that has nothing to do with her skills . As a couple , I think SasuSaku should have never happened . But if we look at them without considering what happened in Shippuden , they are not that bad a couple . They are not a good couple for sure but they are okay . Sai and Ino and Temari and shikamaru are the best couples in Boruto . I love both Naruto and Hinata but Boruto makers have shown no chemistry between them . I would have loved to see them both interact like couples sometimes but Boruto makers arent treating them as one at all .",

I am not a SS shipper but saying that SasuKarin makes more sense is just ridiculous. In part 1, Sasuke was shown to care for Sakura as a teammate. She is the only girl he ever blushed around, she's the only girl he didn't mind getting physically close to. Sakura's hug calmed him down when he lost control of his curse-seal. He begged Naruto to rescue Sakura from Gaara, and said she was precious to him. Sakura's the only person in the entire series who Sasuke expresses any gratitude toward. Sakura was also shown to understand Sasuke more after he got his curse-mark. For example, she was the only person who anticipated him leaving the village. She even warned Naruto about it. \n\nEven when Sasuke was caring for Taka in the Bee fight, it was because they reminded him of Team 7. \n\nI cannot take the outcry over SasuSaku seriously when people unironically claim SasuKarin would've been better. If anything, it would be worse because Karin was his ally when he turned all psycho. \n\nEdit: Honestly, after reading some of the comments here, Naruto fanboys just seem butthurt that Naruto didn't get the girl he wanted. And they're always gonna be butthurt that Sakura chose Sasuke over him. Lmao",

I would have loved Hinata and Naruto to develop feelings for each other right after the Pain Assault . It would have been the best ship in Naruto if it would have been developed from that point only .

If anything its the opposite. They make Sarada joke about noticing Sasuke coming home late in the middle of the night and Sakura ''really enjoying it''. They also comment on Sakura having glowing/glossy skin(sign of sex in Japanese culture) in the mornings in a few episodes.\n\nWe never see any of that with the other couples and see Naruto sleeping on the sofa regularly, in fact.",

She doesn't seem able to notice that Sasuke is a human being with feelings and desires, and not only a handsome genius (mostly handsome, because she sure didn't give a damn about any other skilled guy).\n\nTo put it simply, I find Sakura to be a worse case than Sasuke.

I don't like SS either, but I can't deny that it is still a popular pairing with certain demographics. In male-dominated spaces, you aren't going to find many SasuSaku stans.",

I hate Sakura but she isnt useless at all . She was useless in OG Naruto but improved a lot in Shippuden and is really strong in Boruto . I hate her because of her personality but that has nothing to do with her skills . As a couple , I think SasuSaku should have never happened . But if we look at them without considering what happened in Shippuden , they are not that bad a couple . They are not a good couple for sure but they are okay . Sai and Ino and Temari and shikamaru are the best couples in Boruto . I love both Naruto and Hinata but Boruto makers have shown no chemistry between them . I would have loved to see them both interact like couples sometimes but Boruto makers arent treating them as one at all .",

I am not a SS shipper but saying that SasuKarin makes more sense is just ridiculous. In part 1, Sasuke was shown to care for Sakura as a teammate. She is the only girl he ever blushed around, she's the only girl he didn't mind getting physically close to. Sakura's hug calmed him down when he lost control of his curse-seal. He begged Naruto to rescue Sakura from Gaara, and said she was precious to him. Sakura's the only person in the entire series who Sasuke expresses any gratitude toward. Sakura was also shown to understand Sasuke more after he got his curse-mark. For example, she was the only person who anticipated him leaving the village. She even warned Naruto about it. \n\nEven when Sasuke was caring for Taka in the Bee fight, it was because they reminded him of Team 7. \n\nI cannot take the outcry over SasuSaku seriously when people unironically claim SasuKarin would've been better. If anything, it would be worse because Karin was his ally when he turned all psycho. \n\nEdit: Honestly, after reading some of the comments here, Naruto fanboys just seem butthurt that Naruto didn't get the girl he wanted. And they're always gonna be butthurt that Sakura chose Sasuke over him. Lmao",

I would have loved Hinata and Naruto to develop feelings for each other right after the Pain Assault . It would have been the best ship in Naruto if it would have been developed from that point only . But unfortunately , it was ignored until the end of Shippuden and then rushed so bizarrely in The Last . However , I would still say its better than SasuSaku cause atleast the reason Hinata loved Naruto was not his looks but his personality and his ninja way which inspired her to do her best .",

You have an overactive imagination.\n\n>It's kind of funny to think that Naruto, Choji etc. are likely way better at sex than Sasuke is, given that Sasuke was always the hot bad-boy.

If anything its the opposite. They make Sarada joke about noticing Sasuke coming home late in the middle of the night and Sakura ''really enjoying it''. They also comment on Sakura having glowing/glossy skin(sign of sex in Japanese culture) in the mornings in a few episodes.\n\nWe never see any of that with the other couples and see Naruto sleeping on the sofa regularly, in fact.",

I am not a SS shipper but saying that SasuKarin makes more sense is just ridiculous. In part 1, Sasuke was shown to care for Sakura as a teammate. She is the only girl he ever blushed around, she's the only girl he didn't mind getting physically close to. Sakura's hug calmed him down when he lost control of his curse-seal. He begged Naruto to rescue Sakura from Gaara, and said she was precious to him. Sakura's the only person in the entire series who Sasuke expresses any gratitude toward. Sakura was also shown to understand Sasuke more after he got his curse-mark. For example, she was the only person who anticipated him leaving the village. She even warned Naruto about it. \n\nEven when Sasuke was caring for Taka in the Bee fight, it was because they reminded him of Team 7. \n\nI cannot take the outcry over SasuSaku seriously when people unironically claim SasuKarin would've been better. If anything, it would be worse because Karin was his ally when he turned all psycho. \n\nEdit: Honestly, after reading some of the comments here, Naruto fanboys just seem butthurt that Naruto didn't get the girl he wanted. And they're always gonna be butthurt that Sakura chose Sasuke over him. Lmao",

You have an overactive imagination.\n\n>It's kind of funny to think that Naruto, Choji etc. are likely way better at sex than Sasuke is, given that Sasuke was always the hot bad-boy.

If anything its the opposite. They make Sarada joke about noticing Sasuke coming home late in the middle of the night and Sakura ''really enjoying it''. They also comment on Sakura having glowing/glossy skin(sign of sex in Japanese culture) in the mornings in a few episodes.\n\nWe never see any of that with the other couples and see Naruto sleeping on the sofa regularly, in fact.",

Sai and Shikamaru always had some sexual energy to me and were paired up with serious baddies, so they probably beat Sasuke out as well? I dunno.  \n\nI need some brain bleach after thinking about all of this.\n\nEdit: I woke up to some harassing DMs and Sasuke stans clearly annoyed/upset at me. Guys, it's not that serious and I have no stake in this. I neither like nor hate Sasuke. This is what I've pieced together. \n\nIf there are details in the manga that I'm missing, fine. I'm willing to be wrong. But regardless of anything else, I refuse to believe a man who is likely not a cheater and who was away from his wife for 12 years is better at sex than dudes who have sex with their wives on the reg. If this is untrue then something is terribly wrong with OG male shinobis who married and I pity all of their wives, lol.",
