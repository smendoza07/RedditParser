    "body": "\\*\\*sorry in advance for length\n\n**Background info**:\n\nI\u2019m 25 F he\u2019s 40 M. I\u2019m African American. He\u2019s not. I\u2019m from texas. He\u2019s here for business. He found me on SA, met in December and have been together since\n\nThrough initial texting he mentioned starting as PPM and moving to an allowance as things grew which I was fine with. M&G went phenomenal, had a great time we clicked like we had known each other for years. Decided to hang out again the next day as well, had a great time once again. We never ended up talking numbers but i wasn\u2019t pressed about it. I\u2019m not in the bowl bc I need money. I just enjoy older men and use it to beef up my savings account.\n\nOver the last few months I\u2019ve just adopted the role as a SGF. He\u2019s gotten me plenty of gifts, paid to get my windshield fixed on my car, we\u2019ve done overnight stay cations in the city, pays for my massages/facials/mani pedis, covered my travel expenses when I took a trip to Florida to visit friends, etc but also If I\u2019ve had a shitty day he\u2019s all ears. Love our dynamic.\n\nIn the very beginning He told me he\u2019s been in the Army the last 22 years, switched from full active duty to reserves couple years ago. He was called down to texas for a project. While I cant confirm the project, I\u2019ve seen his military ID and seen him in uniform every time I\u2019ve stayed the night with him during the week so it checked out to me. Didn\u2019t feel the need to question his profession more than that\n\n**STORY TIME**:\n\nThis weekend we were having one of our stay cations in the city, started Friday everything was going well per usual. Saturday after dinner he asked if I would ever date a cop.. Being African American the police are one of those touchy subjects I try to avoid so I changed the subject. This morning he bought it up again and said \u201chey so you never answered my question about dating a cop\u201d And I just explained as a black girl it does make me uneasy, I know all cops aren\u2019t bad but you dont know who\u2019s for you or against you until its too late especially in the south. I would never actively pursue/entertain someone if i knew they were a cop ahead of time. He asked how my friends & family would react/would I tell them If I was. And I said that it would be flag for sure, whether its orange or red I dont know. They would show concern and I would be nervous to share. I Proceeded to ask why he kept pressing the subject.. That\u2019s when he said \u201cwhen I\u2019m not in a green uniform I\u2019m in a blue one\u201d I just kinda sat there confused and said what do you mean. That\u2019s when he told me that when he\u2019s home and not called to be on duty when the army he\u2019s a cop. Show\u2019d me pictures of him in that uniform and the awards he\u2019s won etc\n\nMy mood did a full 180, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to look at him, didnt want to talk to him. I just told him I needed a minute and paced in the hallway. When I went back into the room he kept apologizing for not being upfront sooner. Told me he was enjoying our time and was unsure of how I would react.\n\nHe\u2019s been so good to me for months, truly my favorite person I\u2019ve ever dated. I\u2019ve never had an off feeling about him, thought I hit the jack pot here But I CANNOT for the life of me shake this feeling. Not sure what the feeling is: am I upset, do I feel betrayed, am I now nervous, who knows. But I\u2019m not sure what to do here. \n\nDo I just tell him I need space to process? Is this a deal breaker? Any advice on how to get over this emotional hesitation?\n\n**Special shout out to To my fellow African American SB\u2019s out there, how would you feel?**",

This is not a vanilla relationship nor did they meet on Hinge or some other traditional dating app. Dating a cop is a good start but *how* we met is even more importantly and under *what* premise.

Would your family or friends see you differently if they knew the backstory on how we met?

He knew that if he told you upfront you wouldn't have had anything to do with him, so instead he lied by omission until you were comfortable in the relationship,  and then dropped the bomb on you.\n\nI would take some time to really think things through, think about how the relationship has been, how you see it going if it was to continue, I would probably also find out what his stance is on things like police brutality etc or make a clean break and agree to not talk about his job at all unless it's about his military work.\n\nTake a couple of days to sleep on it and get your thoughts in order, it might even be worth speaking to a therapist or someone with training who can be a neutral 3rd party and help you work through your thoughts and feelings and make the best decision for you. On reddit you're going to get advice coloured by people's opinions and they may not understand the nuance of the situation.\n\nEdited to add a word.",

Between him being a cop and lying about it, there\u2019s something more going on. This is why I mentioned in my post about trust and whether or not he will hold something against her.  \n\nHe\u2019s already broken trust by lying when he should have just been honest and upfront so she can decide on her own how she wants to proceed.

Surprise surprise he still worked there, and I ended it before he was able to get a ton of personal info on me Bc I felt highly uncomfortable w the lies and the possibility of something bad happening to me if he didn\u2019t get his way and his personality flipped a switch as a result",

And unfortunately cops are famous for lying to people and become quite skilled at it. So....do what you will with that. And then, when you think of how the profession allows them political coverage to lie. Yikes. \n\nAlso, for me, I tend to avoid people who tend to have malleable ethics. \n\nI\u2019d encourage you to tap into your identity as a woman first and foremost. What is your gut registering? Do you now feel unsafe? Do you feel lied to? \n\nOr:\n\nDo you not care really and still really like him? This is very okay and there is no reason to feel bad about this.

Yes I highlighted in my answer that you dont know who's for you or against you implying white cops because the majority of the cops in my area are white. *BUT* even if he wasn't I would be uneasy. Cops as a whole have stats on being abusive to women/their families. That is still not a place I would like to be in. Him being white just brought in another level of concern for me personally \n\nBeing a double minority (AA and a woman) is exhausting. So many extra precautions have to be taken to stay safe.

                    "body": "Yeah I think this seems like a really fair and balanced assessment. \n\nI listened to this podcast about how, in NYC especially, there was this huge drive to \u201cincrease police activity\u201d but also decrease the number of crimes reported and charged for. On the outside this made it so that politicians could say \u201ccrime is going down\u201d under their governance, when in reality it was just being underreported (this was SUPER bad - like rape victims were in many cases unable to convict their rapists!!). It also led to police being encouraged/forced by their superiors to arrest people who fitted the visual profile of someone who committed a crime in the area (this disproportionally targeted black people just chilling in public) and then let them go a couple hours later with no charges (this was the \u201cincreasing police presence\u201d portion of the requirements) \n\nIt was so devastating to hear from a cop within this system who knew it was unjust but couldn\u2019t change it. No politicians wanted to be the person under whom crime statistics increased, and the public at large wasn\u2019t super aware. It ended up going to trial though. It was such a good listen I highly recommend it \n\n\n[Podcast part one](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vPVmqFCFxBZJpStDAHl2n?si=KUffn2rWQaCL3t0-kIYosg) and [Podcast part 2 ](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02uhOqpfshGwQZVpYrQFJi?si=LnQ5GBChS-e67YeoA5VRvQ)\n\nEdit: this was a ramble but I think what I was getting at is that it\u2019s totally fair to be wary of cops as a person of colour but also many cops are good people who are doing their best to continue being good people and good cops in a nonsensical and unfair system that disproportionately targets African Americans",

The kind of neighborhood where the contractors pulled into the secure garage opened their toolboxes and the first \"tool\" out was a large caliber pistol, the utility workers put on flack vests before climbing poles.  The victims were the young and old of all races, white, black, hispanic and asian . We had LAPD off duty officers working security because without them we could not get people to come to the building. The alley behind the building was filled with large cardboard boxes where crack addicted young women , many under 16 lived while they were pimped out by the gangs - tell me about how drug crimes are victimless crimes. \n\nLaw enforcement is not perfect but it is the last chance for many neighborhoods. So much of what you see on TV is driven by politics.  There's no mention of the thousands of small businesses, often owned by minorities,  that have been destroyed in riots across the nation, the many cities where the police are the thin blue line between civility and tribal anarchy. \n\nPolitics drives much of what you see on TV. Take Ferguson, Obama attacked the officer , the police and virtually incited riots that took lives and destroyed property .  Yet one Friday night after reporters had left for the weekend Obama's DOJ released its official report  finding that   \"Hands Up Don't Shoot never happened, the officer only shot when the \"little boy\"  (6'4\" and 290 pounds) advanced again on the officer whom he had attacked and struggled to get the officer's gun. The report further admitted that many of the \"witnesses\" so beloved by CNN and other networks lied and a number admitted that they were not even at the scene.  But the lies scarred our society and a generation's views of the police were moulded through a deliberately false story.  \n\nIf you look at 20 years of records for the 10 million people living in Los Angeles County (LA Times murder report)  a black homicide was less likely to have had any police involvement than a white homicide. What does stand out is the vast disparity in murder rates between races, especially among males.  The briefest review of FBI national crime stats also shows a huge disparity between the murder rates.  Tragically a young black man is probably 6 times more likely to die a violent death than a white male of similar age.  Instead of using fabricated events to divide America (and members of the sugar communities) we should be seeking common ground through looking at reality and asking what needs to be done.",

The very last person you want to be dating when things go south is a leo , especially in a sugar type of relationship where money has been exchanged.

And the issue exists beyond just the two of you - what if a colleague of his commits a racially-motivated crime? The chances of him siding with his coworker is far higher than him siding with you.\n\nI've had SDs with incompatible beliefs from mine, but those were all relationships with a little bit of distance. You being a SPG makes it sound like this is turning into more of an actual relationship. If things go downhill, it'll be much harder for you to get out. There will be very few places in the city for you to escape to. The apprehension you're feeling is completely warranted, imo. It doesn't seem like an overreaction to me. I'm not black, but if I found out that someone I was dating was a cop? I would also be uncomfortable. Also I'm like... why did he wait four months to tell you? That seems like something you'd want to get out of the way first, BEFORE starting a relationship. I get that he might be apprehensive or whatever, but that's all the more reason to be upfront about this.\n\nThere's already an inherent imbalance in sugar relationships. I'm not saying you should break it off with, but anything that tilts the power balance even MORE towards the sd is definitely something to be wary of.",

            "body": "first and foremost, your feelings are 100% VALID. Scrolling through this has been a bit disturbing as people are trying to invalidate your feelings or belittle them by repeating that \u201cnot all cops are bad\u201d. You\u2019ve already mentioned that you think not all cops are bad and yet that hasn\u2019t been enough to get over the fact that he\u2019s a cop.\n\nI\u2019m a POC but I\u2019m not African American, so therefore I will NEVER be able to understand what the AA community is going through in regards to police brutality, and it\u2019s all simply because I\u2019m not AA. If you\u2019re not AA, then what makes you think that you can tell someone who has had to witness the brutal murders of the people of their community in the hands of police officers to not be anxious around the police? With that being said, the amount of people on here who are trying to create \u201cmetaphors\u201d based on your issue as if to reduce it down to something smaller is astounding. You\u2019ve had to watch news reports of hate crimes committed by police officers to the people of your community. African Americans have been killed by the police and it has drastically affected you and your community, so, yes, your feelings are valid. The fact that some people think that you don\u2019t have the right to feel even a bit wary is astounding. My best friend is AA and the murder of George Floyd affected her greatly. And I listened to her voice her anger and fear towards cops and never did I think to belittle her concerns. \n\nSo, yeah, my biggest advice here is to embrace your feelings. They exist for a reason. If you want to keep pursuing a relationship with him, then communication is key. As a 19 year old, it\u2019s disappointing to see that there\u2019s full grown adults telling you to ignore it/brush it under the rug and just jump back to how things used to be without addressing this with him. Then again, if you don\u2019t feel comfortable around him anymore, then can things really go back to how they used to be? It\u2019s a sensitive topic, obviously. Getting back together with him and ignoring this big elephant in the room will only lead to it toppling over you both to completely suffocate you under its weight. \n\nIf you decide to continue seeing him, I think that the best thing you can do is meet up some place where YOU feel comfortable and safe and talk it out. Whenever I\u2019m overwhelmed with a problem, I take a blank sheet of paper and just start writing down absolutely anything that comes to mind. It doesn\u2019t have to be perfect but I just like getting it all out of my head and on the paper. The paper\u2019s all messy by the end and yet it doesn\u2019t stop it from giving me an outlet to start connecting things and to form a goal that I want to accomplish and hopefully solve my dilema. Ranting out loud in front of a mirror helps too lol. Get angry. Get sad. It\u2019s a process but taking the first step by doing something small like this can be incredibly relieving and lead to the answer that you\u2019re seeking. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve watched Orange is the New Black but the theme song quotes something along the lines of \u201ctaking steps is easy, standing still is hard.\u201d \n\nPoint is, get to understand your feelings and what you want to say to him IF you decide to talk to him again. You have to know where you stand first before you decide where he stands in your life. \n\nI wish you the best of luck, honestly! Don\u2019t let anyone make you feel bad for having these doubts. Your feelings are 100% valid.",

            "body": "I completey understand how you feel, and where you're coming from. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do think that there is some cognitive dissonance going on. You met a person you clicked with and thought was wonderful. THEN you found out he was a cop - \"cop\" being a title you have A LOT of associations, feelings, opinions tied to, and all or mostly bad. \n\nIt's like finding out your sweet best friend, your wonderful sibling, your amazing parents are the serial killer you keep hearing about on the news. You can't reconcile the person you know (or thought you knew) with this new information you're getting. You have one reality: my best friend. And then you're hit with another reality: a serial killer. And these two realities seem to inhabit the same person. How can you reconcile that?\n\nI think that in this case, IF you want to continue seeing him, you have to remind yourself that despite all the horrible things that cops CAN do, their sole function isn't to oppress people, especially minorities. Yes, unfortunately, many cops exploit their power, twist it, and use it for bad purposes. But a bad cop is a BAD HUMAN BEING who is exploiting his position of being a cop. Just the position itself does not make a person a violent racist/bigot. The person already has to be bigoted, filled with anger and hate, and have violent tendencies, and THEN when that person gets into the position of cop, he exploits that position to oppress others. What I am trying to get at is that not all cops are bad people, but all of the bad cops are bad people. There are good cops - of all races and genders. The systemic racism goes way above cops. Cops don't write the laws, cops didn't put into law the 1994 crime bill which is the crime laws we have now that disproportionately target minorities for silly violations and expanded the prison and prison-labor system. Of course, racist cops benefit from the system. But there are good cops - people who truly want to serve their communities. \n\nSo just because your SD is a cop, doesn't mean he's a bad person. And it sounds like he's a good person and you have had a wonderful relationship up till now. Of course, if him being a cop bothers you, you are under no obligation to try to \"get over it\" and continue seeing him. You don't have to force yourself to swallow something that is a very touchy subject for you. At the end of the day, it comes down 100% to how you feel - regardless of whether others tell you your feelings are valid or not. If you don't want to be with someone, you don't want to be with them.\n\nHe did lie by omission to you about being a cop, but in SR I feel like lying is kind of par for the course, and is in some ways part of the deal. Only you can decide if this is a lie that was \"part of the sugar relationship deal\" or something more significant to you. \n\nOne thing that I'm a little puzzled by is the fact that you're ok with him being in the military, but not with him being a cop. If cops are an extension of systematic racism, soldiers are even more so. Soldiers, even more so than cops, are part of the \"system\" that we have established is racist and violent. But we as Americans don't really come in contact with the military, because the military tends to do its considerable oppression (including committing crimes against humanity and breaking international war laws) overseas, so I guess it's easy to feel \"ok\" about the military because **we** haven't personally felt (someone else has, in a place far, far away) the brunt of their violence, racism, and misogyny - and the media doesn't report on it. The US military has waged many questionable operations, destabilizing entire regions, wreaking havoc in them and for the native populations, instating US-backed dictators, arming rebels, then fighting those dictators and rebels when the latter turned against US interests, waging regime-change wars for decades, etc. Yeah, you can argue the US had to do that for the good of the US, but the fact remains our military has an enormous amount of blood on its hands. Of course, the US military has done some good, but it certainly is part of systemic oppression. And of course, not all soldiers are bad. Not all soldiers torture, rape (men, women, and children), and kill civilians of other countries while calling them the most horrible racist names. Not all male soldiers rape female military members (rates of rape in the military are astronomical), not all soldiers are homophobic (despite homophobia being systematized in the military). \n\nFrom the little I know of your SD, he seems like a nice man, despite being both a soldier and a cop. But it doesn't matter how \"nice\" or how much of a \"good person\" he is - all that matters is how YOU feel. Relationships aren't jobs - they're based on how you feel. You don't have to rationalize or explain to anyone why you do or don't want to be with someone. I mean, if you decide you can't be with this SD, I do think it would be common courtesy to let him know that you just can't get past his profession. But you don't have to go into long conversations with him, or anyone else about it. You don't owe anyone else an explanation. Ultimately, you have to go with your heart and your gut.",

Him being a cop on top of that was kinda a double whammy here. \n\nI know Lying is part of the SR, I did the first 2.5months about my name and a good amount of other info so I respect the privacy I just wish he would've told me sooner I guess before I was this emotionally invested. \n\nBUT what you said in the beginning is 100% how I feel. Mentally I can separate the fact that his character has shown me otherwise, only time will tell I suppose if emotionally I'm able to continue if that makes sense. If being in his presence now incites/triggers some anxiety and things (uncontrollably) when I get in his presence I know its going to ruin the Dynamic of things & I'll really have no choice but to end",

As women we often feel like we have to \"deal with\" things, or that something \"isn't a big deal\" and we should just \"get over it\"  etc. No! You want what you want, and you don't want what you don't want, and you should go by THAT! Most men and probably all sugar daddies go by that - they don't entertain anything that they aren't 100% into, regardless of how rational or irrational it is (and many times, it's something completely silly, whereas women tend to feel like they have to put with more significant issues). You do what's best for you. Sugar relationships are supposed to HELP you, not make you feel worse and acquire even more insecurities, anxiety, etc.\n\nAt the end of the day, you are a young beautiful woman with her future ahead of her. This SD is a tiny part of it, and is from the get-go designed to not be a serious part or stable part of your life. Don't do something that might be harmful to you, just to temporarily get some middle-aged dude's rocks off, especially if all you're getting out of it is some mani-pedis and an occasional trip to another state.",

Even if this was vanilla I would be nervous to share simply bc there are stats to back up domestic violence with cops.

I know plenty of good cops have helped our communities but it only takes one to do damage in my life.  if this SD happens to be that one I'm f*cked. \n\nIf you took a poll asking the AA if law enforcement incited some level of anxiety there would be a small percentage that said no. \n\nMy feelings are not ridiculous.

On the outside this made it so that politicians could say \u201ccrime is going down\u201d under their governance, when in reality it was just being underreported (this was SUPER bad - like rape victims were in many cases unable to convict their rapists!!). It also led to police being encouraged/forced by their superiors to arrest people who fitted the visual profile of someone who committed a crime in the area (this disproportionally targeted black people just chilling in public) and then let them go a couple hours later with no charges (this was the \u201cincreasing police presence\u201d portion of the requirements) \n\nIt was so devastating to hear from a cop within this system who knew it was unjust but couldn\u2019t change it. No politicians wanted to be the person under whom crime statistics increased, and the public at large wasn\u2019t super aware. It ended up going to trial though. It was such a good listen I highly recommend it \n\n\n[Podcast part one](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7vPVmqFCFxBZJpStDAHl2n?si=KUffn2rWQaCL3t0-kIYosg) and [Podcast part 2 ](https://open.spotify.com/episode/02uhOqpfshGwQZVpYrQFJi?si=LnQ5GBChS-e67YeoA5VRvQ)\n\nEdit: this was a ramble but I think what I was getting at is that it\u2019s totally fair to be wary of cops as a person of colour but also many cops are good people who are doing their best to continue being good people and good cops in a nonsensical and unfair system that disproportionately targets African Americans",

The kind of neighborhood where the contractors pulled into the secure garage opened their toolboxes and the first \"tool\" out was a large caliber pistol, the utility workers put on flack vests before climbing poles.  The victims were the young and old of all races, white, black, hispanic and asian . We had LAPD off duty officers working security because without them we could not get people to come to the building. The alley behind the building was filled with large cardboard boxes where crack addicted young women , many under 16 lived while they were pimped out by the gangs - tell me about how drug crimes are victimless crimes. \n\nLaw enforcement is not perfect but it is the last chance for many neighborhoods. So much of what you see on TV is driven by politics.  There's no mention of the thousands of small businesses, often owned by minorities,  that have been destroyed in riots across the nation, the many cities where the police are the thin blue line between civility and tribal anarchy. \n\nPolitics drives much of what you see on TV. Take Ferguson, Obama attacked the officer , the police and virtually incited riots that took lives and destroyed property .  Yet one Friday night after reporters had left for the weekend Obama's DOJ released its official report  finding that   \"Hands Up Don't Shoot never happened, the officer only shot when the \"little boy\"  (6'4\" and 290 pounds) advanced again on the officer whom he had attacked and struggled to get the officer's gun. The report further admitted that many of the \"witnesses\" so beloved by CNN and other networks lied and a number admitted that they were not even at the scene.  But the lies scarred our society and a generation's views of the police were moulded through a deliberately false story.  \n\nIf you look at 20 years of records for the 10 million people living in Los Angeles County (LA Times murder report)  a black homicide was less likely to have had any police involvement than a white homicide. What does stand out is the vast disparity in murder rates between races, especially among males.  The briefest review of FBI national crime stats also shows a huge disparity between the murder rates.  Tragically a young black man is probably 6 times more likely to die a violent death than a white male of similar age.  Instead of using fabricated events to divide America (and members of the sugar communities) we should be seeking common ground through looking at reality and asking what needs to be done.",

Mentally I can separate the fact that his character has shown me otherwise, only time will tell I suppose if emotionally I'm able to continue if that makes sense.

As women we often feel like we have to \"deal with\" things, or that something \"isn't a big deal\" and we should just \"get over it\"  etc. No! You want what you want, and you don't want what you don't want, and you should go by THAT! Most men and probably all sugar daddies go by that - they don't entertain anything that they aren't 100% into, regardless of how rational or irrational it is (and many times, it's something completely silly, whereas women tend to feel like they have to put with more significant issues). You do what's best for you.

I am honestly not crazy about him being in the military, that was something I already have had to come to grips with and learn to be okay with.

Them being the same color gives me more hope that they might be on my side. \n\nI'm not a fan of any government jobs, him being in the Army was something I've already had to learn to be okay with. \n\nMy friends and family dont know anything about him and I dont plan on telling them about this side of my life. BUT the last thing I would want at the same time would be for them to find out on the news because something happened to me. \n\nWhen he asked for my friends and family opinions we were talking in a general sense. I took it as would I date a cop in general as in SR or vanilla and if I would tell. Even if this was vanilla I would be nervous to share simply bc there are stats to back up domestic violence with cops. If he happened to be white on top of that it would just raise more concern. \n\nWhile I do respect privacy, as I kept my real name and other info quiet for the first 2.5months I wouldve appreciated him telling me sooner. Its clear he understood how the AA feels about the profession which is why he was nervous to tell me. He should've just gotten it out of the way before either of us got emotionally invested. \n\nthis bias comes from the every day challenges of not only being a woman but an AA one at that. \n\nI've first hand had bad experiences with cops and they didnt know anything about me. I have opened up parts of my life to him. IF things go south he has a lot more leverage over me than a typical SD would & AA's dont get to go on mass murdering sprees and walk away like we've seen happen multiple times for white males. Black males cant even survive a simple arrest. \n\nYes I know the stats dont apply to everyone. I know plenty of good cops have helped our communities but it only takes one to do damage in my life.  if this SD happens to be that one I'm f*cked. \n\nIf you took a poll asking the AA if law enforcement incited some level of anxiety there would be a small percentage that said no. \n\nMy feelings are not ridiculous. They're backed up just like yours are.",

The kind of neighborhood where the contractors pulled into the secure garage opened their toolboxes and the first \"tool\" out was a large caliber pistol, the utility workers put on flack vests before climbing poles.  The victims were the young and old of all races, white, black, hispanic and asian . We had LAPD off duty officers working security because without them we could not get people to come to the building. The alley behind the building was filled with large cardboard boxes where crack addicted young women , many under 16 lived while they were pimped out by the gangs - tell me about how drug crimes are victimless crimes. \n\nLaw enforcement is not perfect but it is the last chance for many neighborhoods. So much of what you see on TV is driven by politics.  There's no mention of the thousands of small businesses, often owned by minorities,  that have been destroyed in riots across the nation, the many cities where the police are the thin blue line between civility and tribal anarchy. \n\nPolitics drives much of what you see on TV. Take Ferguson, Obama attacked the officer , the police and virtually incited riots that took lives and destroyed property .  Yet one Friday night after reporters had left for the weekend Obama's DOJ released its official report  finding that   \"Hands Up Don't Shoot never happened, the officer only shot when the \"little boy\"  (6'4\" and 290 pounds) advanced again on the officer whom he had attacked and struggled to get the officer's gun. The report further admitted that many of the \"witnesses\" so beloved by CNN and other networks lied and a number admitted that they were not even at the scene.  But the lies scarred our society and a generation's views of the police were moulded through a deliberately false story.  \n\nIf you look at 20 years of records for the 10 million people living in Los Angeles County (LA Times murder report)  a black homicide was less likely to have had any police involvement than a white homicide. What does stand out is the vast disparity in murder rates between races, especially among males.  The briefest review of FBI national crime stats also shows a huge disparity between the murder rates.  Tragically a young black man is probably 6 times more likely to die a violent death than a white male of similar age.

As women we often feel like we have to \"deal with\" things, or that something \"isn't a big deal\" and we should just \"get over it\"  etc. No! You want what you want, and you don't want what you don't want, and you should go by THAT! Most men and probably all sugar daddies go by that - they don't entertain anything that they aren't 100% into, regardless of how rational or irrational it is (and many times, it's something completely silly, whereas women tend to feel like they have to put with more significant issues). You do what's best for you. Sugar relationships are supposed to HELP you, not make you feel worse and acquire even more insecurities, anxiety, etc.\n\nAt the end of the day, you are a young beautiful woman with her future ahead of her.

                    "body": "I have no connection to law enforcement other than having spent a lot of time with them trying to improve part of a Pico Union neighborhood in LA  in the middle of a crack epidemic. The kind of neighborhood where the contractors pulled into the secure garage opened their toolboxes and the first \"tool\" out was a large caliber pistol, the utility workers put on flack vests before climbing poles.  The victims were the young and old of all races, white, black, hispanic and asian . We had LAPD off duty officers working security because without them we could not get people to come to the building. The alley behind the building was filled with large cardboard boxes where crack addicted young women , many under 16 lived while they were pimped out by the gangs - tell me about how drug crimes are victimless crimes. \n\nLaw enforcement is not perfect but it is the last chance for many neighborhoods. So much of what you see on TV is driven by politics.  There's no mention of the thousands of small businesses, often owned by minorities,  that have been destroyed in riots across the nation, the many cities where the police are the thin blue line between civility and tribal anarchy. \n\nPolitics drives much of what you see on TV. Take Ferguson, Obama attacked the officer , the police and virtually incited riots that took lives and destroyed property .  Yet one Friday night after reporters had left for the weekend Obama's DOJ released its official report  finding that   \"Hands Up Don't Shoot never happened, the officer only shot when the \"little boy\"  (6'4\" and 290 pounds) advanced again on the officer whom he had attacked and struggled to get the officer's gun. The report further admitted that many of the \"witnesses\" so beloved by CNN and other networks lied and a number admitted that they were not even at the scene.  But the lies scarred our society and a generation's views of the police were moulded through a deliberately false story.  \n\nIf you look at 20 years of records for the 10 million people living in Los Angeles County (LA Times murder report)  a black homicide was less likely to have had any police involvement than a white homicide. What does stand out is the vast disparity in murder rates between races, especially among males.  The briefest review of FBI national crime stats also shows a huge disparity between the murder rates.  Tragically a young black man is probably 6 times more likely to die a violent death than a white male of similar age.  Instead of using fabricated events to divide America (and members of the sugar communities) we should be seeking common ground through looking at reality and asking what needs to be done.",

            "body": "I have no connection to law enforcement other than having spent a lot of time with them trying to improve part of a Pico Union neighborhood in LA  in the middle of a crack epidemic. The kind of neighborhood where the contractors pulled into the secure garage opened their toolboxes and the first \"tool\" out was a large caliber pistol, the utility workers put on flack vests before climbing poles.  The victims were the young and old of all races, white, black, hispanic and asian . We had LAPD off duty officers working security because without them we could not get people to come to the building. The alley behind the building was filled with large cardboard boxes where crack addicted young women , many under 16 lived while they were pimped out by the gangs - tell me about how drug crimes are victimless crimes. \n\nLaw enforcement is not perfect but it is the last chance for many neighborhoods. So much of what you see on TV is driven by politics.  There's no mention of the thousands of small businesses, often owned by minorities,  that have been destroyed in riots across the nation, the many cities where the police are the thin blue line between civility and tribal anarchy. \n\nPolitics drives much of what you see on TV. Take Ferguson, Obama attacked the officer , the police and virtually incited riots that took lives and destroyed property .  Yet one Friday night after reporters had left for the weekend Obama's DOJ released its official report  finding that   \"Hands Up Don't Shoot never happened, the officer only shot when the \"little boy\"  (6'4\" and 290 pounds) advanced again on the officer whom he had attacked and struggled to get the officer's gun. The report further admitted that many of the \"witnesses\" so beloved by CNN and other networks lied and a number admitted that they were not even at the scene.  But the lies scarred our society and a generation's views of the police were moulded through a deliberately false story.  \n\nIf you look at 20 years of records for the 10 million people living in Los Angeles County (LA Times murder report)  a black homicide was less likely to have had any police involvement than a white homicide. What does stand out is the vast disparity in murder rates between races, especially among males.  The briefest review of FBI national crime stats also shows a huge disparity between the murder rates.  Tragically a young black man is probably 6 times more likely to die a violent death than a white male of similar age.  Instead of using fabricated events to divide America (and members of the sugar communities) we should be seeking common ground through looking at reality and asking what needs to be done.",

I\u2019ve been in relationships like that before and they usually show their colors after a month or two and there are usually red flags before that...but we don\u2019t know anything about this man and as of right now op is not a victim of anything. My only point about the 4 months is that his profession doesn\u2019t make him a bad person and if his behavior hasn\u2019t shown anything negative there\u2019s no reason to assume he will be down the line, at least not any more than any other person in a relationship",

Because you basically say you believe that there is a faceless, nameless group that run the system that is out to get you.
