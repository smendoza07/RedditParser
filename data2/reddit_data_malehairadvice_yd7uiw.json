I will definitely grow to a stubble, and i didnt mention that i am on finasteride and minoxidil so that confuses some. I just really hate seeing my hairline. Always been an overthinker. Hat slave for a year and a half as well, following cystic acne as a teenager fixed by accutane.  not trying to victim claim i hate that just trying to leave a better insight as to why I am generally self conscious about my appearance. Developed that way i suppose. I appreciate all tips and comments",

I had horrible acne as a teen and still deal with occasional cystic breakouts in my 30s( I\u2019ve been in the last 2 months, just started sone medication. Absolutely sucks) \n\nSomething though that took me a long time to realize is the things I was self conscious about my self are things people don\u2019t actually notice about me or really care unless I point them out. It\u2019s all in your head really. When you\u2019re young people can absolutely suck, but that\u2019s just because they\u2019re in the same shitty boat. You\u2019re genuinely a handsome guy(that\u2019s not just me, but my wife too) so don\u2019t get down about hairline it\u2019s distinguished and gives you a cool kinda stoic vibe.",

Solid.\n\nAlthough, you really don't look bad with a widow's peak bro. You just need a different style if you're gonna grow it. In that last pic your hair is at a really weird length - you could easily buzz it a little longer and I think it would be fine. Or you could try and rock a mohawk at basically any length, if that whole punk/rocker look is your style.",

I read through some earlier posts and can't imagine what you've been going through, especially with that added emotional stress. Keep your head up King.\n\n  You definitely made the right choice shaving. Unless you want to dump a shit ton of money on decent plugs, it's best to just embrace the chrome dome. You were holding your phone at a relatively low angle and the phone lens could be stretching the appearance of your lens. Camera position and lens can be the difference between skeleton man and Handsome Squidward. \n\n  The stubble coupled with the hairline gives too much of an old man vibe for a young guy. You've got a good jaw, but if you wanted to balance out the bald head, definitely grow a beard. If your beard is patchy just bear with it and let it grow, it often takes a while to fill out in certain sections. Brushing with a nice brush or comb can also help train the hair to grow in the right direction, as well as maybe stimulating growth.  \n\n\n  Peace and Love, Peace and Love",

I will definitely grow to a stubble, and i didnt mention that i am on finasteride and minoxidil so that confuses some. I just really hate seeing my hairline. Always been an overthinker. Hat slave for a year and a half as well, following cystic acne as a teenager fixed by accutane.  not trying to victim claim i hate that just trying to leave a better insight as to why I am generally self conscious about my appearance. Developed that way i suppose. I appreciate all tips and comments",

I had horrible acne as a teen and still deal with occasional cystic breakouts in my 30s( I\u2019ve been in the last 2 months, just started sone medication. Absolutely sucks) \n\nSomething though that took me a long time to realize is the things I was self conscious about my self are things people don\u2019t actually notice about me or really care unless I point them out. It\u2019s all in your head really. When you\u2019re young people can absolutely suck, but that\u2019s just because they\u2019re in the same shitty boat. You\u2019re genuinely a handsome guy(that\u2019s not just me, but my wife too) so don\u2019t get down about hairline it\u2019s distinguished and gives you a cool kinda stoic vibe.",

I had horrible acne as a teen and still deal with occasional cystic breakouts in my 30s( I\u2019ve been in the last 2 months, just started sone medication. Absolutely sucks) \n\nSomething though that took me a long time to realize is the things I was self conscious about my self are things people don\u2019t actually notice about me or really care unless I point them out. It\u2019s all in your head really. When you\u2019re young people can absolutely suck, but that\u2019s just because they\u2019re in the same shitty boat. You\u2019re genuinely a handsome guy(that\u2019s not just me, but my wife too) so don\u2019t get down about hairline it\u2019s distinguished and gives you a cool kinda stoic vibe.",
