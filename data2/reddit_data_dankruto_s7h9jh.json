Bit ass-pulley still but would have been cool if it just saves you from those 1-strike lethal attacks. Not prevent harm, but at least stop you dying. And then I would have been cool with Uchiha\u2019s just being more evasive and skillful than they already are so that they didn\u2019t take damage as frequently in fights, but when they did - it was a problem. \n\nI mean, I get Sasuke has always been fast, but why is he as fast as Naruto?  I wish they would atleast explain it by saying it\u2019s caused by some form of lightning release or something. He doesn\u2019t have the same destructive output, but his physical strength is pretty much the same - but Naruto needs Sage mode to truly express his strength too. \n\nThe fact that spamming the Mangekyo sharingan caused ninja aids and reduced your vision was a good balance. It at least made sense that they was trading life-force and their ability that made them OP in the first place for all of that extra strength and the hacks abilities. But then EMS just made any Uchiha ridiculously OP. \n\nIdk, Naruto is still stronger, but he needs half of the strongest Biju by far, and sage mode - and Sasuke is still literally only one step behind him. \n\nAlthough, you could argue that before Sasuke recieved the Rinnegan from Hagoromo, Naruto was on a different level to Sasuke, as evident by his frustration in witnessing Naruto\u2019s growth when Sasuke joined the war.",

Or maybe only when Madara uses his Rinnegan, it becomes a fusion of his EMS and Rinnegan. Such wasted potential with his EMS",

Space Chakra God? Really? That's the worst grand reveal I've ever seen.\n\n\nToo see everything wrong with Shippuden, think about the difference between Minato, who was a WAR HERO AND HOKAGE.

He sets off a nuclear bomb, can transform into mutiple forms, create an army of himself, and to boot he's the reincarnation of a seemingly important character that was introduced in the last arcs CONCLUSION.",

It had more strategy, and actual strategy, not \"Haha fake clone\" nonsense, it reduced the usage of literal plot holes OP techniques like Substitution Jutsu or transformation Jutsu which the first part is filled with. Original Naruto is nothing but BS forced strategy over and over again, a guy like Iruka can be alright after taking a giant Shuriken in his back but a mercenary like Zabuza HAS to dodge a fucking Kunai thrown at him by a kid (If he could've hold on to his water bubble for longer, Kakashi was dead but plot), or how about just like how he jumped to dodge it the first time, this time get down to dodge it? The Chunnin Exams are filled with trash fight left and right, Naruto vs Kiba, Ino vs Sakura, Rock Lee vs Gaara is nothing but power creep DBZ melodrama of punches and kicks, no actual strategy. Neji vs Naruto sucked, the only good moment was Naruto's uppercut moment, Gaara vs Sasuke was terrible with big neck Sasuke needed an entire fucking episode to charge ONE chidori, no strategy in that fight either. Talking about forced strategy, Shika vs Temari is the perfect example of it, she could've easily spammed her fan throughout the fight but only uses it ONCE and never again, who fights like this? It's not like she has a finisher cool down to wait for. \n\nI don't get how Tailed beasts (which were expanded upon again, if they have two in OG, why can't they have more?) or Chakra natures, are such big problems(which like you said was only for an arc, nothing major), if things which are getting expanded upon from OG Naruto's lore are \"show horned\" for you, then would you call pulling out a DBZ butterfly pill out of thin air at the very convenient moment which didn't even had any lore to begin with?\n\nAnd I didn't said Shippuden was flawless, as terrible as Kaguya reveal was, at the very least the show had actual good moments, high highs like Itachi vs Sasuke, Pain arc, or The tale of Jiraya the Gallant which is enough to put the entire OG to shame which barely has anything memorable at all or enjoyable.",

Oh Naruto had AT least SOME traps and tricks that made sense. \n\nFine then do mention how OG Naruto is more strategic. Here's what I can remember from Shippuden.\n\n\nSasuke tricking Danzo into believing he had one more eye open at 5 Kage Summit\n\nMinato cleverly outspeeding Obito\n\nNaruto having to deduct how to hurt 3rd Raikage with very little info and make him stab himself\n\nDarui had to deduct how the sealing weapons that the gold and silver brothers had worked and outsmart them (the fight was lame but it was still based on strategy than bigger Jutsu)\n\nGaara using real like chemistry and temperature properties to beat Mizukage's exploding steam clone\n\nThe entire first half of the fight against masked Obito and Naruto/Guy/Bee/Kakashi having to deduce how Kamui worked and how they could exploit it's weakness.\n\nKakashi pinning Obito's hand with Kunai saving him from Lava dimension\n\nNaruto sending his nature energy to One of Pain's causing him to turn into a rock\n\nNaruto using his shadow clones to close of the distance with Pain and also withstanding the force of Pain's almighty push and cancelling it out by having his Clones stand behind him. Naruto leaving clones to gather more Nature energy, Storing and using nature chakra requires a person to sit still and meditate to draw it in. This makes it difficult to use in battle, but Naruto used his proficiency with shadow clones as a work around. While he went off to battle Pain, he left behind a couple of clones who were constantly meditating and\u00a0storing Sage Chakra. When Naruto's sage mode ran out of time, he would recall one of the clones and all of the nature chakra would flow into his original body.\n\nShikamaru's entire fight is just him heavenly relying on strategy against Hidan.\n\nSasuke vs Itachi was all tricking each other by substitution, using Ninja tools, Sasuke using his fireball to increase the temperature of the atmosphere making thunderclouds to use as Less chakra as possible to create Kirin.\n\nObito vs Kakashi.\n\nJiraiya vs 6 Paths of Pain was completely based on stealth.\n\nSasuke using a massive fireball Jutsu keeping Naruto busy while handling the Giant ball while he switches places with one of The truth seeking balls, Sasuke using Amaterasu which gets countered by Naruto covering his body with Kurama's Chakra and disowning that Chakra, Naruto leaving his clones to gather Nature energy. \n\nSasori vs Sakura is another underrated fight tbh in terms of how well thought out and unique it was with brilliantly matching with Chiyo's puppet powers and Sakura's strength, countering Sasori's position with Antidote she created. \n\nSasuke deactivated the land mines by channeling lightning through his katana, Deidara thought it coincidence but Sasuke had been making observations that his detonating clay (which is an earth style technique) was weak against lightning. Also, the part where Deidara feigned being under genjutsu, great fight.\n\n\nMany other fights like Gaara vs Deidara, where Deidara sacrificed an arm to put bombs in Gaara's sand, district him using C3 so he can force him to cover himself with the sand he previously infused bomb inside. Konan setting up the trap of million paper bomb.\n\nNaruto and Sasuke vs Kaguya: Using clones (Sasuke was hiding behind two) to bamboozle Kaguya to get into a position to seal her. Reverse Sexy Jutsu, enough said. Tricking Kaguya by attacking truth seeker balls to a fake clone she thinks that clone is the real Naruto.\n\nEven Might Guy vs Madara, Strategy used by Minato, Lee and Gaara, using teamwork to their advantage.\n\nI don't remember OG Naruto having this much strategy at all.",

The sharingan illuminates the inner world of a person. The Sharingan copies movements and jutsu by seeing the opponent's inner chakra intention before the opponent actually makes a physical movement. This is why it can \"see the future\".\nIlluminating the inner world of a person is analogous to reflecting the person's inner desire. And that's what Sharingan are said in the story too - \"eyes which reflect the heart\"\n\nMangekyou Sharingan's ability are consistent (borrowing a comment from u/ sonfoa as they have already explained it well) \n\nFor Sasuke his MS powers signify his hatred (Amaterasu) and the target of that hatred (Inferno Style) which changes throughout the series. \n\n(Tho my take on his ability is slightly different. I think Flame Control is more to highlight that behind the hatred, their is a kind soul left inside of him) \n\nFor Itachi it signifies how he appears to the world (Amaterasu) but that is an illusion that he wants people to see (Tsukuyomi).\n\nFor Obito it signifies his desire to not exist in this world (Kamui: intagibility and dimensional travel).\n\nFor Kakashi it signifies his desire to escape from his past (Kamui: dimensional banishment) \n\nKishimoto has crafted the power system with sharingan and Byakugan in such a way that there is a whole other narrative related to the duality of those two and how it connects to the overall lore of the creation of chakra in the world, and fans are \"muh Kishimoto hard for Uchiha\" instead of looking at the themes and narrative he has cover and constructed with those, which are rarely available in any other fantasy fiction I have read, regardless of medium.",

Just because he wrote their abilities really well doesnt means that he didnt make the mistake of focusing too much on them in Shippuden. Shippuden should have focused more on the Jinchurikis rather than making everything about Uchihas. I honestly loved Shippuden and the direction in which it was going till the Pain Arc but I didnt liked the story that much after it. Also, by giving a bit less importance to the Uchihas ( especially Sasuke ), Kishimoto could have written Naruto's character a lot better too as can be seen from the Pain Arc and war Arc when Naruto as a character was at his best imo.",

Also for Naruto's character, I don't see why one would find him badly written. Naruto's character arc works very well with the duality he presented with Sasuke's character arc and colliding them at the end in the final valley fight. I would suggest you to watch these two video if you haven't already. He explains more than what I could ever interptet.\n\n  https://youtu.be/g0BtpRusxWU\n\nAnd about how Sharingan and Mangekyou contribute to the large scale of things in Narutoberse with the theme it encompasses: \n\nhttps://youtu.be/JmUgmWzWiRU",

Gaara\u2019s sealing jutsu could have been a lot less advanced. \n\nBut I get what you mean. Makes no sense why Gaara was able to go to sleep and be a happier kid after his encounter with Naruto. \n\nMaybe it was just Shukaku tormenting Gaara and scaring him that allowed him to exploit his emotions and go on those rampages. Maybe it wasn\u2019t actually sleeping that was the problem, but rather it was the belief Shukaku needed to instil into Gaara to be able to temporarily release himself.

Not prevent harm, but at least stop you dying. And then I would have been cool with Uchiha\u2019s just being more evasive and skillful than they already are so that they didn\u2019t take damage as frequently in fights, but when they did - it was a problem. \n\nI mean, I get Sasuke has always been fast, but why is he as fast as Naruto?  I wish they would atleast explain it by saying it\u2019s caused by some form of lightning release or something. He doesn\u2019t have the same destructive output, but his physical strength is pretty much the same - but Naruto needs Sage mode to truly express his strength too. \n\nThe fact that spamming the Mangekyo sharingan caused ninja aids and reduced your vision was a good balance. It at least made sense that they was trading life-force and their ability that made them OP in the first place for all of that extra strength and the hacks abilities. But then EMS just made any Uchiha ridiculously OP. \n\nIdk, Naruto is still stronger, but he needs half of the strongest Biju by far, and sage mode - and Sasuke is still literally only one step behind him. \n\nAlthough, you could argue that before Sasuke recieved the Rinnegan from Hagoromo, Naruto was on a different level to Sasuke, as evident by his frustration in witnessing Naruto\u2019s growth when Sasuke joined the war.",

Space Chakra God? Really? That's the worst grand reveal I've ever seen.\n\n\nToo see everything wrong with Shippuden, think about the difference between Minato, who was a WAR HERO AND HOKAGE. His entire kit was teleporting around.\n\nNaruto? He sets off a nuclear bomb, can transform into mutiple forms, create an army of himself, and to boot he's the reincarnation of a seemingly important character that was introduced in the last arcs CONCLUSION.",

The Chunnin Exams are filled with trash fight left and right, Naruto vs Kiba, Ino vs Sakura, Rock Lee vs Gaara is nothing but power creep DBZ melodrama of punches and kicks, no actual strategy. Neji vs Naruto sucked, the only good moment was Naruto's uppercut moment, Gaara vs Sasuke was terrible with big neck Sasuke needed an entire fucking episode to charge ONE chidori, no strategy in that fight either. Talking about forced strategy, Shika vs Temari is the perfect example of it, she could've easily spammed her fan throughout the fight but only uses it ONCE and never again, who fights like this? It's not like she has a finisher cool down to wait for. \n\nI don't get how Tailed beasts (which were expanded upon again, if they have two in OG, why can't they have more?) or Chakra natures, are such big problems(which like you said was only for an arc, nothing major), if things which are getting expanded upon from OG Naruto's lore are \"show horned\" for you, then would you call pulling out a DBZ butterfly pill out of thin air at the very convenient moment which didn't even had any lore to begin with?\n\nAnd I didn't said Shippuden was flawless, as terrible as Kaguya reveal was, at the very least the show had actual good moments, high highs like Itachi vs Sasuke, Pain arc, or The tale of Jiraya the Gallant which is enough to put the entire OG to shame which barely has anything memorable at all or enjoyable.",

Oh Naruto had AT least SOME traps and tricks that made sense. \n\nFine then do mention how OG Naruto is more strategic. Here's what I can remember from Shippuden.\n\n\nSasuke tricking Danzo into believing he had one more eye open at 5 Kage Summit\n\nMinato cleverly outspeeding Obito\n\nNaruto having to deduct how to hurt 3rd Raikage with very little info and make him stab himself\n\nDarui had to deduct how the sealing weapons that the gold and silver brothers had worked and outsmart them (the fight was lame but it was still based on strategy than bigger Jutsu)\n\nGaara using real like chemistry and temperature properties to beat Mizukage's exploding steam clone\n\nThe entire first half of the fight against masked Obito and Naruto/Guy/Bee/Kakashi having to deduce how Kamui worked and how they could exploit it's weakness.\n\nKakashi pinning Obito's hand with Kunai saving him from Lava dimension\n\nNaruto sending his nature energy to One of Pain's causing him to turn into a rock\n\nNaruto using his shadow clones to close of the distance with Pain and also withstanding the force of Pain's almighty push and cancelling it out by having his Clones stand behind him. Naruto leaving clones to gather more Nature energy, Storing and using nature chakra requires a person to sit still and meditate to draw it in. This makes it difficult to use in battle, but Naruto used his proficiency with shadow clones as a work around. While he went off to battle Pain, he left behind a couple of clones who were constantly meditating and\u00a0storing Sage Chakra. When Naruto's sage mode ran out of time, he would recall one of the clones and all of the nature chakra would flow into his original body.\n\nShikamaru's entire fight is just him heavenly relying on strategy against Hidan.\n\nSasuke vs Itachi was all tricking each other by substitution, using Ninja tools, Sasuke using his fireball to increase the temperature of the atmosphere making thunderclouds to use as Less chakra as possible to create Kirin.\n\nObito vs Kakashi.\n\nJiraiya vs 6 Paths of Pain was completely based on stealth.\n\nSasuke using a massive fireball Jutsu keeping Naruto busy while handling the Giant ball while he switches places with one of The truth seeking balls, Sasuke using Amaterasu which gets countered by Naruto covering his body with Kurama's Chakra and disowning that Chakra, Naruto leaving his clones to gather Nature energy. \n\nSasori vs Sakura is another underrated fight tbh in terms of how well thought out and unique it was with brilliantly matching with Chiyo's puppet powers and Sakura's strength, countering Sasori's position with Antidote she created. \n\nSasuke deactivated the land mines by channeling lightning through his katana, Deidara thought it coincidence but Sasuke had been making observations that his detonating clay (which is an earth style technique) was weak against lightning. Also, the part where Deidara feigned being under genjutsu, great fight.\n\n\nMany other fights like Gaara vs Deidara, where Deidara sacrificed an arm to put bombs in Gaara's sand, district him using C3 so he can force him to cover himself with the sand he previously infused bomb inside. Konan setting up the trap of million paper bomb.\n\nNaruto and Sasuke vs Kaguya: Using clones (Sasuke was hiding behind two) to bamboozle Kaguya to get into a position to seal her. Reverse Sexy Jutsu, enough said. Tricking Kaguya by attacking truth seeker balls to a fake clone she thinks that clone is the real Naruto.\n\nEven Might Guy vs Madara, Strategy used by Minato, Lee and Gaara, using teamwork to their advantage.\n\nI don't remember OG Naruto having this much strategy at all.",

Just because he wrote their abilities really well doesnt means that he didnt make the mistake of focusing too much on them in Shippuden. Shippuden should have focused more on the Jinchurikis rather than making everything about Uchihas. I honestly loved Shippuden and the direction in which it was going till the Pain Arc but I didnt liked the story that much after it. Also, by giving a bit less importance to the Uchihas ( especially Sasuke ), Kishimoto could have written Naruto's character a lot better too as can be seen from the Pain Arc and war Arc when Naruto as a character was at his best imo.",

Going with the Jinchuriki (as I have read all fanfictions I could find regarding it) would always be redundant when there is more than 2 or 3. Also for Naruto's character, I don't see why one would find him badly written. Naruto's character arc works very well with the duality he presented with Sasuke's character arc and colliding them at the end in the final valley fight. I would suggest you to watch these two video if you haven't already. He explains more than what I could ever interptet.\n\n  https://youtu.be/g0BtpRusxWU\n\nAnd about how Sharingan and Mangekyou contribute to the large scale of things in Narutoberse with the theme it encompasses: \n\nhttps://youtu.be/JmUgmWzWiRU",

Maybe it wasn\u2019t actually sleeping that was the problem, but rather it was the belief Shukaku needed to instil into Gaara to be able to temporarily release himself.

Not prevent harm, but at least stop you dying. And then I would have been cool with Uchiha\u2019s just being more evasive and skillful than they already are so that they didn\u2019t take damage as frequently in fights, but when they did - it was a problem. \n\nI mean, I get Sasuke has always been fast, but why is he as fast as Naruto?  I wish they would atleast explain it by saying it\u2019s caused by some form of lightning release or something. He doesn\u2019t have the same destructive output, but his physical strength is pretty much the same - but Naruto needs Sage mode to truly express his strength too. \n\nThe fact that spamming the Mangekyo sharingan caused ninja aids and reduced your vision was a good balance. It at least made sense that they was trading life-force and their ability that made them OP in the first place for all of that extra strength and the hacks abilities. But then EMS just made any Uchiha ridiculously OP. \n\nIdk, Naruto is still stronger, but he needs half of the strongest Biju by far, and sage mode - and Sasuke is still literally only one step behind him. \n\nAlthough, you could argue that before Sasuke recieved the Rinnegan from Hagoromo, Naruto was on a different level to Sasuke, as evident by his frustration in witnessing Naruto\u2019s growth when Sasuke joined the war.",

Space Chakra God? Really? That's the worst grand reveal I've ever seen.\n\n\nToo see everything wrong with Shippuden, think about the difference between Minato, who was a WAR HERO AND HOKAGE.

It had more strategy, and actual strategy, not \"Haha fake clone\" nonsense, it reduced the usage of literal plot holes OP techniques like Substitution Jutsu or transformation Jutsu which the first part is filled with. Original Naruto is nothing but BS forced strategy over and over again, a guy like Iruka can be alright after taking a giant Shuriken in his back but a mercenary like Zabuza HAS to dodge a fucking Kunai thrown at him by a kid (If he could've hold on to his water bubble for longer, Kakashi was dead but plot), or how about just like how he jumped to dodge it the first time, this time get down to dodge it? The Chunnin Exams are filled with trash fight left and right, Naruto vs Kiba, Ino vs Sakura, Rock Lee vs Gaara is nothing but power creep DBZ melodrama of punches and kicks, no actual strategy. Neji vs Naruto sucked, the only good moment was Naruto's uppercut moment, Gaara vs Sasuke was terrible with big neck Sasuke needed an entire fucking episode to charge ONE chidori, no strategy in that fight either. Talking about forced strategy, Shika vs Temari is the perfect example of it, she could've easily spammed her fan throughout the fight but only uses it ONCE and never again, who fights like this? It's not like she has a finisher cool down to wait for. \n\nI don't get how Tailed beasts (which were expanded upon again, if they have two in OG, why can't they have more?) or Chakra natures, are such big problems(which like you said was only for an arc, nothing major), if things which are getting expanded upon from OG Naruto's lore are \"show horned\" for you, then would you call pulling out a DBZ butterfly pill out of thin air at the very convenient moment which didn't even had any lore to begin with?\n\nAnd I didn't said Shippuden was flawless, as terrible as Kaguya reveal was, at the very least the show had actual good moments, high highs like Itachi vs Sasuke, Pain arc, or The tale of Jiraya the Gallant which is enough to put the entire OG to shame which barely has anything memorable at all or enjoyable.",

Oh Naruto had AT least SOME traps and tricks that made sense. \n\nFine then do mention how OG Naruto is more strategic. Here's what I can remember from Shippuden.\n\n\nSasuke tricking Danzo into believing he had one more eye open at 5 Kage Summit\n\nMinato cleverly outspeeding Obito\n\nNaruto having to deduct how to hurt 3rd Raikage with very little info and make him stab himself\n\nDarui had to deduct how the sealing weapons that the gold and silver brothers had worked and outsmart them (the fight was lame but it was still based on strategy than bigger Jutsu)\n\nGaara using real like chemistry and temperature properties to beat Mizukage's exploding steam clone\n\nThe entire first half of the fight against masked Obito and Naruto/Guy/Bee/Kakashi having to deduce how Kamui worked and how they could exploit it's weakness.\n\nKakashi pinning Obito's hand with Kunai saving him from Lava dimension\n\nNaruto sending his nature energy to One of Pain's causing him to turn into a rock\n\nNaruto using his shadow clones to close of the distance with Pain and also withstanding the force of Pain's almighty push and cancelling it out by having his Clones stand behind him. Naruto leaving clones to gather more Nature energy, Storing and using nature chakra requires a person to sit still and meditate to draw it in. This makes it difficult to use in battle, but Naruto used his proficiency with shadow clones as a work around. While he went off to battle Pain, he left behind a couple of clones who were constantly meditating and\u00a0storing Sage Chakra. When Naruto's sage mode ran out of time, he would recall one of the clones and all of the nature chakra would flow into his original body.\n\nShikamaru's entire fight is just him heavenly relying on strategy against Hidan.\n\nSasuke vs Itachi was all tricking each other by substitution, using Ninja tools, Sasuke using his fireball to increase the temperature of the atmosphere making thunderclouds to use as Less chakra as possible to create Kirin.\n\nObito vs Kakashi.\n\nJiraiya vs 6 Paths of Pain was completely based on stealth.\n\nSasuke using a massive fireball Jutsu keeping Naruto busy while handling the Giant ball while he switches places with one of The truth seeking balls, Sasuke using Amaterasu which gets countered by Naruto covering his body with Kurama's Chakra and disowning that Chakra, Naruto leaving his clones to gather Nature energy. \n\nSasori vs Sakura is another underrated fight tbh in terms of how well thought out and unique it was with brilliantly matching with Chiyo's puppet powers and Sakura's strength, countering Sasori's position with Antidote she created. \n\nSasuke deactivated the land mines by channeling lightning through his katana, Deidara thought it coincidence but Sasuke had been making observations that his detonating clay (which is an earth style technique) was weak against lightning. Also, the part where Deidara feigned being under genjutsu, great fight.\n\n\nMany other fights like Gaara vs Deidara, where Deidara sacrificed an arm to put bombs in Gaara's sand, district him using C3 so he can force him to cover himself with the sand he previously infused bomb inside. Konan setting up the trap of million paper bomb.\n\nNaruto and Sasuke vs Kaguya: Using clones (Sasuke was hiding behind two) to bamboozle Kaguya to get into a position to seal her. Reverse Sexy Jutsu, enough said. Tricking Kaguya by attacking truth seeker balls to a fake clone she thinks that clone is the real Naruto.\n\nEven Might Guy vs Madara, Strategy used by Minato, Lee and Gaara, using teamwork to their advantage.\n\nI don't remember OG Naruto having this much strategy at all.",

Also for Naruto's character, I don't see why one would find him badly written. Naruto's character arc works very well with the duality he presented with Sasuke's character arc and colliding them at the end in the final valley fight. I would suggest you to watch these two video if you haven't already. He explains more than what I could ever interptet.\n\n  https://youtu.be/g0BtpRusxWU\n\nAnd about how Sharingan and Mangekyou contribute to the large scale of things in Narutoberse with the theme it encompasses: \n\nhttps://youtu.be/JmUgmWzWiRU",

Makes no sense why Gaara was able to go to sleep and be a happier kid after his encounter with Naruto. \n\nMaybe it was just Shukaku tormenting Gaara and scaring him that allowed him to exploit his emotions and go on those rampages. Maybe it wasn\u2019t actually sleeping that was the problem, but rather it was the belief Shukaku needed to instil into Gaara to be able to temporarily release himself.

They need both eyes awakened to use Susanoo but they also have to be descended from Indra unless they get possessed by an Uchiha. If someone loses their eyes like Madara then they can still use it. MS are like the keys that unlock it.\n\nPerhaps by doing Orochimaru like experiments with cells of people who awakened MS could be used to give someone else that Susanoo though.",

Not prevent harm, but at least stop you dying. And then I would have been cool with Uchiha\u2019s just being more evasive and skillful than they already are so that they didn\u2019t take damage as frequently in fights, but when they did - it was a problem. \n\nI mean, I get Sasuke has always been fast, but why is he as fast as Naruto?  I wish they would atleast explain it by saying it\u2019s caused by some form of lightning release or something. He doesn\u2019t have the same destructive output, but his physical strength is pretty much the same - but Naruto needs Sage mode to truly express his strength too. \n\nThe fact that spamming the Mangekyo sharingan caused ninja aids and reduced your vision was a good balance. It at least made sense that they was trading life-force and their ability that made them OP in the first place for all of that extra strength and the hacks abilities. But then EMS just made any Uchiha ridiculously OP. \n\nIdk, Naruto is still stronger, but he needs half of the strongest Biju by far, and sage mode - and Sasuke is still literally only one step behind him. \n\nAlthough, you could argue that before Sasuke recieved the Rinnegan from Hagoromo, Naruto was on a different level to Sasuke, as evident by his frustration in witnessing Naruto\u2019s growth when Sasuke joined the war.",

Nothing Naruto did mattered because he'd just one up it in the next arc (remember sage mode?), and the whole series was basically retconned.\n\nThinks like the tailed beasts and Chakra nature's were show horned in, with the latter mattering literally for one training arc.\n\nAnd I really shouldn't have to point out how ridiculous the ending was. Space Chakra God? Really? That's the worst grand reveal I've ever seen.\n\n\nToo see everything wrong with Shippuden, think about the difference between Minato, who was a WAR HERO AND HOKAGE. His entire kit was teleporting around.\n\nNaruto? He sets off a nuclear bomb, can transform into mutiple forms, create an army of himself, and to boot he's the reincarnation of a seemingly important character that was introduced in the last arcs CONCLUSION.",

It had more strategy, and actual strategy, not \"Haha fake clone\" nonsense, it reduced the usage of literal plot holes OP techniques like Substitution Jutsu or transformation Jutsu which the first part is filled with. Original Naruto is nothing but BS forced strategy over and over again, a guy like Iruka can be alright after taking a giant Shuriken in his back but a mercenary like Zabuza HAS to dodge a fucking Kunai thrown at him by a kid (If he could've hold on to his water bubble for longer, Kakashi was dead but plot), or how about just like how he jumped to dodge it the first time, this time get down to dodge it? The Chunnin Exams are filled with trash fight left and right, Naruto vs Kiba, Ino vs Sakura, Rock Lee vs Gaara is nothing but power creep DBZ melodrama of punches and kicks, no actual strategy. Neji vs Naruto sucked, the only good moment was Naruto's uppercut moment, Gaara vs Sasuke was terrible with big neck Sasuke needed an entire fucking episode to charge ONE chidori, no strategy in that fight either. Talking about forced strategy, Shika vs Temari is the perfect example of it, she could've easily spammed her fan throughout the fight but only uses it ONCE and never again, who fights like this? It's not like she has a finisher cool down to wait for. \n\nI don't get how Tailed beasts (which were expanded upon again, if they have two in OG, why can't they have more?) or Chakra natures, are such big problems(which like you said was only for an arc, nothing major), if things which are getting expanded upon from OG Naruto's lore are \"show horned\" for you, then would you call pulling out a DBZ butterfly pill out of thin air at the very convenient moment which didn't even had any lore to begin with?\n\nAnd I didn't said Shippuden was flawless, as terrible as Kaguya reveal was, at the very least the show had actual good moments, high highs like Itachi vs Sasuke, Pain arc, or The tale of Jiraya the Gallant which is enough to put the entire OG to shame which barely has anything memorable at all or enjoyable.",

Oh Naruto had AT least SOME traps and tricks that made sense. \n\nFine then do mention how OG Naruto is more strategic. Here's what I can remember from Shippuden.\n\n\nSasuke tricking Danzo into believing he had one more eye open at 5 Kage Summit\n\nMinato cleverly outspeeding Obito\n\nNaruto having to deduct how to hurt 3rd Raikage with very little info and make him stab himself\n\nDarui had to deduct how the sealing weapons that the gold and silver brothers had worked and outsmart them (the fight was lame but it was still based on strategy than bigger Jutsu)\n\nGaara using real like chemistry and temperature properties to beat Mizukage's exploding steam clone\n\nThe entire first half of the fight against masked Obito and Naruto/Guy/Bee/Kakashi having to deduce how Kamui worked and how they could exploit it's weakness.\n\nKakashi pinning Obito's hand with Kunai saving him from Lava dimension\n\nNaruto sending his nature energy to One of Pain's causing him to turn into a rock\n\nNaruto using his shadow clones to close of the distance with Pain and also withstanding the force of Pain's almighty push and cancelling it out by having his Clones stand behind him. Naruto leaving clones to gather more Nature energy, Storing and using nature chakra requires a person to sit still and meditate to draw it in. This makes it difficult to use in battle, but Naruto used his proficiency with shadow clones as a work around. While he went off to battle Pain, he left behind a couple of clones who were constantly meditating and\u00a0storing Sage Chakra. When Naruto's sage mode ran out of time, he would recall one of the clones and all of the nature chakra would flow into his original body.\n\nShikamaru's entire fight is just him heavenly relying on strategy against Hidan.\n\nSasuke vs Itachi was all tricking each other by substitution, using Ninja tools, Sasuke using his fireball to increase the temperature of the atmosphere making thunderclouds to use as Less chakra as possible to create Kirin.\n\nObito vs Kakashi.\n\nJiraiya vs 6 Paths of Pain was completely based on stealth.\n\nSasuke using a massive fireball Jutsu keeping Naruto busy while handling the Giant ball while he switches places with one of The truth seeking balls, Sasuke using Amaterasu which gets countered by Naruto covering his body with Kurama's Chakra and disowning that Chakra, Naruto leaving his clones to gather Nature energy. \n\nSasori vs Sakura is another underrated fight tbh in terms of how well thought out and unique it was with brilliantly matching with Chiyo's puppet powers and Sakura's strength, countering Sasori's position with Antidote she created. \n\nSasuke deactivated the land mines by channeling lightning through his katana, Deidara thought it coincidence but Sasuke had been making observations that his detonating clay (which is an earth style technique) was weak against lightning. Also, the part where Deidara feigned being under genjutsu, great fight.\n\n\nMany other fights like Gaara vs Deidara, where Deidara sacrificed an arm to put bombs in Gaara's sand, district him using C3 so he can force him to cover himself with the sand he previously infused bomb inside. Konan setting up the trap of million paper bomb.\n\nNaruto and Sasuke vs Kaguya: Using clones (Sasuke was hiding behind two) to bamboozle Kaguya to get into a position to seal her. Reverse Sexy Jutsu, enough said. Tricking Kaguya by attacking truth seeker balls to a fake clone she thinks that clone is the real Naruto.\n\nEven Might Guy vs Madara, Strategy used by Minato, Lee and Gaara, using teamwork to their advantage.\n\nI don't remember OG Naruto having this much strategy at all.",

The Uzumaki clan had the most renowned sealing jutsus in the Naruto-verse and Naruto\u2019s sealing jutsu was one that even needed 2 human sacrifices. Gaara\u2019s sealing jutsu could have been a lot less advanced. \n\nBut I get what you mean. Makes no sense why Gaara was able to go to sleep and be a happier kid after his encounter with Naruto. \n\nMaybe it was just Shukaku tormenting Gaara and scaring him that allowed him to exploit his emotions and go on those rampages. Maybe it wasn\u2019t actually sleeping that was the problem, but rather it was the belief Shukaku needed to instil into Gaara to be able to temporarily release himself. Either way, it should have been cleared up.",

Not prevent harm, but at least stop you dying. And then I would have been cool with Uchiha\u2019s just being more evasive and skillful than they already are so that they didn\u2019t take damage as frequently in fights, but when they did - it was a problem. \n\nI mean, I get Sasuke has always been fast, but why is he as fast as Naruto?  I wish they would atleast explain it by saying it\u2019s caused by some form of lightning release or something. He doesn\u2019t have the same destructive output, but his physical strength is pretty much the same - but Naruto needs Sage mode to truly express his strength too. \n\nThe fact that spamming the Mangekyo sharingan caused ninja aids and reduced your vision was a good balance. It at least made sense that they was trading life-force and their ability that made them OP in the first place for all of that extra strength and the hacks abilities. But then EMS just made any Uchiha ridiculously OP. \n\nIdk, Naruto is still stronger, but he needs half of the strongest Biju by far, and sage mode - and Sasuke is still literally only one step behind him. \n\nAlthough, you could argue that before Sasuke recieved the Rinnegan from Hagoromo, Naruto was on a different level to Sasuke, as evident by his frustration in witnessing Naruto\u2019s growth when Sasuke joined the war.",

Power creep EXPLOADED. Nothing Naruto did mattered because he'd just one up it in the next arc (remember sage mode?), and the whole series was basically retconned.\n\nThinks like the tailed beasts and Chakra nature's were show horned in, with the latter mattering literally for one training arc.\n\nAnd I really shouldn't have to point out how ridiculous the ending was. Space Chakra God? Really? That's the worst grand reveal I've ever seen.\n\n\nToo see everything wrong with Shippuden, think about the difference between Minato, who was a WAR HERO AND HOKAGE. His entire kit was teleporting around.\n\nNaruto? He sets off a nuclear bomb, can transform into mutiple forms, create an army of himself, and to boot he's the reincarnation of a seemingly important character that was introduced in the last arcs CONCLUSION.",

It had more strategy, and actual strategy, not \"Haha fake clone\" nonsense, it reduced the usage of literal plot holes OP techniques like Substitution Jutsu or transformation Jutsu which the first part is filled with. Original Naruto is nothing but BS forced strategy over and over again, a guy like Iruka can be alright after taking a giant Shuriken in his back but a mercenary like Zabuza HAS to dodge a fucking Kunai thrown at him by a kid (If he could've hold on to his water bubble for longer, Kakashi was dead but plot), or how about just like how he jumped to dodge it the first time, this time get down to dodge it? The Chunnin Exams are filled with trash fight left and right, Naruto vs Kiba, Ino vs Sakura, Rock Lee vs Gaara is nothing but power creep DBZ melodrama of punches and kicks, no actual strategy. Neji vs Naruto sucked, the only good moment was Naruto's uppercut moment, Gaara vs Sasuke was terrible with big neck Sasuke needed an entire fucking episode to charge ONE chidori, no strategy in that fight either. Talking about forced strategy, Shika vs Temari is the perfect example of it, she could've easily spammed her fan throughout the fight but only uses it ONCE and never again, who fights like this? It's not like she has a finisher cool down to wait for. \n\nI don't get how Tailed beasts (which were expanded upon again, if they have two in OG, why can't they have more?) or Chakra natures, are such big problems(which like you said was only for an arc, nothing major), if things which are getting expanded upon from OG Naruto's lore are \"show horned\" for you, then would you call pulling out a DBZ butterfly pill out of thin air at the very convenient moment which didn't even had any lore to begin with?\n\nAnd I didn't said Shippuden was flawless, as terrible as Kaguya reveal was, at the very least the show had actual good moments, high highs like Itachi vs Sasuke, Pain arc, or The tale of Jiraya the Gallant which is enough to put the entire OG to shame which barely has anything memorable at all or enjoyable.",

Oh Naruto had AT least SOME traps and tricks that made sense. \n\nFine then do mention how OG Naruto is more strategic. Here's what I can remember from Shippuden.\n\n\nSasuke tricking Danzo into believing he had one more eye open at 5 Kage Summit\n\nMinato cleverly outspeeding Obito\n\nNaruto having to deduct how to hurt 3rd Raikage with very little info and make him stab himself\n\nDarui had to deduct how the sealing weapons that the gold and silver brothers had worked and outsmart them (the fight was lame but it was still based on strategy than bigger Jutsu)\n\nGaara using real like chemistry and temperature properties to beat Mizukage's exploding steam clone\n\nThe entire first half of the fight against masked Obito and Naruto/Guy/Bee/Kakashi having to deduce how Kamui worked and how they could exploit it's weakness.\n\nKakashi pinning Obito's hand with Kunai saving him from Lava dimension\n\nNaruto sending his nature energy to One of Pain's causing him to turn into a rock\n\nNaruto using his shadow clones to close of the distance with Pain and also withstanding the force of Pain's almighty push and cancelling it out by having his Clones stand behind him. Naruto leaving clones to gather more Nature energy, Storing and using nature chakra requires a person to sit still and meditate to draw it in. This makes it difficult to use in battle, but Naruto used his proficiency with shadow clones as a work around. While he went off to battle Pain, he left behind a couple of clones who were constantly meditating and\u00a0storing Sage Chakra. When Naruto's sage mode ran out of time, he would recall one of the clones and all of the nature chakra would flow into his original body.\n\nShikamaru's entire fight is just him heavenly relying on strategy against Hidan.\n\nSasuke vs Itachi was all tricking each other by substitution, using Ninja tools, Sasuke using his fireball to increase the temperature of the atmosphere making thunderclouds to use as Less chakra as possible to create Kirin.\n\nObito vs Kakashi.\n\nJiraiya vs 6 Paths of Pain was completely based on stealth.\n\nSasuke using a massive fireball Jutsu keeping Naruto busy while handling the Giant ball while he switches places with one of The truth seeking balls, Sasuke using Amaterasu which gets countered by Naruto covering his body with Kurama's Chakra and disowning that Chakra, Naruto leaving his clones to gather Nature energy. \n\nSasori vs Sakura is another underrated fight tbh in terms of how well thought out and unique it was with brilliantly matching with Chiyo's puppet powers and Sakura's strength, countering Sasori's position with Antidote she created. \n\nSasuke deactivated the land mines by channeling lightning through his katana, Deidara thought it coincidence but Sasuke had been making observations that his detonating clay (which is an earth style technique) was weak against lightning. Also, the part where Deidara feigned being under genjutsu, great fight.\n\n\nMany other fights like Gaara vs Deidara, where Deidara sacrificed an arm to put bombs in Gaara's sand, district him using C3 so he can force him to cover himself with the sand he previously infused bomb inside. Konan setting up the trap of million paper bomb.\n\nNaruto and Sasuke vs Kaguya: Using clones (Sasuke was hiding behind two) to bamboozle Kaguya to get into a position to seal her. Reverse Sexy Jutsu, enough said. Tricking Kaguya by attacking truth seeker balls to a fake clone she thinks that clone is the real Naruto.\n\nEven Might Guy vs Madara, Strategy used by Minato, Lee and Gaara, using teamwork to their advantage.\n\nI don't remember OG Naruto having this much strategy at all.",

Space Chakra God? Really? That's the worst grand reveal I've ever seen.\n\n\nToo see everything wrong with Shippuden, think about the difference between Minato, who was a WAR HERO AND HOKAGE. His entire kit was teleporting around.\n\nNaruto? He sets off a nuclear bomb, can transform into mutiple forms, create an army of himself, and to boot he's the reincarnation of a seemingly important character that was introduced in the last arcs CONCLUSION.",

It had more strategy, and actual strategy, not \"Haha fake clone\" nonsense, it reduced the usage of literal plot holes OP techniques like Substitution Jutsu or transformation Jutsu which the first part is filled with. Original Naruto is nothing but BS forced strategy over and over again, a guy like Iruka can be alright after taking a giant Shuriken in his back but a mercenary like Zabuza HAS to dodge a fucking Kunai thrown at him by a kid (If he could've hold on to his water bubble for longer, Kakashi was dead but plot), or how about just like how he jumped to dodge it the first time, this time get down to dodge it? The Chunnin Exams are filled with trash fight left and right, Naruto vs Kiba, Ino vs Sakura, Rock Lee vs Gaara is nothing but power creep DBZ melodrama of punches and kicks, no actual strategy. Neji vs Naruto sucked, the only good moment was Naruto's uppercut moment, Gaara vs Sasuke was terrible with big neck Sasuke needed an entire fucking episode to charge ONE chidori, no strategy in that fight either. Talking about forced strategy, Shika vs Temari is the perfect example of it, she could've easily spammed her fan throughout the fight but only uses it ONCE and never again, who fights like this? It's not like she has a finisher cool down to wait for. \n\nI don't get how Tailed beasts (which were expanded upon again, if they have two in OG, why can't they have more?) or Chakra natures, are such big problems(which like you said was only for an arc, nothing major), if things which are getting expanded upon from OG Naruto's lore are \"show horned\" for you, then would you call pulling out a DBZ butterfly pill out of thin air at the very convenient moment which didn't even had any lore to begin with?\n\nAnd I didn't said Shippuden was flawless, as terrible as Kaguya reveal was, at the very least the show had actual good moments, high highs like Itachi vs Sasuke, Pain arc, or The tale of Jiraya the Gallant which is enough to put the entire OG to shame which barely has anything memorable at all or enjoyable.",

Oh Naruto had AT least SOME traps and tricks that made sense. \n\nFine then do mention how OG Naruto is more strategic. Here's what I can remember from Shippuden.\n\n\nSasuke tricking Danzo into believing he had one more eye open at 5 Kage Summit\n\nMinato cleverly outspeeding Obito\n\nNaruto having to deduct how to hurt 3rd Raikage with very little info and make him stab himself\n\nDarui had to deduct how the sealing weapons that the gold and silver brothers had worked and outsmart them (the fight was lame but it was still based on strategy than bigger Jutsu)\n\nGaara using real like chemistry and temperature properties to beat Mizukage's exploding steam clone\n\nThe entire first half of the fight against masked Obito and Naruto/Guy/Bee/Kakashi having to deduce how Kamui worked and how they could exploit it's weakness.\n\nKakashi pinning Obito's hand with Kunai saving him from Lava dimension\n\nNaruto sending his nature energy to One of Pain's causing him to turn into a rock\n\nNaruto using his shadow clones to close of the distance with Pain and also withstanding the force of Pain's almighty push and cancelling it out by having his Clones stand behind him. Naruto leaving clones to gather more Nature energy, Storing and using nature chakra requires a person to sit still and meditate to draw it in. This makes it difficult to use in battle, but Naruto used his proficiency with shadow clones as a work around. While he went off to battle Pain, he left behind a couple of clones who were constantly meditating and\u00a0storing Sage Chakra. When Naruto's sage mode ran out of time, he would recall one of the clones and all of the nature chakra would flow into his original body.\n\nShikamaru's entire fight is just him heavenly relying on strategy against Hidan.\n\nSasuke vs Itachi was all tricking each other by substitution, using Ninja tools, Sasuke using his fireball to increase the temperature of the atmosphere making thunderclouds to use as Less chakra as possible to create Kirin.\n\nObito vs Kakashi.\n\nJiraiya vs 6 Paths of Pain was completely based on stealth.\n\nSasuke using a massive fireball Jutsu keeping Naruto busy while handling the Giant ball while he switches places with one of The truth seeking balls, Sasuke using Amaterasu which gets countered by Naruto covering his body with Kurama's Chakra and disowning that Chakra, Naruto leaving his clones to gather Nature energy. \n\nSasori vs Sakura is another underrated fight tbh in terms of how well thought out and unique it was with brilliantly matching with Chiyo's puppet powers and Sakura's strength, countering Sasori's position with Antidote she created. \n\nSasuke deactivated the land mines by channeling lightning through his katana, Deidara thought it coincidence but Sasuke had been making observations that his detonating clay (which is an earth style technique) was weak against lightning. Also, the part where Deidara feigned being under genjutsu, great fight.\n\n\nMany other fights like Gaara vs Deidara, where Deidara sacrificed an arm to put bombs in Gaara's sand, district him using C3 so he can force him to cover himself with the sand he previously infused bomb inside. Konan setting up the trap of million paper bomb.\n\nNaruto and Sasuke vs Kaguya: Using clones (Sasuke was hiding behind two) to bamboozle Kaguya to get into a position to seal her. Reverse Sexy Jutsu, enough said. Tricking Kaguya by attacking truth seeker balls to a fake clone she thinks that clone is the real Naruto.\n\nEven Might Guy vs Madara, Strategy used by Minato, Lee and Gaara, using teamwork to their advantage.\n\nI don't remember OG Naruto having this much strategy at all.",

Nothing Naruto did mattered because he'd just one up it in the next arc (remember sage mode?), and the whole series was basically retconned.\n\nThinks like the tailed beasts and Chakra nature's were show horned in, with the latter mattering literally for one training arc.\n\nAnd I really shouldn't have to point out how ridiculous the ending was. Space Chakra God? Really? That's the worst grand reveal I've ever seen.\n\n\nToo see everything wrong with Shippuden, think about the difference between Minato, who was a WAR HERO AND HOKAGE. His entire kit was teleporting around.\n\nNaruto? He sets off a nuclear bomb, can transform into mutiple forms, create an army of himself, and to boot he's the reincarnation of a seemingly important character that was introduced in the last arcs CONCLUSION.",

It had more strategy, and actual strategy, not \"Haha fake clone\" nonsense, it reduced the usage of literal plot holes OP techniques like Substitution Jutsu or transformation Jutsu which the first part is filled with. Original Naruto is nothing but BS forced strategy over and over again, a guy like Iruka can be alright after taking a giant Shuriken in his back but a mercenary like Zabuza HAS to dodge a fucking Kunai thrown at him by a kid (If he could've hold on to his water bubble for longer, Kakashi was dead but plot), or how about just like how he jumped to dodge it the first time, this time get down to dodge it? The Chunnin Exams are filled with trash fight left and right, Naruto vs Kiba, Ino vs Sakura, Rock Lee vs Gaara is nothing but power creep DBZ melodrama of punches and kicks, no actual strategy. Neji vs Naruto sucked, the only good moment was Naruto's uppercut moment, Gaara vs Sasuke was terrible with big neck Sasuke needed an entire fucking episode to charge ONE chidori, no strategy in that fight either. Talking about forced strategy, Shika vs Temari is the perfect example of it, she could've easily spammed her fan throughout the fight but only uses it ONCE and never again, who fights like this? It's not like she has a finisher cool down to wait for. \n\nI don't get how Tailed beasts (which were expanded upon again, if they have two in OG, why can't they have more?) or Chakra natures, are such big problems(which like you said was only for an arc, nothing major), if things which are getting expanded upon from OG Naruto's lore are \"show horned\" for you, then would you call pulling out a DBZ butterfly pill out of thin air at the very convenient moment which didn't even had any lore to begin with?\n\nAnd I didn't said Shippuden was flawless, as terrible as Kaguya reveal was, at the very least the show had actual good moments, high highs like Itachi vs Sasuke, Pain arc, or The tale of Jiraya the Gallant which is enough to put the entire OG to shame which barely has anything memorable at all or enjoyable.",

Oh Naruto had AT least SOME traps and tricks that made sense. \n\nFine then do mention how OG Naruto is more strategic. Here's what I can remember from Shippuden.\n\n\nSasuke tricking Danzo into believing he had one more eye open at 5 Kage Summit\n\nMinato cleverly outspeeding Obito\n\nNaruto having to deduct how to hurt 3rd Raikage with very little info and make him stab himself\n\nDarui had to deduct how the sealing weapons that the gold and silver brothers had worked and outsmart them (the fight was lame but it was still based on strategy than bigger Jutsu)\n\nGaara using real like chemistry and temperature properties to beat Mizukage's exploding steam clone\n\nThe entire first half of the fight against masked Obito and Naruto/Guy/Bee/Kakashi having to deduce how Kamui worked and how they could exploit it's weakness.\n\nKakashi pinning Obito's hand with Kunai saving him from Lava dimension\n\nNaruto sending his nature energy to One of Pain's causing him to turn into a rock\n\nNaruto using his shadow clones to close of the distance with Pain and also withstanding the force of Pain's almighty push and cancelling it out by having his Clones stand behind him. Naruto leaving clones to gather more Nature energy, Storing and using nature chakra requires a person to sit still and meditate to draw it in. This makes it difficult to use in battle, but Naruto used his proficiency with shadow clones as a work around. While he went off to battle Pain, he left behind a couple of clones who were constantly meditating and\u00a0storing Sage Chakra. When Naruto's sage mode ran out of time, he would recall one of the clones and all of the nature chakra would flow into his original body.\n\nShikamaru's entire fight is just him heavenly relying on strategy against Hidan.\n\nSasuke vs Itachi was all tricking each other by substitution, using Ninja tools, Sasuke using his fireball to increase the temperature of the atmosphere making thunderclouds to use as Less chakra as possible to create Kirin.\n\nObito vs Kakashi.\n\nJiraiya vs 6 Paths of Pain was completely based on stealth.\n\nSasuke using a massive fireball Jutsu keeping Naruto busy while handling the Giant ball while he switches places with one of The truth seeking balls, Sasuke using Amaterasu which gets countered by Naruto covering his body with Kurama's Chakra and disowning that Chakra, Naruto leaving his clones to gather Nature energy. \n\nSasori vs Sakura is another underrated fight tbh in terms of how well thought out and unique it was with brilliantly matching with Chiyo's puppet powers and Sakura's strength, countering Sasori's position with Antidote she created. \n\nSasuke deactivated the land mines by channeling lightning through his katana, Deidara thought it coincidence but Sasuke had been making observations that his detonating clay (which is an earth style technique) was weak against lightning. Also, the part where Deidara feigned being under genjutsu, great fight.\n\n\nMany other fights like Gaara vs Deidara, where Deidara sacrificed an arm to put bombs in Gaara's sand, district him using C3 so he can force him to cover himself with the sand he previously infused bomb inside. Konan setting up the trap of million paper bomb.\n\nNaruto and Sasuke vs Kaguya: Using clones (Sasuke was hiding behind two) to bamboozle Kaguya to get into a position to seal her. Reverse Sexy Jutsu, enough said. Tricking Kaguya by attacking truth seeker balls to a fake clone she thinks that clone is the real Naruto.\n\nEven Might Guy vs Madara, Strategy used by Minato, Lee and Gaara, using teamwork to their advantage.\n\nI don't remember OG Naruto having this much strategy at all.",

It had more strategy, and actual strategy, not \"Haha fake clone\" nonsense, it reduced the usage of literal plot holes OP techniques like Substitution Jutsu or transformation Jutsu which the first part is filled with. Original Naruto is nothing but BS forced strategy over and over again, a guy like Iruka can be alright after taking a giant Shuriken in his back but a mercenary like Zabuza HAS to dodge a fucking Kunai thrown at him by a kid (If he could've hold on to his water bubble for longer, Kakashi was dead but plot), or how about just like how he jumped to dodge it the first time, this time get down to dodge it? The Chunnin Exams are filled with trash fight left and right, Naruto vs Kiba, Ino vs Sakura, Rock Lee vs Gaara is nothing but power creep DBZ melodrama of punches and kicks, no actual strategy. Neji vs Naruto sucked, the only good moment was Naruto's uppercut moment, Gaara vs Sasuke was terrible with big neck Sasuke needed an entire fucking episode to charge ONE chidori, no strategy in that fight either. Talking about forced strategy, Shika vs Temari is the perfect example of it, she could've easily spammed her fan throughout the fight but only uses it ONCE and never again, who fights like this? It's not like she has a finisher cool down to wait for. \n\nI don't get how Tailed beasts (which were expanded upon again, if they have two in OG, why can't they have more?) or Chakra natures, are such big problems(which like you said was only for an arc, nothing major), if things which are getting expanded upon from OG Naruto's lore are \"show horned\" for you, then would you call pulling out a DBZ butterfly pill out of thin air at the very convenient moment which didn't even had any lore to begin with?\n\nAnd I didn't said Shippuden was flawless, as terrible as Kaguya reveal was, at the very least the show had actual good moments, high highs like Itachi vs Sasuke, Pain arc, or The tale of Jiraya the Gallant which is enough to put the entire OG to shame which barely has anything memorable at all or enjoyable.",

Oh Naruto had AT least SOME traps and tricks that made sense. \n\nFine then do mention how OG Naruto is more strategic. Here's what I can remember from Shippuden.\n\n\nSasuke tricking Danzo into believing he had one more eye open at 5 Kage Summit\n\nMinato cleverly outspeeding Obito\n\nNaruto having to deduct how to hurt 3rd Raikage with very little info and make him stab himself\n\nDarui had to deduct how the sealing weapons that the gold and silver brothers had worked and outsmart them (the fight was lame but it was still based on strategy than bigger Jutsu)\n\nGaara using real like chemistry and temperature properties to beat Mizukage's exploding steam clone\n\nThe entire first half of the fight against masked Obito and Naruto/Guy/Bee/Kakashi having to deduce how Kamui worked and how they could exploit it's weakness.\n\nKakashi pinning Obito's hand with Kunai saving him from Lava dimension\n\nNaruto sending his nature energy to One of Pain's causing him to turn into a rock\n\nNaruto using his shadow clones to close of the distance with Pain and also withstanding the force of Pain's almighty push and cancelling it out by having his Clones stand behind him. Naruto leaving clones to gather more Nature energy, Storing and using nature chakra requires a person to sit still and meditate to draw it in. This makes it difficult to use in battle, but Naruto used his proficiency with shadow clones as a work around. While he went off to battle Pain, he left behind a couple of clones who were constantly meditating and\u00a0storing Sage Chakra. When Naruto's sage mode ran out of time, he would recall one of the clones and all of the nature chakra would flow into his original body.\n\nShikamaru's entire fight is just him heavenly relying on strategy against Hidan.\n\nSasuke vs Itachi was all tricking each other by substitution, using Ninja tools, Sasuke using his fireball to increase the temperature of the atmosphere making thunderclouds to use as Less chakra as possible to create Kirin.\n\nObito vs Kakashi.\n\nJiraiya vs 6 Paths of Pain was completely based on stealth.\n\nSasuke using a massive fireball Jutsu keeping Naruto busy while handling the Giant ball while he switches places with one of The truth seeking balls, Sasuke using Amaterasu which gets countered by Naruto covering his body with Kurama's Chakra and disowning that Chakra, Naruto leaving his clones to gather Nature energy. \n\nSasori vs Sakura is another underrated fight tbh in terms of how well thought out and unique it was with brilliantly matching with Chiyo's puppet powers and Sakura's strength, countering Sasori's position with Antidote she created. \n\nSasuke deactivated the land mines by channeling lightning through his katana, Deidara thought it coincidence but Sasuke had been making observations that his detonating clay (which is an earth style technique) was weak against lightning. Also, the part where Deidara feigned being under genjutsu, great fight.\n\n\nMany other fights like Gaara vs Deidara, where Deidara sacrificed an arm to put bombs in Gaara's sand, district him using C3 so he can force him to cover himself with the sand he previously infused bomb inside. Konan setting up the trap of million paper bomb.\n\nNaruto and Sasuke vs Kaguya: Using clones (Sasuke was hiding behind two) to bamboozle Kaguya to get into a position to seal her. Reverse Sexy Jutsu, enough said. Tricking Kaguya by attacking truth seeker balls to a fake clone she thinks that clone is the real Naruto.\n\nEven Might Guy vs Madara, Strategy used by Minato, Lee and Gaara, using teamwork to their advantage.\n\nI don't remember OG Naruto having this much strategy at all.",

            "body": ">And Idk what you mean by real strategy, because half the encounters in shippuden are just straight up fights. Oh Naruto had AT least SOME traps and tricks that made sense. \n\nFine then do mention how OG Naruto is more strategic. Here's what I can remember from Shippuden.\n\n\nSasuke tricking Danzo into believing he had one more eye open at 5 Kage Summit\n\nMinato cleverly outspeeding Obito\n\nNaruto having to deduct how to hurt 3rd Raikage with very little info and make him stab himself\n\nDarui had to deduct how the sealing weapons that the gold and silver brothers had worked and outsmart them (the fight was lame but it was still based on strategy than bigger Jutsu)\n\nGaara using real like chemistry and temperature properties to beat Mizukage's exploding steam clone\n\nThe entire first half of the fight against masked Obito and Naruto/Guy/Bee/Kakashi having to deduce how Kamui worked and how they could exploit it's weakness.\n\nKakashi pinning Obito's hand with Kunai saving him from Lava dimension\n\nNaruto sending his nature energy to One of Pain's causing him to turn into a rock\n\nNaruto using his shadow clones to close of the distance with Pain and also withstanding the force of Pain's almighty push and cancelling it out by having his Clones stand behind him. Naruto leaving clones to gather more Nature energy, Storing and using nature chakra requires a person to sit still and meditate to draw it in. This makes it difficult to use in battle, but Naruto used his proficiency with shadow clones as a work around. While he went off to battle Pain, he left behind a couple of clones who were constantly meditating and\u00a0storing Sage Chakra. When Naruto's sage mode ran out of time, he would recall one of the clones and all of the nature chakra would flow into his original body.\n\nShikamaru's entire fight is just him heavenly relying on strategy against Hidan.\n\nSasuke vs Itachi was all tricking each other by substitution, using Ninja tools, Sasuke using his fireball to increase the temperature of the atmosphere making thunderclouds to use as Less chakra as possible to create Kirin.\n\nObito vs Kakashi.\n\nJiraiya vs 6 Paths of Pain was completely based on stealth.\n\nSasuke using a massive fireball Jutsu keeping Naruto busy while handling the Giant ball while he switches places with one of The truth seeking balls, Sasuke using Amaterasu which gets countered by Naruto covering his body with Kurama's Chakra and disowning that Chakra, Naruto leaving his clones to gather Nature energy. \n\nSasori vs Sakura is another underrated fight tbh in terms of how well thought out and unique it was with brilliantly matching with Chiyo's puppet powers and Sakura's strength, countering Sasori's position with Antidote she created. \n\nSasuke deactivated the land mines by channeling lightning through his katana, Deidara thought it coincidence but Sasuke had been making observations that his detonating clay (which is an earth style technique) was weak against lightning. Also, the part where Deidara feigned being under genjutsu, great fight.\n\n\nMany other fights like Gaara vs Deidara, where Deidara sacrificed an arm to put bombs in Gaara's sand, district him using C3 so he can force him to cover himself with the sand he previously infused bomb inside. Konan setting up the trap of million paper bomb.\n\nNaruto and Sasuke vs Kaguya: Using clones (Sasuke was hiding behind two) to bamboozle Kaguya to get into a position to seal her. Reverse Sexy Jutsu, enough said. Tricking Kaguya by attacking truth seeker balls to a fake clone she thinks that clone is the real Naruto.\n\nEven Might Guy vs Madara, Strategy used by Minato, Lee and Gaara, using teamwork to their advantage.\n\nI don't remember OG Naruto having this much strategy at all.",
