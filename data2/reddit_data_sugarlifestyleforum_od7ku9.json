In escorting that would be called rates and in sugaring it would be called PPM, or eventually allowance amount. I made clear clarification of that in my post. Show me where this has anything to do with the promotion of escorting?",

If you're saying SBs in general should set their minimum according to escort rates, it's not allowed.  These are different activities, plumbers don't set their rates according to what masseuses charge either.   Sugar is not escorting, there is no tie-in, much to the chagrin of those whose business models would benefit.\n\nThat said, on a re-read it looks like you're talking about \"SDs\" who are really johns, treat SBs like escorts, and are doing it to take advantage ... and limited your comments to SDs who are actually johns (as per your previous reply)?  Or are you advocating that generally escort rates should apply as some global minimum for us all?",

They can use this info as they may.

I'm getting MSOG and around the world for less than PPM and I don't have to rent the room or pay for dinner\", we'd flag him on rule 12.   And rightfully so, what a john pays or what he gets for it means fuckall to me, it's not sugar.  Advocating for tying in to escort/john rates is not sugar and is a rule 12 violation.\n\n>I am telling SB's to proactively watch out for men like this, they doexist and they are there to take advantage. SB's need to be warned aboutthe bad side of things. Why would this not be in the best interest ofall to discuss this?\n\nI agree with all this.  SBs are at obvious, serious risk, and part of our most important goals is to protect them; but the position that only escorts and escorts rates can save them is not needed to do that -- and no, not buying into \"SBs should look at escort rates\" does not make men scummy and predatory.    There is no need to look up escort rates, adopt escort processes, or otherwise behave like an escort, in order to do this.   \"what do I get for my money\" \"how much time do I get for that\" are clear john/escort phrases, not sugar phrases.  That's what she needs to learn, He's a john, drop him if you're looking for an SD -- no need to try to tie escort rates in to keep her safe.",

If you're saying SBs in general should set their minimum according to escort rates, it's not allowed.  These are different activities, plumbers don't set their rates according to what masseuses charge either.   Sugar is not escorting, there is no tie-in, much to the chagrin of those whose business models would benefit.\n\nThat said, on a re-read it looks like you're talking about \"SDs\" who are really johns, treat SBs like escorts, and are doing it to take advantage ... and limited your comments to SDs who are actually johns (as per your previous reply)?  Or are you advocating that generally escort rates should apply as some global minimum for us all?",

SB's need to be warned about the bad side of things. Why would this not be in the best interest of all to discuss this? Unless you are literally one of these scummy predatory men, then saying this shouldn't bother you.\n\nNO WHERE am I advocating that SB's should become escorts or charge by the hour. \n\nMy whole point was in advocating for SB's to be aware of predatory men and understand they are out there and to be cautious and aware.

I'm getting MSOG and around the world for less than PPM and I don't have to rent the room or pay for dinner\", we'd flag him on rule 12.   And rightfully so, what a john pays or what he gets for it means fuckall to me, it's not sugar.  Advocating for tying in to escort/john rates is not sugar and is a rule 12 violation.\n\n>I am telling SB's to proactively watch out for men like this, they doexist and they are there to take advantage. SB's need to be warned aboutthe bad side of things. Why would this not be in the best interest ofall to discuss this?\n\nI agree with all this.  SBs are at obvious, serious risk, and part of our most important goals is to protect them; but the position that only escorts and escorts rates can save them is not needed to do that -- and no, not buying into \"SBs should look at escort rates\" does not make men scummy and predatory.    There is no need to look up escort rates, adopt escort processes, or otherwise behave like an escort, in order to do this.   \"what do I get for my money\" \"how much time do I get for that\" are clear john/escort phrases, not sugar phrases.  That's what she needs to learn, He's a john, drop him if you're looking for an SD -- no need to try to tie escort rates in to keep her safe.",

I'm getting MSOG and around the world for less than PPM and I don't have to rent the room or pay for dinner\", we'd flag him on rule 12.   And rightfully so, what a john pays or what he gets for it means fuckall to me, it's not sugar.  Advocating for tying in to escort/john rates is not sugar and is a rule 12 violation.\n\n>I am telling SB's to proactively watch out for men like this, they doexist and they are there to take advantage. SB's need to be warned aboutthe bad side of things. Why would this not be in the best interest ofall to discuss this?\n\nI agree with all this.  SBs are at obvious, serious risk, and part of our most important goals is to protect them; but the position that only escorts and escorts rates can save them is not needed to do that -- and no, not buying into \"SBs should look at escort rates\" does not make men scummy and predatory.    There is no need to look up escort rates, adopt escort processes, or otherwise behave like an escort, in order to do this.   \"what do I get for my money\" \"how much time do I get for that\" are clear john/escort phrases, not sugar phrases.  That's what she needs to learn, He's a john, drop him if you're looking for an SD -- no need to try to tie escort rates in to keep her safe.",

Unless you are literally one of these scummy predatory men, then saying this shouldn't bother you.\n\nNO WHERE am I advocating that SB's should become escorts or charge by the hour. \n\nMy whole point was in advocating for SB's to be aware of predatory men and understand they are out there and to be cautious and aware. They can use this info as they may. I see story after story of women being taken advantage of and at least understanding this side of things they are better prepared to spot men like this and know to value themselves better. Who wouldn't want that?",

If you're saying SBs in general should set their minimum according to escort rates, it's not allowed.  These are different activities, plumbers don't set their rates according to what masseuses charge either.   Sugar is not escorting, there is no tie-in, much to the chagrin of those whose business models would benefit.\n\nThat said, on a re-read it looks like you're talking about \"SDs\" who are really johns, treat SBs like escorts, and are doing it to take advantage ... and limited your comments to SDs who are actually johns (as per your previous reply)?  Or are you advocating that generally escort rates should apply as some global minimum for us all?",
