The reason why many people here and your wife included do not like this look on you is because it breaks many \u201crules\u201d in an unintentional way. Such as being imbalanced and lacking shape, lacking direction. With that being said rules are meant to be broken, but broken rules only look good when they are broken intentionally, not because hair has been neglected to be cut and styled. This hair could be super dope on you if you were to go to a seasoned professional men\u2019s groomer to have it shaped up, textured in an intentional way and to learn how to style it yourself at home. Don\u2019t give up on it yet! Good luck!",

But it\u2019s for the best, because the shape does get kinda wack at a certain point. But it\u2019s so rewarding to see it with the proper shape again even if it does look shorter after waiting all that time lol. \n\nI say go for it, grow it until it gets to the point it\u2019s driving you crazy (for me that was three months and then another month because my barber was off \ud83d\ude02) and then get it shaped properly. \n\nObviously you can just tough it out but there will be rough stages specifically because of the length differences.",

I totally see the Eddie Vedder- inspired end result. Are you picturing 90s Eddie with the genuinely LONG hair, or the more modern, ukulele era Eddie where it is just a bit longer than yours, and more tight and distinguished than when he was younger? I think you would rock the latter look personally. \n\nEither way, I would suggest getting a maintenance cut if you have gone longer than 3-4 months without any cut, especially if you feel your hair grows quick overall. I know you may think that seems counterintuitive to growing your hair, but it\u2019s more about shape. I notice some poofiness towards the lower rear areas that take away from your handsomeness and headshape. A maintenance cut can take care of that sort of issue, and give you a good foundation for *continuing* to grow and looking good *while* you grow it. Again, look at Eddie\u2019s more recent photos. No poofiness. Granted his hair isn\u2019t as thick as yours, but he clearly *does* maintain it. If you don\u2019t already have an awesome barber, look up some with great reviews in your area, and bring some of your favourite Ed photos, and tell them that you want to keep growing your hair, but want some proper shape cut in for while you continue the journey. You may lose a month or so in growth but you won\u2019t really feel it because you have a lot to work with and I bet the difference in quality will be stark. Plus, it may keep the Mrs at bay for a while \ud83d\ude02",

But it\u2019s for the best, because the shape does get kinda wack at a certain point. But it\u2019s so rewarding to see it with the proper shape again even if it does look shorter after waiting all that time lol. \n\nI say go for it, grow it until it gets to the point it\u2019s driving you crazy (for me that was three months and then another month because my barber was off \ud83d\ude02) and then get it shaped properly. \n\nObviously you can just tough it out but there will be rough stages specifically because of the length differences.",
