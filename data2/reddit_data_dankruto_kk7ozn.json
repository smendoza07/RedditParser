I'm just saying this is Naruto, the guy who formed such a strong bond with Sasuke in a relatively small amount of time that he risked his and everyone lives multiple times to prove it, but this is the same guy who won't actually attend his own child's birthday? \n\nAll I'm saying is regardless of personal issues Kishi was having which are fair and might be genuinely true. That shouldn't necessarily reflect that directly in his work to the point his characters act out of character. \n\nAgain just my opinion",

Sure he wanted to have a family too, but he wasn\u2019t screaming that at his friends or opponents at every opportunity. Not saying he\u2019s giving his family the backseat intentionally, but he finally achieved his dream and likely wants to do it to the best of his abilities. Sending a shadow clone to sing and cut cake prolly seemed pretty justifiable to him considering he wanted to be there but still had duties at the office. the work he\u2019s doing is a far cry from his time as a ninja; he was never studious and when fighting he thrived off being unpredictable so paper work and constant meetings are probably more of a drag for him than anything shikamaru has ever experienced in his life.\n\n2. he never had a good example of a father figure/family man. All of his male role models (jiriyah, kakashi, killer bee even) were single dudes who were extremely dedicated to their work. also, many of the adults in the village didn\u2019t want their kids anywhere near him while he was growing up, so he could barely even steal glances of how a traditional family interacts with each other w/o it backfiring on him. \n\nI think his portrayal so far has been accurate and inline with his continued development. It\u2019s all still pretty new to him and he hasn\u2019t found a balance yet.",

A bunch of people say they thought Naruto would/should be a great dad because he didn't have one, but logically speaking the opposite would be more expected. Sasuke's weirder because he actually had a family and knew what it's like to lose that connection. Plus he very clearly knew what was missing from his relationship with his dad. You could say it'd take time for him to overcome being a complete loner, but Naruto and Sakura already broke that barrier, and 12 years is too long for him to adjust to actually being a father.",

The last like, fourth of the show was a massive slog to get through. There's just a lot of legit flaws with Boruto that I see get overlooked in favor of dumb, sometimes false ones.",

An interesting story/story arc. \n\nWhat is done in Boruto the anime (haven\u2019t read the manga yet) is boring as fuck. There are gaping issues with literally everything about it. Really hate what they did to certain characters. Because Boruto doesn\u2019t struggle and just whines about everything there isn\u2019t anything to like him other than he is Naruto/Hinata\u2019s son.

I'm just saying this is Naruto, the guy who formed such a strong bond with Sasuke in a relatively small amount of time that he risked his and everyone lives multiple times to prove it, but this is the same guy who won't actually attend his own child's birthday? \n\nAll I'm saying is regardless of personal issues Kishi was having which are fair and might be genuinely true. That shouldn't necessarily reflect that directly in his work to the point his characters act out of character. \n\nAgain just my opinion",

Sure he wanted to have a family too, but he wasn\u2019t screaming that at his friends or opponents at every opportunity. Not saying he\u2019s giving his family the backseat intentionally, but he finally achieved his dream and likely wants to do it to the best of his abilities. Sending a shadow clone to sing and cut cake prolly seemed pretty justifiable to him considering he wanted to be there but still had duties at the office. the work he\u2019s doing is a far cry from his time as a ninja; he was never studious and when fighting he thrived off being unpredictable so paper work and constant meetings are probably more of a drag for him than anything shikamaru has ever experienced in his life.\n\n2. he never had a good example of a father figure/family man. All of his male role models (jiriyah, kakashi, killer bee even) were single dudes who were extremely dedicated to their work. also, many of the adults in the village didn\u2019t want their kids anywhere near him while he was growing up, so he could barely even steal glances of how a traditional family interacts with each other w/o it backfiring on him. \n\nI think his portrayal so far has been accurate and inline with his continued development. It\u2019s all still pretty new to him and he hasn\u2019t found a balance yet.",

A bunch of people say they thought Naruto would/should be a great dad because he didn't have one, but logically speaking the opposite would be more expected. Sasuke's weirder because he actually had a family and knew what it's like to lose that connection. Plus he very clearly knew what was missing from his relationship with his dad. You could say it'd take time for him to overcome being a complete loner, but Naruto and Sakura already broke that barrier, and 12 years is too long for him to adjust to actually being a father.",

I'm just saying this is Naruto, the guy who formed such a strong bond with Sasuke in a relatively small amount of time that he risked his and everyone lives multiple times to prove it, but this is the same guy who won't actually attend his own child's birthday? \n\nAll I'm saying is regardless of personal issues Kishi was having which are fair and might be genuinely true.

Sure he wanted to have a family too, but he wasn\u2019t screaming that at his friends or opponents at every opportunity. Not saying he\u2019s giving his family the backseat intentionally, but he finally achieved his dream and likely wants to do it to the best of his abilities. Sending a shadow clone to sing and cut cake prolly seemed pretty justifiable to him considering he wanted to be there but still had duties at the office. the work he\u2019s doing is a far cry from his time as a ninja; he was never studious and when fighting he thrived off being unpredictable so paper work and constant meetings are probably more of a drag for him than anything shikamaru has ever experienced in his life.\n\n2. he never had a good example of a father figure/family man. All of his male role models (jiriyah, kakashi, killer bee even) were single dudes who were extremely dedicated to their work. also, many of the adults in the village didn\u2019t want their kids anywhere near him while he was growing up, so he could barely even steal glances of how a traditional family interacts with each other w/o it backfiring on him. \n\nI think his portrayal so far has been accurate and inline with his continued development. It\u2019s all still pretty new to him and he hasn\u2019t found a balance yet.",

A bunch of people say they thought Naruto would/should be a great dad because he didn't have one, but logically speaking the opposite would be more expected. Sasuke's weirder because he actually had a family and knew what it's like to lose that connection. Plus he very clearly knew what was missing from his relationship with his dad. You could say it'd take time for him to overcome being a complete loner, but Naruto and Sakura already broke that barrier, and 12 years is too long for him to adjust to actually being a father.",

I'm just saying this is Naruto, the guy who formed such a strong bond with Sasuke in a relatively small amount of time that he risked his and everyone lives multiple times to prove it, but this is the same guy who won't actually attend his own child's birthday? \n\nAll I'm saying is regardless of personal issues Kishi was having which are fair and might be genuinely true.

Sure he wanted to have a family too, but he wasn\u2019t screaming that at his friends or opponents at every opportunity. Not saying he\u2019s giving his family the backseat intentionally, but he finally achieved his dream and likely wants to do it to the best of his abilities. Sending a shadow clone to sing and cut cake prolly seemed pretty justifiable to him considering he wanted to be there but still had duties at the office. the work he\u2019s doing is a far cry from his time as a ninja; he was never studious and when fighting he thrived off being unpredictable so paper work and constant meetings are probably more of a drag for him than anything shikamaru has ever experienced in his life.\n\n2. he never had a good example of a father figure/family man. All of his male role models (jiriyah, kakashi, killer bee even) were single dudes who were extremely dedicated to their work. also, many of the adults in the village didn\u2019t want their kids anywhere near him while he was growing up, so he could barely even steal glances of how a traditional family interacts with each other w/o it backfiring on him. \n\nI think his portrayal so far has been accurate and inline with his continued development. It\u2019s all still pretty new to him and he hasn\u2019t found a balance yet.",

A bunch of people say they thought Naruto would/should be a great dad because he didn't have one, but logically speaking the opposite would be more expected. Sasuke's weirder because he actually had a family and knew what it's like to lose that connection. Plus he very clearly knew what was missing from his relationship with his dad. You could say it'd take time for him to overcome being a complete loner, but Naruto and Sakura already broke that barrier, and 12 years is too long for him to adjust to actually being a father.",

I'm just saying this is Naruto, the guy who formed such a strong bond with Sasuke in a relatively small amount of time that he risked his and everyone lives multiple times to prove it, but this is the same guy who won't actually attend his own child's birthday? \n\nAll I'm saying is regardless of personal issues Kishi was having which are fair and might be genuinely true. That shouldn't necessarily reflect that directly in his work to the point his characters act out of character. \n\nAgain just my opinion",

Sure he wanted to have a family too, but he wasn\u2019t screaming that at his friends or opponents at every opportunity. Not saying he\u2019s giving his family the backseat intentionally, but he finally achieved his dream and likely wants to do it to the best of his abilities. Sending a shadow clone to sing and cut cake prolly seemed pretty justifiable to him considering he wanted to be there but still had duties at the office. the work he\u2019s doing is a far cry from his time as a ninja; he was never studious and when fighting he thrived off being unpredictable so paper work and constant meetings are probably more of a drag for him than anything shikamaru has ever experienced in his life.\n\n2. he never had a good example of a father figure/family man. All of his male role models (jiriyah, kakashi, killer bee even) were single dudes who were extremely dedicated to their work. also, many of the adults in the village didn\u2019t want their kids anywhere near him while he was growing up, so he could barely even steal glances of how a traditional family interacts with each other w/o it backfiring on him. \n\nI think his portrayal so far has been accurate and inline with his continued development. It\u2019s all still pretty new to him and he hasn\u2019t found a balance yet.",

Sure he wanted to have a family too, but he wasn\u2019t screaming that at his friends or opponents at every opportunity. Not saying he\u2019s giving his family the backseat intentionally, but he finally achieved his dream and likely wants to do it to the best of his abilities. Sending a shadow clone to sing and cut cake prolly seemed pretty justifiable to him considering he wanted to be there but still had duties at the office. the work he\u2019s doing is a far cry from his time as a ninja; he was never studious and when fighting he thrived off being unpredictable so paper work and constant meetings are probably more of a drag for him than anything shikamaru has ever experienced in his life.\n\n2. he never had a good example of a father figure/family man. All of his male role models (jiriyah, kakashi, killer bee even) were single dudes who were extremely dedicated to their work. also, many of the adults in the village didn\u2019t want their kids anywhere near him while he was growing up, so he could barely even steal glances of how a traditional family interacts with each other w/o it backfiring on him. \n\nI think his portrayal so far has been accurate and inline with his continued development. It\u2019s all still pretty new to him and he hasn\u2019t found a balance yet.",

I'm just saying this is Naruto, the guy who formed such a strong bond with Sasuke in a relatively small amount of time that he risked his and everyone lives multiple times to prove it, but this is the same guy who won't actually attend his own child's birthday? \n\nAll I'm saying is regardless of personal issues Kishi was having which are fair and might be genuinely true. That shouldn't necessarily reflect that directly in his work to the point his characters act out of character. \n\nAgain just my opinion",
