    "body": "So I am with this girl whose 27 and has a decent personality for around 4 months.\nin our first few dates she kept hinting that she can be okay with having another girl around or play with other girls (which I really don't like that much)..  Since our third intimidat she said it clearly that she is bi and would like to explore that side. I told her I am okay with that outside the relationship,  but she kept bringing it up.\nThen because of the new Lock down I asked her to move in with me for a few weeks, she agreed and we had a very great time together. And I wanted to make her happy so I agreed to bring a girl to play with.she made it clear that she wanted to select the girl not me.\nThen she told me she found a very nice girl she knew through SA and looks perfect. And she wanted to invite her for the weekend. The new girl came and we had a very nice time and the two seemed to bond so well. They spent most of the weekend together in her room and had just a few hours with me.. we had a few intimate time all together and me with each alone. \nThen the girl offered to stay with us for a week and without an allowance since she can't travel back to her city. She was scared of leaving so I agreed that she can stay and I will continue paying her for the whole week. \nThings didn't really go well. I felt left out the two girls enjoyed each other more than they did with me. I felt terrible and asked the girl to leave at the end of the week. Which was last Friday. \nMy SB didn't like that and reacted badly and cried. After a couple of drinks she told me she has been in a relationship with this girl for a long time and she was afraid if she told me that I would have not accepted.\nI asked the SB to leave and gave her allowance to stay in a hotel or travel.  Now she has been calling and apologizing and asking to reconsider and that she and her gf could both be SBs for me without paying extra allowance.\nThe girls are sweet but I kind of lost the connection and feel I was tricked or cheated. \n\nWas I right and justified to feel betrayed? Am I being over dramatic? Or should I move on?",

            "body": "The easy part is that yes, not telling you was wrong on her part, but making you feel like an outside in your own SR -- and your own home -- is absolutely grounds for considering ending the SR.\n\nThe more difficult questions are the ones you should be asking yourself.  I'd start with why you let in a third person when you were ostensibly quarantining (that was your rationalizing for inviting her to live with you, right?).  You said you wanted to make her happy, which is great, but in light of the rest of the context, I have a feeling this was more about reactively giving in to her, than proactively making her happy.\n\nThen, the girl comes over, they stay together in the room and make you feel like an outsider, and your reaction is ... to let her stay a whole week.  I'm going to be blunt: this is a spineless inability to set and stick with your own boundaries, and is a dangerous (to you) personality flaw in the bowl.  If you'd put your foot down right there, this entire story might have been different -- and more importantly, ended differently.   We often, understandably, see young SBs manipulated or intimidated into not protecting their boundaries; it isn't as often than an SD does it.  Not trying to throw shade, but giving you advice like I'd give an SB who had put herself in a bad position due to not defending her boundaries: do some introspection, and consider leaving the bowl if you can't stick up for yourself.\n\nGood for you for asking her to leave at week's end, and ending the SR.    Like you, I find that this isn't a matter of forgiveness.  If I feel betrayed, that magical love bubble pops and it's not possible to get it back.  I might forgive her, but if the bubble pops, wouldn't be able to re-start the SR.",

His exactly words were \"They spent most of the weekend together in her room and had just a few hours with me\".  There's a difference between taking some personal space, and spending almost no time with your SD/host.\n\n>Arrangements are not a 100% full time job unless it\u2019s serious enough to  where marriage is being discussed or they\u2019re dating without an  allowance.\n\nThat's a strawman -- no one said it's a 100% full time job, so there's no reason to argue that that's not what it is.  But it's also not \"move into his house, lie about bringing in your longterm girlfriend, spend almost no time with your SD and all the time locked away with her\".  I've never been with an SB for a few days and not spent time together, more than just a few hours.\n\nIf this were just about a little personal time, this entire post wouldn't be here.\n\n>\u201cFeeling like an outsider in his own arrangement\u201d sounds very stretched to me.\n\nIt's not stretched, it's basically what he said -- he felt left out\n\nI agree that in the scenario you *invented* \\-- she and the girlfriend hadn't lied about their relationship, and they took some alone time but also spent time with him and made him feel included -- that's no issue at all.  That's basically the dream.  But the actual scenario does not describe that.  If someone posts the scenario you described -- that is, one totally different than in this post -- I'd be with you.",

How could you ever trust her again , she lied from the very beginning and probably only told you since she feared you'd find out first. By allowing this to slide, you're enabling her to continue with her extreme dishonesty and disrespect since she knows she can get away with it and still gets what she wants.\n\nWe have all been so lonely that we will stay with a toxic person since it seems better than being alone..but the shit you have to deal with is never ever worth it and it just eats into your happiness together and for yourself. Plus, the longer you stay with toxic people , the longer you won't meet the right fit since they're making you unavailable, and you will carry the damage you get from the toxic relationship which is going to negatively impact future relationships, may even cause you to avoid the good ones even since we get jaded.\n\nYou deserve so much better and to be valued as the gift you truly are.

And they tried to manipulate you into letting them stay together instead of he my truthful, which they scorekeeper was wrong\n\nIt doesn't seem like a bad setup to me, and my advice would be to try it one more with the request that you want more social time, too, because you felt a little left out.

There's a difference between taking some personal space, and spending almost no time with your SD/host.\n\n>Arrangements are not a 100% full time job unless it\u2019s serious enough to  where marriage is being discussed or they\u2019re dating without an  allowance.\n\nThat's a strawman -- no one said it's a 100% full time job, so there's no reason to argue that that's not what it is.  But it's also not \"move into his house, lie about bringing in your longterm girlfriend, spend almost no time with your SD and all the time locked away with her\".  I've never been with an SB for a few days and not spent time together, more than just a few hours.\n\nIf this were just about a little personal time, this entire post wouldn't be here.\n\n>\u201cFeeling like an outsider in his own arrangement\u201d sounds very stretched to me.\n\nIt's not stretched, it's basically what he said -- he felt left out\n\nI agree that in the scenario you *invented* \\-- she and the girlfriend hadn't lied about their relationship, and they took some alone time but also spent time with him and made him feel included -- that's no issue at all.  That's basically the dream.  But the actual scenario does not describe that.  If someone posts the scenario you described -- that is, one totally different than in this post -- I'd be with you.",

But it's also not \"move into his house, lie about bringing in your longterm girlfriend, spend almost no time with your SD and all the time locked away with her\".  I've never been with an SB for a few days and not spent time together, more than just a few hours.\n\nIf this were just about a little personal time, this entire post wouldn't be here.\n\n>\u201cFeeling like an outsider in his own arrangement\u201d sounds very stretched to me.\n\nIt's not stretched, it's basically what he said -- he felt left out\n\nI agree that in the scenario you *invented* \\-- she and the girlfriend hadn't lied about their relationship, and they took some alone time but also spent time with him and made him feel included -- that's no issue at all.

He feels badly used (which he was). He's hurt (he should be). People telling him to suck it up and not be a drama queen are asking for toxic masculinity. \n\nHe's human, he got used badly, he has feelings, he feels like an object and not a person. He's entitled to be hurt.",
