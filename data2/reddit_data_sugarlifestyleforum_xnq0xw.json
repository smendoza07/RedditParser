    "body": "\nHonestly, I made a post like 2yrs ago complaining about the sugar lifestyle and how racist it is and discriminatory. I feel like we have to work 10x harder to even get half the stuff some of these girls get, and when i posted that...the white american sugar daddies in the forum ate me tf up and were coming with every excuse for why that isnt true. BUT I have figured out ladies...it's simply America. Go where you're celebrated and wanted and for me personally...I flourish in Europe with sugar daddies in every country that are big spenders. They think i am \"exotic\" so thats why it's easier to attract high value men. I recommend countries with no black people like Eastern Europe and Scandinavian/Nordic Countries. But the Mediterranean European countries love us too. I have never been more embraced and sought after than when I go to Europe. It's because they don't really have a lot of black population, so they have no perception of black people and see us as exotic and are generally curious of us. The higher the black population in that country, the less effective i think, because then they have a societal perception of black people. For example, England, very racist, but no surprise they birthed america right? Spain, sorta racist, they have an african immigrant communtiy so some people have a perception of black people when they see us and i personally felt it - but if youre american for some reason its ok to be black then -. Romania, an Eastern European country with no black people,  I was treated very well, getting free stuff everywhere i go from bar owners and restaurants, because they genuinely want to.treat you nice and leave a good perception of the country and people. \n\nAnyways domestically I'd suggest New York because it is more liberal and there are lots of guys with money that honestly don't care what type of girl they spoil, she just has to be attractive to them. \n\nI'd just like to stress that this is my personal experience and what seems to be true for me as of right now. The south never worked for me and I was getting depressed because I didn't know why, but when I traveled abroad...it opened up my eyes. \n\nALSO use dating sites and apps, they have worked for me BETTER  than SA.\n\nTldr: Go where you're wanted and celebrated, not where there is a history and societal norms of hating you.",

The vast majority of the women I saw were white.  Why?  Simple demographics (as you say).  One of the things she complained about to me (in our conversations) was that most guys that showed interest in her - seemed to be more interested in being with her, because she was black, then anything else about her.  Her racial background was a novelty, a checkbox, something to brag about.  Very few people seemed to be interested in her.",

If they want me only to fulfill their fantasy and to brag about it...then give me money, and for me it's THAT simple. If you wanna treat me as an experience and not a human, I'll charge you for this experience (aka pussay lmaooo). For sugar lifestyle fetishization and all sexwork -cause I do other stuff too- fetishization works in my favor because I can charge more/get spoiled more...but outside of that, I don't tolerate it...well unless it benefits me....cause I'm shallow \ud83e\udd23",

I can only speak from my perspective as a relatively small woman -I've been called petite before but idk if I'd say that- and I have troubles as a small black woman. I am curious about the other shapes and sizes of women on SA though, because I wkuld assume in general bigger girls of all races don't particularly frequent SA because generally wealthy men DO enjoy women with a fit frame...but I could see where it comes into play because in the past decade or 2 -and in the black community for years and years before- a bigger and curvy body was desirable, so maybe there are a lot of curvy black women on SA because our body types are being glorified nowadays in mainstream media and culture. However it doesn't translate to the Sugar Bowl...and it's the same for race. I am beautiful period and when I travel I get called beautiful all the time, but it doesn't translate to the sugar bowl I guess because just the demographic of white american men and their prefrences...if that makes sense. So I just learned to travel where my race is a preference or at least not a negative.",

Black women and Hispanic women tend to be on the larger side and that's going to turn off a lot of guys. They go on there only to wonder why guys don't want them. Then they also think they're queens, and have higher standards. I don't like dealing with that shit.\n\nYou look at it like a business, which is what I personally prefer.

Or just read what people have to say all across the internet in their anonymity about black people. My dad who is mixed but mostly white heard all sorts of racists things said about black people in his presence and there are videos of white people confessing racists things they've heard other white people say about black people. Heck our first mixed race president (who isnt even called that) born in Hawaii was harassed and told to go back to Kenya.  Like cmon dude, so much evidence of a racism towards people who are black, mixed, asian, and yes white).\n\nYou are absolutely allowed to have racial preferences. I do (I just dont share them). Most people have a phenotype they prefer. I highly doubt you've versed in the internalized racism issues within the black American community (or that you want to be) so I wouldnt bring up black sds if I were you. Also, given that America is 77% white and white americans tend to have higher income than black americans, there wont be that many black sds for black sbs. No one can demand anyone be interested in them, but the OPs points are valid. Stereotypes have caused a negative perception of black women in the US. Even Asian women get the \"submissive sex doll\" fetish too.",

While there will always be racism....as it us human nature....to label it as purely American shows limited knowledge of the world.    Since just before LBJ was President,  racism was focused on forcing segments of society to engage and integrate.  People were also being shamed.  Then welfare reform was passed which institutionalized the perception of a segment of society.  It also enabled certain people and groups to use \"racism\" as a tool for specific political objectives.   It did not help or improve.\nToday most in this country do not care about racism as it is mostly non existent.  It is manufactured by those seeking to benefit and profit.   Sorry if you disagree, but I can provide reams of examples.  Even Obama used racism to get elected.  He is the perfect example of incompetence being promoted to make certain groups feel good about themselves.   He though, Injected himself into racial issues....mostly on the wrong side.  He is a class a race baiter.  Again, no worries if you disagree.    Unfortunately for those who claim rampant racism,the facts just don't support it.",

America has racism in its roots, have you been to history class baby? To say america isnt racist is ignorant and stupid even. Also if a tall, athletic, black woman with brown hair was to meet you, and she had the perfect personality, and you think \"she is perfect BUT she is black that's the only problem\" then youre racist. I already stated I understand people have preferences, and that's fine, but when it gets to the point you won't choose someone ONLY cause their race, then it becomes a problem...what don't you understand hunny? I am beautiful period. I get plenty of compliments outside the US, it's just the US is racist. As for black sugar daddy's, most black men that are sugar daddies know that white women are a standard of beauty and a symbol of status, that is why you see a lot of wealthy black men with white women, it's still a result of racism and coonery if I'm frank. The other half of black men with money -sports, music, pop culture- tend to go with racially ambiguous women or white, which is why you see racially ambiguous and white women as basketball wives and football wives etc. Even in the black community there is colorism, which is preferring lighter skins over darker skin black people. Racism and colonialism really did a number on america and Americans-including black americans-. For you to say I don't understand preference is ignorant. I prefer european white men because they tend to treat me like a princess and are very generous towards me, HOWEVER, if I met a black man that did treat me the same, or an American white man that treated me the same, I would never say \"no because they are american\" \"no they are black\"",

Havent gotten to whip the sharp tongue out in a while. \n\nI surprisingly don't get that many race related comments and white men show the most interest. I've admittedly taken a step back from online dating in general because the assumptions(not race/ethnicity related), poor reading comprehension and sexual aggressiveness are annoying. Also undeniably in lust with an older man (who's white) so dating is impossible since I imagine his head on every guys body\ud83d\ude0f.\n\nI agree that women of color should go where they're wanted and I'm glad you've been treated well in other countries.

I am curious about the other shapes and sizes of women on SA though, because I wkuld assume in general bigger girls of all races don't particularly frequent SA because generally wealthy men DO enjoy women with a fit frame...but I could see where it comes into play because in the past decade or 2 -and in the black community for years and years before- a bigger and curvy body was desirable, so maybe there are a lot of curvy black women on SA because our body types are being glorified nowadays in mainstream media and culture. However it doesn't translate to the Sugar Bowl...and it's the same for race. I am beautiful period and when I travel I get called beautiful all the time, but it doesn't translate to the sugar bowl I guess because just the demographic of white american men and their prefrences...if that makes sense.

I highly doubt you've versed in the internalized racism issues within the black American community (or that you want to be) so I wouldnt bring up black sds if I were you.

While there will always be racism....as it us human nature....to label it as purely American shows limited knowledge of the world.    Since just before LBJ was President,  racism was focused on forcing segments of society to engage and integrate.  People were also being shamed.  Then welfare reform was passed which institutionalized the perception of a segment of society.  It also enabled certain people and groups to use \"racism\" as a tool for specific political objectives.   It did not help or improve.\nToday most in this country do not care about racism as it is mostly non existent.  It is manufactured by those seeking to benefit and profit.   Sorry if you disagree, but I can provide reams of examples.  Even Obama used racism to get elected.  He is the perfect example of incompetence being promoted to make certain groups feel good about themselves.   He though, Injected himself into racial issues....mostly on the wrong side.  He is a class a race baiter.  Again, no worries if you disagree.    Unfortunately for those who claim rampant racism,the facts just don't support it.",

As for black sugar daddy's, most black men that are sugar daddies know that white women are a standard of beauty and a symbol of status, that is why you see a lot of wealthy black men with white women, it's still a result of racism and coonery if I'm frank. The other half of black men with money -sports, music, pop culture- tend to go with racially ambiguous women or white, which is why you see racially ambiguous and white women as basketball wives and football wives etc. Even in the black community there is colorism, which is preferring lighter skins over darker skin black people. Racism and colonialism really did a number on america and Americans-including black americans-. For you to say I don't understand preference is ignorant. I prefer european white men because they tend to treat me like a princess and are very generous towards me, HOWEVER, if I met a black man that did treat me the same, or an American white man that treated me the same, I would never say \"no because they are american\" \"no they are black\"",

My dad who is mixed but mostly white heard all sorts of racists things said about black people in his presence and there are videos of white people confessing racists things they've heard other white people say about black people. Heck our first mixed race president (who isnt even called that) born in Hawaii was harassed and told to go back to Kenya.  Like cmon dude, so much evidence of a racism towards people who are black, mixed, asian, and yes white).\n\nYou are absolutely allowed to have racial preferences. I do (I just dont share them). Most people have a phenotype they prefer. I highly doubt you've versed in the internalized racism issues within the black American community (or that you want to be) so I wouldnt bring up black sds if I were you. Also, given that America is 77% white and white americans tend to have higher income than black americans, there wont be that many black sds for black sbs. No one can demand anyone be interested in them, but the OPs points are valid. Stereotypes have caused a negative perception of black women in the US.

While there will always be racism....as it us human nature....to label it as purely American shows limited knowledge of the world.    Since just before LBJ was President,  racism was focused on forcing segments of society to engage and integrate.  People were also being shamed.  Then welfare reform was passed which institutionalized the perception of a segment of society.  It also enabled certain people and groups to use \"racism\" as a tool for specific political objectives.   It did not help or improve.\nToday most in this country do not care about racism as it is mostly non existent.  It is manufactured by those seeking to benefit and profit.   Sorry if you disagree, but I can provide reams of examples.  Even Obama used racism to get elected.  He is the perfect example of incompetence being promoted to make certain groups feel good about themselves.   He though, Injected himself into racial issues....mostly on the wrong side.  He is a class a race baiter.  Again, no worries if you disagree.    Unfortunately for those who claim rampant racism,the facts just don't support it.",

I already stated I understand people have preferences, and that's fine, but when it gets to the point you won't choose someone ONLY cause their race, then it becomes a problem...what don't you understand hunny? I am beautiful period. I get plenty of compliments outside the US, it's just the US is racist. As for black sugar daddy's, most black men that are sugar daddies know that white women are a standard of beauty and a symbol of status, that is why you see a lot of wealthy black men with white women, it's still a result of racism and coonery if I'm frank. The other half of black men with money -sports, music, pop culture- tend to go with racially ambiguous women or white, which is why you see racially ambiguous and white women as basketball wives and football wives etc. Even in the black community there is colorism, which is preferring lighter skins over darker skin black people. Racism and colonialism really did a number on america and Americans-including black americans-. For you to say I don't understand preference is ignorant. I prefer european white men because they tend to treat me like a princess and are very generous towards me, HOWEVER, if I met a black man that did treat me the same, or an American white man that treated me the same, I would never say \"no because they are american\" \"no they are black\"",

My dad who is mixed but mostly white heard all sorts of racists things said about black people in his presence and there are videos of white people confessing racists things they've heard other white people say about black people. Heck our first mixed race president (who isnt even called that) born in Hawaii was harassed and told to go back to Kenya.  Like cmon dude, so much evidence of a racism towards people who are black, mixed, asian, and yes white).\n\nYou are absolutely allowed to have racial preferences. I do (I just dont share them). Most people have a phenotype they prefer. I highly doubt you've versed in the internalized racism issues within the black American community (or that you want to be) so I wouldnt bring up black sds if I were you. Also, given that America is 77% white and white americans tend to have higher income than black americans, there wont be that many black sds for black sbs. No one can demand anyone be interested in them, but the OPs points are valid. Stereotypes have caused a negative perception of black women in the US.

While there will always be racism....as it us human nature....to label it as purely American shows limited knowledge of the world.    Since just before LBJ was President,  racism was focused on forcing segments of society to engage and integrate.  People were also being shamed.  Then welfare reform was passed which institutionalized the perception of a segment of society.  It also enabled certain people and groups to use \"racism\" as a tool for specific political objectives.   It did not help or improve.\nToday most in this country do not care about racism as it is mostly non existent.  It is manufactured by those seeking to benefit and profit.   Sorry if you disagree, but I can provide reams of examples.  Even Obama used racism to get elected.  He is the perfect example of incompetence being promoted to make certain groups feel good about themselves.   He though, Injected himself into racial issues....mostly on the wrong side.  He is a class a race baiter.  Again, no worries if you disagree.    Unfortunately for those who claim rampant racism,the facts just don't support it.",

To say america isnt racist is ignorant and stupid even. Also if a tall, athletic, black woman with brown hair was to meet you, and she had the perfect personality, and you think \"she is perfect BUT she is black that's the only problem\" then youre racist. I already stated I understand people have preferences, and that's fine, but when it gets to the point you won't choose someone ONLY cause their race, then it becomes a problem...what don't you understand hunny? I am beautiful period. I get plenty of compliments outside the US, it's just the US is racist. As for black sugar daddy's, most black men that are sugar daddies know that white women are a standard of beauty and a symbol of status, that is why you see a lot of wealthy black men with white women, it's still a result of racism and coonery if I'm frank. The other half of black men with money -sports, music, pop culture- tend to go with racially ambiguous women or white, which is why you see racially ambiguous and white women as basketball wives and football wives etc. Even in the black community there is colorism, which is preferring lighter skins over darker skin black people. Racism and colonialism really did a number on america and Americans-including black americans-. For you to say I don't understand preference is ignorant. I prefer european white men because they tend to treat me like a princess and are very generous towards me, HOWEVER, if I met a black man that did treat me the same, or an American white man that treated me the same, I would never say \"no because they are american\" \"no they are black\"",

While there will always be racism....as it us human nature....to label it as purely American shows limited knowledge of the world.    Since just before LBJ was President,  racism was focused on forcing segments of society to engage and integrate.  People were also being shamed.  Then welfare reform was passed which institutionalized the perception of a segment of society.  It also enabled certain people and groups to use \"racism\" as a tool for specific political objectives.   It did not help or improve.\nToday most in this country do not care about racism as it is mostly non existent.  It is manufactured by those seeking to benefit and profit.   Sorry if you disagree, but I can provide reams of examples.  Even Obama used racism to get elected.  He is the perfect example of incompetence being promoted to make certain groups feel good about themselves.   He though, Injected himself into racial issues....mostly on the wrong side.  He is a class a race baiter.  Again, no worries if you disagree.    Unfortunately for those who claim rampant racism,the facts just don't support it.",
