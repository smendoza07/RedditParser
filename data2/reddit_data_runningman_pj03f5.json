She looks really cool which is nice because we don't often get to see the cool side of Somin (or if we do then the other cast members are there to moan about it lol). \n                            \nNot her matching with JSJ \ud83e\udd72\ud83d\ude02 their bond is so cute.\n                              \nI agree with everyone, Somin and her stylist have been serving looks for the past few months. She was always beautiful and femine but recently it's all the more apparent. Our gorgeous Jeon So Bari \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\ude3b",
