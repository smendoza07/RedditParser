    "body": "So I've been talking with my SB every day for about 2 months now. Because of my schedule we weren't able to meet up, then the holidays came, AND a covid case... So instead we've been talking nonstop and formed a pretty strong connection through phonecalls/texting. We were finally able to do a M&G a couple weeks ago and agreed on starting the arrangement. For the M&G I took her to a really nice restaurant and was planning on taking her to an art museum after. Halfway through lunch she told me  she was really appreciative, but that she's a low maintenaince kind of girl and doesn't really care to do fancy meals or activities. Her preference is just hanging out and getting takeout. Cool, easy. \n\nSo I planned our first intimate date (last saturday). I was going to cook for her, we were going to watch our favorite shows together, and hang out. Now I already knew we are very sexually compatible, but barely 30 minutes into the date we were already going at it. We literally did not get off the bed the remainder of the date. We are both very high sex-drive people with shared, specific kinks so it came very naturally and time flew by. Towards the end of the date we agreed to be exclusive and we did talk a lot during our breaks. What caught me by surprise was that she said this was an ideal date for her. She prefers to meet up and have sex for 3-5 hours. \"I guess we can do lunch sometimes, if you really want to?\" was what she said to me before we left. \n\nWe talked a bit the day after and we are making plans for the next date. I asked her if she meant what she said about only having sex during the dates and she was surprised I was even asking. She has 3-4 friends who also sugar and this how most of their dates go as well.\n\nI do want to make it clear that she is NOT an escort and while I don't know her friends I don't think they are based on the conversations we've had. I know a lot about my SB, honestly she's told me too much personal stuff and I can see us moving towards the SGF/SBF vibe. However, I know SRs are time-limited and I have an idea how long this is going to last. I really want to enjoy what I have, and I'm grateful for it. But honestly, is this normal? Should I expect this on the next go around? Or did I find someone who's just as big of a pervert as I am out of sheer luck? I don't have much experience with real SRs as my last two relationships (3 years ago) I was more of a spoiling boyfriend than anything.",

We have had some other dates - a play, some meals - and we're going out for dinner this week. We make plans!! But they usually don't happen.\n\nIt worries me, but it's also very pleasant to have great sex, then talk, be held and caressed for a few hours. I've expressed my concerns to her, told her I'm happy to do what she likes, and she says this is pretty great for her. I think the only way to change it is to do something else, something public, first. Probably will make that change but between the pandemic and winter, this works.\n\nI've also had SBs who only wanted sex, but that's not my current situation. If the sex is good and not rushed, those SRs worked fine, too, tho they usually didn't last long. At some point a relationship has to be more than sex or if doesn't last, imo. So it either evolves and grows or ends.",

When I was searching, half of my POTs hinted that the only really wanted dinner/drinks and werent looking for much more than that either. But I get the exact opposite feeling from a lot of the SBs here on SLF as well. I'm really happy so far, but I'm trying to gauge if this is more normal than I thought.

I've bed SBs that were top notch that wanted nothing but good hot sex and it ends when I felt my satisfaction stopped when I no longer just need the sex.  Maybe it's just me but after a few weeks it can get too routine.\n\nIf your SB is leading with sex, it's the quickest and fastest way for a SB to gain your trust.  It isn't absolute but usually SB that is really sincere about a long term SR would not lead by sex that fast and that much.  Because even they know that sex driven SR won't last and that will only get tired after a few weeks.\n\nSo no matter what you and her discussed candidly the only way to real long term lasting SR is to slow things down and see what else she can bring for you.  Using sex to create a bond is just too easy.",

This goes beyond a high sex drive and amazing sexual compatibility which is amazing in any relationship. Stay skeptical and keep using condoms for awhile to be safe.\n\nEach arrangement is different and there are a lot of women that just want a sex based arrangement. They're generally prostitutes and escorts though. Finding an actual SB that only wants to have sex is going to be hard and you'll likely end up with a woman that goes along with what you want despite not liking it if you mention to a pot that you're looking for a sex only arrangement. I've talked to a lot of women with near identical stories of how their first arrangement wad awful because they only had sex and she felt used and she didn't know enough to know other types of arrangements are out there.",

So far most of our dates have been at her house and the first thing we do when I arrive is go lie down on her bed.  Her bedroom is now wired into my brain as this portal where orgasms happen and so i'm instantly aroused when I walk in there.  We both feel like we've hit the jackpot and have to pinch ourselves.

I've dated some women who we less into sex than I was, and some who were more into it (eg they just wanted to have sex, they didn't want to go on dates or anything).\n\nI wouldn't feel too surprised -- you're probably a great outlet for her, and if she wants to stay casual and not get into a serious relationship, then it makes sense that she doesn't want to do too much date-type things. I'm not sure if this has the makings of something long-term, but you'll see.",

We start at a hotel with sex (sex first works for me), then some nice cuddling and conversation and suddenly 4 hours have passed and that's all we do. We have had some other dates - a play, some meals - and we're going out for dinner this week. We make plans!! But they usually don't happen.\n\nIt worries me, but it's also very pleasant to have great sex, then talk, be held and caressed for a few hours. I've expressed my concerns to her, told her I'm happy to do what she likes, and she says this is pretty great for her. I think the only way to change it is to do something else, something public, first. Probably will make that change but between the pandemic and winter, this works.\n\nI've also had SBs who only wanted sex, but that's not my current situation. If the sex is good and not rushed, those SRs worked fine, too, tho they usually didn't last long. At some point a relationship has to be more than sex or if doesn't last, imo. So it either evolves and grows or ends.",

I never take it seriously when a SB says they're into older men unless they can really prove to me that we can do something together that isn't transactional at all.  Otherwise it is still just that a transactional fantasy relationship.  I'm trying to put things in perspective, some SBs are very good at being that fantasy for you and everything they say belongs in that fantasy.",

If you are hoping for something long-term, I don\u2019t think it hurts to tell her that, but I do agree that you should try to enjoy it regardless. It\u2019s still meaningful even if it doesn\u2019t last forever. Also, all relationships end differently too so there\u2019s really no way of knowing what to expect and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth worrying about.",
