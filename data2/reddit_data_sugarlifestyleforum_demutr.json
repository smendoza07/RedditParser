    "body": "Hi everyone! Thank you to all of you for reaching out and being such a great support system when I posted about my first SD passing away. This is a different account because I couldn\u2019t remember my password for my previous account (u/slinkyinthebag). I took some time for myself and am finally in a place where I\u2019ve accepted that \u201cD\u201d is not coming back. (He\u2019s probably just watching me judging every move I make). \n\nA little update! I got accepted into my MBA program, I start next fall. I\u2019m also starring in a new TV show as a main character so hopefully it gets good reviews and we all get to keep our jobs\u2014 fingers crossed \ud83e\udd1e. I\u2019m so excited for everything that is coming up. \n\nI wanted to say that I am truly thankful for the sugar bowl. I found someone I really connected with through this world. We supported one another, laughed, cried, traveled\u2014 hell, he even saw me without makeup\u2014 and I saw him at his worst. Yet, we were still beautiful to one another. Oh, and guess the hell what? D\u2019s daughter reached out to me via email shortly after his funeral and wanted to get coffee, I accepted. She\u2019s everything I imagined her to be. D would always talk about her and I already had a picture of what she would be like engraved in my mind. She\u2019s so accepting and full of love. How did I get so lucky? \n\nI know a lot of SR\u2019s don\u2019t work out this way but if you truly care about one another, you\u2019ll show respect to each other and appreciate who you\u2019ve found. Don\u2019t settle for less, find someone that supports you! Whether it be in the sugar bowl, or in the vanilla world. If I end up marrying someone that\u2019s an asshole to me, D promised he\u2019d set my pillow on fire in the middle of the night whether he\u2019s alive or dead. When that time comes, I\u2019ll file for divorce that same day. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019ll be commenting every now and then giving our newbies advice. So a little message to the new SB\u2019s... please do your research before posting. If you\u2019re asking if it\u2019s a scam or not, it most likely is. If it sounds too good to be true, it most likely is. If he asks to meet in his hotel room on the first meeting, don\u2019t freaking go. Sugaring should be supplemental to your life, not a primary income. I hope you all meet someone who is good to you and supports you even after they\u2019re no longer here. Have a good day everyone, I hope you see me on TV \ud83d\ude0a",
