It's also why we don't see Obito nor Yamato age fast, despite having th3 healing from Hashirama Cells attached to them. And Wolverine survived for hundreds of years, whereas Hashirama didn't even survive for 90 (since we never see him old). Deadpool's healing factor keeps him alive regardless of whatever hits him, even before the curse, without it speeding up his aging process. \nSo yeah, Hashirama, along with his children, is dead for no given reason, as it doesn't affect the plot in any way",

And Wolverine survived for hundreds of years, whereas Hashirama didn't even survive for 90 (since we never see him old).

Hashirama having his Cells give passive healing doesn't require any jutsu activation, therefore there's no speed up of aging. It's also why we don't see Obito nor Yamato age fast, despite having th3 healing from Hashirama Cells attached to them. And Wolverine survived for hundreds of years, whereas Hashirama didn't even survive for 90 (since we never see him old). Deadpool's healing factor keeps him alive regardless of whatever hits him, even before the curse, without it speeding up his aging process. \nSo yeah, Hashirama, along with his children, is dead for no given reason, as it doesn't affect the plot in any way",
