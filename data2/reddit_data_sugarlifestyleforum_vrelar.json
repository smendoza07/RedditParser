THEY won't be stuck with an incurable disease, THEY don't want (more) children so it doesn't matter if their fertility is ruined. \n\n\n2. They don't care about women. They don't give a shit what happens to you as long as it doesn't affect them. They do not care about you, they only put their orgasm first.",

That's a worst case scenario if certain diseases are left undetected and untreated.\n2. That is a hell of a leap. \"You aren't as afraid as me because you don't care about women?\" Fuck off. I love the women in my life. I just haven't let the scare mongering sex ed program me the way you have.\n\nMost people aren't sick. Even if someone is sick, they aren't necessarily contagious. Even if someone is sick and contagious, transmission is unlikely. Even if they are sick, they are contagious, and there is transmission assuming it's going to be the worst case of the worst thing is far from likely. Plenty of diseases your immune system would eventually beat even without medicine. \n\nI'm not saying not to use condoms, but stop scaremongering. Get on PrEP. Get vaccinated for HPV, and then stop worrying because you've done what you can do unless you want to be a bubble boy. Most people are gonna be just fine. You don't point at people who die from the flu and say \"well that's what they get for leaving the house!\" Some things are out of your control. You could die in highway crash tomorrow and if you go on the highway that is far more likely than anything we're talking about here. So stop driving, and have sex instead. It's way safer!",

You think something terrible but rare is going to happen to them, which would make them special. They think nothing will happen to them which is the most likely outcome. You think they're special. They think they're typical.\n\nBirth control pills are safe and effective for most women. IUDs are safe and effective for most women. If the hormones mess with you, get a copper one. If you are the rare person none of this works for, well unfortunately we don't have reversable birth control methods for men, but a vasectomy takes about 20 minutes in a doctor's office and is an outpatient procedure. The odds of it failing are lower than that you'll die in a highway wreck, so again, before you worry about that keep off the highways. They are death traps.",

I am confident I don't have anything because I test a few weeks after every new partner (or at a minimum every 3 months if I'm not with anyone new), as do all my regular partners. I talk about testing with every new partner. I am on PrEP, which works better than condoms at preventing AIDS. Antibiotic resistant strains are still incredibly rare. Whatever you are afraid of you probably aren't being realistic about. Condoms don't protect against HPV and herpes, but those mostly don't matter and everybody ends up carrying them, and it mostly is fine. Odds are good you've got them right now and it's gonna be fine. \n\nWhy are you confident we should be worried?",

The virus might set up shop in your spinal cord or behind your ear depending on which you get, but they shed from all mucus membranes and shedding can happen without and outbreak. The only way to totally avoid HSV is to ensure you have up to date tests before you ever kiss anyone. If you want to do that then be my guest, but I think it's excessive. \n\nFurthermore, most people with HSV never have an outbreak or have them extremely infrequently or mildly.\n\nHSV is kinda nasty but it doesn't scare me.

I\u2019m very upfront with POTs that I\u2019m unable to use hormonal birth control due to health reasons. In the wake of Roe being overturned, condoms are nonnegotiable for me. \n\nI am completely and totally pro-choice, but I personally don\u2019t want to go through that experience. Not to mention it\u2019s not exactly like SBs have a contingency plan. It takes weeks for your body to recover enough to safely have sex again, and how many SDs are ready, willing, and able to supplement whatever interruption of the SB\u2019s lifestyle such an event would create? \n\nOne of the other SBs advised making rainy day abortion fund a condition of arrangements moving forward, and I completely agree. The stakes just keep going higher and perhaps SDs will take it seriously when it hits them in the most painful place: their wallets.\n\nMuch like with vanilla dating, I think that if a SD is giving a SB grief about using a condom when the two haven\u2019t done much as had a meetcute yet\u2014never mind building up trust\u2014that\u2019s an indicator that they will likely be disrespectful about other boundaries one tries to set.

Kills more than just sperm.   \n\nIf a guy complains he can't get off as easily with a condom can just show him just how good you are with your hands.  Or mouth.  Though hands csn impress the most if you actually learn how to do it right.  (Far too many women do not know)   \n\nIf he still wants PIV to get off can still use hands first to get him so worked up and close that he will get off more easily with the condom after.  Also can use hands during intercourse, especially with the testicles.  \n\nIn short, one of the better ways to persuade a guy of the joys of safer sex is to demonstrate ways you can bring him mind blowing pleasure using other techniques.  So.you aren't just saying \"no\" but you are saying \"hell yes \" to a bunch of other things.",

There are two involved and whatever your choice may be it 100% affects another person. This is not a matter of abortion rights/your body your choice situation.

For those who do get symptoms they are uncomfortable or painful from time to time but not a big deal otherwise.\n\nIt's also worth noting that even with 100% unprotected sex with a partner who has a given disease the rate of transmission is extremely low. Usually they track it by looking at the chances of contracting the disease per year if your partner has it. The chances of contracting anything from a partner in a given sexual encounter are very low, even if they have an active outbreak. The exceptions are all bacterial infections with cures. I'm not saying you can just do whatever and never suffer any consequences but being paranoid is also pointless. There's this idea that if you accidentally rub your cock against her vag during foreplay you're going to get AIDS and die and that's just not how it works.\n\nObviously I don't want any STDs, and I take precautions... but I'm not going to use a fucking dental dam and live my life in fear either. Yes, if I kiss a pretty girl I might get herpes or something. I also might get hit by a meteor or struck by lightning tomorrow. I don't live my life cowering in fear, but I will take reasonable precautions when warranted. \n\nI also choose my partners carefully. Going entirely bareback with any random partner is fucking stupid and reckless, but you cannot pass the seriously dangerous diseases otherwise.",

I love the women in my life. I just haven't let the scare mongering sex ed program me the way you have.\n\nMost people aren't sick. Even if someone is sick, they aren't necessarily contagious. Even if someone is sick and contagious, transmission is unlikely. Even if they are sick, they are contagious, and there is transmission assuming it's going to be the worst case of the worst thing is far from likely. Plenty of diseases your immune system would eventually beat even without medicine. \n\nI'm not saying not to use condoms, but stop scaremongering. Get on PrEP. Get vaccinated for HPV, and then stop worrying because you've done what you can do unless you want to be a bubble boy. Most people are gonna be just fine. You don't point at people who die from the flu and say \"well that's what they get for leaving the house!\" Some things are out of your control. You could die in highway crash tomorrow and if you go on the highway that is far more likely than anything we're talking about here. So stop driving, and have sex instead. It's way safer!",

IUDs are safe and effective for most women. If the hormones mess with you, get a copper one. If you are the rare person none of this works for, well unfortunately we don't have reversable birth control methods for men, but a vasectomy takes about 20 minutes in a doctor's office and is an outpatient procedure. The odds of it failing are lower than that you'll die in a highway wreck, so again, before you worry about that keep off the highways. They are death traps.",

That sounds to me like puritanical sex ed talking. I am confident I don't have anything because I test a few weeks after every new partner (or at a minimum every 3 months if I'm not with anyone new), as do all my regular partners. I talk about testing with every new partner. I am on PrEP, which works better than condoms at preventing AIDS. Antibiotic resistant strains are still incredibly rare. Whatever you are afraid of you probably aren't being realistic about. Condoms don't protect against HPV and herpes, but those mostly don't matter and everybody ends up carrying them, and it mostly is fine. Odds are good you've got them right now and it's gonna be fine. \n\nWhy are you confident we should be worried?",

Go read accounts of average people who get outbreaks; most of the time they aren't terrible, and the people who go online to talk about it are usually the worst cases.\n\nYou can also get HSV 1 AND 2 from kissing someone. The virus might set up shop in your spinal cord or behind your ear depending on which you get, but they shed from all mucus membranes and shedding can happen without and outbreak. The only way to totally avoid HSV is to ensure you have up to date tests before you ever kiss anyone. If you want to do that then be my guest, but I think it's excessive. \n\nFurthermore, most people with HSV never have an outbreak or have them extremely infrequently or mildly.\n\nHSV is kinda nasty but it doesn't scare me.

Keeping a condom in your pocket or wallet also exposes them to friction, which increases both heat and risk of tears.*\n\nhttps://www.trojanbrands.com/en/sex-information/condom-storage-and-expiration\n\n<cue The More You Know gif>",

I just had to sever a POT SD situation because he wouldn\u2019t agree to wrap it up. \n\nI know that your point was about STIs, but I can\u2019t stop thinking about the increasingly dangerous complication of pregnancy. I\u2019m very upfront with POTs that I\u2019m unable to use hormonal birth control due to health reasons. In the wake of Roe being overturned, condoms are nonnegotiable for me. \n\nI am completely and totally pro-choice, but I personally don\u2019t want to go through that experience. Not to mention it\u2019s not exactly like SBs have a contingency plan. It takes weeks for your body to recover enough to safely have sex again, and how many SDs are ready, willing, and able to supplement whatever interruption of the SB\u2019s lifestyle such an event would create? \n\nOne of the other SBs advised making rainy day abortion fund a condition of arrangements moving forward, and I completely agree. The stakes just keep going higher and perhaps SDs will take it seriously when it hits them in the most painful place: their wallets.\n\nMuch like with vanilla dating, I think that if a SD is giving a SB grief about using a condom when the two haven\u2019t done much as had a meetcute yet\u2014never mind building up trust\u2014that\u2019s an indicator that they will likely be disrespectful about other boundaries one tries to set.

Your one off sexual encounter a few times a year from tinder is not daily sex work. \n\nSecondly, I never said anyone should go raw with anyone.

There are two involved and whatever your choice may be it 100% affects another person. This is not a matter of abortion rights/your body your choice situation. Someone else is involved and it affects their lives too. \n\n> You only come into contact with her previous partners if they gave her something. \n\nAnd the fact that you don\u2019t know anything about anyone, and just pointing out that we\u2019re on a sugar lifestyle forum sub here, that is a high risk to take.

IUDs are safe and effective for most women. If the hormones mess with you, get a copper one. If you are the rare person none of this works for, well unfortunately we don't have reversable birth control methods for men, but a vasectomy takes about 20 minutes in a doctor's office and is an outpatient procedure. The odds of it failing are lower than that you'll die in a highway wreck, so again, before you worry about that keep off the highways. They are death traps.",

That sounds to me like puritanical sex ed talking. I am confident I don't have anything because I test a few weeks after every new partner (or at a minimum every 3 months if I'm not with anyone new), as do all my regular partners. I talk about testing with every new partner. I am on PrEP, which works better than condoms at preventing AIDS. Antibiotic resistant strains are still incredibly rare. Whatever you are afraid of you probably aren't being realistic about. Condoms don't protect against HPV and herpes, but those mostly don't matter and everybody ends up carrying them, and it mostly is fine. Odds are good you've got them right now and it's gonna be fine. \n\nWhy are you confident we should be worried?",

Go read accounts of average people who get outbreaks; most of the time they aren't terrible, and the people who go online to talk about it are usually the worst cases.\n\nYou can also get HSV 1 AND 2 from kissing someone. The virus might set up shop in your spinal cord or behind your ear depending on which you get, but they shed from all mucus membranes and shedding can happen without and outbreak. The only way to totally avoid HSV is to ensure you have up to date tests before you ever kiss anyone. If you want to do that then be my guest, but I think it's excessive. \n\nFurthermore, most people with HSV never have an outbreak or have them extremely infrequently or mildly.\n\nHSV is kinda nasty but it doesn't scare me.

Digital dating has been around for a long time hun, and just because you are on there doesn't mean you are getting laid, especially for men. I sad the AVERAGE person isnt getting laid everyday. An attractive woman can get laid every day multiple times a day with a different guy of her choosing of course, but that's not the norm. Your one off sexual encounter a few times a year from tinder is not daily sex work. \n\nSecondly, I never said anyone should go raw with anyone. But I'm not going to sit here and tell other people what their sexual preferences should be and what to do with their body. We have enough Republicans in the country for that. You wanna be safe? Abstinence is the only thing that's going to be safe, because you can still get stis even with condoms.",

And if you have sex one time with a person you\u2019re basically having contracting anything and everything that person has from every person they\u2019ve had sex with. It\u2019s not the matter of frequency here. It\u2019s a one and done kind of thing. And if you aren\u2019t getting laid as a guy, when you do have sex with a woman that has had a high number of partners you come into contact with all those they have had sex with.\n\nYou\u2019re not telling people what to do, but you are trying to justify why safe sex isn\u2019t the better option. 100% incorrect. And sexual preferences is different from safe sex. Using a whip during sex is different from choosing to protect yourself from an incurable disease, hun.",

There are two involved and whatever your choice may be it 100% affects another person. This is not a matter of abortion rights/your body your choice situation. Someone else is involved and it affects their lives too. \n\n> You only come into contact with her previous partners if they gave her something. \n\nAnd the fact that you don\u2019t know anything about anyone, and just pointing out that we\u2019re on a sugar lifestyle forum sub here, that is a high risk to take. If you are in a vanilla relationship and trust is established then great have that adult conversation. In the sugar bowl it\u2019s a completely different playing field.",

IUDs are safe and effective for most women. If the hormones mess with you, get a copper one. If you are the rare person none of this works for, well unfortunately we don't have reversable birth control methods for men, but a vasectomy takes about 20 minutes in a doctor's office and is an outpatient procedure. The odds of it failing are lower than that you'll die in a highway wreck, so again, before you worry about that keep off the highways. They are death traps.",

There are two involved and whatever your choice may be it 100% affects another person. This is not a matter of abortion rights/your body your choice situation. Someone else is involved and it affects their lives too. \n\n> You only come into contact with her previous partners if they gave her something. \n\nAnd the fact that you don\u2019t know anything about anyone, and just pointing out that we\u2019re on a sugar lifestyle forum sub here, that is a high risk to take. If you are in a vanilla relationship and trust is established then great have that adult conversation. In the sugar bowl it\u2019s a completely different playing field.",

There are two involved and whatever your choice may be it 100% affects another person. This is not a matter of abortion rights/your body your choice situation. Someone else is involved and it affects their lives too. \n\n> You only come into contact with her previous partners if they gave her something. \n\nAnd the fact that you don\u2019t know anything about anyone, and just pointing out that we\u2019re on a sugar lifestyle forum sub here, that is a high risk to take. If you are in a vanilla relationship and trust is established then great have that adult conversation. In the sugar bowl it\u2019s a completely different playing field.",

Someone else is involved and it affects their lives too. \n\n> You only come into contact with her previous partners if they gave her something. \n\nAnd the fact that you don\u2019t know anything about anyone, and just pointing out that we\u2019re on a sugar lifestyle forum sub here, that is a high risk to take. If you are in a vanilla relationship and trust is established then great have that adult conversation. In the sugar bowl it\u2019s a completely different playing field.",
