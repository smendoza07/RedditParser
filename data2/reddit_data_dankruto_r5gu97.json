And you want to talk about \"literal retardation\". Context clues should've gave that away.\n\n\n> This is literal retardation\n\nI already exposed the irony in your making that statement and immediately following it with a low iq response. But also saying \"this is stupid\" isn't an argument to a completely factual statement. Oro was damn near on his deathbed taking that fight, he was bedridden immediately after. Prove me wrong. And prove why that does not make a significant difference in his fighting ability.",

So while that still probably makes Orochimaru stronger than a good amount of them, he'd still lose to all of them at once...unless he gets his arms back lmfao.",

So while that still probably makes Orochimaru stronger than a good amount of them, he'd still lose to all of them at once...unless he gets his arms back lmfao.",

But also saying \"this is stupid\" isn't an argument to a completely factual statement. Oro was damn near on his deathbed taking that fight, he was bedridden immediately after. Prove me wrong. And prove why that does not make a significant difference in his fighting ability.",

A beast just has large chakra reserves nothing else, a beast itself is very weak, it's either controlled like by madara or obito or befriended by jinchuriki when it becomes strong.Only thing the tailed beasts have is there tailed beast bomb. Chakra is useless if you can't use it effectively. A weakened orochimaru who wasn't able to do any jutsus was stronger than 4 tails",
