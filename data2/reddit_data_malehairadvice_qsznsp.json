Will you go paraben/sulfate free to enhance your curl pattern and make it flippy? Then you gotta get the right length. And a barber doesn\u2019t do these cuts. You have to call around and ask for a stylist that specifically does short cuts, or check their IG. Bc not all stylists like to do pixis and short bobs. This is an *extremely* textured and layered, angular blunt bob type cut and it will look right if you have curls. \n\nThis cut will look like shit if you have straight hair, thin hair, overly thick hair or don\u2019t take care of your curls and let them be frizzy. This isn\u2019t maintence free and it isn\u2019t a cheap cut either. Think $80-100+. And products are what gift it the wispy, piecey effect. Those emo kids spent hella time in the bathroom in 2002.",
