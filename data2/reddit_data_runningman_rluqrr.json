Seems like somin has to play it either with member or guest, don't get me wrong, but it seems she has to portray love frog Persona. It gives other members something to react and give one liners. YJS said he doesn't like it and before that he said somin is happiest when doing something with Sechan. Sechan is nervous and forced to react and give laughter. \n\nThey have pushed it from cute tiki taka to full on flirting. With hardly any guests this year, loveline is brought back for members to talk and react and fill minutes. Somehow they want to show chemistry like they showed for those two idols a few episodes back. They should add a new member and have him part of love line for adding something new. Kjk ended the love line as it doesn't help him in any way. \n\nAnother issue with love line when choice comes between guest and somin, Sechan has to choose somin for sake of love line and his interactions with guests becomes less ex: couldn't support Yooa, partnered with Yuna but entire episode focused on somin. Hardly any interaction with Hanna as they keep talking about love line.",
