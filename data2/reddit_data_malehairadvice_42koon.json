Half of you guys wouldn't even suit any of these cuts and you've gotta stop fantasising about haircuts that are never gonna work with your hair and will just end up making you look silly. I'm not complaining about this album being posted. It's just that if you guys think this encompasses a broad list of hairstyles for different looking people, and you're not one of the strong jawed stunning models with tameable thick brown hair, you're going to end up looking ridiculous. This subreddit has gotta stop recommending the same shit to everyone because it just doesn't work.",

Speaking personally, I'm finally making the swap away from a 10 year old+ hair style and this general style will work for me, but I needed to understand which varieties are out there and what was feasible so I could attempt to carve my own style out as it relates specifically to my hair and its quirks. \n\nRelating to what you said I think a lot of people get caught up in the mentality of just going for what's easy instead of thinking for themselves and taking the time to feel out how their own body (or head of hair) works and what works for them given the copious ways we vary person to person.\n\nEdit: Someone further down in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/malehairadvice/comments/42koon/great_set_of_photos_showcasing_differences_in/czc40x8) found the actual OP Facebook post and it had more hairstyles. I would encourage everyone to take a 2nd look as there were about 14 more for a total of 26 that I've updated to the imgur link as well. Though most still follow the style you're referring to. So what you're saying does still stand. :)",

Speaking personally, I'm finally making the swap away from a 10 year old+ hair style and this general style will work for me, but I needed to understand which varieties are out there and what was feasible so I could attempt to carve my own style out as it relates specifically to my hair and its quirks. \n\nRelating to what you said I think a lot of people get caught up in the mentality of just going for what's easy instead of thinking for themselves and taking the time to feel out how their own body (or head of hair) works and what works for them given the copious ways we vary person to person.\n\nEdit: Someone further down in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/malehairadvice/comments/42koon/great_set_of_photos_showcasing_differences_in/czc40x8) found the actual OP Facebook post and it had more hairstyles. I would encourage everyone to take a 2nd look as there were about 14 more for a total of 26 that I've updated to the imgur link as well. Though most still follow the style you're referring to. So what you're saying does still stand. :)",
