Obviously the original plan had been for the two MC friends to have a friendly rivalry with their teams, but during those first couple months of shows, it became evident that the stronger (physical and forceful personality) Jong Kook was a much better foil for the self-deprecating underdog Jae Suk. \n\nI felt bad for Suk Jin for a while that he had to step back and kind of remake himself as a sort of sad sack sidekick to Jae Suk and big brother to Kwang Soo, but he embraced both roles and persevered. He took what the producers gave him (Race Starter, Big Nose, Easy Brother, and awkward dad in the third team with Monday Couple) and made that his path to screen time while others flourished more conventionally.\n\nSuk Jin's never been my favorite (I find a lot of his role to be cringe and didn't like how he was useless as a partner to so many guests, kind of ruining their experience), but I respect that he accepted what was essentially an on-screen demotion for years and still worked hard to help make the show as good as he could.",
