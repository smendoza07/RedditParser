I'm guessing it's more so his own unique style of Sage Mode that's kind of like Mitsuki's Sage Mode which Orochimaru stated to be a special kind that's only for him. I think technically anyone could use Sage Mode if they can understand the fundamentals of implementing nature energy into their chakra pool, so maybe there's a large variety of different kinds of Sage Modes? Idk, just my two cents.",

Minato can use him anytime as a portal to get in and out of any hidden village and kill that dude when he's shitting or something by sneaking behind him.

I can\u2019t see any reason why someone wouldn\u2019t, for example, learn of sage mode in a book written by a sage which gives great detail on the workings of sage mode, and then through years of self study, be able to use it themselves, provided they don\u2019t fuck up and kill themselves by absorbing too much nature chakra.\n\nEven if Kakashi\u2019s summons could teach him sage mode, he doesn\u2019t have enough of his own chakra to learn it. You need to have a large chakra pool so you can take in enough nature chakra without just drowning yourself in it and dying. I mean Naruto would start transforming into a toad seconds after beginning to absorb nature chakra, if he didn\u2019t have such a massive chakra pool of his own that he needed to match the nature chakra to, he would\u2019ve turned to a toad even quicker and easier.",

The problem is when you first learn to take in nature chakra, you can\u2019t control how fast you take it in, so if you have a small chakra reserve of your own you have far less time before the nature energy surpasses the physical and spiritual energies. Naruto has huge chakra reserves but he was turning into a toad in seconds of taking in nature energy when he first started to learn, so someone like Kakashi might just instantly turn to stone as soon as they start absorbing nature energy because they can\u2019t slow the intake.",

In part 1, we literally see Kakashi (funnily enough) training with the intent to increase his chakra, so we know it is possible. Chakra is explained to us at the beginning to be a mix of physical and spiritual energy, and Kakashi was training his physical.\n\nAnyway, by shippuden, the only ninja in Konoha more physically fit than Kakashi is Might Guy himself, yet his chakra pools are still lower than you'd expect. Surely the sharingan can't be draining all of it? \n\nThis is a little headcanon here that I use to explain it for myself, you can ignore it if you want. I think after he met his father in purgatory, Kakashi released a mental block he had for the past decade, and that is what allowed his spiritual energy to be utilised properly, so his chakra basically doubled since it's based on both physical and spiritual. I think a similar thing also happened after he got Obito's forgiveness and lost the DMS. \n\nThat is all headcanon and not confirmed though, but what we do know, his chakra *did* massively increase, or his war arc feats couldn't make sense.\n\nAs for sage mode, Minato attained perfect sage mode in what we assume is around a couple years, Naruto did so in a matter of months. Kakashi and Minato are very close in intelligence, and post shippuden Kakashi has better chakra control and more chakra (I made another comment below the parent of this one explaining the fear that proves so), so he should also be able to learn sage mode in a similar timespan that Minato did.\n\nAlso about your last point, after absorbing it into the Hashirama cells on his face, Madara actually did learn to balance sage mode with his own chakra (he said something along the lines of \"so this is the legendary sage chakra, and here I thought it would be more difficult to control\"). Also if he didn't learn to balance sage chakra he would have lost his mind after absorbing the Juubi.\n\n\nHonestly, Boruto era, the people who should have mastered should be: All of team 7 (Naruto has, Sasuke has shown an affinity to it multiple times, Kakashi could learn a form of it, and there is probably some slug sage Sakura could find out about), and for plot reasons only, Konohamaru.",

He surrounds the entire Hidden leaf village with a quartz wall, for over 24 hours. Just to break down how insane this is:\n\nQuartz wall is a jutsu that was theoretical, but unanimously agreed to be 100% impossible to preform, since nobody could ever have the amount of chakra control and precision to make it work. Despite that, Kakashi actually invented it and uses it in combat. The very creation of this jutsu shows his chakra control is 6 path level.\n\nQuartz wall could be simplified as being the ultimate form of mud wall (this is kinda doing it a disservice). No shinobi in history has ever held a mud wall for over 12 hours, or been able to cover an entire city with it. To do both at the same time is a little incomprehensible. And this isn't a mud wall, it's a jutsu that should already be impossible to preform.\n\nSo basically he covered all of konoha with a nearly unbreakable wall for over a whole day using only his own chakra reserves. We've only seen 1 feat similar to this, and that's when Gara, with Shukaku inside him, covered only the ceiling of the hidden sand, which is much smaller than the hidden leaf, for a few seconds, with a jutsu that he had already been practising his entire life and was first nature to him. If you compare the two feats, it shows just how insane Kakashi's chakra has become post shippuden.",

Being the only natural Wood style user it wouldn't be to much of a stretch to believe he would have some supernatural connection to nature and Natural Chakra. \n\nHell, Sage mode is called Senjutsu. His clan are the Senju. \n\nHead cannon wise it would also explain Hashirama cells. His body has some supernatural affinity toward sage mode. That would explain the wood style (nature/Natural Chakra) and his ability to heal so quickly (being able to constantly absorb natural energy and a safe rate, absent mindedly) and I feel like you could attribute that to his early death. Naruto knows that if you absorb too much Natural Chakra too quickly you turn to stone. What if Hashirama was always absorbing Natural Chakra without the ability to turn it off? He could have had a slow siphon of Natural Chakra his entire life that eventually led to his early death.\n\nOn that same note you could also apply that to his \"God of Shinobi\" title. Hashirama very well could have been and accidental sage since a small child. Always infusing small amounts of Natural Chakra into all of his Taijutsu and Ninjutsu. With age he could have developed his ability thus allowing him to use more and more Natural Chakra with his own. \n\nI'm running with this theory from now on.",

He is also the most famous shinobi of all time, so everyone would want a piece of that. Jugo\u2019s clan has sage abilities that only Orochimaru was able to uncover, study, understand and use. Plus they were such a violent and outlier clan that they were avoided by everyone else. If their abilities (or rather the secret to their abilities) were as well-known no doubt their enzymes would be in as much demand as the byakugan or the sharingan. They are also presumed extinct with the only surviving member in a secret medical facility owned by Orochimaru. \n\nAs to the ability, lots of tiny clans are offshoots of larger clans but still have unique clan-specific abilities. The abilities often skip multiple generations and show up later in the family tree. A good example of this is Kimimaro and his unique technique that came all the way from Kaguya. It\u2019s conceivable that given time he would have created a sub-clan all with that ability. Wood release has not been seen since Hashirama, but there is no reason not to think it will not resurface in the future in the same way Kimimaro\u2019s did, even though the other well-known Senju members didn\u2019t inherit it. \n\nIn summary, perhaps kekkei genkai is the wrong name for this. It\u2019s a \u201ckekkei genkai in progress\u201d, a special ability that starts in an individual but given time, luck and selective breeding (like the Hyuuga and Uchiha for instance) would undoubtedly have the potential to be clan-wide. I believe Jugo\u2019s clan was the result of this. Their violent tendencies isolated them meaning they were unable to intermarry, giving the trait a chance to concentrate and become clan-specific.",

One thousand hands is associated with Buddhism, because of some particular form of Buddha having a thousand hands (there's even a huge and famous statue in china that depicts it; also I'm oversimplifying here), and Buddha himself was a sage.\n\nSo in conclusion, good theory",

            "body": "There are three possible answers to this. \n\nThe first one is training in Shikkotsu Forest under the Great Slug Sage. This is highly unlikely because there is no mention of it anywhere and the only reason people claim this to be Hashirama's sage mode is because Tsunade is known as the slug queen and her summoning animal is Katsuyu. Tsunade's black patterns are from mitotic regeneration jutsu which is a ninjutsu created by her and not senjutsu, she was never a sage. \n\nThe second theory is that since Naruto and Kabuto are both representative of their representative animal (Toad, Snake) in their sage mode patterns (specially around the eyes), Hashirama's sage mode must be connected to monkeys since his patterns look very similar to Enma. This is just based on the visual similarity and can be just as right or wrong as you want it to be. \n\nLastly, the most probable theory is that Hashirama didn't learn sage mode from any great sage but instead learned on his own how to collect nature energy. Again, no factual proof but very likely given that even his summonings are not related to any animal of nature. At one point he summoned the quintuplet Rashomon gates whereas his common summoning is the wood golem. \n\nEither way there is no way of telling if any of these are true so it's up to you to pick a hill to die on.",

He flexed so hard by just straight up ignoring Ay's Lightning Cloak. He blitzed right to Bee and Ay had to give up or sacrifice the most important person to him. Minato is the true GOAT.",

Minato could slip in a seal on someone's body with his shadow clone by confronting a fake skirmish. Make it look like he lost and kill his clone. Then when the Shinobi returns to his village, he's a frigging time bomb. Minato can use him anytime as a portal to get in and out of any hidden village and kill that dude when he's shitting or something by sneaking behind him. Minatos jutsu is so dangerously unpredictable and if you are as clever like minato, you would probably be damn creative in ways to use it.",

I can\u2019t see any reason why someone wouldn\u2019t, for example, learn of sage mode in a book written by a sage which gives great detail on the workings of sage mode, and then through years of self study, be able to use it themselves, provided they don\u2019t fuck up and kill themselves by absorbing too much nature chakra.\n\nEven if Kakashi\u2019s summons could teach him sage mode, he doesn\u2019t have enough of his own chakra to learn it. You need to have a large chakra pool so you can take in enough nature chakra without just drowning yourself in it and dying. I mean Naruto would start transforming into a toad seconds after beginning to absorb nature chakra, if he didn\u2019t have such a massive chakra pool of his own that he needed to match the nature chakra to, he would\u2019ve turned to a toad even quicker and easier.",

The problem is when you first learn to take in nature chakra, you can\u2019t control how fast you take it in, so if you have a small chakra reserve of your own you have far less time before the nature energy surpasses the physical and spiritual energies. Naruto has huge chakra reserves but he was turning into a toad in seconds of taking in nature energy when he first started to learn, so someone like Kakashi might just instantly turn to stone as soon as they start absorbing nature energy because they can\u2019t slow the intake.",

In part 1, we literally see Kakashi (funnily enough) training with the intent to increase his chakra, so we know it is possible. Chakra is explained to us at the beginning to be a mix of physical and spiritual energy, and Kakashi was training his physical.\n\nAnyway, by shippuden, the only ninja in Konoha more physically fit than Kakashi is Might Guy himself, yet his chakra pools are still lower than you'd expect. Surely the sharingan can't be draining all of it? \n\nThis is a little headcanon here that I use to explain it for myself, you can ignore it if you want. I think after he met his father in purgatory, Kakashi released a mental block he had for the past decade, and that is what allowed his spiritual energy to be utilised properly, so his chakra basically doubled since it's based on both physical and spiritual. I think a similar thing also happened after he got Obito's forgiveness and lost the DMS. \n\nThat is all headcanon and not confirmed though, but what we do know, his chakra *did* massively increase, or his war arc feats couldn't make sense.\n\nAs for sage mode, Minato attained perfect sage mode in what we assume is around a couple years, Naruto did so in a matter of months. Kakashi and Minato are very close in intelligence, and post shippuden Kakashi has better chakra control and more chakra (I made another comment below the parent of this one explaining the fear that proves so), so he should also be able to learn sage mode in a similar timespan that Minato did.\n\nAlso about your last point, after absorbing it into the Hashirama cells on his face, Madara actually did learn to balance sage mode with his own chakra (he said something along the lines of \"so this is the legendary sage chakra, and here I thought it would be more difficult to control\"). Also if he didn't learn to balance sage chakra he would have lost his mind after absorbing the Juubi.\n\n\nHonestly, Boruto era, the people who should have mastered should be: All of team 7 (Naruto has, Sasuke has shown an affinity to it multiple times, Kakashi could learn a form of it, and there is probably some slug sage Sakura could find out about), and for plot reasons only, Konohamaru.",

He surrounds the entire Hidden leaf village with a quartz wall, for over 24 hours. Just to break down how insane this is:\n\nQuartz wall is a jutsu that was theoretical, but unanimously agreed to be 100% impossible to preform, since nobody could ever have the amount of chakra control and precision to make it work. Despite that, Kakashi actually invented it and uses it in combat. The very creation of this jutsu shows his chakra control is 6 path level.\n\nQuartz wall could be simplified as being the ultimate form of mud wall (this is kinda doing it a disservice). No shinobi in history has ever held a mud wall for over 12 hours, or been able to cover an entire city with it. To do both at the same time is a little incomprehensible. And this isn't a mud wall, it's a jutsu that should already be impossible to preform.\n\nSo basically he covered all of konoha with a nearly unbreakable wall for over a whole day using only his own chakra reserves. We've only seen 1 feat similar to this, and that's when Gara, with Shukaku inside him, covered only the ceiling of the hidden sand, which is much smaller than the hidden leaf, for a few seconds, with a jutsu that he had already been practising his entire life and was first nature to him. If you compare the two feats, it shows just how insane Kakashi's chakra has become post shippuden.",

                            "body": "I understand what you are saying. However the high market value of Hashirama cells comes from his wood release properties and not sage use. He is also the most famous shinobi of all time, so everyone would want a piece of that. Jugo\u2019s clan has sage abilities that only Orochimaru was able to uncover, study, understand and use. Plus they were such a violent and outlier clan that they were avoided by everyone else. If their abilities (or rather the secret to their abilities) were as well-known no doubt their enzymes would be in as much demand as the byakugan or the sharingan. They are also presumed extinct with the only surviving member in a secret medical facility owned by Orochimaru. \n\nAs to the ability, lots of tiny clans are offshoots of larger clans but still have unique clan-specific abilities. The abilities often skip multiple generations and show up later in the family tree. A good example of this is Kimimaro and his unique technique that came all the way from Kaguya. It\u2019s conceivable that given time he would have created a sub-clan all with that ability. Wood release has not been seen since Hashirama, but there is no reason not to think it will not resurface in the future in the same way Kimimaro\u2019s did, even though the other well-known Senju members didn\u2019t inherit it. \n\nIn summary, perhaps kekkei genkai is the wrong name for this. It\u2019s a \u201ckekkei genkai in progress\u201d, a special ability that starts in an individual but given time, luck and selective breeding (like the Hyuuga and Uchiha for instance) would undoubtedly have the potential to be clan-wide. I believe Jugo\u2019s clan was the result of this. Their violent tendencies isolated them meaning they were unable to intermarry, giving the trait a chance to concentrate and become clan-specific.",

One thousand hands is associated with Buddhism, because of some particular form of Buddha having a thousand hands (there's even a huge and famous statue in china that depicts it; also I'm oversimplifying here), and Buddha himself was a sage.\n\nSo in conclusion, good theory",

Minato could slip in a seal on someone's body with his shadow clone by confronting a fake skirmish. Make it look like he lost and kill his clone. Then when the Shinobi returns to his village, he's a frigging time bomb. Minato can use him anytime as a portal to get in and out of any hidden village and kill that dude when he's shitting or something by sneaking behind him. Minatos jutsu is so dangerously unpredictable and if you are as clever like minato, you would probably be damn creative in ways to use it.",

I can\u2019t see any reason why someone wouldn\u2019t, for example, learn of sage mode in a book written by a sage which gives great detail on the workings of sage mode, and then through years of self study, be able to use it themselves, provided they don\u2019t fuck up and kill themselves by absorbing too much nature chakra.\n\nEven if Kakashi\u2019s summons could teach him sage mode, he doesn\u2019t have enough of his own chakra to learn it. You need to have a large chakra pool so you can take in enough nature chakra without just drowning yourself in it and dying. I mean Naruto would start transforming into a toad seconds after beginning to absorb nature chakra, if he didn\u2019t have such a massive chakra pool of his own that he needed to match the nature chakra to, he would\u2019ve turned to a toad even quicker and easier.",

The problem is when you first learn to take in nature chakra, you can\u2019t control how fast you take it in, so if you have a small chakra reserve of your own you have far less time before the nature energy surpasses the physical and spiritual energies. Naruto has huge chakra reserves but he was turning into a toad in seconds of taking in nature energy when he first started to learn, so someone like Kakashi might just instantly turn to stone as soon as they start absorbing nature energy because they can\u2019t slow the intake.",

No matter what he\u2019s always going to be a novice at Senjutsu when he begins training in it, and with his small chakra pool he would quickly die. \n\nAlso again trying to master sage mode usually takes decades even for talented ninja, I mean Jiraiya was a Sannin and trained in it from the age of like 10 and he never fully mastered it even into his 50s.\n\nMadara didn\u2019t learn sage mode, he just stole the sage chakra from Hashirama, that\u2019s why he had to absorb it into the Hashirama face on his chest, because he couldn\u2019t actually balance it with his own chakra properly so it would be too dangerous to just absorb, like we saw when pain tried to absorb Naruto\u2019s chakra and got turned to stone.",

In part 1, we literally see Kakashi (funnily enough) training with the intent to increase his chakra, so we know it is possible. Chakra is explained to us at the beginning to be a mix of physical and spiritual energy, and Kakashi was training his physical.\n\nAnyway, by shippuden, the only ninja in Konoha more physically fit than Kakashi is Might Guy himself, yet his chakra pools are still lower than you'd expect. Surely the sharingan can't be draining all of it? \n\nThis is a little headcanon here that I use to explain it for myself, you can ignore it if you want. I think after he met his father in purgatory, Kakashi released a mental block he had for the past decade, and that is what allowed his spiritual energy to be utilised properly, so his chakra basically doubled since it's based on both physical and spiritual. I think a similar thing also happened after he got Obito's forgiveness and lost the DMS. \n\nThat is all headcanon and not confirmed though, but what we do know, his chakra *did* massively increase, or his war arc feats couldn't make sense.\n\nAs for sage mode, Minato attained perfect sage mode in what we assume is around a couple years, Naruto did so in a matter of months. Kakashi and Minato are very close in intelligence, and post shippuden Kakashi has better chakra control and more chakra (I made another comment below the parent of this one explaining the fear that proves so), so he should also be able to learn sage mode in a similar timespan that Minato did.\n\nAlso about your last point, after absorbing it into the Hashirama cells on his face, Madara actually did learn to balance sage mode with his own chakra (he said something along the lines of \"so this is the legendary sage chakra, and here I thought it would be more difficult to control\"). Also if he didn't learn to balance sage chakra he would have lost his mind after absorbing the Juubi.\n\n\nHonestly, Boruto era, the people who should have mastered should be: All of team 7 (Naruto has, Sasuke has shown an affinity to it multiple times, Kakashi could learn a form of it, and there is probably some slug sage Sakura could find out about), and for plot reasons only, Konohamaru.",

He surrounds the entire Hidden leaf village with a quartz wall, for over 24 hours. Just to break down how insane this is:\n\nQuartz wall is a jutsu that was theoretical, but unanimously agreed to be 100% impossible to preform, since nobody could ever have the amount of chakra control and precision to make it work. Despite that, Kakashi actually invented it and uses it in combat. The very creation of this jutsu shows his chakra control is 6 path level.\n\nQuartz wall could be simplified as being the ultimate form of mud wall (this is kinda doing it a disservice). No shinobi in history has ever held a mud wall for over 12 hours, or been able to cover an entire city with it. To do both at the same time is a little incomprehensible. And this isn't a mud wall, it's a jutsu that should already be impossible to preform.\n\nSo basically he covered all of konoha with a nearly unbreakable wall for over a whole day using only his own chakra reserves. We've only seen 1 feat similar to this, and that's when Gara, with Shukaku inside him, covered only the ceiling of the hidden sand, which is much smaller than the hidden leaf, for a few seconds, with a jutsu that he had already been practising his entire life and was first nature to him. If you compare the two feats, it shows just how insane Kakashi's chakra has become post shippuden.",

                    "body": "I understand what you are saying. However the high market value of Hashirama cells comes from his wood release properties and not sage use. He is also the most famous shinobi of all time, so everyone would want a piece of that. Jugo\u2019s clan has sage abilities that only Orochimaru was able to uncover, study, understand and use. Plus they were such a violent and outlier clan that they were avoided by everyone else. If their abilities (or rather the secret to their abilities) were as well-known no doubt their enzymes would be in as much demand as the byakugan or the sharingan. They are also presumed extinct with the only surviving member in a secret medical facility owned by Orochimaru. \n\nAs to the ability, lots of tiny clans are offshoots of larger clans but still have unique clan-specific abilities. The abilities often skip multiple generations and show up later in the family tree. A good example of this is Kimimaro and his unique technique that came all the way from Kaguya. It\u2019s conceivable that given time he would have created a sub-clan all with that ability. Wood release has not been seen since Hashirama, but there is no reason not to think it will not resurface in the future in the same way Kimimaro\u2019s did, even though the other well-known Senju members didn\u2019t inherit it. \n\nIn summary, perhaps kekkei genkai is the wrong name for this. It\u2019s a \u201ckekkei genkai in progress\u201d, a special ability that starts in an individual but given time, luck and selective breeding (like the Hyuuga and Uchiha for instance) would undoubtedly have the potential to be clan-wide. I believe Jugo\u2019s clan was the result of this. Their violent tendencies isolated them meaning they were unable to intermarry, giving the trait a chance to concentrate and become clan-specific.",

Minato could slip in a seal on someone's body with his shadow clone by confronting a fake skirmish. Make it look like he lost and kill his clone. Then when the Shinobi returns to his village, he's a frigging time bomb. Minato can use him anytime as a portal to get in and out of any hidden village and kill that dude when he's shitting or something by sneaking behind him. Minatos jutsu is so dangerously unpredictable and if you are as clever like minato, you would probably be damn creative in ways to use it.",

I can\u2019t see any reason why someone wouldn\u2019t, for example, learn of sage mode in a book written by a sage which gives great detail on the workings of sage mode, and then through years of self study, be able to use it themselves, provided they don\u2019t fuck up and kill themselves by absorbing too much nature chakra.\n\nEven if Kakashi\u2019s summons could teach him sage mode, he doesn\u2019t have enough of his own chakra to learn it. You need to have a large chakra pool so you can take in enough nature chakra without just drowning yourself in it and dying. I mean Naruto would start transforming into a toad seconds after beginning to absorb nature chakra, if he didn\u2019t have such a massive chakra pool of his own that he needed to match the nature chakra to, he would\u2019ve turned to a toad even quicker and easier.",

In part 1, we literally see Kakashi (funnily enough) training with the intent to increase his chakra, so we know it is possible. Chakra is explained to us at the beginning to be a mix of physical and spiritual energy, and Kakashi was training his physical.\n\nAnyway, by shippuden, the only ninja in Konoha more physically fit than Kakashi is Might Guy himself, yet his chakra pools are still lower than you'd expect. Surely the sharingan can't be draining all of it? \n\nThis is a little headcanon here that I use to explain it for myself, you can ignore it if you want. I think after he met his father in purgatory, Kakashi released a mental block he had for the past decade, and that is what allowed his spiritual energy to be utilised properly, so his chakra basically doubled since it's based on both physical and spiritual. I think a similar thing also happened after he got Obito's forgiveness and lost the DMS. \n\nThat is all headcanon and not confirmed though, but what we do know, his chakra *did* massively increase, or his war arc feats couldn't make sense.\n\nAs for sage mode, Minato attained perfect sage mode in what we assume is around a couple years, Naruto did so in a matter of months. Kakashi and Minato are very close in intelligence, and post shippuden Kakashi has better chakra control and more chakra (I made another comment below the parent of this one explaining the fear that proves so), so he should also be able to learn sage mode in a similar timespan that Minato did.\n\nAlso about your last point, after absorbing it into the Hashirama cells on his face, Madara actually did learn to balance sage mode with his own chakra (he said something along the lines of \"so this is the legendary sage chakra, and here I thought it would be more difficult to control\"). Also if he didn't learn to balance sage chakra he would have lost his mind after absorbing the Juubi.\n\n\nHonestly, Boruto era, the people who should have mastered should be: All of team 7 (Naruto has, Sasuke has shown an affinity to it multiple times, Kakashi could learn a form of it, and there is probably some slug sage Sakura could find out about), and for plot reasons only, Konohamaru.",

Just to break down how insane this is:\n\nQuartz wall is a jutsu that was theoretical, but unanimously agreed to be 100% impossible to preform, since nobody could ever have the amount of chakra control and precision to make it work. Despite that, Kakashi actually invented it and uses it in combat. The very creation of this jutsu shows his chakra control is 6 path level.\n\nQuartz wall could be simplified as being the ultimate form of mud wall (this is kinda doing it a disservice). No shinobi in history has ever held a mud wall for over 12 hours, or been able to cover an entire city with it. To do both at the same time is a little incomprehensible. And this isn't a mud wall, it's a jutsu that should already be impossible to preform.\n\nSo basically he covered all of konoha with a nearly unbreakable wall for over a whole day using only his own chakra reserves. We've only seen 1 feat similar to this, and that's when Gara, with Shukaku inside him, covered only the ceiling of the hidden sand, which is much smaller than the hidden leaf, for a few seconds, with a jutsu that he had already been practising his entire life and was first nature to him. If you compare the two feats, it shows just how insane Kakashi's chakra has become post shippuden.",

Also he doesn't turn the whole mudwall into quartz he can just reinforce specific areas against attack.  \n\nStill an impressive feat but hardly evidence of Bijuu level chakra or 6 paths calibre anything. Kakashi has shown a penchant for mastering and then improving on techniques, which is what he did here.",

He is also the most famous shinobi of all time, so everyone would want a piece of that. Jugo\u2019s clan has sage abilities that only Orochimaru was able to uncover, study, understand and use. Plus they were such a violent and outlier clan that they were avoided by everyone else. If their abilities (or rather the secret to their abilities) were as well-known no doubt their enzymes would be in as much demand as the byakugan or the sharingan. They are also presumed extinct with the only surviving member in a secret medical facility owned by Orochimaru. \n\nAs to the ability, lots of tiny clans are offshoots of larger clans but still have unique clan-specific abilities. The abilities often skip multiple generations and show up later in the family tree. A good example of this is Kimimaro and his unique technique that came all the way from Kaguya. It\u2019s conceivable that given time he would have created a sub-clan all with that ability. Wood release has not been seen since Hashirama, but there is no reason not to think it will not resurface in the future in the same way Kimimaro\u2019s did, even though the other well-known Senju members didn\u2019t inherit it. \n\nIn summary, perhaps kekkei genkai is the wrong name for this. It\u2019s a \u201ckekkei genkai in progress\u201d, a special ability that starts in an individual but given time, luck and selective breeding (like the Hyuuga and Uchiha for instance) would undoubtedly have the potential to be clan-wide. I believe Jugo\u2019s clan was the result of this. Their violent tendencies isolated them meaning they were unable to intermarry, giving the trait a chance to concentrate and become clan-specific.",

Minato can use him anytime as a portal to get in and out of any hidden village and kill that dude when he's shitting or something by sneaking behind him. Minatos jutsu is so dangerously unpredictable and if you are as clever like minato, you would probably be damn creative in ways to use it.",

You can\u2019t just increase your chakra like that, but you can train yourself so that your Jutsu use less chakra.\n\nKakashi gets no chakra boost post shippuden, like I said you don\u2019t just grow more chakra, you just get better at using it. No matter what he\u2019s always going to be a novice at Senjutsu when he begins training in it, and with his small chakra pool he would quickly die. \n\nAlso again trying to master sage mode usually takes decades even for talented ninja, I mean Jiraiya was a Sannin and trained in it from the age of like 10 and he never fully mastered it even into his 50s.\n\nMadara didn\u2019t learn sage mode, he just stole the sage chakra from Hashirama, that\u2019s why he had to absorb it into the Hashirama face on his chest, because he couldn\u2019t actually balance it with his own chakra properly so it would be too dangerous to just absorb, like we saw when pain tried to absorb Naruto\u2019s chakra and got turned to stone.",

                            "body": "both your top 2 points have been disproven already. In part 1, we literally see Kakashi (funnily enough) training with the intent to increase his chakra, so we know it is possible. Chakra is explained to us at the beginning to be a mix of physical and spiritual energy, and Kakashi was training his physical.\n\nAnyway, by shippuden, the only ninja in Konoha more physically fit than Kakashi is Might Guy himself, yet his chakra pools are still lower than you'd expect. Surely the sharingan can't be draining all of it? \n\nThis is a little headcanon here that I use to explain it for myself, you can ignore it if you want. I think after he met his father in purgatory, Kakashi released a mental block he had for the past decade, and that is what allowed his spiritual energy to be utilised properly, so his chakra basically doubled since it's based on both physical and spiritual. I think a similar thing also happened after he got Obito's forgiveness and lost the DMS. \n\nThat is all headcanon and not confirmed though, but what we do know, his chakra *did* massively increase, or his war arc feats couldn't make sense.\n\nAs for sage mode, Minato attained perfect sage mode in what we assume is around a couple years, Naruto did so in a matter of months. Kakashi and Minato are very close in intelligence, and post shippuden Kakashi has better chakra control and more chakra (I made another comment below the parent of this one explaining the fear that proves so), so he should also be able to learn sage mode in a similar timespan that Minato did.\n\nAlso about your last point, after absorbing it into the Hashirama cells on his face, Madara actually did learn to balance sage mode with his own chakra (he said something along the lines of \"so this is the legendary sage chakra, and here I thought it would be more difficult to control\"). Also if he didn't learn to balance sage chakra he would have lost his mind after absorbing the Juubi.\n\n\nHonestly, Boruto era, the people who should have mastered should be: All of team 7 (Naruto has, Sasuke has shown an affinity to it multiple times, Kakashi could learn a form of it, and there is probably some slug sage Sakura could find out about), and for plot reasons only, Konohamaru.",

Just to break down how insane this is:\n\nQuartz wall is a jutsu that was theoretical, but unanimously agreed to be 100% impossible to preform, since nobody could ever have the amount of chakra control and precision to make it work. Despite that, Kakashi actually invented it and uses it in combat. The very creation of this jutsu shows his chakra control is 6 path level.\n\nQuartz wall could be simplified as being the ultimate form of mud wall (this is kinda doing it a disservice). No shinobi in history has ever held a mud wall for over 12 hours, or been able to cover an entire city with it. To do both at the same time is a little incomprehensible. And this isn't a mud wall, it's a jutsu that should already be impossible to preform.\n\nSo basically he covered all of konoha with a nearly unbreakable wall for over a whole day using only his own chakra reserves. We've only seen 1 feat similar to this, and that's when Gara, with Shukaku inside him, covered only the ceiling of the hidden sand, which is much smaller than the hidden leaf, for a few seconds, with a jutsu that he had already been practising his entire life and was first nature to him. If you compare the two feats, it shows just how insane Kakashi's chakra has become post shippuden.",

Minato can use him anytime as a portal to get in and out of any hidden village and kill that dude when he's shitting or something by sneaking behind him. Minatos jutsu is so dangerously unpredictable and if you are as clever like minato, you would probably be damn creative in ways to use it.",

You can\u2019t just increase your chakra like that, but you can train yourself so that your Jutsu use less chakra.\n\nKakashi gets no chakra boost post shippuden, like I said you don\u2019t just grow more chakra, you just get better at using it. No matter what he\u2019s always going to be a novice at Senjutsu when he begins training in it, and with his small chakra pool he would quickly die. \n\nAlso again trying to master sage mode usually takes decades even for talented ninja, I mean Jiraiya was a Sannin and trained in it from the age of like 10 and he never fully mastered it even into his 50s.\n\nMadara didn\u2019t learn sage mode, he just stole the sage chakra from Hashirama, that\u2019s why he had to absorb it into the Hashirama face on his chest, because he couldn\u2019t actually balance it with his own chakra properly so it would be too dangerous to just absorb, like we saw when pain tried to absorb Naruto\u2019s chakra and got turned to stone.",

                    "body": "both your top 2 points have been disproven already. In part 1, we literally see Kakashi (funnily enough) training with the intent to increase his chakra, so we know it is possible. Chakra is explained to us at the beginning to be a mix of physical and spiritual energy, and Kakashi was training his physical.\n\nAnyway, by shippuden, the only ninja in Konoha more physically fit than Kakashi is Might Guy himself, yet his chakra pools are still lower than you'd expect. Surely the sharingan can't be draining all of it? \n\nThis is a little headcanon here that I use to explain it for myself, you can ignore it if you want. I think after he met his father in purgatory, Kakashi released a mental block he had for the past decade, and that is what allowed his spiritual energy to be utilised properly, so his chakra basically doubled since it's based on both physical and spiritual. I think a similar thing also happened after he got Obito's forgiveness and lost the DMS. \n\nThat is all headcanon and not confirmed though, but what we do know, his chakra *did* massively increase, or his war arc feats couldn't make sense.\n\nAs for sage mode, Minato attained perfect sage mode in what we assume is around a couple years, Naruto did so in a matter of months. Kakashi and Minato are very close in intelligence, and post shippuden Kakashi has better chakra control and more chakra (I made another comment below the parent of this one explaining the fear that proves so), so he should also be able to learn sage mode in a similar timespan that Minato did.\n\nAlso about your last point, after absorbing it into the Hashirama cells on his face, Madara actually did learn to balance sage mode with his own chakra (he said something along the lines of \"so this is the legendary sage chakra, and here I thought it would be more difficult to control\"). Also if he didn't learn to balance sage chakra he would have lost his mind after absorbing the Juubi.\n\n\nHonestly, Boruto era, the people who should have mastered should be: All of team 7 (Naruto has, Sasuke has shown an affinity to it multiple times, Kakashi could learn a form of it, and there is probably some slug sage Sakura could find out about), and for plot reasons only, Konohamaru.",

                    "body": "In the novels (canon), Kakashi Retsuden, he pulls off a certain feat. He surrounds the entire Hidden leaf village with a quartz wall, for over 24 hours. Just to break down how insane this is:\n\nQuartz wall is a jutsu that was theoretical, but unanimously agreed to be 100% impossible to preform, since nobody could ever have the amount of chakra control and precision to make it work. Despite that, Kakashi actually invented it and uses it in combat. The very creation of this jutsu shows his chakra control is 6 path level.\n\nQuartz wall could be simplified as being the ultimate form of mud wall (this is kinda doing it a disservice). No shinobi in history has ever held a mud wall for over 12 hours, or been able to cover an entire city with it. To do both at the same time is a little incomprehensible. And this isn't a mud wall, it's a jutsu that should already be impossible to preform.\n\nSo basically he covered all of konoha with a nearly unbreakable wall for over a whole day using only his own chakra reserves. We've only seen 1 feat similar to this, and that's when Gara, with Shukaku inside him, covered only the ceiling of the hidden sand, which is much smaller than the hidden leaf, for a few seconds, with a jutsu that he had already been practising his entire life and was first nature to him. If you compare the two feats, it shows just how insane Kakashi's chakra has become post shippuden.",

He flexed so hard by just straight up ignoring Ay's Lightning Cloak. He blitzed right to Bee and Ay had to give up or sacrifice the most important person to him. Minato is the true GOAT.",

Minato can use him anytime as a portal to get in and out of any hidden village and kill that dude when he's shitting or something by sneaking behind him. Minatos jutsu is so dangerously unpredictable and if you are as clever like minato, you would probably be damn creative in ways to use it.",

            "body": "both your top 2 points have been disproven already. In part 1, we literally see Kakashi (funnily enough) training with the intent to increase his chakra, so we know it is possible. Chakra is explained to us at the beginning to be a mix of physical and spiritual energy, and Kakashi was training his physical.\n\nAnyway, by shippuden, the only ninja in Konoha more physically fit than Kakashi is Might Guy himself, yet his chakra pools are still lower than you'd expect. Surely the sharingan can't be draining all of it? \n\nThis is a little headcanon here that I use to explain it for myself, you can ignore it if you want. I think after he met his father in purgatory, Kakashi released a mental block he had for the past decade, and that is what allowed his spiritual energy to be utilised properly, so his chakra basically doubled since it's based on both physical and spiritual. I think a similar thing also happened after he got Obito's forgiveness and lost the DMS. \n\nThat is all headcanon and not confirmed though, but what we do know, his chakra *did* massively increase, or his war arc feats couldn't make sense.\n\nAs for sage mode, Minato attained perfect sage mode in what we assume is around a couple years, Naruto did so in a matter of months. Kakashi and Minato are very close in intelligence, and post shippuden Kakashi has better chakra control and more chakra (I made another comment below the parent of this one explaining the fear that proves so), so he should also be able to learn sage mode in a similar timespan that Minato did.\n\nAlso about your last point, after absorbing it into the Hashirama cells on his face, Madara actually did learn to balance sage mode with his own chakra (he said something along the lines of \"so this is the legendary sage chakra, and here I thought it would be more difficult to control\"). Also if he didn't learn to balance sage chakra he would have lost his mind after absorbing the Juubi.\n\n\nHonestly, Boruto era, the people who should have mastered should be: All of team 7 (Naruto has, Sasuke has shown an affinity to it multiple times, Kakashi could learn a form of it, and there is probably some slug sage Sakura could find out about), and for plot reasons only, Konohamaru.",

            "body": "In the novels (canon), Kakashi Retsuden, he pulls off a certain feat. He surrounds the entire Hidden leaf village with a quartz wall, for over 24 hours. Just to break down how insane this is:\n\nQuartz wall is a jutsu that was theoretical, but unanimously agreed to be 100% impossible to preform, since nobody could ever have the amount of chakra control and precision to make it work. Despite that, Kakashi actually invented it and uses it in combat. The very creation of this jutsu shows his chakra control is 6 path level.\n\nQuartz wall could be simplified as being the ultimate form of mud wall (this is kinda doing it a disservice). No shinobi in history has ever held a mud wall for over 12 hours, or been able to cover an entire city with it. To do both at the same time is a little incomprehensible. And this isn't a mud wall, it's a jutsu that should already be impossible to preform.\n\nSo basically he covered all of konoha with a nearly unbreakable wall for over a whole day using only his own chakra reserves. We've only seen 1 feat similar to this, and that's when Gara, with Shukaku inside him, covered only the ceiling of the hidden sand, which is much smaller than the hidden leaf, for a few seconds, with a jutsu that he had already been practising his entire life and was first nature to him. If you compare the two feats, it shows just how insane Kakashi's chakra has become post shippuden.",

He flexed so hard by just straight up ignoring Ay's Lightning Cloak. He blitzed right to Bee and Ay had to give up or sacrifice the most important person to him. Minato is the true GOAT.",
