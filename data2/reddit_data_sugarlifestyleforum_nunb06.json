    "body": "So I just found out today that an SD I see died unexpectedly about a week ago. I literally saw him a few days before and we had a nice time together, and then he was texting me a few days after saying he wasn\u2019t feeling well. His doctor was telling him to go to the hospital, and I was encouraging him to do so, but I don\u2019t know if he went or not because I never heard back from him after that. \nHis obituary says he died two days after I received his last text. I\u2019ve been texting him almost every day all week wishing him well and hoping he was getting better. We had plans today and I wanted to firm those up. Something just felt off and I\u2019ve been ghosted before, but he was not the type of guy to do that. So I googled his name today just out of curiosity and found out. It\u2019s very sad :(. \nI guess my question is what are the protocols for this sort of situation? He had a cat that he loved, and I want to make sure it\u2019s taken care of, but the very last thing I want to do is insert myself and cause drama or anything at all for his family and friends. His family is very, very religious and I\u2019m almost certain they don\u2019t know anything about me or what he was doing. He lived alone, but I\u2019m pretty sure his neighbors knew about me, but still, I\u2019m thinking that even though I want to see if the cat is okay, it\u2019s probably not my place to. \nHave any other SBs gone through this experience before? How did you deal with it? I didn\u2019t have romantic feelings for him, but I really enjoyed his company and friendship and am really sad over this happening so unexpectedly and suddenly. Thank you to everyone in advance for any advice you have to offer. I appreciate it!",

At first I thought he maybe just was done with me and ghosted me but eventually I drove past his house and noticed it was vacant, inquired with a neighbor and was told he died. Couldn\u2019t even find an obituary since I didn\u2019t know his full name for privacy reasons anyways. It is really sad but there\u2019s not much we can do if we hope to maintain their confidentiality, even when I asked the neighbor I tried to be discreet about it. Sorry you had to go through this as well",

He'd changed the plans to tentative because he hadn't been feeling well and was thinking of staying home. When you didn't hear from him you feared the worst and are sad to find out that it's true. Extend your condolences, and then apologize if it seems inappropriate but you weren't sure if you should or how to reach out to family. Explain that you wanted to offer to adopt the cat if no one in the family was able to take on the responsibility. \n\nIf anyone suspiciously asks what plans he had, just say you never asked for personal details, it was just one of many pet sitting gigs you accept in the area. Your concern is that if he was hiring a pet sitter there may be no one to take care of the cat now.",

Extend your condolences, and then apologize if it seems inappropriate but you weren't sure if you should or how to reach out to family. Explain that you wanted to offer to adopt the cat if no one in the family was able to take on the responsibility. \n\nIf anyone suspiciously asks what plans he had, just say you never asked for personal details, it was just one of many pet sitting gigs you accept in the area. Your concern is that if he was hiring a pet sitter there may be no one to take care of the cat now.",
