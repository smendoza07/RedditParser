Don't let it get to you.  Realize that in most cases - they aren't stupid.  They are just trying to manipulate you.

There are some out there that just want to date a guy that has a better lifestyle then guys her age.  My girl we wound up bonding over her interest in becoming a real estate agent, something that I have a lot of experience with since I invest in real estate.  So I am helping her get her license and introducing her to people in the business so she can get a job.\n\nI guess in a way that does make it a sugar relationship since I am mentoring her but we have never done any kind of allowance.  I do occasionally buy her things I know she needs but she has never asked me for anything.  I just like to surprise her.",

Most women on those website are not there for sex or to find someone who looks good. That's not our priority, i personally couldn't care less and I know for a fact that most women there don't care as well. Let's be real for a moment...for women the main factor is MONEY, for men it is SEX. \n\n  \nTreat me nice and I treat you even better. My looks might get your attention but I gotta bring something to the table to deserve whatever you are going to offer me. Shocking is that many of these very young girls (older ones as well) don't add any value to that man's life other than looking cute but expect the world from him, just doesn't make sense. It's an exchange...always has been and always will be. If the woman want's money or whatever from him, she gotta figure out how to make him happy in order to receive (his hard earned money) other than just being pretty. \n\n  \nI personally prefer dating older SDs, simply because they are not so arrogant and full of sh\\*\\*, sorry but it's the truth. They usually don't want to fuck you for hours like a rabbit in some hotel room throw the money on the counter and leave...I mean yes, they want sex, but they actually put effort in this and wine and dine you, create experiences together, get to know you...AND they are more generous. Some even spoil you rotten if you are extravagant with them.   \nI actually avoid the younger ones (under 40) and I receive so many messages from men younger than me. So weird.\n\n  \nPS...as a comment to some of the responses. There are way more reasons why women become SBs and the least is because they are sex addicts lol. That's just ridiculous, that's not even what drives us. I know women (me included) who have a career and actually make a pretty decent living for themselves, but they like the whole dynamic of an arrangement and also know what they bring to the table. So the money is a very nice bonus that makes more things possible. Others seek support for whatever circumstance and then there are the lazy ones (be aware of those). \n\n  \nIn the end it all comes down to the right communication, know what you want, know what you can and want to provide and communicate it openly. Be respectful, be straight forward and don't waste each others time. xoxo Aurora",

I am definitely not every ones cup of tea, some sbs have goals that require large sums of money.

Most are not going to get what attractive sbs get. Some might, but most won't find an sd or get the same amount. Looks matter, on both sides. It's not the same rules for everyone playing, sd or sb.

If I was just looking for sex and dinner I'd be fucking like the energizer bunny all over my city\n\nBut let's put out a different scenario.  And for reference - let's call your attraction to a guy from Bumble a \"10\" to anchor this discussion.\n\nWould you choose to meet up with a younger guy that you find somewhat physically attractive (say, a 6), who can provide an allowance of X.  Or would you choose to meet with an older guy, that you find more like a 3, who could provide 1.5X ?  \n\nThere is no right or wrong answer here.  The 10 gives you nothing.  The 6 will give you X.  The 3 will give you 1.5X.  Which do you choose?  Or do you choose all? :).\n\nThe thing is - a legit SD is never going to say \"discount\".  They are simply going to say, this is what I'm able to provide.  And if the number doesn't work for you - they aren't going to neg you.",

This was on Secret Benefits where they exclusively refer to you as a SB or SD upon signing up. So someone thinking they can manipulate me into escort services is pretty offensive. Also, if I have a set price that meets my personal needs, it is offensive to be told that I need to be open to negotiation. \n\nIf someone doesn't agree to my offer or vice versa, that's fine.

Don't let it get to you.  Realize that in most cases - they aren't stupid.  They are just trying to manipulate you.

There are some out there that just want to date a guy that has a better lifestyle then guys her age.  My girl we wound up bonding over her interest in becoming a real estate agent, something that I have a lot of experience with since I invest in real estate.  So I am helping her get her license and introducing her to people in the business so she can get a job.\n\nI guess in a way that does make it a sugar relationship since I am mentoring her but we have never done any kind of allowance.  I do occasionally buy her things I know she needs but she has never asked me for anything.  I just like to surprise her.",

If I was just looking for sex and dinner I'd be fucking like the energizer bunny all over my city\n\nBut let's put out a different scenario.  And for reference - let's call your attraction to a guy from Bumble a \"10\" to anchor this discussion.\n\nWould you choose to meet up with a younger guy that you find somewhat physically attractive (say, a 6), who can provide an allowance of X.  Or would you choose to meet with an older guy, that you find more like a 3, who could provide 1.5X ?  \n\nThere is no right or wrong answer here.  The 10 gives you nothing.  The 6 will give you X.  The 3 will give you 1.5X.  Which do you choose?  Or do you choose all? :).\n\nThe thing is - a legit SD is never going to say \"discount\".  They are simply going to say, this is what I'm able to provide.  And if the number doesn't work for you - they aren't going to neg you.",

This was on Secret Benefits where they exclusively refer to you as a SB or SD upon signing up. So someone thinking they can manipulate me into escort services is pretty offensive. Also, if I have a set price that meets my personal needs, it is offensive to be told that I need to be open to negotiation. \n\nIf someone doesn't agree to my offer or vice versa, that's fine. I simply end the conversation. But the manipulation warrants my unfiltered feedback.",

There are some out there that just want to date a guy that has a better lifestyle then guys her age.  My girl we wound up bonding over her interest in becoming a real estate agent, something that I have a lot of experience with since I invest in real estate.  So I am helping her get her license and introducing her to people in the business so she can get a job.\n\nI guess in a way that does make it a sugar relationship since I am mentoring her but we have never done any kind of allowance.  I do occasionally buy her things I know she needs but she has never asked me for anything.  I just like to surprise her.",

If I was just looking for sex and dinner I'd be fucking like the energizer bunny all over my city\n\nBut let's put out a different scenario.  And for reference - let's call your attraction to a guy from Bumble a \"10\" to anchor this discussion.\n\nWould you choose to meet up with a younger guy that you find somewhat physically attractive (say, a 6), who can provide an allowance of X.  Or would you choose to meet with an older guy, that you find more like a 3, who could provide 1.5X ?  \n\nThere is no right or wrong answer here.  The 10 gives you nothing.  The 6 will give you X.  The 3 will give you 1.5X.  Which do you choose?  Or do you choose all? :).\n\nThe thing is - a legit SD is never going to say \"discount\".  They are simply going to say, this is what I'm able to provide.  And if the number doesn't work for you - they aren't going to neg you.",

There are some out there that just want to date a guy that has a better lifestyle then guys her age.  My girl we wound up bonding over her interest in becoming a real estate agent, something that I have a lot of experience with since I invest in real estate.  So I am helping her get her license and introducing her to people in the business so she can get a job.\n\nI guess in a way that does make it a sugar relationship since I am mentoring her but we have never done any kind of allowance.  I do occasionally buy her things I know she needs but she has never asked me for anything.  I just like to surprise her.",

If I was just looking for sex and dinner I'd be fucking like the energizer bunny all over my city\n\nBut let's put out a different scenario.  And for reference - let's call your attraction to a guy from Bumble a \"10\" to anchor this discussion.\n\nWould you choose to meet up with a younger guy that you find somewhat physically attractive (say, a 6), who can provide an allowance of X.  Or would you choose to meet with an older guy, that you find more like a 3, who could provide 1.5X ?  \n\nThere is no right or wrong answer here.  The 10 gives you nothing.  The 6 will give you X.  The 3 will give you 1.5X.  Which do you choose?  Or do you choose all? :).\n\nThe thing is - a legit SD is never going to say \"discount\".  They are simply going to say, this is what I'm able to provide.  And if the number doesn't work for you - they aren't going to neg you.",

If I was just looking for sex and dinner I'd be fucking like the energizer bunny all over my city\n\nBut let's put out a different scenario.  And for reference - let's call your attraction to a guy from Bumble a \"10\" to anchor this discussion.\n\nWould you choose to meet up with a younger guy that you find somewhat physically attractive (say, a 6), who can provide an allowance of X.  Or would you choose to meet with an older guy, that you find more like a 3, who could provide 1.5X ?  \n\nThere is no right or wrong answer here.  The 10 gives you nothing.  The 6 will give you X.  The 3 will give you 1.5X.  Which do you choose?  Or do you choose all? :).\n\nThe thing is - a legit SD is never going to say \"discount\".  They are simply going to say, this is what I'm able to provide.  And if the number doesn't work for you - they aren't going to neg you.",
