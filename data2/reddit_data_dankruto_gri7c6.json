That their skills came from doing missions?\n\nIt's inferred from 2 things: 1-we never see Kakashi train them with anything relevant to the feats 2-Kakashi acts surprised when he sees Naruto and Sakura perform in their exam matches with Kiba and ino. If he had been there to train them, he would have known where their feats came from, therefore he wouldn't have acted so shocked. \n\n>Because Kurenai and Asuma's teams did the same thing and yet the supposedly weaker students from Kakashi's team were able to match them. \n\nBecause they trained in their own time privately or, in Naruto's case, with Ebisu. \n\n>You can't gain combat skills from missions when you only foght one time during a mission.\n\nYou can, it's combat experience and thus it develops skill. \n\n>Also Kakashi not training them on screen doesn't mean he didn't teach them other stuff off screen. Not all training is shown on screen since that would be unnecessary and boring.\n\nYes, but the characters usually tell you when they train. The show tells us about every instance when someone trains be it by themselves or with someone. I find it odd that it would forget to tell us in this one singular instance. \n\n>Jiraiya taught Naruto chakra control for what? He still needed clones to make rasengan. Had no other jutsu. \n\nFor using his chakra more efficiently and paving the way to master new techniques. The change may not have been drastic but it was still there. \n\n>Got caught in Itachi clones's genjutsu.\n\nThat's Itachi we're talking about. And even though it wasn't really him, Kakashi noted that his jutsu were no different. You're not seriously going to take issue with Jiraiya's training just because he couldn't resist ITACHI. \n\n>Strategically there was no visible Improvments from when he was with Kakshi.\n\nNo? Naruto learned how to ingeniously dodge attacks in mid-air by making his own clone pull him, for example. It's all these small combat techniques and strategies adding up that made the difference. \n\n>Most of the other points seem pretty redundant. He would've learnt how to use how to use shadow clones effeciently by himself. \n\nNo, and Kakashi makes a point of this. During the training for the rasenshuriken, Kakashi points out that Naruto never even realized that he gained any experience his clones gained. So Naruto would also never have realized how to use clones more efficiently by himself as evidenced by his ignorance of that basic fact. \n\n>He could barely control kurama and lost control after 3 tails during the gaara rescue arc\n\nHe could barely control him during **extreme** circumstances. Gaara dying and trying to retrieve Sasuke were extreme emotional triggers for him; no amount of training would've done that any good.",

That their skills came from doing missions?\n\nIt's inferred from 2 things: 1-we never see Kakashi train them with anything relevant to the feats 2-Kakashi acts surprised when he sees Naruto and Sakura perform in their exam matches with Kiba and ino. If he had been there to train them, he would have known where their feats came from, therefore he wouldn't have acted so shocked. \n\n>Because Kurenai and Asuma's teams did the same thing and yet the supposedly weaker students from Kakashi's team were able to match them. \n\nBecause they trained in their own time privately or, in Naruto's case, with Ebisu. \n\n>You can't gain combat skills from missions when you only foght one time during a mission.\n\nYou can, it's combat experience and thus it develops skill. \n\n>Also Kakashi not training them on screen doesn't mean he didn't teach them other stuff off screen. Not all training is shown on screen since that would be unnecessary and boring.\n\nYes, but the characters usually tell you when they train. The show tells us about every instance when someone trains be it by themselves or with someone. I find it odd that it would forget to tell us in this one singular instance. \n\n>Jiraiya taught Naruto chakra control for what? He still needed clones to make rasengan. Had no other jutsu. \n\nFor using his chakra more efficiently and paving the way to master new techniques. The change may not have been drastic but it was still there. \n\n>Got caught in Itachi clones's genjutsu.\n\nThat's Itachi we're talking about. And even though it wasn't really him, Kakashi noted that his jutsu were no different. You're not seriously going to take issue with Jiraiya's training just because he couldn't resist ITACHI. \n\n>Strategically there was no visible Improvments from when he was with Kakshi.\n\nNo? Naruto learned how to ingeniously dodge attacks in mid-air by making his own clone pull him, for example. It's all these small combat techniques and strategies adding up that made the difference. \n\n>Most of the other points seem pretty redundant. He would've learnt how to use how to use shadow clones effeciently by himself. \n\nNo, and Kakashi makes a point of this. During the training for the rasenshuriken, Kakashi points out that Naruto never even realized that he gained any experience his clones gained. So Naruto would also never have realized how to use clones more efficiently by himself as evidenced by his ignorance of that basic fact. \n\n>He could barely control kurama and lost control after 3 tails during the gaara rescue arc\n\nHe could barely control him during **extreme** circumstances. Gaara dying and trying to retrieve Sasuke were extreme emotional triggers for him; no amount of training would've done that any good.",

That their skills came from doing missions?\n\nIt's inferred from 2 things: 1-we never see Kakashi train them with anything relevant to the feats 2-Kakashi acts surprised when he sees Naruto and Sakura perform in their exam matches with Kiba and ino. If he had been there to train them, he would have known where their feats came from, therefore he wouldn't have acted so shocked. \n\n>Because Kurenai and Asuma's teams did the same thing and yet the supposedly weaker students from Kakashi's team were able to match them. \n\nBecause they trained in their own time privately or, in Naruto's case, with Ebisu. \n\n>You can't gain combat skills from missions when you only foght one time during a mission.\n\nYou can, it's combat experience and thus it develops skill. \n\n>Also Kakashi not training them on screen doesn't mean he didn't teach them other stuff off screen. Not all training is shown on screen since that would be unnecessary and boring.\n\nYes, but the characters usually tell you when they train. The show tells us about every instance when someone trains be it by themselves or with someone. I find it odd that it would forget to tell us in this one singular instance. \n\n>Jiraiya taught Naruto chakra control for what? He still needed clones to make rasengan. Had no other jutsu. \n\nFor using his chakra more efficiently and paving the way to master new techniques. The change may not have been drastic but it was still there. \n\n>Got caught in Itachi clones's genjutsu.\n\nThat's Itachi we're talking about. And even though it wasn't really him, Kakashi noted that his jutsu were no different. You're not seriously going to take issue with Jiraiya's training just because he couldn't resist ITACHI. \n\n>Strategically there was no visible Improvments from when he was with Kakshi.\n\nNo? Naruto learned how to ingeniously dodge attacks in mid-air by making his own clone pull him, for example. It's all these small combat techniques and strategies adding up that made the difference. \n\n>Most of the other points seem pretty redundant. He would've learnt how to use how to use shadow clones effeciently by himself. \n\nNo, and Kakashi makes a point of this. During the training for the rasenshuriken, Kakashi points out that Naruto never even realized that he gained any experience his clones gained. So Naruto would also never have realized how to use clones more efficiently by himself as evidenced by his ignorance of that basic fact. \n\n>He could barely control kurama and lost control after 3 tails during the gaara rescue arc\n\nHe could barely control him during **extreme** circumstances. Gaara dying and trying to retrieve Sasuke were extreme emotional triggers for him; no amount of training would've done that any good.",

If he had been there to train them, he would have known where their feats came from, therefore he wouldn't have acted so shocked. \n\n>Because Kurenai and Asuma's teams did the same thing and yet the supposedly weaker students from Kakashi's team were able to match them. \n\nBecause they trained in their own time privately or, in Naruto's case, with Ebisu. \n\n>You can't gain combat skills from missions when you only foght one time during a mission.\n\nYou can, it's combat experience and thus it develops skill. \n\n>Also Kakashi not training them on screen doesn't mean he didn't teach them other stuff off screen. Not all training is shown on screen since that would be unnecessary and boring.\n\nYes, but the characters usually tell you when they train. The show tells us about every instance when someone trains be it by themselves or with someone. I find it odd that it would forget to tell us in this one singular instance. \n\n>Jiraiya taught Naruto chakra control for what? He still needed clones to make rasengan. Had no other jutsu. \n\nFor using his chakra more efficiently and paving the way to master new techniques. The change may not have been drastic but it was still there. \n\n>Got caught in Itachi clones's genjutsu.\n\nThat's Itachi we're talking about. And even though it wasn't really him, Kakashi noted that his jutsu were no different. You're not seriously going to take issue with Jiraiya's training just because he couldn't resist ITACHI. \n\n>Strategically there was no visible Improvments from when he was with Kakshi.\n\nNo? Naruto learned how to ingeniously dodge attacks in mid-air by making his own clone pull him, for example. It's all these small combat techniques and strategies adding up that made the difference. \n\n>Most of the other points seem pretty redundant. He would've learnt how to use how to use shadow clones effeciently by himself. \n\nNo, and Kakashi makes a point of this. During the training for the rasenshuriken, Kakashi points out that Naruto never even realized that he gained any experience his clones gained. So Naruto would also never have realized how to use clones more efficiently by himself as evidenced by his ignorance of that basic fact. \n\n>He could barely control kurama and lost control after 3 tails during the gaara rescue arc\n\nHe could barely control him during **extreme** circumstances. Gaara dying and trying to retrieve Sasuke were extreme emotional triggers for him; no amount of training would've done that any good.",

You're not seriously going to take issue with Jiraiya's training just because he couldn't resist ITACHI. \n\n>Strategically there was no visible Improvments from when he was with Kakshi.\n\nNo?

So Naruto would also never have realized how to use clones more efficiently by himself as evidenced by his ignorance of that basic fact. \n\n>He could barely control kurama and lost control after 3 tails during the gaara rescue arc\n\nHe could barely control him during **extreme** circumstances.

            "body": ">Is there any proof for the first statement. That their skills came from doing missions?\n\nIt's inferred from 2 things: 1-we never see Kakashi train them with anything relevant to the feats 2-Kakashi acts surprised when he sees Naruto and Sakura perform in their exam matches with Kiba and ino. If he had been there to train them, he would have known where their feats came from, therefore he wouldn't have acted so shocked. \n\n>Because Kurenai and Asuma's teams did the same thing and yet the supposedly weaker students from Kakashi's team were able to match them. \n\nBecause they trained in their own time privately or, in Naruto's case, with Ebisu. \n\n>You can't gain combat skills from missions when you only foght one time during a mission.\n\nYou can, it's combat experience and thus it develops skill. \n\n>Also Kakashi not training them on screen doesn't mean he didn't teach them other stuff off screen. Not all training is shown on screen since that would be unnecessary and boring.\n\nYes, but the characters usually tell you when they train. The show tells us about every instance when someone trains be it by themselves or with someone. I find it odd that it would forget to tell us in this one singular instance. \n\n>Jiraiya taught Naruto chakra control for what? He still needed clones to make rasengan. Had no other jutsu. \n\nFor using his chakra more efficiently and paving the way to master new techniques. The change may not have been drastic but it was still there. \n\n>Got caught in Itachi clones's genjutsu.\n\nThat's Itachi we're talking about. And even though it wasn't really him, Kakashi noted that his jutsu were no different. You're not seriously going to take issue with Jiraiya's training just because he couldn't resist ITACHI. \n\n>Strategically there was no visible Improvments from when he was with Kakshi.\n\nNo? Naruto learned how to ingeniously dodge attacks in mid-air by making his own clone pull him, for example. It's all these small combat techniques and strategies adding up that made the difference. \n\n>Most of the other points seem pretty redundant. He would've learnt how to use how to use shadow clones effeciently by himself. \n\nNo, and Kakashi makes a point of this. During the training for the rasenshuriken, Kakashi points out that Naruto never even realized that he gained any experience his clones gained. So Naruto would also never have realized how to use clones more efficiently by himself as evidenced by his ignorance of that basic fact. \n\n>He could barely control kurama and lost control after 3 tails during the gaara rescue arc\n\nHe could barely control him during **extreme** circumstances. Gaara dying and trying to retrieve Sasuke were extreme emotional triggers for him; no amount of training would've done that any good.",
