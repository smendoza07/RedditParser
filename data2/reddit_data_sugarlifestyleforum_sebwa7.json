    "body": "I\u2019ve been a SB for a few years and I\u2019ve met quite a few SBs along the way. I\u2019ve seen an increased interest with these relationships since the pandemic, and I just wanted to share some things with aspiring/new SBs. One thing I can not stress enough is the fact that this is NOT easy. You come to learn very quickly that everything comes with a price, which is why I wanted to make a post about the uglier side of sugar dating because I find it\u2019s not really talked about. Here are some of the things that many SBs experience. Obviously it\u2019s very dependent on what type of SD you have but here are some common ones I\u2019ve seen women struggle with. \n\n1. You\u2019ll get a lot of very judgmental looks while out in public with your SD. Looks of disgust or pity and it\u2019s something you\u2019ll have to get used to. \n\n2. Depending on how long you do it; you\u2019ll most likely lose friends and family. At the very least it will change the way they see you. \n\n3. There will most likely come a time where you meet someone that you genuinely want a relationship with and you might need to walk away from it because of the lifestyle. \n\n4. You\u2019ll meet men that use financial support to manipulate you. You\u2019ll need to have strong boundaries and a savings account or your mental health will take a hit. \n\n5. If you\u2019re doing this because you\u2019re desperate for financial support, you\u2019ll find yourself laying on a hotel bed with a man you\u2019re disgusted with, staring at the ceiling and waiting for it to be over so you can take a hot shower. (Trust me you don\u2019t want to get here) \n\n6. Using things to cope with the lifestyle. I\u2019ve seen this a lot and it\u2019s a very dangerous habit. It\u2019s not uncommon for girls to develop addictions while doing this. \n\n7. Not being honest with yourself. I\u2019ve seen many friends of mine try to talk themselves into having a better outlook on their sugar relationships. Be honest with yourself, if you\u2019re unhappy take care of your mental health. Don\u2019t try to convince yourself that you\u2019re enjoying anything just to make it a little easier. \n\n\nIf you find the right SD it can be amazing but it takes time. Don\u2019t rush anything out of desperation. Take care of yourself girls, nothing is worth damaging your mental health over. <3",

            "body": "Thanks for posting this! I\u2019ve been so so so discouraged, I\u2019m about ready to just call it quits. I had two successful SD relationships a few years ago, took a break for mental health reasons and decided to try it again as of a few months ago. \n\nI met a guy who took me for a nice dinner and was a really great person, a lot of fun to talk to. I got excited! But he then informed me at the end of the night that he \u201cthought this was just a dating site for rich guys\u201d and wanted me to be attracted to him for him, not his money. He wanted a girlfriend to take home to the family, not an SB. That was disappointing. We\u2019re actually platonic friends now so that\u2019s kinda cool I guess.\n\nThen I met a guy who totally disregarded the safety boundaries I have which are non negotiable. My private info (address, real phone number, last name, social media) is private until I feel that I can trust someone. I don\u2019t budge on that even outside the bowl. He was absolutely downright *nasty* about it. I went to sleep sobbing.\n\nThe last POT I met was one that I had gone on a date with before a couple years ago. He had been nice, but the arrangement he wanted wasn\u2019t something I was looking for, so we just parted ways. Then a few months ago we got back in touch. And I was roofied and raped.\n\nI\u2019m a gentle and kind person. I\u2019m very easy to talk to. I\u2019m intelligent and engaging. I dress fashionably. I\u2019m a great communicator. I\u2019m just not sure what I\u2019m doing wrong. \n\nIs it my area, do you think? Or is the bowl more full of rotten people than it was two years ago?",

            "body": "I'm long out of the bowl (39) but I remember the exact moment that I realized I was done with it. \n\nIt had been fun for a few years. It took one SD that RUIN it. \n\nMind you. I was actually a professional woman. I had a good job. My own home. I didn't need to do this. I did it for purely selfish and materialistic reasons. I had a flexible schedule so it made it easy to meet my SDs. I did it purely for the thrill and the pretty things I could get that I wouldn't otherwise be able to afford. Shoot me. \n\nHe was married. Wife worked outside the home doing charity. He was semi retired. Gorgeous house. A garden I could sit nude in because the neighbors couldn't see. For the first 6 months is was WONDERFUL. Our arrangement was pay for play (I met with him 3 days per week)  but he also took me on dates, nice restaurants, theater, movies, to the zoo. He also bought me presents all the time. New purse? Done. Need new tires for my car. No problem. Random trinket at the mall? Hed hand me his wallet. \n\nThat was until his wife decided to step down from the charity. No problem. We started meeting at hotels. \n\nThen the problem started. He decided that buying a nice hotels was a \"waste of money\" for a couple of hours of play time so he started getting cheap rooms. Then it turned to roach motels.\n\nThen he decided he only wanted to pay me when played and the dates and fun things went away. So did my presents. \n\nI finally cut him off the third time he drove me around for an hour looking for a place to play in the backseat of his SUV and he tossed cash and a pack of baby wipes at me like a hooker. (No shade to hookers but that is NOT how a SD arrangement is supposed to work)\n\nForget that. I didn't need his money. He was actually fun until that point. I think he just got too comfortable and thought that I was desperate. I wasn't. I didn't need a 68 year old fat dude with a micropenis to pay my bills. \n\nI don't regret my time in the sugar bowl. I met some REALLY amazing men. One was the VP of Communications good sized company. He was from Australia and traveled about 250 days of the year and didn't even want sex (though that did happen) he wanted someone with half a brain cell (I have an Aeronautics degree) to talk with, someone to come to dinner with, someone to come to corporate functions with that knew how to dress and talk the part. He treated me like a princess. He gave me a debit card that he loaded every month and it was GENEROUS. \n\nThere was another man, awkward,shy, balding, that NEVER asked me for sex. Just to come with him to work events...he would buy me REALLY beautiful outfits, suits for work, and paid for my cat to have surgery. In addition to a monthly allowance. \n\nBabies, if it isn't fun, then its not worth it. Don't ever get into a situation when you HAVE to do this. You can tend bar and flirt your way to big   tips. (I've done it) Don't settle for the back seat and it  thrown at you. \n\nGood luck!",

Unfortunately many women have no understanding of what a real sugar relationship is and when they join SA they assume all men are SD. \n\nJust look how many SB come on here confused when they get hit up by Johns and they have no idea those men are not real SD.\n\nMany women in my age bracket and younger grew up with apps like Tinder, so hookup culture is very prevalent so a lot of women end up acting the same way on SA and basically end up being low volume escorts whether they realize it or not. Things only get worse for them if they\u2019re financially desperate and make poor decisions.\n\nIf a woman wants to be an escort there is no shame in that, but she shouldn\u2019t do it out of desperation nor should she do it on Seeking.",

I also have been in this life , working in clubs and stuff for almost 8 years now and my family has never found out. \nI agree with most everything you said otherwise though. I think my biggest piece of advice for aspiring SB is make sure you have one friend who you always share your location with & if you have any childhood trauma or issues , make sure your mental health is in check before you start this wild ride.",

Research is definitely something SBs need to do before pursing this lifestyle and make sure you have a backup plan. You never want to do this out of financial constraints because you will get taken advantage of . You must be mentally prepared to deal with this relationship. \n\nThere are many wonderful things that can happen while your having a SR but don't let that fool you because there is a dark side to this. \n\nLastly,  don't turn this into a career make sure you use this lifestyle to help you elevate yourself and put you in a better standing in society.  Take the money and connections to create something long-term for yourself. Don't blow the money on unnecessary material things.. Your SD should be able to provide you with gifts here and there that may quench that there should have to buy luxury items. Don't waste the money because that's money you can't get back remember that.",

Things only get worse for them if they\u2019re financially desperate and make poor decisions.\n\nIf a woman wants to be an escort there is no shame in that, but she shouldn\u2019t do it out of desperation nor should she do it on Seeking.",

Things only get worse for them if they\u2019re financially desperate and make poor decisions.\n\nIf a woman wants to be an escort there is no shame in that, but she shouldn\u2019t do it out of desperation nor should she do it on Seeking.",
