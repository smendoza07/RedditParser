I\u2019ve seen disconnected undercuts underneath the side part for a fobbier asian cut and those work really well. But you will need to go to a korean/asian stylist to achieve that type of cut. But for an american style like the above picture, essentially the barber has to taper it so it blends in welI. To solve the asian hair sticking out on the sides, the hair closest to the line of the part, will  overlap the shorter hairs on the side to bring it to a more rounder look. It took me years of trial and error to achieve that look. Doing the part can be frustrating at first, but hair has muscle memory and the more you do it, the easier it will be. Anything is possible with enough wax, blow drier, and hairspray.\n\nOnce your hair is long, like 2-3 inches, go to the bathroom and wet your hair. Take a straight comb and prepare to stand in front of your mirror for a long duration. Choose a side to part. To have a conservative part, the line should line up with the outer rim of your eye\u2019s iris. If you want a more aggressive street part, bring it more towards the center. But not too much. Make sure that the line is clear and clean. In order for you to get the backside, have your phone ready for selfies. Trial and error. Once you are satisfied with the part, go to your barber and give them the picture. I give my barber a picture of Hassan Minhaj\u2019s hair style. They should know what to do with the rest. If you are unsure of the line, ask the barber to fix it.\n\nAfter the cut, recreating the part should be a lot easier because one side of the part is going to be longer than the other side. Wet hair, blow dry, rub in wax, blow dry bring all the hair to one direction. Then once satisfied, you can bring the shorter hairs to the opposite direction to create the part. After that, you will get individuals strands of hair that sticks out called flies. You can bring these down with heavier product or hairspray.",

And even if he did, your hair would just look like the bottom photo the next time you washed it. You need to do the styling yourself.",

No skinfade, shorter the more it goes to the side, thats a transition not an undercut.  \nAnd I got even asked if i don't trust her.   \nYeah I would if I didn't had to switch barbers all the time because every fucking one does not understand how to do their job.  \n\n\nI tried 7 different ones in the last 2 years.  \nStayed at one for quite long since the female there way quite good at what she was doing, but the owner did after some time most of my hair, probably because i tipped quite decent and he wanted it, idk.   \nTried to sell me overpriced no hold products and was a firm believer that hair color changes thickness, yes many black haired dudes have thick hair and many blonde have fine hair, but thats a correlation not causation.   \nI have seen dudes with pitch black but fine hair and some with blonde or quite light brown and theirs was thick.  \n\n\nI just don't know anymore and don't want to pay 35 Bucks just to get a decent haircut.

They are a business and every minute after 15 minutes spent on cutting your hair for $20, is wasted. Unless you are willing to dish $40+, don\u2019t expect the barber to give that type of cut.

I\u2019ve seen disconnected undercuts underneath the side part for a fobbier asian cut and those work really well. But you will need to go to a korean/asian stylist to achieve that type of cut. But for an american style like the above picture, essentially the barber has to taper it so it blends in welI. To solve the asian hair sticking out on the sides, the hair closest to the line of the part, will  overlap the shorter hairs on the side to bring it to a more rounder look. It took me years of trial and error to achieve that look. Doing the part can be frustrating at first, but hair has muscle memory and the more you do it, the easier it will be. Anything is possible with enough wax, blow drier, and hairspray.\n\nOnce your hair is long, like 2-3 inches, go to the bathroom and wet your hair. Take a straight comb and prepare to stand in front of your mirror for a long duration. Choose a side to part. To have a conservative part, the line should line up with the outer rim of your eye\u2019s iris. If you want a more aggressive street part, bring it more towards the center. But not too much. Make sure that the line is clear and clean. In order for you to get the backside, have your phone ready for selfies. Trial and error. Once you are satisfied with the part, go to your barber and give them the picture. I give my barber a picture of Hassan Minhaj\u2019s hair style. They should know what to do with the rest. If you are unsure of the line, ask the barber to fix it.\n\nAfter the cut, recreating the part should be a lot easier because one side of the part is going to be longer than the other side. Wet hair, blow dry, rub in wax, blow dry bring all the hair to one direction. Then once satisfied, you can bring the shorter hairs to the opposite direction to create the part. After that, you will get individuals strands of hair that sticks out called flies. You can bring these down with heavier product or hairspray.",

But you will need to go to a korean/asian stylist to achieve that type of cut. But for an american style like the above picture, essentially the barber has to taper it so it blends in welI. To solve the asian hair sticking out on the sides, the hair closest to the line of the part, will  overlap the shorter hairs on the side to bring it to a more rounder look. It took me years of trial and error to achieve that look. Doing the part can be frustrating at first, but hair has muscle memory and the more you do it, the easier it will be. Anything is possible with enough wax, blow drier, and hairspray.\n\nOnce your hair is long, like 2-3 inches, go to the bathroom and wet your hair. Take a straight comb and prepare to stand in front of your mirror for a long duration. Choose a side to part. To have a conservative part, the line should line up with the outer rim of your eye\u2019s iris. If you want a more aggressive street part, bring it more towards the center. But not too much. Make sure that the line is clear and clean. In order for you to get the backside, have your phone ready for selfies. Trial and error. Once you are satisfied with the part, go to your barber and give them the picture. I give my barber a picture of Hassan Minhaj\u2019s hair style. They should know what to do with the rest. If you are unsure of the line, ask the barber to fix it.\n\nAfter the cut, recreating the part should be a lot easier because one side of the part is going to be longer than the other side. Wet hair, blow dry, rub in wax, blow dry bring all the hair to one direction. Then once satisfied, you can bring the shorter hairs to the opposite direction to create the part. After that, you will get individuals strands of hair that sticks out called flies. You can bring these down with heavier product or hairspray.",

OP needs to grow his hair out at least another couple of inches and pick a side to part and do it himself.\n\nThe key is to do the part yourself and then go to the barber for them to trim and make it pretty. Unless you go to a well renowned barbershop, they aren\u2019t gnna do shit for you. I learned that barbers, they will not spend more than 15 minutes cutting your hair., unless they like you. They are a business and every minute after 15 minutes spent on cutting your hair for $20, is wasted. Unless you are willing to dish $40+, don\u2019t expect the barber to give that type of cut. Especially the older barbers who are notorious for just doing what they do best (nice fade and short)\n\nI have asian korean hair and it sticks out just like OP\u2019s. But I was able to get the picture on top. It definitely needs to be longer.",

But you will need to go to a korean/asian stylist to achieve that type of cut. But for an american style like the above picture, essentially the barber has to taper it so it blends in welI. To solve the asian hair sticking out on the sides, the hair closest to the line of the part, will  overlap the shorter hairs on the side to bring it to a more rounder look. It took me years of trial and error to achieve that look. Doing the part can be frustrating at first, but hair has muscle memory and the more you do it, the easier it will be. Anything is possible with enough wax, blow drier, and hairspray.\n\nOnce your hair is long, like 2-3 inches, go to the bathroom and wet your hair. Take a straight comb and prepare to stand in front of your mirror for a long duration. Choose a side to part. To have a conservative part, the line should line up with the outer rim of your eye\u2019s iris. If you want a more aggressive street part, bring it more towards the center. But not too much. Make sure that the line is clear and clean. In order for you to get the backside, have your phone ready for selfies. Trial and error. Once you are satisfied with the part, go to your barber and give them the picture. I give my barber a picture of Hassan Minhaj\u2019s hair style. They should know what to do with the rest. If you are unsure of the line, ask the barber to fix it.\n\nAfter the cut, recreating the part should be a lot easier because one side of the part is going to be longer than the other side. Wet hair, blow dry, rub in wax, blow dry bring all the hair to one direction. Then once satisfied, you can bring the shorter hairs to the opposite direction to create the part. After that, you will get individuals strands of hair that sticks out called flies. You can bring these down with heavier product or hairspray.",

But you will need to go to a korean/asian stylist to achieve that type of cut. But for an american style like the above picture, essentially the barber has to taper it so it blends in welI. To solve the asian hair sticking out on the sides, the hair closest to the line of the part, will  overlap the shorter hairs on the side to bring it to a more rounder look. It took me years of trial and error to achieve that look. Doing the part can be frustrating at first, but hair has muscle memory and the more you do it, the easier it will be. Anything is possible with enough wax, blow drier, and hairspray.\n\nOnce your hair is long, like 2-3 inches, go to the bathroom and wet your hair. Take a straight comb and prepare to stand in front of your mirror for a long duration. Choose a side to part. To have a conservative part, the line should line up with the outer rim of your eye\u2019s iris. If you want a more aggressive street part, bring it more towards the center. But not too much. Make sure that the line is clear and clean. In order for you to get the backside, have your phone ready for selfies. Trial and error. Once you are satisfied with the part, go to your barber and give them the picture. I give my barber a picture of Hassan Minhaj\u2019s hair style. They should know what to do with the rest. If you are unsure of the line, ask the barber to fix it.\n\nAfter the cut, recreating the part should be a lot easier because one side of the part is going to be longer than the other side. Wet hair, blow dry, rub in wax, blow dry bring all the hair to one direction. Then once satisfied, you can bring the shorter hairs to the opposite direction to create the part. After that, you will get individuals strands of hair that sticks out called flies. You can bring these down with heavier product or hairspray.",

But you will need to go to a korean/asian stylist to achieve that type of cut. But for an american style like the above picture, essentially the barber has to taper it so it blends in welI. To solve the asian hair sticking out on the sides, the hair closest to the line of the part, will  overlap the shorter hairs on the side to bring it to a more rounder look. It took me years of trial and error to achieve that look. Doing the part can be frustrating at first, but hair has muscle memory and the more you do it, the easier it will be. Anything is possible with enough wax, blow drier, and hairspray.\n\nOnce your hair is long, like 2-3 inches, go to the bathroom and wet your hair. Take a straight comb and prepare to stand in front of your mirror for a long duration. Choose a side to part. To have a conservative part, the line should line up with the outer rim of your eye\u2019s iris. If you want a more aggressive street part, bring it more towards the center. But not too much. Make sure that the line is clear and clean. In order for you to get the backside, have your phone ready for selfies. Trial and error. Once you are satisfied with the part, go to your barber and give them the picture. I give my barber a picture of Hassan Minhaj\u2019s hair style. They should know what to do with the rest. If you are unsure of the line, ask the barber to fix it.\n\nAfter the cut, recreating the part should be a lot easier because one side of the part is going to be longer than the other side. Wet hair, blow dry, rub in wax, blow dry bring all the hair to one direction. Then once satisfied, you can bring the shorter hairs to the opposite direction to create the part. After that, you will get individuals strands of hair that sticks out called flies. You can bring these down with heavier product or hairspray.",
