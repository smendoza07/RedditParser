    "body": "I\u2019ve been a lurker for awhile now and I have seen some of the same posts so I thought I would share. I was a SB in 2019 for a couple of months before I met my last SD /future husband. I had been on seeking for a little while but honestly more salt daddies than sugar. I was given some advice to move to tinder so I thought hey couldn\u2019t hurt. Now this is where it begins to start to sound fake even to me. \nI met him on the first day on the site, set up a meeting a week later because he wasn\u2019t from my state. We texted non stop, he sent me an incentive to make sure I showed up later on I found out. Never asked for anything. \n\nFast forward a week later we have our first M&G at Manny\u2019s steakhouse in Minneapolis. If your familiar with the area it is literally the most expensive restaurant in town. It was honestly magical. We talked non stop no awkwardness. Then comes dessert. We are both football fans and the Seahawks just happen to be playing the Vikings. He used that as an excuse to get me to come up after to watch the game. I broke so many of my rules that night because he just felt safe. I stayed the night at the hotel with him.\nNext morning I had to rush to make it to my clinical a at a nearby hospital. He walks me down to the lobby at like 5am does the walk of shame with me. Thought I\u2019ll never see him again. Too good to be true right? \nI get a morning text a little while later and asked if he could bring by the wine/ gift he picked up from Nordstrom before he left for his flight? Here I go again breaking rules of mine and letting him come to my clinical location. We sat and had an amazing lunch. Thought this is it. \n\n Fast forward to 3 years later. During the pandemic we traveled the country together for his work, literally spent all of the pandemic together, countless amazing trips, shopping trips ( I have a thing for LV and red bottoms) now we have a son (his first son), getting married in October on the day this journey started in the Maldives ( we waited because I was pregnant and no wants to get married fat and pregnant lol) building a multi millionaire dollar home on the west coast in a beautiful diverse progressive city. \n\n I wanted to share to tell all my fellow SB\u2019s you can literally have it all. Just takes the one. Oh and did I forget to mention I\u2019m black in my 20\u2019s and he\u2019s a white man in his 50\u2019s. I see on here all the time women being told a certain man isn\u2019t interested in them. That\u2019s so not true. Just go for it. We can both say we\u2019ve never been happier. He is my best friend in the world.",
