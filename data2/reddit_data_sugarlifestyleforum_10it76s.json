    "body": "I\u2019ve seen so many posts over the past year of sugar babies saying they can\u2019t find anyone and he only wants nudes, he wants to have sex but doesn\u2019t want to provide a PPM, or they aren\u2019t getting any messages. \n\nI see all kinds of responses like \u201clots of salt daddies out there, keep looking!\u201d or \u201cthe bowl can be frustrating, be patient\u201d. These are bad responses and give false hope. Some people suggest a profile review, which is better. You should always see what their profile looks like before making a judgment as to whether or not they deserve to get an SD. \n\nSometimes they will show their colors and say they want platonic. Other times they won\u2019t. What\u2019s common in most of these scenarios is that they aren\u2019t attractive enough to be a sugar baby. A lot of women have an inflated sense of self and think they are much more attractive than they actually are. Which is sort of understandable, even a woman who\u2019s below average looking can sign on a dating app and have dozens of matches within a day. But like many SLFers have said, this doesn\u2019t translate to the sugar world when men are paying allowances and ppm. The standards for looks are simply higher in the bowl, and SBs outnumber SDs.",

It\u2019s clear that women who are pretty are approached more in general and that standard is raised in the bowl. \n\nIt took me two months to find an SD. I have no idea if that\u2019s an inordinate amount of time or not, but it does include the time I spent trying to find one *I* also liked. I find probably 10% of all men I meet attractive in general, and truthfully most of the men in the bowl do not appeal to me even with financial incentive. Women, in general, need to learn how to invest their time in viable options instead of wasting time with men who clearly don\u2019t have money but yet are more attractive. A lot of the times when people ask me about their approach it\u2019s that they have a diva attitude which repels people, they have extremely high expectations, they have masculine energy that appears domineering or hard to please, etc. Things that make it difficult for them to launch from message to M&G. I have genuinely seen unattractive women (in my eyes anyway) do well, and it\u2019s generally because they understand how men work and how relationships work in general. \n\nAppearance is a large factor, but certainly not all of it.",

I'd add to that by saying that there's a continuum starting from the \"diva\" you mentioned through \"selective', through \"not fussy at all\".\n\nIt's not really a bad or unreasonable strategy for a woman to date on Seeking etc but narrow her choices to guys in her own age group and be attractive,  and have money. Now, the odds are one in a hundred thousand, but if it costs nothing,  why not try?\n\nFurther, a lot of SD posts here stress that they want SBs who are attracted (or can at least act convincingly, lol). So, one can then hardly complain if women take them seriously and simply won't take on a SD unless they are age appropriate and attractive...for that age bracket.\n\nIt also depends on the context of the conversation. If the context is SDs saying she should only go for guys she's attracted to, and attractive,  that might mean there are none in her area once she excludes the average looking guys with dad bods offering average ppm.",

No one is denying this.\n3. But, no one is the gatekeeper for what is \"attractive enough\" or \"who deserves a SR\". Let everyone chart their own course.\n4. Our goal here isn't to give false hope, but to give everyone asking for advice the best chance of finding the SR they are looking for (even if doesn't ultimately happen). We want them to put their best foot forward.\n5. To often this is taken as an excuse by bitter men to attack or ridicule women.

I think it's very true that 90% of the people are probably some degree of ambivalence/flexible with their stated goals, and or have multiple interest/goals that might contradict each other. These are probably also the people who insist on being vague until the other person specifies their interests first.\n\nYou can simultaneously want sex and a relationship, and that's why some men who may genuinely want a real SR with a relationship behave like Johns. I find myself not completely immune to that, as sometimes in ensuring the POT isn't \"platonic\" there's not very many good ways to communicate, and your \"little head\" might take over if there's source of sexual frustration outside of the bowl.\n\nI think for SD's who (hopefully with enough self-awareness) finds themselves meeting this description, its probably better to just actually find their relief elsewhere in more suitable channels to get it out of the way so that frustration does not cloud their judgment/interactions in the bowl.",

While we've all hit frustrations in the bowl, I've never struggled to find a 'decent' SB.  (struggle to find a great SGF - yeah, that can be harder).  And depending on who you ask, the allowance I provide is somewhere between average / Splenda.  \n\nGenerally I think most of the guys that have struggles - have it for a very good reason.

The top 1% can make any deal they like with whoever they like.  Beyond that it's a very different matter indeed.  Also, you really won't find the top 1% on Seeking to any large extent.\n\nI remember a former mod here who was a successful SB once said:-\n\n>Remember - Seeking isn't really aimed at the top 0.01% of either, it makes its money from the 99th percentile guy who's looking for the 99th percentile cute barista who makes his coffee in Starbucks each morning (and the 90th percentile guy who wants to think of himself as a 99th percentile guy) - it doesn't matter to Seeking if a guy's UHNW paying a 5X allowance, what matters is he can afford his monthly sub to SA\n>\n>The bowl, for the most part, is everyday wealth looking for everyday attractive - a handful of 0.1% girls and a lot of 90th percentile girls with a handful of 0.1% guys and a lot of 90th percentile guys - as long as they have those it doesn't matter how many <50th% guys & girls there are, the 90th percentiles provide the liquidity that makes it work, and the top 0.1% (and the possibility of the top 0.01%) on each side provide the marketing illusion",

They can complain about not finding a Megan Fox if they aren't paying Megan Fox prices. Beauty is costly to begin with so it's expected when you see all natural girls who haven't gone under the knife yet. \n\nAll I can say is men on here are way more picky or ( only want 18 to 23, only want blonde hair blue eyes which is code word for no minorities, want a thin girl forgetting plenty of healthy weight women aren't all stick thin, ready for sex after the 2nd date) I can go on.

As you said that SBs control the market is totally false, in a vanilla setting it\u2019s totally true but in sugar dating men are in more control just citing an example if you open tinder subs or bumble subs the profile review is dominated by men 99% where as in this sub 99% profile review is from women. \n\nAlso women complain that they aren\u2019t finding whales because they aren\u2019t able to stand the entitlement of the whales. There are not many person who are rich but not entitled.\n\nI can say that women expect high xxx for meet and greets and high xxxx allowance from the second date itself without the intimacy. Anyone irrespective of race if attractive enough can have a bit easier time finding SD and those are a bit unconventional example too obese, too much tattoos, too much piercings, hippie/goth vibes is gonna have difficult time (the bowl has fickle beauty standards it may be harsh but its true).\n\nThere will always be a middle ground between expectations and reality.",

Better not assign numerical values to something than assign questionable ones.\n\nThere's already a lot of feedback potential SBs can get. If I am not completely wrong, the number of upvotes a profile review receives already serves more or less as a proxy for the auto-poll you propose. It's more attractive SBs, not better profiles that get more upvotes. Additionally, positive comments such as \"you will do well in the bowl\" -- or lack thereof -- are telling.\n\nI've never been on SA, but I assume the number of received messages can be used as an indicator, too.\n\nFundamentally, someone's popularity in vanilla dating is a good estimator for chances in the bowl. Using that as a starting point and then some try-and-error is the way to go. It's not that hard. I would be reluctant to outsource this process to some \"Reddit court\".",

Though I would weight the SD responses here a lot more.\n\nNumber of received messages on SA is not particularly useful for any SB, because they are almost entirely scammers and johns (no matter what profile they have or how attractive), significantly region-based, and without any method to calibrate and turn that into a signal. \n\nVanilla is not a good estimator because any given woman will do much better in vanilla than sugar. And IMO there are a large amount of them who can be sucessfull in vanilla and struggle mightily in sugar. \n\nWhile this community is biased and relatively small N, I think SLF members voting might be is your best proxy for will a real SD click on a profile and message on SA.

If you ask us to look at a group of women and put them into categories ranging from very unattractive to moderately attractive to very attractive - the results are going to be the same over and over and over again, with only minor variations.\n\nThat experiment plays out in the wild in bars, on reddit profile reviews, on street corners and anywhere humans tend to congregate, always with the same results.  The women I find attractive, ALL other men ALSO find attractive (accounting for preferences, tastes, fetishes and kinks allowing for variations).  That strongly implies looks that inspire sexual desire are objective, not subjective.\n\nAdd onto that that almost all conventional attributes of physical beauty - rosy red cheeks for example - are indicators of strong fertility and healthy genetics, and you have a compelling argument that we are pre-programmed to find a certain and specific look attractive in our mates because its beneficial for evolution and the survival of the species.\n\nIt's a common sense argument that just holds weight and it's the one I buy the most.\n\nIt's easy to dismiss the counter argument that beauty is subjective as a politically correct or woke agenda - there are NO ugly people, tell everyone they're beautiful, you do you, etc etc.\n\nBut I think the more compelling argument is that society can set standards of beauty - up to a point.  Like Kim Kardashian did for wide hips.\n\nAnd that someone can become more or less attractive due to factors totally unrelated to their looks, that's always fascinated me.\n\nStill, good looks are at least in part objective, IMO.  That's the common sense answer.",

What does money mean to you? What does time mean to her? Is it not a fair trade that you value her time enough to give up something she values equally?\n\nThe problem is some SDs who think that their money entitles them to think badly of others. Not just treat them badly, but think of them badly. Just because you're rich doesn't mean you need to focus solely on beauty or physical desirable traits. You can, but it doesn't make you less shallow to do so just because you're giving the woman a bit of money. The money SDs give to their SBs is never enough to pay for dignity and respect, yet so many SDs speak disrespectfully about women. Money doesn't make anyone less of a person and it doesn't mean you don't have to hold yourself to a spiritual or personal standard. \n\nYou're right, you don't have to settle. On the other hand, you also shouldn't be someone an SB is settling for because the money is worth it to her. You two both bring equal things to the table, so why should an SB be the only one who takes care of herself, dresses up, is friendly and outgoing and kind if you're only offering money?",

I actually think it isn\u2019t. I\u2019m fine with people criticizing SDs if they deserve it and I have the comments to back it up. \n\nI posted this because I find it a little annoying that newbies keep posting this over and over. Maybe we should have something stickied that if you\u2019re having trouble finding someone then you should do a profile review. I never said that some people think that everyone can find someone in the bowl. Rather I said that some people think they have what it takes to be successful in sugar and command a high ppm, when this is simply not the case. I would have loved to play in the NFL, but my body type just is not suited for it. When there\u2019s money involved, there is rejection involved, and some of the new SBs maybe have never been rejected before. \n\nIf I\u2019m saving them time and preventing them from getting scammed, I\u2019m actually helping them.",

Another reason could be because nowadays the legitimate SDs just use Instagram to find their SBs. There\u2019s an array of reasons. Get out of here, John.",

That rating needs to be a tad higher for a man to be willing to spend limited and infrequent amounts of money on her. Consistently spending significant amounts of money on a woman, dude has to be head over heels in love or find her to be close to a 10 in appearance. I'm not saying any of this is fair to women, but it is the reality of how most men think. It is very different from how women think and why most struggle to understand most men. Also, men tend to be the ones with inflated opinions of themselves. The higher the opinion, the higher the threshold of the ratings I mentioned before. Men also get bored with physical appearance. Back in the days of my youth I was admiring aloud, a young woman who would be considered a 10, and a wise OG looked and me and said yeah, but somewhere, some dude is tired of that.",

A man with means has more options available to him in the same way that a conventionally attractive man will have more options available. \n\nThe point is, men will ask for nudes, marry and spend small sums of money on women they find on the lower scale of attractiveness.

He was also saying how recent surveys show they all felt entitled to get this type of man. This is probably why so many delusional women come to Seeking. They might get a lot of attention by 1000s of thirsty guys on tinder who swipe on everyone, and so they think they're going to land a SD",

Most people will not have long term healthy relationships and a pretty face wont guarantee anything in life. Physical attractiveness is part 1. Then there's personal likability and charisma. Some people just have \"it\". Finally there's part 3 which is compatibility.  You can be the most physically attractive woman in the world but if you are neither likeable to a guy or compatible, it won't make a difference. \n\nI have been told I can have any many I want by older men, but I have no one who is compatible with me. I also get told that I'm \"different\" a lot and I have never had a man who has approached me without prejudice. Anyone who has dealt with prejudice knows that it'a not something they want to deal with. Between men being overtly sexual (which they have been towards me since I was 9) and prejudice, it feels impossible to get in a relationship sugar dating or otherwise. Most people don't have my circumstances in life so they wont get it but my point is that there is no rule for why someone cant get into a relationship. Some of us have are just too different ( and most humans like people they can relate to or someone who can fit into their world). Looks aren't even half the battle.",

I hate to tell you this but \"attractive\" is relative to what attracts you.\n\nThere are more men coming forward about how much they want a woman bigger or taller or thicker than them (and many who would love to be crushed or lifted or tossed or stepped on or otherwise wrecked by said Tall Babe)... so the dynamic of 'small short skinny girl with big stronk hairy lumberjack' isn't the only way to be. \n\nSome people for example find anything over a size 5 to be intolerably fat. They equate this to being disgusting and unfit and in no way attractive.\n\nSome people find the literal opposite to be true: the bigger the better. They LOVE the massive thunder-thighs and boulder-boobies. They LOVE seeing you wiggle and jiggle and looking at your curves. \n\nSome men just really love the Michelin Man look I guess... Either way, you don't get to tell them what they are required to think is sexy. \n\nIf there are sugar-babies out there whom you find gross, there are probably Sugar Parents out there who would absolutely love to meet them (but just haven't yet). \n\nNow I will say that basing how you feel about someone on a fetish is never a good idea. I had one ex who loved/desired extremely hefty women... Like, wider than they are tall, so fat they can't see their feet, FAT. OK, fair enough I guess. I was just hurt when he said I was the skinniest woman he had ever fallen in love with, but that if I lost any weight (even for my health) then he'd no longer feel attracted to me. Like, ok thanks for uh... 'loving' me I guess... \n\nSo when you say they're ugly, I guess it's a good thing your opinion of them doesn't matter if you're not the one paying their bills??",

I'd add to that by saying that there's a continuum starting from the \"diva\" you mentioned through \"selective', through \"not fussy at all\".\n\nIt's not really a bad or unreasonable strategy for a woman to date on Seeking etc but narrow her choices to guys in her own age group and be attractive,  and have money. Now, the odds are one in a hundred thousand, but if it costs nothing,  why not try?\n\nFurther, a lot of SD posts here stress that they want SBs who are attracted (or can at least act convincingly, lol). So, one can then hardly complain if women take them seriously and simply won't take on a SD unless they are age appropriate and attractive...for that age bracket.\n\nIt also depends on the context of the conversation. If the context is SDs saying she should only go for guys she's attracted to, and attractive,  that might mean there are none in her area once she excludes the average looking guys with dad bods offering average ppm.",

I never advocated for telling them they aren\u2019t attractive. \n\nYes, different people have different preferences. But I would say being obese isn\u2019t attractive. Or having tons of tattoos isn\u2019t attractive to most SDs. Some things, you just have to acknowledge.

The common trope that \"talented/beautiful people are just lucky, I'll put more work than them\" doesn't work when people with talent and luck *also* chooses to put in effort! And that's honestly how the top of the top people get to where they are.\n\n\"Unrealistic\" is probably the fairest way to put it. There's probably more \"sub-average\" women than OP thinks who can in fact find an SD at average allowance if they send 100 ***personalized*** messages screening 1000 profiles, but it must also be acknowledged that for some women between what they have and the effort they're willing to make, it's simply not happening, and sometimes, its important to accept that \"that someone could be me.\"",

But much less likely to find consistent, long term SRs.   In effect, they only find johns treating them like sex workers.\n\nThan they inevitably come back to this sub - and talk about how all SDs are just johns - as that's all they can attract.\n\n(Of course, the same thing happens with men.  They act like johns - and then wonder why all they attract is the sex workers).",

I think it's very true that 90% of the people are probably some degree of ambivalence/flexible with their stated goals, and or have multiple interest/goals that might contradict each other. These are probably also the people who insist on being vague until the other person specifies their interests first.\n\nYou can simultaneously want sex and a relationship, and that's why some men who may genuinely want a real SR with a relationship behave like Johns. I find myself not completely immune to that, as sometimes in ensuring the POT isn't \"platonic\" there's not very many good ways to communicate, and your \"little head\" might take over if there's source of sexual frustration outside of the bowl.\n\nI think for SD's who (hopefully with enough self-awareness) finds themselves meeting this description, its probably better to just actually find their relief elsewhere in more suitable channels to get it out of the way so that frustration does not cloud their judgment/interactions in the bowl.",

They can complain about not finding a Megan Fox if they aren't paying Megan Fox prices. Beauty is costly to begin with so it's expected when you see all natural girls who haven't gone under the knife yet. \n\nAll I can say is men on here are way more picky or ( only want 18 to 23, only want blonde hair blue eyes which is code word for no minorities, want a thin girl forgetting plenty of healthy weight women aren't all stick thin, ready for sex after the 2nd date) I can go on. I just wish they would shut up.",

There are not many person who are rich but not entitled.\n\nI can say that women expect high xxx for meet and greets and high xxxx allowance from the second date itself without the intimacy. Anyone irrespective of race if attractive enough can have a bit easier time finding SD and those are a bit unconventional example too obese, too much tattoos, too much piercings, hippie/goth vibes is gonna have difficult time (the bowl has fickle beauty standards it may be harsh but its true).\n\nThere will always be a middle ground between expectations and reality.",

If it's not, it is better not to give the false impression that it can. Better not assign numerical values to something than assign questionable ones.\n\nThere's already a lot of feedback potential SBs can get. If I am not completely wrong, the number of upvotes a profile review receives already serves more or less as a proxy for the auto-poll you propose. It's more attractive SBs, not better profiles that get more upvotes. Additionally, positive comments such as \"you will do well in the bowl\" -- or lack thereof -- are telling.\n\nI've never been on SA, but I assume the number of received messages can be used as an indicator, too.\n\nFundamentally, someone's popularity in vanilla dating is a good estimator for chances in the bowl. Using that as a starting point and then some try-and-error is the way to go. It's not that hard. I would be reluctant to outsource this process to some \"Reddit court\".",

Though I would weight the SD responses here a lot more.\n\nNumber of received messages on SA is not particularly useful for any SB, because they are almost entirely scammers and johns (no matter what profile they have or how attractive), significantly region-based, and without any method to calibrate and turn that into a signal. \n\nVanilla is not a good estimator because any given woman will do much better in vanilla than sugar.

If you ask us to look at a group of women and put them into categories ranging from very unattractive to moderately attractive to very attractive - the results are going to be the same over and over and over again, with only minor variations.\n\nThat experiment plays out in the wild in bars, on reddit profile reviews, on street corners and anywhere humans tend to congregate, always with the same results.  The women I find attractive, ALL other men ALSO find attractive (accounting for preferences, tastes, fetishes and kinks allowing for variations).  That strongly implies looks that inspire sexual desire are objective, not subjective.\n\nAdd onto that that almost all conventional attributes of physical beauty - rosy red cheeks for example - are indicators of strong fertility and healthy genetics, and you have a compelling argument that we are pre-programmed to find a certain and specific look attractive in our mates because its beneficial for evolution and the survival of the species.\n\nIt's a common sense argument that just holds weight and it's the one I buy the most.\n\nIt's easy to dismiss the counter argument that beauty is subjective as a politically correct or woke agenda - there are NO ugly people, tell everyone they're beautiful, you do you, etc etc.\n\nBut I think the more compelling argument is that society can set standards of beauty - up to a point.  Like Kim Kardashian did for wide hips.\n\nAnd that someone can become more or less attractive due to factors totally unrelated to their looks, that's always fascinated me.\n\nStill, good looks are at least in part objective, IMO.  That's the common sense answer.",

What does money mean to you? What does time mean to her? Is it not a fair trade that you value her time enough to give up something she values equally?\n\nThe problem is some SDs who think that their money entitles them to think badly of others. Not just treat them badly, but think of them badly. Just because you're rich doesn't mean you need to focus solely on beauty or physical desirable traits. You can, but it doesn't make you less shallow to do so just because you're giving the woman a bit of money. The money SDs give to their SBs is never enough to pay for dignity and respect, yet so many SDs speak disrespectfully about women. Money doesn't make anyone less of a person and it doesn't mean you don't have to hold yourself to a spiritual or personal standard. \n\nYou're right, you don't have to settle. On the other hand, you also shouldn't be someone an SB is settling for because the money is worth it to her. You two both bring equal things to the table, so why should an SB be the only one who takes care of herself, dresses up, is friendly and outgoing and kind if you're only offering money?",

Most men will screw, or ask for nudes from almost any woman they would rate as a 4 and above in physical attraction. The rating needs to be slightly higher in order for that same man to marry a particular woman. That rating needs to be a tad higher for a man to be willing to spend limited and infrequent amounts of money on her. Consistently spending significant amounts of money on a woman, dude has to be head over heels in love or find her to be close to a 10 in appearance. I'm not saying any of this is fair to women, but it is the reality of how most men think. It is very different from how women think and why most struggle to understand most men. Also, men tend to be the ones with inflated opinions of themselves. The higher the opinion, the higher the threshold of the ratings I mentioned before. Men also get bored with physical appearance. Back in the days of my youth I was admiring aloud, a young woman who would be considered a 10, and a wise OG looked and me and said yeah, but somewhere, some dude is tired of that.",

It\u2019s happening because the men are duping her to believe that they are interested SD\u2019s when they are misrepresenting themselves.\n\nThe thought that ONLY consensus 10\u2019s can sugar date is a fallacy. One man\u2019s 10 may be another man\u2019s 6. Many men thirst after Kim Khardasian but, for me, her body is a huge turnoff.",

Of the men that would ask for nudes, they do so from women that they would rate a 4 and above.\n\nSecondly you've missed the point entirely. The thought process of a man with means is no different than the thought process of a man without. The difference is options. A man with means has more options available to him in the same way that a conventionally attractive man will have more options available. \n\nThe point is, men will ask for nudes, marry and spend small sums of money on women they find on the lower scale of attractiveness. Your logic originally was that if a man asks for nudes he must find her attractive. That's not at all true. The effort or money a man spends on a woman he isn't in love with is directly proportional to her level of attractiveness.",

I think it's very true that 90% of the people are probably some degree of ambivalence/flexible with their stated goals, and or have multiple interest/goals that might contradict each other. These are probably also the people who insist on being vague until the other person specifies their interests first.\n\nYou can simultaneously want sex and a relationship, and that's why some men who may genuinely want a real SR with a relationship behave like Johns. I find myself not completely immune to that, as sometimes in ensuring the POT isn't \"platonic\" there's not very many good ways to communicate, and your \"little head\" might take over if there's source of sexual frustration outside of the bowl.\n\nI think for SD's who (hopefully with enough self-awareness) finds themselves meeting this description, its probably better to just actually find their relief elsewhere in more suitable channels to get it out of the way so that frustration does not cloud their judgment/interactions in the bowl.",

While we've all hit frustrations in the bowl, I've never struggled to find a 'decent' SB.  (struggle to find a great SGF - yeah, that can be harder).  And depending on who you ask, the allowance I provide is somewhere between average / Splenda.  \n\nGenerally I think most of the guys that have struggles - have it for a very good reason.

The top 1% can make any deal they like with whoever they like.  Beyond that it's a very different matter indeed.  Also, you really won't find the top 1% on Seeking to any large extent.\n\nI remember a former mod here who was a successful SB once said:-\n\n>Remember - Seeking isn't really aimed at the top 0.01% of either, it makes its money from the 99th percentile guy who's looking for the 99th percentile cute barista who makes his coffee in Starbucks each morning (and the 90th percentile guy who wants to think of himself as a 99th percentile guy) - it doesn't matter to Seeking if a guy's UHNW paying a 5X allowance, what matters is he can afford his monthly sub to SA\n>\n>The bowl, for the most part, is everyday wealth looking for everyday attractive - a handful of 0.1% girls and a lot of 90th percentile girls with a handful of 0.1% guys and a lot of 90th percentile guys - as long as they have those it doesn't matter how many <50th% guys & girls there are, the 90th percentiles provide the liquidity that makes it work, and the top 0.1% (and the possibility of the top 0.01%) on each side provide the marketing illusion",

Though I would weight the SD responses here a lot more.\n\nNumber of received messages on SA is not particularly useful for any SB, because they are almost entirely scammers and johns (no matter what profile they have or how attractive), significantly region-based, and without any method to calibrate and turn that into a signal. \n\nVanilla is not a good estimator because any given woman will do much better in vanilla than sugar. And IMO there are a large amount of them who can be sucessfull in vanilla and struggle mightily in sugar. \n\nWhile this community is biased and relatively small N, I think SLF members voting might be is your best proxy for will a real SD click on a profile and message on SA. The fraction of real SDs here is IMO massively higher than SA.",

You can, but it doesn't make you less shallow to do so just because you're giving the woman a bit of money. The money SDs give to their SBs is never enough to pay for dignity and respect, yet so many SDs speak disrespectfully about women. Money doesn't make anyone less of a person and it doesn't mean you don't have to hold yourself to a spiritual or personal standard. \n\nYou're right, you don't have to settle. On the other hand, you also shouldn't be someone an SB is settling for because the money is worth it to her. You two both bring equal things to the table, so why should an SB be the only one who takes care of herself, dresses up, is friendly and outgoing and kind if you're only offering money?",

Of the men that would ask for nudes, they do so from women that they would rate a 4 and above.\n\nSecondly you've missed the point entirely. The thought process of a man with means is no different than the thought process of a man without. The difference is options. A man with means has more options available to him in the same way that a conventionally attractive man will have more options available. \n\nThe point is, men will ask for nudes, marry and spend small sums of money on women they find on the lower scale of attractiveness. Your logic originally was that if a man asks for nudes he must find her attractive. That's not at all true. The effort or money a man spends on a woman he isn't in love with is directly proportional to her level of attractiveness.",

They act like johns - and then wonder why all they attract is the sex workers).\n\nThere was another recent post or comment on this sub about how most people are actually ambivalent about their goals. I think it's very true that 90% of the people are probably some degree of ambivalence/flexible with their stated goals, and or have multiple interest/goals that might contradict each other. These are probably also the people who insist on being vague until the other person specifies their interests first.\n\nYou can simultaneously want sex and a relationship, and that's why some men who may genuinely want a real SR with a relationship behave like Johns. I find myself not completely immune to that, as sometimes in ensuring the POT isn't \"platonic\" there's not very many good ways to communicate, and your \"little head\" might take over if there's source of sexual frustration outside of the bowl.\n\nI think for SD's who (hopefully with enough self-awareness) finds themselves meeting this description, its probably better to just actually find their relief elsewhere in more suitable channels to get it out of the way so that frustration does not cloud their judgment/interactions in the bowl.",

What does time mean to her? Is it not a fair trade that you value her time enough to give up something she values equally?\n\nThe problem is some SDs who think that their money entitles them to think badly of others. Not just treat them badly, but think of them badly. Just because you're rich doesn't mean you need to focus solely on beauty or physical desirable traits. You can, but it doesn't make you less shallow to do so just because you're giving the woman a bit of money. The money SDs give to their SBs is never enough to pay for dignity and respect, yet so many SDs speak disrespectfully about women. Money doesn't make anyone less of a person and it doesn't mean you don't have to hold yourself to a spiritual or personal standard. \n\nYou're right, you don't have to settle. On the other hand, you also shouldn't be someone an SB is settling for because the money is worth it to her. You two both bring equal things to the table, so why should an SB be the only one who takes care of herself, dresses up, is friendly and outgoing and kind if you're only offering money?",
