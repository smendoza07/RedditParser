I just wanted to update those who were keeping up with me and the support was so strong, I could definitely use some more. \n\nSD passed away early Saturday morning at 3 am November 14th. \n\nAlthough we were never girlfriend and boyfriend, there was a time where I wanted that with him, but was too scared to move forward with it, and I think he was too. We did exchange i love you\u2019s and expressed how much we cared about each other. But never moved forward, and I can\u2019t help but feel regret in that part. But nonetheless I am BEYOND thankful this man was in my life. He was one of my best friends and always made everything exciting and positive. There were times when we laughed until our stomachs hurt and times where we cried on each other\u2019s shoulders. We were always there for each other. It hurts that I can\u2019t have those special moments with him anymore. This is also the first time I have experienced death with someone so close to me. So it\u2019s hard and I am processing emotions I have never dealt with before. But ultimately I know he would want me to be happy and strong, so I will be that for him. \n\nHaving said that, cherish those you hold close in your heart, because one day they won\u2019t be there anymore. And all you have left are the memories, so make them good ones. Thank you to everyone for their support through this hard moment in my life. But hopefully, I can pass on his kindness to everyone I meet.",

Make sure you properly grieve also, my friends mom passed and she just stuffed everything down and it\u2019s been years and she\u2019s struggling even more. Take time for yourself, reach out to a counselor, take up hobbies, journal, do art even if you\u2019re not good at it, go on walks in nature, read, listen to music and dance in your room, \u201ctalk\u201d to him in your head, tell him how much he means to you. Stay focused on yourself and take time away from activities or gatherings if you need. Stay strong & stay golden girl, you got this!",

You were clearly a very important person in his life so cherish those memories and rest assured that he does too.  Im sure he knew you were there at the hospital and that very likely helped him more than you think.  \n\nThis is a lesson for all of us.  Tell those who are close to you how you feel about them. Dont let there be questions or regrets if something terrible happens.  You never know with certainty that you will see them again.  \n\nIf I may speak for him, thank you for everything you did for him.  Thank you for sharing your love and for being his person.  You made his life so much better by being in it.  Sending you positive vibes to come out of this and get to a place where those raw feelings you have now transition to fond memories that simply make you smile.",
