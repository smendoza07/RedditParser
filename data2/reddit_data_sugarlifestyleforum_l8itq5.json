    "body": "I'm an avid reader of SLF, probably on a daily basis. I love the feelgood stories and I have one to add myself. So here goes...\n\nA while ago I came across a post where The Netherlands was mentioned. Since I'm Dutch I thought I'd send a PM. I've done this a few times before but it has never gone past a couple of messages back and forth unfortunately, but this time I got a quick response and we started talking. We moved to WhatsApp quickly to exchange some pictures and continue our conversation and boy I was in for a surprise: she wasn't only easy to talk to but also absolutely stunning.\nWe started talking about expectations and she said she'd feel more comfortable to take it slow and do several platonic dates before starting anything official. This was fine by me as I do favour the more organic go with the flow approach.\n\nSo we first had our m&g in the city she's studying in (2 hour drive) and have to say she's even more beautiful in real life!\nWe had a great connection from the start and our meet lasted well over 2 hours. Conversation flowed effortlessly and we even shared some cake. I usually wait to share my opinion about m&g's until a little while after but I think we both expressed we would like to see each other again immediately.\n\nSecond date was just dinner in an excellent Italian restaurant (her recommendation) and we had a wonderful time. Just platonic... \n\nThird date... she had a trip to a city near where I live. The last train back home was around 10pm so I offered to pay for a hotel so she didn't have to rush. She agreed. We had dinner in a lively little French bistro and then I gave her the two key cards to the room of the hotel (walking distance from the restaurant).\nAs I was about to walk to my car she invited me to come to the hotel, which I gracefully accepted of course.\nWhen we get to the room we open a small bottle of wine and she sees the wrapped gift I put on the table earlier. After unwrapping she came up to me and kissed me... passionately. I don't think we really stopped kissing for the next 3 hours or so... amazing match on the kissing (physical compatibility is soooo important) . \nI left a bit after midnight and she stayed the night by herself. The next day she visited a museum recommended by me and had a stroll around the city. She texted me some pictures and told me she got home safe. \n\nNow the fourth date. She asked me if I could stay over in her city for the next date, so I booked a nice hotel and made dinner reservations (again her recommendation). Picked her up and had a very nice dinner. She's a very relaxed person to be with. Our conversations are so easy. We complement each other very well. After dinner we walked through the city to get some coffee and she held my arm... now I imagine this is probably why a lot of guys sugardate for. The most beautiful arm candy there is. \n\nThen we made our way to the hotel.\nI won't share any dirty details but we had an extremely great night. We matched on a physical level you can only hope for.\n\nWe had another three amazing dates after that. Unfortunately she chose to pursue a vanilla relationship after this. I must admit there was some heartbreak, but I appreciate the time we spent together and I will cherish the memories of her.",

I have a separate account for non-sugar things and I\u2019ve spoken to many over the years and just made some Internet buddies.\n\nOn this account some SD\u2019s have reached out and I don\u2019t mind talking on here and seeing where it takes us.
