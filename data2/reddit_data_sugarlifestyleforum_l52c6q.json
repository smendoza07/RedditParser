    "body": "I had a M&G with an SD two weeks ago and this past weekend we had our second date no intimacy, but we absolutely hit it off!! He is incredibly sweet, ivy educated and isn\u2019t married (thank god). The best part is, we didn\u2019t even have to discuss the financials he simply threw out a ballpark range and it was right what I was looking for. Another best part is he gave me 2x what I expected for PPM ($XXXX) on our second date!!! I was honestly shocked by his generosity but I really need someone like that in my life and it is a wonderful feeling to have found him especially after months of waiting for the right person. We have similar hobbies, like the same foods and enjoy the same topics. I really lucked out with him, so my message is to those who are still looking. Keep going, you\u2019ll find your charmer :)",
