Then through the years I went short-long until 2019. 2020 until now it\u2019s most mid lenght, but since my thinning is happening quickly, I\u2019m growing out one last time to maintain the buzzcut after.\n\nI was on Minox a little after this pic (2015) until 2019. The density was pretty good, but it was receding slowly. I just got tired of needing to use it for some more years, and accepted to don\u2019t worry about hair.",
