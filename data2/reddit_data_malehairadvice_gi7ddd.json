Just messing with you.\nI had a lot of skin issues particularly in my teens as I'm much older than you...\n\nFinally a dermatologist prescribed me the pharmacy version of retinol. I used it for about 15 years and it's good for wrinkles and such... More than just acne in other words. \n\nI am 54 I think \ud83e\udd14 and no lie it was very cool yesterday a gentleman asked me my age and when I told him he told me I look 35 and he was stunned. \nSitting around the house bored in isolation has done me well LMAO\n\nI've noticed a lot of supplements and vitamins have made a big difference with my skin. It is not the best in the world as yours is but I very seldom have any problem shaving or any bumps anymore at all. Pretty clear face now.\n\n I battled acne for so many years I'm pretty happy with how my face looks now. Knowing what I know now, acne is typically a deficiency of some kind, mainly zinc. And I think your gut microbiome plays a big part along with diet and stress levels.\nNot always true but typically is.",

It is not the best in the world as yours is but I very seldom have any problem shaving or any bumps anymore at all. Pretty clear face now.\n\n I battled acne for so many years I'm pretty happy with how my face looks now. Knowing what I know now, acne is typically a deficiency of some kind, mainly zinc.
