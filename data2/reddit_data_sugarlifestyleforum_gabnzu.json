    "body": "As an SB or an SD there is a lot of pressure in first meets. As a general rule I try to get to know someone fairly well before meeting for the first time. There is a fine line between getting to know someone too much, wasting time texting, and knowing someone so little that you might be risking your life meeting them for the first time. I might eventually write about the getting to know you process, but for now, I'd like to talk about **First Dates**.\n\nI've routinely lamented on this forum about some of the pretty terrible Meet & Greets I've been on. And, truth be told, I find a terrible M&G kind of forgivable. You can walk away afterwards and agree to never meet again. Or, in some cases, you can agree to try again with another platonic (unpaid) date.\n\nNervousness is a very real thing in the bowl, even for those of us that might've been on our fair share of first dates. Things happen that are outside of our control and sometimes you have to have a little leniency. I mean, really, the running joke in this world is that an SB is *always late* and that you should wait at least fifteen minutes before deciding you've been stood up.\n\nI was once stood up on a M&G. Well, at least I thought I was. I was meeting a potential for breakfast. It was about 9am and there was no one in the restaurant save for a few business men having meetings with clients. I arrived early and grabbed a table near the front so my date could spot me coming in the door. About ten minutes before he was due I needed to use the restroom, which was located at the back of the restaurant. I decided even if he came in while I was in the restroom, I'd see him on my way back up front. Guess what? I missed him. I walked right past him and he didn't see me. We both ate separately, assuming we'd been stood up. When I finally texted him (a fairly nasty message might I add) I had paid my bill and was walking away. There was a lot of scrambling and apologies and we eventually met outside and laughed about it later.\n\nEmbarrassing and stressful, but ultimately, forgivable. Right?\n\nSo, what happens when you've made it past the M&G, either with flying colors or with some sort of personal chemistry, and you move onto the intimate date and it just .... bombs?\n\nI see posted here from time to time about how the personal chemistry is off the charts but an SD or SB has moved onto the intimate date and it falls so flat they are at a loss on what to do next. What happened to that chemistry during the first kiss? Or the chemistry you felt when you both locked eyes?\n\nI've had my fair share of intimate dates that fell so far beyond flat that I was pretty sure they weren't redeemable. As an SB I struggle with the intimate date itself and I'm sure many others do as well. There is a difference between having sex with someone that you've met and feel comfortable with and having sex with someone who is providing an allowance and that you barely know. Where do we, as SB's, draw the line on upholding the persona of an SB and being true to ourselves?\n\nIn all honesty, I still probably don't have that figured out.\n\nI always struggle with a first intimate date. I wonder what the person will want or desire in bed. I wonder if my body will look nice enough in the (sometimes) garish light of hotel rooms. I wonder if after working the entire day I'll have the energy to be the perky self that is required for a date. And most of all, I wonder if he'll think it's worth it.\n\nThat's right, after all this time, after every single first date, I still wonder if I was good enough in bed. And sometimes, that fear can be crippling.\n\n**Let's be honest. Not every one of us is a porn star.**\n\nThe shortened courting period of sugar relationships is both beautiful and ugly. It's wonderful to be able to cut the shit out of dating and just get right to the point, but it's also ugly because not truly knowing someone leads us to realize the fragile nature of the connection you've built to that point. This sub alone loves to remind everyone that most relationships don't make it past the first or second intimate date, much less long term. So, do you try to save it, when it starts to fall apart early on?\n\nThe man that I had the snafu with at the restaurant invited me to have our first intimate date a week later. I really enjoyed his company (minus the whole being stood up fiasco) and I was looking forward to moving forward with an arrangement. But, no fail, as the day arrives I find myself frozen with fear. Will he like me naked? Will the sex be good?\n\nTo compensate for this anxiety I over drink on our date, not enough to be drunk but certainly enough to take the edge off. And, lo and behold, my mouth turns dry as hell. I am literally collecting saliva in my mouth for ten straight minutes hoping to god that the poor guy does not notice that I'm giving him an unnaturally long hand job while pursing my lips like I'm sucking on hard candy. I think my eyes were literally crossing. After some time, my nervous and slightly inebriated state decides that I have enough spit to actually do the deed, but what I've collected drips straight out of my mouth as he's going in. I'm on my knees and literally praying that more collects while I'm half assed hoping he mistakes my lipgloss for saliva. He doesn't and eventually he laughs and says, \"This is quite possibly the driest blowjob I've ever gotten. It's like a desert in there.\"\n\nI've, honestly, never been more mortified in my life.\n\nTo flip the narrative, as an SB, what happens when you have great personal chemistry but the sex just bombs for you?\n\nI've seen quite a few SB's on this sub state that they don't care whether they orgasm or not. But plenty of other SB's advise that sexual chemistry is just as important as everything else (allowance included). I'd consider myself one of the latter.\n\nSo what happens when you don't orgasm? What happens when the guy ends up being the worst kisser in the world? Or he has a micro-penis? Or the sex is so god-awful, that if you weren't an SB that's required to just *go with the flow,* you'd tie the poor guy down and give him a proper lesson on the anatomy of the female body.\n\nI had a lovely M&G with a guy and after many weeks of chatting we decided to move forward with an intimate date and an arrangement. Prior to going to our hotel he took me out to an amazing dinner, showered me in attention and plied me with amazing wine. Walking back to the hotel together I didn't feel the usual nervousness or fear that I had earlier in our date. In actuality, I felt empowered. I walked beside this man and I felt, for the first time, like I actually knew what I was doing. I was *so* looking forward to our intimate time.\n\nOf course, in true ironic fashion, we get back to the hotel and the guy just attacks my face. There is slobbery kissing and a lot of forced tongue, whereas previously our traded kisses had been soft and sweet. I try to slow him down as our clothes come off but he gets on top of me and begins his sticky trek down my body with his tongue. Don't get me wrong, I am all for animalistic, dirty sex, but on a first date I want to explore my partner and be explored, not get right down to business all willy nilly. I frantically try to convey this via my mind-meld function and maybe a few halfhearted attempts at direction, but he ignores me and immediately attacks an unknown spot about 2 inches to the left of my clit. The dude is basically sucking on my left labia while intermittently trailing his tongue everywhere. And I mean everywhere. News flash guys, you don't gotta stick the tongue way deep in the vagina like you are spelunking.\n\nEventually, my date gives up on trying to pleasure me that way and decides to flip me over and continue his sticky lickey along my backbone. At this point I am trying to figure out how I can abort mission while remaining completely cool, but alas, I am too late, because he places his hand on my lower back and holds me down while tonguing my ass. At this point in time I am mental noting to mention ass-play is off the books for a first intimate date with all POT's moving forward and praying that a fire drill will require us both to get redressed and exist the building as soon as possible. I am, quite literally, confused. I am wondering what happened to the sweet man I'd made out with earlier, the one with slow sensual kisses and arms that he liked to place around me. I keep willing it to be over soon.\n\nEventually, it is, and we both lay in silence where I succumb to my traumas and pass out for a solid hour. I am wondering if I need to let go of this man that I had such amazing personal chemistry with. I am wondering if, as a good SB, I should be required to act like I'd just had the best sex of my life. At what point in time do you throw off the glamour and sit someone down and say, Man that sucked?\n\nMy advice?\n\n**Every damn time.**\n\nThe thing is, even though this is sugar, it's still a *relationship.* And if all other stars align why throw it away? Why not try again when the newness and nervous is dampened after that first date? I mean, in reality, sometimes it's so bad there is no where to go but up.\n\nI've had sex dates that have gone so subpar that I've once said to an SD, *that wasn't so great, but we can try again. Either it'll get really good or it'll plateau*. His response to me? *Oh baby, I plan to plateau the fuck out of you.*\n\nWith the first guy I mentioned? The one I gave the sandpaper blow job to? I saw him for over 14 months and routinely wrote about him here. After he made his desert joke, I forced a laugh, blamed the wine and asked him to pass me a bottle of water. And then, I drank some, while holding the remainder in my mouth as lubricant. I literally choked when my date said, *That is some Macgyver shit right there.* (Side Tip: Choking produces saliva, too.) We laughed about that first date for many dates after it.\n\nThe second guy? Well, he almost got the can. Walking back to the parking garage after our date we find that the garage he placed my car into closed. At midnight. I was sans vehicle for the evening and stuck at a hotel over an hour uber ride from my home with a guy who'd just deposited his entire stomach contents of saliva onto my body. He offered to call me an uber but I was too let down to give him my address. I couldn't stay in the city because I had to work in less than six hours so I pretended I was going to stay at the hotel. After he departed for his home, I called myself my own uber and paid one fourth of my PPM to get there myself, all the while thinking *Well, that sucked big time*. And then when I got home, I slept on it. I slept on the whole horrible date, my car getting trapped inside the garage, and the terrible horrible sex I'd just had. The next morning, after careful consideration of all the chemistry I'd had up to that point with my date, I agreed to another try.\n\nAnd wouldn't you know, that next date was the best time I've ever had. We spent hours exploring each other's bodies, talking, kissing slowly and sensually (just like I like), and making jokes with each other about random life things. At some points, during the evening, I'd find myself placing both hands on the sides of his face and keeping my lips inches from his to slow him down. We laid there, breathing each others air, our lips inches apart, and he seemed to take my lead. It was, quite honestly, one of the mosts sensual nights of my life.\n\nI'm still with that second guy. We've communicated our likes and dislikes in the bedroom in ways that I've never thought possible. We laugh about that first date now and just recently he confessed how nervous he'd been. That he'd been trying to show me how manly he was and how worldly and knowledgeable in sex he was. I still place my hands on his face before we kiss, but I do it now so I can look into his eyes before our lips touch. And we still sit with our lips inches away from each other but now, it's just so we can feel the electricity crackle between us.\n\nEveryone has nerves. Everyone has fear. Everyone has bad first dates. I know that sugar is supposed to be easy and fun, and it's simple to just move onto the next person, but sometimes... sometimes it's worth trying again. It's worth communicating your desires, even as an SB. These relationships might be transient but they aren't necessarily expendable. You never know what you could find behind that sandpaper blowjob, or that guy tonguing your ass on a first date. Give second chances if you can. We're only human. I'm glad I did.\n\nOh! And happy 8+ months to my ass-tonguing man. I'm sorry I just told Reddit that you suck in bed.",

It could go either way, and just like what people say about interviews, I usually get a hunch within the first 30 seconds whether I like her (or not).  The chances of reversing that first impression only occurs about 10% of the time.   \n\nOne helpful tactic I've used to make the M&G less awkward is I try to have a phone conversation beforehand.  Hearing each other's voices helps with familiarity and gauging chemistry.  Texting / messaging is OK initially, but I usually like to move to one phone conversation prior to meeting up.",
