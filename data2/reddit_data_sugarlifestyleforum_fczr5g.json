    "body": "I met my SD in Nov. and I had an amazing time on our first date. Never thought too much about it. He even  gifted me for coming (which I haven't gotten from any POT SD before). I actually tried to decline his offer because of how fun I had and would've done it regardless of the generous gift but he insisted.\n\nFast forward to now, we are 3 months in, the sex is amazing. He's so kind and caring and very generous. I don't ever ask him for anything but he makes sure I'm taken cared of for whatever it may be. Just recently he offered to pay my rent. I was shook. I've never had anyone offer to do that to me (I'm still relatively new to this whole thing.) He even offered to buy me a plane ticket for my birthday coming up but not with him, but solo (it's a traditional I have with myself to do a solo trip every year) and he fully understood that. We text everyday and he even gave me a spare key to his house. Our time spent together doesn't resolve around sex (however I love it when we do) and he takes me on fun adventurous dates (we are going on a hot air balloon ride soon) and listens to my problems and I listen to his. He sends me poetry and articles to read, and I sometimes come over just to play with his cat and dogs.\n\nI never expected for something like this to go so well, especially with someone who has a very down to Earth personality and makes you not only happy but helps you grow as a person. I can't wait to see where this goes in the future. The age gap is a little significant (I, 21, He, 52) but honestly even without all the generous giving, I could see myself dating this man if our age gap was closer. I know this isn't possible due to him having a daughter around my age and me still having to complete school and potentially starting a family myself (he has his tubes tied so it wouldnt be possible to have a kid). But I'm letting the tides run its course. He gives me a lot of hope for the rest of the male population, but I definitely found myself the ultimate diamond in a sea of gemstones. I truly adore this man, and love how generous and giving he is (not to me but to everyone around him) and it very much inspires me to do the same in ways that I can. Smart. Genuine. Very handsome (that soulful artist kind of attractive). Great listener. Very considerate and compassionate. Amazing music taste. We both share the same dietary restrictions (so eating out and cooking together is a dream come true).  Just had to share this with the internet (I mainly just wanted to brag about him), I couldn't be happier to have met someone so wonderful :) Ugh how did I get so lucky",
