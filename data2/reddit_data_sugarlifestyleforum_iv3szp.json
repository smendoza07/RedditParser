    "body": "Well guys.. \n\n\nTaylor swift landed me a sugar daddy!!!\n\nI met this guy off SA. He messaged me and we eventually moved to texting. It was really easy to talk to him. He seemed excited to talk to me, too. Hes not someone I would normally reach out too, for the fact that he\u2019s only a couple years older than me. However, he did tell me he is also open & poly - which is amazing for me since I\u2019m married and open. I love sharing this part of myself with people, and him being open to it helped me feel more comfortable with being myself. \n\nJust texting we had chemistry. I wanted to see more of him, as he did me, so we eventually moved to Snapchat and though he was shy sending pis,I knew he loved receiving them from me. \n\nOn a normal day, I\u2019m up between 1-4. I don\u2019t have a normal sleep schedule by any means. Thankfully, this worked i my favor when one night when I was up, I was in my garage & accidentally send my him a snap of me smoking my bong, & listening to Taylor swift in the background. \n\nNot realizing I sent it to him - I damn near shit myself when he snapped me back saying that was his favorite song. \n\nHe asked why I was up, & I said I wasn\u2019t a good sleeper. He asked if I was normally awake at this time, & I said yes. He then asked If we could meet up sometime to smoke and listen to Taylor swift albums together since I don\u2019t sleep, and he works 3rd shift. \n\nWe had 3 car dates listening to her album & getting to know each other like two high school kids crushing on each other - sneaking out late at night & making out in the back seat of a parking lot. ( Don\u2019t worry y\u2019all, I had protection - the kind to kill, not the one that protects from pregnancy or STD\u2019s) \n\nEach date better than the last. He\u2019s shy, so adorable and well, I never shut up. Monday we finally made our arrangement mutually beneficial, and LET ME JUST SAY - thank you Taylor swift & Bon Iver. \n\nI can\u2019t wait to see him again!\n\nHere\u2019s a PSA to all the sugar babies out there;\nUNAPOLOGETICALLY BE YOU\n\nSomeone will love you for it",
