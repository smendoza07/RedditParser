    "body": "I\u2019m so tired of it. Had two m&g\u2019s this week. As I usually do with new POts I keep my options open, or try to, so I tentatively set up a date for Friday and Saturday with each of them, with the intent of telling Saturday that I had to cancel if Friday worked out.\n\nBoth the M&G\u2019s seemed to go well, so yesterday comes along and I text in the morning if we are still set...crickets. Text again around 2 for our 6pm meet, she says \u201cI\u2019ll let you know\u201d 5 pm I tell her I need to know, crickets....but extremely typical.\n\nSecond girl, texted last night, nothing, texted this morning, nothing. She lives an hour away, so I\u2019m assuming it isn\u2019t happening.\n\nGirls, and guys, please just grow up and politely say you aren\u2019t interested or made other plans. Doing this sort of thing is so immature.",

They're like you said 5 minutes 15 minutes ago. \"Yeah, but I really mean it this time. You're about to see me walking through the door\" \n\nI was traveling last week and just said fuck it and scheduled two meets on my last night in town honestly expecting one or both to cancel. First one ended up having to push our meeting time back till it was literally right on top of my scheduled m&g with someone else. I just told her to meet me at the same bar I was meeting the other one at and figured worst case scenario I'll just pay everyone and hopefully we'll get along. But the girl who pushed the meet time back, of course, ended up having to cancel because she couldn't get the baby sitter that late. Had a good time with the other girl I met. But my point is you've gotta do what works for you. Make yourself and your wellbeing a priority. Period. No one else is going to do it for you. Don't be rude or totally fuck people over, I'm not advocating that.",

And the excuses are usually lame and repetitive: sick at the last moment, car trouble/accident at the last moment.  I'm thankful when they at least let me know the meet is off, even though I'm certain the excuse is untruthful.  I think younger woman are much more ambivalent about an arrangement, perhaps because of the age differential.  I don't really know.  But woman who are a bit older have been around the block a few times, have had some shitty experiences with age appropriate guys, and are just more appreciative of a mature, nice man who will help them out and indulge them in bed.  Also, when response to texts in unduly delayed, like hours or even the next day, I'm usually loath to meet.  If you can't communicate reliably it's very hard to connect and carry on an ongoing arrangement.  ",

Most times I assume it's because, like many others in the SL, they have multiple POTs and they know some will flake/cancel. They just don't know who. But the problem arises for them when nobody flakes and they have to make the choice (or they find a POT they think is more suited to them). I sometimes wonder in these situations if, unknown to me, the SB has flaked on someone else to see me. You just never know.\n\nSometimes I have chatted about ghosting to SBs. They have all related similar stories happening more than once. They send a polite message to cancel, but in some cases they get abuse back. Now, I don't know how true it is, but even one bad experience can be enough to tip the scales in favour of ghosting. They don't want to step up and cancel so the bad experiences provides a justification based on risk it will happen. Some of things said back to SBs when they cancel has been absolutely appalling. At the same time, some POTs have asked for a reason and I think this triggers a bit of guilt in the SBs. The logic being, the POT hasn't done anything wrong, it's just that they found someone 'better'.  It's much easier just to ignore the possible guilt, or potential for abuse and ghost. I'm not saying I think it is okay to ghost, but I can see why it can happen with some SBs.",

If it turns out ok you can always get dinner after the first drink.... not saying I\u2019m a pro I\u2019ve only met a few guys but none of us would\u2019ve had met if wed made plans to eat dinner first.... I guess one shitty tinder date wasn\u2019t so bad looking back at what it has taught me. At least I\u2019ve never had to drink alone :) ",
