Mine does this cuz I lay my arm over my head. However I have thick curly hair, and I\u2019m imagining yours is far from curly and probably not very thick. It should make it easier to tame that kind of hair though. \n\nClay is the way to go. I use something kinda in between, like a chalky liquid- Kevin Murphy Easy Rider. It definitely gives me the \u201cI woke up like this\u201d even if I showered that day. It\u2019s expensive though. Mousse might work, but I don\u2019t think it would have your shit stay stuck up like that. I wonder what a salt spray would do to you, or any \u201cbeach\u201d products. Again, I\u2019m sorry cuz I have the opposite hair. Pomade will probably work, there are lots of kinds. The oily kind (vo5) worked best for me, a stiff, clay-ish one would I think would be better for you. There are many \u201cAsian men\u2019s hair\u201d videos on YouTube; I\u2019m sure there are a few trying to do what you want.
