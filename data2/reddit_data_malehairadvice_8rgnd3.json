You gotta wax, moisturize, clean, trim, cut it back to where you want it, get rid of small hairs that aren\u2019t supposed to be there without shaving a line out; you gotta consider when you get a haircut if you want your beard longer than your side burns. My mustache holds 2oz if liquid. My soul patch holds around an ounce. I visibly sweat way less because it all just runs off. When you swim the beard hairs sway back and forth. People rub it all the time, it can look amazing, but it takes a lot of effort. That\u2019s without considering having a barber sharpen up your line and trim the whole thing back a half inch once a month, which takes another 20 mins. \nAll in all both are a lot of effort. I definitely recommend a nice electric razor. Saved me so much time, pain, and effort. It just vrooms away and that\u2019s that. Also for body hair X2222! \n\nIf you want to try to grow your beard and have it be more full I\u2019d check out rogain. They make a minidoxil (active ingredient) foaming spray, and regular spray for men\u2019s face. I\u2019d go with the 5% (still aren\u2019t likely to see systemic effects, see rogain effects within 6-10 weeks, and is pretty good bang for buck cause it lasts 2x as long as 2% if you only go once a day). They sell them for 15$ at Walmart. After 8 weeks the hair in my goatee thickened up and came in nicely. Also started filling the patches immediately left and right of the soul patch. For 30$ I have a bitching beard, and puberty should help it finish out for the rest of my life. Best thing I ever splurged on. \n\nI\u2019m high, sorry to ramble, your haircut definitely looks a lot better. Not sure what hair product you use but I could recommend a matte out of bed texturizer, applied when a little bit more than damp, then stretched into position on top when it\u2019s close to drying. This will keep it from frizzing, and gives it a wet \u201cgel\u201d look on the sides, while keeping the top looking like actual hair. \n\nSizzle on my dudes ",

I shave my neck/cheeks daily with a safety razor after showering, trim upper lip usually daily, then beard every 3 days or so.\n\nShaving daily shouldn't take longer than 5 minutes, at a max. Find razor/cream that works with your skin and time it after a shower preferably. You should only have to shave each spot one or two times tops.\n\nCome up your neck toward your chin then go sideways into the contours if needed. If I haven't shaved in two days or more then I reapply cream and do two full passes on the neck. I also change my blade every shave because they're still incredibly cheap and I have very sensitive skin on my neck.\n\nSo much info on the web you could get lost for hours, but you should be able to shave quickly without negative skin effects.

You gotta wax, moisturize, clean, trim, cut it back to where you want it, get rid of small hairs that aren\u2019t supposed to be there without shaving a line out; you gotta consider when you get a haircut if you want your beard longer than your side burns. My mustache holds 2oz if liquid. My soul patch holds around an ounce. I visibly sweat way less because it all just runs off. When you swim the beard hairs sway back and forth. People rub it all the time, it can look amazing, but it takes a lot of effort. That\u2019s without considering having a barber sharpen up your line and trim the whole thing back a half inch once a month, which takes another 20 mins. \nAll in all both are a lot of effort. I definitely recommend a nice electric razor. Saved me so much time, pain, and effort. It just vrooms away and that\u2019s that. Also for body hair X2222! \n\nIf you want to try to grow your beard and have it be more full I\u2019d check out rogain. They make a minidoxil (active ingredient) foaming spray, and regular spray for men\u2019s face. I\u2019d go with the 5% (still aren\u2019t likely to see systemic effects, see rogain effects within 6-10 weeks, and is pretty good bang for buck cause it lasts 2x as long as 2% if you only go once a day). They sell them for 15$ at Walmart. After 8 weeks the hair in my goatee thickened up and came in nicely. Also started filling the patches immediately left and right of the soul patch. For 30$ I have a bitching beard, and puberty should help it finish out for the rest of my life. Best thing I ever splurged on. \n\nI\u2019m high, sorry to ramble, your haircut definitely looks a lot better. Not sure what hair product you use but I could recommend a matte out of bed texturizer, applied when a little bit more than damp, then stretched into position on top when it\u2019s close to drying. This will keep it from frizzing, and gives it a wet \u201cgel\u201d look on the sides, while keeping the top looking like actual hair. \n\nSizzle on my dudes ",

I shave my neck/cheeks daily with a safety razor after showering, trim upper lip usually daily, then beard every 3 days or so.\n\nShaving daily shouldn't take longer than 5 minutes, at a max. Find razor/cream that works with your skin and time it after a shower preferably. You should only have to shave each spot one or two times tops.\n\nCome up your neck toward your chin then go sideways into the contours if needed. If I haven't shaved in two days or more then I reapply cream and do two full passes on the neck. I also change my blade every shave because they're still incredibly cheap and I have very sensitive skin on my neck.\n\nSo much info on the web you could get lost for hours, but you should be able to shave quickly without negative skin effects.

You gotta wax, moisturize, clean, trim, cut it back to where you want it, get rid of small hairs that aren\u2019t supposed to be there without shaving a line out; you gotta consider when you get a haircut if you want your beard longer than your side burns. My mustache holds 2oz if liquid. My soul patch holds around an ounce. I visibly sweat way less because it all just runs off. When you swim the beard hairs sway back and forth. People rub it all the time, it can look amazing, but it takes a lot of effort. That\u2019s without considering having a barber sharpen up your line and trim the whole thing back a half inch once a month, which takes another 20 mins. \nAll in all both are a lot of effort. I definitely recommend a nice electric razor. Saved me so much time, pain, and effort. It just vrooms away and that\u2019s that. Also for body hair X2222! \n\nIf you want to try to grow your beard and have it be more full I\u2019d check out rogain. They make a minidoxil (active ingredient) foaming spray, and regular spray for men\u2019s face. I\u2019d go with the 5% (still aren\u2019t likely to see systemic effects, see rogain effects within 6-10 weeks, and is pretty good bang for buck cause it lasts 2x as long as 2% if you only go once a day). They sell them for 15$ at Walmart. After 8 weeks the hair in my goatee thickened up and came in nicely. Also started filling the patches immediately left and right of the soul patch. For 30$ I have a bitching beard, and puberty should help it finish out for the rest of my life. Best thing I ever splurged on. \n\nI\u2019m high, sorry to ramble, your haircut definitely looks a lot better. Not sure what hair product you use but I could recommend a matte out of bed texturizer, applied when a little bit more than damp, then stretched into position on top when it\u2019s close to drying. This will keep it from frizzing, and gives it a wet \u201cgel\u201d look on the sides, while keeping the top looking like actual hair. \n\nSizzle on my dudes ",

I shave my neck/cheeks daily with a safety razor after showering, trim upper lip usually daily, then beard every 3 days or so.\n\nShaving daily shouldn't take longer than 5 minutes, at a max. Find razor/cream that works with your skin and time it after a shower preferably. You should only have to shave each spot one or two times tops.\n\nCome up your neck toward your chin then go sideways into the contours if needed. If I haven't shaved in two days or more then I reapply cream and do two full passes on the neck. I also change my blade every shave because they're still incredibly cheap and I have very sensitive skin on my neck.\n\nSo much info on the web you could get lost for hours, but you should be able to shave quickly without negative skin effects.

You gotta wax, moisturize, clean, trim, cut it back to where you want it, get rid of small hairs that aren\u2019t supposed to be there without shaving a line out; you gotta consider when you get a haircut if you want your beard longer than your side burns. My mustache holds 2oz if liquid. My soul patch holds around an ounce. I visibly sweat way less because it all just runs off. When you swim the beard hairs sway back and forth. People rub it all the time, it can look amazing, but it takes a lot of effort. That\u2019s without considering having a barber sharpen up your line and trim the whole thing back a half inch once a month, which takes another 20 mins. \nAll in all both are a lot of effort. I definitely recommend a nice electric razor. Saved me so much time, pain, and effort. It just vrooms away and that\u2019s that. Also for body hair X2222! \n\nIf you want to try to grow your beard and have it be more full I\u2019d check out rogain. They make a minidoxil (active ingredient) foaming spray, and regular spray for men\u2019s face. I\u2019d go with the 5% (still aren\u2019t likely to see systemic effects, see rogain effects within 6-10 weeks, and is pretty good bang for buck cause it lasts 2x as long as 2% if you only go once a day). They sell them for 15$ at Walmart. After 8 weeks the hair in my goatee thickened up and came in nicely. Also started filling the patches immediately left and right of the soul patch. For 30$ I have a bitching beard, and puberty should help it finish out for the rest of my life. Best thing I ever splurged on. \n\nI\u2019m high, sorry to ramble, your haircut definitely looks a lot better. Not sure what hair product you use but I could recommend a matte out of bed texturizer, applied when a little bit more than damp, then stretched into position on top when it\u2019s close to drying. This will keep it from frizzing, and gives it a wet \u201cgel\u201d look on the sides, while keeping the top looking like actual hair. \n\nSizzle on my dudes ",
