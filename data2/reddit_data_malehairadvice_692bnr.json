I believe there was a study that showed Asian hair growth to be faster than Caucasian, which was shown to be faster than Black. Also, age, gender, and health obviously will affect growth too. But from what I've read, half inch a month is the go-to average. ",

For example, if someone has half inch long hair to begin with, it can double length in about a month. Each consecutive month, a half inch is going to look like less and less in comparison. \n\nOr it's possible you get a lot of sun and eat very differently in the summer, in which case your hair very well could be growing faster.
