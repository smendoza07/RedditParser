I don\u2019t think BZ went straight up to him and told him to be evil, but I think he might\u2019ve gotten inside his head and caused him to feel more negative emotions towards Hiruzen and the Uchiha. I think Obito either knew/was okay with it because of his own resentments towards his clan and the Leaf. Besides, BZ manipulated generations of Uchiha, I imagine this was just one of his various ways. Not that Danzo is a good person, but if it turned out that Black Zetsu was manipulating him, I could at least somewhat empathize",

On the surface they are but with any real evaluation it's clear that every single one of his actions was meant to put himself forward, and the village second. He didn't care about Konoha. He cared about the title of Hokage and was willing to slaughter thousands to get there. He probably convinces himself he cares about Konoha but his actions betray that.\n\nSakazuki from One Piece and Mustang from FMA are examples of people who have done horrible things to secure what they genuinely consider a righteous future. Whether or not you agree is different, but their actions can at least be argued for. Danzo is straight up shady, cruel, and villainous. He consistently underminded his only \"friend\" and hid away during major attacks to keep himself alive. His stupid actions at the summit nearly destroyed respect for Konoha on a world stage. And his ruthless manipulations let Orochimaru thrive, drove Kabuto and Sasuke crazy, and made a war criminal out of a 14 year old child.\n\nFuck Danzo. (Not saying he's not well-written. He's a good hateable villain. But he isn't grey. He's evil.)",

I think Obito either knew/was okay with it because of his own resentments towards his clan and the Leaf. Besides, BZ manipulated generations of Uchiha, I imagine this was just one of his various ways. Not that Danzo is a good person, but if it turned out that Black Zetsu was manipulating him, I could at least somewhat empathize",

I think Obito either knew/was okay with it because of his own resentments towards his clan and the Leaf. Besides, BZ manipulated generations of Uchiha, I imagine this was just one of his various ways. Not that Danzo is a good person, but if it turned out that Black Zetsu was manipulating him, I could at least somewhat empathize",

When he sees how far Naruto would go for him, he starts to finally listen to Naruto and he realizes maybe someone like Naruto who has changed so many people is the change the system requires.\n\nMaybe he doesn't have to play the villain when there already is a hero.",

That's the first time we see Sasuke think for himself and his resolution is to uproot the system that cause him and his brother so much pain.\n\nBut Sasuke also wants to be loved as much as he denies it. When he sees how far Naruto would go for him, he starts to finally listen to Naruto and he realizes maybe someone like Naruto who has changed so many people is the change the system requires.\n\nMaybe he doesn't have to play the villain when there already is a hero.",
