Sure, he can still kind of pull it off, but the reason he can pull off an unflattering hair cut because HE'S JASON STATHAM. He's not hot *because* of the haircut, but in spite of it. Like, yeah, I'm sure Henry Cavill would still look hot in cargo shorts, a stained hoodie, and a neckbeard too, but that's because he's hot enough that people will overlook the unattractive styling. That doesn't change the general principle that cargo shorts and non-clean-shaven balding heads are not, in and of themselves, attractive.",

Sure, he can still kind of pull it off, but the reason he can pull off an unflattering hair cut because HE'S JASON STATHAM. He's not hot *because* of the haircut, but in spite of it. Like, yeah, I'm sure Henry Cavill would still look hot in cargo shorts, a stained hoodie, and a neckbeard too, but that's because he's hot enough that people will overlook the unattractive styling. That doesn't change the general principle that cargo shorts and non-clean-shaven balding heads are not, in and of themselves, attractive.",

Like, yeah, I'm sure Henry Cavill would still look hot in cargo shorts, a stained hoodie, and a neckbeard too, but that's because he's hot enough that people will overlook the unattractive styling. That doesn't change the general principle that cargo shorts and non-clean-shaven balding heads are not, in and of themselves, attractive.",

Sure, he can still kind of pull it off, but the reason he can pull off an unflattering hair cut because HE'S JASON STATHAM. He's not hot *because* of the haircut, but in spite of it. Like, yeah, I'm sure Henry Cavill would still look hot in cargo shorts, a stained hoodie, and a neckbeard too, but that's because he's hot enough that people will overlook the unattractive styling. That doesn't change the general principle that cargo shorts and non-clean-shaven balding heads are not, in and of themselves, attractive.",

Sure, he can still kind of pull it off, but the reason he can pull off an unflattering hair cut because HE'S JASON STATHAM. He's not hot *because* of the haircut, but in spite of it. Like, yeah, I'm sure Henry Cavill would still look hot in cargo shorts, a stained hoodie, and a neckbeard too, but that's because he's hot enough that people will overlook the unattractive styling. That doesn't change the general principle that cargo shorts and non-clean-shaven balding heads are not, in and of themselves, attractive.",

Sure, he can still kind of pull it off, but the reason he can pull off an unflattering hair cut because HE'S JASON STATHAM. He's not hot *because* of the haircut, but in spite of it. Like, yeah, I'm sure Henry Cavill would still look hot in cargo shorts, a stained hoodie, and a neckbeard too, but that's because he's hot enough that people will overlook the unattractive styling. That doesn't change the general principle that cargo shorts and non-clean-shaven balding heads are not, in and of themselves, attractive.",

Sure, he can still kind of pull it off, but the reason he can pull off an unflattering hair cut because HE'S JASON STATHAM. He's not hot *because* of the haircut, but in spite of it. Like, yeah, I'm sure Henry Cavill would still look hot in cargo shorts, a stained hoodie, and a neckbeard too, but that's because he's hot enough that people will overlook the unattractive styling. That doesn't change the general principle that cargo shorts and non-clean-shaven balding heads are not, in and of themselves, attractive.",
