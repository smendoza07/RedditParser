    "body": "I\u2019m proud new SB\u2019s are on the forum and trying to learn.. but WHY do some wait to apply our advice until it\u2019s too late?? I understand advice can be subjective, but some advice is \u201cno exception until proven otherwise\u201d (for your safety and to avoid scams.) Seasoned SD\u2019s and SB\u2019s are here to help you! We can\u2019t help if you completely ignore our advice, come back & post excuses why you didn\u2019t listen so now you need help or clarification. \n\nI read too many posts lately about new SB\u2019s sending their bank info, sleeping with a POT without an allowance/ppm established, or sending nudes with their face included but haven\u2019t met irl. New SB\u2019s- Please do your homework, take notes and apply it sooner rather than later.",

On the scam thread, you might notice that many of the scams now are written as \"he wants you to buy a google or steam or itunes *or any other card whatsoever for any reason whatsoever*\", \"he wants to have his personal assistant or accountant or lawyer or CFO *or any other person whatsoever* send you your allowance\", etc.\n\nI've had to do that because as SBs came in to the scam thread or DM'ed me directly, and told me they'd been scammed, I found that they often had read the scam thread, **but desperately looked for any possible reason to not consider the scam to apply to them**.  If I didn't name the right card, they decided it wasn't a match.  If it was their butler who was going to send the allowance, and I didn't specifically name butler, then it wasn't a match.  I recently got a DM from someone whose situation exactly, perfectly matched the scam described in the scam thread, but the scammer-SD was a diamond member, and she's not sure if this applies to diamond members.\n\nI am re-thinking my approach of how to get this across.  I never expected how aggressively and overwhelmingly people's various emotional motivations (e.g. desperation) would drive them to find any way to be scammed, victimized, or used for sex, even when they've read clear guidance on how to identify and avoid it.",

I see some basic rules here about scamming and I would sum it up as such:\n\n\"You (SB) are supposed to be paid. If anyone wants you to pay you for something, you are doing it wrong.\"\n\nI was given this advice in high school about human trafficking and looking for jobs abroad. If someone wants YOU to pay to work abroad, then they don't have good intentions. While I can't vouch for possible honest job offers among those, I have certainly never been trafficked.\n\nHowever, you just have to make your peace with the fact that people will always believe stories that are too good to be true.",

I tried so hard to send messages during the week etc., but they would contact me only when they were horny. Now, I heard so many times people saying, \"this is not a real SD\" and blablabla. Really?

I see some basic rules here about scamming and I would sum it up as such:\n\n\"You (SB) are supposed to be paid. If anyone wants you to pay you for something, you are doing it wrong.\"\n\nI was given this advice in high school about human trafficking and looking for jobs abroad. If someone wants YOU to pay to work abroad, then they don't have good intentions. While I can't vouch for possible honest job offers among those, I have certainly never been trafficked.\n\nHowever, you just have to make your peace with the fact that people will always believe stories that are too good to be true.",
