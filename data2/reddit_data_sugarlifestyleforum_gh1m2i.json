    "body": "Thinking back to about 5 years ago and the first long term SB I met through SA. She was a 24 year old single mom of 2 young kids. Worked a full time job in the medical field but still had trouble making ends meet. It was a great feeling to do things like go shopping with her for her kid's birthdays and Christmas, then get \"thank you\" notes and pictures of those kids playing with their new toys. We dated for about 2 years, and are still friends, and I'm still in awe of how fiercely she loves those kids. To all you mamabear SBs out there, this day is for you - hopefully including breakfast in bed and lots of gratitude for what you do!",

Kids aren't easy (I was a picky eater, but also one of those kids who'd try to swallow anything on the floor, and very good at sending myself to the hospital) and it's incredible to me that you guys can manage SRs while also providing love, time and patience to your kids. Sending lots of love and admiration!",
