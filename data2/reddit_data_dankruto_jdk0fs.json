The original manga takes place over about a year (roughly), and :re happens after a two year time skip and takes place over a pretty significant portion of time, though I'm unsure of the exact dates and times. Ishida is amazing. \n\nThe show, however, is the worst pacing disaster I have ever seen in anime. The first season, honestly, follows the manga pretty accurately, just not as pretty or 100% faithful, especially in terms of gore/sexuality/psychology. \n\nSeason 2, while not faithful to the manga and very confusing (as it still requires manga-only knowledge), is still decent in places. And, generally, does tell the major plot points. \n\n:re got a terrible treatment, though. Terrible art, especially considering how perfect the manga is, skips tons of important plot and character beats, makes 0 sense if you've only watched the anime, and tries to make some of the biggest moments memorable but ends up ruining some really deep and wonderful scenes and arcs from the manga. \n\nHeavily recommend reading it! Kinda recommend watching it, since you'll get confused but engrossed by the story and still want to read it. To anyone seeing this, seriously, Ishida is a mastermind.",

The original manga takes place over about a year (roughly), and :re happens after a two year time skip and takes place over a pretty significant portion of time, though I'm unsure of the exact dates and times. Ishida is amazing. \n\nThe show, however, is the worst pacing disaster I have ever seen in anime. The first season, honestly, follows the manga pretty accurately, just not as pretty or 100% faithful, especially in terms of gore/sexuality/psychology. \n\nSeason 2, while not faithful to the manga and very confusing (as it still requires manga-only knowledge), is still decent in places. And, generally, does tell the major plot points. \n\n:re got a terrible treatment, though. Terrible art, especially considering how perfect the manga is, skips tons of important plot and character beats, makes 0 sense if you've only watched the anime, and tries to make some of the biggest moments memorable but ends up ruining some really deep and wonderful scenes and arcs from the manga. \n\nHeavily recommend reading it! Kinda recommend watching it, since you'll get confused but engrossed by the story and still want to read it. To anyone seeing this, seriously, Ishida is a mastermind.",

The original manga takes place over about a year (roughly), and :re happens after a two year time skip and takes place over a pretty significant portion of time, though I'm unsure of the exact dates and times. Ishida is amazing. \n\nThe show, however, is the worst pacing disaster I have ever seen in anime. The first season, honestly, follows the manga pretty accurately, just not as pretty or 100% faithful, especially in terms of gore/sexuality/psychology. \n\nSeason 2, while not faithful to the manga and very confusing (as it still requires manga-only knowledge), is still decent in places. And, generally, does tell the major plot points. \n\n:re got a terrible treatment, though. Terrible art, especially considering how perfect the manga is, skips tons of important plot and character beats, makes 0 sense if you've only watched the anime, and tries to make some of the biggest moments memorable but ends up ruining some really deep and wonderful scenes and arcs from the manga. \n\nHeavily recommend reading it! Kinda recommend watching it, since you'll get confused but engrossed by the story and still want to read it. To anyone seeing this, seriously, Ishida is a mastermind.",

The original manga takes place over about a year (roughly), and :re happens after a two year time skip and takes place over a pretty significant portion of time, though I'm unsure of the exact dates and times. Ishida is amazing. \n\nThe show, however, is the worst pacing disaster I have ever seen in anime. The first season, honestly, follows the manga pretty accurately, just not as pretty or 100% faithful, especially in terms of gore/sexuality/psychology. \n\nSeason 2, while not faithful to the manga and very confusing (as it still requires manga-only knowledge), is still decent in places. And, generally, does tell the major plot points. \n\n:re got a terrible treatment, though. Terrible art, especially considering how perfect the manga is, skips tons of important plot and character beats, makes 0 sense if you've only watched the anime, and tries to make some of the biggest moments memorable but ends up ruining some really deep and wonderful scenes and arcs from the manga. \n\nHeavily recommend reading it! Kinda recommend watching it, since you'll get confused but engrossed by the story and still want to read it. To anyone seeing this, seriously, Ishida is a mastermind.",
