    "body": "I've seen a lot of these posts this year, enough that I've finally decided to say something about it. \nThere's a lot of sugar babies who agreed to be monogamous with their sugar daddy, only to break that rule and get or keep a boyfriend, or get other sugar daddies. They do it all behind the SD's back while lying to his face that they're being monogamous, and then they're all upset when the relationship ends and they're no longer getting their money. Sometimes they're desperately asking how to get him back because they were dependent on the money.\nLook, a sugar relationship is an arrangement built on trust and on agreed-upon rules. Just be honest with your sugar daddy about how you feel and what you are and aren't willing to do. Otherwise it's a relationship based on lies, and you're just  treating your sugar daddy as an ATM. You know it's true. Treating a sugar daddy as an ATM and lying to keep that arrangement is no better than men treating women as bodies and lying to fuck them. You're objectifying your sugar daddies when you treat them this way. There are sugar daddies out there who don't care if you're monogamous, if it's important to you not to be, then find them.\n\nI find it extra ironic when the ones posting it are the SB's who look down on married SD's. Like, you won't even be monogamous on your short relationship where you're getting thousands of dollars and getting to have sex and a guy adoring you and all these gifts, yet you want to look down on an SD who Isn't getting money and is living with a dead sexless bedroom and is only staying because he loves his wife, or for the kids and because he doesn't want to destroy his family. I feel like these sugar babies need to look at their own ethics.\n\nIdk. That's all I have to say, I guess. You're free to debate me, but I feel like sugar relationships are supposed to be built on mutually agreed to rules and trust.",

Then I found a SD that asked me for exclusivity. He's married, and he already managed to have sex with both of us, that was funny but she (his wife) hated me after that. That's our deal, he can have both of us, and I'm his alone, and when I want to have sex with more men, I'll end our deal first.",

I agree with you that\n\n> the need to feel connected with and wanted by someone you are actually attracted to is very powerful.\n\nSome SDs' delusions about the *actually attracted* part seem to be the core of the problem you are describing -- not age. An age gap doesn't proclude actual attraction. I have been with my (sugar) boyfriend for three and a half years and I've long lost all desire to have sex with anybody else. Our age gap of 15 years doesn't change that. We are a normal couple (an amazing one I think).",

Married SDs aren't really available to have more long-term or in-depth arrangements whereas single SDs have the room in their life.\n\nYes, of course, there are those guys who are in the \"kid in a candy store\" phase - that happens with both married and divorced SDs when they first start out.  Some SDs remain permantly stuck in that sort of phase.\n\nIn contrast, there are plenty of divorced SDs who are looking for a lot more.

The couple of women I've dated wanted to get too serious too fast and didnt end well. I don't want to hurt or mislead anyone, but I still want the companionship, and intimacy, of a woman.\n\nand another SD who talked of moving on from his \"kid in a candy store\" phase:-\n\n>Stage 3: As I further progressed, I realized that what I really wanted was to have sex and socialize with just one younger, more beautiful woman who I also really truly liked, and who also truly liked me, especially without the attachments of a vanilla LTR, but I welcomed some strings attached and emotional intimacy.\n\nI rather think that it is divorced SDs who are more likely to be looking for companionship and emotional intimacy rather than just \"playing the field\".",

On the flip side, I have developed defined boundaries while sugaring than I ever did vanilla dating, so it\u2019s not all bad. I bet your experience was built upon your dating history in your 20s even if it was bad, you know better now.

In doing so, they lean heavily on the \"relationship\" concept to try to isolate and control these girls.\n\nThen, when someone like me comes along and points out the obvious absurdity of their expectations, they suddenly switch gears and sound like contract lawyers, talking about the terms of their agreements in a very clinical manner.  Apparently the obvious inconsistencies in these differing behaviors don't register with them. \ud83d\ude06\n\nThe mental gymnastics they go through to justify their controlling behavior is truly a sight to behold, lol.",

She's just going to end up with very short sugar flings, which aren't stable and can create unhealthy views of men, relationships, and herself. Men aren't stupid. They can sense a lack of attraction. That's normally when they go out looking for someone who's more into them.

I never said that you need to be wholely wrapped up in each other to the point you have no life of your own. What you're describing is a normal relationship, which is what this should be. It just has added caveats to it, which are agreed to beforehand by both parties. Even SRs with ages closer together, like mine, have that expiry date. I'm 46 and my SC are only a handful of years older.\n\nAgain, the issue here is less about age gaps & money and mostly about basic respect.

About a year ago, my SB asked me to get off of Seeking and be monogamous with her.  I was shocked by the request and was a bit flattered.  But it was all a scam to extract more allowance and gifts from me.  Within a month, she was flying to her hometown of Austin to see past SDs.  Within two months, after getting burned by a bartender at a rave that pumped and dumped her, she got a boyfriend.  All of this soap opera occurred while she was ostensible monogamous with me.  She was totally duplicitous.",

Whether it be marriage or arrangement, I think forcing those sorts of promises from people is inherently flawed. If people want exclusivity, then they need to do the work themselves to remove the need in the other person to Stray.\n\nMy issue is that you assert that an older guy is less worthy of respect than the younger guy when it comes to trust. That it is okay to disrespect an old guy, simply because he isn\u2019t 20 something. If you make a promise that is dependent upon how much you respect the other person then that is a reflection of your own honour and your word becomes meaningless. \n\nRegarding age:\n\nPlacing more value on a young guy, because he has potential versus an older guy who is a proven commodity, is not intrinsically the best view.\n\nYouthful desires are valid. As aSD I can\u2019t behoove her for listing after youth. But I would argue that the sugar is better suited to age gap relationships where the young person values maturity, over youthful appearance. To say that sugar is purely about the money is to basically admit that it\u2019s all prostitution and for a large percentage of people (perhaps not the majority) that is not the case.",

An exclusive SD who supports them financially and \"allows\" them to live their own lives is something special.

The reason being, I have had vasectomy and I show them my results. \n\nI have been seeing a girl for over an year and stopped using condoms. I ask her every time before we get intimate if she wants me to use a condom. I get tested every six months and I asked her to get tested too.

You just feel like if you admitted to it, you would have to admit to being wrong, and you wouldn't be able to feel self-righteous in looking down on married SD's.\n\nIn one case, it's a case of someone using another, and lying so they can continue to do so, when they could just go get a different sugar daddy. In the married SD case, it's a case of trying to keep a family together while getting what he needs in order to be a fulfilled and emotionally stable person.\n\nYou're right that I don't judge married SD's for sugardating. I'd prefer it be an open relationship or a DADT situation, but whether it can be depends on the wife and is out of their hands if they have one that isn't ok with it. I understand when they sugardate and don't inform their wives.\n\nBecause I understand that in many cases, these married SD's are in a dead-bedroom relationship, and either working through the divorce process, or are staying in the relationship so they don't destroy their family. There are situations where they're staying because their wife is financially dependent on them, or they stay because of the kids, or because they love their wife. \n\nI understand that in many cases, these men are depressed and miserable because of dead bedrooms and a lack of intimacy and affection. I understand that people wither when they feel unloved and aren't getting intimacy. I understand that it's difficult for them to stay emotionally supportive and be emotionally available for their family or wife when they feel like they're pouring from an empty cup because no one is pouring into theirs.\n\nI understand that sugardating often gives them what they need, and allows them to fill their cup and be more emotionally stable and better able to be there for their family. I understand that in some cases, it's sugardating that Saves the marriage. And they can't leave their marriage or be open about seeing others without destroying a family.\n\nThat's entirely different from an SB lying so she can keep getting money from an SD when she could literally just pick a different SD who's fine with her seeing others. \n\nIt's not hypocritical, because I do feel that these sugar daddies should be honest with their sugar babies that they have a wife.\n\nOn the other hand, they do have a lot more to lose if the sugar baby decides to break discretion for revenge or blackmail, so it doesn't surprise me that some choose to keep their marriage secret.",

I discourage it and think they should be honest about being married, though I understand fears of consequences, and I definitely discourage them claiming to only have one sugar baby if they have multiple. I showed the difference between a man sugardating because he has a dead bedroom but doesn't want to destroy his family, and a sugar baby lying about seeing others so she can keep using her sugar daddy as an ATM. And I've seen posts from sugar babies in sugar baby only groups where they boast about having multiple sugar daddies and lying to them so they can get more money, moreover, encouraging others to do it. There's a difference between intentionally using people, and someone just trying to get a little intimacy in their life.\n\nBut it's great to know you're the kind of man who doesn't respect women unless they think the way you want them to.",

Don't put words in my mouth.\n\nShe's not obligated to give him intimacy. \nHe's not obligated to forever go without intimacy or never get his own needs met. \nNeither of them are obligated to make sure the other is happy. That's everyone's own problem to deal with themselves. \nIf a man is not getting intimacy, that's his problem to figure out, without putting the burden on his wife. \nThat is what these men do. \nI don't know why you're attacking me over it.

There's no consequence, other than perhaps the lapse of time between breaking off and getting a new one.\n\nI expect sugar daddies to do the exact same thing in regards to their sugar babies. They should communicate if their needs aren't being met, and break things off and find another sugar baby if nothing changes. No biggie.\n\nWhy don't I expect married SD's to do the same?\n\n-married men are (usually) in longer relationships than sugar relationships\n\n-breaking off the marriage can destroy the family\n\n-sometimes the wife is financially dependent on the man, and ending things would fuck her over\n\n-there's the whole \"divorce will hurt the kids\" \n\n-there's the stress of getting new living arrangements, and possibly the stress of having to get a lawyer and figure out what belongs to who\n\n-there's the fact that usually married men love their wives and intend to be with them forever, whereas sugardating is intended and understood to be temporary\n\n\nSo no, it's Not the same thing. A sugar baby or sugar daddy could easily just end the sugar relationship and get another sugar partner. \n\nSugar babies are Usually not married, and if they Were married and were sugardating to bring in money to save the house or to get intimacy and meet needs their partner couldn't? \nI would be understanding of it, just like I am with the married men.\n\nI'm not the one being inconsistent.

I've seen people walk away from *millions* because they had a dream and wanted a *chance* at a family (that they didn't have yet.)

If I offered to sell you Gucci for a few dollars... who is the fool in that transaction? \n\nPlease hold rich dudes to a higher standard. If they are as naive as you assert, they dont deserve to be rich. \n\nI am sorry I was mean to you, a fellow who appears to despise Republicans and I'm guess is west coast.

You can just tell him what you told us here today. \n\nAgain, my issue here is not married SDs or cheating. It\u2019s you making a distinction between two wrongs when it\u2019s all equally wrong.

So I am speaking from the understandings that have been given me. I'm sure there are ones who are Not in dead bedrooms and could have great sex with their wife and cheat just because they want to, but unless I've been lied to or had a poor sample, that's not the majority.\n\nThe reason why I take issue with SB's not upholding their monogamous sugardating agreement is because I have seen some talk about their sugar daddies like just ATMs to use and discuss having multiple and lying about monogamy to get as much money as they can. Some even encourage others to cheat.  I understand needing to meet needs, but I'm against the idea of dehumanizing and using others to do so.\n\nIf I saw posts or comments from guys pretending to be monogamous with sugar babies so they can raw dog as many girls as they can, I would be against that as well.

I\u2019m not out here to hurt anyone and I don\u2019t rely on any SD for income versus enhancement. It\u2019s hard to see someone seeking monogamy when I feel like the whole reason we are both here- to free some part of us that feels confined- means that now one or both of us has to fit a square peg in a round hole and cut off some part of us to make it work. \nWhatever kind of dating you do, you\u2019re only setting yourself up to get hurt if you\u2019re a monogamous person who is seeking monogamy and settling to be with someone who isn\u2019t about that just because you like them/they\u2019re hot/a good lay.",

If the SB 's conditions  on seeing him were  that he not have any other SBs who may take away from her $ pot and she found out then she would be within her right to be pissed if she found out. Especially if said SD had turned her down buying Gucci bag the other day cuz of some budget issue or something and she found out somehow that he was spending his $ instead on a different girl gifting the side SB a Chanel bag and a new car and that's why he had budget issues that month.  I'm pretty sure that would upset Sbs. I wouldn't fault her if she said \"FU or I won't forgive but a paid trip to Hawaii for me and my bestie for me to think about forgiving you might go a long way to me forgiving you\" lol\n\nI had incident when a SB (who asked me to be monogamous and was the one who brought it up early on ) had been acting shady and I asked her about this dude she had been hanging with him. Even gave her a chance to come out with it but she accused me of being jealous and paranoid.  Funny thing a month later \"my paranoia \" must have been so strong that it manifested her to confess she is pregnant by her drug dealing \"friend\" with 8 other baby mamas. That's not an exaggeration either.  She was crying on FaceTime and I just was chill because well I could tell she was lying. Any amateur poker player could read her tells as if flashing on a neon sign. \n\nI don't expect a SB to practice monogamy with me and so I don't make it part of the agreement.  I have done it before but not for some time now. Funny thing sometimes the girl will make it known that \"I'm not sleeping with anyone else.\" I tell them \"I don't care if you do but will care that you lie to me especially when I never required a situation to lie about it. Now I will hold you to that and I won't take it well if you are lying. Reason being lack of trust now and doubt is introduced into our bowl.\" \n\nSB is supposed to expect consistency from me and I expect the same and no lying nor obfuscation of pertinent facts to our arrangement. Not all men treat their SBs as sex objects and not all SBs treat their men as ATMs. Some of the stories I read make me think \" Dam ..I gotta get one like her!\" And some make me cringe on the behavior or mentality being expressed and garner no sympathy for them. Their SD definitely lol. \n\nThe energy you give is reflected back on you.",

And that's what we have a lot on a sugar sub. I agree with you that\n\n> the need to feel connected with and wanted by someone you are actually attracted to is very powerful.\n\nSome SDs' delusions about the *actually attracted* part seem to be the core of the problem you are describing -- not age. An age gap doesn't proclude actual attraction. I have been with my (sugar) boyfriend for three and a half years and I've long lost all desire to have sex with anybody else. Our age gap of 15 years doesn't change that. We are a normal couple (an amazing one I think).",

I guess it does make sense though because single SDs have the freedom to play the field more easily than married men.\n\nIf anything, I'd say it's probably the other way round.  Married SDs aren't really available to have more long-term or in-depth arrangements whereas single SDs have the room in their life.\n\nYes, of course, there are those guys who are in the \"kid in a candy store\" phase - that happens with both married and divorced SDs when they first start out.  Some SDs remain permantly stuck in that sort of phase.\n\nIn contrast, there are plenty of divorced SDs who are looking for a lot more.  If I may, I will quote a couple of SDs who are/were regular posters here:-\n\nAn SD who started after his divorce:-\n\n>Since my marriage ended I have not been interested in or capable of anything serious. The couple of women I've dated wanted to get too serious too fast and didnt end well. I don't want to hurt or mislead anyone, but I still want the companionship, and intimacy, of a woman.\n\nand another SD who talked of moving on from his \"kid in a candy store\" phase:-\n\n>Stage 3: As I further progressed, I realized that what I really wanted was to have sex and socialize with just one younger, more beautiful woman who I also really truly liked, and who also truly liked me, especially without the attachments of a vanilla LTR, but I welcomed some strings attached and emotional intimacy.\n\nI rather think that it is divorced SDs who are more likely to be looking for companionship and emotional intimacy rather than just \"playing the field\".",

In doing so, they lean heavily on the \"relationship\" concept to try to isolate and control these girls.\n\nThen, when someone like me comes along and points out the obvious absurdity of their expectations, they suddenly switch gears and sound like contract lawyers, talking about the terms of their agreements in a very clinical manner.  Apparently the obvious inconsistencies in these differing behaviors don't register with them. \ud83d\ude06\n\nThe mental gymnastics they go through to justify their controlling behavior is truly a sight to behold, lol.",

She's just going to end up with very short sugar flings, which aren't stable and can create unhealthy views of men, relationships, and herself. Men aren't stupid. They can sense a lack of attraction. That's normally when they go out looking for someone who's more into them.

I never said that you need to be wholely wrapped up in each other to the point you have no life of your own. What you're describing is a normal relationship, which is what this should be. It just has added caveats to it, which are agreed to beforehand by both parties. Even SRs with ages closer together, like mine, have that expiry date. I'm 46 and my SC are only a handful of years older.\n\nAgain, the issue here is less about age gaps & money and mostly about basic respect.

I really do care about her, and I'm not the possessive type.\n\nBut the OP has an extremely high emotional IQ and a remarkable level of integrity to write this refreshingly truthful piece of reddit.  About a year ago, my SB asked me to get off of Seeking and be monogamous with her.  I was shocked by the request and was a bit flattered.  But it was all a scam to extract more allowance and gifts from me.  Within a month, she was flying to her hometown of Austin to see past SDs.  Within two months, after getting burned by a bartender at a rave that pumped and dumped her, she got a boyfriend.  All of this soap opera occurred while she was ostensible monogamous with me.  She was totally duplicitous.",

Whether it be marriage or arrangement, I think forcing those sorts of promises from people is inherently flawed. If people want exclusivity, then they need to do the work themselves to remove the need in the other person to Stray.\n\nMy issue is that you assert that an older guy is less worthy of respect than the younger guy when it comes to trust. That it is okay to disrespect an old guy, simply because he isn\u2019t 20 something. If you make a promise that is dependent upon how much you respect the other person then that is a reflection of your own honour and your word becomes meaningless. \n\nRegarding age:\n\nPlacing more value on a young guy, because he has potential versus an older guy who is a proven commodity, is not intrinsically the best view.\n\nYouthful desires are valid. As aSD I can\u2019t behoove her for listing after youth. But I would argue that the sugar is better suited to age gap relationships where the young person values maturity, over youthful appearance. To say that sugar is purely about the money is to basically admit that it\u2019s all prostitution and for a large percentage of people (perhaps not the majority) that is not the case.",

A sugar daddy lying to his wife he's lived with for years that he's sugardating, so that he doesn't destroy his family, is Not the same as a sugar baby lying to her sugardaddy that she's known for a short time, so she can keep using him as an ATM.\n\nThey're two entirely different situations and you know it. You just feel like if you admitted to it, you would have to admit to being wrong, and you wouldn't be able to feel self-righteous in looking down on married SD's.\n\nIn one case, it's a case of someone using another, and lying so they can continue to do so, when they could just go get a different sugar daddy. In the married SD case, it's a case of trying to keep a family together while getting what he needs in order to be a fulfilled and emotionally stable person.\n\nYou're right that I don't judge married SD's for sugardating. I'd prefer it be an open relationship or a DADT situation, but whether it can be depends on the wife and is out of their hands if they have one that isn't ok with it. I understand when they sugardate and don't inform their wives.\n\nBecause I understand that in many cases, these married SD's are in a dead-bedroom relationship, and either working through the divorce process, or are staying in the relationship so they don't destroy their family. There are situations where they're staying because their wife is financially dependent on them, or they stay because of the kids, or because they love their wife. \n\nI understand that in many cases, these men are depressed and miserable because of dead bedrooms and a lack of intimacy and affection. I understand that people wither when they feel unloved and aren't getting intimacy. I understand that it's difficult for them to stay emotionally supportive and be emotionally available for their family or wife when they feel like they're pouring from an empty cup because no one is pouring into theirs.\n\nI understand that sugardating often gives them what they need, and allows them to fill their cup and be more emotionally stable and better able to be there for their family. I understand that in some cases, it's sugardating that Saves the marriage. And they can't leave their marriage or be open about seeing others without destroying a family.\n\nThat's entirely different from an SB lying so she can keep getting money from an SD when she could literally just pick a different SD who's fine with her seeing others.\n\nIt's not hypocritical, because do feel that these sugar daddies should be honest with their sugar babies that they have a wife.\n\nOn the other hand, they do have a lot more to lose if the sugar baby decides to break discretion for revenge or blackmail, so it doesn't surprise me that some choose to keep their marriage secret.",

I discourage it and think they should be honest about being married, though I understand fears of consequences, and I definitely discourage them claiming to only have one sugar baby if they have multiple. I showed the difference between a man sugardating because he has a dead bedroom but doesn't want to destroy his family, and a sugar baby lying about seeing others so she can keep using her sugar daddy as an ATM. And I've seen posts from sugar babies in sugar baby only groups where they boast about having multiple sugar daddies and lying to them so they can get more money, moreover, encouraging others to do it. There's a difference between intentionally using people, and someone just trying to get a little intimacy in their life.\n\nBut it's great to know you're the kind of man who doesn't respect women unless they think the way you want them to.",

Someone who felt the need to get on their soapbox to criticize SBs that violate their monogamous agreement with their SD would have been fine until OP decided to defend the married SDs. Like you said, there are a myriad of reasons why someone cheats (some more sympathetic than others) but somehow she decided to defend all married SDs and cast blame on the wives \u2014that shit was wild to read. \ud83d\ude02 I agree, none of it matters in an agreement between an SB/SD. No one brought it up but OP who decided to write a thesis and naturally people will debate this hypocritical take as it is a thread. That\u2019s where we are right now.",

There's no consequence, other than perhaps the lapse of time between breaking off and getting a new one.\n\nI expect sugar daddies to do the exact same thing in regards to their sugar babies. They should communicate if their needs aren't being met, and break things off and find another sugar baby if nothing changes. No biggie.\n\nWhy don't I expect married SD's to do the same?\n\n-married men are (usually) in longer relationships than sugar relationships\n\n-breaking off the marriage can destroy the family\n\n-sometimes the wife is financially dependent on the man, and ending things would fuck her over\n\n-there's the whole \"divorce will hurt the kids\" \n\n-there's the stress of getting new living arrangements, and possibly the stress of having to get a lawyer and figure out what belongs to who\n\n-there's the fact that usually married men love their wives and intend to be with them forever, whereas sugardating is intended and understood to be temporary\n\n\nSo no, it's Not the same thing. A sugar baby or sugar daddy could easily just end the sugar relationship and get another sugar partner. \n\nSugar babies are Usually not married, and if they Were married and were sugardating to bring in money to save the house or to get intimacy and meet needs their partner couldn't? \nI would be understanding of it, just like I am with the married men.\n\nI'm not the one being inconsistent. You're just trying to measure two things that aren't the same and don't have nearly the same consequences.",

I understand needing to meet needs, but I'm against the idea of dehumanizing and using others to do so.\n\nIf I saw comments from guys pretending to be monogamous with sugar babies so they could fuck as many girls as they could, I would be against that as well.

You realize cheating destroys families, not divorce, right? Cheating is the precursor to divorce. Girl, I hope you keep these reasonings in mind if you ever find your husband cheating. You can just tell him what you told us here today. \n\nAgain, my issue here is not married SDs or cheating. It\u2019s you making a distinction between two wrongs when it\u2019s all equally wrong.

So I am speaking from the understandings that have been given me. I'm sure there are ones who are Not in dead bedrooms and could have great sex with their wife and cheat just because they want to, but unless I've been lied to or had a poor sample, that's not the majority.\n\nThe reason why I take issue with SB's not upholding their monogamous sugardating agreement is because I have seen some talk about their sugar daddies like just ATMs to use and discuss having multiple and lying about monogamy to get as much money as they can. Some even encourage others to cheat.  I understand needing to meet needs, but I'm against the idea of dehumanizing and using others to do so.\n\nIf I saw posts or comments from guys pretending to be monogamous with sugar babies so they can raw dog as many girls as they can, I would be against that as well. Perhaps I should have mentioned that on my main post, maybe then people wouldn't be attacking me so much",

You\u2019ve not heard from their wives, and you don\u2019t have a complete picture, but you naively think you do. Your SD could be telling the truth or lying; it doesn\u2019t matter.

I guess it does make sense though because single SDs have the freedom to play the field more easily than married men.\n\nIf anything, I'd say it's probably the other way round.  Married SDs aren't really available to have more long-term or in-depth arrangements whereas single SDs have the room in their life.\n\nYes, of course, there are those guys who are in the \"kid in a candy store\" phase - that happens with both married and divorced SDs when they first start out.  Some SDs remain permantly stuck in that sort of phase.\n\nIn contrast, there are plenty of divorced SDs who are looking for a lot more.  If I may, I will quote a couple of SDs who are/were regular posters here:-\n\nAn SD who started after his divorce:-\n\n>Since my marriage ended I have not been interested in or capable of anything serious. The couple of women I've dated wanted to get too serious too fast and didnt end well. I don't want to hurt or mislead anyone, but I still want the companionship, and intimacy, of a woman.\n\nand another SD who talked of moving on from his \"kid in a candy store\" phase:-\n\n>Stage 3: As I further progressed, I realized that what I really wanted was to have sex and socialize with just one younger, more beautiful woman who I also really truly liked, and who also truly liked me, especially without the attachments of a vanilla LTR, but I welcomed some strings attached and emotional intimacy.\n\nI rather think that it is divorced SDs who are more likely to be looking for companionship and emotional intimacy rather than just \"playing the field\".",

It would actually be laughable if it wasn't so disturbing.\n\nThey start by claiming shock and using words like \"hurt\" and \"betrayal\" when girls less than half their ages **inevitably** fail to resist the urge to date boys their own age.  In doing so, they lean heavily on the \"relationship\" concept to try to isolate and control these girls.\n\nThen, when someone like me comes along and points out the obvious absurdity of their expectations, they suddenly switch gears and sound like contract lawyers, talking about the terms of their agreements in a very clinical manner.  Apparently the obvious inconsistencies in these differing behaviors don't register with them. \ud83d\ude06\n\nThe mental gymnastics they go through to justify their controlling behavior is truly a sight to behold, lol.",

I never said that you need to be wholely wrapped up in each other to the point you have no life of your own. What you're describing is a normal relationship, which is what this should be. It just has added caveats to it, which are agreed to beforehand by both parties. Even SRs with ages closer together, like mine, have that expiry date. I'm 46 and my SC are only a handful of years older.\n\nAgain, the issue here is less about age gaps & money and mostly about basic respect. We put our cards on the table to avoid all the lying and uncertainty. It actually creates much stronger relationships.",

Whether it be marriage or arrangement, I think forcing those sorts of promises from people is inherently flawed.

That it is okay to disrespect an old guy, simply because he isn\u2019t 20 something. If you make a promise that is dependent upon how much you respect the other person then that is a reflection of your own honour and your word becomes meaningless. \n\nRegarding age:\n\nPlacing more value on a young guy, because he has potential versus an older guy who is a proven commodity, is not intrinsically the best view.\n\nYouthful desires are valid. As aSD I can\u2019t behoove her for listing after youth. But I would argue that the sugar is better suited to age gap relationships where the young person values maturity, over youthful appearance. To say that sugar is purely about the money is to basically admit that it\u2019s all prostitution and for a large percentage of people (perhaps not the majority) that is not the case.",

No biggie.\n\nWhy don't I expect married SD's to do the same?\n\n-married men are (usually) in longer relationships than sugar relationships\n\n-breaking off the marriage can destroy the family\n\n-sometimes the wife is financially dependent on the man, and ending things would fuck her over\n\n-there's the whole \"divorce will hurt the kids\" \n\n-there's the stress of getting new living arrangements, and possibly the stress of having to get a lawyer and figure out what belongs to who\n\n-there's the fact that usually married men love their wives and intend to be with them forever, whereas sugardating is intended and understood to be temporary\n\n\nSo no, it's Not the same thing. A sugar baby or sugar daddy could easily just end the sugar relationship and get another sugar partner. \n\nSugar babies are Usually not married, and if they Were married and were sugardating to bring in money to save the house or to get intimacy and meet needs their partner couldn't? \nI would be understanding of it, just like I am with the married men.\n\nI'm not the one being inconsistent.

Some even encourage others to cheat, or to charge for monogamy they don't actually do.  I understand needing to meet needs, but I'm against the idea of dehumanizing and using others to do so.\n\nIf I saw comments from guys pretending to be monogamous with sugar babies so they could fuck as many girls as they could, I would be against that as well. Maybe I should have mentioned that on my main post, and then you wouldn't be attacking me.",

Hell if anything because the consequences of an SD lying to his married wife is higher, then the lie is worse. Why do you expect SBs/SDs to communicate but not two married folks? You realize cheating destroys families, not divorce, right? Cheating is the precursor to divorce. Girl, I hope you keep these reasonings in mind if you ever find your husband cheating. You can just tell him what you told us here today. \n\nAgain, my issue here is not married SDs or cheating. It\u2019s you making a distinction between two wrongs when it\u2019s all equally wrong.

So I am speaking from the understandings that have been given me. I'm sure there are ones who are Not in dead bedrooms and could have great sex with their wife and cheat just because they want to, but unless I've been lied to or had a poor sample, that's not the majority.\n\nThe reason why I take issue with SB's not upholding their monogamous sugardating agreement is because I have seen some talk about their sugar daddies like just ATMs to use and discuss having multiple and lying about monogamy to get as much money as they can. Some even encourage others to cheat.  I understand needing to meet needs, but I'm against the idea of dehumanizing and using others to do so.\n\nIf I saw posts or comments from guys pretending to be monogamous with sugar babies so they can raw dog as many girls as they can, I would be against that as well.

On the flip side, I have developed defined boundaries while sugaring than I ever did vanilla dating, so it\u2019s not all bad. I bet your experience was built upon your dating history in your 20s even if it was bad, you know better now. I feel like sugaring can stunt you in some ways if that\u2019s the bulk of your relationships. I feel the exact same way when young guys come into this sub asking for advice on how to be an SD.",

By SLF\u2019s standards I personally shouldn\u2019t have a dog in this fight, but I\u2019ve had success in the bowl and I find the discourse here interesting.

She's just going to end up with very short sugar flings, which aren't stable and can create unhealthy views of men, relationships, and herself. Men aren't stupid. They can sense a lack of attraction. That's normally when they go out looking for someone who's more into them.

I never said that you need to be wholely wrapped up in each other to the point you have no life of your own. What you're describing is a normal relationship, which is what this should be. It just has added caveats to it, which are agreed to beforehand by both parties. Even SRs with ages closer together, like mine, have that expiry date. I'm 46 and my SC are only a handful of years older.\n\nAgain, the issue here is less about age gaps & money and mostly about basic respect.

If a person has needs I cannot meet, then I enjoy the short time we have, thank them, and move on. This is the most basic of manners & respect.

Throughout our entire marriage, her libido kept going up. She was *insatiable* in her early and mid 40-s. Much more so than in her 20-s and 30-s. This is very common.\n\nEarly 20-something girls are perfectly capable of going without sex for months. Not every 20-something girl has a BF or is hooking up constantly. And they do it without being paid. \n\nIf they are capable of doing THAT, surely it can't be that difficult to stick to an exclusivity agreement with their SD. It's just a matter of being respectful and honest.",

Historically, it was not even legally considered theft if it was only theft to satisfy basic needs.\n\nSo, I agree it's shitty behavior, but we should still take the situation into account.",

Whether it be marriage or arrangement, I think forcing those sorts of promises from people is inherently flawed. If people want exclusivity, then they need to do the work themselves to remove the need in the other person to Stray.\n\nMy issue is that you assert that an older guy is less worthy of respect than the younger guy when it comes to trust. That it is okay to disrespect an old guy, simply because he isn\u2019t 20 something. If you make a promise that is dependent upon how much you respect the other person then that is a reflection of your own honour and your word becomes meaningless. \n\nRegarding age:\n\nPlacing more value on a young guy, because he has potential versus an older guy who is a proven commodity, is not intrinsically the best view.\n\nYouthful desires are valid. As aSD I can\u2019t behoove her for listing after youth. But I would argue that the sugar is better suited to age gap relationships where the young person values maturity, over youthful appearance. To say that sugar is purely about the money is to basically admit that it\u2019s all prostitution and for a large percentage of people (perhaps not the majority) that is not the case.",

I showed the difference between a man sugardating because he has a dead bedroom but doesn't want to destroy his family, and a sugar baby lying about seeing others so she can keep using her sugar daddy as an ATM. And I've seen posts from sugar babies in sugar baby only groups where they boast about having multiple sugar daddies and lying to them so they can get more money, moreover, encouraging others to do it. There's a difference between intentionally using people, and someone just trying to get a little intimacy in their life.\n\nBut it's great to know you're the kind of man who doesn't respect women unless they think the way you want them to.",

Someone who felt the need to get on their soapbox to criticize SBs that violate their monogamous agreement with their SD would have been fine until OP decided to defend the married SDs. Like you said, there are a myriad of reasons why someone cheats (some more sympathetic than others) but somehow she decided to defend all married SDs and cast blame on the wives \u2014that shit was wild to read. \ud83d\ude02 I agree, none of it matters in an agreement between an SB/SD. No one brought it up but OP who decided to write a thesis and naturally people will debate this hypocritical take as it is a thread. That\u2019s where we are right now.",

Some even encourage others to cheat, or to charge for monogamy they don't actually do.  I understand needing to meet needs, but I'm against the idea of dehumanizing and using others to do so.\n\nIf I saw comments from guys pretending to be monogamous with sugar babies so they could fuck as many girls as they could, I would be against that as well. Maybe I should have mentioned that on my main post, and then you wouldn't be attacking me.",

Hell if anything because the consequences of an SD lying to his married wife is higher, then the lie is worse. Why do you expect SBs/SDs to communicate but not two married folks? You realize cheating destroys families, not divorce, right? Cheating is the precursor to divorce. Girl, I hope you keep these reasonings in mind if you ever find your husband cheating. You can just tell him what you told us here today. \n\nAgain, my issue here is not married SDs or cheating. It\u2019s you making a distinction between two wrongs when it\u2019s all equally wrong.

So I am speaking from the understandings that have been given me. I'm sure there are ones who are Not in dead bedrooms and could have great sex with their wife and cheat just because they want to, but unless I've been lied to or had a poor sample, that's not the majority.\n\nThe reason why I take issue with SB's not upholding their monogamous sugardating agreement is because I have seen some talk about their sugar daddies like just ATMs to use and discuss having multiple and lying about monogamy to get as much money as they can. Some even encourage others to cheat.  I understand needing to meet needs, but I'm against the idea of dehumanizing and using others to do so.\n\nIf I saw posts or comments from guys pretending to be monogamous with sugar babies so they can raw dog as many girls as they can, I would be against that as well.

It just has added caveats to it, which are agreed to beforehand by both parties. Even SRs with ages closer together, like mine, have that expiry date. I'm 46 and my SC are only a handful of years older.\n\nAgain, the issue here is less about age gaps & money and mostly about basic respect.

If a person has needs I cannot meet, then I enjoy the short time we have, thank them, and move on. This is the most basic of manners & respect.

Throughout our entire marriage, her libido kept going up. She was *insatiable* in her early and mid 40-s. Much more so than in her 20-s and 30-s. This is very common.\n\nEarly 20-something girls are perfectly capable of going without sex for months. Not every 20-something girl has a BF or is hooking up constantly. And they do it without being paid. \n\nIf they are capable of doing THAT, surely it can't be that difficult to stick to an exclusivity agreement with their SD. It's just a matter of being respectful and honest.",

Whether it be marriage or arrangement, I think forcing those sorts of promises from people is inherently flawed. If people want exclusivity, then they need to do the work themselves to remove the need in the other person to Stray.\n\nMy issue is that you assert that an older guy is less worthy of respect than the younger guy when it comes to trust. That it is okay to disrespect an old guy, simply because he isn\u2019t 20 something. If you make a promise that is dependent upon how much you respect the other person then that is a reflection of your own honour and your word becomes meaningless. \n\nRegarding age:\n\nPlacing more value on a young guy, because he has potential versus an older guy who is a proven commodity, is not intrinsically the best view.\n\nYouthful desires are valid. As aSD I can\u2019t behoove her for listing after youth. But I would argue that the sugar is better suited to age gap relationships where the young person values maturity, over youthful appearance. To say that sugar is purely about the money is to basically admit that it\u2019s all prostitution and for a large percentage of people (perhaps not the majority) that is not the case.",

There's no consequence, other than perhaps the lapse of time between breaking off and getting a new one.\n\nI expect sugar daddies to do the exact same thing in regards to their sugar babies. They should communicate if their needs aren't being met, and break things off and find another sugar baby if nothing changes. No biggie.\n\nWhy don't I expect married SD's to do the same?\n\n-married men are (usually) in longer relationships than sugar relationships\n\n-breaking off the marriage can destroy the family\n\n-sometimes the wife is financially dependent on the man, and ending things would fuck her over\n\n-there's the whole \"divorce will hurt the kids\" \n\n-there's the stress of getting new living arrangements, and possibly the stress of having to get a lawyer and figure out what belongs to who\n\n-there's the fact that usually married men love their wives and intend to be with them forever, whereas sugardating is intended and understood to be temporary\n\n\nSo no, it's Not the same thing. A sugar baby or sugar daddy could easily just end the sugar relationship and get another sugar partner. \n\nSugar babies are Usually not married, and if they Were married and were sugardating to bring in money to save the house or to get intimacy and meet needs their partner couldn't? \nI would be understanding of it, just like I am with the married men.\n\nI'm not the one being inconsistent.

Some even encourage others to cheat, or to charge for monogamy they don't actually do.  I understand needing to meet needs, but I'm against the idea of dehumanizing and using others to do so.\n\nIf I saw comments from guys pretending to be monogamous with sugar babies so they could fuck as many girls as they could, I would be against that as well. Maybe I should have mentioned that on my main post, and then you wouldn't be attacking me.",

Hell if anything because the consequences of an SD lying to his married wife is higher, then the lie is worse. Why do you expect SBs/SDs to communicate but not two married folks? You realize cheating destroys families, not divorce, right? Cheating is the precursor to divorce. Girl, I hope you keep these reasonings in mind if you ever find your husband cheating. You can just tell him what you told us here today. \n\nAgain, my issue here is not married SDs or cheating. It\u2019s you making a distinction between two wrongs when it\u2019s all equally wrong.

So I am speaking from the understandings that have been given me. I'm sure there are ones who are Not in dead bedrooms and could have great sex with their wife and cheat just because they want to, but unless I've been lied to or had a poor sample, that's not the majority.\n\nThe reason why I take issue with SB's not upholding their monogamous sugardating agreement is because I have seen some talk about their sugar daddies like just ATMs to use and discuss having multiple and lying about monogamy to get as much money as they can. Some even encourage others to cheat.  I understand needing to meet needs, but I'm against the idea of dehumanizing and using others to do so.\n\nIf I saw posts or comments from guys pretending to be monogamous with sugar babies so they can raw dog as many girls as they can, I would be against that as well.

Whether it be marriage or arrangement, I think forcing those sorts of promises from people is inherently flawed. If people want exclusivity, then they need to do the work themselves to remove the need in the other person to Stray.\n\nMy issue is that you assert that an older guy is less worthy of respect than the younger guy when it comes to trust. That it is okay to disrespect an old guy, simply because he isn\u2019t 20 something. If you make a promise that is dependent upon how much you respect the other person then that is a reflection of your own honour and your word becomes meaningless. \n\nRegarding age:\n\nPlacing more value on a young guy, because he has potential versus an older guy who is a proven commodity, is not intrinsically the best view.\n\nYouthful desires are valid. As aSD I can\u2019t behoove her for listing after youth. But I would argue that the sugar is better suited to age gap relationships where the young person values maturity, over youthful appearance. To say that sugar is purely about the money is to basically admit that it\u2019s all prostitution and for a large percentage of people (perhaps not the majority) that is not the case.",

There's no consequence, other than perhaps the lapse of time between breaking off and getting a new one.\n\nI expect sugar daddies to do the exact same thing in regards to their sugar babies. They should communicate if their needs aren't being met, and break things off and find another sugar baby if nothing changes. No biggie.\n\nWhy don't I expect married SD's to do the same?\n\n-married men are (usually) in longer relationships than sugar relationships\n\n-breaking off the marriage can destroy the family\n\n-sometimes the wife is financially dependent on the man, and ending things would fuck her over\n\n-there's the whole \"divorce will hurt the kids\" \n\n-there's the stress of getting new living arrangements, and possibly the stress of having to get a lawyer and figure out what belongs to who\n\n-there's the fact that usually married men love their wives and intend to be with them forever, whereas sugardating is intended and understood to be temporary\n\n\nSo no, it's Not the same thing. A sugar baby or sugar daddy could easily just end the sugar relationship and get another sugar partner. \n\nSugar babies are Usually not married, and if they Were married and were sugardating to bring in money to save the house or to get intimacy and meet needs their partner couldn't? \nI would be understanding of it, just like I am with the married men.\n\nI'm not the one being inconsistent. You're just trying to measure two things that aren't the same and don't have nearly the same consequences.",

I understand needing to meet needs, but I'm against the idea of dehumanizing and using others to do so.\n\nIf I saw comments from guys pretending to be monogamous with sugar babies so they could fuck as many girls as they could, I would be against that as well. Maybe I should have mentioned that on my main post, and then you wouldn't be attacking me.",

I've seen people walk away from *millions* because they had a dream and wanted a *chance* at a family (that they didn't have yet.)  Its okay and rational for people to want that.\n\nTrump can pay Melania for exclusivity. Fine. But a girl for a few thousand a month? Come on. If I offered to sell you Gucci for a few dollars... who is the fool in that transaction? \n\nPlease hold rich dudes to a higher standard. If they are as naive as you assert, they dont deserve to be rich. \n\nI am sorry I was mean to you, a fellow who appears to despise Republicans and I'm guess is west coast. That's not the kind of person I intend to hurt, and in any case, I dont usually persuade anyone. (I've long given up on that.)",

So I am speaking from the understandings that have been given me. I'm sure there are ones who are Not in dead bedrooms and could have great sex with their wife and cheat just because they want to, but unless I've been lied to or had a poor sample, that's not the majority.\n\nThe reason why I take issue with SB's not upholding their monogamous sugardating agreement is because I have seen some talk about their sugar daddies like just ATMs to use and discuss having multiple and lying about monogamy to get as much money as they can. Some even encourage others to cheat.  I understand needing to meet needs, but I'm against the idea of dehumanizing and using others to do so.\n\nIf I saw posts or comments from guys pretending to be monogamous with sugar babies so they can raw dog as many girls as they can, I would be against that as well.

No kids, no marriage, no assets. \n\nThere are plenty of SDs out there who have 30 years on me, and I would be giving them the exact same consideration and respect that I do the people I'm with. This was just as true when I was 20. I don't sleep with people I'm not genuinely attracted to, let alone form relationships with them or take their money. I am not unique in this. If a person has needs I cannot meet, then I enjoy the short time we have, thank them, and move on. This is the most basic of manners & respect. I also won't enter into a relationship with people who can't offer me what I'm looking for for the same reasons.",

Throughout our entire marriage, her libido kept going up. She was *insatiable* in her early and mid 40-s. Much more so than in her 20-s and 30-s. This is very common.\n\nEarly 20-something girls are perfectly capable of going without sex for months. Not every 20-something girl has a BF or is hooking up constantly. And they do it without being paid. \n\nIf they are capable of doing THAT, surely it can't be that difficult to stick to an exclusivity agreement with their SD. It's just a matter of being respectful and honest.",

Whether it be marriage or arrangement, I think forcing those sorts of promises from people is inherently flawed. If people want exclusivity, then they need to do the work themselves to remove the need in the other person to Stray.\n\nMy issue is that you assert that an older guy is less worthy of respect than the younger guy when it comes to trust. That it is okay to disrespect an old guy, simply because he isn\u2019t 20 something. If you make a promise that is dependent upon how much you respect the other person then that is a reflection of your own honour and your word becomes meaningless. \n\nRegarding age:\n\nPlacing more value on a young guy, because he has potential versus an older guy who is a proven commodity, is not intrinsically the best view.\n\nYouthful desires are valid. As aSD I can\u2019t behoove her for listing after youth. But I would argue that the sugar is better suited to age gap relationships where the young person values maturity, over youthful appearance. To say that sugar is purely about the money is to basically admit that it\u2019s all prostitution and for a large percentage of people (perhaps not the majority) that is not the case.",

You can just tell him what you told us here today. \n\nAgain, my issue here is not married SDs or cheating. It\u2019s you making a distinction between two wrongs when it\u2019s all equally wrong.

So I am speaking from the understandings that have been given me. I'm sure there are ones who are Not in dead bedrooms and could have great sex with their wife and cheat just because they want to, but unless I've been lied to or had a poor sample, that's not the majority.\n\nThe reason why I take issue with SB's not upholding their monogamous sugardating agreement is because I have seen some talk about their sugar daddies like just ATMs to use and discuss having multiple and lying about monogamy to get as much money as they can. Some even encourage others to cheat.  I understand needing to meet needs, but I'm against the idea of dehumanizing and using others to do so.\n\nIf I saw posts or comments from guys pretending to be monogamous with sugar babies so they can raw dog as many girls as they can, I would be against that as well.

Throughout our entire marriage, her libido kept going up. She was *insatiable* in her early and mid 40-s. Much more so than in her 20-s and 30-s. This is very common.\n\nEarly 20-something girls are perfectly capable of going without sex for months. Not every 20-something girl has a BF or is hooking up constantly. And they do it without being paid. \n\nIf they are capable of doing THAT, surely it can't be that difficult to stick to an exclusivity agreement with their SD.

Whether it be marriage or arrangement, I think forcing those sorts of promises from people is inherently flawed. If people want exclusivity, then they need to do the work themselves to remove the need in the other person to Stray.\n\nMy issue is that you assert that an older guy is less worthy of respect than the younger guy when it comes to trust. That it is okay to disrespect an old guy, simply because he isn\u2019t 20 something. If you make a promise that is dependent upon how much you respect the other person then that is a reflection of your own honour and your word becomes meaningless. \n\nRegarding age:\n\nPlacing more value on a young guy, because he has potential versus an older guy who is a proven commodity, is not intrinsically the best view.\n\nYouthful desires are valid. As aSD I can\u2019t behoove her for listing after youth. But I would argue that the sugar is better suited to age gap relationships where the young person values maturity, over youthful appearance. To say that sugar is purely about the money is to basically admit that it\u2019s all prostitution and for a large percentage of people (perhaps not the majority) that is not the case.",

Some even encourage others to cheat, or to charge for monogamy they don't actually do.  I understand needing to meet needs, but I'm against the idea of dehumanizing and using others to do so.\n\nIf I saw comments from guys pretending to be monogamous with sugar babies so they could fuck as many girls as they could, I would be against that as well. Maybe I should have mentioned that on my main post, and then you wouldn't be attacking me.",

You can just tell him what you told us here today. \n\nAgain, my issue here is not married SDs or cheating. It\u2019s you making a distinction between two wrongs when it\u2019s all equally wrong.

So I am speaking from the understandings that have been given me. I'm sure there are ones who are Not in dead bedrooms and could have great sex with their wife and cheat just because they want to, but unless I've been lied to or had a poor sample, that's not the majority.\n\nThe reason why I take issue with SB's not upholding their monogamous sugardating agreement is because I have seen some talk about their sugar daddies like just ATMs to use and discuss having multiple and lying about monogamy to get as much money as they can. Some even encourage others to cheat.  I understand needing to meet needs, but I'm against the idea of dehumanizing and using others to do so.\n\nIf I saw posts or comments from guys pretending to be monogamous with sugar babies so they can raw dog as many girls as they can, I would be against that as well. Perhaps I should have mentioned that on my main post, maybe then people wouldn't be attacking me so much",

And I've seen posts from sugar babies in sugar baby only groups where they boast about having multiple sugar daddies and lying to them so they can get more money, moreover, encouraging others to do it.

I understand needing to meet needs, but I'm against the idea of dehumanizing and using others to do so.\n\nIf I saw comments from guys pretending to be monogamous with sugar babies so they could fuck as many girls as they could, I would be against that as well.

If they are as naive as you assert, they dont deserve to be rich. \n\nI am sorry I was mean to you, a fellow who appears to despise Republicans and I'm guess is west coast.

So I am speaking from the understandings that have been given me. I'm sure there are ones who are Not in dead bedrooms and could have great sex with their wife and cheat just because they want to, but unless I've been lied to or had a poor sample, that's not the majority.\n\nThe reason why I take issue with SB's not upholding their monogamous sugardating agreement is because I have seen some talk about their sugar daddies like just ATMs to use and discuss having multiple and lying about monogamy to get as much money as they can. Some even encourage others to cheat.  I understand needing to meet needs, but I'm against the idea of dehumanizing and using others to do so.\n\nIf I saw posts or comments from guys pretending to be monogamous with sugar babies so they can raw dog as many girls as they can, I would be against that as well.

If a person has needs I cannot meet, then I enjoy the short time we have, thank them, and move on. This is the most basic of manners & respect.

And I've seen posts from sugar babies in sugar baby only groups where they boast about having multiple sugar daddies and lying to them so they can get more money, moreover, encouraging others to do it. There's a difference between intentionally using people, and someone just trying to get a little intimacy in their life.\n\nBut it's great to know you're the kind of man who doesn't respect women unless they think the way you want them to.",

There's no consequence, other than perhaps the lapse of time between breaking off and getting a new one.\n\nI expect sugar daddies to do the exact same thing in regards to their sugar babies. They should communicate if their needs aren't being met, and break things off and find another sugar baby if nothing changes. No biggie.\n\nWhy don't I expect married SD's to do the same?\n\n-married men are (usually) in longer relationships than sugar relationships\n\n-breaking off the marriage can destroy the family\n\n-sometimes the wife is financially dependent on the man, and ending things would fuck her over\n\n-there's the whole \"divorce will hurt the kids\" \n\n-there's the stress of getting new living arrangements, and possibly the stress of having to get a lawyer and figure out what belongs to who\n\n-there's the fact that usually married men love their wives and intend to be with them forever, whereas sugardating is intended and understood to be temporary\n\n\nSo no, it's Not the same thing. A sugar baby or sugar daddy could easily just end the sugar relationship and get another sugar partner. \n\nSugar babies are Usually not married, and if they Were married and were sugardating to bring in money to save the house or to get intimacy and meet needs their partner couldn't? \nI would be understanding of it, just like I am with the married men.\n\nI'm not the one being inconsistent.

So I am speaking from the understandings that have been given me. I'm sure there are ones who are Not in dead bedrooms and could have great sex with their wife and cheat just because they want to, but unless I've been lied to or had a poor sample, that's not the majority.\n\nThe reason why I take issue with SB's not upholding their monogamous sugardating agreement is because I have seen some talk about their sugar daddies like just ATMs to use and discuss having multiple and lying about monogamy to get as much money as they can. Some even encourage others to cheat.  I understand needing to meet needs, but I'm against the idea of dehumanizing and using others to do so.\n\nIf I saw posts or comments from guys pretending to be monogamous with sugar babies so they can raw dog as many girls as they can, I would be against that as well. Perhaps I should have mentioned that on my main post, maybe then people wouldn't be attacking me so much",

There's no consequence, other than perhaps the lapse of time between breaking off and getting a new one.\n\nI expect sugar daddies to do the exact same thing in regards to their sugar babies. They should communicate if their needs aren't being met, and break things off and find another sugar baby if nothing changes. No biggie.\n\nWhy don't I expect married SD's to do the same?\n\n-married men are (usually) in longer relationships than sugar relationships\n\n-breaking off the marriage can destroy the family\n\n-sometimes the wife is financially dependent on the man, and ending things would fuck her over\n\n-there's the whole \"divorce will hurt the kids\" \n\n-there's the stress of getting new living arrangements, and possibly the stress of having to get a lawyer and figure out what belongs to who\n\n-there's the fact that usually married men love their wives and intend to be with them forever, whereas sugardating is intended and understood to be temporary\n\n\nSo no, it's Not the same thing. A sugar baby or sugar daddy could easily just end the sugar relationship and get another sugar partner. \n\nSugar babies are Usually not married, and if they Were married and were sugardating to bring in money to save the house or to get intimacy and meet needs their partner couldn't? \nI would be understanding of it, just like I am with the married men.\n\nI'm not the one being inconsistent.

I understand needing to meet needs, but I'm against the idea of dehumanizing and using others to do so.\n\nIf I saw comments from guys pretending to be monogamous with sugar babies so they could fuck as many girls as they could, I would be against that as well.

So I am speaking from the understandings that have been given me. I'm sure there are ones who are Not in dead bedrooms and could have great sex with their wife and cheat just because they want to, but unless I've been lied to or had a poor sample, that's not the majority.\n\nThe reason why I take issue with SB's not upholding their monogamous sugardating agreement is because I have seen some talk about their sugar daddies like just ATMs to use and discuss having multiple and lying about monogamy to get as much money as they can. Some even encourage others to cheat.  I understand needing to meet needs, but I'm against the idea of dehumanizing and using others to do so.\n\nIf I saw posts or comments from guys pretending to be monogamous with sugar babies so they can raw dog as many girls as they can, I would be against that as well.

So I am speaking from the understandings that have been given me. I'm sure there are ones who are Not in dead bedrooms and could have great sex with their wife and cheat just because they want to, but unless I've been lied to or had a poor sample, that's not the majority.\n\nThe reason why I take issue with SB's not upholding their monogamous sugardating agreement is because I have seen some talk about their sugar daddies like just ATMs to use and discuss having multiple and lying about monogamy to get as much money as they can. Some even encourage others to cheat.  I understand needing to meet needs, but I'm against the idea of dehumanizing and using others to do so.\n\nIf I saw posts or comments from guys pretending to be monogamous with sugar babies so they can raw dog as many girls as they can, I would be against that as well.

So I am speaking from the understandings that have been given me. I'm sure there are ones who are Not in dead bedrooms and could have great sex with their wife and cheat just because they want to, but unless I've been lied to or had a poor sample, that's not the majority.\n\nThe reason why I take issue with SB's not upholding their monogamous sugardating agreement is because I have seen some talk about their sugar daddies like just ATMs to use and discuss having multiple and lying about monogamy to get as much money as they can. Some even encourage others to cheat.  I understand needing to meet needs, but I'm against the idea of dehumanizing and using others to do so.\n\nIf I saw posts or comments from guys pretending to be monogamous with sugar babies so they can raw dog as many girls as they can, I would be against that as well.

Like you said, there are a myriad of reasons why someone cheats (some more sympathetic than others) but somehow she decided to defend all married SDs and cast blame on the wives \u2014that shit was wild to read. \ud83d\ude02 I agree, none of it matters in an agreement between an SB/SD. No one brought it up but OP who decided to write a thesis and naturally people will debate this hypocritical take as it is a thread. That\u2019s where we are right now.",

There's no consequence, other than perhaps the lapse of time between breaking off and getting a new one.\n\nI expect sugar daddies to do the exact same thing in regards to their sugar babies. They should communicate if their needs aren't being met, and break things off and find another sugar baby if nothing changes. No biggie.\n\nWhy don't I expect married SD's to do the same?\n\n-married men are (usually) in longer relationships than sugar relationships\n\n-breaking off the marriage can destroy the family\n\n-sometimes the wife is financially dependent on the man, and ending things would fuck her over\n\n-there's the whole \"divorce will hurt the kids\" \n\n-there's the stress of getting new living arrangements, and possibly the stress of having to get a lawyer and figure out what belongs to who\n\n-there's the fact that usually married men love their wives and intend to be with them forever, whereas sugardating is intended and understood to be temporary\n\n\nSo no, it's Not the same thing. A sugar baby or sugar daddy could easily just end the sugar relationship and get another sugar partner. \n\nSugar babies are Usually not married, and if they Were married and were sugardating to bring in money to save the house or to get intimacy and meet needs their partner couldn't? \nI would be understanding of it, just like I am with the married men.\n\nI'm not the one being inconsistent.

You can just tell him what you told us here today. \n\nAgain, my issue here is not married SDs or cheating. It\u2019s you making a distinction between two wrongs when it\u2019s all equally wrong.

So I am speaking from the understandings that have been given me. I'm sure there are ones who are Not in dead bedrooms and could have great sex with their wife and cheat just because they want to, but unless I've been lied to or had a poor sample, that's not the majority.\n\nThe reason why I take issue with SB's not upholding their monogamous sugardating agreement is because I have seen some talk about their sugar daddies like just ATMs to use and discuss having multiple and lying about monogamy to get as much money as they can. Some even encourage others to cheat.  I understand needing to meet needs, but I'm against the idea of dehumanizing and using others to do so.\n\nIf I saw posts or comments from guys pretending to be monogamous with sugar babies so they can raw dog as many girls as they can, I would be against that as well.

Someone who felt the need to get on their soapbox to criticize SBs that violate their monogamous agreement with their SD would have been fine until OP decided to defend the married SDs. Like you said, there are a myriad of reasons why someone cheats (some more sympathetic than others) but somehow she decided to defend all married SDs and cast blame on the wives \u2014that shit was wild to read. \ud83d\ude02 I agree, none of it matters in an agreement between an SB/SD.

So I am speaking from the understandings that have been given me. I'm sure there are ones who are Not in dead bedrooms and could have great sex with their wife and cheat just because they want to, but unless I've been lied to or had a poor sample, that's not the majority.\n\nThe reason why I take issue with SB's not upholding their monogamous sugardating agreement is because I have seen some talk about their sugar daddies like just ATMs to use and discuss having multiple and lying about monogamy to get as much money as they can. Some even encourage others to cheat.  I understand needing to meet needs, but I'm against the idea of dehumanizing and using others to do so.\n\nIf I saw posts or comments from guys pretending to be monogamous with sugar babies so they can raw dog as many girls as they can, I would be against that as well.

I understand needing to meet needs, but I'm against the idea of dehumanizing and using others to do so.\n\nIf I saw comments from guys pretending to be monogamous with sugar babies so they could fuck as many girls as they could, I would be against that as well.

So I am speaking from the understandings that have been given me. I'm sure there are ones who are Not in dead bedrooms and could have great sex with their wife and cheat just because they want to, but unless I've been lied to or had a poor sample, that's not the majority.\n\nThe reason why I take issue with SB's not upholding their monogamous sugardating agreement is because I have seen some talk about their sugar daddies like just ATMs to use and discuss having multiple and lying about monogamy to get as much money as they can. Some even encourage others to cheat.  I understand needing to meet needs, but I'm against the idea of dehumanizing and using others to do so.\n\nIf I saw posts or comments from guys pretending to be monogamous with sugar babies so they can raw dog as many girls as they can, I would be against that as well.

Someone who felt the need to get on their soapbox to criticize SBs that violate their monogamous agreement with their SD would have been fine until OP decided to defend the married SDs.

Most SBs  are having issues with you criticizing SBs not upholding their monogamous agreement but then saying it was ok for SDs to cheat on their wives. Like we get married SDs exist, but we\u2019re not going out of our way to defend them or give their actions a pass because the consequences for them is higher. Two things can be wrong. In either scenarios, I can\u2019t make anyone do anything except I can hold myself accountable and be honest.",

So I am speaking from the understandings that have been given me. I'm sure there are ones who are Not in dead bedrooms and could have great sex with their wife and cheat just because they want to, but unless I've been lied to or had a poor sample, that's not the majority.\n\nThe reason why I take issue with SB's not upholding their monogamous sugardating agreement is because I have seen some talk about their sugar daddies like just ATMs to use and discuss having multiple and lying about monogamy to get as much money as they can. Some even encourage others to cheat.  I understand needing to meet needs, but I'm against the idea of dehumanizing and using others to do so.\n\nIf I saw posts or comments from guys pretending to be monogamous with sugar babies so they can raw dog as many girls as they can, I would be against that as well. Perhaps I should have mentioned that on my main post, maybe then people wouldn't be attacking me so much",

So I am speaking from the understandings that have been given me. I'm sure there are ones who are Not in dead bedrooms and could have great sex with their wife and cheat just because they want to, but unless I've been lied to or had a poor sample, that's not the majority.\n\nThe reason why I take issue with SB's not upholding their monogamous sugardating agreement is because I have seen some talk about their sugar daddies like just ATMs to use and discuss having multiple and lying about monogamy to get as much money as they can. Some even encourage others to cheat.  I understand needing to meet needs, but I'm against the idea of dehumanizing and using others to do so.\n\nIf I saw posts or comments from guys pretending to be monogamous with sugar babies so they can raw dog as many girls as they can, I would be against that as well. Perhaps I should have mentioned that on my main post, maybe then people wouldn't be attacking me so much",

Some even encourage others to cheat, or to charge for monogamy they don't actually do.  I understand needing to meet needs, but I'm against the idea of dehumanizing and using others to do so.\n\nIf I saw comments from guys pretending to be monogamous with sugar babies so they could fuck as many girls as they could, I would be against that as well. Maybe I should have mentioned that on my main post, and then you wouldn't be attacking me.",

Some even encourage others to cheat, or to charge for monogamy they don't actually do.  I understand needing to meet needs, but I'm against the idea of dehumanizing and using others to do so.\n\nIf I saw comments from guys pretending to be monogamous with sugar babies so they could fuck as many girls as they could, I would be against that as well. Maybe I should have mentioned that on my main post, and then you wouldn't be attacking me.",

Some even encourage others to cheat, or to charge for monogamy they don't actually do.  I understand needing to meet needs, but I'm against the idea of dehumanizing and using others to do so.\n\nIf I saw comments from guys pretending to be monogamous with sugar babies so they could fuck as many girls as they could, I would be against that as well. Maybe I should have mentioned that on my main post, and then you wouldn't be attacking me.",

I understand needing to meet needs, but I'm against the idea of dehumanizing and using others to do so.\n\nIf I saw comments from guys pretending to be monogamous with sugar babies so they could fuck as many girls as they could, I would be against that as well.
