I imagine it's a common technique for the Pick Up Artists and Red Pill guys.  Many of whom see trying to pick up Sugar Babies for free as a game where they brag about their successes and award each trophies for their success.\n\nIf I like spending time with a woman and I think the woman likes spending time with me, I take care of them because I have the resources and they need the help.  Helping somebody you care about that needs help is what we should all be doing!\n\nWhy should I be ashamed of helping someone I care for?  I would be more ashamed if I was unable to help or even worse if I could help, but selfishly chose not to.",

Both can and have worked in the SA environment for me so it is unfair to say \"why are you on SA\". There are a broad spectrum of people that use the site as a way to connect with people for different reasons and motivations.\n\nOn the flip side if guys are arrogant about it and put that out there after giving their sexual expectations, that is just a guy being a douchebag.
