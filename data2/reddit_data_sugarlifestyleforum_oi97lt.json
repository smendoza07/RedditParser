    "body": "I know there is always a steady stream of posts around finding something or someone who\u2019s real so felt compelled to post today. I just ended my most recent SR merely 2 hours ago. Been together 6 months and was probably some of the funnest, intense, and outright most amazing times I\u2019ve had (and I\u2019ve been an SD in the bowl for awhile). Ours was a relationship that was an 11 on a 10 point scale. From laughing to intimacy to those late night life altering discussions, we were always connected and in sync. I noticed she had been charging a bit the last week or two and we finally got the real issue out in the open. She ultimately wanted her happily ever after which I\u2019m just not in a position to give at this stage of my life. She, more than any person I\u2019ve ever met, deserves this. While we agreed that we ultimately want to remain friends, I have no doubt this will be difficult given the intensity of our SR. To all those that think SA is a scam or that there aren\u2019t real SB\u2019s or SD\u2019s there, stay the course and be patient. They are there and can truly give you experiences and perspectives you may have never thought possible. Onward and upward\u2026",
