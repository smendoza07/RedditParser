Also get your beard trimmed and shaped professionally. Also in both pics it looks like your head is tilted down slightly. This makes it hard to look at the proportions of your head/face (exaggerates the width of your forehead etc.). This makes it harder to give the best advice about length. A pic where your head is not tilted would get you the best feedback. ",
