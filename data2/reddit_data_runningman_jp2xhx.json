We can support him by watching and buying his new\nReleased album. \nMany people got angry with him coz of what he did, but we don\u2019t have any idea of his situation back then, it is hard to judge someone\u2019s decisions if you don\u2019t know the circumstances. We can only respect the decision he made because in life no decision was wrong. Decisions are made to make you a better person. It is the consequences makes us become stronger to live the life we dream along the way.",
