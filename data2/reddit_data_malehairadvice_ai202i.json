The model has long hair on the top and I imagine it has been cut with shorter pieces in the interior to support the long pieces and reduce the overall weight of the hair so that it can be styled like that. I would take this picture to a stylist and explain what you would like. If your hair is too dense you will not be able to easily achieve this with any product. An experienced stylist will be able to understand how to help you achieve this. \n\nAs far as product goes, I would use a volumizing  powder on the roots of dry hair to get the lift and then a dry wax, either spray or paste to manipulate the ends.
