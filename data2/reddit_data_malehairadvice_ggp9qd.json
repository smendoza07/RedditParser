Before washing I put rice water, grapefruit juice, pure orange juice, coconut oil in my hair.\nWhile damp I put Cantu leave in conditioner, Cantu curling cream, Shea moisture curling souffl\u00e9, coconut oil. Let it dry somewhat. Wet my hair slightly, then I get a curling sponge and go over my hair with both sides for 2 minutes. And thanks! My curls now are slightly more defined than the picture.",
