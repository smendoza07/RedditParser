    "body": "I sometimes find profiles or posts saying a transactional SR is terrible and you must have a genuine emotional connection .\n\nI personally disagree with this sentiment. I like having a strictly transactional SR without emotional connection.\n\nI'm not saying SR with emotional connections are bad. They are great in fact. But they are extremely hard to come by and will from time to time put each other in awkward situations.\n\nTransactional relationships are great in their own ways. Each party knows what they want. I want a relaxing date and intimacy, and SB wants financial support. Done deal. No drama, no emotional moments, just simple good time.\n\nWhat's your take on transactional SR?",

I'm reading that delusional is just another word based on opinion, and YOU decide whether it's insulting or not. Personally, I'm not so reactive so I read OP's comment in a neutral tone of voice. Maybe you just assume everyone is attacking you so you read it as name-calling? The odd thing is your definition doesn't say anything about the word \"delusional\" having an implied insult. I just probably wouldn't go so far as to say it's \"hostile\" esp when the rest of the comment didn't have any other elements of hostility... but hey if you want to be offended by a single comment on the internet that is within the context of a neutral comment, then you do you, boo.  \n\n\nNOTE: this comment was also written in a friendly, neutral tone, and it's up to you to decide how you want to read it, which can change a normal comment into something seething with anger, but that anger is applied by you, not the writer.",

If I was satisfied with something transactional, there would be little reason to put up with all the nonsense of SA, meet and greets, etc., when the transactional areas of the sex industry are so much easier and faster to navigate.  Perhaps the only reason would be if I wanted my partner to have fewer ongoing sexual partners.\n\nWhat makes and SR so amazing is the emotional intimacy.  It makes everything better, most especially the sex, but all the other time we spend together also, all the getting-to-know-her, etc.  Once I really dig her, even spoiling her provides me almost as much pleasure as her, it's something I look forward to -- but only because of how I feel about her.  But I don't tend to lose sight of the relationship -- it's an arrangement, and I tend not to fall in love with, or get jealous of, my SBs (as I've said many times, my SB and I are open about our vanilla and sugaring lives and other partners, so I don't even need \"don't ask, don't tell\" as a cover).  As a result, there's little drama, and when there's emotional moments, they're positive ones, not negative.    If that weren't the case, then the safest course to navigate might be to keep things transactional.\n\nStill, like I said, different strokes.  I like it that there are SDs out there who and pulling the transactional SBs out of the bowl, and I also like it that you're leaving the non-transactional ones for me :)",

Attractive unattached wealthy men seeking sugar  babies do not need to go online to find it.   They just go about their  business being attractive wealthy men.  \n>  \n>In my world, \u201csugar baby\u201d is equivalent to arm candy.   They are  something to be shown off in public and actively involved in social  life.\n\ndescribes a transactional relationship too. You can argue until you're blue in the face \"oh no the above isn't transactional, unlike the typical relationship sought by the 'SA crowd' in this forum\", and I'll just respond that they're both transactional, if \"transaction\" is defined in a broader and more reasonable and consistent way than your preferred definition. The transactional nature of the relationship is just a little better disguised for the type you prefer.\n\nAnd, obviously, it's ridiculous to believe that the weight and age of the SD or SB determines whether the relationship is transactional or not. If that's the case,  I could write an algorithm with the following inputs: weight, height, waist size, age of SD (at a given time during the sugar relationship); weight, height, waist size, age of SB (at the same time); and for certain values of those inputs, the algorithm will spit out \"transactional\".",

In other words, cash on the table for an hour of sex with an escort, as an example, is not deemed a legal relationship, and LE targets, but money for two hours of dinner and then another two in a hotel room is legal. Sad, but true. \n\nAlso true some SBs believe that they are doing sex work but not prostitution because of the connection/relationship/dates at the opera/trips or experiences. And some SDs would also share that belief, as I do. Huge difference between seeing an escort and a SB, though exchange of sex and money in both. \n\nMy SB told two close friends about seeing me, and was somewhat fearful that they would judge her negatively. Apparently they have not. But may be the case that others have heard rumors and reacted in a way that shamed and shows sugaring is still stigmatized among lots of 20-somethings.",

I'm reading that delusional is just another word based on opinion, and YOU decide whether it's insulting or not. Personally, I'm not so reactive so I read OP's comment in a neutral tone of voice. Maybe you just assume everyone is attacking you so you read it as name-calling? The odd thing is your definition doesn't say anything about the word \"delusional\" having an implied insult. I just probably wouldn't go so far as to say it's \"hostile\" esp when the rest of the comment didn't have any other elements of hostility... but hey if you want to be offended by a single comment on the internet that is within the context of a neutral comment, then you do you, boo.  \n\n\nNOTE: this comment was also written in a friendly, neutral tone, and it's up to you to decide how you want to read it, which can change a normal comment into something seething with anger, but that anger is applied by you, not the writer.",

You can argue until you're blue in the face \"oh no the above isn't transactional, unlike the typical relationship sought by the 'SA crowd' in this forum\", and I'll just respond that they're both transactional, if \"transaction\" is defined in a broader and more reasonable and consistent way than your preferred definition. The transactional nature of the relationship is just a little better disguised for the type you prefer.\n\nAnd, obviously, it's ridiculous to believe that the weight and age of the SD or SB determines whether the relationship is transactional or not. If that's the case,  I could write an algorithm with the following inputs: weight, height, waist size, age of SD (at a given time during the sugar relationship); weight, height, waist size, age of SB (at the same time); and for certain values of those inputs, the algorithm will spit out \"transactional\".",

If that was the case, any relationship between a man and women would be sex work. The fact of the matter, what separates sex work from non sex work, is that there is an actual relationship whether its sugar or vanilla. All relationships have an arrangement aspect, whether its how many times you will go out each month, how many times you will have sex each week, or how much support you will give to her.",

In other words, cash on the table for an hour of sex with an escort, as an example, is not deemed a legal relationship, and LE targets, but money for two hours of dinner and then another two in a hotel room is legal. Sad, but true. \n\nAlso true some SBs believe that they are doing sex work but not prostitution because of the connection/relationship/dates at the opera/trips or experiences. And some SDs would also share that belief, as I do. Huge difference between seeing an escort and a SB, though exchange of sex and money in both. \n\nMy SB told two close friends about seeing me, and was somewhat fearful that they would judge her negatively. Apparently they have not. But may be the case that others have heard rumors and reacted in a way that shamed and shows sugaring is still stigmatized among lots of 20-somethings.",

I'm reading that delusional is just another word based on opinion, and YOU decide whether it's insulting or not. Personally, I'm not so reactive so I read OP's comment in a neutral tone of voice. Maybe you just assume everyone is attacking you so you read it as name-calling? The odd thing is your definition doesn't say anything about the word \"delusional\" having an implied insult. I just probably wouldn't go so far as to say it's \"hostile\" esp when the rest of the comment didn't have any other elements of hostility... but hey if you want to be offended by a single comment on the internet that is within the context of a neutral comment, then you do you, boo.  \n\n\nNOTE: this comment was also written in a friendly, neutral tone, and it's up to you to decide how you want to read it, which can change a normal comment into something seething with anger, but that anger is applied by you, not the writer.",

You can argue until you're blue in the face \"oh no the above isn't transactional, unlike the typical relationship sought by the 'SA crowd' in this forum\", and I'll just respond that they're both transactional, if \"transaction\" is defined in a broader and more reasonable and consistent way than your preferred definition. The transactional nature of the relationship is just a little better disguised for the type you prefer.\n\nAnd, obviously, it's ridiculous to believe that the weight and age of the SD or SB determines whether the relationship is transactional or not. If that's the case,  I could write an algorithm with the following inputs: weight, height, waist size, age of SD (at a given time during the sugar relationship); weight, height, waist size, age of SB (at the same time); and for certain values of those inputs, the algorithm will spit out \"transactional\".",

In other words, cash on the table for an hour of sex with an escort, as an example, is not deemed a legal relationship, and LE targets, but money for two hours of dinner and then another two in a hotel room is legal. Sad, but true. \n\nAlso true some SBs believe that they are doing sex work but not prostitution because of the connection/relationship/dates at the opera/trips or experiences. And some SDs would also share that belief, as I do. Huge difference between seeing an escort and a SB, though exchange of sex and money in both. \n\nMy SB told two close friends about seeing me, and was somewhat fearful that they would judge her negatively. Apparently they have not. But may be the case that others have heard rumors and reacted in a way that shamed and shows sugaring is still stigmatized among lots of 20-somethings.",

In fact I said the opposite. That the SB should set her boundaries and I should set mine.\n\n>you are no better than anyone else because you have money\n\nPlease point out where I said that I was. We're all doing the same thing here.\n\n>People like you explain a LOT why some men need to pay to have someone next to them.\n\nUhhh...what is the obsession with SDs who *need to pay someone to be with them*. If you're an SB isn't that more of an insult to you than me? I may or may not have to pay, but it sounds like you're dissing the women who line up to be paid to fuck disgusting people like myself on a regular basis. Shame!\n\n>Entitled, arrogant and self-centered.\n\nI'm supposed to pay you to live by your rules. No thanks!",

Maybe you just assume everyone is attacking you so you read it as name-calling? The odd thing is your definition doesn't say anything about the word \"delusional\" having an implied insult. I just probably wouldn't go so far as to say it's \"hostile\" esp when the rest of the comment didn't have any other elements of hostility... but hey if you want to be offended by a single comment on the internet that is within the context of a neutral comment, then you do you, boo.  \n\n\nNOTE: this comment was also written in a friendly, neutral tone, and it's up to you to decide how you want to read it, which can change a normal comment into something seething with anger, but that anger is applied by you, not the writer.",

In other words, cash on the table for an hour of sex with an escort, as an example, is not deemed a legal relationship, and LE targets, but money for two hours of dinner and then another two in a hotel room is legal. Sad, but true. \n\nAlso true some SBs believe that they are doing sex work but not prostitution because of the connection/relationship/dates at the opera/trips or experiences. And some SDs would also share that belief, as I do. Huge difference between seeing an escort and a SB, though exchange of sex and money in both. \n\nMy SB told two close friends about seeing me, and was somewhat fearful that they would judge her negatively. Apparently they have not. But may be the case that others have heard rumors and reacted in a way that shamed and shows sugaring is still stigmatized among lots of 20-somethings.",

Maybe you just assume everyone is attacking you so you read it as name-calling? The odd thing is your definition doesn't say anything about the word \"delusional\" having an implied insult. I just probably wouldn't go so far as to say it's \"hostile\" esp when the rest of the comment didn't have any other elements of hostility... but hey if you want to be offended by a single comment on the internet that is within the context of a neutral comment, then you do you, boo.  \n\n\nNOTE: this comment was also written in a friendly, neutral tone, and it's up to you to decide how you want to read it, which can change a normal comment into something seething with anger, but that anger is applied by you, not the writer.",

In other words, cash on the table for an hour of sex with an escort, as an example, is not deemed a legal relationship, and LE targets, but money for two hours of dinner and then another two in a hotel room is legal. Sad, but true. \n\nAlso true some SBs believe that they are doing sex work but not prostitution because of the connection/relationship/dates at the opera/trips or experiences. And some SDs would also share that belief, as I do. Huge difference between seeing an escort and a SB, though exchange of sex and money in both. \n\nMy SB told two close friends about seeing me, and was somewhat fearful that they would judge her negatively. Apparently they have not. But may be the case that others have heard rumors and reacted in a way that shamed and shows sugaring is still stigmatized among lots of 20-somethings.",
