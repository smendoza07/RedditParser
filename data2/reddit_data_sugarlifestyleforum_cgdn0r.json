    "body": "Okay so I posted about a potential SD that I have been talking to for a couple weeks that wanted me to fly to his city for the first meet and greet. As you guys pointed out the dangers of doing that, I politely declined his request and told him it won\u2019t work between us because of the distance. As an exchange student when I signed up for the site I used an alias name as i don\u2019t want to take any risk of anyone reporting any kind of bullshit about me to immigration ( that\u2019s always a possibility cause people can be mean and jerks). Anyway, after rejecting him today he threatened me that he works for the government he has all my passport info from my name and pics and will report me to immigration unless I agree to his terms. I reported him and blocked him. I am so thankful that I DID NOT go to meet him! This guy is a serious black mailer, tbh I fear he would have raped me when I would have said no to intimacy after the first M&G. Thankyou everyone in this sub who gave me good advise and literally saved my life. Some people questioned why I chose to not reveal my real name , here you go guys , this is why!! Tonight I can still sleep in peace even after getting that nasty threat is because I am under a total fake name on the site, no way he can track me down lol",

One day, I was on LinkedIn and I was looking at who viewed my profile.   And there she was - real name and all.  She did not know that LinkedIn did that, but she inadvertently outed herself.  To this day, I don\u2019t know how she figured out who I was.  \n\nI asked her about it, while assuring her she had nothing to fear from me.  She assured me that my info was safe with her as well, had a laugh about it and moved on.   However, I could have been dangerous, so watch it with social media when you are \u201ccreeping\u201d as she puts it.",
