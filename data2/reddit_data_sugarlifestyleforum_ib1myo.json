    "body": "Does anyone else find it actually insane how so many men were fighting for the right to be as mean and harsh as they want under the veil of giving advice or worse a \u201creality check\u201d to SBs profile reviews.\n\nYet these were the same men that complained to the moon and back that led to allowance or ppm discussions being blocked because not everyone is looking for the same amount of income. And a splenda daddy to some might be a whale to others. \n\nLet\u2019s keep that same energy with SBs thank you, you might not find her attractive but that is not your place to phrase your criticism as if it was representative of all the men on Seeking. Maybe if she came back a week or two later with a post saying why am I am not having luck would it make sense to \u201ctell it as it is\u201d but she is asking for a PROFILE REVIEW not a tell me if you and your bros find me attractive.\n\nOn this note I\u2019d like to suggest bringing ppm and allowance talk, I think what\u2019s fueling a lot of these people is them not having felt judged or criticism for what they have to offer in a long time. Maybe it\u2019ll be good for them, a little humbling experience \u2764\ufe0f\n\nEDIT: Deleted the link of a tactful response because not sure if the woman that comment was for would want her post attached to this!",

SDs accuse SBs of looking only for money and imply they are actually escorts or gold diggers if their expecations are \"out of line\" and both sides accuse the other of lying about how high their allowance is, or how little they are paying.",

If you don't provide other perks like being somewhat handsome, that would make sex more enjoyable (and other, this one came to my mind first) then sorry . as much as some new spiring platonic SBs are delusional about SR without intimacy there a lot of SDs that simply cannot afford being SD.\nEven 300 wouldn't be ok for me unless I got a really nice perks from relationship like for example SD not having a wife, one that can host, SD being handsome. I around one who offered me allowance close to it. He's young and handsome and that makes him he can lower allowance and he is abosolutely right. \nI would gladly see an escort who is similar in look( because that's what SD care for) and ask her how much she charge. That is a good indicator for general ppm although I don't have an opinion about ppm/allowance.\nThere was a one comment on other group by SD \"she asked for 250 and I told her this is too low\" even SD knows that 250 is a very low price for intimacy date.\nSB have more to offer than an escort and it should be rewarded accordingly. \nThere is literally no saying in how much is enough but we all can say that 200 or below is just a rip off. \nI agree it ha dto be adjust to what you have in offer and what POT can offer beside $$.\nA lot of SDs complain that  allowing discussion about allowance will sky-rocket demands from POT SBs but nobody talks about how inexperienced SB is being low balled because she literally has no idea what other asks for and I don't think she will meet a generous men who will not try to take advantage of her.\nThe big question is how much you need but even if you need a little money extra, your body and time is valuable since probably you will not have intimacy with a handsome guy you would be dreaming of. That's I think escorts are a good indicator because they mostly offer intimacy and this intimacy has a price tag. I personally think sugaring should be more expesive than having an escort because SB provide more.\nOn the other hand if you find a guy who you would be vanilla date in real life I don't think most girls would stick to him without sugar involved. There is a reason why those guys are not on the platform or just look for escorts. And if they look for escort then there is a clear price. \nOf course I do not have this midnest of this much for this and this for this because it depends on my connection with the guy. \nI also personally think than sugaring in next level of escorting that's why I am so vocal about it.\n\nSo in conclusion I ask POT a lot of questions to determine what he can offer me. if there is little besides allowance/ppm, then I would demand more for each thing he doesn't provide.\nAnd the area of course. Bigger city bigger sugar.\nI am open for discussion about it but I have to start working in 10 min \ud83d\ude2d",

Its definitely rubbed me the wrong way for a while now but I felt like I couldn't articulate it well enough. I really feel this is one of the main reasons why so many of them on here are so confident and brave about the things they say. \n\nYep I actually don't care about the sex talk it just seems so funny how platonics are shamed so hard because thats not what most of them want. But if someone offers a low allowance we can't have exact discussions  or check in with other women (and even SDs) for reassurance because it may hurt some SDs feelings? Even though most SBs wouldn't want a low allowance, weird lol\n\nYes the comments were so unsettling and the fact that so many people had to baby them through how to speak to others is disturbing too.",

It\u2019s not just about the looks.

Plenty of men if they find you charming enough will literally pay for platonic dates and getting to know you better. Because they are a few rinsers out there all SBs must have sex on the second date...?\n\n Someone even tried to normalize \u201coh dear SBs you will be having sex with a lot of people before you find the right SD.\u201d Does that not sound like something to benefit them like the hypocrisy is insane.

It's important to not get burned out and to take breaks from looking. Sometimes you just have to be in the right place right time, just like in vanilla dating, you dont usually find mr right right away, it takes awhile to find someone you like and are compatible with\"",

I would read constant posts about how to turn off emotions and be robotic in physical activities, how to zone out and get it over with. Extremely large emphasis on \"not getting emotionally attached\". This to me, by definition , is sex work. WORK. It's a job. Punch in, punch out. The whole mentality turned me off and I dont go in those subs anymore. Now do connections happen that's more than physical, do you turn down clients you dont like? Of course we are all human. Nobody is a perfect emotionless sex robot.  There is clear distinction to me between sugaring and sex work. Sugaring involves emotions, kissing, and seeing 1 or 2 sds at a time. Sugaring is real relationships and real emotions. Are there shades of gray? Yes. Is someone clearly an sb or an escort / pro? Not always clear but I can pretty much tell right away now in the first few minutes of conversation. Nothing against escorts more power to ya but stay off of SR sites so we dont get our shit shut down.",

Still, I truly believe that it's a disservice that the only remaining feedback is an echo chamber of positivity. \n\nJust last night, there was a post where an SB announced that after failing to secure an SD and countless scams since *2016*, she was calling it quits.

            "body": "No worries at all u/Sweet_Union_8551. This discussion is strangely inspiring me to play a better game in the bowl. \n\nThe moderator\u2019s change in the profile guidelines shows the level of commodification the SDs of SLF apply to the wide subset of SBs here. They learn our feminine language and repeat them to us for a long time that it\u2019s so easy to mistake our mental voice as someone\u2019s persona when reading their online comments!...I digress. Yet, all this time the reasoning of these \u201cSDs\u201d berating the change in rules for profile review,  shows they see this forum like some business venture and respond as if they were on some rigged reality show like The Shark Tank.\n\n\u201cWe must tell them their chances at success\u201d many of these SDs says while in secret they are getting tired of searching. Somehow open gatekeeping SLF (isn\u2019t that the jobs of Mods?) with their brute force in comments becomes the result. The reality of what makes a SB provide the fantasy that the SD of SLF herald  is that an SB still need to be able to apply social graces to our behavior within the bowl. This is the key to making SR attractive to a woman. She gotta feel that classiness from you everywhere. If we were to do a reality check at our M&G then SDs would disappear (they want someone who will pardon their aged disposition and overlooked their aged behaviors in exchange for feeling beloved). Crude comments out of context is a trigger that yanks a female\u2019s mind out of the fantasy. \n\nAre you really a jerk SD? \u2014 I don\u2019t wanna know. I\u2019ll be your fantasy when you act like a cultured man. Women are triggered by a man\u2019s behavior not the reverse. It seems weak when men openly display being triggered by what they don\u2019t like. Just overlook a strangers looks and maintain composure that you your age supposedly hints at. The SBs you wanna date are doing that when they date someone like you. Don\u2019t kid yourself - if you dress up your behavior rather than nip and tuck it, you\u2019ll get away with murder. But if you demand someone gets plastic surgery while looking like a toad then you won\u2019t be kissed on the SLF platform (I wonder what your reality check on that is like). \n\nWho can calm down the Hulk nature of these SDs? Can we get a Black Widow up in here, since we are unable to identify the Betty-Ross-SBs to calm this shit down! \n\nYou gotta play gently in a woman\u2019s fantasy world  because face it, these SDs wouldn\u2019t find it appealing if women were just as crude and tactless about these older men\u2019s true social success. Both men and women\u2019s attitude created this fantasy world and you distort the balance in the bowl by dragging back the yucky behavior of the real world. Because y\u2019all behaving like the thing we don\u2019t want and get upset when we drop the wide-eye smile you oh so love in our profile review \ud83d\ude03 then SBs will give you the resting face bitch look \ud83d\ude11 when you forget how to behave within the contexts of this platform.\n\nSLF is like a dollhouse with many compartments, not a barn yard for rowdy male playing. Don\u2019t you have money that can buy you the freedom to butt heads elsewhere? \n\nReddit comments have never been some source of protection, just a source of entertainment that\u2019s loosely built on info in the world. You can create and moderate your own forum based on the reality check you want to freely extol on unsuspecting users.",

I thought that was \"just the way it is\", until I once joined an invitation-only sexwork forum that was co-ed with a respect-for-everyone ethos.  It was led by an escort (I think female leadership helped) who ruthlessly refused to take sides and demanded we respect each other.  There were some pretty eye-opening learnings on both side.  But I'm now convinced it's the only way to have a remotely un-toxic discussion forum; viz. the escort-led \"sugar\" subs to see what happens when discussion is one-sided.\n\nAs with that co-ed SW forum, I felt slf did a fantastic job of keeping mutual respect, and the fact is I learned a lot from SBs and SDs on this sub, in a way I would not have learned in an SD-only sub -- and I guarantee you new SBs are not well served by getting their advice from those trying to converge SB norms into escort norms.  We still have our moments -- I think some of yesterday's profile reviewers went out of their way to not just give honest feedback but hurt her feelings, but that's as much a failure of me as a mod to quickly bring us back to respectful-but-honest feedback.  We'll adjust, have our quarrels, but it won't turn permanently toxic and war-of-the-sexes.",

Just like how most guys on sugar dating sites make absolutely nowhere near sugar daddy income and get offended when you expect sugar baby things.\n\nI\u2019m glad you bring this up so I can finally voice my un-easiness with profile ratings in general though. It\u2019s a public Reddit sub and I personally feel uncomfortable posting my photos here, just assuming that everyone in the group must be a SD/SB. There are real freaks out there and voyeurs and I think there are better ways to communicate standards for profiles outside of literally seeing photos.\n\nAnyway ladies remember you are the prize and act accordingly. One of the biggest pitfalls of newer babies is caring way too much what these guys are thinking. Outside of basic decency and presenting yourself as someone who expects nice things by ALREADY having nice things when you meet them, it does not matter what these guys think. Men talk a lot of shit and most of their \u201cstandards\u201d are artificial as fuck as they often have very few. Especially if unattractive, old, lonely, insecure, or all of those. The less you care about that the less it matters. :)",

If we're talking about the same profile review, that was direct commentary about the style of her photos.\n\nI think most SDs have at least dabbled in the escort world. It doesn't take very long to learn the lingo and catch on to various \"styles\" of escort ads. If someone is trying to attract SDs (as opposed to Johns), I would think it's helpful to know that her pics are red flags.",

And I get it, their profile isn't working because SD's don't find them attractive, and they have to pique someone's interest in a different way. \n\nIf someone says that they need to drop 40 lbs, isn't that constructive?

I don't really comment on profile reviews because I would get slammed for saying \"your profile pic isn't good\".But let's face it most of the sB's success is based on her looks, why do you have to sugarcoat everything and make the SD's the bad ones?",

Constructive would be looking at their photos and if they\u2019re unflattering think about what makes them so. Is it how they dress? I tell people I dress for my size and work hard on making sure what I wear flatters my body type (but doesn\u2019t necessarily hide it!) Are they not well groomed? Is the picture angle bad? Misleading? Those things are good critiques, not \u2018lose 40lbs no one would pay for that\u2019 because I assure you they will and do.",

Definitely not pushing for all reviews to only be positive or only SBs hyping each other up because although it is sweet to see, neutral criticism is still needed. I am only calling out overtly negative comments and I guess it is my fault for not stating this more explicitly.\n\nIt may be constructive criticism to you but to others it would be pointless because losing weight is a journey in itself and if someone is doing a profile review I'm guessing they're ready to start sugaring now. Not denying the importance of looks and I forget who first said it but it is important to note that the more you deviate from what is considered the standard of beauty the harder your search will be, but no need to phrase it like it is hopeless. Let them know they might be in for a lengthy search and here is some things you can add to your profile to give you a boost. (ex. smiling pics, no body deceiving pictures, a more welcoming bio and etc)\n\nDefinitely doesn't have to be sugar coated but it doesn't have to be so explicitly mean either. Again Azurecole's comment on a recent review was an example of a not sugarcoated and realistic advice.",

All an SB needs to do is avoid putting red flags all over her profile text. It's freaking wonderful when she gives you details about what dating her is like and some of her interests because then it gives us something to work with when composing a message to her. I mean, the commentary that I'm able to give on a text-only profile review largely ranges from full of red flags to no red flags. And every now and then, there's a grammatical trainwreck.",

Are relaying this message to the guy that has made sure to argue with almost every SB agreeing with me?\n\nIt's a discussion man and I have made sure to not be rude, might have overstepped that with one or too people but definitely not everyone that didn't agree with me.",

If you don't provide other perks like being somewhat handsome, that would make sex more enjoyable (and other, this one came to my mind first) then sorry . as much as some new spiring platonic SBs are delusional about SR without intimacy there a lot of SDs that simply cannot afford being SD.\nEven 300 wouldn't be ok for me unless I got a really nice perks from relationship like for example SD not having a wife, one that can host, SD being handsome. I around one who offered me allowance close to it. He's young and handsome and that makes him he can lower allowance and he is abosolutely right. \nI would gladly see an escort who is similar in look( because that's what SD care for) and ask her how much she charge. That is a good indicator for general ppm although I don't have an opinion about ppm/allowance.\nThere was a one comment on other group by SD \"she asked for 250 and I told her this is too low\" even SD knows that 250 is a very low price for intimacy date.\nSB have more to offer than an escort and it should be rewarded accordingly. \nThere is literally no saying in how much is enough but we all can say that 200 or below is just a rip off. \nI agree it ha dto be adjust to what you have in offer and what POT can offer beside $$.\nA lot of SDs complain that  allowing discussion about allowance will sky-rocket demands from POT SBs but nobody talks about how inexperienced SB is being low balled because she literally has no idea what other asks for and I don't think she will meet a generous men who will not try to take advantage of her.\nThe big question is how much you need but even if you need a little money extra, your body and time is valuable since probably you will not have intimacy with a handsome guy you would be dreaming of. That's I think escorts are a good indicator because they mostly offer intimacy and this intimacy has a price tag. I personally think sugaring should be more expesive than having an escort because SB provide more.\nOn the other hand if you find a guy who you would be vanilla date in real life I don't think most girls would stick to him without sugar involved. There is a reason why those guys are not on the platform or just look for escorts. And if they look for escort then there is a clear price. \nOf course I do not have this midnest of this much for this and this for this because it depends on my connection with the guy. \nI also personally think than sugaring in next level of escorting that's why I am so vocal about it.\n\nSo in conclusion I ask POT a lot of questions to determine what he can offer me. if there is little besides allowance/ppm, then I would demand more for each thing he doesn't provide.\nAnd the area of course. Bigger city bigger sugar.\nI am open for discussion about it but I have to start working in 10 min \ud83d\ude2d",

That leaves a lot of room for being taking advantage of and SFL of other forum will not help you. \nI have no idea who you are but if you are an SB or escort I would gladly chat with you in private.\n\nIt's a good idea tow air some time until a guy brings up topic of allowance. If they don't they are probably not experienced or trying to find the cheapest option for sex.",

The topic of escorts are discussed very often so a newbie should at least know how much escorts charge in her area to have an overall picture. It's just and only starting point.\n\nLet's take a NYC for an example. I have no idea how competitive it is and I have no idea how much guys offer there. What am I gonna do? I will go on research to find how much SW charge for their services then I check out an escort market and how competitive it is. \nCheap guys will always try to find this one girl who offers the least.

No idea how many of them eventually get someone willing to give that, how long it took on the search to find him, or if they eventually give up the search. Again this is per meet.

Its definitely rubbed me the wrong way for a while now but I felt like I couldn't articulate it well enough. I really feel this is one of the main reasons why so many of them on here are so confident and brave about the things they say. \n\nYep I actually don't care about the sex talk it just seems so funny how platonics are shamed so hard because thats not what most of them want. But if someone offers a low allowance we can't have exact discussions  or check in with other women (and even SDs) for reassurance because it may hurt some SDs feelings? Even though most SBs wouldn't want a low allowance, weird lol\n\nYes the comments were so unsettling and the fact that so many people had to baby them through how to speak to others is disturbing too.",

Plenty of men if they find you charming enough will literally pay for platonic dates and getting to know you better. Because they are a few rinsers out there all SBs must have sex on the second date...?\n\n Someone even tried to normalize \u201coh dear SBs you will be having sex with a lot of people before you find the right SD.\u201d Does that not sound like something to benefit them like the hypocrisy is insane.

Extremely large emphasis on \"not getting emotionally attached\". This to me, by definition , is sex work. WORK. It's a job. Punch in, punch out. The whole mentality turned me off and I dont go in those subs anymore. Now do connections happen that's more than physical, do you turn down clients you dont like? Of course we are all human. Nobody is a perfect emotionless sex robot.  There is clear distinction to me between sugaring and sex work. Sugaring involves emotions, kissing, and seeing 1 or 2 sds at a time. Sugaring is real relationships and real emotions. Are there shades of gray? Yes. Is someone clearly an sb or an escort / pro? Not always clear but I can pretty much tell right away now in the first few minutes of conversation.

I'm marginally more gentle with trans SBs and obese cis female SBs.\n\nWith today's rule clarification, I'm just going to sideline myself from participating in profile reviews. So to your point, yes, a lack of feedback is feedback. I've noticed that a lot of profile review threads have seen dwindling activity lately compared to a few months ago, so I suspect that other SDs are already doing the same. Still, I truly believe that it's a disservice that the only remaining feedback is an echo chamber of positivity. \n\nJust last night, there was a post where an SB announced that after failing to secure an SD and countless scams since *2016*, she was calling it quits. That's fucking depressing.\n\nI hope she just had unusually high standards. But my gut suspects that she either never got *real* feedback or that she just didn't want to accept said feedback.",

I thought that was \"just the way it is\", until I once joined an invitation-only sexwork forum that was co-ed with a respect-for-everyone ethos.  It was led by an escort (I think female leadership helped) who ruthlessly refused to take sides and demanded we respect each other.  There were some pretty eye-opening learnings on both side.  But I'm now convinced it's the only way to have a remotely un-toxic discussion forum; viz. the escort-led \"sugar\" subs to see what happens when discussion is one-sided.\n\nAs with that co-ed SW forum, I felt slf did a fantastic job of keeping mutual respect, and the fact is I learned a lot from SBs and SDs on this sub, in a way I would not have learned in an SD-only sub -- and I guarantee you new SBs are not well served by getting their advice from those trying to converge SB norms into escort norms.  We still have our moments -- I think some of yesterday's profile reviewers went out of their way to not just give honest feedback but hurt her feelings, but that's as much a failure of me as a mod to quickly bring us back to respectful-but-honest feedback.  We'll adjust, have our quarrels, but it won't turn permanently toxic and war-of-the-sexes.",

And we could play semantics about physical chemistry which is important, but I had SDs that were more than delighted to enter a SR with me. \n\nSo no, it\u2019s not constructive. Constructive would be looking at their photos and if they\u2019re unflattering think about what makes them so. Is it how they dress? I tell people I dress for my size and work hard on making sure what I wear flatters my body type (but doesn\u2019t necessarily hide it!) Are they not well groomed? Is the picture angle bad? Misleading? Those things are good critiques, not \u2018lose 40lbs no one would pay for that\u2019 because I assure you they will and do.",

Definitely not pushing for all reviews to only be positive or only SBs hyping each other up because although it is sweet to see, neutral criticism is still needed. I am only calling out overtly negative comments and I guess it is my fault for not stating this more explicitly.\n\nIt may be constructive criticism to you but to others it would be pointless because losing weight is a journey in itself and if someone is doing a profile review I'm guessing they're ready to start sugaring now. Not denying the importance of looks and I forget who first said it but it is important to note that the more you deviate from what is considered the standard of beauty the harder your search will be, but no need to phrase it like it is hopeless. Let them know they might be in for a lengthy search and here is some things you can add to your profile to give you a boost. (ex. smiling pics, no body deceiving pictures, a more welcoming bio and etc)\n\nDefinitely doesn't have to be sugar coated but it doesn't have to be so explicitly mean either.

All an SB needs to do is avoid putting red flags all over her profile text. It's freaking wonderful when she gives you details about what dating her is like and some of her interests because then it gives us something to work with when composing a message to her. I mean, the commentary that I'm able to give on a text-only profile review largely ranges from full of red flags to no red flags. And every now and then, there's a grammatical trainwreck.",

It shouldn't be labeled as coddling (based on your previous comments) because we are saying convey your message with some empathy or at least stay neutral. It doesn't have to be positive! But be mindful of how you relay your thoughts.\n\nSome SDs on profile reviews have shown that they are able to give realistic feedback without being solely negative or harsh. I guess the main issues come from people on here assuming because someone's not their type they can dictate whether that person will ever find a SD.\n\nGlad you agreed on my points, you made fair points as well.

If you don't provide other perks like being somewhat handsome, that would make sex more enjoyable (and other, this one came to my mind first) then sorry . as much as some new spiring platonic SBs are delusional about SR without intimacy there a lot of SDs that simply cannot afford being SD.\nEven 300 wouldn't be ok for me unless I got a really nice perks from relationship like for example SD not having a wife, one that can host, SD being handsome. I around one who offered me allowance close to it. He's young and handsome and that makes him he can lower allowance and he is abosolutely right. \nI would gladly see an escort who is similar in look( because that's what SD care for) and ask her how much she charge. That is a good indicator for general ppm although I don't have an opinion about ppm/allowance.\nThere was a one comment on other group by SD \"she asked for 250 and I told her this is too low\" even SD knows that 250 is a very low price for intimacy date.\nSB have more to offer than an escort and it should be rewarded accordingly. \nThere is literally no saying in how much is enough but we all can say that 200 or below is just a rip off. \nI agree it ha dto be adjust to what you have in offer and what POT can offer beside $$.\nA lot of SDs complain that  allowing discussion about allowance will sky-rocket demands from POT SBs but nobody talks about how inexperienced SB is being low balled because she literally has no idea what other asks for and I don't think she will meet a generous men who will not try to take advantage of her.\nThe big question is how much you need but even if you need a little money extra, your body and time is valuable since probably you will not have intimacy with a handsome guy you would be dreaming of. That's I think escorts are a good indicator because they mostly offer intimacy and this intimacy has a price tag. I personally think sugaring should be more expesive than having an escort because SB provide more.\nOn the other hand if you find a guy who you would be vanilla date in real life I don't think most girls would stick to him without sugar involved. There is a reason why those guys are not on the platform or just look for escorts. And if they look for escort then there is a clear price. \nOf course I do not have this midnest of this much for this and this for this because it depends on my connection with the guy. \nI also personally think than sugaring in next level of escorting that's why I am so vocal about it.\n\nSo in conclusion I ask POT a lot of questions to determine what he can offer me. if there is little besides allowance/ppm, then I would demand more for each thing he doesn't provide.\nAnd the area of course. Bigger city bigger sugar.\nI am open for discussion about it but I have to start working in 10 min \ud83d\ude2d",

You can reach out to other girls here in DM or do research o your own on internet or try to connect with one of the girls from your city on SA. The other option is simply talk to a lot of guys( even if you are not interested in them) and ask them after having some conversation, how much would they offer a SB, even if it's not you. \nI am form another continent and I had no idea what to ask for. That leaves a lot of room for being taking advantage of and SFL of other forum will not help you. \nI have no idea who you are but if you are an SB or escort I would gladly chat with you in private.\n\nIt's a good idea tow air some time until a guy brings up topic of allowance. If they don't they are probably not experienced or trying to find the cheapest option for sex.",

The topic of escorts are discussed very often so a newbie should at least know how much escorts charge in her area to have an overall picture. It's just and only starting point.\n\nLet's take a NYC for an example. I have no idea how competitive it is and I have no idea how much guys offer there. What am I gonna do? I will go on research to find how much SW charge for their services then I check out an escort market and how competitive it is. \nCheap guys will always try to find this one girl who offers the least.

Extremely large emphasis on \"not getting emotionally attached\". This to me, by definition , is sex work. WORK. It's a job. Punch in, punch out. The whole mentality turned me off and I dont go in those subs anymore. Now do connections happen that's more than physical, do you turn down clients you dont like? Of course we are all human. Nobody is a perfect emotionless sex robot.  There is clear distinction to me between sugaring and sex work. Sugaring involves emotions, kissing, and seeing 1 or 2 sds at a time. Sugaring is real relationships and real emotions. Are there shades of gray? Yes. Is someone clearly an sb or an escort / pro? Not always clear but I can pretty much tell right away now in the first few minutes of conversation.

All an SB needs to do is avoid putting red flags all over her profile text. It's freaking wonderful when she gives you details about what dating her is like and some of her interests because then it gives us something to work with when composing a message to her. I mean, the commentary that I'm able to give on a text-only profile review largely ranges from full of red flags to no red flags. And every now and then, there's a grammatical trainwreck.",

If you don't provide other perks like being somewhat handsome, that would make sex more enjoyable (and other, this one came to my mind first) then sorry . as much as some new spiring platonic SBs are delusional about SR without intimacy there a lot of SDs that simply cannot afford being SD.\nEven 300 wouldn't be ok for me unless I got a really nice perks from relationship like for example SD not having a wife, one that can host, SD being handsome. I around one who offered me allowance close to it. He's young and handsome and that makes him he can lower allowance and he is abosolutely right. \nI would gladly see an escort who is similar in look( because that's what SD care for) and ask her how much she charge. That is a good indicator for general ppm although I don't have an opinion about ppm/allowance.\nThere was a one comment on other group by SD \"she asked for 250 and I told her this is too low\" even SD knows that 250 is a very low price for intimacy date.\nSB have more to offer than an escort and it should be rewarded accordingly. \nThere is literally no saying in how much is enough but we all can say that 200 or below is just a rip off. \nI agree it ha dto be adjust to what you have in offer and what POT can offer beside $$.\nA lot of SDs complain that  allowing discussion about allowance will sky-rocket demands from POT SBs but nobody talks about how inexperienced SB is being low balled because she literally has no idea what other asks for and I don't think she will meet a generous men who will not try to take advantage of her.\nThe big question is how much you need but even if you need a little money extra, your body and time is valuable since probably you will not have intimacy with a handsome guy you would be dreaming of. That's I think escorts are a good indicator because they mostly offer intimacy and this intimacy has a price tag. I personally think sugaring should be more expesive than having an escort because SB provide more.\nOn the other hand if you find a guy who you would be vanilla date in real life I don't think most girls would stick to him without sugar involved. There is a reason why those guys are not on the platform or just look for escorts. And if they look for escort then there is a clear price. \nOf course I do not have this midnest of this much for this and this for this because it depends on my connection with the guy. \nI also personally think than sugaring in next level of escorting that's why I am so vocal about it.\n\nSo in conclusion I ask POT a lot of questions to determine what he can offer me. if there is little besides allowance/ppm, then I would demand more for each thing he doesn't provide.\nAnd the area of course. Bigger city bigger sugar.\nI am open for discussion about it but I have to start working in 10 min \ud83d\ude2d",

It's just and only starting point.\n\nLet's take a NYC for an example. I have no idea how competitive it is and I have no idea how much guys offer there. What am I gonna do? I will go on research to find how much SW charge for their services then I check out an escort market and how competitive it is. \nCheap guys will always try to find this one girl who offers the least.

The main incentive is money per hour / minute of service , this is seen as a job. And second rule, no emotions, no kissing. I would read constant posts about how to turn off emotions and be robotic in physical activities, how to zone out and get it over with. Extremely large emphasis on \"not getting emotionally attached\". This to me, by definition , is sex work. WORK. It's a job. Punch in, punch out. The whole mentality turned me off and I dont go in those subs anymore. Now do connections happen that's more than physical, do you turn down clients you dont like? Of course we are all human. Nobody is a perfect emotionless sex robot.  There is clear distinction to me between sugaring and sex work. Sugaring involves emotions, kissing, and seeing 1 or 2 sds at a time. Sugaring is real relationships and real emotions. Are there shades of gray? Yes. Is someone clearly an sb or an escort / pro? Not always clear but I can pretty much tell right away now in the first few minutes of conversation. Nothing against escorts more power to ya but stay off of SR sites so we dont get our shit shut down.",

If we're talking about the same profile review, that was direct commentary about the style of her photos.\n\nI think most SDs have at least dabbled in the escort world. It doesn't take very long to learn the lingo and catch on to various \"styles\" of escort ads. If someone is trying to attract SDs (as opposed to Johns), I would think it's helpful to know that her pics are red flags.",

The other option is simply talk to a lot of guys( even if you are not interested in them) and ask them after having some conversation, how much would they offer a SB, even if it's not you. \nI am form another continent and I had no idea what to ask for. That leaves a lot of room for being taking advantage of and SFL of other forum will not help you. \nI have no idea who you are but if you are an SB or escort I would gladly chat with you in private.\n\nIt's a good idea tow air some time until a guy brings up topic of allowance.

I turn down clients all the time. I turn down second dates all the time. Why? If I\u2019m getting the money and it\u2019s my only incentive, why turn down money?! Is it because maybe we get more from it than cash? Or maybe because despite your best efforts to pigeonhole us, we\u2019re not a monolith and may have more than one reason for our work?",

The main incentive is money per hour / minute of service , this is seen as a job. And second rule, no emotions, no kissing. I would read constant posts about how to turn off emotions and be robotic in physical activities, how to zone out and get it over with. Extremely large emphasis on \"not getting emotionally attached\". This to me, by definition , is sex work. WORK. It's a job. Punch in, punch out. The whole mentality turned me off and I dont go in those subs anymore. Now do connections happen that's more than physical, do you turn down clients you dont like? Of course we are all human. Nobody is a perfect emotionless sex robot.  There is clear distinction to me between sugaring and sex work. Sugaring involves emotions, kissing, and seeing 1 or 2 sds at a time. Sugaring is real relationships and real emotions. Are there shades of gray? Yes. Is someone clearly an sb or an escort / pro? Not always clear but I can pretty much tell right away now in the first few minutes of conversation. Nothing against escorts more power to ya but stay off of SR sites so we dont get our shit shut down.",

I would read constant posts about how to turn off emotions and be robotic in physical activities, how to zone out and get it over with. Extremely large emphasis on \"not getting emotionally attached\". This to me, by definition , is sex work. WORK. It's a job. Punch in, punch out. The whole mentality turned me off and I dont go in those subs anymore. Now do connections happen that's more than physical, do you turn down clients you dont like? Of course we are all human. Nobody is a perfect emotionless sex robot.  There is clear distinction to me between sugaring and sex work. Sugaring involves emotions, kissing, and seeing 1 or 2 sds at a time. Sugaring is real relationships and real emotions. Are there shades of gray? Yes. Is someone clearly an sb or an escort / pro? Not always clear but I can pretty much tell right away now in the first few minutes of conversation. Nothing against escorts more power to ya but stay off of SR sites so we dont get our shit shut down.",

Are relaying this message to the guy that has made sure to argue with almost every SB agreeing with me?\n\nIt's a discussion man and I have made sure to not be rude, might have overstepped that with one or too people but definitely not everyone that didn't agree with me.",

In my location the government keeps track of rents, and the average rent for the city is freely available. It might be too for your city. For escorts, you need to find a good source of information like a website we're usually escorts state their prices and services and see yourself. I guess if you are in a country were prostitution is legal there might exists some official stats. Again this is heavily location dependant.",
