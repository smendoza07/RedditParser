    "body": "So I saw some SDs don\u2019t like talking $$$ before the M&G but you know how much time us SBs would waste if we did that???\nDo you know how much POT SDs we would have to meet / turn down just to find the right one ???\nAnd do you know how many POT has hit us with a low ass numbers ??? \n\nSo I don\u2019t understand. I\u2019m not wasting my time going on daily M&Gs. Not only wasting gas, my time AND energy to hear a low ass number. Because again that\u2019s all we come across.   \nBecause I\u2019m standing up and leaving. \n\nBut my time that I just wasted. ??? Now I have to go and M&G until how many more times this happens ???\n\nSo it\u2019s illogical really. I won\u2019t waste my time on a SD that won\u2019t say at least an estimate , or give an idea. \nI just won\u2019t. \n\n\nAlso how come you can speak on what you\u2019re getting out of this \u2026 but wait when it comes to SBS we have to WAIT to hear what y\u2019all are willing to give. \nIt\u2019s illogical and doesn\u2019t make sense. Maybe for SDs it does because they are more likely to find someone.\nBut for us SBs ??? No. Sorry. Next.\n\n\nEdit : \n I will not settle for a man who isn\u2019t comfortable telling me what he\u2019s willing to give for my valuable time and energy. I know exactly what I am looking for. \nIt\u2019s just wasting time if you really want me to sit here and M&G over 200+ ppl who message me .\n\nAnother edit ; Most of these \u201cSDs \u201c need to learn to stop being time wasters. We\u2019re not only here for the money but if our financial expectations don\u2019t match then there isn\u2019t anything else to talk about.",

They say things like, \"My previous SB's were VERY satisfied\" and \"I will take care of you\" and refuse to not give us a set number. They say this to charm us, lower our guard, and get us to meet them, thinking their awesome personality will make us agree to a Benjamin per meet in a cheap hotel. You are not giving SB's enough credit for stating their terms, and SD's too much credit when it's not perhaps deserved.",

If you wanna discuss it, bring it up. If he doesn't want to, next him. I actually met my newest SD without discussing numbers recently and he has been my most generous by far - but he wasn't from SA and it was also a risk. I know 80% of the time it will result in wasted time but from looking him up I knew he was wealthy and made the calculated risk. I can't do that for most men on SA, most of whom are not rich, and therefore am less willing to meet although like I said, everyone has the right to want to do things their own way.\n\n>If a woman was only willing to do \"partial\" intimacy, I wouldnt instantly rule it out, or feel like my time was wasted, though I would make an offer in line with what she is suggesting\n\nInteresting. You are in the extreme minority of SD's in that case. It is not hounding to want to know whether she is willing to enter a sexual relationship with you, if that is not made clear in her profile.",

There are plently of women on seeking who place emotional and physical compatibility over getting their perfect allowance, and some even willing to go vanilla. For those women, many of them are very flexible on an amount, and would not feel their time was wasted if they didnt get their perfect offer they had in mind, and theres always the chance the offer may be better than they expected. I would say this number of women far dwarfs the amount of men who are looking for platonic. Theres even been polls here where a non insignificant amount of women said theyd take half their normal from a guy they were highly attracted to. Youd be hard pressed to find even a handful of guys willing to do purely platonic here. \n\nI would say that the analogy does not adequately address the fact that their are many women with flexible numbers depending on the guy, the fact that there are many women without hardline requirements, and the fact that there are a noninsignificsnt amount kf women also willing to go vanilla.\n\n\nBtw, I tell them I am looking for physical intimacy, but I do not get anymore specific then that, asking about specific acts for example.  The same way I say I offer financial help, but will not get into specific numbers until meeting.\n\nAlso, no I dont agree you can just equate an offer you dont like to a suprise platonic as stated in the intial analogy, as one is still an offer of mutual sugar, the other is not. You just decided the offer wasnt good enough for you. Which was the crux of my rebuttal. \n\nIts like saying \"Being offered food from your local diner instead of a 5 star resturant is the same as being offered no food at all\". Its just not.",

The rest of the process is up to the SB. Based on the conversations I\u2019ve had with SB\u2019s they have to filter through many more a-holes, posers, collectors, creeps, salts and scammers then I ever have. If they want to cover $$ or anything else, I\u2019m happy to. I can manage my reputation and anonymity well enough to not get overly concerned.

They're parasites sucking the joy out of the lifestyle.  Be pessimistic.  If a POT refuses to discuss the financial aspect when you bring it up, recognize he isn't a SD and let it go before you've invested too much time in him.  Don't go meet him and attempt to make it work.  It isn't your job to convert a POT into a SD.  It's your job to filter through POTs to find a SD.  If they give you a hint that they aren't a SD, take the hint and cut them loose. Us actual SDs need to do the same thing with POTs.  Most aren't SBs these days, and we need to filter through the masses to find the real SBs.",

In time I\u2019ve refined my ability to scope out the type of SDs who can provide it and my rate of failure has decreased- lol. My reasoning is that, from a SDs perspective, I wouldn\u2019t want to commit to such a high allowance without meeting first because the girl could look significantly different from her photos, the chemistry might not be there, our schedules might not match up, among other reasons. Not to mention that I personally don\u2019t want to risk talking numbers on the site/over text and run the risk of being charged with prostitution. And honestly, I wouldn\u2019t dare ask someone for that much without showing face and proving why my appearance, personality, and willingness to adapt to what my SD is looking for, makes my companionship is worth it. I\u2019m careful to select POTs whose profile reflects the ability to provide such an allowance and watch carefully for any red flags during our communication leading up the M&G. \n\nI\u2019ve found all my great SDs without discussing allowance prior to the M&G.",

No problem, I at least get to practice my resilience, assertivity and ability to keep the ball in the air ( metaphorically speaking, you naughty..)\n- with every other guy who was not a fit I was closer to perfecting my veting and learning to spot the archetypes\n- always close to work, max 10 mins walking (city centre\n- always in a nice place I already know ( so I have business meetings there and age gap is nothing awkward, plus staff can help if shit goes sideways)\n- discussing money, contracts and difficult situations in both topics is my daily bread, very unlikely any SD could surprise me to the point I would lose my composure\n- I knew I will be on par with salary to many of them (unlike them, I dont have other means of income tho)\n- I know the approximate salary ranges across multiple fields, so if they are Mr Corporate - easy  \ud83d\ude00. Also, vast majority of info will not be shared via chat, rather F2F so it helps paint a better picture \n- not requesting but recieving gift is a great indication of generosity.\n\n\nWhile I understand, why it makes sense to ask for something as an SB, it also looks tacky for the SDs and that's worth mentioning. What I am trying to say is, that the generous guy is going to try to be accomodation to your schedule, location etc and probably offer a little token - but you will not know this, if you are an entitled princess waiting with your hand spread hoping to be recognised and gifted. \n\nAlso, I make sure to look my most presentable every morning, so if there is a date, only minor corrections are to be made. I really don't know why would you spend 2 hrs prep time for M&G, sounds like an overcomplication (or alibism to justify meet fee).",

As long as I decide to go forward with the arrangement, I'm going to provide roughly the same amount, no matter what,  The number is not going to change at the M&G. For me, the reason for M&G is to decide whether to go forward, and looking for red flags, not whether I'm going to raise or lower my amount by xxx.\n\nOddly, there are a fair amount of POT SBs who stop texting when I bring up the money conversation. They are uncomfortable with it and ghost. Perhaps it's because of the rebranding of seeking, but more likely it's because there are too many johns offering \"ppm\" for a one night stand, or they are toe dippers who book at the first mention of terms of an arrangement. Ppm is money for each meeting in an ongoing arrangement, not money for one single meeting to notch a belt. Whichever way, I'm happy they ghost early so I don't waste any time with them.",

The second one agreed to see me three times as many times if I gave her while she wanted, The third one we just couldn\u2019t come to agreement, because what she wanted slightly more than what I would give for four dates and she wanted to it for 1-2 dates a month, I looking for it and I am looking for an SGF that I can see once or twice a week, not once or twice a month.\n\nAlso on average at least three out of four women I meet want to start an arrangement.

Well first of all, I AM thinking of what's better for me, just like you're thinking about what's better for you.  Your entire post is about what's better for **you**, without thinking of the SD.  You're thinking this is somehow bad?\n\nStill, offering allowance after the video call IS better for the SB.  How?\n\n1. I do not offer the top end of my allowance range if I have no idea what the other person is like.   **If we have a video call and I really like her, she'll get offered my top offer.**  If she insists I give her an offer before a video call, she'll get the low end of my range.   **So doing it my way is better for the SB.**\n2. If we do a video call and I don't like her, I cancel the M&G, saving her time.  **So that's better for the SB**.  If we do a video call and she doesn't like me, we don't have a M&G.  **So that's better for the SB**.  If we don't match on allowance we cancel the M&G, **so that's better for the SB** and I -- we only had to do a quick low-effort call to figure this all out.\n3. We both go to the M&G excited to meet, knowing we are already a match on allowance,  neither of us is going to ghost (ghosting is common if there's no video call; uncommon if there is a video call first).  **So that's better for the SB.**\n\nIn short, although doing it my way (offer allowance AFTER a video call but BEFORE the M&G) is what's best for me, **it also happens to be what's best for the SB.**",

I just know that nearly all SBs go along with it, that once I added in video calls it's made my search 1000x more efficient, that SBs I desire get my higher offers because of it, and SBs I don't desire (or who don't desire me) don't have to waste time on an in-person M&G.\n\nNote that for me personally, I believe it's the SB's prerogative to bring up allowance whenever she wants.  So if an SB wants to discuss allowance before she commits to a video call, as far as I'm concerned that's what we'll do.  I just don't offer the same to someone I have nothing invested in and haven't seen live, but if she's happy with what I offer, that's fantastic and we can move on to the video call or M&G.",

If you want to broach the topic before we meet that's fine but you better damn well be able to articulate your wants and needs, as well as share what you're bringing to the table. A pretty smile only goes so far. Every single POT who wanted to talk about sugar before meeting hasn't been worth the asking price.\n\nI've been living in and around the bowl for twenty years.

I don't care about the troubles of you having to get dressed for this or that.\n\nNow as I've said before the quickest way for a woman to get lowballed is to talk about money before meeting.

I pay more when I've meet a lady in person first.  \n\n\nGo ahead and downvote. This goes against all the talk about \"chemistry and connection\".

They need you to meet their rate;  and then they wanted to meet you.  \n\nBut, there are absolutely a certain group of women on seeking.  There account ages are typically around 4 - 8 months.  They started sugaring - with likely too many \"high ideas\" - and had guys take advantage of them.  Run into a lot of guys just wanting vanilla relationships.  And have now fallen into asking about money very early on... to make sure the answer isn't... \"WTF?  You want money!!!!?  Your a prostitute!\". \n\nWhat I try to judge it on - is how much conversation they are interested in before meeting - beyond money.\n\nIf all they care about is the money, and then want to meet?  Nope, I'm out.  Same experience you've had.\n\nOthers, I've had... \"oh, wow, yeah, that's awesome.  I've just run into so many guys that weren't willing to help out at all.  So tell me more about XXX\".  And it goes a lot better.",

They think I am paying a weekly allowance/ppm for a couple of hours? No. that is not a SR/SB. That is a paid hook up. \n\nAssuming X is the standard for what we know.

Wasnt something I anticipated being a big deal. We werent compatible, things happen. If a woman is holding on to her standards and holding out for the guy she's a match for, im sure youd give her nothing but praise. \n\nWhat do SDs get when its a next due to incompatibility? Nothing. So I dont feel bad about not giving them anything more on top of a meal, nice conversation and time out of my day to meet them. \n\nIf women dont think its worth it, they shouldnt do it. But the fact I have no problem finding girls willing, means they think its worth it. Otherwise they wouldnt do it.",

They say things like, \"My previous SB's were VERY satisfied\" and \"I will take care of you\" and refuse to not give us a set number. They say this to charm us, lower our guard, and get us to meet them, thinking their awesome personality will make us agree to a Benjamin per meet in a cheap hotel.

If you wanna discuss it, bring it up. If he doesn't want to, next him. I actually met my newest SD without discussing numbers recently and he has been my most generous by far - but he wasn't from SA and it was also a risk. I know 80% of the time it will result in wasted time but from looking him up I knew he was wealthy and made the calculated risk. I can't do that for most men on SA, most of whom are not rich, and therefore am less willing to meet although like I said, everyone has the right to want to do things their own way.\n\n>If a woman was only willing to do \"partial\" intimacy, I wouldnt instantly rule it out, or feel like my time was wasted, though I would make an offer in line with what she is suggesting\n\nInteresting. You are in the extreme minority of SD's in that case. It is not hounding to want to know whether she is willing to enter a sexual relationship with you, if that is not made clear in her profile.",

There are plently of women on seeking who place emotional and physical compatibility over getting their perfect allowance, and some even willing to go vanilla. For those women, many of them are very flexible on an amount, and would not feel their time was wasted if they didnt get their perfect offer they had in mind, and theres always the chance the offer may be better than they expected. I would say this number of women far dwarfs the amount of men who are looking for platonic. Theres even been polls here where a non insignificant amount of women said theyd take half their normal from a guy they were highly attracted to. Youd be hard pressed to find even a handful of guys willing to do purely platonic here. \n\nI would say that the analogy does not adequately address the fact that their are many women with flexible numbers depending on the guy, the fact that there are many women without hardline requirements, and the fact that there are a noninsignificsnt amount kf women also willing to go vanilla.\n\n\nBtw, I tell them I am looking for physical intimacy, but I do not get anymore specific then that, asking about specific acts for example.  The same way I say I offer financial help, but will not get into specific numbers until meeting.\n\nAlso, no I dont agree you can just equate an offer you dont like to a suprise platonic as stated in the intial analogy, as one is still an offer of mutual sugar, the other is not. You just decided the offer wasnt good enough for you. Which was the crux of my rebuttal. \n\nIts like saying \"Being offered food from your local diner instead of a 5 star resturant is the same as being offered no food at all\". Its just not.",

Having a set number of how many times you have sex per meeting, and how long the meeting will last, sounds like you would be happier chosing from a list of services. A real sugar relationship should be natural on both sides. What you describe is the opposite of that.",

Well first of all, I AM thinking of what's better for me, just like you're thinking about what's better for you.  Your entire post is about what's better for **you**, without thinking of the SD.  You're thinking this is somehow bad?\n\nStill, offering allowance after the video call IS better for the SB.  How?\n\n1. I do not offer the top end of my allowance range if I have no idea what the other person is like.   **If we have a video call and I really like her, she'll get offered my top offer.**  If she insists I give her an offer before a video call, she'll get the low end of my range.   **So doing it my way is better for the SB.**\n2. If we do a video call and I don't like her, I cancel the M&G, saving her time.  **So that's better for the SB**.  If we do a video call and she doesn't like me, we don't have a M&G.  **So that's better for the SB**.  If we don't match on allowance we cancel the M&G, **so that's better for the SB** and I -- we only had to do a quick low-effort call to figure this all out.\n3. We both go to the M&G excited to meet, knowing we are already a match on allowance,  neither of us is going to ghost (ghosting is common if there's no video call; uncommon if there is a video call first).  **So that's better for the SB.**\n\nIn short, although doing it my way (offer allowance AFTER a video call but BEFORE the M&G) is what's best for me, **it also happens to be what's best for the SB.**",

This method makes sense and I\u2019m not coming after it but if someone doesnt know the options how can they give a proper thoughtful decision ? As much as it\u2019s an investment of your time and energy it\u2019s an investment in mine and since I\u2019ve started this journey with you clearly I am willing to gamble the investment why not be transparent and honest ? Maybe I just got off a string of bad video calls that wasted my time and energy and I don\u2019t want to do another one I just want to get to the logistics and to the fun getting ready for the M&G part. I for one put a lot of mental and emotional energy into each connection I make because I\u2019m just an all or nothing gal but in being that vulnerable I am also expecting that in return ! Reciprocation is sexier than any amount someone could offer me. Imo.",

I just know that nearly all SBs go along with it, that once I added in video calls it's made my search 1000x more efficient, that SBs I desire get my higher offers because of it, and SBs I don't desire (or who don't desire me) don't have to waste time on an in-person M&G.\n\nNote that for me personally, I believe it's the SB's prerogative to bring up allowance whenever she wants.  So if an SB wants to discuss allowance before she commits to a video call, as far as I'm concerned that's what we'll do.  I just don't offer the same to someone I have nothing invested in and haven't seen live, but if she's happy with what I offer, that's fantastic and we can move on to the video call or M&G.",

They are too focused on the $$ part instead of being a good SB.\n\nMy perspective, you can normally thread the needle a bit more on this one.  \n\nSome women - yes, that's all they care about.  They need you to meet their rate;  and then they wanted to meet you.  \n\nBut, there are absolutely a certain group of women on seeking.  There account ages are typically around 4 - 8 months.  They started sugaring - with likely too many \"high ideas\" - and had guys take advantage of them.  Run into a lot of guys just wanting vanilla relationships.  And have now fallen into asking about money very early on... to make sure the answer isn't... \"WTF?  You want money!!!!?  Your a prostitute!\". \n\nWhat I try to judge it on - is how much conversation they are interested in before meeting - beyond money.\n\nIf all they care about is the money, and then want to meet?  Nope, I'm out.  Same experience you've had.\n\nOthers, I've had... \"oh, wow, yeah, that's awesome.  I've just run into so many guys that weren't willing to help out at all.

They think I am paying a weekly allowance/ppm for a couple of hours? No. that is not a SR/SB. That is a paid hook up. \n\nAssuming X is the standard for what we know.

Wasnt something I anticipated being a big deal. We werent compatible, things happen. If a woman is holding on to her standards and holding out for the guy she's a match for, im sure youd give her nothing but praise. \n\nWhat do SDs get when its a next due to incompatibility? Nothing. So I dont feel bad about not giving them anything more on top of a meal, nice conversation and time out of my day to meet them. \n\nIf women dont think its worth it, they shouldnt do it. But the fact I have no problem finding girls willing, means they think its worth it. Otherwise they wouldnt do it.",

I know 80% of the time it will result in wasted time but from looking him up I knew he was wealthy and made the calculated risk. I can't do that for most men on SA, most of whom are not rich, and therefore am less willing to meet although like I said, everyone has the right to want to do things their own way.\n\n>If a woman was only willing to do \"partial\" intimacy, I wouldnt instantly rule it out, or feel like my time was wasted, though I would make an offer in line with what she is suggesting\n\nInteresting. You are in the extreme minority of SD's in that case. It is not hounding to want to know whether she is willing to enter a sexual relationship with you, if that is not made clear in her profile.",

There are plently of women on seeking who place emotional and physical compatibility over getting their perfect allowance, and some even willing to go vanilla. For those women, many of them are very flexible on an amount, and would not feel their time was wasted if they didnt get their perfect offer they had in mind, and theres always the chance the offer may be better than they expected. I would say this number of women far dwarfs the amount of men who are looking for platonic. Theres even been polls here where a non insignificant amount of women said theyd take half their normal from a guy they were highly attracted to. Youd be hard pressed to find even a handful of guys willing to do purely platonic here. \n\nI would say that the analogy does not adequately address the fact that their are many women with flexible numbers depending on the guy, the fact that there are many women without hardline requirements, and the fact that there are a noninsignificsnt amount kf women also willing to go vanilla.\n\n\nBtw, I tell them I am looking for physical intimacy, but I do not get anymore specific then that, asking about specific acts for example.  The same way I say I offer financial help, but will not get into specific numbers until meeting.\n\nAlso, no I dont agree you can just equate an offer you dont like to a suprise platonic as stated in the intial analogy, as one is still an offer of mutual sugar, the other is not. You just decided the offer wasnt good enough for you.

Well first of all, I AM thinking of what's better for me, just like you're thinking about what's better for you.  Your entire post is about what's better for **you**, without thinking of the SD.  You're thinking this is somehow bad?\n\nStill, offering allowance after the video call IS better for the SB.  How?\n\n1. I do not offer the top end of my allowance range if I have no idea what the other person is like.   **If we have a video call and I really like her, she'll get offered my top offer.**  If she insists I give her an offer before a video call, she'll get the low end of my range.   **So doing it my way is better for the SB.**\n2. If we do a video call and I don't like her, I cancel the M&G, saving her time.  **So that's better for the SB**.  If we do a video call and she doesn't like me, we don't have a M&G.  **So that's better for the SB**.  If we don't match on allowance we cancel the M&G, **so that's better for the SB** and I -- we only had to do a quick low-effort call to figure this all out.\n3. We both go to the M&G excited to meet, knowing we are already a match on allowance,  neither of us is going to ghost (ghosting is common if there's no video call; uncommon if there is a video call first).  **So that's better for the SB.**\n\nIn short, although doing it my way (offer allowance AFTER a video call but BEFORE the M&G) is what's best for me, **it also happens to be what's best for the SB.**",

Maybe I just got off a string of bad video calls that wasted my time and energy and I don\u2019t want to do another one I just want to get to the logistics and to the fun getting ready for the M&G part. I for one put a lot of mental and emotional energy into each connection I make because I\u2019m just an all or nothing gal but in being that vulnerable I am also expecting that in return !

I just know that nearly all SBs go along with it, that once I added in video calls it's made my search 1000x more efficient, that SBs I desire get my higher offers because of it, and SBs I don't desire (or who don't desire me) don't have to waste time on an in-person M&G.\n\nNote that for me personally, I believe it's the SB's prerogative to bring up allowance whenever she wants.  So if an SB wants to discuss allowance before she commits to a video call, as far as I'm concerned that's what we'll do.  I just don't offer the same to someone I have nothing invested in and haven't seen live, but if she's happy with what I offer, that's fantastic and we can move on to the video call or M&G.",

You seem to like this game too much. \n\nA '2 hour date' is what about 50% of these new SBs thing an arrangement is. They think I am paying a weekly allowance/ppm for a couple of hours? No. that is not a SR/SB. That is a paid hook up. \n\nAssuming X is the standard for what we know. How man x's per week or per vist or per month. x,xxx? xx,xxx? Are you wanting xx,xxx per month? or what? Why does the SD hve to play 20 questions? Just give him your amount you are happy with?\n\nWaiting around for your magic number is probably not going to happen right away. Since you are coming here posting about it. I know it has not.",

Wasnt something I anticipated being a big deal. We werent compatible, things happen. If a woman is holding on to her standards and holding out for the guy she's a match for, im sure youd give her nothing but praise. \n\nWhat do SDs get when its a next due to incompatibility? Nothing. So I dont feel bad about not giving them anything more on top of a meal, nice conversation and time out of my day to meet them. \n\nIf women dont think its worth it, they shouldnt do it. But the fact I have no problem finding girls willing, means they think its worth it. Otherwise they wouldnt do it.",

If he doesn't want to, next him. I actually met my newest SD without discussing numbers recently and he has been my most generous by far - but he wasn't from SA and it was also a risk. I know 80% of the time it will result in wasted time but from looking him up I knew he was wealthy and made the calculated risk. I can't do that for most men on SA, most of whom are not rich, and therefore am less willing to meet although like I said, everyone has the right to want to do things their own way.\n\n>If a woman was only willing to do \"partial\" intimacy, I wouldnt instantly rule it out, or feel like my time was wasted, though I would make an offer in line with what she is suggesting\n\nInteresting. You are in the extreme minority of SD's in that case. It is not hounding to want to know whether she is willing to enter a sexual relationship with you, if that is not made clear in her profile.",

There are plently of women on seeking who place emotional and physical compatibility over getting their perfect allowance, and some even willing to go vanilla. For those women, many of them are very flexible on an amount, and would not feel their time was wasted if they didnt get their perfect offer they had in mind, and theres always the chance the offer may be better than they expected. I would say this number of women far dwarfs the amount of men who are looking for platonic. Theres even been polls here where a non insignificant amount of women said theyd take half their normal from a guy they were highly attracted to. Youd be hard pressed to find even a handful of guys willing to do purely platonic here. \n\nI would say that the analogy does not adequately address the fact that their are many women with flexible numbers depending on the guy, the fact that there are many women without hardline requirements, and the fact that there are a noninsignificsnt amount kf women also willing to go vanilla.\n\n\nBtw, I tell them I am looking for physical intimacy, but I do not get anymore specific then that, asking about specific acts for example.  The same way I say I offer financial help, but will not get into specific numbers until meeting.\n\nAlso, no I dont agree you can just equate an offer you dont like to a suprise platonic as stated in the intial analogy, as one is still an offer of mutual sugar, the other is not. You just decided the offer wasnt good enough for you. Which was the crux of my rebuttal. \n\nIts like saying \"Being offered food from your local diner instead of a 5 star resturant is the same as being offered no food at all\". Its just not.",

I just know that nearly all SBs go along with it, that once I added in video calls it's made my search 1000x more efficient, that SBs I desire get my higher offers because of it, and SBs I don't desire (or who don't desire me) don't have to waste time on an in-person M&G.\n\nNote that for me personally, I believe it's the SB's prerogative to bring up allowance whenever she wants.  So if an SB wants to discuss allowance before she commits to a video call, as far as I'm concerned that's what we'll do.  I just don't offer the same to someone I have nothing invested in and haven't seen live, but if she's happy with what I offer, that's fantastic and we can move on to the video call or M&G.",

You seem to like this game too much. \n\nA '2 hour date' is what about 50% of these new SBs thing an arrangement is. They think I am paying a weekly allowance/ppm for a couple of hours? No. that is not a SR/SB. That is a paid hook up. \n\nAssuming X is the standard for what we know. How man x's per week or per vist or per month. x,xxx? xx,xxx? Are you wanting xx,xxx per month? or what? Why does the SD hve to play 20 questions? Just give him your amount you are happy with?\n\nWaiting around for your magic number is probably not going to happen right away. Since you are coming here posting about it. I know it has not.",

If he doesn't want to, next him. I actually met my newest SD without discussing numbers recently and he has been my most generous by far - but he wasn't from SA and it was also a risk. I know 80% of the time it will result in wasted time but from looking him up I knew he was wealthy and made the calculated risk. I can't do that for most men on SA, most of whom are not rich, and therefore am less willing to meet although like I said, everyone has the right to want to do things their own way.\n\n>If a woman was only willing to do \"partial\" intimacy, I wouldnt instantly rule it out, or feel like my time was wasted, though I would make an offer in line with what she is suggesting\n\nInteresting. You are in the extreme minority of SD's in that case. It is not hounding to want to know whether she is willing to enter a sexual relationship with you, if that is not made clear in her profile.",

There are plently of women on seeking who place emotional and physical compatibility over getting their perfect allowance, and some even willing to go vanilla. For those women, many of them are very flexible on an amount, and would not feel their time was wasted if they didnt get their perfect offer they had in mind, and theres always the chance the offer may be better than they expected. I would say this number of women far dwarfs the amount of men who are looking for platonic. Theres even been polls here where a non insignificant amount of women said theyd take half their normal from a guy they were highly attracted to. Youd be hard pressed to find even a handful of guys willing to do purely platonic here. \n\nI would say that the analogy does not adequately address the fact that their are many women with flexible numbers depending on the guy, the fact that there are many women without hardline requirements, and the fact that there are a noninsignificsnt amount kf women also willing to go vanilla.\n\n\nBtw, I tell them I am looking for physical intimacy, but I do not get anymore specific then that, asking about specific acts for example.  The same way I say I offer financial help, but will not get into specific numbers until meeting.\n\nAlso, no I dont agree you can just equate an offer you dont like to a suprise platonic as stated in the intial analogy, as one is still an offer of mutual sugar, the other is not. You just decided the offer wasnt good enough for you. Which was the crux of my rebuttal. \n\nIts like saying \"Being offered food from your local diner instead of a 5 star resturant is the same as being offered no food at all\". Its just not.",

So if an SB wants to discuss allowance before she commits to a video call, as far as I'm concerned that's what we'll do.  I just don't offer the same to someone I have nothing invested in and haven't seen live, but if she's happy with what I offer, that's fantastic and we can move on to the video call or M&G.",

            "body": "I would say its not baseless, but rather based on subjective opinion. There are plently of women on seeking who place emotional and physical compatibility over getting their perfect allowance, and some even willing to go vanilla. For those women, many of them are very flexible on an amount, and would not feel their time was wasted if they didnt get their perfect offer they had in mind, and theres always the chance the offer may be better than they expected. I would say this number of women far dwarfs the amount of men who are looking for platonic. Theres even been polls here where a non insignificant amount of women said theyd take half their normal from a guy they were highly attracted to. Youd be hard pressed to find even a handful of guys willing to do purely platonic here. \n\nI would say that the analogy does not adequately address the fact that their are many women with flexible numbers depending on the guy, the fact that there are many women without hardline requirements, and the fact that there are a noninsignificsnt amount kf women also willing to go vanilla.\n\n\nBtw, I tell them I am looking for physical intimacy, but I do not get anymore specific then that, asking about specific acts for example.  The same way I say I offer financial help, but will not get into specific numbers until meeting.\n\nAlso, no I dont agree you can just equate an offer you dont like to a suprise platonic as stated in the intial analogy, as one is still an offer of mutual sugar, the other is not. You just decided the offer wasnt good enough for you. Which was the crux of my rebuttal. \n\nIts like saying \"Being offered food from your local diner instead of a 5 star resturant is the same as being offered no food at all\". Its just not.",

You seem to like this game too much. \n\nA '2 hour date' is what about 50% of these new SBs thing an arrangement is. They think I am paying a weekly allowance/ppm for a couple of hours? No. that is not a SR/SB. That is a paid hook up. \n\nAssuming X is the standard for what we know. How man x's per week or per vist or per month. x,xxx? xx,xxx? Are you wanting xx,xxx per month? or what? Why does the SD hve to play 20 questions? Just give him your amount you are happy with?\n\nWaiting around for your magic number is probably not going to happen right away. Since you are coming here posting about it. I know it has not.",
