My wife said I was crazy and I looked the same as I did when I was 21 but I hopped on Fin anyways now I\u2019m in my mid 30s and haven\u2019t lost any hair at all. A lot of these younger guys are just really self conscious and for good reason when TikTok and Instagram have these kids convinced that you should look like an IFBB pro before graduating high school, sarms have been the go to for a lot of them and unfortunately sarms are shit and much much worse than just a cycle or 2 IMO especially for hairlines. It\u2019s just narcissistic personalities trying to stick out, same kids will make videos in their late 20s about the dangers of steroids and sarms and how they don\u2019t know blah blah.",

Time they need for proper development and they don't have it. I mean sure if you look in the past people have experienced much worse things like world wars and slavery and there are so many unthinkable things that happened. But for our kind of spoiled western society of course there many people who also have no wealth and problems with living in the west. But also for a big majority this pandemic is the worst thing that happened in many years.\n\nTl;Dr people lose the hair because of stress especially in the current Covid times",
