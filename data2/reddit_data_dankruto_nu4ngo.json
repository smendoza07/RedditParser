Neji then compensated for how messed up he was and managed to start keeping away from him but knew he couldn't do it forever or win against a dude with what's basically a balista as a crippled Taijutsu specialist.\n\nKidomaru proceeded to spit up his massive railgun arrow, and use it to finish the fight. Neji intentionally takes the hit, streamed chakra through the connecting Web that led to Kidomaru, to kill him with a heart attack/mass organ failure.",

Neji then compensated for how messed up he was and managed to start keeping away from him but knew he couldn't do it forever or win against a dude with what's basically a balista as a crippled Taijutsu specialist.\n\nKidomaru proceeded to spit up his massive railgun arrow, and use it to finish the fight.
