You have to be as to use your brain and interpret whether that's false narration, the narrator simply has wrong information, or it's the truth. \n\nIn this case, seeing as how Nagato nearly 1v3 Itachi, Bee and Naruto, it isn't far fetched to believe that. Would you say the same thing if someone said \"Itachi was said to be stronger than Konohamaru\"? \n\nOr course not, cause you're smart enough to know nothing really goes against that statement, and some feats even support it.
