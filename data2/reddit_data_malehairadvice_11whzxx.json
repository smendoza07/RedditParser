It\u2019s possibly achievable. \n\nBut it would be hell to maintain, you would need to grow your hair out for like 2 years, go to a legit salon to get layers cut into it (show them the reference pic) and highlights, probably $200 w haircut highlights and style, and every morning shower, sea salt, blow dry, product and style, hairspray for hold, 20 min minimum daily and your style will probably fall out halfway through the day bc this is for a pro photo shoot.\n\nBut if you want to explore this, start with growing your hair out, when it gets to several inches long start experimenting w sea salt spray and hair drying, and you might be pleasantly surprised at the cool shit your hair wants to do on its own.",

It\u2019s possibly achievable. \n\nBut it would be hell to maintain, you would need to grow your hair out for like 2 years, go to a legit salon to get layers cut into it (show them the reference pic) and highlights, probably $200 w haircut highlights and style, and every morning shower, sea salt, blow dry, product and style, hairspray for hold, 20 min minimum daily and your style will probably fall out halfway through the day bc this is for a pro photo shoot.\n\nBut if you want to explore this, start with growing your hair out, when it gets to several inches long start experimenting w sea salt spray and hair drying, and you might be pleasantly surprised at the cool shit your hair wants to do on its own.",

Indian dudes can have some fantastic wavy long hair, and it\u2019s weird that people are saying this guy has thick hair bc it actually looks like pretty thin strands that he just put a ton of sea salt spray and product in. It\u2019s possibly achievable. \n\nBut it would be hell to maintain, you would need to grow your hair out for like 2 years, go to a legit salon to get layers cut into it (show them the reference pic) and highlights, probably $200 w haircut highlights and style, and every morning shower, sea salt, blow dry, product and style, hairspray for hold, 20 min minimum daily and your style will probably fall out halfway through the day bc this is for a pro photo shoot.\n\nBut if you want to explore this, start with growing your hair out, when it gets to several inches long start experimenting w sea salt spray and hair drying, and you might be pleasantly surprised at the cool shit your hair wants to do on its own.",
