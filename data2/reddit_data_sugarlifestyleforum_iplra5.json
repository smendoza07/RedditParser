    "body": "My sugar daddy and I used the past few months of this quarantine summer together to get closer. We have been in a sugar relationship for over 9 months now. \n\nI took a business communication class and began to use the principles of communicating with him and others to express my messages concisely, something I struggled with. I think after this our relationship changed for the better. \n\nIn May, we started to really open up more to each other about our dirty laundry.  I learned about his late twin sister, him dealing with his challenges, and a lot more.  Maybe being stuck in a house together for a few weeks did this for us? It gave me a different perspective of him that I am grateful to see. \n\nBefore, I was not too keen on going out in public with him because I was worried about the looks of others. Us getting closer helped me get over this feeling because I am happy to be around him and have his company. \n\nMy University is remote for the rest of the school year and he invited me to stay with him for a bit as his girlfriend to give me a place to do my schoolwork. Now I have to deal with him randomly singing Rihanna during my Zoom classes.",
