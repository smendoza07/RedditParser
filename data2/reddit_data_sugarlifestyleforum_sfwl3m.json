    "body": "I\u2019ve been a long term sugar baby. And I wish I knew then what I know now. I have put together some advice and I hope this helps some of you navigate this way of life without making the mistakes I made along the way\u2026long post, sorry in advance. \n1) this is not a bf/gf thing. When you and your Sd are together, you\u2019re together. At that time you put your phone away and give your undivided attention! Do not discuss parts of your life that don\u2019t concern him. Don\u2019t discuss any other relationship in your life. It will only be an issue later. \n-also, if he is married, that\u2019s not a bad thing. It permits you to still have freedom to do things without him demanding every waking moment you have to him. But also consider that if he is married that it limits things like how much he can spend on you without having to explain anything to his spouse. But at the same time, karma is a bitch. Knowingly sleeping with someone else\u2019s husband even for money has consequences. Be aware of them and ready for what comes with it\u2026\n2) cars: if he is going to provide you a car, PAY ATTENTION TO THE PAPERWORK. did he BUY you a car or did he lease it? If he gets you a car make sure he puts YOUR NAME on it. Better if he buys it outright because if he makes payments and something goes wrong how will you continue to pay for it? And also, be careful because if he gets mad he will take that car back if it\u2019s not in your name. Bad situation. You end up back where you started. Same if he lets you drive one of his. That\u2019s a bandaid and a pacifier not a solution.\n3) housing- if he wants to take care of you, great! Find a nice place for yourself. He can pay the rent mortgage etc. but DO NOT MOVE INTO HIS HOUSE WITH HIM! That is not taking care of you. He is going to pay those bills regardless! And it\u2019s his attempt at having his cake and eating it too. It also blurs the lines of your situation. And when all is said and done you still don\u2019t have anything. You go back to zero when arrangements over. \n-also consider that moving in with him you lose privacy. You lose your independence and he will be up your ass more than you are prepared for. And his sense of control and entitlement will grow too. Also living under same roof will mean your responsibility and obligations will grow. If he wants sex everyday, you kinda don\u2019t have a choice. \n4) allowance-DONT PISS AWAY MONEY OR BUY STUPID USELESS STUFF. STACK THAT SHIT! So you are in a better position even when the arrangement ends. \n5)other men and regular relationships:\nHonestly? Bad idea. You will find yourself hating the man that pays all your bills yet loving and answering to a boyfriend that won\u2019t? Makes no sense. If you are in a relationship you should not need a sugar daddy. Make better choices. \n6) do not lose site of your role in his life. Don\u2019t overplay your position. Don\u2019t depend solely on him for everything because the second you don\u2019t do something he expects now, he can snatch the rug out from under you. Don\u2019t introduce him to a vibe you can\u2019t maintain!\n7) ask yourself, am I dealing with this because I want to live well for the time being? Make wise decisions with the blessings, so that you are in a better position even after the arrangement ends. That\u2019s the point! \n8) stay out of your feelings. There\u2019s no money in there! Emotion is the sworn enemy of logic!\n9) don\u2019t get lazy or too comfortable! Keep working on bettering yourself. According to you! Not him\u2026things change. And sometimes for no reason. Be prepared for that!\n10) be honest, don\u2019t be greedy but don\u2019t sell yourself short either. Don\u2019t give more info than needed. Don\u2019t discuss your past. It will only give a person ammo to judge or throw at you later. Focus on present and future. \n\nI hope this helps someone. All the things I spoke on I know from first hand experience and I learned the hard way. I had to figure it out trial and error. So I dropped these jewels to prevent you from doing the same. You may or may not agree. I\u2019m speaking from my own experience and with more than one Sd. No judgement needed. Ladies feel free to add anything I may have forgotten \nXoxo\nSupreme being.",

It's good to not treat it like a bf/gf but also don't treat it like a one night stand.  You're in a relationship, just learn to compartmentalize and be a mature person when it ends.  \n\n2) She may not be in a position to \"stack that shit\".

Because if it is, the SD can stop making payments, and then the bank can repossess the car. In other words, make sure the title is 100% clean, and only in the SB's name.\n\nAlso make sure the SD doesn't cancel the insurance without your knowledge (which can happen in a bad break-up). It's best to make sure that the entire year's insurance premium is paid by the SD up front.",

If I bought a decent car or a boob job and the girl left,  I would extremely unhappy.,\n\nOne of my prior SB\u2019s had a SD that financed a Tahoe through his company.  They split and it took 4 months to get her credit fixed and to refinance the expensive SUV on her salary.  It was 4 months of contact she really didn\u2019t want and sending him money for the payment and insurance.   He was a little salty but he wasn\u2019t nasty about it. Could have been much worse.",

So in general less desperate girls turning to sugar as a last resort to survive.\n\nAnother big difference is that prostitution is legal (or at least tolerated) in most European countries, so less abuse of the sugar bowl by Johns and escorts to get in contact with each other.\n\nLast but not least, people are more prone to travel with and to each other, international travel isn't such an issue.",
