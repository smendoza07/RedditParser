    "body": "I understand in the sugar bowl there is give and take. I also understand when something is given what the sexual expectation. But i just had a daddy do a 180 on me last night.\n\nWe started the day drinking. I suggested i invite my friend to hang with us and hopefully it would turn into some fun. Before she got there I tried to get kinky with my daddy just in case she wouldn\u2019t be down. He denied almost certain she\u2019d put out later.\n\nAs the night went on, we drank and had fun. But at one point during the night my friend hinted she was tired and wanted to go home. I kind of wanted to go home too. Since i was drunk she said she\u2019d take my car to her house and i could sleep over.\n\nThe SD flipped out saying he\u2019d get her an Uber. But i also was no longer in the mood- that ship had sailed. \n\nMy car was at his house so we needed a ride to get it, but he just stormed out of the bar. And left.\n\nMy friend at this point was uncomfortable got her own Uber home.\n\nWhen i got to his house i told him that since she got a ride i wanted to just crash on his couch because i didn\u2019t feel safe driving. \n \nAt first he agreed then 10 mins later woke me up demanding i sleep in his bed. I said no. He then said he\u2019s calling another girl over and i had to leave.\n\nI was still fairly drunk and said I\u2019d prefer if i could just sleep for an hour. He can do whatever he wants. He then threatened to call the cops if i don\u2019t leave.\n\nObviously i wasn\u2019t going to play any games, so i got up and went to my car. He then confessed he never had or intended on calling the police.\n\nThankfully i made it home safe, i just need to vent.",

Not drinking as much will help you keep your wits about you more. I really encourage SBs to not get intoxicated around SDs they do not know well. Not saying that the SD is a douche canoe, just being drunk can lower your wits.",

If the relationship was already rocky, why invite a friend and get intoxicated with someone who had already shown signs of being an asshole? \n\nOf course I don't blame OP for the actions of the SD. Unfortunately, the world operates in a way where you really need to be more careful. Getting hammered around someone who can abuse you one way or another (specially when he's shown signs of not being a respectable person), and inviting a friend over to interact with this risky person don't really seem like very good choices. \n\n I'm very glad you were able to get out of the situation and returned home safely, and I wish there was something that could be done to prevent other women to be at risk with him. Just try to be more careful next time.",

Not to mention history of getting way too inebriated on alcohol when going out and resulting in at least a DUI (eta multiple arrests and drug abuse). \n\n\n/u/justunjust this is a wakeup call if there ever was one. Yes the bowl and life is harsh but I think you've been rolling with the punches and hoping for the best for way too long. You need to take a break from the bowl before you land yourself in an even worse situation, which I  honestly think is inevitable if you don't change your approach and start learning from your mistakes. \n\n\nAnd for the love of God please start taking ubers OR not drink *at all* when you bring your car with you. Rehab and doing community service doesn't mean much when you're still going out and getting drunk and sugaring haphazardly. You really can turn your life around but you need to look inward. ",

Unfortunately, the world operates in a way where you really need to be more careful. Getting hammered around someone who can abuse you one way or another (specially when he's shown signs of not being a respectable person), and inviting a friend over to interact with this risky person don't really seem like very good choices. \n\n I'm very glad you were able to get out of the situation and returned home safely, and I wish there was something that could be done to prevent other women to be at risk with him.

Getting hammered around someone who can abuse you one way or another (specially when he's shown signs of not being a respectable person), and inviting a friend over to interact with this risky person don't really seem like very good choices. \n\n I'm very glad you were able to get out of the situation and returned home safely, and I wish there was something that could be done to prevent other women to be at risk with him.

Getting hammered around someone who can abuse you one way or another (specially when he's shown signs of not being a respectable person), and inviting a friend over to interact with this risky person don't really seem like very good choices. \n\n I'm very glad you were able to get out of the situation and returned home safely, and I wish there was something that could be done to prevent other women to be at risk with him.

If the relationship was already rocky, why invite a friend and get intoxicated with someone who had already shown signs of being an asshole? \n\nOf course I don't blame OP for the actions of the SD. Unfortunately, the world operates in a way where you really need to be more careful. Getting hammered around someone who can abuse you one way or another (specially when he's shown signs of not being a respectable person), and inviting a friend over to interact with this risky person don't really seem like very good choices. \n\n I'm very glad you were able to get out of the situation and returned home safely, and I wish there was something that could be done to prevent other women to be at risk with him. Just try to be more careful next time.",
