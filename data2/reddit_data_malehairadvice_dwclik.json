It stops male pattern hair loss in most cases, almost universally from what I know. It's also not super expensive, but it has to be taken daily. \n\nOnce hair loss stops, if it really still bothers you and no haircut makes you comfortable, self-hair transplant is a possibility. \n\nBest of luck.",

But you should always consult with professionals.\n\nAs for treatment to increase the rate of recovery from stress related hair loss, I don't know any.",

It stops male pattern hair loss in most cases, almost universally from what I know. It's also not super expensive, but it has to be taken daily. \n\nOnce hair loss stops, if it really still bothers you and no haircut makes you comfortable, self-hair transplant is a possibility. \n\nBest of luck.",
