Obito used kamui to make his soul travel from the land of dead (where he met rin again) back to our world where he interacted with kakashis soul and lended him his power.

He simply put his soul inside kakashis body using kamui.",

He'd have the Sharingan and his Kamui, I would assume, start to actually make him go blind.  He'd have his weaker Susanoo but again, blindness.\n\nAnd nah, Tsunade was a LOT stronger than Kakashi was when he was Hokage.  A lot of people try to compare War Arc Kakashi to Tsunade, and in that case he's a lot stronger, but he got a HUGE nerf after losing his Sharingan.  Hiruzen is also no joke either.  He was basically Hashirama Lite.  No wood style, but he mastered basically every Jutsu in existence.  So many people sleep on him.",

I'm confident that dms obito or kakashi could solo fused momoshiki or isshiki with little to no difficulty. Dms kamui is too OP and taking away obitos bonus amps just make it OP for shorter time.\n\n\n\nAnd no lmao tsunade is absolutely not stronger than kakashi. While losing the sharingan was a nerf just to kakashis reaction speed and kamui, his stamina massively increased and he developed new techniques. Not to mention that as i said he either remained or gained more speed. Not to mention he still knows over 1000 jutsus. Kakashi was already a huge threat before but now he has MASSIVELY more stamina, more knowledge+experience, new techniques etc\n\n\n\nAnd Hiruzen is actually a big joke. He has exactly 0 impressive feats and the only thing going for him are empty vague statements. He doesn't know every jutsu in existence he was stated to know all konoha jutsu. Now the only jutsu canonically stated as \"konoha jutsu\" is 1000 years of pain. He didn't use any clan jutsu and doesn't have kekkei genkai so the most we can wank him to is that he knows a lot of elemental techniques. Now kakashi knows over a 1000 techniques so we can actually say he knows more AND has a LOT more stamina. In a battle between the kakashi and Hiruzen or tsunade kakashi would just blitz and decapitate them.",

Sasukes sharingan doesn't boost his physical speed meaning he's faster than him even in base.

Minato saw Guy is going to fight madara and had plenty of time to make up a strategy. And all he came up in such a long time was that Lee throws a kunai and Minato teleports away few TSO. Meanwhile tobirama could create a clone, teleport to Minato, grab the tso and teleport to obito before Minato could think of anything. Even later it's Tobirama who points out that Minatos arm didn't heal back and figured out that TSO nullify all ninjutsu and how they work.\n\n\n\"Also Minato teleporting those triple-H bomb Jubi-damas to the middle of the ocean puts him an edge over Tobirama\u2019s teleportation of the TSO\"\nNope lol. Whenever Minato teleported a tbb away he had plenty of time to get ready and later Naruto even outsmarted Minato when they saved the alliance using ftg (something only Naruto came up with despite Minato also having 9 tails and ftg)",

There\u2019s shit like Sasuke\u2019s being constantly out of chakra at the most inconvenient times/generally being nerfed, but you could argue that the writers had to do that after the corner they wrote themselves into with Naruto and Sasuke\u2019s power at the end of Shippuden. \n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen it said elsewhere, but the Boruto manga is pretty lit (especially rn). In a way it\u2019s like seeing what Naruto could\u2019ve been like if he didn\u2019t have the nine-tails, grew up with a stable home life and an OP dad. Boruto acts kinda whiney and spoiled towards the beginning but that\u2019s also a part of his character development. Because he never lived in the world that Naruto and then grew up with and only knew peace, he takes a lot of stuff for granted. It\u2019s not until shit starts to hit the fan that he wisens up and comes into his own as a shinobi.\n\nBoruto also tackles the idea of what times of peace can do for technological development, and similarly, what that does to the society that develops around that technology. It\u2019s interesting to see the clash of ideologies between those who think a shinobi\u2019s power should be their own and no one else\u2019s vs those who feel like technology is meant to enhance lives and give even more strength to make up for the short-comings of the individual. \n\nAlso, the manga has random jumps in time that seem to be intended to build in spots for the anime to put some filler material, which as we\u2019ve found recently actually does tie into the manga. I won\u2019t say too much but like characters that didn\u2019t mean much in the manga are built up more in the anime, and events that happen off-panel in the manga are animated in the show. Some people dislike this because of what it does for the pacing of the manga, but personally, I think it\u2019s a good thing because it\u2019s intended to help the series avoid situations like the end of OG Naruto where the entirety of the last two seasons were made up of pointless filler just to give the manga time to get ahead, as well as negate the need for pointless filler episodes sprinkled throughout. The fact that the writers know that the show represents a large portion of the series\u2019 viewership means that they\u2019ve tried to give some consequence to the filler episodes and have them actually tie in to the plot rather than just being forgotten about and ignored after the episode is over. \n\nExcept fuck the Cho-cho episodes. All my homies hate the Cho-cho episodes",

None of the big hax, none of the big chakra, none of the big OP jutsu like Flying Raijin, Byakuyo seal etc. An intellect and a powerful throwable chidori.\n\nMaybe that's Jonin+, maybe low-kage level.

If you believe any of that then sure but feats prove than she's not on their level and she's not any faster than Kakashi.\n\nKakashi is a genius in battle and if you think Sakura punching the floor can stop him from using Kamui then idk what to tell you. Kakashi used his Kamui on Pains infrared homing missiles and tracked a small nail that pain threw. He can snipe her head off. He just never does it in the actual story because they don't want to ruin tension by killing a villain in a second.\n\nCan she even tank a lighting clone? What would do if Kakashi comes at her with Raikiri? Kakashi's foot speed is also not talked about enough. He blitzed Sasuke and stopped him from stabbing Sakura, pretty sure he can evade her attacks and cut of one of her limbs making her lose constant blood. War arc Kakashi and Gai were tank bijuu hits so he might be able to tank one or two but she can't tank any serious jutsu he throws at her.",

Anything that doesn't kill her instantly is essentially useless, her healing power speaks for itself.\n\nAnd in her novel Sakura tanked a psuedo jinjuriki biju bomb. Its safe to say none of Kakashi's lightning or water style is going to be effective. \n\nSo kamui is his only weapon and I did say its not clear how fast that is exactly.

So Kakashi is really going to have to be careful with his timing to make sure he doesn't waste all that chakra that a kamui snipe would require.\n\n He'd have to wait for the perfect moment and I doubt he'd be able to keep up with her at all. He'd probably have to just wait til she ran out of chakra, which could be hours, but then he'd have to make sure he still has enough chakra left for a kamui snipe.\n\nI don't see how you think he could win even if he were faster, nothing gets past that healing, with substitution as insurance.",

And I'm pretty sure KCM1 Naruto is faster than Kakashi.\n\nTsunade speed =/= Sakura speed.  Just cause she kept up with Raikage doesn't mean Sakura could. Kakashi actually briefly threw hands with Sasuke who fight with Raikage.\n\n>And yes Sakura can straight up tank anything other than kamui. Tsunade tanked susano, yasaka beads, and phoenix flower. Anything that doesn't kill her instantly is essentially useless, her healing power speaks for itself.\n\nShe barely tanked it (Sakura) and she didn't lose any limbs when it happened. Kakashi can take her heart out with Raikiri and she wouldn't be able to react. We all know Kakashi is smart enough to set it up for a direct hit as well so even if he doesn't get her heart, she can't regain a lost limb if he were to cut any arm/leg.\n\nAnd Tsunade is not Sakura. Once Sakura actually tanks all of those there's no way to know she can tank it. \n\n>So kamui is his only weapon and I did say its not clear how fast that is exactly. So I can't just say she'd straight up dodge it. My guess though is that its slow because like you said he would've been sniping everyone's head off. \n\nI said it's because Kamui would ends fights too fast and it would kill the story. It should be instantaneous  or close to that cause Kakashi used Kamui on Narutos rasengan right infront of Obito but he didn't even see it. \n\n\n>And you can't just dismiss the cherry blossom clash. She's able to essentially nuke the battlefield and even if Kakashi comes out of that unharmed, it still serves as a smoke screen and since Kakashi doesn't have sensory abilities those few seconds of smoke and boulders flying everywhere are more than enough for Sakura to charge him\n\nSharingan can see the whole Chakra flow and even tiny bits of Chakra in the air like what Sasuke saw vs Deidara. She can't hide from him at all in this fight.\n\n>And you may not realize, even if he could just blitz snipe her, there's this little thing called substitution jutsu\n\nThat jutsu is confusing but I'm pretty sure the user has to get hit by the attack first. Substitution can't work on Kamui if that's actually how it works. Tbh I'm not sure tho.\n\n>He'd have to wait for the perfect moment and I doubt he'd be able to keep up with her at all. He'd probably have to just wait til she ran out of chakra, which could be hours, but then he'd have to make sure he still has enough chakra left for a kamui snipe.\n\nChakra doesn't mean anything if she loses a limb. She can out last him but he can definitely immobilize her and take the win.\n\n>I don't see how you think he could win even if he were faster, nothing gets past that healing, with substitution as insurance.\n\nSubtitution Justu won't do anything for her because kakashi's main two moves are are fatal jutsus and she has to avoid them. I honestly don't see a way she can win this fight.\n\nAnd she's not stronger than Tsunade unless in her novels they gave her some BS made up strength. She's strong and in the same tier as kakahshi and Tsunade but she's just a bit weaker.",

I've never seen anyone question that before, even the normal people who hate on Sakura accept that she surpassed Tsunade, maybe not in healing but certainly so in taijutsu. There's no reason for you to believe that Sakura isn't stronger and faster than her. The fact that Sakura tanked a psuedo jinjuriki biju bomb, without her healing even activated, only confirms that she has that same toughness as Tsunade. \n\nSakura is just a beast, a taijutsu master with literally overpowered healing abilities that make her an unkillable tank. \n\nAnd, again, you can't dismiss the cherry blossom clash. I know for a fact that sharingan cannot see through smoke screens, only byakugan can do that. I know because in Sasuke's fight against Killer Bee, he specifically asked Karin to sense Bee out after he tried to attack Karin, Suigetu and Jugo with a chakra cloak lariet, and his attack,  like the cherry blossom clash, threw a screen of dust in the air. Its clear that Sasuke could not see through that smoke. And Killer Bee knowing this tried to charge Sasuke from the smoke with a lariet, which is essentially what Sakura would do to Kakashi. And she can pretty much spam this ability. \n\nI think you really need to just rethink your evaluation of Sakura.",

He even says \"He's too fast but since he moves in a linear fashion, I can make out his movements\" and then asks Karin to tell him where he is all times. [Sasuke telling deidara he saw his bombs underground because he sees the chakra.](http://imgur.com/a/ua2Yuof). If he can see underground then he can see through a cloud of smoke easily.\n\nShe can't heal from lost limbs and Kakashi can speed blitz her with raikiri. There's no way she beats him and Kamui can definitely kill her and we know Kakashi can use Kamui on fast things since he used it on Pains missiles.\n\nI think your overrating Sakura and you need to rethink yours. You keep acting like Sakuras strong but there's no proof of her ever reaching tsunades level. Kakashi was actually fighting and getting hit by real bijuu's instead of fake bijuus in a filler novel.",

Kakashi was the only one not fighting Obito directly, I'm pretty sure it was because he knew he wasn't as fast as Naruto and Guy.\n\nJust watching that fight and how Kakashi used kamui, I don't think he would be at all able to kamui snipe KCM1 Naruto, meaning he couldn't do it to Sakura either.",

We don't really know if that was his max speed. And even so, that doesn't really mean Naruto wouldn't be able to dodge a kamui if he were actively trying to. \n\nI don't think its clear to be able to tell either way if Sakura could dodge it. \n\nAnd still, there is substitution jutsu. It works against any attack. So he'll probably have to keep trying even if he can just snipe her, and each time she subs is an opportunity to counter attack. \n\nSo even if he does have the advantage I don't think you could just say he beats her hands down, she still has a valid approach to the battle.",

A lot of people try to compare War Arc Kakashi to Tsunade, and in that case he's a lot stronger, but he got a HUGE nerf after losing his Sharingan.  Hiruzen is also no joke either.  He was basically Hashirama Lite.  No wood style, but he mastered basically every Jutsu in existence.  So many people sleep on him.",

I'm confident that dms obito or kakashi could solo fused momoshiki or isshiki with little to no difficulty. Dms kamui is too OP and taking away obitos bonus amps just make it OP for shorter time.\n\n\n\nAnd no lmao tsunade is absolutely not stronger than kakashi. While losing the sharingan was a nerf just to kakashis reaction speed and kamui, his stamina massively increased and he developed new techniques. Not to mention that as i said he either remained or gained more speed. Not to mention he still knows over 1000 jutsus. Kakashi was already a huge threat before but now he has MASSIVELY more stamina, more knowledge+experience, new techniques etc\n\n\n\nAnd Hiruzen is actually a big joke. He has exactly 0 impressive feats and the only thing going for him are empty vague statements. He doesn't know every jutsu in existence he was stated to know all konoha jutsu. Now the only jutsu canonically stated as \"konoha jutsu\" is 1000 years of pain. He didn't use any clan jutsu and doesn't have kekkei genkai so the most we can wank him to is that he knows a lot of elemental techniques. Now kakashi knows over a 1000 techniques so we can actually say he knows more AND has a LOT more stamina. In a battle between the kakashi and Hiruzen or tsunade kakashi would just blitz and decapitate them.",

Minato saw Guy is going to fight madara and had plenty of time to make up a strategy. And all he came up in such a long time was that Lee throws a kunai and Minato teleports away few TSO. Meanwhile tobirama could create a clone, teleport to Minato, grab the tso and teleport to obito before Minato could think of anything. Even later it's Tobirama who points out that Minatos arm didn't heal back and figured out that TSO nullify all ninjutsu and how they work.\n\n\n\"Also Minato teleporting those triple-H bomb Jubi-damas to the middle of the ocean puts him an edge over Tobirama\u2019s teleportation of the TSO\"\nNope lol.

There\u2019s shit like Sasuke\u2019s being constantly out of chakra at the most inconvenient times/generally being nerfed, but you could argue that the writers had to do that after the corner they wrote themselves into with Naruto and Sasuke\u2019s power at the end of Shippuden. \n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen it said elsewhere, but the Boruto manga is pretty lit (especially rn). In a way it\u2019s like seeing what Naruto could\u2019ve been like if he didn\u2019t have the nine-tails, grew up with a stable home life and an OP dad. Boruto acts kinda whiney and spoiled towards the beginning but that\u2019s also a part of his character development. Because he never lived in the world that Naruto and then grew up with and only knew peace, he takes a lot of stuff for granted. It\u2019s not until shit starts to hit the fan that he wisens up and comes into his own as a shinobi.\n\nBoruto also tackles the idea of what times of peace can do for technological development, and similarly, what that does to the society that develops around that technology. It\u2019s interesting to see the clash of ideologies between those who think a shinobi\u2019s power should be their own and no one else\u2019s vs those who feel like technology is meant to enhance lives and give even more strength to make up for the short-comings of the individual. \n\nAlso, the manga has random jumps in time that seem to be intended to build in spots for the anime to put some filler material, which as we\u2019ve found recently actually does tie into the manga. I won\u2019t say too much but like characters that didn\u2019t mean much in the manga are built up more in the anime, and events that happen off-panel in the manga are animated in the show. Some people dislike this because of what it does for the pacing of the manga, but personally, I think it\u2019s a good thing because it\u2019s intended to help the series avoid situations like the end of OG Naruto where the entirety of the last two seasons were made up of pointless filler just to give the manga time to get ahead, as well as negate the need for pointless filler episodes sprinkled throughout. The fact that the writers know that the show represents a large portion of the series\u2019 viewership means that they\u2019ve tried to give some consequence to the filler episodes and have them actually tie in to the plot rather than just being forgotten about and ignored after the episode is over. \n\nExcept fuck the Cho-cho episodes. All my homies hate the Cho-cho episodes",

When you make a character god-level, you\u2019re gonna have a hard time power scaling going forward and making fights actually interesting, and this is an issue that most shonen anime have to deal with, it just goes with the territory",

None of the big hax, none of the big chakra, none of the big OP jutsu like Flying Raijin, Byakuyo seal etc. An intellect and a powerful throwable chidori.\n\nMaybe that's Jonin+, maybe low-kage level.

Kakashi used his Kamui on Pains infrared homing missiles and tracked a small nail that pain threw. He can snipe her head off. He just never does it in the actual story because they don't want to ruin tension by killing a villain in a second.\n\nCan she even tank a lighting clone?

He blitzed Sasuke and stopped him from stabbing Sakura, pretty sure he can evade her attacks and cut of one of her limbs making her lose constant blood.

Kakashi actually briefly threw hands with Sasuke who fight with Raikage.\n\n>And yes Sakura can straight up tank anything other than kamui. Tsunade tanked susano, yasaka beads, and phoenix flower. Anything that doesn't kill her instantly is essentially useless, her healing power speaks for itself.\n\nShe barely tanked it (Sakura) and she didn't lose any limbs when it happened. Kakashi can take her heart out with Raikiri and she wouldn't be able to react. We all know Kakashi is smart enough to set it up for a direct hit as well so even if he doesn't get her heart, she can't regain a lost limb if he were to cut any arm/leg.\n\nAnd Tsunade is not Sakura. Once Sakura actually tanks all of those there's no way to know she can tank it. \n\n>So kamui is his only weapon and I did say its not clear how fast that is exactly. So I can't just say she'd straight up dodge it. My guess though is that its slow because like you said he would've been sniping everyone's head off. \n\nI said it's because Kamui would ends fights too fast and it would kill the story. It should be instantaneous  or close to that cause Kakashi used Kamui on Narutos rasengan right infront of Obito but he didn't even see it. \n\n\n>And you can't just dismiss the cherry blossom clash. She's able to essentially nuke the battlefield and even if Kakashi comes out of that unharmed, it still serves as a smoke screen and since Kakashi doesn't have sensory abilities those few seconds of smoke and boulders flying everywhere are more than enough for Sakura to charge him\n\nSharingan can see the whole Chakra flow and even tiny bits of Chakra in the air like what Sasuke saw vs Deidara. She can't hide from him at all in this fight.\n\n>And you may not realize, even if he could just blitz snipe her, there's this little thing called substitution jutsu\n\nThat jutsu is confusing but I'm pretty sure the user has to get hit by the attack first. Substitution can't work on Kamui if that's actually how it works. Tbh I'm not sure tho.\n\n>He'd have to wait for the perfect moment and I doubt he'd be able to keep up with her at all. He'd probably have to just wait til she ran out of chakra, which could be hours, but then he'd have to make sure he still has enough chakra left for a kamui snipe.\n\nChakra doesn't mean anything if she loses a limb. She can out last him but he can definitely immobilize her and take the win.\n\n>I don't see how you think he could win even if he were faster, nothing gets past that healing, with substitution as insurance.\n\nSubtitution Justu won't do anything for her because kakashi's main two moves are are fatal jutsus and she has to avoid them. I honestly don't see a way she can win this fight.\n\nAnd she's not stronger than Tsunade unless in her novels they gave her some BS made up strength. She's strong and in the same tier as kakahshi and Tsunade but she's just a bit weaker.",

I've never seen anyone question that before, even the normal people who hate on Sakura accept that she surpassed Tsunade, maybe not in healing but certainly so in taijutsu. There's no reason for you to believe that Sakura isn't stronger and faster than her. The fact that Sakura tanked a psuedo jinjuriki biju bomb, without her healing even activated, only confirms that she has that same toughness as Tsunade. \n\nSakura is just a beast, a taijutsu master with literally overpowered healing abilities that make her an unkillable tank. \n\nAnd, again, you can't dismiss the cherry blossom clash. I know for a fact that sharingan cannot see through smoke screens, only byakugan can do that. I know because in Sasuke's fight against Killer Bee, he specifically asked Karin to sense Bee out after he tried to attack Karin, Suigetu and Jugo with a chakra cloak lariet, and his attack,  like the cherry blossom clash, threw a screen of dust in the air. Its clear that Sasuke could not see through that smoke. And Killer Bee knowing this tried to charge Sasuke from the smoke with a lariet, which is essentially what Sakura would do to Kakashi. And she can pretty much spam this ability. \n\nI think you really need to just rethink your evaluation of Sakura.",

When asked if Sakura surpassed Tsunade, Kishimoto replied 'yes, absolutely.' \n\nIf you think one eye Kakashi beats not only Lady Hokage, but also the buffed up version of her that is Sakura then I just don't know how to convince you. \n\nI just went back and watched the fight between Naruto with Kakashi and Guy vs Obito, just to get a feel of KCM1 Naruto, which is how fast Sakura is said to be, and Kakashi. Kakashi was the only one not fighting Obito directly, I'm pretty sure it was because he knew he wasn't as fast as Naruto and Guy.\n\nJust watching that fight and how Kakashi used kamui, I don't think he would be at all able to kamui snipe KCM1 Naruto, meaning he couldn't do it to Sakura either.",

It works against any attack. So he'll probably have to keep trying even if he can just snipe her, and each time she subs is an opportunity to counter attack. \n\nSo even if he does have the advantage I don't think you could just say he beats her hands down, she still has a valid approach to the battle.",

A lot of people try to compare War Arc Kakashi to Tsunade, and in that case he's a lot stronger, but he got a HUGE nerf after losing his Sharingan.  Hiruzen is also no joke either.

So maybe Kakashi could have that as a trump card but can only use for less than a minute, since he doesn't have Six Paths Chakra anymore. So kind of like the 8th Gate where he would die if he used the Susanoo.",

I'm confident that dms obito or kakashi could solo fused momoshiki or isshiki with little to no difficulty. Dms kamui is too OP and taking away obitos bonus amps just make it OP for shorter time.\n\n\n\nAnd no lmao tsunade is absolutely not stronger than kakashi. While losing the sharingan was a nerf just to kakashis reaction speed and kamui, his stamina massively increased and he developed new techniques. Not to mention that as i said he either remained or gained more speed. Not to mention he still knows over 1000 jutsus. Kakashi was already a huge threat before but now he has MASSIVELY more stamina, more knowledge+experience, new techniques etc\n\n\n\nAnd Hiruzen is actually a big joke. He has exactly 0 impressive feats and the only thing going for him are empty vague statements. He doesn't know every jutsu in existence he was stated to know all konoha jutsu. Now the only jutsu canonically stated as \"konoha jutsu\" is 1000 years of pain. He didn't use any clan jutsu and doesn't have kekkei genkai so the most we can wank him to is that he knows a lot of elemental techniques. Now kakashi knows over a 1000 techniques so we can actually say he knows more AND has a LOT more stamina. In a battle between the kakashi and Hiruzen or tsunade kakashi would just blitz and decapitate them.",

Minatos raw speed is equal to 4th raikage. Meaning he's slower than like 20+ different characters in the series. It's actually pretty simple. Edo Madara was as fast or faster than 4th raikage, alive madara is faster than edo madara and tobirama is faster than madara. Meaning tobirama >madara >ay= Minato\n\n\n\"I get what you mean, but Tobirama is scientist-type smart more than battle-smart, whereas Minato is one of the top 2 most battle-smart shinobi in the series. \"\n\nNo tobirama displayed better intelligence feats in war arc than Minato. Minato is maybe like top 5 smartest characters in the series. We've literally seen kcm2 Minato couldn't do anything when Obito planted a TSO on him while tobirama instantly reacted, sent a clone, grabbed the tso and teleported it away. Tobirama by far surpasses Minato in almost every way except teleportation speed.",

Minato saw Guy is going to fight madara and had plenty of time to make up a strategy. And all he came up in such a long time was that Lee throws a kunai and Minato teleports away few TSO. Meanwhile tobirama could create a clone, teleport to Minato, grab the tso and teleport to obito before Minato could think of anything. Even later it's Tobirama who points out that Minatos arm didn't heal back and figured out that TSO nullify all ninjutsu and how they work.\n\n\n\"Also Minato teleporting those triple-H bomb Jubi-damas to the middle of the ocean puts him an edge over Tobirama\u2019s teleportation of the TSO\"\nNope lol. Whenever Minato teleported a tbb away he had plenty of time to get ready and later Naruto even outsmarted Minato when they saved the alliance using ftg (something only Naruto came up with despite Minato also having 9 tails and ftg)",

There\u2019s shit like Sasuke\u2019s being constantly out of chakra at the most inconvenient times/generally being nerfed, but you could argue that the writers had to do that after the corner they wrote themselves into with Naruto and Sasuke\u2019s power at the end of Shippuden. \n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen it said elsewhere, but the Boruto manga is pretty lit (especially rn). In a way it\u2019s like seeing what Naruto could\u2019ve been like if he didn\u2019t have the nine-tails, grew up with a stable home life and an OP dad. Boruto acts kinda whiney and spoiled towards the beginning but that\u2019s also a part of his character development. Because he never lived in the world that Naruto and then grew up with and only knew peace, he takes a lot of stuff for granted. It\u2019s not until shit starts to hit the fan that he wisens up and comes into his own as a shinobi.\n\nBoruto also tackles the idea of what times of peace can do for technological development, and similarly, what that does to the society that develops around that technology. It\u2019s interesting to see the clash of ideologies between those who think a shinobi\u2019s power should be their own and no one else\u2019s vs those who feel like technology is meant to enhance lives and give even more strength to make up for the short-comings of the individual. \n\nAlso, the manga has random jumps in time that seem to be intended to build in spots for the anime to put some filler material, which as we\u2019ve found recently actually does tie into the manga. I won\u2019t say too much but like characters that didn\u2019t mean much in the manga are built up more in the anime, and events that happen off-panel in the manga are animated in the show. Some people dislike this because of what it does for the pacing of the manga, but personally, I think it\u2019s a good thing because it\u2019s intended to help the series avoid situations like the end of OG Naruto where the entirety of the last two seasons were made up of pointless filler just to give the manga time to get ahead, as well as negate the need for pointless filler episodes sprinkled throughout. The fact that the writers know that the show represents a large portion of the series\u2019 viewership means that they\u2019ve tried to give some consequence to the filler episodes and have them actually tie in to the plot rather than just being forgotten about and ignored after the episode is over. \n\nExcept fuck the Cho-cho episodes. All my homies hate the Cho-cho episodes",

None of the big hax, none of the big chakra, none of the big OP jutsu like Flying Raijin, Byakuyo seal etc. An intellect and a powerful throwable chidori.\n\nMaybe that's Jonin+, maybe low-kage level.

Kakashi used his Kamui on Pains infrared homing missiles and tracked a small nail that pain threw. He can snipe her head off. He just never does it in the actual story because they don't want to ruin tension by killing a villain in a second.\n\nCan she even tank a lighting clone? What would do if Kakashi comes at her with Raikiri? Kakashi's foot speed is also not talked about enough. He blitzed Sasuke and stopped him from stabbing Sakura, pretty sure he can evade her attacks and cut of one of her limbs making her lose constant blood.

Tsunade was almost as fast as the Raikage, who also fought KCM1 Naruto so it makes sense to say that Sakura would be around as fast as those characters. And I'm pretty sure KCM1 Naruto is faster than Kakashi. \n\nAnd yes Sakura can straight up tank anything other than kamui. Tsunade tanked susano, yasaka beads, and phoenix flower. Anything that doesn't kill her instantly is essentially useless, her healing power speaks for itself.\n\nAnd in her novel Sakura tanked a psuedo jinjuriki biju bomb. Its safe to say none of Kakashi's lightning or water style is going to be effective. \n\nSo kamui is his only weapon and I did say its not clear how fast that is exactly. So I can't just say she'd straight up dodge it. My guess though is that its slow because like you said he would've been sniping everyone's head off. \n\nAnd you can't just dismiss the cherry blossom clash. She's able to essentially nuke the battlefield and even if Kakashi comes out of that unharmed, it still serves as a smoke screen and since Kakashi doesn't have sensory abilities those few seconds of smoke and boulders flying everywhere are more than enough for Sakura to charge him, or at least to prevent him from using kamui which requires line of sight.\n\nAnd you may not realize, even if he could just blitz snipe her, there's this little thing called substitution jutsu, that Sakura in particular is known for using consecutively. So Kakashi is really going to have to be careful with his timing to make sure he doesn't waste all that chakra that a kamui snipe would require.\n\n He'd have to wait for the perfect moment and I doubt he'd be able to keep up with her at all. He'd probably have to just wait til she ran out of chakra, which could be hours, but then he'd have to make sure he still has enough chakra left for a kamui snipe.\n\nI don't see how you think he could win even if he were faster, nothing gets past that healing, with substitution as insurance.",

Kakashi actually briefly threw hands with Sasuke who fight with Raikage.\n\n>And yes Sakura can straight up tank anything other than kamui. Tsunade tanked susano, yasaka beads, and phoenix flower. Anything that doesn't kill her instantly is essentially useless, her healing power speaks for itself.\n\nShe barely tanked it (Sakura) and she didn't lose any limbs when it happened. Kakashi can take her heart out with Raikiri and she wouldn't be able to react. We all know Kakashi is smart enough to set it up for a direct hit as well so even if he doesn't get her heart, she can't regain a lost limb if he were to cut any arm/leg.\n\nAnd Tsunade is not Sakura. Once Sakura actually tanks all of those there's no way to know she can tank it. \n\n>So kamui is his only weapon and I did say its not clear how fast that is exactly. So I can't just say she'd straight up dodge it. My guess though is that its slow because like you said he would've been sniping everyone's head off. \n\nI said it's because Kamui would ends fights too fast and it would kill the story. It should be instantaneous  or close to that cause Kakashi used Kamui on Narutos rasengan right infront of Obito but he didn't even see it. \n\n\n>And you can't just dismiss the cherry blossom clash. She's able to essentially nuke the battlefield and even if Kakashi comes out of that unharmed, it still serves as a smoke screen and since Kakashi doesn't have sensory abilities those few seconds of smoke and boulders flying everywhere are more than enough for Sakura to charge him\n\nSharingan can see the whole Chakra flow and even tiny bits of Chakra in the air like what Sasuke saw vs Deidara. She can't hide from him at all in this fight.\n\n>And you may not realize, even if he could just blitz snipe her, there's this little thing called substitution jutsu\n\nThat jutsu is confusing but I'm pretty sure the user has to get hit by the attack first. Substitution can't work on Kamui if that's actually how it works. Tbh I'm not sure tho.\n\n>He'd have to wait for the perfect moment and I doubt he'd be able to keep up with her at all. He'd probably have to just wait til she ran out of chakra, which could be hours, but then he'd have to make sure he still has enough chakra left for a kamui snipe.\n\nChakra doesn't mean anything if she loses a limb. She can out last him but he can definitely immobilize her and take the win.\n\n>I don't see how you think he could win even if he were faster, nothing gets past that healing, with substitution as insurance.\n\nSubtitution Justu won't do anything for her because kakashi's main two moves are are fatal jutsus and she has to avoid them. I honestly don't see a way she can win this fight.\n\nAnd she's not stronger than Tsunade unless in her novels they gave her some BS made up strength. She's strong and in the same tier as kakahshi and Tsunade but she's just a bit weaker.",

I've never seen anyone question that before, even the normal people who hate on Sakura accept that she surpassed Tsunade, maybe not in healing but certainly so in taijutsu. There's no reason for you to believe that Sakura isn't stronger and faster than her. The fact that Sakura tanked a psuedo jinjuriki biju bomb, without her healing even activated, only confirms that she has that same toughness as Tsunade. \n\nSakura is just a beast, a taijutsu master with literally overpowered healing abilities that make her an unkillable tank. \n\nAnd, again, you can't dismiss the cherry blossom clash. I know for a fact that sharingan cannot see through smoke screens, only byakugan can do that. I know because in Sasuke's fight against Killer Bee, he specifically asked Karin to sense Bee out after he tried to attack Karin, Suigetu and Jugo with a chakra cloak lariet, and his attack,  like the cherry blossom clash, threw a screen of dust in the air. Its clear that Sasuke could not see through that smoke. And Killer Bee knowing this tried to charge Sasuke from the smoke with a lariet, which is essentially what Sakura would do to Kakashi. And she can pretty much spam this ability. \n\nI think you really need to just rethink your evaluation of Sakura.",

Sakura can't survive a real Bijuu bomb and those novels aren't even canon so there's no reason to bring those up. Sakura is not stronger than Tsunade. Hashirama saying she's stronger doesn't mean anything because all he literally saw her do was punch the ground and nothing else for the whole war and he's never seen Tsunade since she was a kid.\n\nSasuke asked Karin to sense killer Bee because he was moving way too fast to even locate. He even says \"He's too fast but since he moves in a linear fashion, I can make out his movements\" and then asks Karin to tell him where he is all times. [Sasuke telling deidara he saw his bombs underground because he sees the chakra.](http://imgur.com/a/ua2Yuof). If he can see underground then he can see through a cloud of smoke easily.\n\nShe can't heal from lost limbs and Kakashi can speed blitz her with raikiri. There's no way she beats him and Kamui can definitely kill her and we know Kakashi can use Kamui on fast things since he used it on Pains missiles.\n\nI think your overrating Sakura and you need to rethink yours. You keep acting like Sakuras strong but there's no proof of her ever reaching tsunades level. Kakashi was actually fighting and getting hit by real bijuu's instead of fake bijuus in a filler novel.",

A lot of people try to compare War Arc Kakashi to Tsunade, and in that case he's a lot stronger, but he got a HUGE nerf after losing his Sharingan.  Hiruzen is also no joke either.

I'm confident that dms obito or kakashi could solo fused momoshiki or isshiki with little to no difficulty. Dms kamui is too OP and taking away obitos bonus amps just make it OP for shorter time.\n\n\n\nAnd no lmao tsunade is absolutely not stronger than kakashi. While losing the sharingan was a nerf just to kakashis reaction speed and kamui, his stamina massively increased and he developed new techniques. Not to mention that as i said he either remained or gained more speed. Not to mention he still knows over 1000 jutsus. Kakashi was already a huge threat before but now he has MASSIVELY more stamina, more knowledge+experience, new techniques etc\n\n\n\nAnd Hiruzen is actually a big joke. He has exactly 0 impressive feats and the only thing going for him are empty vague statements. He doesn't know every jutsu in existence he was stated to know all konoha jutsu. Now the only jutsu canonically stated as \"konoha jutsu\" is 1000 years of pain. He didn't use any clan jutsu and doesn't have kekkei genkai so the most we can wank him to is that he knows a lot of elemental techniques. Now kakashi knows over a 1000 techniques so we can actually say he knows more AND has a LOT more stamina. In a battle between the kakashi and Hiruzen or tsunade kakashi would just blitz and decapitate them.",

Minato saw Guy is going to fight madara and had plenty of time to make up a strategy. And all he came up in such a long time was that Lee throws a kunai and Minato teleports away few TSO. Meanwhile tobirama could create a clone, teleport to Minato, grab the tso and teleport to obito before Minato could think of anything. Even later it's Tobirama who points out that Minatos arm didn't heal back and figured out that TSO nullify all ninjutsu and how they work.\n\n\n\"Also Minato teleporting those triple-H bomb Jubi-damas to the middle of the ocean puts him an edge over Tobirama\u2019s teleportation of the TSO\"\nNope lol. Whenever Minato teleported a tbb away he had plenty of time to get ready and later Naruto even outsmarted Minato when they saved the alliance using ftg (something only Naruto came up with despite Minato also having 9 tails and ftg)",

There\u2019s shit like Sasuke\u2019s being constantly out of chakra at the most inconvenient times/generally being nerfed, but you could argue that the writers had to do that after the corner they wrote themselves into with Naruto and Sasuke\u2019s power at the end of Shippuden. \n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen it said elsewhere, but the Boruto manga is pretty lit (especially rn). In a way it\u2019s like seeing what Naruto could\u2019ve been like if he didn\u2019t have the nine-tails, grew up with a stable home life and an OP dad. Boruto acts kinda whiney and spoiled towards the beginning but that\u2019s also a part of his character development. Because he never lived in the world that Naruto and then grew up with and only knew peace, he takes a lot of stuff for granted. It\u2019s not until shit starts to hit the fan that he wisens up and comes into his own as a shinobi.\n\nBoruto also tackles the idea of what times of peace can do for technological development, and similarly, what that does to the society that develops around that technology. It\u2019s interesting to see the clash of ideologies between those who think a shinobi\u2019s power should be their own and no one else\u2019s vs those who feel like technology is meant to enhance lives and give even more strength to make up for the short-comings of the individual. \n\nAlso, the manga has random jumps in time that seem to be intended to build in spots for the anime to put some filler material, which as we\u2019ve found recently actually does tie into the manga. I won\u2019t say too much but like characters that didn\u2019t mean much in the manga are built up more in the anime, and events that happen off-panel in the manga are animated in the show. Some people dislike this because of what it does for the pacing of the manga, but personally, I think it\u2019s a good thing because it\u2019s intended to help the series avoid situations like the end of OG Naruto where the entirety of the last two seasons were made up of pointless filler just to give the manga time to get ahead, as well as negate the need for pointless filler episodes sprinkled throughout. The fact that the writers know that the show represents a large portion of the series\u2019 viewership means that they\u2019ve tried to give some consequence to the filler episodes and have them actually tie in to the plot rather than just being forgotten about and ignored after the episode is over. \n\nExcept fuck the Cho-cho episodes. All my homies hate the Cho-cho episodes",

None of the big hax, none of the big chakra, none of the big OP jutsu like Flying Raijin, Byakuyo seal etc. An intellect and a powerful throwable chidori.\n\nMaybe that's Jonin+, maybe low-kage level.

Tsunade was almost as fast as the Raikage, who also fought KCM1 Naruto so it makes sense to say that Sakura would be around as fast as those characters.

Anything that doesn't kill her instantly is essentially useless, her healing power speaks for itself.\n\nAnd in her novel Sakura tanked a psuedo jinjuriki biju bomb. Its safe to say none of Kakashi's lightning or water style is going to be effective. \n\nSo kamui is his only weapon and I did say its not clear how fast that is exactly. So I can't just say she'd straight up dodge it. My guess though is that its slow because like you said he would've been sniping everyone's head off. \n\nAnd you can't just dismiss the cherry blossom clash. She's able to essentially nuke the battlefield and even if Kakashi comes out of that unharmed, it still serves as a smoke screen and since Kakashi doesn't have sensory abilities those few seconds of smoke and boulders flying everywhere are more than enough for Sakura to charge him, or at least to prevent him from using kamui which requires line of sight.\n\nAnd you may not realize, even if he could just blitz snipe her, there's this little thing called substitution jutsu, that Sakura in particular is known for using consecutively. So Kakashi is really going to have to be careful with his timing to make sure he doesn't waste all that chakra that a kamui snipe would require.\n\n He'd have to wait for the perfect moment and I doubt he'd be able to keep up with her at all. He'd probably have to just wait til she ran out of chakra, which could be hours, but then he'd have to make sure he still has enough chakra left for a kamui snipe.\n\nI don't see how you think he could win even if he were faster, nothing gets past that healing, with substitution as insurance.",

                    "body": ">Tsunade was almost as fast as the Raikage, who also fought KCM1 Naruto so it makes sense to say that Sakura would be around as fast as those characters. And I'm pretty sure KCM1 Naruto is faster than Kakashi.\n\nTsunade speed =/= Sakura speed.  Just cause she kept up with Raikage doesn't mean Sakura could. Kakashi actually briefly threw hands with Sasuke who fight with Raikage.\n\n>And yes Sakura can straight up tank anything other than kamui. Tsunade tanked susano, yasaka beads, and phoenix flower. Anything that doesn't kill her instantly is essentially useless, her healing power speaks for itself.\n\nShe barely tanked it (Sakura) and she didn't lose any limbs when it happened. Kakashi can take her heart out with Raikiri and she wouldn't be able to react. We all know Kakashi is smart enough to set it up for a direct hit as well so even if he doesn't get her heart, she can't regain a lost limb if he were to cut any arm/leg.\n\nAnd Tsunade is not Sakura. Once Sakura actually tanks all of those there's no way to know she can tank it. \n\n>So kamui is his only weapon and I did say its not clear how fast that is exactly. So I can't just say she'd straight up dodge it. My guess though is that its slow because like you said he would've been sniping everyone's head off. \n\nI said it's because Kamui would ends fights too fast and it would kill the story. It should be instantaneous  or close to that cause Kakashi used Kamui on Narutos rasengan right infront of Obito but he didn't even see it. \n\n\n>And you can't just dismiss the cherry blossom clash. She's able to essentially nuke the battlefield and even if Kakashi comes out of that unharmed, it still serves as a smoke screen and since Kakashi doesn't have sensory abilities those few seconds of smoke and boulders flying everywhere are more than enough for Sakura to charge him\n\nSharingan can see the whole Chakra flow and even tiny bits of Chakra in the air like what Sasuke saw vs Deidara. She can't hide from him at all in this fight.\n\n>And you may not realize, even if he could just blitz snipe her, there's this little thing called substitution jutsu\n\nThat jutsu is confusing but I'm pretty sure the user has to get hit by the attack first. Substitution can't work on Kamui if that's actually how it works. Tbh I'm not sure tho.\n\n>He'd have to wait for the perfect moment and I doubt he'd be able to keep up with her at all. He'd probably have to just wait til she ran out of chakra, which could be hours, but then he'd have to make sure he still has enough chakra left for a kamui snipe.\n\nChakra doesn't mean anything if she loses a limb. She can out last him but he can definitely immobilize her and take the win.\n\n>I don't see how you think he could win even if he were faster, nothing gets past that healing, with substitution as insurance.\n\nSubtitution Justu won't do anything for her because kakashi's main two moves are are fatal jutsus and she has to avoid them. I honestly don't see a way she can win this fight.\n\nAnd she's not stronger than Tsunade unless in her novels they gave her some BS made up strength. She's strong and in the same tier as kakahshi and Tsunade but she's just a bit weaker.",

I've never seen anyone question that before, even the normal people who hate on Sakura accept that she surpassed Tsunade, maybe not in healing but certainly so in taijutsu. There's no reason for you to believe that Sakura isn't stronger and faster than her. The fact that Sakura tanked a psuedo jinjuriki biju bomb, without her healing even activated, only confirms that she has that same toughness as Tsunade. \n\nSakura is just a beast, a taijutsu master with literally overpowered healing abilities that make her an unkillable tank. \n\nAnd, again, you can't dismiss the cherry blossom clash. I know for a fact that sharingan cannot see through smoke screens, only byakugan can do that. I know because in Sasuke's fight against Killer Bee, he specifically asked Karin to sense Bee out after he tried to attack Karin, Suigetu and Jugo with a chakra cloak lariet, and his attack,  like the cherry blossom clash, threw a screen of dust in the air. Its clear that Sasuke could not see through that smoke. And Killer Bee knowing this tried to charge Sasuke from the smoke with a lariet, which is essentially what Sakura would do to Kakashi. And she can pretty much spam this ability. \n\nI think you really need to just rethink your evaluation of Sakura.",

Sakura can't survive a real Bijuu bomb and those novels aren't even canon so there's no reason to bring those up. Sakura is not stronger than Tsunade. Hashirama saying she's stronger doesn't mean anything because all he literally saw her do was punch the ground and nothing else for the whole war and he's never seen Tsunade since she was a kid.\n\nSasuke asked Karin to sense killer Bee because he was moving way too fast to even locate. He even says \"He's too fast but since he moves in a linear fashion, I can make out his movements\" and then asks Karin to tell him where he is all times. [Sasuke telling deidara he saw his bombs underground because he sees the chakra.](http://imgur.com/a/ua2Yuof). If he can see underground then he can see through a cloud of smoke easily.\n\nShe can't heal from lost limbs and Kakashi can speed blitz her with raikiri. There's no way she beats him and Kamui can definitely kill her and we know Kakashi can use Kamui on fast things since he used it on Pains missiles.\n\nI think your overrating Sakura and you need to rethink yours. You keep acting like Sakuras strong but there's no proof of her ever reaching tsunades level. Kakashi was actually fighting and getting hit by real bijuu's instead of fake bijuus in a filler novel.",

I'm confident that dms obito or kakashi could solo fused momoshiki or isshiki with little to no difficulty. Dms kamui is too OP and taking away obitos bonus amps just make it OP for shorter time.\n\n\n\nAnd no lmao tsunade is absolutely not stronger than kakashi. While losing the sharingan was a nerf just to kakashis reaction speed and kamui, his stamina massively increased and he developed new techniques. Not to mention that as i said he either remained or gained more speed. Not to mention he still knows over 1000 jutsus. Kakashi was already a huge threat before but now he has MASSIVELY more stamina, more knowledge+experience, new techniques etc\n\n\n\nAnd Hiruzen is actually a big joke. He has exactly 0 impressive feats and the only thing going for him are empty vague statements. He doesn't know every jutsu in existence he was stated to know all konoha jutsu. Now the only jutsu canonically stated as \"konoha jutsu\" is 1000 years of pain. He didn't use any clan jutsu and doesn't have kekkei genkai so the most we can wank him to is that he knows a lot of elemental techniques. Now kakashi knows over a 1000 techniques so we can actually say he knows more AND has a LOT more stamina. In a battle between the kakashi and Hiruzen or tsunade kakashi would just blitz and decapitate them.",

I can pull up real sources indicating that he is the fastest physically in the show, but I cannot in any way imagine Hashirama or Gara to be anywhere near as fast. Minato was known for being faster than Tobirama, who was the previous fastest alive.\n\n\nA plan doesn\u2019t need to be complicated to be spectacular, it just has to be effective.

There\u2019s shit like Sasuke\u2019s being constantly out of chakra at the most inconvenient times/generally being nerfed, but you could argue that the writers had to do that after the corner they wrote themselves into with Naruto and Sasuke\u2019s power at the end of Shippuden. \n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen it said elsewhere, but the Boruto manga is pretty lit (especially rn). In a way it\u2019s like seeing what Naruto could\u2019ve been like if he didn\u2019t have the nine-tails, grew up with a stable home life and an OP dad. Boruto acts kinda whiney and spoiled towards the beginning but that\u2019s also a part of his character development. Because he never lived in the world that Naruto and then grew up with and only knew peace, he takes a lot of stuff for granted. It\u2019s not until shit starts to hit the fan that he wisens up and comes into his own as a shinobi.\n\nBoruto also tackles the idea of what times of peace can do for technological development, and similarly, what that does to the society that develops around that technology. It\u2019s interesting to see the clash of ideologies between those who think a shinobi\u2019s power should be their own and no one else\u2019s vs those who feel like technology is meant to enhance lives and give even more strength to make up for the short-comings of the individual. \n\nAlso, the manga has random jumps in time that seem to be intended to build in spots for the anime to put some filler material, which as we\u2019ve found recently actually does tie into the manga. I won\u2019t say too much but like characters that didn\u2019t mean much in the manga are built up more in the anime, and events that happen off-panel in the manga are animated in the show. Some people dislike this because of what it does for the pacing of the manga, but personally, I think it\u2019s a good thing because it\u2019s intended to help the series avoid situations like the end of OG Naruto where the entirety of the last two seasons were made up of pointless filler just to give the manga time to get ahead, as well as negate the need for pointless filler episodes sprinkled throughout. The fact that the writers know that the show represents a large portion of the series\u2019 viewership means that they\u2019ve tried to give some consequence to the filler episodes and have them actually tie in to the plot rather than just being forgotten about and ignored after the episode is over. \n\nExcept fuck the Cho-cho episodes. All my homies hate the Cho-cho episodes",

And I'm pretty sure KCM1 Naruto is faster than Kakashi.\n\nTsunade speed =/= Sakura speed.  Just cause she kept up with Raikage doesn't mean Sakura could. Kakashi actually briefly threw hands with Sasuke who fight with Raikage.\n\n>And yes Sakura can straight up tank anything other than kamui. Tsunade tanked susano, yasaka beads, and phoenix flower. Anything that doesn't kill her instantly is essentially useless, her healing power speaks for itself.\n\nShe barely tanked it (Sakura) and she didn't lose any limbs when it happened. Kakashi can take her heart out with Raikiri and she wouldn't be able to react. We all know Kakashi is smart enough to set it up for a direct hit as well so even if he doesn't get her heart, she can't regain a lost limb if he were to cut any arm/leg.\n\nAnd Tsunade is not Sakura. Once Sakura actually tanks all of those there's no way to know she can tank it. \n\n>So kamui is his only weapon and I did say its not clear how fast that is exactly. So I can't just say she'd straight up dodge it. My guess though is that its slow because like you said he would've been sniping everyone's head off. \n\nI said it's because Kamui would ends fights too fast and it would kill the story. It should be instantaneous  or close to that cause Kakashi used Kamui on Narutos rasengan right infront of Obito but he didn't even see it. \n\n\n>And you can't just dismiss the cherry blossom clash. She's able to essentially nuke the battlefield and even if Kakashi comes out of that unharmed, it still serves as a smoke screen and since Kakashi doesn't have sensory abilities those few seconds of smoke and boulders flying everywhere are more than enough for Sakura to charge him\n\nSharingan can see the whole Chakra flow and even tiny bits of Chakra in the air like what Sasuke saw vs Deidara. She can't hide from him at all in this fight.\n\n>And you may not realize, even if he could just blitz snipe her, there's this little thing called substitution jutsu\n\nThat jutsu is confusing but I'm pretty sure the user has to get hit by the attack first. Substitution can't work on Kamui if that's actually how it works. Tbh I'm not sure tho.\n\n>He'd have to wait for the perfect moment and I doubt he'd be able to keep up with her at all. He'd probably have to just wait til she ran out of chakra, which could be hours, but then he'd have to make sure he still has enough chakra left for a kamui snipe.\n\nChakra doesn't mean anything if she loses a limb. She can out last him but he can definitely immobilize her and take the win.\n\n>I don't see how you think he could win even if he were faster, nothing gets past that healing, with substitution as insurance.\n\nSubtitution Justu won't do anything for her because kakashi's main two moves are are fatal jutsus and she has to avoid them. I honestly don't see a way she can win this fight.\n\nAnd she's not stronger than Tsunade unless in her novels they gave her some BS made up strength. She's strong and in the same tier as kakahshi and Tsunade but she's just a bit weaker.",

I've never seen anyone question that before, even the normal people who hate on Sakura accept that she surpassed Tsunade, maybe not in healing but certainly so in taijutsu. There's no reason for you to believe that Sakura isn't stronger and faster than her. The fact that Sakura tanked a psuedo jinjuriki biju bomb, without her healing even activated, only confirms that she has that same toughness as Tsunade. \n\nSakura is just a beast, a taijutsu master with literally overpowered healing abilities that make her an unkillable tank. \n\nAnd, again, you can't dismiss the cherry blossom clash. I know for a fact that sharingan cannot see through smoke screens, only byakugan can do that. I know because in Sasuke's fight against Killer Bee, he specifically asked Karin to sense Bee out after he tried to attack Karin, Suigetu and Jugo with a chakra cloak lariet, and his attack,  like the cherry blossom clash, threw a screen of dust in the air. Its clear that Sasuke could not see through that smoke. And Killer Bee knowing this tried to charge Sasuke from the smoke with a lariet, which is essentially what Sakura would do to Kakashi. And she can pretty much spam this ability. \n\nI think you really need to just rethink your evaluation of Sakura.",

He even says \"He's too fast but since he moves in a linear fashion, I can make out his movements\" and then asks Karin to tell him where he is all times.

If he can see underground then he can see through a cloud of smoke easily.\n\nShe can't heal from lost limbs and Kakashi can speed blitz her with raikiri. There's no way she beats him and Kamui can definitely kill her and we know Kakashi can use Kamui on fast things since he used it on Pains missiles.\n\nI think your overrating Sakura and you need to rethink yours.

Kakashi was the only one not fighting Obito directly, I'm pretty sure it was because he knew he wasn't as fast as Naruto and Guy.\n\nJust watching that fight and how Kakashi used kamui, I don't think he would be at all able to kamui snipe KCM1 Naruto, meaning he couldn't do it to Sakura either.",

It works against any attack. So he'll probably have to keep trying even if he can just snipe her, and each time she subs is an opportunity to counter attack. \n\nSo even if he does have the advantage I don't think you could just say he beats her hands down, she still has a valid approach to the battle.",

While losing the sharingan was a nerf just to kakashis reaction speed and kamui, his stamina massively increased and he developed new techniques. Not to mention that as i said he either remained or gained more speed. Not to mention he still knows over 1000 jutsus. Kakashi was already a huge threat before but now he has MASSIVELY more stamina, more knowledge+experience, new techniques etc\n\n\n\nAnd Hiruzen is actually a big joke. He has exactly 0 impressive feats and the only thing going for him are empty vague statements. He doesn't know every jutsu in existence he was stated to know all konoha jutsu. Now the only jutsu canonically stated as \"konoha jutsu\" is 1000 years of pain. He didn't use any clan jutsu and doesn't have kekkei genkai so the most we can wank him to is that he knows a lot of elemental techniques. Now kakashi knows over a 1000 techniques so we can actually say he knows more AND has a LOT more stamina.

Sasukes sharingan doesn't boost his physical speed meaning he's faster than him even in base. Tobirama, madara, hashirama, possibly prime Naruto, gaara etc are all faster as well (obviously all otsutsiki but those are not ninja).\n\n\n\nAnd no Minato literally jumped at obito himself with kcm2 on but couldn't react in time while edo tobirama did.\n\n\n\"but I do believe in the War arc Minato\u2019s lightning quick plan to help 8G Guy take on Juudara was more impressive than Tobirama\u2019s feat. \"\nNo. No it wasn't. Minato saw Guy is going to fight madara and had plenty of time to make up a strategy. And all he came up in such a long time was that Lee throws a kunai and Minato teleports away few TSO. Meanwhile tobirama could create a clone, teleport to Minato, grab the tso and teleport to obito before Minato could think of anything. Even later it's Tobirama who points out that Minatos arm didn't heal back and figured out that TSO nullify all ninjutsu and how they work.\n\n\n\"Also Minato teleporting those triple-H bomb Jubi-damas to the middle of the ocean puts him an edge over Tobirama\u2019s teleportation of the TSO\"\nNope lol. Whenever Minato teleported a tbb away he had plenty of time to get ready and later Naruto even outsmarted Minato when they saved the alliance using ftg (something only Naruto came up with despite Minato also having 9 tails and ftg)",

I can pull up real sources indicating that he is the fastest physically in the show, but I cannot in any way imagine Hashirama or Gara to be anywhere near as fast. Minato was known for being faster than Tobirama, who was the previous fastest alive.\n\n\nA plan doesn\u2019t need to be complicated to be spectacular, it just has to be effective.

I've never seen anyone question that before, even the normal people who hate on Sakura accept that she surpassed Tsunade, maybe not in healing but certainly so in taijutsu. There's no reason for you to believe that Sakura isn't stronger and faster than her. The fact that Sakura tanked a psuedo jinjuriki biju bomb, without her healing even activated, only confirms that she has that same toughness as Tsunade. \n\nSakura is just a beast, a taijutsu master with literally overpowered healing abilities that make her an unkillable tank. \n\nAnd, again, you can't dismiss the cherry blossom clash. I know for a fact that sharingan cannot see through smoke screens, only byakugan can do that. I know because in Sasuke's fight against Killer Bee, he specifically asked Karin to sense Bee out after he tried to attack Karin, Suigetu and Jugo with a chakra cloak lariet, and his attack,  like the cherry blossom clash, threw a screen of dust in the air. Its clear that Sasuke could not see through that smoke. And Killer Bee knowing this tried to charge Sasuke from the smoke with a lariet, which is essentially what Sakura would do to Kakashi. And she can pretty much spam this ability. \n\nI think you really need to just rethink your evaluation of Sakura.",

Hashirama saying she's stronger doesn't mean anything because all he literally saw her do was punch the ground and nothing else for the whole war and he's never seen Tsunade since she was a kid.\n\nSasuke asked Karin to sense killer Bee because he was moving way too fast to even locate. He even says \"He's too fast but since he moves in a linear fashion, I can make out his movements\" and then asks Karin to tell him where he is all times. [Sasuke telling deidara he saw his bombs underground because he sees the chakra.](http://imgur.com/a/ua2Yuof). If he can see underground then he can see through a cloud of smoke easily.\n\nShe can't heal from lost limbs and Kakashi can speed blitz her with raikiri. There's no way she beats him and Kamui can definitely kill her and we know Kakashi can use Kamui on fast things since he used it on Pains missiles.\n\nI think your overrating Sakura and you need to rethink yours. You keep acting like Sakuras strong but there's no proof of her ever reaching tsunades level. Kakashi was actually fighting and getting hit by real bijuu's instead of fake bijuus in a filler novel.",

Kakashi was the only one not fighting Obito directly, I'm pretty sure it was because he knew he wasn't as fast as Naruto and Guy.\n\nJust watching that fight and how Kakashi used kamui, I don't think he would be at all able to kamui snipe KCM1 Naruto, meaning he couldn't do it to Sakura either.",

Meanwhile tobirama could create a clone, teleport to Minato, grab the tso and teleport to obito before Minato could think of anything.

Minato wasn't known to be faster than tobirama he's only better at ftg than him, not physical speed.\n\n\n\"A plan doesn\u2019t need to be complicated to be spectacular, it just has to be effective. Minatos plan was 100% effective.\" \n\nNo it wasn't. Madara still had some of his tso. Meanwhile Tobiramas plans were 100% effective. Minato had 20 seconds tobirama had like 1.\n\n\n\n\nFor the speed part take it like this. Minato = raikage. Kcm1 Naruto > raikage.

There's no way she beats him and Kamui can definitely kill her and we know Kakashi can use Kamui on fast things since he used it on Pains missiles.\n\nI think your overrating Sakura and you need to rethink yours. You keep acting like Sakuras strong but there's no proof of her ever reaching tsunades level. Kakashi was actually fighting and getting hit by real bijuu's instead of fake bijuus in a filler novel.",

Kakashi was the only one not fighting Obito directly, I'm pretty sure it was because he knew he wasn't as fast as Naruto and Guy.\n\nJust watching that fight and how Kakashi used kamui, I don't think he would be at all able to kamui snipe KCM1 Naruto, meaning he couldn't do it to Sakura either.",

Minato saw Guy is going to fight madara and had plenty of time to make up a strategy. And all he came up in such a long time was that Lee throws a kunai and Minato teleports away few TSO. Meanwhile tobirama could create a clone, teleport to Minato, grab the tso and teleport to obito before Minato could think of anything. Even later it's Tobirama who points out that Minatos arm didn't heal back and figured out that TSO nullify all ninjutsu and how they work.\n\n\n\"Also Minato teleporting those triple-H bomb Jubi-damas to the middle of the ocean puts him an edge over Tobirama\u2019s teleportation of the TSO\"\nNope lol. Whenever Minato teleported a tbb away he had plenty of time to get ready and later Naruto even outsmarted Minato when they saved the alliance using ftg (something only Naruto came up with despite Minato also having 9 tails and ftg)",

Also Hashirama is equal to Madara, but Madara is faster whilst Hashirama has more endurance. Equal does not mean the same stats.\n\n\nMinato pulled up perfect sage mode in 2 seconds of loading. He only says he is \u2018bad\u2019 at it because he does not like having to pause for 2 seconds. His sage mode charge time fastest we\u2019ve seen apart from Hashirama\u2019s instant sage mode.",

When you make a character god-level, you\u2019re gonna have a hard time power scaling going forward and making fights actually interesting, and this is an issue that most shonen anime have to deal with, it just goes with the territory",

Kakashi was the only one not fighting Obito directly, I'm pretty sure it was because he knew he wasn't as fast as Naruto and Guy.\n\nJust watching that fight and how Kakashi used kamui, I don't think he would be at all able to kamui snipe KCM1 Naruto, meaning he couldn't do it to Sakura either.",

Minatos raw speed is equal to 4th raikage. Meaning he's slower than like 20+ different characters in the series. It's actually pretty simple. Edo Madara was as fast or faster than 4th raikage, alive madara is faster than edo madara and tobirama is faster than madara. Meaning tobirama >madara >ay= Minato\n\n\n\"I get what you mean, but Tobirama is scientist-type smart more than battle-smart, whereas Minato is one of the top 2 most battle-smart shinobi in the series. \"\n\nNo tobirama displayed better intelligence feats in war arc than Minato. Minato is maybe like top 5 smartest characters in the series. We've literally seen kcm2 Minato couldn't do anything when Obito planted a TSO on him while tobirama instantly reacted, sent a clone, grabbed the tso and teleported it away. Tobirama by far surpasses Minato in almost every way except teleportation speed.",

Minato saw Guy is going to fight madara and had plenty of time to make up a strategy. And all he came up in such a long time was that Lee throws a kunai and Minato teleports away few TSO. Meanwhile tobirama could create a clone, teleport to Minato, grab the tso and teleport to obito before Minato could think of anything. Even later it's Tobirama who points out that Minatos arm didn't heal back and figured out that TSO nullify all ninjutsu and how they work.\n\n\n\"Also Minato teleporting those triple-H bomb Jubi-damas to the middle of the ocean puts him an edge over Tobirama\u2019s teleportation of the TSO\"\nNope lol. Whenever Minato teleported a tbb away he had plenty of time to get ready and later Naruto even outsmarted Minato when they saved the alliance using ftg (something only Naruto came up with despite Minato also having 9 tails and ftg)",

Minato is maybe like top 5 smartest characters in the series. We've literally seen kcm2 Minato couldn't do anything when Obito planted a TSO on him while tobirama instantly reacted, sent a clone, grabbed the tso and teleported it away.

Sasukes sharingan doesn't boost his physical speed meaning he's faster than him even in base.

Minato saw Guy is going to fight madara and had plenty of time to make up a strategy. And all he came up in such a long time was that Lee throws a kunai and Minato teleports away few TSO. Meanwhile tobirama could create a clone, teleport to Minato, grab the tso and teleport to obito before Minato could think of anything. Even later it's Tobirama who points out that Minatos arm didn't heal back and figured out that TSO nullify all ninjutsu and how they work.\n\n\n\"Also Minato teleporting those triple-H bomb Jubi-damas to the middle of the ocean puts him an edge over Tobirama\u2019s teleportation of the TSO\"\nNope lol. Whenever Minato teleported a tbb away he had plenty of time to get ready and later Naruto even outsmarted Minato when they saved the alliance using ftg (something only Naruto came up with despite Minato also having 9 tails and ftg)",

Sasukes sharingan doesn't boost his physical speed meaning he's faster than him even in base. Tobirama, madara, hashirama, possibly prime Naruto, gaara etc are all faster as well (obviously all otsutsiki but those are not ninja).\n\n\n\nAnd no Minato literally jumped at obito himself with kcm2 on but couldn't react in time while edo tobirama did.\n\n\n\"but I do believe in the War arc Minato\u2019s lightning quick plan to help 8G Guy take on Juudara was more impressive than Tobirama\u2019s feat. \"\nNo. No it wasn't. Minato saw Guy is going to fight madara and had plenty of time to make up a strategy. And all he came up in such a long time was that Lee throws a kunai and Minato teleports away few TSO. Meanwhile tobirama could create a clone, teleport to Minato, grab the tso and teleport to obito before Minato could think of anything. Even later it's Tobirama who points out that Minatos arm didn't heal back and figured out that TSO nullify all ninjutsu and how they work.\n\n\n\"Also Minato teleporting those triple-H bomb Jubi-damas to the middle of the ocean puts him an edge over Tobirama\u2019s teleportation of the TSO\"\nNope lol. Whenever Minato teleported a tbb away he had plenty of time to get ready and later Naruto even outsmarted Minato when they saved the alliance using ftg (something only Naruto came up with despite Minato also having 9 tails and ftg)",

The only one who actually even has base form speed feats are Sasuke, and while he is definitely really fast he isn\u2019t going to win a running race against Minato, hailed as the Yellow Flash by Shinobi everywhere and the god of speed by quite a few watchers. I can pull up real sources indicating that he is the fastest physically in the show, but I cannot in any way imagine Hashirama or Gara to be anywhere near as fast. Minato was known for being faster than Tobirama, who was the previous fastest alive.\n\n\nA plan doesn\u2019t need to be complicated to be spectacular, it just has to be effective. Minatos plan was 100% effective.\n\n\nI don\u2019t think he has that much time to plan: 20 seconds at most from the moment that Jubidama was charged to the moment it was shot.",

Kakashi was the only one not fighting Obito directly, I'm pretty sure it was because he knew he wasn't as fast as Naruto and Guy.\n\nJust watching that fight and how Kakashi used kamui, I don't think he would be at all able to kamui snipe KCM1 Naruto, meaning he couldn't do it to Sakura either.",

It works against any attack. So he'll probably have to keep trying even if he can just snipe her, and each time she subs is an opportunity to counter attack. \n\nSo even if he does have the advantage I don't think you could just say he beats her hands down, she still has a valid approach to the battle.",

Minatos raw speed is equal to 4th raikage. Meaning he's slower than like 20+ different characters in the series. It's actually pretty simple. Edo Madara was as fast or faster than 4th raikage, alive madara is faster than edo madara and tobirama is faster than madara. Meaning tobirama >madara >ay= Minato\n\n\n\"I get what you mean, but Tobirama is scientist-type smart more than battle-smart, whereas Minato is one of the top 2 most battle-smart shinobi in the series. \"\n\nNo tobirama displayed better intelligence feats in war arc than Minato. Minato is maybe like top 5 smartest characters in the series. We've literally seen kcm2 Minato couldn't do anything when Obito planted a TSO on him while tobirama instantly reacted, sent a clone, grabbed the tso and teleported it away. Tobirama by far surpasses Minato in almost every way except teleportation speed.",

Sasukes sharingan doesn't boost his physical speed meaning he's faster than him even in base.

Minato saw Guy is going to fight madara and had plenty of time to make up a strategy. And all he came up in such a long time was that Lee throws a kunai and Minato teleports away few TSO. Meanwhile tobirama could create a clone, teleport to Minato, grab the tso and teleport to obito before Minato could think of anything. Even later it's Tobirama who points out that Minatos arm didn't heal back and figured out that TSO nullify all ninjutsu and how they work.\n\n\n\"Also Minato teleporting those triple-H bomb Jubi-damas to the middle of the ocean puts him an edge over Tobirama\u2019s teleportation of the TSO\"\nNope lol. Whenever Minato teleported a tbb away he had plenty of time to get ready and later Naruto even outsmarted Minato when they saved the alliance using ftg (something only Naruto came up with despite Minato also having 9 tails and ftg)",

Minato saw Guy is going to fight madara and had plenty of time to make up a strategy. And all he came up in such a long time was that Lee throws a kunai and Minato teleports away few TSO. Meanwhile tobirama could create a clone, teleport to Minato, grab the tso and teleport to obito before Minato could think of anything. Even later it's Tobirama who points out that Minatos arm didn't heal back and figured out that TSO nullify all ninjutsu and how they work.\n\n\n\"Also Minato teleporting those triple-H bomb Jubi-damas to the middle of the ocean puts him an edge over Tobirama\u2019s teleportation of the TSO\"\nNope lol.

The only one who actually even has base form speed feats are Sasuke, and while he is definitely really fast he isn\u2019t going to win a running race against Minato, hailed as the Yellow Flash by Shinobi everywhere and the god of speed by quite a few watchers. I can pull up real sources indicating that he is the fastest physically in the show, but I cannot in any way imagine Hashirama or Gara to be anywhere near as fast. Minato was known for being faster than Tobirama, who was the previous fastest alive.\n\n\nA plan doesn\u2019t need to be complicated to be spectacular, it just has to be effective. Minatos plan was 100% effective.\n\n\nI don\u2019t think he has that much time to plan: 20 seconds at most from the moment that Jubidama was charged to the moment it was shot.",

Edo Madara was as fast or faster than 4th raikage, alive madara is faster than edo madara and tobirama is faster than madara. Meaning tobirama >madara >ay= Minato\n\n\n\"I get what you mean, but Tobirama is scientist-type smart more than battle-smart, whereas Minato is one of the top 2 most battle-smart shinobi in the series. \"\n\nNo tobirama displayed better intelligence feats in war arc than Minato. Minato is maybe like top 5 smartest characters in the series. We've literally seen kcm2 Minato couldn't do anything when Obito planted a TSO on him while tobirama instantly reacted, sent a clone, grabbed the tso and teleported it away. Tobirama by far surpasses Minato in almost every way except teleportation speed.",

Minato saw Guy is going to fight madara and had plenty of time to make up a strategy. And all he came up in such a long time was that Lee throws a kunai and Minato teleports away few TSO. Meanwhile tobirama could create a clone, teleport to Minato, grab the tso and teleport to obito before Minato could think of anything. Even later it's Tobirama who points out that Minatos arm didn't heal back and figured out that TSO nullify all ninjutsu and how they work.\n\n\n\"Also Minato teleporting those triple-H bomb Jubi-damas to the middle of the ocean puts him an edge over Tobirama\u2019s teleportation of the TSO\"\nNope lol.

It works against any attack. So he'll probably have to keep trying even if he can just snipe her, and each time she subs is an opportunity to counter attack. \n\nSo even if he does have the advantage I don't think you could just say he beats her hands down, she still has a valid approach to the battle.",

Minato saw Guy is going to fight madara and had plenty of time to make up a strategy. And all he came up in such a long time was that Lee throws a kunai and Minato teleports away few TSO. Meanwhile tobirama could create a clone, teleport to Minato, grab the tso and teleport to obito before Minato could think of anything. Even later it's Tobirama who points out that Minatos arm didn't heal back and figured out that TSO nullify all ninjutsu and how they work.\n\n\n\"Also Minato teleporting those triple-H bomb Jubi-damas to the middle of the ocean puts him an edge over Tobirama\u2019s teleportation of the TSO\"\nNope lol. Whenever Minato teleported a tbb away he had plenty of time to get ready and later Naruto even outsmarted Minato when they saved the alliance using ftg (something only Naruto came up with despite Minato also having 9 tails and ftg)",

Tobirama, madara, hashirama, possibly prime Naruto, gaara etc are all faster as well (obviously all otsutsiki but those are not ninja).\n\n\n\nAnd no Minato literally jumped at obito himself with kcm2 on but couldn't react in time while edo tobirama did.\n\n\n\"but I do believe in the War arc Minato\u2019s lightning quick plan to help 8G Guy take on Juudara was more impressive than Tobirama\u2019s feat. \"\nNo. No it wasn't. Minato saw Guy is going to fight madara and had plenty of time to make up a strategy. And all he came up in such a long time was that Lee throws a kunai and Minato teleports away few TSO. Meanwhile tobirama could create a clone, teleport to Minato, grab the tso and teleport to obito before Minato could think of anything. Even later it's Tobirama who points out that Minatos arm didn't heal back and figured out that TSO nullify all ninjutsu and how they work.\n\n\n\"Also Minato teleporting those triple-H bomb Jubi-damas to the middle of the ocean puts him an edge over Tobirama\u2019s teleportation of the TSO\"\nNope lol. Whenever Minato teleported a tbb away he had plenty of time to get ready and later Naruto even outsmarted Minato when they saved the alliance using ftg (something only Naruto came up with despite Minato also having 9 tails and ftg)",

I can pull up real sources indicating that he is the fastest physically in the show, but I cannot in any way imagine Hashirama or Gara to be anywhere near as fast.
