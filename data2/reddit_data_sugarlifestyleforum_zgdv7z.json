    "body": "I posted on here in July of 2020 about having the best and worst week of my life. My SGF of five years was moving in with me the same week I found out that  my cancer had returned . I told her that she hadn't signed up for that.  I knew this time my cancer would be more advanced than the first time I was diagnosed. I would understand if she changed her mind about moving in. She took my hand and looked me in the eyes and told me we would get through this together. \n\nNeither one of us knew what lay ahead for us. We met with the cancer center and I was told there were three experimental treatment options that may prolong my life. My other option was to use the chemo they used last time I had cancer but it would exceed what a person should have in their lifetime. The doctors told us that my chance of living though the chemo treatment's was low. \n\nWe chose the fourth option and I completed 9 rounds of chemo, loosing my hair and 50 pounds. My doctor told us that this type of cancer is aggressive and typically comes back within two years. Two years ago today I finished my chemo treatments. B had given me the will to live, the reason to fight and I did not want leave her. We had gone thought a lot together and grown closer these last two years.\n\nWe went to the doctor today and my blood work is clean.  My doctor told me that I had beaten the odds. My cancer is in remission. My hair has grown back and I gained back my weight. My doctor told me to go live life and enjoy it. \n\nNo matter how bad things have been she has always been there for me. Today we celebrate the two bonus years that we have had and look forward to sharing many more years together.",

Women like OPs SGF are spoiled way more then these NSA SB that call men cheap. They\u2019re not attracting high value men. It\u2019s a self fulfilling prophecy",
