    "body": "I was in a really nice 2 1/2 year arrangement.  I am single and stayed faithful to my SB, but I did agree that she could go on random dates as long as she was discreet.  Things went very well until she started canceling or changing the days and times of our dates. She ended up meeting a guy that she really liked and recently revealed that she has been dating him very seriously for the past six months and that some of the allowance I gave her is being used to give the bf gifts, meals etc. I told her that I was happy for her, but I\u2019m not really comfortable supporting their relationship so I wished her well and ended it. She went ballistic for about a week, saying I should be able to ignore her personal life (even though it affected our arrangement) and continue seeing her. \nI told her that the erratic changes to our schedule and the total priority given to the bf, made continuing impossible for me. I\u2019m disappointed to lose her, but I felt I had to draw the line somewhere.  Any similar experiences?",

We both have admitted to having deeper feelings, so I would very much be open to long term if he felt otherwise, but that isn\u2019t on the table. While I empathize that is sucks having someone chosen over you, in my case (and probably many other girls) it boils down to the reasons he chose an arrangement that will eventually be why I leave. My only suggestion, take with a grain of salt, is to recognize whether you are searching for long term and discuss whether that\u2019s compatible with her life goals as well. \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffbbest of luck in finding what you seek",

The SB is basically telling OP that she sleeps with this other guy and gives him money (gifts , etc) because that\u2019s how much better he is than you (who has to be the one giving money). It also grates on an older guy that a younger guy is being supported like that when traditionally even that younger guy should be the gift giver. \u201cHe can\u2019t even be a proper man and she still prefers him to some stupid degree\u201d. \n\nThat\u2019s what goes through my head at least.

That amount isn\u2019t nearly as much of an issue now, but from that experience, I learned a very important lesson about partner worthiness and finding someone who will support me through a career transition, instead of just happily letting me pay because I feel like I *should* contribute in order to keep him when I\u2019m in no place to do so. Thankfully, he ended things after that weekend trip. I haven\u2019t made the same mistake since. \n\nAnyway, I blame it on Disney and the idea that he could have been \u201cthe one\u201d that I was doing everything I could to keep. I feel sorry for early 2020 me who thought he was actually a worthy partner, but I\u2019ve forgiven her because we\u2019ve learned and grown a lot since then.",

She is impressive, and I consider the existence of her boyfriend part of the price of being with her. She is discreet about her relationship, and although we have become very close over time and know a lot about each other's lives, she understands that I don't want to know much about her boyfriend.\n\nI don't understand why it bothers you that she used a part of her allowance for him. In fact, after accidentally finding out who my SB is dating, I can safely say I would prefer it if he was a broke loser she subsidizes.\n\nReading your post it sounds like your SB was the one who changed the terms of your arrangement by canceling dates repeatedly. So, I understand your reaction.",

It was her new boyfriend, so I was quiet while they talked, but realized it was time to end things. They're now married with a kid and I wonder if their marriage will survive because it started with her deceiving him. Based on social media, they look happy together, but that doesn't always tell the full story.",

If you want true commitment from either side, then you need to engage and pursue a traditional relationship. Many SBs complain about SDs being too controlling when the obvious resolution is just to end it; but obviously the financial benefit keeps them there. Same with SDs.

I felt the need to be seen as an equal partner, so I put over a hundo on a credit card for food and drinks and such for us while there, with obviously no hope of paying it off anytime soon. That amount isn\u2019t nearly as much of an issue now, but from that experience, I learned a very important lesson about partner worthiness and finding someone who will support me through a career transition, instead of just happily letting me pay because I feel like I *should* contribute in order to keep him when I\u2019m in no place to do so. Thankfully, he ended things after that weekend trip. I haven\u2019t made the same mistake since. \n\nAnyway, I blame it on Disney and the idea that he could have been \u201cthe one\u201d that I was doing everything I could to keep. I feel sorry for early 2020 me who thought he was actually a worthy partner, but I\u2019ve forgiven her because we\u2019ve learned and grown a lot since then.",

Or, just end it because we are all adults and no one is tied to any of these arrangements. I think it\u2019s strange that there is this sense of entitlement on both the SB and SD side. If you want true commitment from either side, then you need to engage and pursue a traditional relationship. Many SBs complain about SDs being too controlling when the obvious resolution is just to end it; but obviously the financial benefit keeps them there. Same with SDs.  SBs are plentiful, especially if you have the means to support them.",

It\u2019s extremely disrespectful. If you read most of the other comments, you will see the majority of the other SDs agree. I liked helping her. I was never interested in funding her relationship with someone else. She effectively ended the arrangement by shifting her priorities which caused me to shift mine.

While I empathize that is sucks having someone chosen over you, in my case (and probably many other girls) it boils down to the reasons he chose an arrangement that will eventually be why I leave. My only suggestion, take with a grain of salt, is to recognize whether you are searching for long term and discuss whether that\u2019s compatible with her life goals as well. \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffbbest of luck in finding what you seek",

I felt the need to be seen as an equal partner, so I put over a hundo on a credit card for food and drinks and such for us while there, with obviously no hope of paying it off anytime soon. That amount isn\u2019t nearly as much of an issue now, but from that experience, I learned a very important lesson about partner worthiness and finding someone who will support me through a career transition, instead of just happily letting me pay because I feel like I *should* contribute in order to keep him when I\u2019m in no place to do so. Thankfully, he ended things after that weekend trip. I haven\u2019t made the same mistake since. \n\nAnyway, I blame it on Disney and the idea that he could have been \u201cthe one\u201d that I was doing everything I could to keep. I feel sorry for early 2020 me who thought he was actually a worthy partner, but I\u2019ve forgiven her because we\u2019ve learned and grown a lot since then.",

That amount isn\u2019t nearly as much of an issue now, but from that experience, I learned a very important lesson about partner worthiness and finding someone who will support me through a career transition, instead of just happily letting me pay because I feel like I *should* contribute in order to keep him when I\u2019m in no place to do so. Thankfully, he ended things after that weekend trip. I haven\u2019t made the same mistake since. \n\nAnyway, I blame it on Disney and the idea that he could have been \u201cthe one\u201d that I was doing everything I could to keep.
