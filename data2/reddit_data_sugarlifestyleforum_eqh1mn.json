    "body": "Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/encf7k/sds_how_would_you_feel_if_a_pot_or_sb_that_hadnt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nYALL LET ME TELL YOU... what a f-ing night! \n\nSo back up to where we left off. SD and I go to this lovely restaurant for lunch last week for a M&G. We\u2019re both super stoked because we had been talking for almost three weeks due to the timing of a cruise and wedding. \n\nWe have this great convo about how important face to face interactions are 1- generally and 2- esp in making business related decisions. I\u2019m over the moon because men my age don\u2019t enjoy having these types of conversations and I feel like SD and I are 100% on the same page. Our entire interaction feels very natural. I really enjoy listening to him talk and I\u2019m a sponge trying to absorb as much of what he\u2019s saying as possible. \n\nLunch ends and I follow up with a thank you text and he almost immediately asks if I\u2019d like to go to dinner next Friday (which was yesterday). I\u2019m like hell yes I cannot wait to shamelessly stare at you for 2 hours and eat delicious food! \n\nNow because lunch has left me feeling very stimulated from the fruitful conversations, I\u2019m also feeling a little sexually charged. I want to find a way to thank him. I buy him a copy of Face to Face by Brian Grazer and take a NSFW photo in some lingerie. I send the photo off to the pharmacy and set it for a 12+ pickup time. Ya girl is 100000% okay giving someone the picture but I felt so self conscious having it printed haha. \n\nFast forward to last night and I have the photo tucked into the book and it\u2019s just enough to be seen over the top to know somethings there. So we meet for dinner. I hand him the book and explain that I was very appreciative of the stimulating conversation and it left me feeling some type of way. He\u2019s flipping through the pages and sees the photo and looks up with these huge \u201coh my god\u201d eyes. The look alone was to die for. He\u2019s trying to think of words and is noticeably flustered (in a good way!!!!) and I feel like I\u2019ve hit the jackpot. Cloud nine. Quite chuffed with myself. He finds his words and his thanking me and I\u2019ve got this stupid smile on my face. \n\nThe dinner was phenomenal and he pulled the book out a few times to look at the photo again which in turn made me flustered and it felt so good. I love giving gifts in general but there was something extra special about this for some reason. \n\nFollowing dinner we went to his house because despite it being the second time together I just feel really safe and comfortable and adore this man tremendously already. \n\nWe end up having tea and sitting at his kitchen table for an hour or so just chatting. Again- the conversation flows so easily and it feels very natural. I kept having to remind myself that this is only the second time we\u2019ve been together and that we haven\u2019t been friends for years. \n\nNeedless to say the chemistry and compatibility translated beautifully into the bedroom! It was a perfect night and I\u2019m counting my lucky stars we get to do it again soon. \n\nMoral of the story: an NSFW \u201cbookmark\u201d in a thought out  book will be well received!\n\nEdit: forgot to add- in my original post u/HwdSD was asking very good questions about the photo lacking in technology. SD started laughing at one point and said \u201cis it sad that my natural instinct now is to try pinching it to zoom in?\u201d Hahaha gave me quite the chuckle. \n\nThank you to everyone who commented on the original post!",
