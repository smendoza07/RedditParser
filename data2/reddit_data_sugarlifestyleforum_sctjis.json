If SDs came on profile review saying worked at Micky Dees part time would get slayed.\n\n\\- To be a \"Attractive Member\" well by definition should be attractive.  If a broke guy cant be a SD then well a a way below avg looking girl shouldnt think could be a SB.\n\nThe Sugar Bowl myth has gone deep this winter.  Looking at SA literally any woman in thinks they can be a SB.  Before you downvote...Can any guy regardless of income be a SD?  Thought so!!!",

There are plenty of women on SLF that find success in the bowl (true SR success) and do not fit the conventional beauty standards that SDs tout here. Most of them probably don't even post about it, but several do. And we know SLF is but a tiny, tiny window into the sugar bowl; based on this, I'd imagine that the variety of SBs and SDs that are happily arranged would blow your mind and make you rethink your claims. Please stop spreading ill-informed misinformation, I hope the newbies read THIS comment under yours if they are looking for \"important truth\".",

You saw someone on a social media platform claim they make a shit ton of money and this is how they did it. Boom. An influx of girls who have absolutely no idea what they\u2019re doing make profiles. That shit will never go anywhere beyond reasons of \u201cthey\u2019re ugly\u201d. \n\nSA has been an absolute shit show with the quality of men on there. Unattractive and not as rich as they think they are. You know what I did? I didn\u2019t make a post bashing the men because they\u2019re unattractive or can\u2019t provide enough. I just moved on to the next best way of finding someone for a potential arrangement. \n\nIf you\u2019re basing your entire experience off of SA then that tells me everything I need to know lol. \n\nGenuinely curious. How long have you been in the bowl as a SD? What do you look like? What are you bringing to the table in an arrangement?\n\nMan I wish the tumblr sugar pages were a thing still.

No shade on those folks who cannot play in the same pool as many of the rest of us can. I wish SA was still a sugar site ,but it is not to be.

If any guy who fucks his neighbors' daughter and then reimburses her for the lipstick on his dick is a SD, then any guy can be one and any woman can be a SB. If we set our expectations of a SR a little higher, this is no longer true. Obviously, if we set it too high, it becomes a billionaire/famous model thing. For good reasons, there is no agreed-upon definition here of what constitutes an SR.",

A scar makeup could not cover. But she had style, flair, balls, brains\u2026and she was like 17 years older than me\u2026but certain men loved her, and would rob Peter pay Paul and wet water to get her whatever she wanted. It\u2019s not about looks. What you consider a total mess could be someone\u2019s dream girl. Just because a man is cheap and frugal with her doesn\u2019t mean he will be that way with me. We all have a different idea of what beautiful is. And if you\u2019re only concern is how \u201cattractive \u201c she is then you are shallow af.

Not meant to be mean or disrespectful, just a different level of perception. \n\nOh and one final thought, it takes more than money to be a successful sugar daddy. I have turned a thousand dollars into confetti and walked away without a second thought. You can\u2019t put a price tag on respect. All the money in the world won\u2019t make you any difference if you don\u2019t know how to treat people. And you have to live with the fact that the people around you only tolerate you because they are compensated. No one is ever solid\u2026",

Like who died and made them the spokespeople for ALL SD\u2019s & SB\u2019s. \n\nI\u2019m sorry but I had to say something and I\u2019ll definitely be leaving this thread.",

Sure beauty is in the eye of the beholder and it\u2019s fine for people to have their preferences, but not everyone is going to score high for desirability. \n\nNowadays everyone thinks they can be a SB and SA is flooded with profiles that, realistically, only exist to take up space. I\u2019m mainly talking about platonics, low effort profiles, and pic sellers but I think this also applies to SBs that deviate greatly from what most users are looking for. The same thing is true on sites OF (cam girls = SBs, only that the same phenomenon occurs there); people buy into the misconception that they\u2019ll be successful there\u2019s someone/something for everyone but that just isn\u2019t true.\n\nThe word \u201cconventional\u201d is also key here because it implies that\u2019s what the majority is looking for; if there are more unattractive SB profiles than attractive ones, then the majority of SDs (aka the ones who want the 5-10s) aren\u2019t going to renew their memberships because there\u2019s no point. They could find POTs on Tinder without paying monthly fees. \n\nNot sure why this concept is so hard for y\u2019all to grasp. If you\u2019re not a 5-10 and you\u2019ve found success then good for you!

The fact remains that you \"have no business\" saying that anyone would have no business being in the bowl. Period. If you're nervous your chances might be lower because some SDs will get tired of looking at average women's profiles so they won't renew their memberships, that sounds like a you problem. All women are allowed to take their chances at sugaring, and nobody gets to tell them otherwise. Each woman gets to decide for themselves, after giving it an honest try, if the bowl is for them. Not a pretentious stranger on the internet that wears her privilege like a badge.    \n\n\nAs for the rest of your comment, it completely deviates away from the point I was making which was that you insinuated that <5's need to move over for pretty privilege, so I don't feel the need to remark on any of it.",

A website that was the same kind of trash when I entered the bowl over ten years ago. \n\nI\u2019ve seen ALL kinds of women make it in the bowl for years. Of course it may be harder for someone who isn\u2019t your definition of pretty to find an arrangement but it\u2019s definitely not impossible. You seem more outraged that a person would even try to enter the bowl just because you don\u2019t find them to be pretty. Which is crazy to me. \n\nThe majority of the comments I\u2019m seeing that agree with OP are basically saying ugly and average looking people should not be in the bowl. Period. That\u2019s creating false hope. \n\nI\u2019m not naive. Of course you see some profiles and it\u2019s like alright now. You saw someone on a social media platform claim they make a shit ton of money and this is how they did it. Boom. An influx of girls who have absolutely no idea what they\u2019re doing make profiles. That shit will never go anywhere beyond reasons of \u201cthey\u2019re ugly\u201d. \n\nSA has been an absolute shit show with the quality of men on there. Unattractive and not as rich as they think they are. You know what I did? I didn\u2019t make a post bashing the men because they\u2019re unattractive or can\u2019t provide enough. I just moved on to the next best way of finding someone for a potential arrangement. \n\nIf you\u2019re basing your entire experience off of SA then that tells me everything I need to know lol. \n\nGenuinely curious. How long have you been in the bowl as a SD? What do you look like? What are you bringing to the table in an arrangement?\n\nMan I wish the tumblr sugar pages were a thing still.

If any guy who fucks his neighbors' daughter and then reimburses her for the lipstick on his dick is a SD, then any guy can be one and any woman can be a SB. If we set our expectations of a SR a little higher, this is no longer true. Obviously, if we set it too high, it becomes a billionaire/famous model thing. For good reasons, there is no agreed-upon definition here of what constitutes an SR.",

I\u2019m mainly talking about platonics, low effort profiles, and pic sellers but I think this also applies to SBs that deviate greatly from what most users are looking for. The same thing is true on sites OF (cam girls = SBs, only that the same phenomenon occurs there); people buy into the misconception that they\u2019ll be successful there\u2019s someone/something for everyone but that just isn\u2019t true.\n\nThe word \u201cconventional\u201d is also key here because it implies that\u2019s what the majority is looking for; if there are more unattractive SB profiles than attractive ones, then the majority of SDs (aka the ones who want the 5-10s) aren\u2019t going to renew their memberships because there\u2019s no point.

The fact remains that you \"have no business\" saying that anyone would have no business being in the bowl. Period. If you're nervous your chances might be lower because some SDs will get tired of looking at average women's profiles so they won't renew their memberships, that sounds like a you problem. All women are allowed to take their chances at sugaring, and nobody gets to tell them otherwise. Each woman gets to decide for themselves, after giving it an honest try, if the bowl is for them.

There are plenty of women on SLF that find success in the bowl (true SR success) and do not fit the conventional beauty standards that SDs tout here. Most of them probably don't even post about it, but several do. And we know SLF is but a tiny, tiny window into the sugar bowl; based on this, I'd imagine that the variety of SBs and SDs that are happily arranged would blow your mind and make you rethink your claims. Please stop spreading ill-informed misinformation, I hope the newbies read THIS comment under yours if they are looking for \"important truth\".",

If any guy who fucks his neighbors' daughter and then reimburses her for the lipstick on his dick is a SD, then any guy can be one and any woman can be a SB. If we set our expectations of a SR a little higher, this is no longer true. Obviously, if we set it too high, it becomes a billionaire/famous model thing. For good reasons, there is no agreed-upon definition here of what constitutes an SR.",

Sure beauty is in the eye of the beholder and it\u2019s fine for people to have their preferences, but not everyone is going to score high for desirability. \n\nNowadays everyone thinks they can be a SB and SA is flooded with profiles that, realistically, only exist to take up space. I\u2019m mainly talking about platonics, low effort profiles, and pic sellers but I think this also applies to SBs that deviate greatly from what most users are looking for. The same thing is true on sites OF (cam girls = SBs, only that the same phenomenon occurs there); people buy into the misconception that they\u2019ll be successful there\u2019s someone/something for everyone but that just isn\u2019t true.\n\nThe word \u201cconventional\u201d is also key here because it implies that\u2019s what the majority is looking for; if there are more unattractive SB profiles than attractive ones, then the majority of SDs (aka the ones who want the 5-10s) aren\u2019t going to renew their memberships because there\u2019s no point. They could find POTs on Tinder without paying monthly fees. \n\nNot sure why this concept is so hard for y\u2019all to grasp. If you\u2019re not a 5-10 and you\u2019ve found success then good for you!

Sure beauty is in the eye of the beholder and it\u2019s fine for people to have their preferences, but not everyone is going to score high for desirability.\n\nI could almost try to understand everything else in your comment, except you led with this. The fact remains that you \"have no business\" saying that anyone would have no business being in the bowl. Period. If you're nervous your chances might be lower because some SDs will get tired of looking at average women's profiles so they won't renew their memberships, that sounds like a you problem. All women are allowed to take their chances at sugaring, and nobody gets to tell them otherwise. Each woman gets to decide for themselves, after giving it an honest try, if the bowl is for them. Not a pretentious stranger on the internet that wears her privilege like a badge.    \n\n\nAs for the rest of your comment, it completely deviates away from the point I was making which was that you insinuated that <5's need to move over for pretty privilege, so I don't feel the need to remark on any of it.",

I could not be more proud of her.  \n\nThe reality is there are men and women whom will never really connect with that perfect person for them.  The one that looks past all of the physical unattractive qualities to find the inner beauty.  It is sad as hell.  Doesn\u2019t make it false.

Sure beauty is in the eye of the beholder and it\u2019s fine for people to have their preferences, but not everyone is going to score high for desirability. \n\nNowadays everyone thinks they can be a SB and SA is flooded with profiles that, realistically, only exist to take up space. I\u2019m mainly talking about platonics, low effort profiles, and pic sellers but I think this also applies to SBs that deviate greatly from what most users are looking for. The same thing is true on sites OF (cam girls = SBs, only that the same phenomenon occurs there); people buy into the misconception that they\u2019ll be successful there\u2019s someone/something for everyone but that just isn\u2019t true.\n\nThe word \u201cconventional\u201d is also key here because it implies that\u2019s what the majority is looking for; if there are more unattractive SB profiles than attractive ones, then the majority of SDs (aka the ones who want the 5-10s) aren\u2019t going to renew their memberships because there\u2019s no point. They could find POTs on Tinder without paying monthly fees. \n\nNot sure why this concept is so hard for y\u2019all to grasp. If you\u2019re not a 5-10 and you\u2019ve found success then good for you! There are always exceptions, but that\u2019s not going to be what most people experience in the bowl. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

The fact remains that you \"have no business\" saying that anyone would have no business being in the bowl. Period. If you're nervous your chances might be lower because some SDs will get tired of looking at average women's profiles so they won't renew their memberships, that sounds like a you problem. All women are allowed to take their chances at sugaring, and nobody gets to tell them otherwise. Each woman gets to decide for themselves, after giving it an honest try, if the bowl is for them. Not a pretentious stranger on the internet that wears her privilege like a badge.    \n\n\nAs for the rest of your comment, it completely deviates away from the point I was making which was that you insinuated that <5's need to move over for pretty privilege, so I don't feel the need to remark on any of it.",

A website that was the same kind of trash when I entered the bowl over ten years ago. \n\nI\u2019ve seen ALL kinds of women make it in the bowl for years. Of course it may be harder for someone who isn\u2019t your definition of pretty to find an arrangement but it\u2019s definitely not impossible. You seem more outraged that a person would even try to enter the bowl just because you don\u2019t find them to be pretty. Which is crazy to me. \n\nThe majority of the comments I\u2019m seeing that agree with OP are basically saying ugly and average looking people should not be in the bowl. Period. That\u2019s creating false hope. \n\nI\u2019m not naive. Of course you see some profiles and it\u2019s like alright now. You saw someone on a social media platform claim they make a shit ton of money and this is how they did it. Boom. An influx of girls who have absolutely no idea what they\u2019re doing make profiles. That shit will never go anywhere beyond reasons of \u201cthey\u2019re ugly\u201d. \n\nSA has been an absolute shit show with the quality of men on there. Unattractive and not as rich as they think they are. You know what I did? I didn\u2019t make a post bashing the men because they\u2019re unattractive or can\u2019t provide enough. I just moved on to the next best way of finding someone for a potential arrangement. \n\nIf you\u2019re basing your entire experience off of SA then that tells me everything I need to know lol. \n\nGenuinely curious. How long have you been in the bowl as a SD? What do you look like? What are you bringing to the table in an arrangement?\n\nMan I wish the tumblr sugar pages were a thing still.

Fortunately I am over 6ft, stocky dad bod, have a fairly interesting life, single, and fairly wealthy. \n\nI offer money. mentorship. and real connection.  My first SB went from working shit retail jobs at $10/hr to a high tech career making $80k a year in -4yrs.  What I helped teach her will make her a millionaire in her own time from her own hard work.  I helped her get off terrible anti anxiety meds and grow a sustainable life for herself.  I could not be more proud of her.  \n\nThe reality is there are men and women whom will never really connect with that perfect person for them.  The one that looks past all of the physical unattractive qualities to find the inner beauty.  It is sad as hell.  Doesn\u2019t make it false.  It just means we have to make our best life and find ways to be happy and healthy even if we are single.  Build a group of quality friends and share laughter and love with those around us.\n\nThe bowl is grueling and will absolutely hurt people\u2019s sense of self worth and self esteem.  There are too many people not emotionally strong enough in the bowl.  There will be lasting negative effects on both men and women.  That is my point.  \n\nI\u2019m not a gate keeper of the bowl.

The fact remains that you \"have no business\" saying that anyone would have no business being in the bowl. Period. If you're nervous your chances might be lower because some SDs will get tired of looking at average women's profiles so they won't renew their memberships, that sounds like a you problem.

You keep saying that math matters yet you\u2019re only basing your \u201cdata\u201d from SA. And in your area at that. A website that was the same kind of trash when I entered the bowl over ten years ago. \n\nI\u2019ve seen ALL kinds of women make it in the bowl for years. Of course it may be harder for someone who isn\u2019t your definition of pretty to find an arrangement but it\u2019s definitely not impossible. You seem more outraged that a person would even try to enter the bowl just because you don\u2019t find them to be pretty. Which is crazy to me. \n\nThe majority of the comments I\u2019m seeing that agree with OP are basically saying ugly and average looking people should not be in the bowl. Period. That\u2019s creating false hope. \n\nI\u2019m not naive. Of course you see some profiles and it\u2019s like alright now. You saw someone on a social media platform claim they make a shit ton of money and this is how they did it. Boom. An influx of girls who have absolutely no idea what they\u2019re doing make profiles. That shit will never go anywhere beyond reasons of \u201cthey\u2019re ugly\u201d. \n\nSA has been an absolute shit show with the quality of men on there. Unattractive and not as rich as they think they are. You know what I did? I didn\u2019t make a post bashing the men because they\u2019re unattractive or can\u2019t provide enough. I just moved on to the next best way of finding someone for a potential arrangement. \n\nIf you\u2019re basing your entire experience off of SA then that tells me everything I need to know lol. \n\nGenuinely curious. How long have you been in the bowl as a SD? What do you look like? What are you bringing to the table in an arrangement?\n\nMan I wish the tumblr sugar pages were a thing still.

Fortunately I am over 6ft, stocky dad bod, have a fairly interesting life, single, and fairly wealthy. \n\nI offer money. mentorship. and real connection.  My first SB went from working shit retail jobs at $10/hr to a high tech career making $80k a year in -4yrs.  What I helped teach her will make her a millionaire in her own time from her own hard work.  I helped her get off terrible anti anxiety meds and grow a sustainable life for herself.  I could not be more proud of her.  \n\nThe reality is there are men and women whom will never really connect with that perfect person for them.  The one that looks past all of the physical unattractive qualities to find the inner beauty.  It is sad as hell.  Doesn\u2019t make it false.  It just means we have to make our best life and find ways to be happy and healthy even if we are single.  Build a group of quality friends and share laughter and love with those around us.\n\nThe bowl is grueling and will absolutely hurt people\u2019s sense of self worth and self esteem.  There are too many people not emotionally strong enough in the bowl.  There will be lasting negative effects on both men and women.  That is my point.  \n\nI\u2019m not a gate keeper of the bowl.

You keep saying that math matters yet you\u2019re only basing your \u201cdata\u201d from SA. And in your area at that. A website that was the same kind of trash when I entered the bowl over ten years ago. \n\nI\u2019ve seen ALL kinds of women make it in the bowl for years. Of course it may be harder for someone who isn\u2019t your definition of pretty to find an arrangement but it\u2019s definitely not impossible. You seem more outraged that a person would even try to enter the bowl just because you don\u2019t find them to be pretty. Which is crazy to me. \n\nThe majority of the comments I\u2019m seeing that agree with OP are basically saying ugly and average looking people should not be in the bowl. Period. That\u2019s creating false hope. \n\nI\u2019m not naive. Of course you see some profiles and it\u2019s like alright now. You saw someone on a social media platform claim they make a shit ton of money and this is how they did it. Boom. An influx of girls who have absolutely no idea what they\u2019re doing make profiles. That shit will never go anywhere beyond reasons of \u201cthey\u2019re ugly\u201d. \n\nSA has been an absolute shit show with the quality of men on there. Unattractive and not as rich as they think they are. You know what I did? I didn\u2019t make a post bashing the men because they\u2019re unattractive or can\u2019t provide enough. I just moved on to the next best way of finding someone for a potential arrangement. \n\nIf you\u2019re basing your entire experience off of SA then that tells me everything I need to know lol. \n\nGenuinely curious. How long have you been in the bowl as a SD? What do you look like? What are you bringing to the table in an arrangement?\n\nMan I wish the tumblr sugar pages were a thing still.

Scouting the next one now.\n\nSA is trash but it is also the best source of raw data due to its size and scope.\n\nI\u2019m not conventionally attractive either.  Fortunately I am over 6ft, stocky dad bod, have a fairly interesting life, single, and fairly wealthy. \n\nI offer money. mentorship. and real connection.  My first SB went from working shit retail jobs at $10/hr to a high tech career making $80k a year in -4yrs.  What I helped teach her will make her a millionaire in her own time from her own hard work.  I helped her get off terrible anti anxiety meds and grow a sustainable life for herself.  I could not be more proud of her.  \n\nThe reality is there are men and women whom will never really connect with that perfect person for them.  The one that looks past all of the physical unattractive qualities to find the inner beauty.  It is sad as hell.  Doesn\u2019t make it false.  It just means we have to make our best life and find ways to be happy and healthy even if we are single.  Build a group of quality friends and share laughter and love with those around us.\n\nThe bowl is grueling and will absolutely hurt people\u2019s sense of self worth and self esteem.  There are too many people not emotionally strong enough in the bowl.  There will be lasting negative effects on both men and women.  That is my point.  \n\nI\u2019m not a gate keeper of the bowl.

Scouting the next one now.\n\nSA is trash but it is also the best source of raw data due to its size and scope.\n\nI\u2019m not conventionally attractive either.  Fortunately I am over 6ft, stocky dad bod, have a fairly interesting life, single, and fairly wealthy. \n\nI offer money. mentorship. and real connection.  My first SB went from working shit retail jobs at $10/hr to a high tech career making $80k a year in -4yrs.  What I helped teach her will make her a millionaire in her own time from her own hard work.  I helped her get off terrible anti anxiety meds and grow a sustainable life for herself.  I could not be more proud of her.  \n\nThe reality is there are men and women whom will never really connect with that perfect person for them.  The one that looks past all of the physical unattractive qualities to find the inner beauty.  It is sad as hell.  Doesn\u2019t make it false.  It just means we have to make our best life and find ways to be happy and healthy even if we are single.  Build a group of quality friends and share laughter and love with those around us.\n\nThe bowl is grueling and will absolutely hurt people\u2019s sense of self worth and self esteem.  There are too many people not emotionally strong enough in the bowl.  There will be lasting negative effects on both men and women.  That is my point.  \n\nI\u2019m not a gate keeper of the bowl.  I just want the honest reality to be put on the table and let the participants decide.",
