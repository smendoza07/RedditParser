He seemed REALLY upset with the fact that he couldn't protect Naruto or Sakura. I dont think he'd feel that so strongly if he didn't love Naruto",

In the 5KS (his lowest point in the whole series) he wanted to stop and listen to what Naruto had to say and obeyed his promise of not attacking the village or any Leaf ninja. \n\nNaruto's basically Sasuke's most important person (with the exception of Itachi) in the whole series.",
