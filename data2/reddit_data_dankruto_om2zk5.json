Also I just realized he could never be considered Non binary in the canon of Naruto. Hes been referred to in every form, regardless of gender as a male, not to mention Maru at the end of his name. Plus it wouldnt be really cohesive if they added a non binary character considering gender doesnt play any significant role in the show, I mean hell look at Haku, even then it didnt play a prominent role so itd be kinda forced if they came out and said a character was a certain gender identity, luckily anime is probably the best medium for things like that only cause of the diversity in anime.",

It would be pandering at this point and would make a lot of drama over things that have come and past. A lot of people refer to Haku as she now. At the time Haku was written, being trans was still not widely accepted and would have caused a lot of drama for writers, artists, etc. Or Haku was made without a firm understanding of what the trans experience is like. Hell, I didn\u2019t know what transgender meant until I was 26 and came out as trans.\n\nAs far as Orochimaru, they could be non-binary or even genderfluid. But again, making that announcement would mean nothing to the current story since gender has no matter in the main story. Would be head canon at best.",

I feel like Haku wasnt written to be trans and it was more to do with the custom that men do crossdress in that culture quite a bit. Trans people in asian culture are actually not uncommon, even back then, so that's why I say that. Me personally I've always heard about trans people, the only thing that was new to me was non binary and the tons and tons of sexualities and genders, for me atleast I always thought there were just 3 of each, Gay, Straight, Bi, and Man, Woman, and Both, I've never seen the distinction between the genders like most people, only cause I grew up in a home with an equal amount of men and women so I kinda became both, I am naturally born a woman and actually have a kid on the way but I've always considered myself Androgynous due to the fact people mistake me for a man a lot. Also congrats on finding yourself, it's hard when you get to certain ages, I personally struggled with it until I was 25, now I live my own truth. \n\nI mean it definitely will just stay headcanon, hopefully, I dont want them to do what Spongebob and other shows do and just force inclusion just to seem progressive, honestly for me its offensive, like they tried to say Spongebob was Asexual when sex has nothing to do with the show and the reason I found it offensive is cause I wish a show would have a character that was Asexual cause I am, but at the same time it has to be in the right show and not a kids show. That's one of the problems i had with Steven Universe, everything seemed so forced and it became offensive and full of stereotypes.",

Trans or not, I still appreciate their character A LOT. I like how Kishimoto handled Haku and Zabuza\u2019s relationship for the time. And yes, their culture has been accepting of trans people and gender non-confirming people for some time.\n\nThank you, it was a journey for sure. I\u2019m happy for you too! Love yourself and congrats on your future! \n\nI did not know the term \u201ctransgender\u201d until I googled my thoughts at 26. Have been out as myself since 2017. \n\nAnd I agree that a lot of these thoughts, concepts, and ideas are head canon. Reasons: it\u2019s been a long time since the character intros, the story does not focus on character gender, and it would be out of left field at this point. \n\nI understand the concepts of inclusion and representation, BUT filling in the gap after the fact tends to feel forced for corporate reasons. \n\n\u201cPeople are allowed to be gay now. Lets tell people our character is gay so we can capitalize on that!\u201d \n\nShows that introduce a character as LGBTQI+ from the start are valid AF because they risked their money and popularity for representation. \n\nAt this point, making Haku or Orichimaru trans would feel like pandering for a quick buck.\n\nEdit: grammar/spelling",

I honestly dont see how trap could be offensive, or atleast in the terms of what a trap in anime is, then again people can make hate out of anything. For anime atleast traps are males or are males and nothing else intentionally dressing as women to seduce other men, hence the name, then again I can see how that could be used as a slur towards trans women, however I think it's more of intent. It sucks that people are like that, to me femboy is just a feminine guy, not intentionally but just built that way. I dont think the terms have changed, but I think bad people are using a term that wasmt meant for hate as one that is hateful. Which sucks. History repeating itself again I guess. \n\nThe only reason I still stick by saying Haku is a trap rather than a femboy is cause of the original meaning behind the words and cause Haku quite literally uses looking and dressing feminine as a trap in the show. Just an explanation why I would use that term rather than femboy. I also loved how kishimoto handled their relationship as well, Zabuza crying over Haku is still the saddest thing I've ever seen! Did you know about the plays that were played by men dressed up as women doing even romance scenes back in the day in Japan and China? I always thought they were cool, my great grandma used to tell me about how her great grandfather used to be an actor in them and I always thought it was a really cool part of my family. \n\nThat's soooo awesome! I'm so happy for you! I'm glad you finally became your true self and took that leap, I know it's hard and I know you are strong by going through that. And thank you, I used to have a hard time with my gender due to people thinking I was a man all the time and for a while I thought I was trans but I honestly still wanted to be a woman as well so I decided to look back and think about things in my life that I always loved the image of and the thing that I kept coming back to was being in church when I was younger and seeing the angels presented as Androgynous, I always used to think they were beautiful and I wanted to be like them, eventually I realized I was that all along and it was hard coming out to my parents as Bisexual and Androgynous cause we lived in the south of the United states and they are super religious there, my mom disowned me and actually tried to hurt me but my dad stopped her and told her he wouldnt let her hurt me and he actually accepted me and supported me in life as who I am truly. My dad is one of my best friends cause he always has protected me from people trying to hurt me where I used to live. \n\nI'm so glad someone agrees with me, most people I talk to a out that subject just get aggressive and tell me I'm homophobic for some reason just cause it seems so forced when they do that in tv shows long after the character is established. It definitely feels like they are trying to cash in like they do when they start selling tons of rainbow coloured pride merch, like Van's for instance, this year they sold a shoe that they had previously sold regularly, but the only difference was that it was pride month and they bumped up the price after they brought the shoe back, it was a black shoe with a rainbow and they sold it years ago but this pride month they sold it for twice as much even though the original shoe had nothing to do with pride. It was so disgusting.\n\nOh definitely, like Grell from Black Butler (I know that's kind of a stretch considering they are reapers and a demon) cause he definitely wanted to get with Sebastian and I think that's awesome! Cause they went the extra mile by making it VERY apparent that he was gay. \n\nIt definitely would and honestly I'm for inclusion but that would just be offensive.",

Also I just realized he could never be considered Non binary in the canon of Naruto. Hes been referred to in every form, regardless of gender as a male, not to mention Maru at the end of his name. Plus it wouldnt be really cohesive if they added a non binary character considering gender doesnt play any significant role in the show, I mean hell look at Haku, even then it didnt play a prominent role so itd be kinda forced if they came out and said a character was a certain gender identity, luckily anime is probably the best medium for things like that only cause of the diversity in anime.",

I feel like Haku wasnt written to be trans and it was more to do with the custom that men do crossdress in that culture quite a bit. Trans people in asian culture are actually not uncommon, even back then, so that's why I say that. Me personally I've always heard about trans people, the only thing that was new to me was non binary and the tons and tons of sexualities and genders, for me atleast I always thought there were just 3 of each, Gay, Straight, Bi, and Man, Woman, and Both, I've never seen the distinction between the genders like most people, only cause I grew up in a home with an equal amount of men and women so I kinda became both, I am naturally born a woman and actually have a kid on the way but I've always considered myself Androgynous due to the fact people mistake me for a man a lot. Also congrats on finding yourself, it's hard when you get to certain ages, I personally struggled with it until I was 25, now I live my own truth. \n\nI mean it definitely will just stay headcanon, hopefully, I dont want them to do what Spongebob and other shows do and just force inclusion just to seem progressive, honestly for me its offensive, like they tried to say Spongebob was Asexual when sex has nothing to do with the show and the reason I found it offensive is cause I wish a show would have a character that was Asexual cause I am, but at the same time it has to be in the right show and not a kids show. That's one of the problems i had with Steven Universe, everything seemed so forced and it became offensive and full of stereotypes.",

Trans or not, I still appreciate their character A LOT. I like how Kishimoto handled Haku and Zabuza\u2019s relationship for the time. And yes, their culture has been accepting of trans people and gender non-confirming people for some time.\n\nThank you, it was a journey for sure. I\u2019m happy for you too!

Have been out as myself since 2017. \n\nAnd I agree that a lot of these thoughts, concepts, and ideas are head canon. Reasons: it\u2019s been a long time since the character intros, the story does not focus on character gender, and it would be out of left field at this point. \n\nI understand the concepts of inclusion and representation, BUT filling in the gap after the fact tends to feel forced for corporate reasons. \n\n\u201cPeople are allowed to be gay now. Lets tell people our character is gay so we can capitalize on that!\u201d \n\nShows that introduce a character as LGBTQI+ from the start are valid AF because they risked their money and popularity for representation. \n\nAt this point, making Haku or Orichimaru trans would feel like pandering for a quick buck.\n\nEdit: grammar/spelling",

I honestly dont see how trap could be offensive, or atleast in the terms of what a trap in anime is, then again people can make hate out of anything. For anime atleast traps are males or are males and nothing else intentionally dressing as women to seduce other men, hence the name, then again I can see how that could be used as a slur towards trans women, however I think it's more of intent. It sucks that people are like that, to me femboy is just a feminine guy, not intentionally but just built that way. I dont think the terms have changed, but I think bad people are using a term that wasmt meant for hate as one that is hateful. Which sucks. History repeating itself again I guess. \n\nThe only reason I still stick by saying Haku is a trap rather than a femboy is cause of the original meaning behind the words and cause Haku quite literally uses looking and dressing feminine as a trap in the show. Just an explanation why I would use that term rather than femboy. I also loved how kishimoto handled their relationship as well, Zabuza crying over Haku is still the saddest thing I've ever seen! Did you know about the plays that were played by men dressed up as women doing even romance scenes back in the day in Japan and China? I always thought they were cool, my great grandma used to tell me about how her great grandfather used to be an actor in them and I always thought it was a really cool part of my family. \n\nThat's soooo awesome! I'm so happy for you! I'm glad you finally became your true self and took that leap, I know it's hard and I know you are strong by going through that. And thank you, I used to have a hard time with my gender due to people thinking I was a man all the time and for a while I thought I was trans but I honestly still wanted to be a woman as well so I decided to look back and think about things in my life that I always loved the image of and the thing that I kept coming back to was being in church when I was younger and seeing the angels presented as Androgynous, I always used to think they were beautiful and I wanted to be like them, eventually I realized I was that all along and it was hard coming out to my parents as Bisexual and Androgynous cause we lived in the south of the United states and they are super religious there, my mom disowned me and actually tried to hurt me but my dad stopped her and told her he wouldnt let her hurt me and he actually accepted me and supported me in life as who I am truly. My dad is one of my best friends cause he always has protected me from people trying to hurt me where I used to live. \n\nI'm so glad someone agrees with me, most people I talk to a out that subject just get aggressive and tell me I'm homophobic for some reason just cause it seems so forced when they do that in tv shows long after the character is established. It definitely feels like they are trying to cash in like they do when they start selling tons of rainbow coloured pride merch, like Van's for instance, this year they sold a shoe that they had previously sold regularly, but the only difference was that it was pride month and they bumped up the price after they brought the shoe back, it was a black shoe with a rainbow and they sold it years ago but this pride month they sold it for twice as much even though the original shoe had nothing to do with pride. It was so disgusting.\n\nOh definitely, like Grell from Black Butler (I know that's kind of a stretch considering they are reapers and a demon) cause he definitely wanted to get with Sebastian and I think that's awesome!

Also I just realized he could never be considered Non binary in the canon of Naruto. Hes been referred to in every form, regardless of gender as a male, not to mention Maru at the end of his name. Plus it wouldnt be really cohesive if they added a non binary character considering gender doesnt play any significant role in the show, I mean hell look at Haku, even then it didnt play a prominent role so itd be kinda forced if they came out and said a character was a certain gender identity, luckily anime is probably the best medium for things like that only cause of the diversity in anime.",

I feel like Haku wasnt written to be trans and it was more to do with the custom that men do crossdress in that culture quite a bit. Trans people in asian culture are actually not uncommon, even back then, so that's why I say that. Me personally I've always heard about trans people, the only thing that was new to me was non binary and the tons and tons of sexualities and genders, for me atleast I always thought there were just 3 of each, Gay, Straight, Bi, and Man, Woman, and Both, I've never seen the distinction between the genders like most people, only cause I grew up in a home with an equal amount of men and women so I kinda became both, I am naturally born a woman and actually have a kid on the way but I've always considered myself Androgynous due to the fact people mistake me for a man a lot. Also congrats on finding yourself, it's hard when you get to certain ages, I personally struggled with it until I was 25, now I live my own truth. \n\nI mean it definitely will just stay headcanon, hopefully, I dont want them to do what Spongebob and other shows do and just force inclusion just to seem progressive, honestly for me its offensive, like they tried to say Spongebob was Asexual when sex has nothing to do with the show and the reason I found it offensive is cause I wish a show would have a character that was Asexual cause I am, but at the same time it has to be in the right show and not a kids show. That's one of the problems i had with Steven Universe, everything seemed so forced and it became offensive and full of stereotypes.",

Trans or not, I still appreciate their character A LOT. I like how Kishimoto handled Haku and Zabuza\u2019s relationship for the time. And yes, their culture has been accepting of trans people and gender non-confirming people for some time.\n\nThank you, it was a journey for sure. I\u2019m happy for you too! Love yourself and congrats on your future! \n\nI did not know the term \u201ctransgender\u201d until I googled my thoughts at 26. Have been out as myself since 2017. \n\nAnd I agree that a lot of these thoughts, concepts, and ideas are head canon. Reasons: it\u2019s been a long time since the character intros, the story does not focus on character gender, and it would be out of left field at this point. \n\nI understand the concepts of inclusion and representation, BUT filling in the gap after the fact tends to feel forced for corporate reasons. \n\n\u201cPeople are allowed to be gay now. Lets tell people our character is gay so we can capitalize on that!\u201d \n\nShows that introduce a character as LGBTQI+ from the start are valid AF because they risked their money and popularity for representation. \n\nAt this point, making Haku or Orichimaru trans would feel like pandering for a quick buck.\n\nEdit: grammar/spelling",

I honestly dont see how trap could be offensive, or atleast in the terms of what a trap in anime is, then again people can make hate out of anything. For anime atleast traps are males or are males and nothing else intentionally dressing as women to seduce other men, hence the name, then again I can see how that could be used as a slur towards trans women, however I think it's more of intent. It sucks that people are like that, to me femboy is just a feminine guy, not intentionally but just built that way. I dont think the terms have changed, but I think bad people are using a term that wasmt meant for hate as one that is hateful. Which sucks. History repeating itself again I guess. \n\nThe only reason I still stick by saying Haku is a trap rather than a femboy is cause of the original meaning behind the words and cause Haku quite literally uses looking and dressing feminine as a trap in the show. Just an explanation why I would use that term rather than femboy. I also loved how kishimoto handled their relationship as well, Zabuza crying over Haku is still the saddest thing I've ever seen! Did you know about the plays that were played by men dressed up as women doing even romance scenes back in the day in Japan and China? I always thought they were cool, my great grandma used to tell me about how her great grandfather used to be an actor in them and I always thought it was a really cool part of my family. \n\nThat's soooo awesome! I'm so happy for you! I'm glad you finally became your true self and took that leap, I know it's hard and I know you are strong by going through that. And thank you, I used to have a hard time with my gender due to people thinking I was a man all the time and for a while I thought I was trans but I honestly still wanted to be a woman as well so I decided to look back and think about things in my life that I always loved the image of and the thing that I kept coming back to was being in church when I was younger and seeing the angels presented as Androgynous, I always used to think they were beautiful and I wanted to be like them, eventually I realized I was that all along and it was hard coming out to my parents as Bisexual and Androgynous cause we lived in the south of the United states and they are super religious there, my mom disowned me and actually tried to hurt me but my dad stopped her and told her he wouldnt let her hurt me and he actually accepted me and supported me in life as who I am truly. My dad is one of my best friends cause he always has protected me from people trying to hurt me where I used to live. \n\nI'm so glad someone agrees with me, most people I talk to a out that subject just get aggressive and tell me I'm homophobic for some reason just cause it seems so forced when they do that in tv shows long after the character is established. It definitely feels like they are trying to cash in like they do when they start selling tons of rainbow coloured pride merch, like Van's for instance, this year they sold a shoe that they had previously sold regularly, but the only difference was that it was pride month and they bumped up the price after they brought the shoe back, it was a black shoe with a rainbow and they sold it years ago but this pride month they sold it for twice as much even though the original shoe had nothing to do with pride. It was so disgusting.\n\nOh definitely, like Grell from Black Butler (I know that's kind of a stretch considering they are reapers and a demon) cause he definitely wanted to get with Sebastian and I think that's awesome! Cause they went the extra mile by making it VERY apparent that he was gay. \n\nIt definitely would and honestly I'm for inclusion but that would just be offensive.",

Also I just realized he could never be considered Non binary in the canon of Naruto. Hes been referred to in every form, regardless of gender as a male, not to mention Maru at the end of his name. Plus it wouldnt be really cohesive if they added a non binary character considering gender doesnt play any significant role in the show, I mean hell look at Haku, even then it didnt play a prominent role so itd be kinda forced if they came out and said a character was a certain gender identity, luckily anime is probably the best medium for things like that only cause of the diversity in anime.",

A lot of people refer to Haku as she now. At the time Haku was written, being trans was still not widely accepted and would have caused a lot of drama for writers, artists, etc. Or Haku was made without a firm understanding of what the trans experience is like. Hell, I didn\u2019t know what transgender meant until I was 26 and came out as trans.\n\nAs far as Orochimaru, they could be non-binary or even genderfluid. But again, making that announcement would mean nothing to the current story since gender has no matter in the main story. Would be head canon at best.",

I feel like Haku wasnt written to be trans and it was more to do with the custom that men do crossdress in that culture quite a bit. Trans people in asian culture are actually not uncommon, even back then, so that's why I say that. Me personally I've always heard about trans people, the only thing that was new to me was non binary and the tons and tons of sexualities and genders, for me atleast I always thought there were just 3 of each, Gay, Straight, Bi, and Man, Woman, and Both, I've never seen the distinction between the genders like most people, only cause I grew up in a home with an equal amount of men and women so I kinda became both, I am naturally born a woman and actually have a kid on the way but I've always considered myself Androgynous due to the fact people mistake me for a man a lot. Also congrats on finding yourself, it's hard when you get to certain ages, I personally struggled with it until I was 25, now I live my own truth. \n\nI mean it definitely will just stay headcanon, hopefully, I dont want them to do what Spongebob and other shows do and just force inclusion just to seem progressive, honestly for me its offensive, like they tried to say Spongebob was Asexual when sex has nothing to do with the show and the reason I found it offensive is cause I wish a show would have a character that was Asexual cause I am, but at the same time it has to be in the right show and not a kids show. That's one of the problems i had with Steven Universe, everything seemed so forced and it became offensive and full of stereotypes.",

Trans or not, I still appreciate their character A LOT. I like how Kishimoto handled Haku and Zabuza\u2019s relationship for the time. And yes, their culture has been accepting of trans people and gender non-confirming people for some time.\n\nThank you, it was a journey for sure. I\u2019m happy for you too! Love yourself and congrats on your future! \n\nI did not know the term \u201ctransgender\u201d until I googled my thoughts at 26. Have been out as myself since 2017. \n\nAnd I agree that a lot of these thoughts, concepts, and ideas are head canon. Reasons: it\u2019s been a long time since the character intros, the story does not focus on character gender, and it would be out of left field at this point. \n\nI understand the concepts of inclusion and representation, BUT filling in the gap after the fact tends to feel forced for corporate reasons. \n\n\u201cPeople are allowed to be gay now. Lets tell people our character is gay so we can capitalize on that!\u201d \n\nShows that introduce a character as LGBTQI+ from the start are valid AF because they risked their money and popularity for representation. \n\nAt this point, making Haku or Orichimaru trans would feel like pandering for a quick buck.\n\nEdit: grammar/spelling",

I honestly dont see how trap could be offensive, or atleast in the terms of what a trap in anime is, then again people can make hate out of anything. For anime atleast traps are males or are males and nothing else intentionally dressing as women to seduce other men, hence the name, then again I can see how that could be used as a slur towards trans women, however I think it's more of intent. It sucks that people are like that, to me femboy is just a feminine guy, not intentionally but just built that way. I dont think the terms have changed, but I think bad people are using a term that wasmt meant for hate as one that is hateful. Which sucks. History repeating itself again I guess. \n\nThe only reason I still stick by saying Haku is a trap rather than a femboy is cause of the original meaning behind the words and cause Haku quite literally uses looking and dressing feminine as a trap in the show. Just an explanation why I would use that term rather than femboy. I also loved how kishimoto handled their relationship as well, Zabuza crying over Haku is still the saddest thing I've ever seen! Did you know about the plays that were played by men dressed up as women doing even romance scenes back in the day in Japan and China? I always thought they were cool, my great grandma used to tell me about how her great grandfather used to be an actor in them and I always thought it was a really cool part of my family. \n\nThat's soooo awesome! I'm so happy for you! I'm glad you finally became your true self and took that leap, I know it's hard and I know you are strong by going through that. And thank you, I used to have a hard time with my gender due to people thinking I was a man all the time and for a while I thought I was trans but I honestly still wanted to be a woman as well so I decided to look back and think about things in my life that I always loved the image of and the thing that I kept coming back to was being in church when I was younger and seeing the angels presented as Androgynous, I always used to think they were beautiful and I wanted to be like them, eventually I realized I was that all along and it was hard coming out to my parents as Bisexual and Androgynous cause we lived in the south of the United states and they are super religious there, my mom disowned me and actually tried to hurt me but my dad stopped her and told her he wouldnt let her hurt me and he actually accepted me and supported me in life as who I am truly. My dad is one of my best friends cause he always has protected me from people trying to hurt me where I used to live. \n\nI'm so glad someone agrees with me, most people I talk to a out that subject just get aggressive and tell me I'm homophobic for some reason just cause it seems so forced when they do that in tv shows long after the character is established. It definitely feels like they are trying to cash in like they do when they start selling tons of rainbow coloured pride merch, like Van's for instance, this year they sold a shoe that they had previously sold regularly, but the only difference was that it was pride month and they bumped up the price after they brought the shoe back, it was a black shoe with a rainbow and they sold it years ago but this pride month they sold it for twice as much even though the original shoe had nothing to do with pride. It was so disgusting.\n\nOh definitely, like Grell from Black Butler (I know that's kind of a stretch considering they are reapers and a demon) cause he definitely wanted to get with Sebastian and I think that's awesome! Cause they went the extra mile by making it VERY apparent that he was gay. \n\nIt definitely would and honestly I'm for inclusion but that would just be offensive.",

Also I just realized he could never be considered Non binary in the canon of Naruto. Hes been referred to in every form, regardless of gender as a male, not to mention Maru at the end of his name. Plus it wouldnt be really cohesive if they added a non binary character considering gender doesnt play any significant role in the show, I mean hell look at Haku, even then it didnt play a prominent role so itd be kinda forced if they came out and said a character was a certain gender identity, luckily anime is probably the best medium for things like that only cause of the diversity in anime.",

Hell, I didn\u2019t know what transgender meant until I was 26 and came out as trans.\n\nAs far as Orochimaru, they could be non-binary or even genderfluid.

I feel like Haku wasnt written to be trans and it was more to do with the custom that men do crossdress in that culture quite a bit. Trans people in asian culture are actually not uncommon, even back then, so that's why I say that. Me personally I've always heard about trans people, the only thing that was new to me was non binary and the tons and tons of sexualities and genders, for me atleast I always thought there were just 3 of each, Gay, Straight, Bi, and Man, Woman, and Both, I've never seen the distinction between the genders like most people, only cause I grew up in a home with an equal amount of men and women so I kinda became both, I am naturally born a woman and actually have a kid on the way but I've always considered myself Androgynous due to the fact people mistake me for a man a lot. Also congrats on finding yourself, it's hard when you get to certain ages, I personally struggled with it until I was 25, now I live my own truth. \n\nI mean it definitely will just stay headcanon, hopefully, I dont want them to do what Spongebob and other shows do and just force inclusion just to seem progressive, honestly for me its offensive, like they tried to say Spongebob was Asexual when sex has nothing to do with the show and the reason I found it offensive is cause I wish a show would have a character that was Asexual cause I am, but at the same time it has to be in the right show and not a kids show. That's one of the problems i had with Steven Universe, everything seemed so forced and it became offensive and full of stereotypes.",

It was being used against trans women. I\u2019m not chastising you because I learned it recently too. Times and terms change everyday. \n\nI agree with you that Haku could be a femboy as well. Trans or not, I still appreciate their character A LOT. I like how Kishimoto handled Haku and Zabuza\u2019s relationship for the time. And yes, their culture has been accepting of trans people and gender non-confirming people for some time.\n\nThank you, it was a journey for sure. I\u2019m happy for you too!

Have been out as myself since 2017. \n\nAnd I agree that a lot of these thoughts, concepts, and ideas are head canon. Reasons: it\u2019s been a long time since the character intros, the story does not focus on character gender, and it would be out of left field at this point. \n\nI understand the concepts of inclusion and representation, BUT filling in the gap after the fact tends to feel forced for corporate reasons. \n\n\u201cPeople are allowed to be gay now. Lets tell people our character is gay so we can capitalize on that!\u201d \n\nShows that introduce a character as LGBTQI+ from the start are valid AF because they risked their money and popularity for representation. \n\nAt this point, making Haku or Orichimaru trans would feel like pandering for a quick buck.\n\nEdit: grammar/spelling",

I honestly dont see how trap could be offensive, or atleast in the terms of what a trap in anime is, then again people can make hate out of anything. For anime atleast traps are males or are males and nothing else intentionally dressing as women to seduce other men, hence the name, then again I can see how that could be used as a slur towards trans women, however I think it's more of intent. It sucks that people are like that, to me femboy is just a feminine guy, not intentionally but just built that way. I dont think the terms have changed, but I think bad people are using a term that wasmt meant for hate as one that is hateful. Which sucks. History repeating itself again I guess. \n\nThe only reason I still stick by saying Haku is a trap rather than a femboy is cause of the original meaning behind the words and cause Haku quite literally uses looking and dressing feminine as a trap in the show. Just an explanation why I would use that term rather than femboy. I also loved how kishimoto handled their relationship as well, Zabuza crying over Haku is still the saddest thing I've ever seen! Did you know about the plays that were played by men dressed up as women doing even romance scenes back in the day in Japan and China? I always thought they were cool, my great grandma used to tell me about how her great grandfather used to be an actor in them and I always thought it was a really cool part of my family. \n\nThat's soooo awesome! I'm so happy for you! I'm glad you finally became your true self and took that leap, I know it's hard and I know you are strong by going through that. And thank you, I used to have a hard time with my gender due to people thinking I was a man all the time and for a while I thought I was trans but I honestly still wanted to be a woman as well so I decided to look back and think about things in my life that I always loved the image of and the thing that I kept coming back to was being in church when I was younger and seeing the angels presented as Androgynous, I always used to think they were beautiful and I wanted to be like them, eventually I realized I was that all along and it was hard coming out to my parents as Bisexual and Androgynous cause we lived in the south of the United states and they are super religious there, my mom disowned me and actually tried to hurt me but my dad stopped her and told her he wouldnt let her hurt me and he actually accepted me and supported me in life as who I am truly. My dad is one of my best friends cause he always has protected me from people trying to hurt me where I used to live. \n\nI'm so glad someone agrees with me, most people I talk to a out that subject just get aggressive and tell me I'm homophobic for some reason just cause it seems so forced when they do that in tv shows long after the character is established. It definitely feels like they are trying to cash in like they do when they start selling tons of rainbow coloured pride merch, like Van's for instance, this year they sold a shoe that they had previously sold regularly, but the only difference was that it was pride month and they bumped up the price after they brought the shoe back, it was a black shoe with a rainbow and they sold it years ago but this pride month they sold it for twice as much even though the original shoe had nothing to do with pride. It was so disgusting.\n\nOh definitely, like Grell from Black Butler (I know that's kind of a stretch considering they are reapers and a demon) cause he definitely wanted to get with Sebastian and I think that's awesome! Cause they went the extra mile by making it VERY apparent that he was gay. \n\nIt definitely would and honestly I'm for inclusion but that would just be offensive.",

Also I just realized he could never be considered Non binary in the canon of Naruto. Hes been referred to in every form, regardless of gender as a male, not to mention Maru at the end of his name. Plus it wouldnt be really cohesive if they added a non binary character considering gender doesnt play any significant role in the show, I mean hell look at Haku, even then it didnt play a prominent role so itd be kinda forced if they came out and said a character was a certain gender identity, luckily anime is probably the best medium for things like that only cause of the diversity in anime.",

I feel like Haku wasnt written to be trans and it was more to do with the custom that men do crossdress in that culture quite a bit. Trans people in asian culture are actually not uncommon, even back then, so that's why I say that. Me personally I've always heard about trans people, the only thing that was new to me was non binary and the tons and tons of sexualities and genders, for me atleast I always thought there were just 3 of each, Gay, Straight, Bi, and Man, Woman, and Both, I've never seen the distinction between the genders like most people, only cause I grew up in a home with an equal amount of men and women so I kinda became both, I am naturally born a woman and actually have a kid on the way but I've always considered myself Androgynous due to the fact people mistake me for a man a lot. Also congrats on finding yourself, it's hard when you get to certain ages, I personally struggled with it until I was 25, now I live my own truth. \n\nI mean it definitely will just stay headcanon, hopefully, I dont want them to do what Spongebob and other shows do and just force inclusion just to seem progressive, honestly for me its offensive, like they tried to say Spongebob was Asexual when sex has nothing to do with the show and the reason I found it offensive is cause I wish a show would have a character that was Asexual cause I am, but at the same time it has to be in the right show and not a kids show. That's one of the problems i had with Steven Universe, everything seemed so forced and it became offensive and full of stereotypes.",

It was being used against trans women. I\u2019m not chastising you because I learned it recently too. Times and terms change everyday. \n\nI agree with you that Haku could be a femboy as well. Trans or not, I still appreciate their character A LOT. I like how Kishimoto handled Haku and Zabuza\u2019s relationship for the time. And yes, their culture has been accepting of trans people and gender non-confirming people for some time.\n\nThank you, it was a journey for sure. I\u2019m happy for you too! Love yourself and congrats on your future! \n\nI did not know the term \u201ctransgender\u201d until I googled my thoughts at 26. Have been out as myself since 2017. \n\nAnd I agree that a lot of these thoughts, concepts, and ideas are head canon. Reasons: it\u2019s been a long time since the character intros, the story does not focus on character gender, and it would be out of left field at this point. \n\nI understand the concepts of inclusion and representation, BUT filling in the gap after the fact tends to feel forced for corporate reasons. \n\n\u201cPeople are allowed to be gay now. Lets tell people our character is gay so we can capitalize on that!\u201d \n\nShows that introduce a character as LGBTQI+ from the start are valid AF because they risked their money and popularity for representation. \n\nAt this point, making Haku or Orichimaru trans would feel like pandering for a quick buck.\n\nEdit: grammar/spelling",

For anime atleast traps are males or are males and nothing else intentionally dressing as women to seduce other men, hence the name, then again I can see how that could be used as a slur towards trans women, however I think it's more of intent. It sucks that people are like that, to me femboy is just a feminine guy, not intentionally but just built that way. I dont think the terms have changed, but I think bad people are using a term that wasmt meant for hate as one that is hateful. Which sucks. History repeating itself again I guess. \n\nThe only reason I still stick by saying Haku is a trap rather than a femboy is cause of the original meaning behind the words and cause Haku quite literally uses looking and dressing feminine as a trap in the show. Just an explanation why I would use that term rather than femboy. I also loved how kishimoto handled their relationship as well, Zabuza crying over Haku is still the saddest thing I've ever seen! Did you know about the plays that were played by men dressed up as women doing even romance scenes back in the day in Japan and China? I always thought they were cool, my great grandma used to tell me about how her great grandfather used to be an actor in them and I always thought it was a really cool part of my family. \n\nThat's soooo awesome! I'm so happy for you! I'm glad you finally became your true self and took that leap, I know it's hard and I know you are strong by going through that. And thank you, I used to have a hard time with my gender due to people thinking I was a man all the time and for a while I thought I was trans but I honestly still wanted to be a woman as well so I decided to look back and think about things in my life that I always loved the image of and the thing that I kept coming back to was being in church when I was younger and seeing the angels presented as Androgynous, I always used to think they were beautiful and I wanted to be like them, eventually I realized I was that all along and it was hard coming out to my parents as Bisexual and Androgynous cause we lived in the south of the United states and they are super religious there, my mom disowned me and actually tried to hurt me but my dad stopped her and told her he wouldnt let her hurt me and he actually accepted me and supported me in life as who I am truly. My dad is one of my best friends cause he always has protected me from people trying to hurt me where I used to live. \n\nI'm so glad someone agrees with me, most people I talk to a out that subject just get aggressive and tell me I'm homophobic for some reason just cause it seems so forced when they do that in tv shows long after the character is established. It definitely feels like they are trying to cash in like they do when they start selling tons of rainbow coloured pride merch, like Van's for instance, this year they sold a shoe that they had previously sold regularly, but the only difference was that it was pride month and they bumped up the price after they brought the shoe back, it was a black shoe with a rainbow and they sold it years ago but this pride month they sold it for twice as much even though the original shoe had nothing to do with pride. It was so disgusting.\n\nOh definitely, like Grell from Black Butler (I know that's kind of a stretch considering they are reapers and a demon) cause he definitely wanted to get with Sebastian and I think that's awesome! Cause they went the extra mile by making it VERY apparent that he was gay. \n\nIt definitely would and honestly I'm for inclusion but that would just be offensive.",

Also I just realized he could never be considered Non binary in the canon of Naruto. Hes been referred to in every form, regardless of gender as a male, not to mention Maru at the end of his name. Plus it wouldnt be really cohesive if they added a non binary character considering gender doesnt play any significant role in the show, I mean hell look at Haku, even then it didnt play a prominent role so itd be kinda forced if they came out and said a character was a certain gender identity, luckily anime is probably the best medium for things like that only cause of the diversity in anime.",

Hell, I didn\u2019t know what transgender meant until I was 26 and came out as trans.\n\nAs far as Orochimaru, they could be non-binary or even genderfluid.

I feel like Haku wasnt written to be trans and it was more to do with the custom that men do crossdress in that culture quite a bit. Trans people in asian culture are actually not uncommon, even back then, so that's why I say that. Me personally I've always heard about trans people, the only thing that was new to me was non binary and the tons and tons of sexualities and genders, for me atleast I always thought there were just 3 of each, Gay, Straight, Bi, and Man, Woman, and Both, I've never seen the distinction between the genders like most people, only cause I grew up in a home with an equal amount of men and women so I kinda became both, I am naturally born a woman and actually have a kid on the way but I've always considered myself Androgynous due to the fact people mistake me for a man a lot. Also congrats on finding yourself, it's hard when you get to certain ages, I personally struggled with it until I was 25, now I live my own truth. \n\nI mean it definitely will just stay headcanon, hopefully, I dont want them to do what Spongebob and other shows do and just force inclusion just to seem progressive, honestly for me its offensive, like they tried to say Spongebob was Asexual when sex has nothing to do with the show and the reason I found it offensive is cause I wish a show would have a character that was Asexual cause I am, but at the same time it has to be in the right show and not a kids show. That's one of the problems i had with Steven Universe, everything seemed so forced and it became offensive and full of stereotypes.",

It was being used against trans women. I\u2019m not chastising you because I learned it recently too. Times and terms change everyday. \n\nI agree with you that Haku could be a femboy as well. Trans or not, I still appreciate their character A LOT. I like how Kishimoto handled Haku and Zabuza\u2019s relationship for the time. And yes, their culture has been accepting of trans people and gender non-confirming people for some time.\n\nThank you, it was a journey for sure. I\u2019m happy for you too! Love yourself and congrats on your future! \n\nI did not know the term \u201ctransgender\u201d until I googled my thoughts at 26. Have been out as myself since 2017. \n\nAnd I agree that a lot of these thoughts, concepts, and ideas are head canon. Reasons: it\u2019s been a long time since the character intros, the story does not focus on character gender, and it would be out of left field at this point. \n\nI understand the concepts of inclusion and representation, BUT filling in the gap after the fact tends to feel forced for corporate reasons. \n\n\u201cPeople are allowed to be gay now. Lets tell people our character is gay so we can capitalize on that!\u201d \n\nShows that introduce a character as LGBTQI+ from the start are valid AF because they risked their money and popularity for representation. \n\nAt this point, making Haku or Orichimaru trans would feel like pandering for a quick buck.\n\nEdit: grammar/spelling",

I honestly dont see how trap could be offensive, or atleast in the terms of what a trap in anime is, then again people can make hate out of anything. For anime atleast traps are males or are males and nothing else intentionally dressing as women to seduce other men, hence the name, then again I can see how that could be used as a slur towards trans women, however I think it's more of intent. It sucks that people are like that, to me femboy is just a feminine guy, not intentionally but just built that way. I dont think the terms have changed, but I think bad people are using a term that wasmt meant for hate as one that is hateful. Which sucks. History repeating itself again I guess. \n\nThe only reason I still stick by saying Haku is a trap rather than a femboy is cause of the original meaning behind the words and cause Haku quite literally uses looking and dressing feminine as a trap in the show. Just an explanation why I would use that term rather than femboy. I also loved how kishimoto handled their relationship as well, Zabuza crying over Haku is still the saddest thing I've ever seen! Did you know about the plays that were played by men dressed up as women doing even romance scenes back in the day in Japan and China? I always thought they were cool, my great grandma used to tell me about how her great grandfather used to be an actor in them and I always thought it was a really cool part of my family. \n\nThat's soooo awesome! I'm so happy for you! I'm glad you finally became your true self and took that leap, I know it's hard and I know you are strong by going through that. And thank you, I used to have a hard time with my gender due to people thinking I was a man all the time and for a while I thought I was trans but I honestly still wanted to be a woman as well so I decided to look back and think about things in my life that I always loved the image of and the thing that I kept coming back to was being in church when I was younger and seeing the angels presented as Androgynous, I always used to think they were beautiful and I wanted to be like them, eventually I realized I was that all along and it was hard coming out to my parents as Bisexual and Androgynous cause we lived in the south of the United states and they are super religious there, my mom disowned me and actually tried to hurt me but my dad stopped her and told her he wouldnt let her hurt me and he actually accepted me and supported me in life as who I am truly. My dad is one of my best friends cause he always has protected me from people trying to hurt me where I used to live. \n\nI'm so glad someone agrees with me, most people I talk to a out that subject just get aggressive and tell me I'm homophobic for some reason just cause it seems so forced when they do that in tv shows long after the character is established. It definitely feels like they are trying to cash in like they do when they start selling tons of rainbow coloured pride merch, like Van's for instance, this year they sold a shoe that they had previously sold regularly, but the only difference was that it was pride month and they bumped up the price after they brought the shoe back, it was a black shoe with a rainbow and they sold it years ago but this pride month they sold it for twice as much even though the original shoe had nothing to do with pride. It was so disgusting.\n\nOh definitely, like Grell from Black Butler (I know that's kind of a stretch considering they are reapers and a demon) cause he definitely wanted to get with Sebastian and I think that's awesome! Cause they went the extra mile by making it VERY apparent that he was gay. \n\nIt definitely would and honestly I'm for inclusion but that would just be offensive.",

I feel like Haku wasnt written to be trans and it was more to do with the custom that men do crossdress in that culture quite a bit. Trans people in asian culture are actually not uncommon, even back then, so that's why I say that. Me personally I've always heard about trans people, the only thing that was new to me was non binary and the tons and tons of sexualities and genders, for me atleast I always thought there were just 3 of each, Gay, Straight, Bi, and Man, Woman, and Both, I've never seen the distinction between the genders like most people, only cause I grew up in a home with an equal amount of men and women so I kinda became both, I am naturally born a woman and actually have a kid on the way but I've always considered myself Androgynous due to the fact people mistake me for a man a lot. Also congrats on finding yourself, it's hard when you get to certain ages, I personally struggled with it until I was 25, now I live my own truth. \n\nI mean it definitely will just stay headcanon, hopefully, I dont want them to do what Spongebob and other shows do and just force inclusion just to seem progressive, honestly for me its offensive, like they tried to say Spongebob was Asexual when sex has nothing to do with the show and the reason I found it offensive is cause I wish a show would have a character that was Asexual cause I am, but at the same time it has to be in the right show and not a kids show. That's one of the problems i had with Steven Universe, everything seemed so forced and it became offensive and full of stereotypes.",

I honestly dont see how trap could be offensive, or atleast in the terms of what a trap in anime is, then again people can make hate out of anything. For anime atleast traps are males or are males and nothing else intentionally dressing as women to seduce other men, hence the name, then again I can see how that could be used as a slur towards trans women, however I think it's more of intent. It sucks that people are like that, to me femboy is just a feminine guy, not intentionally but just built that way. I dont think the terms have changed, but I think bad people are using a term that wasmt meant for hate as one that is hateful. Which sucks. History repeating itself again I guess. \n\nThe only reason I still stick by saying Haku is a trap rather than a femboy is cause of the original meaning behind the words and cause Haku quite literally uses looking and dressing feminine as a trap in the show. Just an explanation why I would use that term rather than femboy. I also loved how kishimoto handled their relationship as well, Zabuza crying over Haku is still the saddest thing I've ever seen! Did you know about the plays that were played by men dressed up as women doing even romance scenes back in the day in Japan and China? I always thought they were cool, my great grandma used to tell me about how her great grandfather used to be an actor in them and I always thought it was a really cool part of my family. \n\nThat's soooo awesome! I'm so happy for you! I'm glad you finally became your true self and took that leap, I know it's hard and I know you are strong by going through that. And thank you, I used to have a hard time with my gender due to people thinking I was a man all the time and for a while I thought I was trans but I honestly still wanted to be a woman as well so I decided to look back and think about things in my life that I always loved the image of and the thing that I kept coming back to was being in church when I was younger and seeing the angels presented as Androgynous, I always used to think they were beautiful and I wanted to be like them, eventually I realized I was that all along and it was hard coming out to my parents as Bisexual and Androgynous cause we lived in the south of the United states and they are super religious there, my mom disowned me and actually tried to hurt me but my dad stopped her and told her he wouldnt let her hurt me and he actually accepted me and supported me in life as who I am truly. My dad is one of my best friends cause he always has protected me from people trying to hurt me where I used to live. \n\nI'm so glad someone agrees with me, most people I talk to a out that subject just get aggressive and tell me I'm homophobic for some reason just cause it seems so forced when they do that in tv shows long after the character is established. It definitely feels like they are trying to cash in like they do when they start selling tons of rainbow coloured pride merch, like Van's for instance, this year they sold a shoe that they had previously sold regularly, but the only difference was that it was pride month and they bumped up the price after they brought the shoe back, it was a black shoe with a rainbow and they sold it years ago but this pride month they sold it for twice as much even though the original shoe had nothing to do with pride. It was so disgusting.\n\nOh definitely, like Grell from Black Butler (I know that's kind of a stretch considering they are reapers and a demon) cause he definitely wanted to get with Sebastian and I think that's awesome! Cause they went the extra mile by making it VERY apparent that he was gay. \n\nIt definitely would and honestly I'm for inclusion but that would just be offensive.",

And thank you, I used to have a hard time with my gender due to people thinking I was a man all the time and for a while I thought I was trans but I honestly still wanted to be a woman as well so I decided to look back and think about things in my life that I always loved the image of and the thing that I kept coming back to was being in church when I was younger and seeing the angels presented as Androgynous, I always used to think they were beautiful and I wanted to be like them, eventually I realized I was that all along and it was hard coming out to my parents as Bisexual and Androgynous cause we lived in the south of the United states and they are super religious there, my mom disowned me and actually tried to hurt me but my dad stopped her and told her he wouldnt let her hurt me and he actually accepted me and supported me in life as who I am truly. My dad is one of my best friends cause he always has protected me from people trying to hurt me where I used to live. \n\nI'm so glad someone agrees with me, most people I talk to a out that subject just get aggressive and tell me I'm homophobic for some reason just cause it seems so forced when they do that in tv shows long after the character is established. It definitely feels like they are trying to cash in like they do when they start selling tons of rainbow coloured pride merch, like Van's for instance, this year they sold a shoe that they had previously sold regularly, but the only difference was that it was pride month and they bumped up the price after they brought the shoe back, it was a black shoe with a rainbow and they sold it years ago but this pride month they sold it for twice as much even though the original shoe had nothing to do with pride. It was so disgusting.\n\nOh definitely, like Grell from Black Butler (I know that's kind of a stretch considering they are reapers and a demon) cause he definitely wanted to get with Sebastian and I think that's awesome! Cause they went the extra mile by making it VERY apparent that he was gay. \n\nIt definitely would and honestly I'm for inclusion but that would just be offensive.",

Hell, I didn\u2019t know what transgender meant until I was 26 and came out as trans.\n\nAs far as Orochimaru, they could be non-binary or even genderfluid.

I dont think the terms have changed, but I think bad people are using a term that wasmt meant for hate as one that is hateful. Which sucks. History repeating itself again I guess. \n\nThe only reason I still stick by saying Haku is a trap rather than a femboy is cause of the original meaning behind the words and cause Haku quite literally uses looking and dressing feminine as a trap in the show. Just an explanation why I would use that term rather than femboy. I also loved how kishimoto handled their relationship as well, Zabuza crying over Haku is still the saddest thing I've ever seen! Did you know about the plays that were played by men dressed up as women doing even romance scenes back in the day in Japan and China? I always thought they were cool, my great grandma used to tell me about how her great grandfather used to be an actor in them and I always thought it was a really cool part of my family. \n\nThat's soooo awesome! I'm so happy for you! I'm glad you finally became your true self and took that leap, I know it's hard and I know you are strong by going through that. And thank you, I used to have a hard time with my gender due to people thinking I was a man all the time and for a while I thought I was trans but I honestly still wanted to be a woman as well so I decided to look back and think about things in my life that I always loved the image of and the thing that I kept coming back to was being in church when I was younger and seeing the angels presented as Androgynous, I always used to think they were beautiful and I wanted to be like them, eventually I realized I was that all along and it was hard coming out to my parents as Bisexual and Androgynous cause we lived in the south of the United states and they are super religious there, my mom disowned me and actually tried to hurt me but my dad stopped her and told her he wouldnt let her hurt me and he actually accepted me and supported me in life as who I am truly. My dad is one of my best friends cause he always has protected me from people trying to hurt me where I used to live. \n\nI'm so glad someone agrees with me, most people I talk to a out that subject just get aggressive and tell me I'm homophobic for some reason just cause it seems so forced when they do that in tv shows long after the character is established. It definitely feels like they are trying to cash in like they do when they start selling tons of rainbow coloured pride merch, like Van's for instance, this year they sold a shoe that they had previously sold regularly, but the only difference was that it was pride month and they bumped up the price after they brought the shoe back, it was a black shoe with a rainbow and they sold it years ago but this pride month they sold it for twice as much even though the original shoe had nothing to do with pride. It was so disgusting.\n\nOh definitely, like Grell from Black Butler (I know that's kind of a stretch considering they are reapers and a demon) cause he definitely wanted to get with Sebastian and I think that's awesome! Cause they went the extra mile by making it VERY apparent that he was gay. \n\nIt definitely would and honestly I'm for inclusion but that would just be offensive.",
