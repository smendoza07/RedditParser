    "body": "I\u2019m a long time lurker. I see a lot of SBs asking if it\u2019s harder for black SBs and other minorities. I\u2019m on the SD side and black. Not Drake or Obama black....Akon and Jamie Foxx black!\n\nMy experience is as follows:\n\n- Black, Latin, and Mixed babies almost exclusively make the first move with me. My inbox stays flooded with inbound requests from them, 5 to 10 a day, sometimes as high as 20.\n\n- Most range from average to the very hot (and normally out of my league). But there are some very unattractive, out of shape, POTs who seem to think people will literally date anything. It makes me wonder if they are just used to (black) men who have no standards.\n\n- I only have to use the search to do outbound if I\u2019m looking for White, Asian or South East Asian babies. They never reach out (to me) first. The response rate from these groups is very low. I have only managed to get a handful to respond and they just flat out told me they don\u2019t want a black SD. (Not complaining, I could care less, not begging anyone to money from me, lol)\n\n- In other cases they will deflect, ANYTHING I say seems to put them on edge. For instance there have been situations where they\u2019ve objected to my using words like PPM, Allowance, Date, M and G, Arrangement, Sugar...even Hello. Not all at once, different words, different messages, to different people. It\u2019s all bowl language I learned from this forum, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the words themselves. It seems to be defensiveness I can only chalk up to racial perception. \u2018Sugar\u2019 from a \u2018black man\u2019 automatically makes them feel differently about it all than sugar from others. Sugar from me seems to imply \u2018pimp\u2019 or \u2018John\u2019. Sugar from someone else is \u2018oh my god my SD is so generous and wonderful\u2019.\n\n- Let me clarify, this is in the South. On the West Coast all these behavior patterns are obliterated. Anything goes out there. North East is not as different from the South as I\u2019d have expected. I\u2019ve never been in the Midwest long enough to SD, so no information \n\n- I will also do outbound searches to reach out to some of the Black, Latin, and Mixed babies that don\u2019t reach out to me. 50% of these  also seem to be holding out for white guys or they say as much on their profile. (I find this one to be a bit of head scratcher, but same as above.) The other 50% are skeptical that \u2018I\u2019m\u2019 real....in other words they perpetuate a stereotype that probably is pervasive throughout the bowl (that there are no, or few, genuine Black SDs). \n\n- Stereotypes usually have some truth to them, so I get that I may be a black unicorn. But I like sugar relationships. I like them long term and I like to help my SBs with whatever they might need help with.l from bills, to rent, to equinox.\n\n- Every SB I\u2019ve met comments on how rare it is to meet a black SD who is legitimately interested in an ongoing SR.\n\n- At first I thought I was meeting a lot of rinsers, but there\u2019s some interesting social patterns here too. Some SBs seem to want to \u2018test\u2019 my individual wealth by asking for things and favors right away that i presume they wouldn\u2019t get away with others. I call this the \u2018Black Daddy Tax\u2019, paying for a bunch of superfluous bullshit in the first few dates just so they can be sure I\u2019m not pulling a fast one with my tax return money. This stuff above and beyond the allowance, fancy dinners, and hotels but before we\u2019ve had time to settle into a long term arrangement where I\u2019d be fine with any expense.\n\n- While it doesn\u2019t do anything for me, I did sugar once with someone who wanted online-only. She sent me some semi-naughty pics for a few weeks until I told her it wasn\u2019t for me. I wasn\u2019t interested in anything naughtier, the pics were just useless to me. I tried it because a handful of SBs have said that there is this thriving online-only world of SDs and I wanted to see if maybe I was missing out on something.\n\n- I\u2019ve learned that I do not have the privilege of ever doing a low-key M and G in a really casual setting. I made the mistake of asking a first time SB to meet me at a divvy sports bar for a first meet. Usually I only do the best restaurants in the city for a first meet. However, as soon as I said the name of this place she laughed on the phone and hung up. I assume she took the invite as \u2018my idea of wining and dining\u2019 her. I was just pressed for time and the place was close. Coffee shops don\u2019t work either. I\u2019ve done it, but those M and Gs never progress. I\u2019ve decided it\u2019s because it doesn\u2019t pass whatever \u2018wealth test\u2019 that the SB may be consciously or subconsciously measuring me against.\n\n- Also, I know that my friends in the bowl have told me occasionally they get away with \u2018Mentorship\u2019 and \u2018Experiences\u2019 as part of what the SB is seeking from them. Not me. Show them the money or the shopping! These are guys with my same career and friend groups (private equity) so I find that hilarious knowing what they can get away with. Good branding is everything!\n\nDon\u2019t read this as my complaining! But don\u2019t delude yourself into believing the world is the same for Black Daddies either. \n\nEven the name sounds suspect - \u2018Black Daddy\u2019 sounds like he just got out of Rikers for hustling crack. \u2018White Daddy\u2019 sounds like he may have done some federal time but still runs a $400M enterprise that pays no taxes.\n\nI\u2019m just trying to objectively offer what my experience has been in the bowl!\n\nAlso, I\u2019m impressed by how much play my White brethren are getting out here! Maybe one day I will pull an Eddie Murphy and try the bowl in full-on whiteface makeup to get a glimpse of how crazy it can be!",

These same guys complain about escorts and SBs with NBA (No Blacks Allowed) policies. They hurt their own case.  \n\nI also know a few very well off genuine black SDs who treat women very well.  One is an ex NFL player and the women love him.",

In my mind you sound like Joshua Johnson from that NPR show 1A\ud83d\ude02, that's a good thing btw. \n\nI am extremely new to the bowl and feel like your commentary should go under Sugar Tips for just starting out. I'm 30 years old, Black of Carribbean descent, already educated, and I work full-time, just starting out. I position myself as someone particularly nontraditional. I keep an open mind and I move at my own pace in the bowl. \n\nI firmly believe there is someone for everyone. I always look my best and that may not be for everyone. But traditionally a SB evolves with the companionship and support of her SD. So how I start out must be different then my goal. I search for Black SD because I want them to be a part of that evolution, to have a hand in it. Because the black tax goes both ways, the sizing up to see how far you will go and for the least support or influence is felt in this side of things. Why not stop the tax and enjoy each other! \n\nThanks for the insight and I'm rooting for everybody Black\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

A smiling, generous, laid back guy with good looks is always on the list. Akon looks better than Drake, so hey. \n\nSecond is that there is a steady woman (wife or live-in girlfriend) hanging off you and no one wants to fight with her over you, when the news gets out. You will marry her whenever, as you know she will wait, so while she is crying and stalking, you can go out and have your pick of the pretty flowers in the field. \n\nI cannot extend it to all but I have yet to meet a truly single, as in really single, hot black dude with $$$. There was a woman in the midst who was refuting the fact that just because there wasn't a marriage certificate, didn't mean she was his Mrs. \n\nPeople make assumptions of the future based on the past, so some will allow their past experiences to push them to overlook you or seriously doubt you.",

You do seem like a unicorn if your position is true but your counterparts make Black SDs look very bad in the bowl generally. It\u2019s gotten so bad I know many black SBs who wont deal with black SDs because of the past experiences they have constantly had. \n\nBlack SDs are usually not naturally generous, they like to \u201ctest\u201d the product before paying, they are flakey, they are mean, they are easily jaded, they are very cheap, they go on SA not looking for an escort but then talk to SBs like escorts. The list just goes on and on and on. I\u2019ve had a POT Black SD tell me he only provided money on a \u201cas need\u201d basis not ppm or monthly allowance \ud83d\ude11. Another one told me that he was looking to save someone from the \u201csugar life\u201d and that since he wasn\u2019t a wrinkled old white man he didn\u2019t have to \u201cpay for sex\u201d. Lastly I had a black US Senator SD who was a complete flake after hounding me down to give him the time of day. \n\nI say all that to say that your perception is valid but what you maybe experiencing is due to your peers. It\u2019s not your responsibility to fix it but hopefully understanding where it stems from gives you some solace. \n\nBlack Sbs also fave their own issues in the bowl so hopefully you are giving those black SBs that you are attracted to a chance at an arrangement. \ud83d\ude0a",

Genuine ones are  wayyy more difficult to come by. Shoot!! It is difficult to come across a sugar daddy that you mesh with in general regardless of race. Black daddies are like looking for a needle in a big stack of hay.\n\nIf I do see a legit black daddy, I will assume that he is into other races of women so, I don\u2019t even bother. Most of the time, it is implied that he prefers racially ambiguous/ other races of women. It\u2019s easier to find white daddies they seem to be more into black women. At least from my experience. \n\nIf I was in the bowl, the black daddies I would look for would be darker skinned. For some reason, I\u2019m not into light-skinned black men. Lol!",

In general dating with both non-black men and  non- black women.  They only entertain having a black person as a spouse if they are not having luck with other races.  A lot of the time they are low-quality and you can understand why no one wants them.  \n\nIt\u2019s partially our fault, black folks are known for putting people with non-black phenotypes on some sort of pedestal and those people have noticed. This is why they think they can feed us sh*t and call it sugar. \n\nI know all people don\u2019t have this mindset set but, many people do.\n\n\nIt will happen but, the only way to fight it is to call it out and keep your standards high.

I'm 30 years old, Black of Carribbean decent, already educated, and I work full-time, just starting out. I position myself as someone particularly nontraditional. I keep an open mind and I move at my own pace in the bowl. \n\nI firmly believe there is someone for everyone. I always look my best and that may not be for everyone. But traditionally a SB evolves with the companionship and support of her SD. So how I start out must be different then my goal. I search for Black SD because I want them to be a part of that evolution, to have a hand in it. Because the black tax goes both ways, the sizing up to see how far you will go and for the least support or influence is felt in this side of things. Why not so the tax and enjoy each other! \n\nThanks for the insight and I'm rooting for everybody Black\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

I'm about as white as they come in all aspects and get messages from overweight, unnatractive girls.\n\nUnfortunately you will find the midwest to be closer to the south than the west when it comes to race relations. We are very much a mix of south, NE, and West, but in this area we are backwards like the south. It's all quiet and behind the scenes and not horrible, but it exists.

There's a lid for every pot and they probably have to message more people to find someone who is into their thing. There's nothing wrong with a simple intro message to see if you might happen to be into them. I think this is your own insecurity about being black coming out (and I'm sorry we live in a racist world and you have to deal with that) but referring to a human as \"anything\" is gross. In your very next point you talk about shooting your shot with girls who usually don't return the attraction, what if they talked about you this way? Let's all agree there's no harm done with a nice intro message and move on without shaming people.",

Once I got through therapy and wasn't an insecure, shame filled mess suddenly I went from having no dates to having really great relationships w quality men. My physical appearance did not change. I just think you don't have experience with men who aren't you while I do. I also think, it's a harmless hello you can scroll past. I can't get mad about every man on every app that messages me that I'm not interested in. I mean, i could, but my quality of life would be worse for it.",

It\u2019s gotten so bad I know many black SBs who wont deal with black SDs because of the past experiences they have constantly had. \n\nBlack SDs are usually not naturally generous, they like to \u201ctest\u201d the product before paying, they are flakey, they are mean, they are easily jaded, they are very cheap, they go on SA not looking for an escort but then talk to SBs like escorts.

            "body": "Interesting write-up, thanks for posting it!  There are some things there that don't surprise me, e.g., the reprehensible practice of putting racial preferences on profiles, and racial groups you get more or fewer responses from.  I have one black friend who has inconsistently been in the bowl, and he tells me the same things (along with a lot of the other things you experienced, such as his enormous popularity with black POTs, skepticism that he has the $, etc).  There's also a few areas where I'm not sure whether you're just experiencing what we all go through, or are experiencing something different.  3 examples: \n\n>  But there are some very unattractive, out of shape, POTs who seem to think people will literally date anything. \n\nAs far as SBs who contact me first, I'd say an enormous percentage of them (upwards of 80%, maybe) are either escorts, or well below average in looks for the bowl.  It makes sense that that people with fewer options, and people who are professionals, will be hunting more.  \n\n> Some SBs seem to want to \u2018test\u2019 my individual wealth by asking for things and favors right away that i presume they wouldn\u2019t get away with others.  \n\nThis is a pretty universal experience that SDs discuss a lot.   I learned early on that as soon as a POT makes an inappropriate request, even a small one, it's best to just move on completely.  I call it the Hustler Interview -- that first small (but inappropriate, at this phase of relationship) request is to see if you're spineless or naive enough to give in; if you \"pass\" the test, her requests will escalate quickly.   Not saying you might not be getting these \"tests\" more than me, just that there is an element of this happening to all SDs.  The point, maybe, is that it's so common, I have name for it.  That said, for me, it's always clearly a Hustler Interview rather than a wealth test, as best I can tell.\n\n> I\u2019ve learned that I do not have the privilege of ever doing a low-key M and G in a really casual setting. I made the mistake of asking a first time SB to meet me at a divvy sports bar for a first meet. \n\nI don't have much to compare to here, because even though I enjoy dive bars, I've never tried to set up a M&G at one; unless I know in advance she loves dives bars, I think it's a clearly inappropriate place to propose we meet.  Is it possible this was less about privilege, than about you setting up a M&G at an inappropriate venue, and a savvy and confident SB calling you on it?  I've never set up a M&G at a dive because I feel like what happened to you, is exactly what might happen to me.  Being pressed for time and the place was close isn't an excuse -- I either set up the M&G at an appropriate place, or if I can't do that because I'm pressed for time, put the M&G off.  In addition, I no longer do coffee M&Gs at all, because like you, I think they too often don't lead things to progress.  Although for me, the explanation is that coffee is the most contrived, least romantic first meeting place ever, and much harder (at least for me) to make a connection.  It could be we have the same conclusion (coffee M&Gs don't work) for completely different reasons.\n\nAnyway, good stuff, thanks for sharing it",

                    "body": "Thanks for your post. You make a lot of great and valid observations.\n\n1. I tried to be candid and share my whole experience. So you are correct that a lot of it has nothing to do with race.\n\n2. i read through a lot of forum posts that describe 'escort' 'rinser' or 'pro' tendencies and I have to be completely honest it always lines up like 98% of how many of the black POT SBs approach me. So I'm less harsh because it's hard to tell if they are doing that because they are pros or because they are having  a hard time in the bowl. I find that generally black, Latina and mixed SBs can be more aggressive really as a defense mechanism because of how the world treats them elsewhere\n\n3. A dive bar is probably inappropriate. But I know a lot of guys who suggest coffee shops. So I tried it and had poor results. If the first meet is a nice restaurant, there's almost always at least some courting that follows and sometimes that turns into a long term SR. Anyways I was just pointing out the expectional situations, those are not the norm for me. I stick to the nice restaurants",

I actually won't do coffee in my romantic life either.  With both a potential date, and a POT SB, if she digs in and insists on coffee, I always just pass.  Luckily, very few women do this.\n\nNice restaurants definitely work better.  But I also find things a bit formal, you're sitting across the table from each other, etc. My favorite is to find an upscale bar or restaurant/bar for drinks and small plates.  This can still signal (to some extent) wealth and taste to the SB (do you have any idea what a boulevardier costs in a fancy bar??), but in an atmosphere that is already looser and more fun, and when it comes to eating, nothing is more romantic than sitting on the couch next to each other, knees touching, and sharing tapas (or keep more distance if the chemistry isn't there yet).   Anyway, just giving you an idea for another option, since you and I both seem to have the \"no coffee shops\" thing going!",

In general dating with both non-black men and  non- black women.  They only entertain having a black person as a spouse if they are not having luck with other races.  A lot of the time they are low-quality and you can understand why no one wants them.  \n\nIt\u2019s partially our fault, black folks are known for putting people with non-black phenotypes on some sort of pedestal and those people have noticed. This is why they think they can feed us sh*t and call it sugar. \n\nI know all people don\u2019t have this mindset set but, many people do.\n\n\nIt will happen but, the only way to fight it is to call it out and keep your standards high.

I'm super happy you are using your resources to get what you want, but your tastes just aren't everyone's taste. It's not just good-looking couples that are going on dates or having sex.

So you are correct that a lot of it has nothing to do with race.\n\n2. i read through a lot of forum posts that describe 'escort' 'rinser' or 'pro' tendencies and I have to be completely honest it always lines up like 98% of how many of the black POT SBs approach me. So I'm less harsh because it's hard to tell if they are doing that because they are pros or because they are having  a hard time in the bowl. I find that generally black, Latina and mixed SBs can be more aggressive really as a defense mechanism because of how the world treats them elsewhere\n\n3. A dive bar is probably inappropriate. But I know a lot of guys who suggest coffee shops. So I tried it and had poor results. If the first meet is a nice restaurant, there's almost always at least some courting that follows and sometimes that turns into a long term SR. Anyways I was just pointing out the expectional situations, those are not the norm for me. I stick to the nice restaurants",

I actually won't do coffee in my romantic life either.  With both a potential date, and a POT SB, if she digs in and insists on coffee, I always just pass.  Luckily, very few women do this.\n\nNice restaurants definitely work better.  But I also find things a bit formal, you're sitting across the table from each other, etc. My favorite is to find an upscale bar or restaurant/bar for drinks and small plates.  This can still signal (to some extent) wealth and taste to the SB (do you have any idea what a boulevardier costs in a fancy bar??), but in an atmosphere that is already looser and more fun, and when it comes to eating, nothing is more romantic than sitting on the couch next to each other, knees touching, and sharing tapas (or keep more distance if the chemistry isn't there yet).   Anyway, just giving you an idea for another option, since you and I both seem to have the \"no coffee shops\" thing going!",

In general dating with both non-black men and  non- black women.  They only entertain having a black person as a spouse if they are not having luck with other races.  A lot of the time they are low-quality and you can understand why no one wants them.  \n\nIt\u2019s partially our fault, black folks are known for putting people with non-black phenotypes on some sort of pedestal and those people have noticed. This is why they think they can feed us sh*t and call it sugar. \n\nI know all people don\u2019t have this mindset set but, many people do.\n\n\nIt will happen but, the only way to fight it is to call it out and keep your standards high.

I'm super happy you are using your resources to get what you want, but your tastes just aren't everyone's taste. It's not just good-looking couples that are going on dates or having sex.

I just think you don't have experience with men who aren't you while I do. I also think, it's a harmless hello you can scroll past. I can't get mad about every man on every app that messages me that I'm not interested in. I mean, i could, but my quality of life would be worse for it.",

I actually won't do coffee in my romantic life either.  With both a potential date, and a POT SB, if she digs in and insists on coffee, I always just pass.  Luckily, very few women do this.\n\nNice restaurants definitely work better.  But I also find things a bit formal, you're sitting across the table from each other, etc. My favorite is to find an upscale bar or restaurant/bar for drinks and small plates.  This can still signal (to some extent) wealth and taste to the SB (do you have any idea what a boulevardier costs in a fancy bar??), but in an atmosphere that is already looser and more fun, and when it comes to eating, nothing is more romantic than sitting on the couch next to each other, knees touching, and sharing tapas (or keep more distance if the chemistry isn't there yet).   Anyway, just giving you an idea for another option, since you and I both seem to have the \"no coffee shops\" thing going!",

The narrative I have heard about this is that people give up. We are talking about women who are on a dating site actively messaging people. I do think there is a lid for every pot (or at least, the vast majority of pots) and you can find it if you try.  I'm super happy you are using your resources to get what you want, but your tastes just aren't everyone's taste. It's not just good-looking couples that are going on dates or having sex. If these women aren't getting messaged back, they'll get off the platform. It's a problem that takes care of itself and the only think OP is accomplishing by shaming them is trying to shut them down from talking to someone who might be happy to talk to them back.",
