    "body": "I think that rule is really not helpful to the community. Newer SBs need guidance in what to expect as while they may hear a certain amount that some people get, I think it is valuable to discuss that some of the higher amounts aren\u2019t really normal. \n\nIt is simple. Suspend or ban those that allowance shame. Suspend or ban those that call allowances they don\u2019t feel are high enough salt. Taking away the discussion totally is a disservice IMO.",

            "body": "On a purely theoretical, and biased because I'm a SB, level I would love open discussions about PPM/allowance amounts. Like in the workplace, keeping compensation conversations secret only serves to benefit the employer. Transparency allows people to make informed decisions and I strongly believe that if you're so easily swayed as to blow up a SR you're happy in because someone else in your city is getting more, then you shouldn't be a SB anyway. The bowl requires thicker skin than that. And the imbalance of power between SBs and SDs should counsel for rules/norms favoring SBs just to try to even it out. \n\nOn a practical level being a mod is hard. Responding to reports is a lot of work. Dealing with people who are unhappy with how you responded to reports is exhausting. Balancing the needs/demands on SBs and SDs on the sub is impossible. Not to mention Reddit as a whole will shut down SLF if it starts to cross FOSTA/SESTA lines. And the truth is not everyone in the bowl or on this sub is a rational thinker with thick skin - and the posts here do impact the way people engage in their SRs for better or worse. And conflict between users here can and has had real life consequences. So I understand the rule from a practical POV.",

There were a very select few yikes that I saw a guy say a woman was lying about her allowance, but I think most of the time it was just people trying to give advice that the reality of the situation was that you could hold out for that huge allowance, but it wasn\u2019t likely to happen. I remember getting insulted on here when I said my monthly allowance roughly equaled rent/utilities on a nice apartment in my area and was told I was salt because of it by multiple SB\u2019s on here.",

I may pull one amount for my area but one of my friends can pull a lot more because of how she looks. Then you also factor in that depending on personal circumstances you may have allowances all over the place depending on where you are in life and who you are with.

This isn't a job with a set of standards. It's a relationship with 2 people that have wants and needs. It would be tantamount to asking on a public marriage forum.. how much should my husband give me each week as an allowance..? Or asking some friends... how much money should my fianc\u00e9 give me to help me pay my bills.?  \n\n\n>The ONLY correct answer to \"how much should I get\" is: find an amount you are okay with. That's it. Just because SB A gets X, does not mean SB H will get anything higher than Y.\n\nBingo..!",

If an SD wants to offer more then that\u2019s great. If an SD can\u2019t meet my minimum then we simply aren\u2019t a fit for an SR together. I don\u2019t negotiate my minimum as I feel it leaves a bad taste in the mouth. I also feel like it is a fair amount (knowing how I give in an SR). \n\nI think rather than do this back and forth plea for an allowance thread to receive consistent rejection to the idea of bringing it back, why not just think about the amount you need/want? Decide what will make you happy and look for that. Just be reasonable in your expectations of an SR overall.",

Being a mod is thankless work and I get that but it being thankless doesn't excuse you from doing your job\n* Kinda dumb. If there's clear issues maybe don't strive to keep adding numbers to an obviously broken system? It's like working in tech and having an unfinished web app but adding users to it anyway. Yeah, it can probably function (even well in some regards) but eventually the system is going to lag and be difficult to use at an Enterprise level leading everyone to be annoyed that they have to use the legacy system to accomplish things. \"No one has to use SLF\" is not an acceptable response---the best part about SLF is that it isn't an echo chamber and we have a sidebar that is **supposed** to protect everyone. It would be redundant and nonsensical to make the entire forum again and hope people move over to a new platform because the old one's only issue was (what is probably) a few mod diplomacy issues. Especially when there has been an uptick in mod responses to threads like these and overall mod activity (though that happens in q1 regardless) but yet..... y'all want community feedback but aren't going to use it? What in tarnation. \n\nIf you don't want to do your job as a moderator to be impartial and uphold the rules even when you personally don't agree with them, then either vote to change/clarify/restate the rules or step down as mod. If you don't want to do the work to explain to someone how their post is breaking the rules, don't be a mod. It's not that complicated. \n\nI'd rather be a part of a forum that isn't primary a revolving door of newbie accounts with easily answered questions because the veterans are fed up with lazy, but somehow simultaneously power tripping mods. That's how you look when you shrug and say \"I don't care if there's problems, I personally like it this way.\" I think most people feel the same. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

And if a SB messages a SD asking like \"what are you offering?\" I've found most guys are very unwilling to give averages or any info at all. They're hoping us SBs don't know how much to ask for so that basically we undervalue ourselves and they get a deal, or at least that's what I've noticed in my area.

And a few who are disadvantaged.\n\nFor example, in the legal field, lawyers once attempted to prevent other lawyers from advertising fees. Some lawyers benefited from the fact that clients had no easy way to find out if other lawyers would charge a different amount. The information asymmetry benefited a few lawyers, while disadvantaging everyone else. And also made finding a lawyer more difficult and confusing than it needed to be. A lot of people paid more than they needed to. A few made more than they deserved. And a lot of people who could have benefited from a lawyer, didn't hire one at all, because they were afraid of how much it would cost.\n\nIt's no different here. \"Allowance shaming\" is just an attempt to distort the flow of information.

There were a very select few yikes that I saw a guy say a woman was lying about her allowance, but I think most of the time it was just people trying to give advice that the reality of the situation was that you could hold out for that huge allowance, but it wasn\u2019t likely to happen. I remember getting insulted on here when I said my monthly allowance roughly equaled rent/utilities on a nice apartment in my area and was told I was salt because of it by multiple SB\u2019s on here.",

Being a mod is thankless work and I get that but it being thankless doesn't excuse you from doing your job\n* Kinda dumb. If there's clear issues maybe don't strive to keep adding numbers to an obviously broken system? It's like working in tech and having an unfinished web app but adding users to it anyway. Yeah, it can probably function (even well in some regards) but eventually the system is going to lag and be difficult to use at an Enterprise level leading everyone to be annoyed that they have to use the legacy system to accomplish things. \"No one has to use SLF\" is not an acceptable response---the best part about SLF is that it isn't an echo chamber and we have a sidebar that is **supposed** to protect everyone. It would be redundant and nonsensical to make the entire forum again and hope people move over to a new platform because the old one's only issue was (what is probably) a few mod diplomacy issues. Especially when there has been an uptick in mod responses to threads like these and overall mod activity (though that happens in q1 regardless) but yet..... y'all want community feedback but aren't going to use it? What in tarnation. \n\nIf you don't want to do your job as a moderator to be impartial and uphold the rules even when you personally don't agree with them, then either vote to change/clarify/restate the rules or step down as mod. If you don't want to do the work to explain to someone how their post is breaking the rules, don't be a mod. It's not that complicated. \n\nI'd rather be a part of a forum that isn't primary a revolving door of newbie accounts with easily answered questions because the veterans are fed up with lazy, but somehow simultaneously power tripping mods. That's how you look when you shrug and say \"I don't care if there's problems, I personally like it this way.\" I think most people feel the same. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

And if a SB messages a SD asking like \"what are you offering?\" I've found most guys are very unwilling to give averages or any info at all.

There were a very select few yikes that I saw a guy say a woman was lying about her allowance, but I think most of the time it was just people trying to give advice that the reality of the situation was that you could hold out for that huge allowance, but it wasn\u2019t likely to happen.

Being a mod is thankless work and I get that but it being thankless doesn't excuse you from doing your job\n* Kinda dumb. If there's clear issues maybe don't strive to keep adding numbers to an obviously broken system? It's like working in tech and having an unfinished web app but adding users to it anyway. Yeah, it can probably function (even well in some regards) but eventually the system is going to lag and be difficult to use at an Enterprise level leading everyone to be annoyed that they have to use the legacy system to accomplish things. \"No one has to use SLF\" is not an acceptable response---the best part about SLF is that it isn't an echo chamber and we have a sidebar that is **supposed** to protect everyone. It would be redundant and nonsensical to make the entire forum again and hope people move over to a new platform because the old one's only issue was (what is probably) a few mod diplomacy issues. Especially when there has been an uptick in mod responses to threads like these and overall mod activity (though that happens in q1 regardless) but yet..... y'all want community feedback but aren't going to use it? What in tarnation. \n\nIf you don't want to do your job as a moderator to be impartial and uphold the rules even when you personally don't agree with them, then either vote to change/clarify/restate the rules or step down as mod. If you don't want to do the work to explain to someone how their post is breaking the rules, don't be a mod. It's not that complicated. \n\nI'd rather be a part of a forum that isn't primary a revolving door of newbie accounts with easily answered questions because the veterans are fed up with lazy, but somehow simultaneously power tripping mods. That's how you look when you shrug and say \"I don't care if there's problems, I personally like it this way.\" I think most people feel the same. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

And if a SB messages a SD asking like \"what are you offering?\" I've found most guys are very unwilling to give averages or any info at all. They're hoping us SBs don't know how much to ask for so that basically we undervalue ourselves and they get a deal, or at least that's what I've noticed in my area. I mean the \"Allowance Master Thread\" has 1 post from my area, and it's from a huge city 2 hours drive away.

There were a very select few yikes that I saw a guy say a woman was lying about her allowance, but I think most of the time it was just people trying to give advice that the reality of the situation was that you could hold out for that huge allowance, but it wasn\u2019t likely to happen.

Being a mod is thankless work and I get that but it being thankless doesn't excuse you from doing your job\n* Kinda dumb. If there's clear issues maybe don't strive to keep adding numbers to an obviously broken system? It's like working in tech and having an unfinished web app but adding users to it anyway. Yeah, it can probably function (even well in some regards) but eventually the system is going to lag and be difficult to use at an Enterprise level leading everyone to be annoyed that they have to use the legacy system to accomplish things. \"No one has to use SLF\" is not an acceptable response---the best part about SLF is that it isn't an echo chamber and we have a sidebar that is **supposed** to protect everyone. It would be redundant and nonsensical to make the entire forum again and hope people move over to a new platform because the old one's only issue was (what is probably) a few mod diplomacy issues. Especially when there has been an uptick in mod responses to threads like these and overall mod activity (though that happens in q1 regardless) but yet..... y'all want community feedback but aren't going to use it? What in tarnation. \n\nIf you don't want to do your job as a moderator to be impartial and uphold the rules even when you personally don't agree with them, then either vote to change/clarify/restate the rules or step down as mod. If you don't want to do the work to explain to someone how their post is breaking the rules, don't be a mod. It's not that complicated. \n\nI'd rather be a part of a forum that isn't primary a revolving door of newbie accounts with easily answered questions because the veterans are fed up with lazy, but somehow simultaneously power tripping mods. That's how you look when you shrug and say \"I don't care if there's problems, I personally like it this way.\" I think most people feel the same. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

I will say in the past that it mostly cane down to a few women on the sub that would chastise any SB that wasn\u2019t in  huge monthly allowance situation and at the same time would call any guy they didn\u2019t feel was paying enough a John/salt daddy. There were a very select few yikes that I saw a guy say a woman was lying about her allowance, but I think most of the time it was just people trying to give advice that the reality of the situation was that you could hold out for that huge allowance, but it wasn\u2019t likely to happen. I remember getting insulted on here when I said my monthly allowance roughly equaled rent/utilities on a nice apartment in my area and was told I was salt because of it by multiple SB\u2019s on here.",

Being a mod is thankless work and I get that but it being thankless doesn't excuse you from doing your job\n* Kinda dumb. If there's clear issues maybe don't strive to keep adding numbers to an obviously broken system? It's like working in tech and having an unfinished web app but adding users to it anyway. Yeah, it can probably function (even well in some regards) but eventually the system is going to lag and be difficult to use at an Enterprise level leading everyone to be annoyed that they have to use the legacy system to accomplish things. \"No one has to use SLF\" is not an acceptable response---the best part about SLF is that it isn't an echo chamber and we have a sidebar that is **supposed** to protect everyone. It would be redundant and nonsensical to make the entire forum again and hope people move over to a new platform because the old one's only issue was (what is probably) a few mod diplomacy issues. Especially when there has been an uptick in mod responses to threads like these and overall mod activity (though that happens in q1 regardless) but yet..... y'all want community feedback but aren't going to use it? What in tarnation. \n\nIf you don't want to do your job as a moderator to be impartial and uphold the rules even when you personally don't agree with them, then either vote to change/clarify/restate the rules or step down as mod. If you don't want to do the work to explain to someone how their post is breaking the rules, don't be a mod. It's not that complicated. \n\nI'd rather be a part of a forum that isn't primary a revolving door of newbie accounts with easily answered questions because the veterans are fed up with lazy, but somehow simultaneously power tripping mods. That's how you look when you shrug and say \"I don't care if there's problems, I personally like it this way.\" I think most people feel the same. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

Being a mod is thankless work and I get that but it being thankless doesn't excuse you from doing your job\n* Kinda dumb. If there's clear issues maybe don't strive to keep adding numbers to an obviously broken system? It's like working in tech and having an unfinished web app but adding users to it anyway. Yeah, it can probably function (even well in some regards) but eventually the system is going to lag and be difficult to use at an Enterprise level leading everyone to be annoyed that they have to use the legacy system to accomplish things. \"No one has to use SLF\" is not an acceptable response---the best part about SLF is that it isn't an echo chamber and we have a sidebar that is **supposed** to protect everyone. It would be redundant and nonsensical to make the entire forum again and hope people move over to a new platform because the old one's only issue was (what is probably) a few mod diplomacy issues. Especially when there has been an uptick in mod responses to threads like these and overall mod activity (though that happens in q1 regardless) but yet..... y'all want community feedback but aren't going to use it? What in tarnation. \n\nIf you don't want to do your job as a moderator to be impartial and uphold the rules even when you personally don't agree with them, then either vote to change/clarify/restate the rules or step down as mod. If you don't want to do the work to explain to someone how their post is breaking the rules, don't be a mod. It's not that complicated. \n\nI'd rather be a part of a forum that isn't primary a revolving door of newbie accounts with easily answered questions because the veterans are fed up with lazy, but somehow simultaneously power tripping mods. That's how you look when you shrug and say \"I don't care if there's problems, I personally like it this way.\" I think most people feel the same. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

If there's clear issues maybe don't strive to keep adding numbers to an obviously broken system? It's like working in tech and having an unfinished web app but adding users to it anyway. Yeah, it can probably function (even well in some regards) but eventually the system is going to lag and be difficult to use at an Enterprise level leading everyone to be annoyed that they have to use the legacy system to accomplish things. \"No one has to use SLF\" is not an acceptable response---the best part about SLF is that it isn't an echo chamber and we have a sidebar that is **supposed** to protect everyone. It would be redundant and nonsensical to make the entire forum again and hope people move over to a new platform because the old one's only issue was (what is probably) a few mod diplomacy issues. Especially when there has been an uptick in mod responses to threads like these and overall mod activity (though that happens in q1 regardless) but yet..... y'all want community feedback but aren't going to use it? What in tarnation. \n\nIf you don't want to do your job as a moderator to be impartial and uphold the rules even when you personally don't agree with them, then either vote to change/clarify/restate the rules or step down as mod. If you don't want to do the work to explain to someone how their post is breaking the rules, don't be a mod. It's not that complicated. \n\nI'd rather be a part of a forum that isn't primary a revolving door of newbie accounts with easily answered questions because the veterans are fed up with lazy, but somehow simultaneously power tripping mods. That's how you look when you shrug and say \"I don't care if there's problems, I personally like it this way.\" I think most people feel the same. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

Being a mod is thankless work and I get that but it being thankless doesn't excuse you from doing your job\n* Kinda dumb. If there's clear issues maybe don't strive to keep adding numbers to an obviously broken system? It's like working in tech and having an unfinished web app but adding users to it anyway. Yeah, it can probably function (even well in some regards) but eventually the system is going to lag and be difficult to use at an Enterprise level leading everyone to be annoyed that they have to use the legacy system to accomplish things. \"No one has to use SLF\" is not an acceptable response---the best part about SLF is that it isn't an echo chamber and we have a sidebar that is **supposed** to protect everyone. It would be redundant and nonsensical to make the entire forum again and hope people move over to a new platform because the old one's only issue was (what is probably) a few mod diplomacy issues. Especially when there has been an uptick in mod responses to threads like these and overall mod activity (though that happens in q1 regardless) but yet..... y'all want community feedback but aren't going to use it? What in tarnation. \n\nIf you don't want to do your job as a moderator to be impartial and uphold the rules even when you personally don't agree with them, then either vote to change/clarify/restate the rules or step down as mod. If you don't want to do the work to explain to someone how their post is breaking the rules, don't be a mod. It's not that complicated. \n\nI'd rather be a part of a forum that isn't primary a revolving door of newbie accounts with easily answered questions because the veterans are fed up with lazy, but somehow simultaneously power tripping mods. That's how you look when you shrug and say \"I don't care if there's problems, I personally like it this way.\" I think most people feel the same. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
