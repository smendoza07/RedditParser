Kakashi can't hang with 7 gates gai. He can't tie with him and he can't beat him. He can hang with 5 or 6 gates at most, and that's if he opens a gate himself. He simply doesn't have the speed or stamina",

Canonically, the reanimation jutsu revives people in their prime, but they have all their memories up to their death regardless of what their prime may be. This was stated by Kabuto, who perfected the jutsu after Orochimaru. Orochimaru observed Kabuto's use of the jutsu and was able to replicate it himself just fine with no effort. However, that's very abstract and we doubt that the jutsu does this automatically. Our theory is that the jutsu revives the person at whatever the caster personally considers to be that person's prime, whether intentionally or unconsciously. Orochimaru was the one who revived the hokage, not Kabuto. Based on that, it makes sense that Orochimaru would consider old man Hiruzen as being \"prime.\" For one, Orochimaru values knowledge over all else, evidenced by his all consuming quest to learn every jutsu known to man and then further create more. Hiruzen was known as \"The Professor\" because he supposedly knew and could proficiently use every single jutsu known to the leaf village that wasn't dependent on kekkei genkai, and could also use all 5 nature transformations. It's heavily implied that he was outside of his physical prime when he completed this knowledge base of his, and so Orochimaru likely considers his older form to be the prime of his knowledge. But beyond that, far more importantly, Orochimaru got absolutely fucking *bodied* by Lord Hiruzen. He had the reanimation a of Lord First and Lord Second doing most of the work for him and Hiruzen still not only kept up, but destroyed the reanimations and ripped out Orochimaru's arms/the soul of his arms. If it weren't for that sword which has the uniquely specific ability to float and be controlled with mere hand motions, Orochimaru would have died. And if he didn't have Lord First and Lord Second, he would've gotten completely destroyed by Hiruzen without the need for the Reaper Death Seal. My friends and I genuinely believe that Lord Hiruzen put the fucking fear of god into Orochimaru that day and ever since he's considered old man Hiruzen to be the highest prime of Lord Third.\n\nTL:DR - Hiruzen gave Orochimaru extreme PTSD and as such Orochimaru unconsciously considered old man Hiruzen to be \"prime\" when he was reviving the hokage",

He never fought Hidan and Kakuzu at the same time, when he fought Hidan It was Shikamaru, Choji and Ino trying their best to hold off Kakuzu but getting their assess handed to them. Then Kakuzu\u2019s hearts got involved with Kakashi\u2019s fight so he dealt with Hidan by tricking him with a shadow clone and moved on to Kakuzu, then while Kakashi was fighting Kakuzu, AND ONLY Kakuzu, Shikamaru dealt with Hidan and removed him from the fight by bringing him to the location where his trap was already set up. Kakashi continued to fight Kakuzu 1 on 1, got his ass handed to him and was about to have his heart literally ripped right out of his chest right before Shikamaru saved him by tricking Hidan into using Kakuzu\u2019s blood in his ritual. I know how the fight went buddy, but you calling Kakuzu fodder just shows how ignorant you actually are lmfao. \u201cA supposed high level nin getting snuck up on\u201d didn\u2019t I already explain to you that sneaking up on your opponent while their guard is down has been shown to be extremely effective against the most powerful of opponents through the entire series?

Damn son you salty af right now. Throwing out insults. Being caught off guard is the very essence of speed blitz. You need to provide me with a definition of sneak attacks being excluded.\n\n>No, I\u2019m not wrong. He never fought Hidan and Kakuzu at the same time,\n\nYes, yes you are. You can say he didn't all you want, but Kakashi fought them both. If you'd have watched the video you'd know this.\n\n>but you calling Kakuzu fodder just shows how ignorant you actually are lmfao.\n\nHe is fodder. He lost to a fatigued Naruto and his barely functioning Rasenshuriken.\n\n>didn\u2019t I already explain to you that sneaking up on your opponent while their guard is down has been shown to be extremely effective against the most powerful of opponents through the entire series? \n\nYeah, and it shouldn't happen to high-level ninjas unless I don't know, that Ninja is facing someone strong? Like Kakashi. Someone who is stronger than Kakazu. And Faster. Which is why he got blitzed. Anyways have a good day stranger. I won't respond to whatever dribble you post next because it'll probably be more angry upset dribble that is laughably incorrect. \n\ntl:dr Kakazu sucks",

You probably live a very sheltered life and have never even been punched in the face let alone been in an actual fight so I\u2019ll give you a little bit of information when it comes to this stuff, being aware of your surroundings makes a huge difference in a fight. This is why there is a clear cut difference between a speed blitz and a sneak attack, on one hand you\u2019re aware of the fact that you\u2019re actually in a fight and have an opponent but your opponent is so fast you\u2019re incapable of reacting to them. On the other hand you\u2019re completely unaware of the fact that you even have an opponent in the first place and get snuck up on. Though I\u2019m probably wasting my time as you already have trouble distinguishing between these two things and will likely continue to be ignorant to the facts even after they\u2019re explained in simple enough terms for you to understand. \n\nI love how all you can do is throw out insults, then play victim and simply ignore facts.

When Mifune and Hanzo meet again in the 4th Ninja War, Mifune is stronger than before.\n\nSince Mifune and the Sannin never interact, we can apply ABC logic here.

Literally.\n\nThere is no evidence supporting Orochimaru being stronger than Jiraiya. Leaving is not that evidence. Naruto was stronger than Sasuke when Sasuke left, which only further proves my point. He not only didn't bother to summon chief toad against him, he also was too petty to go for the win during their clash and sliced his forehead instead of aiming for his body to take the win. But again, even if Naruto had won, *nothing* would've stopped Sasuke from leaving. You can't make people stay if they don't want to. It's just not happening, regardless how much stronger someone is. Sasuke was weaker than Naruto and still left. It would take Sasuke to have a change in heart to stay, just like Oro.\n\nIt's you who doesn't understand how being OP works. You don't just label anybody you think is strong \"OP\". That's just not how that fucking works. You can't have a dozen people who are all relative to each other and say they're all OP. No. Again, going by your logic, many more characters are \"OP\" just for being strong, like Tsunade or Hiruzen, or even Kakashi. Not at all how that works. But, since it's all relative to you, Guy, Jiraiya, Kakashi, Tsunde, Oro, Itachi, Kisame, Hiruzen, Gaara, Naruto, Sasuke, etc are all OP for just being a lot stronger than those around them. Hell, even Zabuza who's killed how many people already? You know that saying, \"if everyone is special, then no one is special\"? Yeah, same shit applies here.\n\nItachi wouldn't just be \"running from Kakashi\", he'd be running from Kakashi, Guy, and Kurenai. There is no excuse for him running from Jiraiya unless he was weaker than him, especially not when it's a 2v1 with Kisame. He literally let Naruto go, the kid he came to the leaf for to begin with, just to run from Jiraiya.\n\nAll I could say is just agree to disagree. This ain't going anywhere and I'm not gonna keep repeating myself.",

His time in the Anbu especially were friendless. Hell this is the whole reason he was so harsh on new recruits as a teacher. He kept to himself. It's also why he never dates. Again as he keeps to himself. He barely had friends and family. He respected his coworkers enough to emotional about it but not the same level as an entire extended family you all knew personally. Who Sasuke had go watch all get buried too. The numbers Kakashi buried were not personal. And no I didnt say that Tsukiyomi is the only comparable place. That's something you're making up lol\n\nTalking about what they physically had to go through I'd say is equal. What Orochimaru makes him go through more than makes up for a decade of shit so I agree with you there. Also dont get me started on how traumatic that shit is lol he was twisted for good reasons. \n\nIt isn't physical at all. Which is why Sasuke though exhausted isn't seen as damaged in anyway after their fight in shippuden. Hell they even go through quite a bit in genjutsu and neither are wounded. It is not physical. Never have been.  (They even explain it isnt so please drop it. Reiterating the facts is annoying. Even IT isnt physical. Like really dude dont...) \n\nAnd yeah it could be a lifetime which is why the amount of shit Sasuke went through in Tsukiyomi was greater. He sees more. Period. Its stated multiple times what they all went through. And hell 8 yrs old Sasuke (yes 8 which again means he went though much worse than ADULT Kakashi did in Tsukiyomi) isnt the only time he goes through it. He did get put in it in more times than Kakashi too in just about every meet up they had. \n\nRight and how did that help Sasuke exactly? They had one talk and one training session and that amounted to Sasuke just leaving. He wasnt fixed. His therapy lasted one session that didnt help. So in reality, neither did Sasuke. It would be the equivalent of starting therapy then leaving and saying you're cured. What you're doing makes no sense as an argument.  And technically yeah Guy helped him quite a bit which is why Kakashi wasnt a top root agent hell bent on destruction. He had someone snap him out of it. Go back and review their pasts, Kakashi was on the same path and had someone actually help him before it was too late. Sasuke had this but he ended up leaving before the help could reach him. The help was missing context (which is thematically why Naruto loss btw) \n\nRight which is less than Sasuke. His sensei and squad are what made him shut shit down and then with the exception of Guy cutting in at every chance Kakashi had no one close to him afterwards. He went through less. It's actually hilarious as you number what he went through and then say he went through more when the math doesnt add up.",

Its based on signals sent to and from the brain people have used certain mental methods to kill people purely based off their perception and pain can be felt without being damaged in those areas. Tsukuyomi literally made his body experience the pain of being stabbed over and over for ages. Again we also dont know how long.\n\nI also never said he went through more he went through sht comparable to Sasuke. Your nonsense doesnt negate that. He is a shinobi that has seen thousands and thousands of bodies pile up at his feet. He is a man who has been through hell and back and the fact that you act like Sasuke has been through an incomparable hell when the majority of his trauma is a singular event thay haunted him is ridiculous. That single even was massive and while Kakashis events were much smaller they add up quite a bit when its your every day life for over a decade. Hell Sasuke didnt even live with his torment as long. Im not saying he hasnt been through hell either. Id put them on equal ground and you even make good points but to act like Sasuke is leagues more traumatized than a 2 time war veteran is ridiculous.",

Does this really count as a win?\n\n-Ill give him Zabuza i guess.\n\n\nBut what incredible feats has he done by himself? \n\n\nJiraya took on pain by himself and took out 3 of the bodies before he died. \n\n\nGuy took madara to the brink. He made light work of kisame. \n\nShikamaru was the mastermind behind getting rid of hidan. \n\nMinato actually beat obito solo without sharingan, and went toe to toe with the raikage\n\nAn old past his prime hiruzen took on a healthy orochi who had edo tensei 1st and 2nd hokage. Didn\u2019t win but was able to take away orochi\u2019s jutsu. And before people say orochi isn\u2019t a tough fight, kakashi nearly shat himself at the thought of fighting him solo\n\nB was kicking Sasuke and his team\u2019s ass before he even activated his 8 tails.\n\n(For sasuke and naruto ill only add stuff before pre uber hand me down power ups)\n\nSasuke beat deidara, a guy who was able to capture a kage that had a biju. While sasuke didn\u2019t really beat itachi, taking him to the point he did with just a regular susano is very impressive, even if itachi was sick (that\u2019s just how op itachi was lol) He also beat Danzo but since he relied on MS, We wont count that even if it was imperfect. \n\nNaruto took on pain by himself and took out a majority of the bodies before getting bailed out by the 9 tails, and even then refused to use the 9 tails to beat the last body.\n\nFor someone who is supposedly Kage level, kakashi\u2019s solo feats are not that impressive.

He\u2019s kind, incredibly smart (possibly smarter than shikamaru, remember when he figured out a way for naruto to cut down training time by literally 200 when time was of essence?) and he could\u2019ve gone dark pretty easily given that every one he ever cared about died when he was young, but instead he became the most loving, protective, dependable, charming person. It broke my heart when sasuke asked him what he would feel like if he killed everyone he cared about, and he replied everyone was already dead with a smile. He\u2019s also charismatic af and cool under pressure. No matter what insane shit is happening, he always keeps his cool because he knows thinking calmly is extremely important, and he REFUSES to lose if it means one of his comrades or students is gonna die. He\u2019s always putting his life on the line. I don\u2019t think he gets the credit he deserves. The number of missions he has completed is unreal as well, but not surprising since he became a jounin and even the captain of the anbu at a young age. Even though he has a low chakra reserve, he makes up for it by his insane intelligence-strategic mind, and effective use of his chakra. He deserves his fame for creating a jutsu like chidori at that young age alone. It cracked me up when kakuzu immediately knew who he was when he struck him with chidori. He deserves it ALL. Even though he himself said otherwise, I honestly think he had always been one of the strongest characters in Naruto all throughout. The interesting thing about naruto is that in any given fight, there\u2019s so many factors to say for sure who would win. So, technically, Naruto was \u201cstronger\u201d than kakashi mid shippuden when he just created rasen-shuriken like kakashi said, but I\u2019m confident Naruto wouldn\u2019t have won against Kakashi as he can\u2019t compare in intelligence. An actual fight is too complicated to pick a winner simply because one is greater in strength. That\u2019s one of the things i love about naruto, tbh. \nI\u2019m sorry for rambling, I just think Kakashi is underrated, and found an opportunity to share my opinion",

And a lot more. \n\nRegardless, the show is awesome af and even though i know what will happen, the way they happen is still a mystery. For example. I didnt know the 8 tails rapped lmao.",

Canonically, the reanimation jutsu revives people in their prime, but they have all their memories up to their death regardless of what their prime may be. This was stated by Kabuto, who perfected the jutsu after Orochimaru. Orochimaru observed Kabuto's use of the jutsu and was able to replicate it himself just fine with no effort. However, that's very abstract and we doubt that the jutsu does this automatically. Our theory is that the jutsu revives the person at whatever the caster personally considers to be that person's prime, whether intentionally or unconsciously. Orochimaru was the one who revived the hokage, not Kabuto. Based on that, it makes sense that Orochimaru would consider old man Hiruzen as being \"prime.\" For one, Orochimaru values knowledge over all else, evidenced by his all consuming quest to learn every jutsu known to man and then further create more. Hiruzen was known as \"The Professor\" because he supposedly knew and could proficiently use every single jutsu known to the leaf village that wasn't dependent on kekkei genkai, and could also use all 5 nature transformations. It's heavily implied that he was outside of his physical prime when he completed this knowledge base of his, and so Orochimaru likely considers his older form to be the prime of his knowledge. But beyond that, far more importantly, Orochimaru got absolutely fucking *bodied* by Lord Hiruzen. He had the reanimation a of Lord First and Lord Second doing most of the work for him and Hiruzen still not only kept up, but destroyed the reanimations and ripped out Orochimaru's arms/the soul of his arms. If it weren't for that sword which has the uniquely specific ability to float and be controlled with mere hand motions, Orochimaru would have died. And if he didn't have Lord First and Lord Second, he would've gotten completely destroyed by Hiruzen without the need for the Reaper Death Seal. My friends and I genuinely believe that Lord Hiruzen put the fucking fear of god into Orochimaru that day and ever since he's considered old man Hiruzen to be the highest prime of Lord Third.\n\nTL:DR - Hiruzen gave Orochimaru extreme PTSD and as such Orochimaru unconsciously considered old man Hiruzen to be \"prime\" when he was reviving the hokage",

In fact Kakuzu is already an example of this as a nerfed Kakuzu who just had one of his hearts destroyed by Kakashi proceeded to whoop his ass and nearly kill him in a head on fight where he no longer had his guard down.",

Then Kakuzu\u2019s hearts got involved with Kakashi\u2019s fight so he dealt with Hidan by tricking him with a shadow clone and moved on to Kakuzu, then while Kakashi was fighting Kakuzu, AND ONLY Kakuzu, Shikamaru dealt with Hidan and removed him from the fight by bringing him to the location where his trap was already set up. Kakashi continued to fight Kakuzu 1 on 1, got his ass handed to him and was about to have his heart literally ripped right out of his chest right before Shikamaru saved him by tricking Hidan into using Kakuzu\u2019s blood in his ritual. I know how the fight went buddy, but you calling Kakuzu fodder just shows how ignorant you actually are lmfao. \u201cA supposed high level nin getting snuck up on\u201d didn\u2019t I already explain to you that sneaking up on your opponent while their guard is down has been shown to be extremely effective against the most powerful of opponents through the entire series?

On the other hand you\u2019re completely unaware of the fact that you even have an opponent in the first place and get snuck up on. Though I\u2019m probably wasting my time as you already have trouble distinguishing between these two things and will likely continue to be ignorant to the facts even after they\u2019re explained in simple enough terms for you to understand. \n\nI love how all you can do is throw out insults, then play victim and simply ignore facts. But then again, ignorance is bliss. \n\nAlso\u2026 it\u2019s drivel, not dribble\ud83d\udc80",

When Mifune and Hanzo meet again in the 4th Ninja War, Mifune is stronger than before.\n\nSince Mifune and the Sannin never interact, we can apply ABC logic here. Hanzo is stronger than the Sannin and Mifune is pretty much his equal, so Mifune, (in theory) is stronger than them as well.",

Literally.\n\nThere is no evidence supporting Orochimaru being stronger than Jiraiya. Leaving is not that evidence. Naruto was stronger than Sasuke when Sasuke left, which only further proves my point. He not only didn't bother to summon chief toad against him, he also was too petty to go for the win during their clash and sliced his forehead instead of aiming for his body to take the win. But again, even if Naruto had won, *nothing* would've stopped Sasuke from leaving. You can't make people stay if they don't want to. It's just not happening, regardless how much stronger someone is. Sasuke was weaker than Naruto and still left. It would take Sasuke to have a change in heart to stay, just like Oro.\n\nIt's you who doesn't understand how being OP works. You don't just label anybody you think is strong \"OP\". That's just not how that fucking works. You can't have a dozen people who are all relative to each other and say they're all OP. No. Again, going by your logic, many more characters are \"OP\" just for being strong, like Tsunade or Hiruzen, or even Kakashi. Not at all how that works. But, since it's all relative to you, Guy, Jiraiya, Kakashi, Tsunde, Oro, Itachi, Kisame, Hiruzen, Gaara, Naruto, Sasuke, etc are all OP for just being a lot stronger than those around them. Hell, even Zabuza who's killed how many people already? You know that saying, \"if everyone is special, then no one is special\"? Yeah, same shit applies here.\n\nItachi wouldn't just be \"running from Kakashi\", he'd be running from Kakashi, Guy, and Kurenai. There is no excuse for him running from Jiraiya unless he was weaker than him, especially not when it's a 2v1 with Kisame. He literally let Naruto go, the kid he came to the leaf for to begin with, just to run from Jiraiya.\n\nAll I could say is just agree to disagree. This ain't going anywhere and I'm not gonna keep repeating myself.",

Itachi was a double agent and did not want to actually capture Naruto. \n\nRunning against Jiraiya was a valid excuse Kisame would buy. \n\n\nYou do not know what OP means. It is relative. Naruto is OP in the Naruto verse. Place him in the DB verse and he\u2019s no longer OP. Being OP is in comparison to the competition. \n\nAt that time in the story (which we all specified) Itachi was the strongest compared to anyone else, and therefore, OP. Stop being so dense. \n\nAgain, you\u2019re just arguing for the sake of arguing. Why is so hard for people on the internet to let go of their pride and just admit they were wrong or misunderstood something. Jeez.\n\n(Btw, you absolutely can stop someone from leaving.

His time in the Anbu especially were friendless. Hell this is the whole reason he was so harsh on new recruits as a teacher. He kept to himself. It's also why he never dates. Again as he keeps to himself. He barely had friends and family. He respected his coworkers enough to emotional about it but not the same level as an entire extended family you all knew personally. Who Sasuke had go watch all get buried too. The numbers Kakashi buried were not personal. And no I didnt say that Tsukiyomi is the only comparable place. That's something you're making up lol\n\nTalking about what they physically had to go through I'd say is equal. What Orochimaru makes him go through more than makes up for a decade of shit so I agree with you there. Also dont get me started on how traumatic that shit is lol he was twisted for good reasons. \n\nIt isn't physical at all. Which is why Sasuke though exhausted isn't seen as damaged in anyway after their fight in shippuden. Hell they even go through quite a bit in genjutsu and neither are wounded. It is not physical. Never have been.  (They even explain it isnt so please drop it. Reiterating the facts is annoying. Even IT isnt physical. Like really dude dont...) \n\nAnd yeah it could be a lifetime which is why the amount of shit Sasuke went through in Tsukiyomi was greater. He sees more. Period. Its stated multiple times what they all went through. And hell 8 yrs old Sasuke (yes 8 which again means he went though much worse than ADULT Kakashi did in Tsukiyomi) isnt the only time he goes through it. He did get put in it in more times than Kakashi too in just about every meet up they had. \n\nRight and how did that help Sasuke exactly? They had one talk and one training session and that amounted to Sasuke just leaving. He wasnt fixed. His therapy lasted one session that didnt help. So in reality, neither did Sasuke. It would be the equivalent of starting therapy then leaving and saying you're cured. What you're doing makes no sense as an argument.  And technically yeah Guy helped him quite a bit which is why Kakashi wasnt a top root agent hell bent on destruction. He had someone snap him out of it. Go back and review their pasts, Kakashi was on the same path and had someone actually help him before it was too late. Sasuke had this but he ended up leaving before the help could reach him. The help was missing context (which is thematically why Naruto loss btw) \n\nRight which is less than Sasuke. His sensei and squad are what made him shut shit down and then with the exception of Guy cutting in at every chance Kakashi had no one close to him afterwards. He went through less. It's actually hilarious as you number what he went through and then say he went through more when the math doesnt add up.",

Its based on signals sent to and from the brain people have used certain mental methods to kill people purely based off their perception and pain can be felt without being damaged in those areas. Tsukuyomi literally made his body experience the pain of being stabbed over and over for ages. Again we also dont know how long.\n\nI also never said he went through more he went through sht comparable to Sasuke. Your nonsense doesnt negate that. He is a shinobi that has seen thousands and thousands of bodies pile up at his feet. He is a man who has been through hell and back and the fact that you act like Sasuke has been through an incomparable hell when the majority of his trauma is a singular event thay haunted him is ridiculous. That single even was massive and while Kakashis events were much smaller they add up quite a bit when its your every day life for over a decade. Hell Sasuke didnt even live with his torment as long. Im not saying he hasnt been through hell either. Id put them on equal ground and you even make good points but to act like Sasuke is leagues more traumatized than a 2 time war veteran is ridiculous.",

Canonically, the reanimation jutsu revives people in their prime, but they have all their memories up to their death regardless of what their prime may be. This was stated by Kabuto, who perfected the jutsu after Orochimaru. Orochimaru observed Kabuto's use of the jutsu and was able to replicate it himself just fine with no effort. However, that's very abstract and we doubt that the jutsu does this automatically. Our theory is that the jutsu revives the person at whatever the caster personally considers to be that person's prime, whether intentionally or unconsciously. Orochimaru was the one who revived the hokage, not Kabuto. Based on that, it makes sense that Orochimaru would consider old man Hiruzen as being \"prime.\" For one, Orochimaru values knowledge over all else, evidenced by his all consuming quest to learn every jutsu known to man and then further create more. Hiruzen was known as \"The Professor\" because he supposedly knew and could proficiently use every single jutsu known to the leaf village that wasn't dependent on kekkei genkai, and could also use all 5 nature transformations. It's heavily implied that he was outside of his physical prime when he completed this knowledge base of his, and so Orochimaru likely considers his older form to be the prime of his knowledge. But beyond that, far more importantly, Orochimaru got absolutely fucking *bodied* by Lord Hiruzen. He had the reanimation a of Lord First and Lord Second doing most of the work for him and Hiruzen still not only kept up, but destroyed the reanimations and ripped out Orochimaru's arms/the soul of his arms. If it weren't for that sword which has the uniquely specific ability to float and be controlled with mere hand motions, Orochimaru would have died. And if he didn't have Lord First and Lord Second, he would've gotten completely destroyed by Hiruzen without the need for the Reaper Death Seal. My friends and I genuinely believe that Lord Hiruzen put the fucking fear of god into Orochimaru that day and ever since he's considered old man Hiruzen to be the highest prime of Lord Third.\n\nTL:DR - Hiruzen gave Orochimaru extreme PTSD and as such Orochimaru unconsciously considered old man Hiruzen to be \"prime\" when he was reviving the hokage",

Unlike outpacing where the character is generally just faster but the other side can still keep up, a blitz leaves no hope for the other side to keep up.\n](https://debatesjungle.fandom.com/wiki/Speed_Blitz)\n\nKakashi attacks Kakazu before Kakazu reacts.

Whilst also protecting Ino-shika-cho from attacks. Did you watch the video instead of just react downvoting? You also gotta remember that Kakashi was tired prior to this fight.

Go watch the fight. Stop being a baby and accept that you are wrong lmao. They even use a tagteam manuever against Kakashi lmao. Kakazu fanboys trip me out.

He never fought Hidan and Kakuzu at the same time, when he fought Hidan It was Shikamaru, Choji and Ino trying their best to hold off Kakuzu but getting their assess handed to them. Then Kakuzu\u2019s hearts got involved with Kakashi\u2019s fight so he dealt with Hidan by tricking him with a shadow clone and moved on to Kakuzu, then while Kakashi was fighting Kakuzu, AND ONLY Kakuzu, Shikamaru dealt with Hidan and removed him from the fight by bringing him to the location where his trap was already set up. Kakashi continued to fight Kakuzu 1 on 1, got his ass handed to him and was about to have his heart literally ripped right out of his chest right before Shikamaru saved him by tricking Hidan into using Kakuzu\u2019s blood in his ritual. I know how the fight went buddy, but you calling Kakuzu fodder just shows how ignorant you actually are lmfao. \u201cA supposed high level nin getting snuck up on\u201d didn\u2019t I already explain to you that sneaking up on your opponent while their guard is down has been shown to be extremely effective against the most powerful of opponents through the entire series?

Damn son you salty af right now. Throwing out insults. Being caught off guard is the very essence of speed blitz. You need to provide me with a definition of sneak attacks being excluded.\n\n>No, I\u2019m not wrong. He never fought Hidan and Kakuzu at the same time,\n\nYes, yes you are. You can say he didn't all you want, but Kakashi fought them both. If you'd have watched the video you'd know this.\n\n>but you calling Kakuzu fodder just shows how ignorant you actually are lmfao.\n\nHe is fodder. He lost to a fatigued Naruto and his barely functioning Rasenshuriken.\n\n>didn\u2019t I already explain to you that sneaking up on your opponent while their guard is down has been shown to be extremely effective against the most powerful of opponents through the entire series? \n\nYeah, and it shouldn't happen to high-level ninjas unless I don't know, that Ninja is facing someone strong? Like Kakashi. Someone who is stronger than Kakazu. And Faster. Which is why he got blitzed. Anyways have a good day stranger. I won't respond to whatever dribble you post next because it'll probably be more angry upset dribble that is laughably incorrect. \n\ntl:dr Kakazu sucks",

You probably live a very sheltered life and have never even been punched in the face let alone been in an actual fight so I\u2019ll give you a little bit of information when it comes to this stuff, being aware of your surroundings makes a huge difference in a fight. This is why there is a clear cut difference between a speed blitz and a sneak attack, on one hand you\u2019re aware of the fact that you\u2019re actually in a fight and have an opponent but your opponent is so fast you\u2019re incapable of reacting to them. On the other hand you\u2019re completely unaware of the fact that you even have an opponent in the first place and get snuck up on. Though I\u2019m probably wasting my time as you already have trouble distinguishing between these two things and will likely continue to be ignorant to the facts even after they\u2019re explained in simple enough terms for you to understand. \n\nI love how all you can do is throw out insults, then play victim and simply ignore facts.

When Mifune and Hanzo meet again in the 4th Ninja War, Mifune is stronger than before.\n\nSince Mifune and the Sannin never interact, we can apply ABC logic here.

He was just *relative* to him.\n\nItachi was *strong* relative to everyone around him. Not OP. Gaara had killed countless grown men by the time of the chuunin exams, regardless if he could beat Guy or not, he was just OP in p1 going by your logic.\n\nItachi wasn't OP. No one from p1 is. Closest to it is Guy. \n\nIf it was only relative, then who's OP and who isn't constantly changes. Now that the entire Naruto show is done, in comparison to everyone in the show, he's not OP. At all. Just strong. You compare him to the entire verse, not just characters that are on-screen at the time. Pain existed during this time. So did Obito. It'd be reasonable to consider him OP if the show ended at the end of p1, but obviously that didn't happen, and we know what actual OP characters are. Pain was OP, compared to the entirety of the verse, Pain was literally one of the strongest people alive on the planet. \n\nIt simply doesn't make sense to consider someone who can be rivaled by a dozen people as OP. He isn't.",

Literally.\n\nThere is no evidence supporting Orochimaru being stronger than Jiraiya. Leaving is not that evidence. Naruto was stronger than Sasuke when Sasuke left, which only further proves my point. He not only didn't bother to summon chief toad against him, he also was too petty to go for the win during their clash and sliced his forehead instead of aiming for his body to take the win. But again, even if Naruto had won, *nothing* would've stopped Sasuke from leaving. You can't make people stay if they don't want to. It's just not happening, regardless how much stronger someone is. Sasuke was weaker than Naruto and still left. It would take Sasuke to have a change in heart to stay, just like Oro.\n\nIt's you who doesn't understand how being OP works. You don't just label anybody you think is strong \"OP\". That's just not how that fucking works. You can't have a dozen people who are all relative to each other and say they're all OP. No. Again, going by your logic, many more characters are \"OP\" just for being strong, like Tsunade or Hiruzen, or even Kakashi. Not at all how that works. But, since it's all relative to you, Guy, Jiraiya, Kakashi, Tsunde, Oro, Itachi, Kisame, Hiruzen, Gaara, Naruto, Sasuke, etc are all OP for just being a lot stronger than those around them. Hell, even Zabuza who's killed how many people already? You know that saying, \"if everyone is special, then no one is special\"? Yeah, same shit applies here.\n\nItachi wouldn't just be \"running from Kakashi\", he'd be running from Kakashi, Guy, and Kurenai. There is no excuse for him running from Jiraiya unless he was weaker than him, especially not when it's a 2v1 with Kisame. He literally let Naruto go, the kid he came to the leaf for to begin with, just to run from Jiraiya.\n\nAll I could say is just agree to disagree. This ain't going anywhere and I'm not gonna keep repeating myself.",

His time in the Anbu especially were friendless. Hell this is the whole reason he was so harsh on new recruits as a teacher. He kept to himself. It's also why he never dates. Again as he keeps to himself. He barely had friends and family. He respected his coworkers enough to emotional about it but not the same level as an entire extended family you all knew personally. Who Sasuke had go watch all get buried too. The numbers Kakashi buried were not personal. And no I didnt say that Tsukiyomi is the only comparable place. That's something you're making up lol\n\nTalking about what they physically had to go through I'd say is equal. What Orochimaru makes him go through more than makes up for a decade of shit so I agree with you there. Also dont get me started on how traumatic that shit is lol he was twisted for good reasons. \n\nIt isn't physical at all. Which is why Sasuke though exhausted isn't seen as damaged in anyway after their fight in shippuden. Hell they even go through quite a bit in genjutsu and neither are wounded. It is not physical. Never have been.  (They even explain it isnt so please drop it. Reiterating the facts is annoying. Even IT isnt physical. Like really dude dont...) \n\nAnd yeah it could be a lifetime which is why the amount of shit Sasuke went through in Tsukiyomi was greater. He sees more. Period. Its stated multiple times what they all went through. And hell 8 yrs old Sasuke (yes 8 which again means he went though much worse than ADULT Kakashi did in Tsukiyomi) isnt the only time he goes through it. He did get put in it in more times than Kakashi too in just about every meet up they had. \n\nRight and how did that help Sasuke exactly? They had one talk and one training session and that amounted to Sasuke just leaving. He wasnt fixed. His therapy lasted one session that didnt help. So in reality, neither did Sasuke. It would be the equivalent of starting therapy then leaving and saying you're cured. What you're doing makes no sense as an argument.  And technically yeah Guy helped him quite a bit which is why Kakashi wasnt a top root agent hell bent on destruction. He had someone snap him out of it. Go back and review their pasts, Kakashi was on the same path and had someone actually help him before it was too late. Sasuke had this but he ended up leaving before the help could reach him. The help was missing context (which is thematically why Naruto loss btw) \n\nRight which is less than Sasuke. His sensei and squad are what made him shut shit down and then with the exception of Guy cutting in at every chance Kakashi had no one close to him afterwards. He went through less. It's actually hilarious as you number what he went through and then say he went through more when the math doesnt add up.",

Its based on signals sent to and from the brain people have used certain mental methods to kill people purely based off their perception and pain can be felt without being damaged in those areas. Tsukuyomi literally made his body experience the pain of being stabbed over and over for ages. Again we also dont know how long.\n\nI also never said he went through more he went through sht comparable to Sasuke. Your nonsense doesnt negate that. He is a shinobi that has seen thousands and thousands of bodies pile up at his feet. He is a man who has been through hell and back and the fact that you act like Sasuke has been through an incomparable hell when the majority of his trauma is a singular event thay haunted him is ridiculous. That single even was massive and while Kakashis events were much smaller they add up quite a bit when its your every day life for over a decade. Hell Sasuke didnt even live with his torment as long. Im not saying he hasnt been through hell either. Id put them on equal ground and you even make good points but to act like Sasuke is leagues more traumatized than a 2 time war veteran is ridiculous.",

Canonically, the reanimation jutsu revives people in their prime, but they have all their memories up to their death regardless of what their prime may be. This was stated by Kabuto, who perfected the jutsu after Orochimaru. Orochimaru observed Kabuto's use of the jutsu and was able to replicate it himself just fine with no effort. However, that's very abstract and we doubt that the jutsu does this automatically. Our theory is that the jutsu revives the person at whatever the caster personally considers to be that person's prime, whether intentionally or unconsciously. Orochimaru was the one who revived the hokage, not Kabuto. Based on that, it makes sense that Orochimaru would consider old man Hiruzen as being \"prime.\" For one, Orochimaru values knowledge over all else, evidenced by his all consuming quest to learn every jutsu known to man and then further create more. Hiruzen was known as \"The Professor\" because he supposedly knew and could proficiently use every single jutsu known to the leaf village that wasn't dependent on kekkei genkai, and could also use all 5 nature transformations. It's heavily implied that he was outside of his physical prime when he completed this knowledge base of his, and so Orochimaru likely considers his older form to be the prime of his knowledge. But beyond that, far more importantly, Orochimaru got absolutely fucking *bodied* by Lord Hiruzen. He had the reanimation a of Lord First and Lord Second doing most of the work for him and Hiruzen still not only kept up, but destroyed the reanimations and ripped out Orochimaru's arms/the soul of his arms. If it weren't for that sword which has the uniquely specific ability to float and be controlled with mere hand motions, Orochimaru would have died. And if he didn't have Lord First and Lord Second, he would've gotten completely destroyed by Hiruzen without the need for the Reaper Death Seal. My friends and I genuinely believe that Lord Hiruzen put the fucking fear of god into Orochimaru that day and ever since he's considered old man Hiruzen to be the highest prime of Lord Third.\n\nTL:DR - Hiruzen gave Orochimaru extreme PTSD and as such Orochimaru unconsciously considered old man Hiruzen to be \"prime\" when he was reviving the hokage",

He never fought Hidan and Kakuzu at the same time, when he fought Hidan It was Shikamaru, Choji and Ino trying their best to hold off Kakuzu but getting their assess handed to them. Then Kakuzu\u2019s hearts got involved with Kakashi\u2019s fight so he dealt with Hidan by tricking him with a shadow clone and moved on to Kakuzu, then while Kakashi was fighting Kakuzu, AND ONLY Kakuzu, Shikamaru dealt with Hidan and removed him from the fight by bringing him to the location where his trap was already set up. Kakashi continued to fight Kakuzu 1 on 1, got his ass handed to him and was about to have his heart literally ripped right out of his chest right before Shikamaru saved him by tricking Hidan into using Kakuzu\u2019s blood in his ritual. I know how the fight went buddy, but you calling Kakuzu fodder just shows how ignorant you actually are lmfao. \u201cA supposed high level nin getting snuck up on\u201d didn\u2019t I already explain to you that sneaking up on your opponent while their guard is down has been shown to be extremely effective against the most powerful of opponents through the entire series?

You probably live a very sheltered life and have never even been punched in the face let alone been in an actual fight so I\u2019ll give you a little bit of information when it comes to this stuff, being aware of your surroundings makes a huge difference in a fight. This is why there is a clear cut difference between a speed blitz and a sneak attack, on one hand you\u2019re aware of the fact that you\u2019re actually in a fight and have an opponent but your opponent is so fast you\u2019re incapable of reacting to them. On the other hand you\u2019re completely unaware of the fact that you even have an opponent in the first place and get snuck up on. Though I\u2019m probably wasting my time as you already have trouble distinguishing between these two things and will likely continue to be ignorant to the facts even after they\u2019re explained in simple enough terms for you to understand. \n\nI love how all you can do is throw out insults, then play victim and simply ignore facts. But then again, ignorance is bliss. \n\nAlso\u2026 it\u2019s drivel, not dribble\ud83d\udc80",

When Mifune and Hanzo meet again in the 4th Ninja War, Mifune is stronger than before.\n\nSince Mifune and the Sannin never interact, we can apply ABC logic here.

Literally.\n\nThere is no evidence supporting Orochimaru being stronger than Jiraiya. Leaving is not that evidence. Naruto was stronger than Sasuke when Sasuke left, which only further proves my point. He not only didn't bother to summon chief toad against him, he also was too petty to go for the win during their clash and sliced his forehead instead of aiming for his body to take the win. But again, even if Naruto had won, *nothing* would've stopped Sasuke from leaving. You can't make people stay if they don't want to. It's just not happening, regardless how much stronger someone is. Sasuke was weaker than Naruto and still left. It would take Sasuke to have a change in heart to stay, just like Oro.\n\nIt's you who doesn't understand how being OP works. You don't just label anybody you think is strong \"OP\". That's just not how that fucking works. You can't have a dozen people who are all relative to each other and say they're all OP. No. Again, going by your logic, many more characters are \"OP\" just for being strong, like Tsunade or Hiruzen, or even Kakashi. Not at all how that works. But, since it's all relative to you, Guy, Jiraiya, Kakashi, Tsunde, Oro, Itachi, Kisame, Hiruzen, Gaara, Naruto, Sasuke, etc are all OP for just being a lot stronger than those around them. Hell, even Zabuza who's killed how many people already? You know that saying, \"if everyone is special, then no one is special\"? Yeah, same shit applies here.\n\nItachi wouldn't just be \"running from Kakashi\", he'd be running from Kakashi, Guy, and Kurenai. There is no excuse for him running from Jiraiya unless he was weaker than him, especially not when it's a 2v1 with Kisame. He literally let Naruto go, the kid he came to the leaf for to begin with, just to run from Jiraiya.\n\nAll I could say is just agree to disagree. This ain't going anywhere and I'm not gonna keep repeating myself.",

Itachi was a double agent and did not want to actually capture Naruto. \n\nRunning against Jiraiya was a valid excuse Kisame would buy. \n\n\nYou do not know what OP means. It is relative. Naruto is OP in the Naruto verse. Place him in the DB verse and he\u2019s no longer OP.

His time in the Anbu especially were friendless. Hell this is the whole reason he was so harsh on new recruits as a teacher. He kept to himself. It's also why he never dates. Again as he keeps to himself. He barely had friends and family. He respected his coworkers enough to emotional about it but not the same level as an entire extended family you all knew personally. Who Sasuke had go watch all get buried too. The numbers Kakashi buried were not personal. And no I didnt say that Tsukiyomi is the only comparable place. That's something you're making up lol\n\nTalking about what they physically had to go through I'd say is equal. What Orochimaru makes him go through more than makes up for a decade of shit so I agree with you there. Also dont get me started on how traumatic that shit is lol he was twisted for good reasons. \n\nIt isn't physical at all. Which is why Sasuke though exhausted isn't seen as damaged in anyway after their fight in shippuden. Hell they even go through quite a bit in genjutsu and neither are wounded. It is not physical. Never have been.  (They even explain it isnt so please drop it. Reiterating the facts is annoying. Even IT isnt physical. Like really dude dont...) \n\nAnd yeah it could be a lifetime which is why the amount of shit Sasuke went through in Tsukiyomi was greater. He sees more. Period. Its stated multiple times what they all went through. And hell 8 yrs old Sasuke (yes 8 which again means he went though much worse than ADULT Kakashi did in Tsukiyomi) isnt the only time he goes through it. He did get put in it in more times than Kakashi too in just about every meet up they had. \n\nRight and how did that help Sasuke exactly? They had one talk and one training session and that amounted to Sasuke just leaving. He wasnt fixed. His therapy lasted one session that didnt help. So in reality, neither did Sasuke. It would be the equivalent of starting therapy then leaving and saying you're cured. What you're doing makes no sense as an argument.  And technically yeah Guy helped him quite a bit which is why Kakashi wasnt a top root agent hell bent on destruction. He had someone snap him out of it. Go back and review their pasts, Kakashi was on the same path and had someone actually help him before it was too late. Sasuke had this but he ended up leaving before the help could reach him. The help was missing context (which is thematically why Naruto loss btw) \n\nRight which is less than Sasuke. His sensei and squad are what made him shut shit down and then with the exception of Guy cutting in at every chance Kakashi had no one close to him afterwards. He went through less. It's actually hilarious as you number what he went through and then say he went through more when the math doesnt add up.",

Its based on signals sent to and from the brain people have used certain mental methods to kill people purely based off their perception and pain can be felt without being damaged in those areas. Tsukuyomi literally made his body experience the pain of being stabbed over and over for ages. Again we also dont know how long.\n\nI also never said he went through more he went through sht comparable to Sasuke. Your nonsense doesnt negate that. He is a shinobi that has seen thousands and thousands of bodies pile up at his feet. He is a man who has been through hell and back and the fact that you act like Sasuke has been through an incomparable hell when the majority of his trauma is a singular event thay haunted him is ridiculous. That single even was massive and while Kakashis events were much smaller they add up quite a bit when its your every day life for over a decade. Hell Sasuke didnt even live with his torment as long. Im not saying he hasnt been through hell either. Id put them on equal ground and you even make good points but to act like Sasuke is leagues more traumatized than a 2 time war veteran is ridiculous.",

Canonically, the reanimation jutsu revives people in their prime, but they have all their memories up to their death regardless of what their prime may be. This was stated by Kabuto, who perfected the jutsu after Orochimaru. Orochimaru observed Kabuto's use of the jutsu and was able to replicate it himself just fine with no effort. However, that's very abstract and we doubt that the jutsu does this automatically. Our theory is that the jutsu revives the person at whatever the caster personally considers to be that person's prime, whether intentionally or unconsciously. Orochimaru was the one who revived the hokage, not Kabuto. Based on that, it makes sense that Orochimaru would consider old man Hiruzen as being \"prime.\" For one, Orochimaru values knowledge over all else, evidenced by his all consuming quest to learn every jutsu known to man and then further create more. Hiruzen was known as \"The Professor\" because he supposedly knew and could proficiently use every single jutsu known to the leaf village that wasn't dependent on kekkei genkai, and could also use all 5 nature transformations. It's heavily implied that he was outside of his physical prime when he completed this knowledge base of his, and so Orochimaru likely considers his older form to be the prime of his knowledge. But beyond that, far more importantly, Orochimaru got absolutely fucking *bodied* by Lord Hiruzen. He had the reanimation a of Lord First and Lord Second doing most of the work for him and Hiruzen still not only kept up, but destroyed the reanimations and ripped out Orochimaru's arms/the soul of his arms. If it weren't for that sword which has the uniquely specific ability to float and be controlled with mere hand motions, Orochimaru would have died. And if he didn't have Lord First and Lord Second, he would've gotten completely destroyed by Hiruzen without the need for the Reaper Death Seal. My friends and I genuinely believe that Lord Hiruzen put the fucking fear of god into Orochimaru that day and ever since he's considered old man Hiruzen to be the highest prime of Lord Third.\n\nTL:DR - Hiruzen gave Orochimaru extreme PTSD and as such Orochimaru unconsciously considered old man Hiruzen to be \"prime\" when he was reviving the hokage",

He never fought Hidan and Kakuzu at the same time, when he fought Hidan It was Shikamaru, Choji and Ino trying their best to hold off Kakuzu but getting their assess handed to them. Then Kakuzu\u2019s hearts got involved with Kakashi\u2019s fight so he dealt with Hidan by tricking him with a shadow clone and moved on to Kakuzu, then while Kakashi was fighting Kakuzu, AND ONLY Kakuzu, Shikamaru dealt with Hidan and removed him from the fight by bringing him to the location where his trap was already set up. Kakashi continued to fight Kakuzu 1 on 1, got his ass handed to him and was about to have his heart literally ripped right out of his chest right before Shikamaru saved him by tricking Hidan into using Kakuzu\u2019s blood in his ritual. I know how the fight went buddy, but you calling Kakuzu fodder just shows how ignorant you actually are lmfao. \u201cA supposed high level nin getting snuck up on\u201d didn\u2019t I already explain to you that sneaking up on your opponent while their guard is down has been shown to be extremely effective against the most powerful of opponents through the entire series?

Damn son you salty af right now. Throwing out insults. Being caught off guard is the very essence of speed blitz. You need to provide me with a definition of sneak attacks being excluded.\n\n>No, I\u2019m not wrong. He never fought Hidan and Kakuzu at the same time,\n\nYes, yes you are. You can say he didn't all you want, but Kakashi fought them both. If you'd have watched the video you'd know this.\n\n>but you calling Kakuzu fodder just shows how ignorant you actually are lmfao.\n\nHe is fodder. He lost to a fatigued Naruto and his barely functioning Rasenshuriken.\n\n>didn\u2019t I already explain to you that sneaking up on your opponent while their guard is down has been shown to be extremely effective against the most powerful of opponents through the entire series? \n\nYeah, and it shouldn't happen to high-level ninjas unless I don't know, that Ninja is facing someone strong? Like Kakashi. Someone who is stronger than Kakazu. And Faster. Which is why he got blitzed. Anyways have a good day stranger. I won't respond to whatever dribble you post next because it'll probably be more angry upset dribble that is laughably incorrect. \n\ntl:dr Kakazu sucks",

You probably live a very sheltered life and have never even been punched in the face let alone been in an actual fight so I\u2019ll give you a little bit of information when it comes to this stuff, being aware of your surroundings makes a huge difference in a fight. This is why there is a clear cut difference between a speed blitz and a sneak attack, on one hand you\u2019re aware of the fact that you\u2019re actually in a fight and have an opponent but your opponent is so fast you\u2019re incapable of reacting to them. On the other hand you\u2019re completely unaware of the fact that you even have an opponent in the first place and get snuck up on. Though I\u2019m probably wasting my time as you already have trouble distinguishing between these two things and will likely continue to be ignorant to the facts even after they\u2019re explained in simple enough terms for you to understand. \n\nI love how all you can do is throw out insults, then play victim and simply ignore facts. But then again, ignorance is bliss. \n\nAlso\u2026 it\u2019s drivel, not dribble\ud83d\udc80",

When Mifune and Hanzo meet again in the 4th Ninja War, Mifune is stronger than before.\n\nSince Mifune and the Sannin never interact, we can apply ABC logic here.

Naruto was stronger than Sasuke when Sasuke left, which only further proves my point. He not only didn't bother to summon chief toad against him, he also was too petty to go for the win during their clash and sliced his forehead instead of aiming for his body to take the win. But again, even if Naruto had won, *nothing* would've stopped Sasuke from leaving. You can't make people stay if they don't want to. It's just not happening, regardless how much stronger someone is. Sasuke was weaker than Naruto and still left. It would take Sasuke to have a change in heart to stay, just like Oro.\n\nIt's you who doesn't understand how being OP works. You don't just label anybody you think is strong \"OP\". That's just not how that fucking works. You can't have a dozen people who are all relative to each other and say they're all OP. No. Again, going by your logic, many more characters are \"OP\" just for being strong, like Tsunade or Hiruzen, or even Kakashi. Not at all how that works. But, since it's all relative to you, Guy, Jiraiya, Kakashi, Tsunde, Oro, Itachi, Kisame, Hiruzen, Gaara, Naruto, Sasuke, etc are all OP for just being a lot stronger than those around them. Hell, even Zabuza who's killed how many people already? You know that saying, \"if everyone is special, then no one is special\"? Yeah, same shit applies here.\n\nItachi wouldn't just be \"running from Kakashi\", he'd be running from Kakashi, Guy, and Kurenai. There is no excuse for him running from Jiraiya unless he was weaker than him, especially not when it's a 2v1 with Kisame. He literally let Naruto go, the kid he came to the leaf for to begin with, just to run from Jiraiya.\n\nAll I could say is just agree to disagree.

Hell this is the whole reason he was so harsh on new recruits as a teacher. He kept to himself. It's also why he never dates. Again as he keeps to himself. He barely had friends and family. He respected his coworkers enough to emotional about it but not the same level as an entire extended family you all knew personally. Who Sasuke had go watch all get buried too. The numbers Kakashi buried were not personal. And no I didnt say that Tsukiyomi is the only comparable place. That's something you're making up lol\n\nTalking about what they physically had to go through I'd say is equal. What Orochimaru makes him go through more than makes up for a decade of shit so I agree with you there. Also dont get me started on how traumatic that shit is lol he was twisted for good reasons. \n\nIt isn't physical at all. Which is why Sasuke though exhausted isn't seen as damaged in anyway after their fight in shippuden. Hell they even go through quite a bit in genjutsu and neither are wounded. It is not physical. Never have been.  (They even explain it isnt so please drop it. Reiterating the facts is annoying. Even IT isnt physical. Like really dude dont...) \n\nAnd yeah it could be a lifetime which is why the amount of shit Sasuke went through in Tsukiyomi was greater. He sees more. Period. Its stated multiple times what they all went through. And hell 8 yrs old Sasuke (yes 8 which again means he went though much worse than ADULT Kakashi did in Tsukiyomi) isnt the only time he goes through it. He did get put in it in more times than Kakashi too in just about every meet up they had. \n\nRight and how did that help Sasuke exactly? They had one talk and one training session and that amounted to Sasuke just leaving. He wasnt fixed. His therapy lasted one session that didnt help. So in reality, neither did Sasuke. It would be the equivalent of starting therapy then leaving and saying you're cured. What you're doing makes no sense as an argument.  And technically yeah Guy helped him quite a bit which is why Kakashi wasnt a top root agent hell bent on destruction. He had someone snap him out of it. Go back and review their pasts, Kakashi was on the same path and had someone actually help him before it was too late. Sasuke had this but he ended up leaving before the help could reach him. The help was missing context (which is thematically why Naruto loss btw) \n\nRight which is less than Sasuke. His sensei and squad are what made him shut shit down and then with the exception of Guy cutting in at every chance Kakashi had no one close to him afterwards. He went through less. It's actually hilarious as you number what he went through and then say he went through more when the math doesnt add up.",

Its based on signals sent to and from the brain people have used certain mental methods to kill people purely based off their perception and pain can be felt without being damaged in those areas. Tsukuyomi literally made his body experience the pain of being stabbed over and over for ages. Again we also dont know how long.\n\nI also never said he went through more he went through sht comparable to Sasuke. Your nonsense doesnt negate that. He is a shinobi that has seen thousands and thousands of bodies pile up at his feet. He is a man who has been through hell and back and the fact that you act like Sasuke has been through an incomparable hell when the majority of his trauma is a singular event thay haunted him is ridiculous. That single even was massive and while Kakashis events were much smaller they add up quite a bit when its your every day life for over a decade. Hell Sasuke didnt even live with his torment as long. Im not saying he hasnt been through hell either. Id put them on equal ground and you even make good points but to act like Sasuke is leagues more traumatized than a 2 time war veteran is ridiculous.",

Canonically, the reanimation jutsu revives people in their prime, but they have all their memories up to their death regardless of what their prime may be. This was stated by Kabuto, who perfected the jutsu after Orochimaru. Orochimaru observed Kabuto's use of the jutsu and was able to replicate it himself just fine with no effort. However, that's very abstract and we doubt that the jutsu does this automatically. Our theory is that the jutsu revives the person at whatever the caster personally considers to be that person's prime, whether intentionally or unconsciously. Orochimaru was the one who revived the hokage, not Kabuto. Based on that, it makes sense that Orochimaru would consider old man Hiruzen as being \"prime.\" For one, Orochimaru values knowledge over all else, evidenced by his all consuming quest to learn every jutsu known to man and then further create more. Hiruzen was known as \"The Professor\" because he supposedly knew and could proficiently use every single jutsu known to the leaf village that wasn't dependent on kekkei genkai, and could also use all 5 nature transformations. It's heavily implied that he was outside of his physical prime when he completed this knowledge base of his, and so Orochimaru likely considers his older form to be the prime of his knowledge. But beyond that, far more importantly, Orochimaru got absolutely fucking *bodied* by Lord Hiruzen. He had the reanimation a of Lord First and Lord Second doing most of the work for him and Hiruzen still not only kept up, but destroyed the reanimations and ripped out Orochimaru's arms/the soul of his arms. If it weren't for that sword which has the uniquely specific ability to float and be controlled with mere hand motions, Orochimaru would have died. And if he didn't have Lord First and Lord Second, he would've gotten completely destroyed by Hiruzen without the need for the Reaper Death Seal. My friends and I genuinely believe that Lord Hiruzen put the fucking fear of god into Orochimaru that day and ever since he's considered old man Hiruzen to be the highest prime of Lord Third.\n\nTL:DR - Hiruzen gave Orochimaru extreme PTSD and as such Orochimaru unconsciously considered old man Hiruzen to be \"prime\" when he was reviving the hokage",

Kakashi continued to fight Kakuzu 1 on 1, got his ass handed to him and was about to have his heart literally ripped right out of his chest right before Shikamaru saved him by tricking Hidan into using Kakuzu\u2019s blood in his ritual.

On the other hand you\u2019re completely unaware of the fact that you even have an opponent in the first place and get snuck up on.

When Mifune and Hanzo meet again in the 4th Ninja War, Mifune is stronger than before.\n\nSince Mifune and the Sannin never interact, we can apply ABC logic here. Hanzo is stronger than the Sannin and Mifune is pretty much his equal, so Mifune, (in theory) is stronger than them as well.",

He was just *relative* to him.\n\nItachi was *strong* relative to everyone around him. Not OP. Gaara had killed countless grown men by the time of the chuunin exams, regardless if he could beat Guy or not, he was just OP in p1 going by your logic.\n\nItachi wasn't OP. No one from p1 is. Closest to it is Guy. \n\nIf it was only relative, then who's OP and who isn't constantly changes. Now that the entire Naruto show is done, in comparison to everyone in the show, he's not OP. At all. Just strong. You compare him to the entire verse, not just characters that are on-screen at the time. Pain existed during this time. So did Obito. It'd be reasonable to consider him OP if the show ended at the end of p1, but obviously that didn't happen, and we know what actual OP characters are. Pain was OP, compared to the entirety of the verse, Pain was literally one of the strongest people alive on the planet. \n\nIt simply doesn't make sense to consider someone who can be rivaled by a dozen people as OP. He isn't.",

Leaving is not that evidence. Naruto was stronger than Sasuke when Sasuke left, which only further proves my point. He not only didn't bother to summon chief toad against him, he also was too petty to go for the win during their clash and sliced his forehead instead of aiming for his body to take the win. But again, even if Naruto had won, *nothing* would've stopped Sasuke from leaving. You can't make people stay if they don't want to. It's just not happening, regardless how much stronger someone is. Sasuke was weaker than Naruto and still left. It would take Sasuke to have a change in heart to stay, just like Oro.\n\nIt's you who doesn't understand how being OP works. You don't just label anybody you think is strong \"OP\". That's just not how that fucking works. You can't have a dozen people who are all relative to each other and say they're all OP. No. Again, going by your logic, many more characters are \"OP\" just for being strong, like Tsunade or Hiruzen, or even Kakashi. Not at all how that works. But, since it's all relative to you, Guy, Jiraiya, Kakashi, Tsunde, Oro, Itachi, Kisame, Hiruzen, Gaara, Naruto, Sasuke, etc are all OP for just being a lot stronger than those around them. Hell, even Zabuza who's killed how many people already? You know that saying, \"if everyone is special, then no one is special\"? Yeah, same shit applies here.\n\nItachi wouldn't just be \"running from Kakashi\", he'd be running from Kakashi, Guy, and Kurenai. There is no excuse for him running from Jiraiya unless he was weaker than him, especially not when it's a 2v1 with Kisame. He literally let Naruto go, the kid he came to the leaf for to begin with, just to run from Jiraiya.\n\nAll I could say is just agree to disagree. This ain't going anywhere and I'm not gonna keep repeating myself.",

Hell this is the whole reason he was so harsh on new recruits as a teacher. He kept to himself. It's also why he never dates. Again as he keeps to himself. He barely had friends and family. He respected his coworkers enough to emotional about it but not the same level as an entire extended family you all knew personally. Who Sasuke had go watch all get buried too. The numbers Kakashi buried were not personal. And no I didnt say that Tsukiyomi is the only comparable place. That's something you're making up lol\n\nTalking about what they physically had to go through I'd say is equal. What Orochimaru makes him go through more than makes up for a decade of shit so I agree with you there. Also dont get me started on how traumatic that shit is lol he was twisted for good reasons. \n\nIt isn't physical at all. Which is why Sasuke though exhausted isn't seen as damaged in anyway after their fight in shippuden. Hell they even go through quite a bit in genjutsu and neither are wounded. It is not physical. Never have been.  (They even explain it isnt so please drop it. Reiterating the facts is annoying. Even IT isnt physical. Like really dude dont...) \n\nAnd yeah it could be a lifetime which is why the amount of shit Sasuke went through in Tsukiyomi was greater. He sees more. Period. Its stated multiple times what they all went through. And hell 8 yrs old Sasuke (yes 8 which again means he went though much worse than ADULT Kakashi did in Tsukiyomi) isnt the only time he goes through it. He did get put in it in more times than Kakashi too in just about every meet up they had. \n\nRight and how did that help Sasuke exactly? They had one talk and one training session and that amounted to Sasuke just leaving. He wasnt fixed. His therapy lasted one session that didnt help. So in reality, neither did Sasuke. It would be the equivalent of starting therapy then leaving and saying you're cured. What you're doing makes no sense as an argument.  And technically yeah Guy helped him quite a bit which is why Kakashi wasnt a top root agent hell bent on destruction. He had someone snap him out of it. Go back and review their pasts, Kakashi was on the same path and had someone actually help him before it was too late. Sasuke had this but he ended up leaving before the help could reach him. The help was missing context (which is thematically why Naruto loss btw) \n\nRight which is less than Sasuke. His sensei and squad are what made him shut shit down and then with the exception of Guy cutting in at every chance Kakashi had no one close to him afterwards. He went through less. It's actually hilarious as you number what he went through and then say he went through more when the math doesnt add up.",

Its based on signals sent to and from the brain people have used certain mental methods to kill people purely based off their perception and pain can be felt without being damaged in those areas. Tsukuyomi literally made his body experience the pain of being stabbed over and over for ages. Again we also dont know how long.\n\nI also never said he went through more he went through sht comparable to Sasuke. Your nonsense doesnt negate that. He is a shinobi that has seen thousands and thousands of bodies pile up at his feet. He is a man who has been through hell and back and the fact that you act like Sasuke has been through an incomparable hell when the majority of his trauma is a singular event thay haunted him is ridiculous. That single even was massive and while Kakashis events were much smaller they add up quite a bit when its your every day life for over a decade. Hell Sasuke didnt even live with his torment as long. Im not saying he hasnt been through hell either. Id put them on equal ground and you even make good points but to act like Sasuke is leagues more traumatized than a 2 time war veteran is ridiculous.",

Canonically, the reanimation jutsu revives people in their prime, but they have all their memories up to their death regardless of what their prime may be. This was stated by Kabuto, who perfected the jutsu after Orochimaru. Orochimaru observed Kabuto's use of the jutsu and was able to replicate it himself just fine with no effort. However, that's very abstract and we doubt that the jutsu does this automatically. Our theory is that the jutsu revives the person at whatever the caster personally considers to be that person's prime, whether intentionally or unconsciously. Orochimaru was the one who revived the hokage, not Kabuto. Based on that, it makes sense that Orochimaru would consider old man Hiruzen as being \"prime.\" For one, Orochimaru values knowledge over all else, evidenced by his all consuming quest to learn every jutsu known to man and then further create more. Hiruzen was known as \"The Professor\" because he supposedly knew and could proficiently use every single jutsu known to the leaf village that wasn't dependent on kekkei genkai, and could also use all 5 nature transformations. It's heavily implied that he was outside of his physical prime when he completed this knowledge base of his, and so Orochimaru likely considers his older form to be the prime of his knowledge. But beyond that, far more importantly, Orochimaru got absolutely fucking *bodied* by Lord Hiruzen. He had the reanimation a of Lord First and Lord Second doing most of the work for him and Hiruzen still not only kept up, but destroyed the reanimations and ripped out Orochimaru's arms/the soul of his arms. If it weren't for that sword which has the uniquely specific ability to float and be controlled with mere hand motions, Orochimaru would have died. And if he didn't have Lord First and Lord Second, he would've gotten completely destroyed by Hiruzen without the need for the Reaper Death Seal. My friends and I genuinely believe that Lord Hiruzen put the fucking fear of god into Orochimaru that day and ever since he's considered old man Hiruzen to be the highest prime of Lord Third.\n\nTL:DR - Hiruzen gave Orochimaru extreme PTSD and as such Orochimaru unconsciously considered old man Hiruzen to be \"prime\" when he was reviving the hokage",

He never fought Hidan and Kakuzu at the same time, when he fought Hidan It was Shikamaru, Choji and Ino trying their best to hold off Kakuzu but getting their assess handed to them. Then Kakuzu\u2019s hearts got involved with Kakashi\u2019s fight so he dealt with Hidan by tricking him with a shadow clone and moved on to Kakuzu, then while Kakashi was fighting Kakuzu, AND ONLY Kakuzu, Shikamaru dealt with Hidan and removed him from the fight by bringing him to the location where his trap was already set up. Kakashi continued to fight Kakuzu 1 on 1, got his ass handed to him and was about to have his heart literally ripped right out of his chest right before Shikamaru saved him by tricking Hidan into using Kakuzu\u2019s blood in his ritual. I know how the fight went buddy, but you calling Kakuzu fodder just shows how ignorant you actually are lmfao. \u201cA supposed high level nin getting snuck up on\u201d didn\u2019t I already explain to you that sneaking up on your opponent while their guard is down has been shown to be extremely effective against the most powerful of opponents through the entire series?

Like Kakashi. Someone who is stronger than Kakazu. And Faster. Which is why he got blitzed. Anyways have a good day stranger.

You probably live a very sheltered life and have never even been punched in the face let alone been in an actual fight so I\u2019ll give you a little bit of information when it comes to this stuff, being aware of your surroundings makes a huge difference in a fight. This is why there is a clear cut difference between a speed blitz and a sneak attack, on one hand you\u2019re aware of the fact that you\u2019re actually in a fight and have an opponent but your opponent is so fast you\u2019re incapable of reacting to them. On the other hand you\u2019re completely unaware of the fact that you even have an opponent in the first place and get snuck up on. Though I\u2019m probably wasting my time as you already have trouble distinguishing between these two things and will likely continue to be ignorant to the facts even after they\u2019re explained in simple enough terms for you to understand. \n\nI love how all you can do is throw out insults, then play victim and simply ignore facts. But then again, ignorance is bliss. \n\nAlso\u2026 it\u2019s drivel, not dribble\ud83d\udc80",

Leaving is not that evidence. Naruto was stronger than Sasuke when Sasuke left, which only further proves my point. He not only didn't bother to summon chief toad against him, he also was too petty to go for the win during their clash and sliced his forehead instead of aiming for his body to take the win. But again, even if Naruto had won, *nothing* would've stopped Sasuke from leaving. You can't make people stay if they don't want to. It's just not happening, regardless how much stronger someone is. Sasuke was weaker than Naruto and still left. It would take Sasuke to have a change in heart to stay, just like Oro.\n\nIt's you who doesn't understand how being OP works. You don't just label anybody you think is strong \"OP\". That's just not how that fucking works. You can't have a dozen people who are all relative to each other and say they're all OP. No. Again, going by your logic, many more characters are \"OP\" just for being strong, like Tsunade or Hiruzen, or even Kakashi. Not at all how that works. But, since it's all relative to you, Guy, Jiraiya, Kakashi, Tsunde, Oro, Itachi, Kisame, Hiruzen, Gaara, Naruto, Sasuke, etc are all OP for just being a lot stronger than those around them. Hell, even Zabuza who's killed how many people already? You know that saying, \"if everyone is special, then no one is special\"? Yeah, same shit applies here.\n\nItachi wouldn't just be \"running from Kakashi\", he'd be running from Kakashi, Guy, and Kurenai. There is no excuse for him running from Jiraiya unless he was weaker than him, especially not when it's a 2v1 with Kisame. He literally let Naruto go, the kid he came to the leaf for to begin with, just to run from Jiraiya.\n\nAll I could say is just agree to disagree.

Its based on signals sent to and from the brain people have used certain mental methods to kill people purely based off their perception and pain can be felt without being damaged in those areas. Tsukuyomi literally made his body experience the pain of being stabbed over and over for ages. Again we also dont know how long.\n\nI also never said he went through more he went through sht comparable to Sasuke. Your nonsense doesnt negate that. He is a shinobi that has seen thousands and thousands of bodies pile up at his feet. He is a man who has been through hell and back and the fact that you act like Sasuke has been through an incomparable hell when the majority of his trauma is a singular event thay haunted him is ridiculous. That single even was massive and while Kakashis events were much smaller they add up quite a bit when its your every day life for over a decade. Hell Sasuke didnt even live with his torment as long. Im not saying he hasnt been through hell either. Id put them on equal ground and you even make good points but to act like Sasuke is leagues more traumatized than a 2 time war veteran is ridiculous.",

                            "body": "My friends and I compiled something of a theory about that. Canonically, the reanimation jutsu revives people in their prime, but they have all their memories up to their death regardless of what their prime may be. This was stated by Kabuto, who perfected the jutsu after Orochimaru. Orochimaru observed Kabuto's use of the jutsu and was able to replicate it himself just fine with no effort. However, that's very abstract and we doubt that the jutsu does this automatically. Our theory is that the jutsu revives the person at whatever the caster personally considers to be that person's prime, whether intentionally or unconsciously. Orochimaru was the one who revived the hokage, not Kabuto. Based on that, it makes sense that Orochimaru would consider old man Hiruzen as being \"prime.\" For one, Orochimaru values knowledge over all else, evidenced by his all consuming quest to learn every jutsu known to man and then further create more. Hiruzen was known as \"The Professor\" because he supposedly knew and could proficiently use every single jutsu known to the leaf village that wasn't dependent on kekkei genkai, and could also use all 5 nature transformations. It's heavily implied that he was outside of his physical prime when he completed this knowledge base of his, and so Orochimaru likely considers his older form to be the prime of his knowledge. But beyond that, far more importantly, Orochimaru got absolutely fucking *bodied* by Lord Hiruzen. He had the reanimation a of Lord First and Lord Second doing most of the work for him and Hiruzen still not only kept up, but destroyed the reanimations and ripped out Orochimaru's arms/the soul of his arms. If it weren't for that sword which has the uniquely specific ability to float and be controlled with mere hand motions, Orochimaru would have died. And if he didn't have Lord First and Lord Second, he would've gotten completely destroyed by Hiruzen without the need for the Reaper Death Seal. My friends and I genuinely believe that Lord Hiruzen put the fucking fear of god into Orochimaru that day and ever since he's considered old man Hiruzen to be the highest prime of Lord Third.\n\nTL:DR - Hiruzen gave Orochimaru extreme PTSD and as such Orochimaru unconsciously considered old man Hiruzen to be \"prime\" when he was reviving the hokage",

Kakashi continued to fight Kakuzu 1 on 1, got his ass handed to him and was about to have his heart literally ripped right out of his chest right before Shikamaru saved him by tricking Hidan into using Kakuzu\u2019s blood in his ritual.

On the other hand you\u2019re completely unaware of the fact that you even have an opponent in the first place and get snuck up on.

Just strong. You compare him to the entire verse, not just characters that are on-screen at the time. Pain existed during this time. So did Obito. It'd be reasonable to consider him OP if the show ended at the end of p1, but obviously that didn't happen, and we know what actual OP characters are.

Leaving is not that evidence. Naruto was stronger than Sasuke when Sasuke left, which only further proves my point. He not only didn't bother to summon chief toad against him, he also was too petty to go for the win during their clash and sliced his forehead instead of aiming for his body to take the win. But again, even if Naruto had won, *nothing* would've stopped Sasuke from leaving. You can't make people stay if they don't want to. It's just not happening, regardless how much stronger someone is. Sasuke was weaker than Naruto and still left. It would take Sasuke to have a change in heart to stay, just like Oro.\n\nIt's you who doesn't understand how being OP works. You don't just label anybody you think is strong \"OP\". That's just not how that fucking works. You can't have a dozen people who are all relative to each other and say they're all OP. No. Again, going by your logic, many more characters are \"OP\" just for being strong, like Tsunade or Hiruzen, or even Kakashi. Not at all how that works. But, since it's all relative to you, Guy, Jiraiya, Kakashi, Tsunde, Oro, Itachi, Kisame, Hiruzen, Gaara, Naruto, Sasuke, etc are all OP for just being a lot stronger than those around them. Hell, even Zabuza who's killed how many people already? You know that saying, \"if everyone is special, then no one is special\"? Yeah, same shit applies here.\n\nItachi wouldn't just be \"running from Kakashi\", he'd be running from Kakashi, Guy, and Kurenai. There is no excuse for him running from Jiraiya unless he was weaker than him, especially not when it's a 2v1 with Kisame. He literally let Naruto go, the kid he came to the leaf for to begin with, just to run from Jiraiya.\n\nAll I could say is just agree to disagree. This ain't going anywhere and I'm not gonna keep repeating myself.",

                    "body": "My friends and I compiled something of a theory about that. Canonically, the reanimation jutsu revives people in their prime, but they have all their memories up to their death regardless of what their prime may be. This was stated by Kabuto, who perfected the jutsu after Orochimaru. Orochimaru observed Kabuto's use of the jutsu and was able to replicate it himself just fine with no effort. However, that's very abstract and we doubt that the jutsu does this automatically. Our theory is that the jutsu revives the person at whatever the caster personally considers to be that person's prime, whether intentionally or unconsciously. Orochimaru was the one who revived the hokage, not Kabuto. Based on that, it makes sense that Orochimaru would consider old man Hiruzen as being \"prime.\" For one, Orochimaru values knowledge over all else, evidenced by his all consuming quest to learn every jutsu known to man and then further create more. Hiruzen was known as \"The Professor\" because he supposedly knew and could proficiently use every single jutsu known to the leaf village that wasn't dependent on kekkei genkai, and could also use all 5 nature transformations. It's heavily implied that he was outside of his physical prime when he completed this knowledge base of his, and so Orochimaru likely considers his older form to be the prime of his knowledge. But beyond that, far more importantly, Orochimaru got absolutely fucking *bodied* by Lord Hiruzen. He had the reanimation a of Lord First and Lord Second doing most of the work for him and Hiruzen still not only kept up, but destroyed the reanimations and ripped out Orochimaru's arms/the soul of his arms. If it weren't for that sword which has the uniquely specific ability to float and be controlled with mere hand motions, Orochimaru would have died. And if he didn't have Lord First and Lord Second, he would've gotten completely destroyed by Hiruzen without the need for the Reaper Death Seal. My friends and I genuinely believe that Lord Hiruzen put the fucking fear of god into Orochimaru that day and ever since he's considered old man Hiruzen to be the highest prime of Lord Third.\n\nTL:DR - Hiruzen gave Orochimaru extreme PTSD and as such Orochimaru unconsciously considered old man Hiruzen to be \"prime\" when he was reviving the hokage",

Kakashi continued to fight Kakuzu 1 on 1, got his ass handed to him and was about to have his heart literally ripped right out of his chest right before Shikamaru saved him by tricking Hidan into using Kakuzu\u2019s blood in his ritual.

You probably live a very sheltered life and have never even been punched in the face let alone been in an actual fight so I\u2019ll give you a little bit of information when it comes to this stuff, being aware of your surroundings makes a huge difference in a fight.

On the other hand you\u2019re completely unaware of the fact that you even have an opponent in the first place and get snuck up on.

He was just *relative* to him.\n\nItachi was *strong* relative to everyone around him. Not OP. Gaara had killed countless grown men by the time of the chuunin exams, regardless if he could beat Guy or not, he was just OP in p1 going by your logic.\n\nItachi wasn't OP. No one from p1 is. Closest to it is Guy. \n\nIf it was only relative, then who's OP and who isn't constantly changes. Now that the entire Naruto show is done, in comparison to everyone in the show, he's not OP. At all. Just strong. You compare him to the entire verse, not just characters that are on-screen at the time. Pain existed during this time. So did Obito. It'd be reasonable to consider him OP if the show ended at the end of p1, but obviously that didn't happen, and we know what actual OP characters are. Pain was OP, compared to the entirety of the verse, Pain was literally one of the strongest people alive on the planet. \n\nIt simply doesn't make sense to consider someone who can be rivaled by a dozen people as OP.

Leaving is not that evidence. Naruto was stronger than Sasuke when Sasuke left, which only further proves my point. He not only didn't bother to summon chief toad against him, he also was too petty to go for the win during their clash and sliced his forehead instead of aiming for his body to take the win. But again, even if Naruto had won, *nothing* would've stopped Sasuke from leaving. You can't make people stay if they don't want to. It's just not happening, regardless how much stronger someone is. Sasuke was weaker than Naruto and still left. It would take Sasuke to have a change in heart to stay, just like Oro.\n\nIt's you who doesn't understand how being OP works. You don't just label anybody you think is strong \"OP\". That's just not how that fucking works. You can't have a dozen people who are all relative to each other and say they're all OP. No. Again, going by your logic, many more characters are \"OP\" just for being strong, like Tsunade or Hiruzen, or even Kakashi. Not at all how that works. But, since it's all relative to you, Guy, Jiraiya, Kakashi, Tsunde, Oro, Itachi, Kisame, Hiruzen, Gaara, Naruto, Sasuke, etc are all OP for just being a lot stronger than those around them. Hell, even Zabuza who's killed how many people already? You know that saying, \"if everyone is special, then no one is special\"? Yeah, same shit applies here.\n\nItachi wouldn't just be \"running from Kakashi\", he'd be running from Kakashi, Guy, and Kurenai. There is no excuse for him running from Jiraiya unless he was weaker than him, especially not when it's a 2v1 with Kisame. He literally let Naruto go, the kid he came to the leaf for to begin with, just to run from Jiraiya.\n\nAll I could say is just agree to disagree. This ain't going anywhere and I'm not gonna keep repeating myself.",

Itachi was a double agent and did not want to actually capture Naruto. \n\nRunning against Jiraiya was a valid excuse Kisame would buy. \n\n\nYou do not know what OP means. It is relative. Naruto is OP in the Naruto verse. Place him in the DB verse and he\u2019s no longer OP.

            "body": "My friends and I compiled something of a theory about that. Canonically, the reanimation jutsu revives people in their prime, but they have all their memories up to their death regardless of what their prime may be. This was stated by Kabuto, who perfected the jutsu after Orochimaru. Orochimaru observed Kabuto's use of the jutsu and was able to replicate it himself just fine with no effort. However, that's very abstract and we doubt that the jutsu does this automatically. Our theory is that the jutsu revives the person at whatever the caster personally considers to be that person's prime, whether intentionally or unconsciously. Orochimaru was the one who revived the hokage, not Kabuto. Based on that, it makes sense that Orochimaru would consider old man Hiruzen as being \"prime.\" For one, Orochimaru values knowledge over all else, evidenced by his all consuming quest to learn every jutsu known to man and then further create more. Hiruzen was known as \"The Professor\" because he supposedly knew and could proficiently use every single jutsu known to the leaf village that wasn't dependent on kekkei genkai, and could also use all 5 nature transformations. It's heavily implied that he was outside of his physical prime when he completed this knowledge base of his, and so Orochimaru likely considers his older form to be the prime of his knowledge. But beyond that, far more importantly, Orochimaru got absolutely fucking *bodied* by Lord Hiruzen. He had the reanimation a of Lord First and Lord Second doing most of the work for him and Hiruzen still not only kept up, but destroyed the reanimations and ripped out Orochimaru's arms/the soul of his arms. If it weren't for that sword which has the uniquely specific ability to float and be controlled with mere hand motions, Orochimaru would have died. And if he didn't have Lord First and Lord Second, he would've gotten completely destroyed by Hiruzen without the need for the Reaper Death Seal. My friends and I genuinely believe that Lord Hiruzen put the fucking fear of god into Orochimaru that day and ever since he's considered old man Hiruzen to be the highest prime of Lord Third.\n\nTL:DR - Hiruzen gave Orochimaru extreme PTSD and as such Orochimaru unconsciously considered old man Hiruzen to be \"prime\" when he was reviving the hokage",

Go watch the fight. Stop being a baby and accept that you are wrong lmao. They even use a tagteam manuever against Kakashi lmao. Kakazu fanboys trip me out. I hope to god you aren't one of those that thinks Kakazu beats Pain. Please, please don't be one of those.",

He never fought Hidan and Kakuzu at the same time, when he fought Hidan It was Shikamaru, Choji and Ino trying their best to hold off Kakuzu but getting their assess handed to them. Then Kakuzu\u2019s hearts got involved with Kakashi\u2019s fight so he dealt with Hidan by tricking him with a shadow clone and moved on to Kakuzu, then while Kakashi was fighting Kakuzu, AND ONLY Kakuzu, Shikamaru dealt with Hidan and removed him from the fight by bringing him to the location where his trap was already set up. Kakashi continued to fight Kakuzu 1 on 1, got his ass handed to him and was about to have his heart literally ripped right out of his chest right before Shikamaru saved him by tricking Hidan into using Kakuzu\u2019s blood in his ritual. I know how the fight went buddy, but you calling Kakuzu fodder just shows how ignorant you actually are lmfao. \u201cA supposed high level nin getting snuck up on\u201d didn\u2019t I already explain to you that sneaking up on your opponent while their guard is down has been shown to be extremely effective against the most powerful of opponents through the entire series? Meanwhile Isshiki who is literally the strongest character we\u2019ve seen to date has been snuck up on more than once\ud83d\udc80",

Damn son you salty af right now. Throwing out insults. Being caught off guard is the very essence of speed blitz. You need to provide me with a definition of sneak attacks being excluded.\n\n>No, I\u2019m not wrong. He never fought Hidan and Kakuzu at the same time,\n\nYes, yes you are. You can say he didn't all you want, but Kakashi fought them both. If you'd have watched the video you'd know this.\n\n>but you calling Kakuzu fodder just shows how ignorant you actually are lmfao.\n\nHe is fodder. He lost to a fatigued Naruto and his barely functioning Rasenshuriken.\n\n>didn\u2019t I already explain to you that sneaking up on your opponent while their guard is down has been shown to be extremely effective against the most powerful of opponents through the entire series? \n\nYeah, and it shouldn't happen to high-level ninjas unless I don't know, that Ninja is facing someone strong? Like Kakashi. Someone who is stronger than Kakazu. And Faster. Which is why he got blitzed. Anyways have a good day stranger. I won't respond to whatever dribble you post next because it'll probably be more angry upset dribble that is laughably incorrect. \n\ntl:dr Kakazu sucks",

You probably live a very sheltered life and have never even been punched in the face let alone been in an actual fight so I\u2019ll give you a little bit of information when it comes to this stuff, being aware of your surroundings makes a huge difference in a fight. This is why there is a clear cut difference between a speed blitz and a sneak attack, on one hand you\u2019re aware of the fact that you\u2019re actually in a fight and have an opponent but your opponent is so fast you\u2019re incapable of reacting to them. On the other hand you\u2019re completely unaware of the fact that you even have an opponent in the first place and get snuck up on. Though I\u2019m probably wasting my time as you already have trouble distinguishing between these two things and will likely continue to be ignorant to the facts even after they\u2019re explained in simple enough terms for you to understand. \n\nI love how all you can do is throw out insults, then play victim and simply ignore facts. But then again, ignorance is bliss. \n\nAlso\u2026 it\u2019s drivel, not dribble\ud83d\udc80",

He was just *relative* to him.\n\nItachi was *strong* relative to everyone around him. Not OP. Gaara had killed countless grown men by the time of the chuunin exams, regardless if he could beat Guy or not, he was just OP in p1 going by your logic.\n\nItachi wasn't OP. No one from p1 is. Closest to it is Guy. \n\nIf it was only relative, then who's OP and who isn't constantly changes. Now that the entire Naruto show is done, in comparison to everyone in the show, he's not OP. At all. Just strong. You compare him to the entire verse, not just characters that are on-screen at the time. Pain existed during this time. So did Obito. It'd be reasonable to consider him OP if the show ended at the end of p1, but obviously that didn't happen, and we know what actual OP characters are. Pain was OP, compared to the entirety of the verse, Pain was literally one of the strongest people alive on the planet. \n\nIt simply doesn't make sense to consider someone who can be rivaled by a dozen people as OP.

Naruto was stronger than Sasuke when Sasuke left, which only further proves my point. He not only didn't bother to summon chief toad against him, he also was too petty to go for the win during their clash and sliced his forehead instead of aiming for his body to take the win. But again, even if Naruto had won, *nothing* would've stopped Sasuke from leaving. You can't make people stay if they don't want to. It's just not happening, regardless how much stronger someone is. Sasuke was weaker than Naruto and still left. It would take Sasuke to have a change in heart to stay, just like Oro.\n\nIt's you who doesn't understand how being OP works. You don't just label anybody you think is strong \"OP\". That's just not how that fucking works. You can't have a dozen people who are all relative to each other and say they're all OP. No. Again, going by your logic, many more characters are \"OP\" just for being strong, like Tsunade or Hiruzen, or even Kakashi. Not at all how that works. But, since it's all relative to you, Guy, Jiraiya, Kakashi, Tsunde, Oro, Itachi, Kisame, Hiruzen, Gaara, Naruto, Sasuke, etc are all OP for just being a lot stronger than those around them. Hell, even Zabuza who's killed how many people already? You know that saying, \"if everyone is special, then no one is special\"? Yeah, same shit applies here.\n\nItachi wouldn't just be \"running from Kakashi\", he'd be running from Kakashi, Guy, and Kurenai. There is no excuse for him running from Jiraiya unless he was weaker than him, especially not when it's a 2v1 with Kisame. He literally let Naruto go, the kid he came to the leaf for to begin with, just to run from Jiraiya.\n\nAll I could say is just agree to disagree. This ain't going anywhere and I'm not gonna keep repeating myself.",

He never fought Hidan and Kakuzu at the same time, when he fought Hidan It was Shikamaru, Choji and Ino trying their best to hold off Kakuzu but getting their assess handed to them. Then Kakuzu\u2019s hearts got involved with Kakashi\u2019s fight so he dealt with Hidan by tricking him with a shadow clone and moved on to Kakuzu, then while Kakashi was fighting Kakuzu, AND ONLY Kakuzu, Shikamaru dealt with Hidan and removed him from the fight by bringing him to the location where his trap was already set up. Kakashi continued to fight Kakuzu 1 on 1, got his ass handed to him and was about to have his heart literally ripped right out of his chest right before Shikamaru saved him by tricking Hidan into using Kakuzu\u2019s blood in his ritual. I know how the fight went buddy, but you calling Kakuzu fodder just shows how ignorant you actually are lmfao. \u201cA supposed high level nin getting snuck up on\u201d didn\u2019t I already explain to you that sneaking up on your opponent while their guard is down has been shown to be extremely effective against the most powerful of opponents through the entire series?

You need to provide me with a definition of sneak attacks being excluded.\n\n>No, I\u2019m not wrong. He never fought Hidan and Kakuzu at the same time,\n\nYes, yes you are. You can say he didn't all you want, but Kakashi fought them both.

Like Kakashi. Someone who is stronger than Kakazu. And Faster. Which is why he got blitzed. Anyways have a good day stranger. I won't respond to whatever dribble you post next because it'll probably be more angry upset dribble that is laughably incorrect. \n\ntl:dr Kakazu sucks",

You probably live a very sheltered life and have never even been punched in the face let alone been in an actual fight so I\u2019ll give you a little bit of information when it comes to this stuff, being aware of your surroundings makes a huge difference in a fight. This is why there is a clear cut difference between a speed blitz and a sneak attack, on one hand you\u2019re aware of the fact that you\u2019re actually in a fight and have an opponent but your opponent is so fast you\u2019re incapable of reacting to them. On the other hand you\u2019re completely unaware of the fact that you even have an opponent in the first place and get snuck up on. Though I\u2019m probably wasting my time as you already have trouble distinguishing between these two things and will likely continue to be ignorant to the facts even after they\u2019re explained in simple enough terms for you to understand. \n\nI love how all you can do is throw out insults, then play victim and simply ignore facts.

Naruto was stronger than Sasuke when Sasuke left, which only further proves my point. He not only didn't bother to summon chief toad against him, he also was too petty to go for the win during their clash and sliced his forehead instead of aiming for his body to take the win. But again, even if Naruto had won, *nothing* would've stopped Sasuke from leaving. You can't make people stay if they don't want to. It's just not happening, regardless how much stronger someone is. Sasuke was weaker than Naruto and still left. It would take Sasuke to have a change in heart to stay, just like Oro.\n\nIt's you who doesn't understand how being OP works. You don't just label anybody you think is strong \"OP\". That's just not how that fucking works. You can't have a dozen people who are all relative to each other and say they're all OP. No. Again, going by your logic, many more characters are \"OP\" just for being strong, like Tsunade or Hiruzen, or even Kakashi. Not at all how that works. But, since it's all relative to you, Guy, Jiraiya, Kakashi, Tsunde, Oro, Itachi, Kisame, Hiruzen, Gaara, Naruto, Sasuke, etc are all OP for just being a lot stronger than those around them. Hell, even Zabuza who's killed how many people already? You know that saying, \"if everyone is special, then no one is special\"? Yeah, same shit applies here.\n\nItachi wouldn't just be \"running from Kakashi\", he'd be running from Kakashi, Guy, and Kurenai. There is no excuse for him running from Jiraiya unless he was weaker than him, especially not when it's a 2v1 with Kisame. He literally let Naruto go, the kid he came to the leaf for to begin with, just to run from Jiraiya.\n\nAll I could say is just agree to disagree. This ain't going anywhere and I'm not gonna keep repeating myself.",

Itachi was a double agent and did not want to actually capture Naruto. \n\nRunning against Jiraiya was a valid excuse Kisame would buy. \n\n\nYou do not know what OP means. It is relative.

He never fought Hidan and Kakuzu at the same time, when he fought Hidan It was Shikamaru, Choji and Ino trying their best to hold off Kakuzu but getting their assess handed to them. Then Kakuzu\u2019s hearts got involved with Kakashi\u2019s fight so he dealt with Hidan by tricking him with a shadow clone and moved on to Kakuzu, then while Kakashi was fighting Kakuzu, AND ONLY Kakuzu, Shikamaru dealt with Hidan and removed him from the fight by bringing him to the location where his trap was already set up. Kakashi continued to fight Kakuzu 1 on 1, got his ass handed to him and was about to have his heart literally ripped right out of his chest right before Shikamaru saved him by tricking Hidan into using Kakuzu\u2019s blood in his ritual. I know how the fight went buddy, but you calling Kakuzu fodder just shows how ignorant you actually are lmfao. \u201cA supposed high level nin getting snuck up on\u201d didn\u2019t I already explain to you that sneaking up on your opponent while their guard is down has been shown to be extremely effective against the most powerful of opponents through the entire series?

Damn son you salty af right now. Throwing out insults. Being caught off guard is the very essence of speed blitz. You need to provide me with a definition of sneak attacks being excluded.\n\n>No, I\u2019m not wrong. He never fought Hidan and Kakuzu at the same time,\n\nYes, yes you are. You can say he didn't all you want, but Kakashi fought them both. If you'd have watched the video you'd know this.\n\n>but you calling Kakuzu fodder just shows how ignorant you actually are lmfao.\n\nHe is fodder. He lost to a fatigued Naruto and his barely functioning Rasenshuriken.\n\n>didn\u2019t I already explain to you that sneaking up on your opponent while their guard is down has been shown to be extremely effective against the most powerful of opponents through the entire series? \n\nYeah, and it shouldn't happen to high-level ninjas unless I don't know, that Ninja is facing someone strong? Like Kakashi. Someone who is stronger than Kakazu. And Faster. Which is why he got blitzed. Anyways have a good day stranger. I won't respond to whatever dribble you post next because it'll probably be more angry upset dribble that is laughably incorrect. \n\ntl:dr Kakazu sucks",

You probably live a very sheltered life and have never even been punched in the face let alone been in an actual fight so I\u2019ll give you a little bit of information when it comes to this stuff, being aware of your surroundings makes a huge difference in a fight. This is why there is a clear cut difference between a speed blitz and a sneak attack, on one hand you\u2019re aware of the fact that you\u2019re actually in a fight and have an opponent but your opponent is so fast you\u2019re incapable of reacting to them. On the other hand you\u2019re completely unaware of the fact that you even have an opponent in the first place and get snuck up on. Though I\u2019m probably wasting my time as you already have trouble distinguishing between these two things and will likely continue to be ignorant to the facts even after they\u2019re explained in simple enough terms for you to understand. \n\nI love how all you can do is throw out insults, then play victim and simply ignore facts.

Naruto was stronger than Sasuke when Sasuke left, which only further proves my point. He not only didn't bother to summon chief toad against him, he also was too petty to go for the win during their clash and sliced his forehead instead of aiming for his body to take the win. But again, even if Naruto had won, *nothing* would've stopped Sasuke from leaving. You can't make people stay if they don't want to. It's just not happening, regardless how much stronger someone is. Sasuke was weaker than Naruto and still left. It would take Sasuke to have a change in heart to stay, just like Oro.\n\nIt's you who doesn't understand how being OP works. You don't just label anybody you think is strong \"OP\". That's just not how that fucking works. You can't have a dozen people who are all relative to each other and say they're all OP. No. Again, going by your logic, many more characters are \"OP\" just for being strong, like Tsunade or Hiruzen, or even Kakashi. Not at all how that works. But, since it's all relative to you, Guy, Jiraiya, Kakashi, Tsunde, Oro, Itachi, Kisame, Hiruzen, Gaara, Naruto, Sasuke, etc are all OP for just being a lot stronger than those around them. Hell, even Zabuza who's killed how many people already? You know that saying, \"if everyone is special, then no one is special\"? Yeah, same shit applies here.\n\nItachi wouldn't just be \"running from Kakashi\", he'd be running from Kakashi, Guy, and Kurenai. There is no excuse for him running from Jiraiya unless he was weaker than him, especially not when it's a 2v1 with Kisame. He literally let Naruto go, the kid he came to the leaf for to begin with, just to run from Jiraiya.\n\nAll I could say is just agree to disagree.

You probably live a very sheltered life and have never even been punched in the face let alone been in an actual fight so I\u2019ll give you a little bit of information when it comes to this stuff, being aware of your surroundings makes a huge difference in a fight. This is why there is a clear cut difference between a speed blitz and a sneak attack, on one hand you\u2019re aware of the fact that you\u2019re actually in a fight and have an opponent but your opponent is so fast you\u2019re incapable of reacting to them. On the other hand you\u2019re completely unaware of the fact that you even have an opponent in the first place and get snuck up on. Though I\u2019m probably wasting my time as you already have trouble distinguishing between these two things and will likely continue to be ignorant to the facts even after they\u2019re explained in simple enough terms for you to understand. \n\nI love how all you can do is throw out insults, then play victim and simply ignore facts.

Naruto was stronger than Sasuke when Sasuke left, which only further proves my point. He not only didn't bother to summon chief toad against him, he also was too petty to go for the win during their clash and sliced his forehead instead of aiming for his body to take the win. But again, even if Naruto had won, *nothing* would've stopped Sasuke from leaving. You can't make people stay if they don't want to. It's just not happening, regardless how much stronger someone is. Sasuke was weaker than Naruto and still left. It would take Sasuke to have a change in heart to stay, just like Oro.\n\nIt's you who doesn't understand how being OP works. You don't just label anybody you think is strong \"OP\". That's just not how that fucking works. You can't have a dozen people who are all relative to each other and say they're all OP. No. Again, going by your logic, many more characters are \"OP\" just for being strong, like Tsunade or Hiruzen, or even Kakashi. Not at all how that works. But, since it's all relative to you, Guy, Jiraiya, Kakashi, Tsunde, Oro, Itachi, Kisame, Hiruzen, Gaara, Naruto, Sasuke, etc are all OP for just being a lot stronger than those around them. Hell, even Zabuza who's killed how many people already? You know that saying, \"if everyone is special, then no one is special\"? Yeah, same shit applies here.\n\nItachi wouldn't just be \"running from Kakashi\", he'd be running from Kakashi, Guy, and Kurenai. There is no excuse for him running from Jiraiya unless he was weaker than him, especially not when it's a 2v1 with Kisame. He literally let Naruto go, the kid he came to the leaf for to begin with, just to run from Jiraiya.\n\nAll I could say is just agree to disagree.

Itachi was a double agent and did not want to actually capture Naruto. \n\nRunning against Jiraiya was a valid excuse Kisame would buy. \n\n\nYou do not know what OP means. It is relative.

You probably live a very sheltered life and have never even been punched in the face let alone been in an actual fight so I\u2019ll give you a little bit of information when it comes to this stuff, being aware of your surroundings makes a huge difference in a fight. This is why there is a clear cut difference between a speed blitz and a sneak attack, on one hand you\u2019re aware of the fact that you\u2019re actually in a fight and have an opponent but your opponent is so fast you\u2019re incapable of reacting to them. On the other hand you\u2019re completely unaware of the fact that you even have an opponent in the first place and get snuck up on. Though I\u2019m probably wasting my time as you already have trouble distinguishing between these two things and will likely continue to be ignorant to the facts even after they\u2019re explained in simple enough terms for you to understand. \n\nI love how all you can do is throw out insults, then play victim and simply ignore facts. But then again, ignorance is bliss. \n\nAlso\u2026 it\u2019s drivel, not dribble\ud83d\udc80",

            "body": "You're just not listening. Literally.\n\nThere is no evidence supporting Orochimaru being stronger than Jiraiya. Leaving is not that evidence. Naruto was stronger than Sasuke when Sasuke left, which only further proves my point. He not only didn't bother to summon chief toad against him, he also was too petty to go for the win during their clash and sliced his forehead instead of aiming for his body to take the win. But again, even if Naruto had won, *nothing* would've stopped Sasuke from leaving. You can't make people stay if they don't want to. It's just not happening, regardless how much stronger someone is. Sasuke was weaker than Naruto and still left. It would take Sasuke to have a change in heart to stay, just like Oro.\n\nIt's you who doesn't understand how being OP works. You don't just label anybody you think is strong \"OP\". That's just not how that fucking works. You can't have a dozen people who are all relative to each other and say they're all OP. No. Again, going by your logic, many more characters are \"OP\" just for being strong, like Tsunade or Hiruzen, or even Kakashi. Not at all how that works. But, since it's all relative to you, Guy, Jiraiya, Kakashi, Tsunde, Oro, Itachi, Kisame, Hiruzen, Gaara, Naruto, Sasuke, etc are all OP for just being a lot stronger than those around them. Hell, even Zabuza who's killed how many people already? You know that saying, \"if everyone is special, then no one is special\"? Yeah, same shit applies here.\n\nItachi wouldn't just be \"running from Kakashi\", he'd be running from Kakashi, Guy, and Kurenai. There is no excuse for him running from Jiraiya unless he was weaker than him, especially not when it's a 2v1 with Kisame. He literally let Naruto go, the kid he came to the leaf for to begin with, just to run from Jiraiya.\n\nAll I could say is just agree to disagree. This ain't going anywhere and I'm not gonna keep repeating myself.",
