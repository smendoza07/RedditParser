Most have returned home and have less flexibility to meet while home with Mom & Dad. \n - SBs with children will have child care issues that limit their availability. \n - Many SBs work retail, restaurant or hospitality jobs and are out of work and in greater need of financial support.\n - Many SDs have seen large impacts to their work, income and wealth impacting their ability to provide an allowance. \n - Many SDs may be working from home and have less availability if they are married or otherwise attached. \n - Many SDs are older, have health issues and may fall into high risk categories.   As a result they are less willing to meet. \n\nI'm a single man in my mid 50s, still in very good health, live alone and mostly insulated from the economic impact of the pandemic.   SBs seem to be very willing to go on lockdown together.  It's a great way to ride through a quarantine.",

It only took the largest and bloodiest war in all of human history to do that...\n\nI hope it wont take WWIII for us to turn a corner. \n\nBut again back to my first point Nazi Germany ignored their WWI debt bills and managed to do just fine, until you know Poland....",

Most have returned home and have less flexibility to meet while home with Mom & Dad. \n - SBs with children will have child care issues that limit their availability. \n - Many SBs work retail, restaurant or hospitality jobs and are out of work and in greater need of financial support.\n - Many SDs have seen large impacts to their work, income and wealth impacting their ability to provide an allowance. \n - Many SDs may be working from home and have less availability if they are married or otherwise attached. \n - Many SDs are older, have health issues and may fall into high risk categories.   As a result they are less willing to meet. \n\nI'm a single man in my mid 50s, still in very good health, live alone and mostly insulated from the economic impact of the pandemic.   SBs seem to be very willing to go on lockdown together.  It's a great way to ride through a quarantine.",

It only took the largest and bloodiest war in all of human history to do that...\n\nI hope it wont take WWIII for us to turn a corner. \n\nBut again back to my first point Nazi Germany ignored their WWI debt bills and managed to do just fine, until you know Poland....",
