            "body": "Hi guys!\n\nToday it has been growing for 1 year. At first it just needed a trim to get short enough. Then i started thinking about getting manbun(realized much later i would take ages AND i didnt like it that much. Also, I have no beard). Then i just started to enjoy the flow. People told me I was lucky and complimented my waves. Figured i should just keep going. Right now i can almost drag the hair on the side on my head to the bun, but i dont like ut as much as i thought, but it is very practical.\n\nI have tried to add some small descriptions of the styles i remember doing. My hair routine has been ~3 years of \n/r/nopoo, and I currently dont use products aside from some saltwater spray. \n\nEdit: After some digging, [this](http://i.imgur.com/gIdTmf3.jpg) is one of the pictures i brought to the cut. The hair on my top was not long enough at first, but my barber said it would get there in a couple of months.\n",
