I didnt think it would be too difficult, i essentially just wanted a high skin fade with a sort of textured french crop.Having done my research before hand i started to flip through my photos while giving a rundown of what i wanted with my hair, even using terms like \u201cpoint cut\u201d( which i explained just in case he didnt understand it). However, i ended up getting basically a crewcut with very little length on top. Now the haircut wasn\u2019t bad, it looks pretty good, but its definitely not what I wanted. Idk what the point of this post was I guess I was mostly ranting but yeah",
