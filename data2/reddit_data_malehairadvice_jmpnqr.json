And I won\u2019t blame them either for not knowing it.\n\nBut this is highly popularize by k-pop idols, and almost a common knowledge amongst Asian barber/hairstylist.\n\nThe thing with hair cut names/styles is they\u2019re not a one size fits all. A number 1 fade doesn\u2019t look the same on thick Asian hair and thin Caucasian hair. And usually, you want to show your barber how you want the end result to look, while you hold his/her hand as s/he is cutting your hair.\n\nIe, for the 2 block, it usually starts on the sides like an undercut. The only difference is you dint want your barber blending all the sides up to the crown of your head. So you tell him/her \u201chey, can we try a 1.5 clipper, and trim up 2 inches?\u201d, and see how you \u201cfeel\u201d. You have to feel it because you\u2019re wearing the haircut so you have to feel good about it. If it feels good, you ask them to properly blend it for you. Then you see how your hair sits. Too long? Ask them to cut short accordingly to your liking. Feels thick? Ask them to layer it. Such and such.",

And I won\u2019t blame them either for not knowing it.\n\nBut this is highly popularize by k-pop idols, and almost a common knowledge amongst Asian barber/hairstylist.\n\nThe thing with hair cut names/styles is they\u2019re not a one size fits all. A number 1 fade doesn\u2019t look the same on thick Asian hair and thin Caucasian hair. And usually, you want to show your barber how you want the end result to look, while you hold his/her hand as s/he is cutting your hair.\n\nIe, for the 2 block, it usually starts on the sides like an undercut. The only difference is you dint want your barber blending all the sides up to the crown of your head. So you tell him/her \u201chey, can we try a 1.5 clipper, and trim up 2 inches?\u201d, and see how you \u201cfeel\u201d. You have to feel it because you\u2019re wearing the haircut so you have to feel good about it. If it feels good, you ask them to properly blend it for you. Then you see how your hair sits. Too long? Ask them to cut short accordingly to your liking. Feels thick? Ask them to layer it. Such and such.",

And I won\u2019t blame them either for not knowing it.\n\nBut this is highly popularize by k-pop idols, and almost a common knowledge amongst Asian barber/hairstylist.\n\nThe thing with hair cut names/styles is they\u2019re not a one size fits all. A number 1 fade doesn\u2019t look the same on thick Asian hair and thin Caucasian hair. And usually, you want to show your barber how you want the end result to look, while you hold his/her hand as s/he is cutting your hair.\n\nIe, for the 2 block, it usually starts on the sides like an undercut. The only difference is you dint want your barber blending all the sides up to the crown of your head. So you tell him/her \u201chey, can we try a 1.5 clipper, and trim up 2 inches?\u201d, and see how you \u201cfeel\u201d. You have to feel it because you\u2019re wearing the haircut so you have to feel good about it. If it feels good, you ask them to properly blend it for you. Then you see how your hair sits. Too long? Ask them to cut short accordingly to your liking. Feels thick? Ask them to layer it. Such and such.",
