Its only been around 70 years since the Korean War and the country was decimated afterwards. Plenty of people, including my grandma, lived in poverty during this period. Its why if you eat with people there, you're always encouraged to eat more as that was the mentality back then; eat as much as you can because you might not know when or where the next meal will come. As S. Korea's economy developed and population grew, more people from the country moved to the city, but that poor country mentality still persisted. Recently this feeling is dwindling down as the last 20-30 years have seen the economic growth boom and less people are being raised in humble situations. I would say KJK's generation will be one of the last that has this kind of sentiment as most people born after him will have been raised in a developed S. Korea",

Such a dumb query.. His own stand about the environment is to try to save on things by using only what he needs.. It's not like the plane he uses to LA is private that it would not operate if he decides not to go.. it's a public transportation if you are not aware..\n\n>I don't care either way because I don't keep up with his shows but the conflicting actions and statements are kinda interesting.\n\nIt's just your poor comprehension and trying to be nosy with things that apparently, you do not have a full understanding about..",

Its only been around 70 years since the Korean War and the country was decimated afterwards. Plenty of people, including my grandma, lived in poverty during this period. Its why if you eat with people there, you're always encouraged to eat more as that was the mentality back then; eat as much as you can because you might not know when or where the next meal will come. As S. Korea's economy developed and population grew, more people from the country moved to the city, but that poor country mentality still persisted. Recently this feeling is dwindling down as the last 20-30 years have seen the economic growth boom and less people are being raised in humble situations. I would say KJK's generation will be one of the last that has this kind of sentiment as most people born after him will have been raised in a developed S. Korea",

Its only been around 70 years since the Korean War and the country was decimated afterwards. Plenty of people, including my grandma, lived in poverty during this period. Its why if you eat with people there, you're always encouraged to eat more as that was the mentality back then; eat as much as you can because you might not know when or where the next meal will come. As S. Korea's economy developed and population grew, more people from the country moved to the city, but that poor country mentality still persisted. Recently this feeling is dwindling down as the last 20-30 years have seen the economic growth boom and less people are being raised in humble situations. I would say KJK's generation will be one of the last that has this kind of sentiment as most people born after him will have been raised in a developed S. Korea",

No. in his show with his own friends titled Dragon Club, you can actually watch him using water on the maximum pressure and use tissues decently (if thats how you call it).. bottomline, he only acts his capitalized characters on certain shows..",
