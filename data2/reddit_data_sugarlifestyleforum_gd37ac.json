    "body": "Do you remember how unbearably hot it was when we finally met in person? The temperature must\u2019ve reached 100 degrees before it hit noon. I was full of nerves that day, I remember you reaching across the table to caress my face and spilling your drink. I quickly found out you were clumsy. \n\nDo you remember handing me that Chanel perfume? You said everyone who used that fragrance would remember it and that was the idea. \n\nDo you remember waking up one morning still deep inside me? I was very sore but full of bliss. Your salt and pepper head resting on my chest. You listened to my heartbeat and told me how you have the perfect life, perfect family but felt so lonely? Do you remember making love to me three times that day? You sure came hard. \n\nDo you remember us running off to all the small secluded beaches we could find in Florida? The spontaneous naughty hike trails? Do you remember how you said you\u2019ve never felt so comfortable around someone? How you were addicted to me? \u201cIt is so easy being with you.\u201d I made you laugh. That stupid, corporate laugh. Do you remember occasionally looking down at me and smiling? \n\nWe shared a drink outside our favorite Cuban restaurant and on our way back to the hotel, you asked me if i wanted a real relationship one day? I jokingly said, this is real! I remember how gentle your mouth felt against my sticky forehead. \n\nDon\u2019t you remember? That was the last night we spent together. The next morning, you woke up in a panic because you\u2019d slept through your alarm after our marathon of rolling in the sheets. You were running late for work and kissed me goodbye on your way out. Then you stared at me deeply and said you\u2019d come visit soon. It was disarming. I believed it.",

Some people in arrangements can just let go and perhaps feels less guilt because they have the other life they live (married I'm assuming). \n\nI may be going against the grain here, but I think you should just ask him straight up and tell him he owes you some kind of explanation and closure because you invested your time into this just as much as he did.
