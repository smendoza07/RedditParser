You could easily get away with being both a samurai and a spy. As for someone like Hanz\u014d, he would act as a spymaster or an intelligence officer, organizing and leading these missions.\n\n>And samurai considered it dishonorable to use stealth but Sun Tzu would be proud.\n\nDepends on your definition of honor. Samurai were individuals and their ideas of honor varied not only from one person to another, but also depending on the location, time period and ideals of their particular lord. The one thing that stays more or less consistent throughout, however, is loyalty. Broadly speaking, loyalty to one's family and one's lord was everything to a samurai: a good samurai was expected to obey their orders to the letter, no questions asked. Your lord commands you to go to war? You do it. Kill an innocent child? You do it. Spy on the enemy? You do it. Pretty much everything is fair game and honorable if it's in service to your lord, because a samurai's honor is defined by their ability to serve. That's literally what the word means: \"One Who Serves.\" Of course there are always exceptions (see Honn\u014dji Temple) but if any kind of a universal norm in terms of how the samurai defined the concept of honor ever existed, it would have been this one.\n\n> Ya one could be both but why wouldn't they have shunned him?\n\nSee previous answer. A samurai who successfully completes a stealth mission ordered by his lord would be celebrated by his peers, family and said lord alike.",

Like the fuck? If you're going to push this narrative, at least fight a genius who around the level of experience as you to makes things fair. \n\nOh, wait, Neji. \n\nLee couldn't beat Neji so he targeted Sasuke. \n\nAnd even tried using the primary lotus, a forbidden technique on a leaf comrade in what appears to be a sparring match. \n\nPretty dickish of Lee.",

Naruto's ninjas are based on legends of Shinobi, and thus are capable of using magic, just like them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Superhuman or supernatural powers were often associated with the ninja. Some legends include flight, invisibility, shapeshifting, teleportation, the ability to \"split\" into multiple bodies (bunshin), the summoning of animals (kuchiyose), and control over the five classical elements. These fabulous notions have stemmed from popular imagination regarding the ninja's mysterious status, as well as romantic ideas found in later Japanese art of the Edo period. Magical powers were rooted in the ninja's own misinformation efforts to disseminate fanciful information. For example, Nakagawa Shoshunjin, the 17th-century founder of Nakagawa-ry\u016b, claimed in his own writings (Okufuji Monogatari) that he had the ability to transform into birds and animals.\\[78\\]  \n>  \n>Perceived control over the elements may be grounded in real tactics, which were categorized by association with forces of nature. For example, the practice of starting fires in order to cover a ninja's trail falls under katon-no-jutsu (\"fire techniques\").\\[107\\] By dressing in identicle clothing, a coordinated team of ninjas could instill the perception of a single assailant being in multiple locations.\n\n[Ninja - Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja#:~:text=A%20ninja%20(%E5%BF%8D%E8%80%85%2C%20Japanese%20pronunciation,in%20martial%20arts%2C%20including%20ninjutsu.))",

You could easily get away with being both a samurai and a spy. As for someone like Hanz\u014d, he would act as a spymaster or an intelligence officer, organizing and leading these missions.\n\n>And samurai considered it dishonorable to use stealth but Sun Tzu would be proud.\n\nDepends on your definition of honor. Samurai were individuals and their ideas of honor varied not only from one person to another, but also depending on the location, time period and ideals of their particular lord. The one thing that stays more or less consistent throughout, however, is loyalty. Broadly speaking, loyalty to one's family and one's lord was everything to a samurai: a good samurai was expected to obey their orders to the letter, no questions asked. Your lord commands you to go to war? You do it. Kill an innocent child? You do it. Spy on the enemy? You do it. Pretty much everything is fair game and honorable if it's in service to your lord, because a samurai's honor is defined by their ability to serve. That's literally what the word means: \"One Who Serves.\" Of course there are always exceptions (see Honn\u014dji Temple) but if any kind of a universal norm in terms of how the samurai defined the concept of honor ever existed, it would have been this one.\n\n> Ya one could be both but why wouldn't they have shunned him?\n\nSee previous answer. A samurai who successfully completes a stealth mission ordered by his lord would be celebrated by his peers, family and said lord alike.",

Amongst the samurai, a sense of ritual and\u00a0decorum\u00a0was observed, where one was expected to fight or\u00a0duel\u00a0openly.

You could easily get away with being both a samurai and a spy. As for someone like Hanz\u014d, he would act as a spymaster or an intelligence officer, organizing and leading these missions.\n\n>And samurai considered it dishonorable to use stealth but Sun Tzu would be proud.\n\nDepends on your definition of honor. Samurai were individuals and their ideas of honor varied not only from one person to another, but also depending on the location, time period and ideals of their particular lord. The one thing that stays more or less consistent throughout, however, is loyalty. Broadly speaking, loyalty to one's family and one's lord was everything to a samurai: a good samurai was expected to obey their orders to the letter, no questions asked. Your lord commands you to go to war? You do it. Kill an innocent child? You do it. Spy on the enemy? You do it. Pretty much everything is fair game and honorable if it's in service to your lord, because a samurai's honor is defined by their ability to serve. That's literally what the word means: \"One Who Serves.\" Of course there are always exceptions (see Honn\u014dji Temple) but if any kind of a universal norm in terms of how the samurai defined the concept of honor ever existed, it would have been this one.\n\n> Ya one could be both but why wouldn't they have shunned him?\n\nSee previous answer. A samurai who successfully completes a stealth mission ordered by his lord would be celebrated by his peers, family and said lord alike.",

Amongst the samurai, a sense of ritual and\u00a0decorum\u00a0was observed, where one was expected to fight or\u00a0duel\u00a0openly.

Perhaps they also have shinobi who spied on the people you protect and saw you there.",

You could easily get away with being both a samurai and a spy. As for someone like Hanz\u014d, he would act as a spymaster or an intelligence officer, organizing and leading these missions.\n\n>And samurai considered it dishonorable to use stealth but Sun Tzu would be proud.\n\nDepends on your definition of honor. Samurai were individuals and their ideas of honor varied not only from one person to another, but also depending on the location, time period and ideals of their particular lord. The one thing that stays more or less consistent throughout, however, is loyalty. Broadly speaking, loyalty to one's family and one's lord was everything to a samurai: a good samurai was expected to obey their orders to the letter, no questions asked. Your lord commands you to go to war? You do it. Kill an innocent child? You do it. Spy on the enemy? You do it. Pretty much everything is fair game and honorable if it's in service to your lord, because a samurai's honor is defined by their ability to serve. That's literally what the word means: \"One Who Serves.\" Of course there are always exceptions (see Honn\u014dji Temple) but if any kind of a universal norm in terms of how the samurai defined the concept of honor ever existed, it would have been this one.\n\n> Ya one could be both but why wouldn't they have shunned him?\n\nSee previous answer. A samurai who successfully completes a stealth mission ordered by his lord would be celebrated by his peers, family and said lord alike.",

Amongst the samurai, a sense of ritual and\u00a0decorum\u00a0was observed, where one was expected to fight or\u00a0duel\u00a0openly. Combined with the unrest of the\u00a0Sengoku period, these factors created a demand for men willing to commit deeds considered disreputable for conventional warriors.\n\nYa the feudal lords would be fine with it since they were ordered them to do it but the other samurai weren't.\n\nWhen Japan entered a period of peace, Edo I think, shinobi were shunned and kunoichi often became prostitutes.\n\nI said being well known was bad for a spy was because when a bunch of people know your face it's possible someone in enemy territory will recognize you. Perhaps they also have shinobi who spied on the people you protect and saw you there.",
