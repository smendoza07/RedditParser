From this I've learned most people are into the beard, which was kind of how I felt, and that I\u2019m Clark Kent, which is surprising because usually people learn about alter egos the other way round. Consensus is also I look much younger without, and a friend pointed out you're only young once, so in all I'll keep the beard for the most part but will alternate every couple months.",

Particularly with the mustache stubbly and maybe the soul patch area completely clean shaven. Also, avoid a dark mass directly under the chin.\n\nFor the hair: The sides are a bit too bulky for your face, especially where the sides near the top - have that area cut short enough so nothing protrudes past the tip of your ear, all the way up. (I\u2019m saying your ear should be the point furthest away from your face, not your hair. No need to cut super short to achieve that.)\n\nAlso for the hair: You might enjoy moving the part line slightly closer to the center. This wouldn\u2019t have worked previously due to the bulk on the upper sides, but once that\u2019s fixed you will be able to part up to 1 inch closer to center. Finally, try a matte pomade applied to nearly dry hair to bring out the layering of a quality haircut.",

They just feel heavy to me, in the way that not many people's features lend to look good with thick, full eyebrows. They just look jarring, even though it's in fashion right now.
