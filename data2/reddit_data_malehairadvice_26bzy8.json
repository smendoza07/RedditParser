Carbs never make you as satiated as protein, so make sure you can eat as much as possible. Thomas Keller's roasted chicken is one of my favorite recipes for being tasty, foolproof, and decently inexpensive:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxm1vPwUQDY\n\nCutting up all of the veggies takes some time, but hey, that's what tv/netflix is for! (Cutting out the wishbone isn't a requirement. Also, you don't need to roast the veggies separately. I rub butter on the outside to create a tastier and crispier skin, too.) Be sure to throw parsnips in the vegetable mix for some great flavor.",

Thomas Keller's roasted chicken is one of my favorite recipes for being tasty, foolproof, and decently inexpensive:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxm1vPwUQDY\n\nCutting up all of the veggies takes some time, but hey, that's what tv/netflix is for! (Cutting out the wishbone isn't a requirement. Also, you don't need to roast the veggies separately. I rub butter on the outside to create a tastier and crispier skin, too.) Be sure to throw parsnips in the vegetable mix for some great flavor.",

Thomas Keller's roasted chicken is one of my favorite recipes for being tasty, foolproof, and decently inexpensive:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxm1vPwUQDY\n\nCutting up all of the veggies takes some time, but hey, that's what tv/netflix is for! (Cutting out the wishbone isn't a requirement. Also, you don't need to roast the veggies separately. I rub butter on the outside to create a tastier and crispier skin, too.) Be sure to throw parsnips in the vegetable mix for some great flavor.",
