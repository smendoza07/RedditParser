    "body": "Has anyone else had times where they had to contemplate their actions and existence after a date?\n\nI recently had a first date with a new SD. After we were intimate, we were just hanging out and talking, and he brought the topic to politics. I usually try and steer clear because I'm sure that most men I encounter will essentially have opposite political views to me, but for some reason I felt compelled to try and debate him this time. Then he says, \"so does that means you're on Ukraine's side in the war, too?\" and goes on to argue in favour of Putin and Russia.\n\nAnyway, I sat in a McDonald's for an hour eating fries  and thinking about my life after that. I don't think I'll see him again lol",

Have you been asleep the last year?\n\nAs far as, hormones for teens, the only real objection that Conservatives have is giving them to people who are minors and in early stage of growth. If young people are deemed incapable of \u2018legally\u2019 making most complex decisions (sex, alcohol, liabilities, etc.) for themselves due to age and maturity then something like that is no different and can have life long consequences. Giving them at too young of an age can have irreversible affect. If we were talking about a tattoo that could be removed that is one thing.\n\nLook at Jazz Jennings! They gave her hormones at a young age and she was restricted from having the preferred surgical method to transition due to lack of full male organ growth. It caused them to use the least preferred which caused other complications and hygiene issues. Not to mention, she put on a massive amount of weight which can cause serious health problems. No one else in their family has that issue, and yet, the one taking hormones did, you can\u2019t tell me the hormones weren\u2019t a factor. These are some of the more tame problems that can result from it. \n\nThey, also, don\u2019t believe parents should make it for them as it it a very personal choice and shouldn\u2019t be in the hands of others. Once a person reaches age of majority then people are free to do as they please.\n\nYoung people are given to impulsivity and rash decisions, at least, if, they make a decision at a more informed and mature age then it is one they have to accept as their own.\n\nRegardless, refusing hormone treatment that\u2019s an elective decision and not the result of a life threatening disease is hardly harmful.",

I am not going to get into a long drawn out autobiography, but, simply, being white, male, and hetero who is perfectly comfortable with his biological sex does not equate to privilege despite what some will argue.\n\nRepublicans do not \u201cactively create suffering for marginalized individuals,\u201d that is a fallacy and one of the points I was addressing when I talked about misinformation. Spin doctors will make anything sound tragic and create outrage bc THEY are the ones profiting from it and we all lose in the end. \n\nSome of the things that certain people over sensationalize as \u2018suffering\u2019 are hardly that and diminish those who are truly suffering. Limitations on entitlements and issues that, in themselves, are privileges are being conflated with rights and/or suffering. This is a broad statement and not, necessarily, aimed at the Trans community.\n\nI am not saying that kind of person does not exist\u2026there are a lot of types of people that I couldn\u2019t imagine being\u2026a serial killer for example \u2026but we all know they exist. It\u2019s not cognitive dissonance unless I am conflicted or feel anxiety from it. Which I don\u2019t!\n\nI don\u2019t doubt your experiences, appreciate them and your willingness to share.\n\nI would, also, say that, at least, some of your experiences are less about you being Trans and more about the dynamic when it comes to SR. Biological women find themselves on the receiving end of those in similar fashion. Having said that, I don\u2019t doubt that there are many that are specific to being Trans.\n\nAs in any social or romantic situation there are predators and no matter what we do there will always be. The only thing we can hope for is they get caught and are held accountable. Every law we have on the matter fully protects any individual no matter what category or position they find themselves in. It\u2019s just the application of those laws that can, at times, be lopsided. I\u2019d contend that the gap in application is diminishing more and more every day, which, I am glad to see.\n\nMy mother, my brother (who I chat with near daily), and my cousin (who is like a brother) are all gay and my nephew is Trans. We don\u2019t, normally, have these conversations which is why I appreciate this one.\n\nI referred in one of my other comments to my parents who have different political ideologies, have been married for 50 years and are happy but I want to clarify that it is my step mother. I know this point has nothing to do with our conversation but I assume someone may read our exchange and try to play \u2018gotcha\u2019 with me so I want to address it now.\n\nI\u2019d say it is best that we both retreat from this conversation bc, although, I do not intend on this getting heated or offensive for either of us, I recognize that it may.\n\nBest of luck!\u270c\ufe0f",

The issue is that pro-lifers consider the growth in the woman's womb to be an individual human life rather than a growth with a potential to be a human life. If you look at it from their perspective, albeit wrong, their argument is logically consistent. \n\nThe vast majority of Americans support some abortion restrictions, which most also supporting legalized abortion. For instance, I do not support partial birth abortion, though I am pro choice and support free on demand abortions provided by the state for at least the first 2 trimesters. \n\nIt's hard to define specifically when the growth in the woman's body is an \"independent life\" and that's the crux of the issue. The pro-life side sees the growth as being an \"independent life\" at the moment of conception and therefore think abortion is murdering a baby. The issue is far more complex and nuanced than the \"my body, my choice\" bullshit mantra wants it to be.",

Keep in mind that selling an organ or suicide were never a right to begin with (though assisted suicide is legal in some States, if I recall correctly). In this instance, womens' rights are very much being infringed on. It will also not end here. They are already trying to criminalize miscarriages, birth control, and they're doubling down on refusing women sterilization. And that's only a tiny part of what reversing R&W is affecting.

Plus the conversations are more engaging, instead of, two people just parroting each other.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid of a challenge to your sensibility or different perspectives. Don\u2019t be close minded!\n\nThere may be some considerations needed for a VR or marriage but an SR shouldn\u2019t be limited to just an exchange of bodily fluids or money.\n\nJust like in any other social environment, politics and religion should be avoided unless trust and respect have been established.\n\nI have many VERY CLOSE friends and family members who have completely opposite views than myself and that hasn\u2019t stopped us from loving each other.\n\nMy parents, for instance, have polar opposite views but they have been happy and loving throughout their, nearly, 50 years of marriage.\n\nIMO / IME, it\u2019s usually the younger and/or less mature persons that waste that much effort and prejudice on issues like that, but is not always the case. Firmly grounded individuals have more going on in life than to be so preoccupied.\n\nTake me, for example! I am an Atheist, Conservative, Republican (more center Right), who believes in Reproductive Rights, albeit, with some restrictions. Maybe I am a unicorn, in that regard!

Have you been asleep the last year?\n\nAs far as, hormones for teens, the only real objection that Conservatives have is giving them to people who are minors and in early stage of growth. If young people are deemed incapable of \u2018legally\u2019 making most complex decisions (sex, alcohol, liabilities, etc.) for themselves due to age and maturity then something like that is no different and can have life long consequences. Giving them at too young of an age can have irreversible affect. If we were talking about a tattoo that could be removed that is one thing.\n\nLook at Jazz Jennings! They gave her hormones at a young age and she was restricted from having the preferred surgical method to transition due to lack of full male organ growth. It caused them to use the least preferred which caused other complications and hygiene issues. Not to mention, she put on a massive amount of weight which can cause serious health problems. No one else in their family has that issue, and yet, the one taking hormones did, you can\u2019t tell me the hormones weren\u2019t a factor. These are some of the more tame problems that can result from it. \n\nThey, also, don\u2019t believe parents should make it for them as it it a very personal choice and shouldn\u2019t be in the hands of others. Once a person reaches age of majority then people are free to do as they please.\n\nYoung people are given to impulsivity and rash decisions, at least, if, they make a decision at a more informed and mature age then it is one they have to accept as their own.\n\nRegardless, refusing hormone treatment that\u2019s an elective decision and not the result of a life threatening disease is hardly harmful.",

They believe what they read and see without really breaking down the information and fact checking. Some seem to be incapable of forming their own opinion. It is easier to call someone a fascist then to really have a fact based discussion.  If they did, they would find out that they, along with most people, want the same basic things in life. We all have much more in common than we know or care to know. We may have some disagreements on the best way to accomplish certain societal goals, but they should be civil disagreements. We should rationally discuss ways to make the world better for everyone.",

I am not going to get into a long drawn out autobiography, but, simply, being white, male, and hetero who is perfectly comfortable with his biological sex does not equate to privilege despite what some will argue.\n\nRepublicans do not \u201cactively create suffering for marginalized individuals,\u201d that is a fallacy and one of the points I was addressing when I talked about misinformation. Spin doctors will make anything sound tragic and create outrage bc THEY are the ones profiting from it and we all lose in the end. \n\nSome of the things that certain people over sensationalize as \u2018suffering\u2019 are hardly that and diminish those who are truly suffering. Limitations on entitlements and issues that, in themselves, are privileges are being conflated with rights and/or suffering. This is a broad statement and not, necessarily, aimed at the Trans community.\n\nI am not saying that kind of person does not exist\u2026there are a lot of types of people that I couldn\u2019t imagine being\u2026a serial killer for example \u2026but we all know they exist. It\u2019s not cognitive dissonance unless I am conflicted or feel anxiety from it. Which I don\u2019t!\n\nI don\u2019t doubt your experiences, appreciate them and your willingness to share.\n\nI would, also, say that, at least, some of your experiences are less about you being Trans and more about the dynamic when it comes to SR. Biological women find themselves on the receiving end of those in similar fashion. Having said that, I don\u2019t doubt that there are many that are specific to being Trans.\n\nAs in any social or romantic situation there are predators and no matter what we do there will always be. The only thing we can hope for is they get caught and are held accountable. Every law we have on the matter fully protects any individual no matter what category or position they find themselves in. It\u2019s just the application of those laws that can, at times, be lopsided. I\u2019d contend that the gap in application is diminishing more and more every day, which, I am glad to see.\n\nMy mother, my brother (who I chat with near daily), and my cousin (who is like a brother) are all gay and my nephew is Trans. We don\u2019t, normally, have these conversations which is why I appreciate this one.\n\nI referred in one of my other comments to my parents who have different political ideologies, have been married for 50 years and are happy but I want to clarify that it is my step mother. I know this point has nothing to do with our conversation but I assume someone may read our exchange and try to play \u2018gotcha\u2019 with me so I want to address it now.\n\nI\u2019d say it is best that we both retreat from this conversation bc, although, I do not intend on this getting heated or offensive for either of us, I recognize that it may.\n\nBest of luck!\u270c\ufe0f",

Trying to compare Conservatives and/or Republicans to Nazis is not only ludicrous and illogical but is obscene.\n\nAre there extremists and bad players? Yes, but they exist on both sides and are not more concentrated on either more than the other.\n\nIf your response is going to be to refute that point then don\u2019t bother bc we aren\u2019t going to come together on this nor are you going to best me with irrational blather.\n\nThis a perfect reason why you don\u2019t get into political discussions in this type of dynamic.

The both sides thing is such bullshit. Extremist republicans want to ban same sex marriage, lynch black people, and overthrow the government. Extremist democrats try to ban soda and gas powered cars. At worst they're communist do-gooder's who can't figure out why communism is a terrible idea. One side: literally fascists trying to install a dictator. Other side: misguided and naive.",

You won't convince a pro-lifer by using a vacuous argument. The issue is that pro-lifers consider the growth in the woman's womb to be an individual human life rather than a growth with a potential to be a human life. If you look at it from their perspective, albeit wrong, their argument is logically consistent. \n\nThe vast majority of Americans support some abortion restrictions, which most also supporting legalized abortion. For instance, I do not support partial birth abortion, though I am pro choice and support free on demand abortions provided by the state for at least the first 2 trimesters. \n\nIt's hard to define specifically when the growth in the woman's body is an \"independent life\" and that's the crux of the issue. The pro-life side sees the growth as being an \"independent life\" at the moment of conception and therefore think abortion is murdering a baby. The issue is far more complex and nuanced than the \"my body, my choice\" bullshit mantra wants it to be.",

Have you been asleep the last year?\n\nAs far as, hormones for teens, the only real objection that Conservatives have is giving them to people who are minors and in early stage of growth. If young people are deemed incapable of \u2018legally\u2019 making most complex decisions (sex, alcohol, liabilities, etc.) for themselves due to age and maturity then something like that is no different and can have life long consequences. Giving them at too young of an age can have irreversible affect. If we were talking about a tattoo that could be removed that is one thing.\n\nLook at Jazz Jennings! They gave her hormones at a young age and she was restricted from having the preferred surgical method to transition due to lack of full male organ growth. It caused them to use the least preferred which caused other complications and hygiene issues. Not to mention, she put on a massive amount of weight which can cause serious health problems. No one else in their family has that issue, and yet, the one taking hormones did, you can\u2019t tell me the hormones weren\u2019t a factor. These are some of the more tame problems that can result from it. \n\nThey, also, don\u2019t believe parents should make it for them as it it a very personal choice and shouldn\u2019t be in the hands of others. Once a person reaches age of majority then people are free to do as they please.\n\nYoung people are given to impulsivity and rash decisions, at least, if, they make a decision at a more informed and mature age then it is one they have to accept as their own.\n\nRegardless, refusing hormone treatment that\u2019s an elective decision and not the result of a life threatening disease is hardly harmful.",

I am not going to get into a long drawn out autobiography, but, simply, being white, male, and hetero who is perfectly comfortable with his biological sex does not equate to privilege despite what some will argue.\n\nRepublicans do not \u201cactively create suffering for marginalized individuals,\u201d that is a fallacy and one of the points I was addressing when I talked about misinformation. Spin doctors will make anything sound tragic and create outrage bc THEY are the ones profiting from it and we all lose in the end. \n\nSome of the things that certain people over sensationalize as \u2018suffering\u2019 are hardly that and diminish those who are truly suffering. Limitations on entitlements and issues that, in themselves, are privileges are being conflated with rights and/or suffering. This is a broad statement and not, necessarily, aimed at the Trans community.\n\nI am not saying that kind of person does not exist\u2026there are a lot of types of people that I couldn\u2019t imagine being\u2026a serial killer for example \u2026but we all know they exist. It\u2019s not cognitive dissonance unless I am conflicted or feel anxiety from it. Which I don\u2019t!\n\nI don\u2019t doubt your experiences, appreciate them and your willingness to share.\n\nI would, also, say that, at least, some of your experiences are less about you being Trans and more about the dynamic when it comes to SR. Biological women find themselves on the receiving end of those in similar fashion. Having said that, I don\u2019t doubt that there are many that are specific to being Trans.\n\nAs in any social or romantic situation there are predators and no matter what we do there will always be. The only thing we can hope for is they get caught and are held accountable. Every law we have on the matter fully protects any individual no matter what category or position they find themselves in. It\u2019s just the application of those laws that can, at times, be lopsided. I\u2019d contend that the gap in application is diminishing more and more every day, which, I am glad to see.\n\nMy mother, my brother (who I chat with near daily), and my cousin (who is like a brother) are all gay and my nephew is Trans. We don\u2019t, normally, have these conversations which is why I appreciate this one.\n\nI referred in one of my other comments to my parents who have different political ideologies, have been married for 50 years and are happy but I want to clarify that it is my step mother. I know this point has nothing to do with our conversation but I assume someone may read our exchange and try to play \u2018gotcha\u2019 with me so I want to address it now.\n\nI\u2019d say it is best that we both retreat from this conversation bc, although, I do not intend on this getting heated or offensive for either of us, I recognize that it may.\n\nBest of luck!\u270c\ufe0f",

Have you been asleep the last year?\n\nAs far as, hormones for teens, the only real objection that Conservatives have is giving them to people who are minors and in early stage of growth. If young people are deemed incapable of \u2018legally\u2019 making most complex decisions (sex, alcohol, liabilities, etc.) for themselves due to age and maturity then something like that is no different and can have life long consequences. Giving them at too young of an age can have irreversible affect. If we were talking about a tattoo that could be removed that is one thing.\n\nLook at Jazz Jennings! They gave her hormones at a young age and she was restricted from having the preferred surgical method to transition due to lack of full male organ growth. It caused them to use the least preferred which caused other complications and hygiene issues. Not to mention, she put on a massive amount of weight which can cause serious health problems. No one else in their family has that issue, and yet, the one taking hormones did, you can\u2019t tell me the hormones weren\u2019t a factor. These are some of the more tame problems that can result from it. \n\nThey, also, don\u2019t believe parents should make it for them as it it a very personal choice and shouldn\u2019t be in the hands of others. Once a person reaches age of majority then people are free to do as they please.\n\nYoung people are given to impulsivity and rash decisions, at least, if, they make a decision at a more informed and mature age then it is one they have to accept as their own.\n\nRegardless, refusing hormone treatment that\u2019s an elective decision and not the result of a life threatening disease is hardly harmful.",

I am not going to get into a long drawn out autobiography, but, simply, being white, male, and hetero who is perfectly comfortable with his biological sex does not equate to privilege despite what some will argue.\n\nRepublicans do not \u201cactively create suffering for marginalized individuals,\u201d that is a fallacy and one of the points I was addressing when I talked about misinformation. Spin doctors will make anything sound tragic and create outrage bc THEY are the ones profiting from it and we all lose in the end. \n\nSome of the things that certain people over sensationalize as \u2018suffering\u2019 are hardly that and diminish those who are truly suffering. Limitations on entitlements and issues that, in themselves, are privileges are being conflated with rights and/or suffering. This is a broad statement and not, necessarily, aimed at the Trans community.\n\nI am not saying that kind of person does not exist\u2026there are a lot of types of people that I couldn\u2019t imagine being\u2026a serial killer for example \u2026but we all know they exist. It\u2019s not cognitive dissonance unless I am conflicted or feel anxiety from it. Which I don\u2019t!\n\nI don\u2019t doubt your experiences, appreciate them and your willingness to share.\n\nI would, also, say that, at least, some of your experiences are less about you being Trans and more about the dynamic when it comes to SR. Biological women find themselves on the receiving end of those in similar fashion. Having said that, I don\u2019t doubt that there are many that are specific to being Trans.\n\nAs in any social or romantic situation there are predators and no matter what we do there will always be. The only thing we can hope for is they get caught and are held accountable. Every law we have on the matter fully protects any individual no matter what category or position they find themselves in. It\u2019s just the application of those laws that can, at times, be lopsided. I\u2019d contend that the gap in application is diminishing more and more every day, which, I am glad to see.\n\nMy mother, my brother (who I chat with near daily), and my cousin (who is like a brother) are all gay and my nephew is Trans. We don\u2019t, normally, have these conversations which is why I appreciate this one.\n\nI referred in one of my other comments to my parents who have different political ideologies, have been married for 50 years and are happy but I want to clarify that it is my step mother. I know this point has nothing to do with our conversation but I assume someone may read our exchange and try to play \u2018gotcha\u2019 with me so I want to address it now.\n\nI\u2019d say it is best that we both retreat from this conversation bc, although, I do not intend on this getting heated or offensive for either of us, I recognize that it may.\n\nBest of luck!\u270c\ufe0f",

You won't convince a pro-lifer by using a vacuous argument. The issue is that pro-lifers consider the growth in the woman's womb to be an individual human life rather than a growth with a potential to be a human life. If you look at it from their perspective, albeit wrong, their argument is logically consistent. \n\nThe vast majority of Americans support some abortion restrictions, which most also supporting legalized abortion. For instance, I do not support partial birth abortion, though I am pro choice and support free on demand abortions provided by the state for at least the first 2 trimesters. \n\nIt's hard to define specifically when the growth in the woman's body is an \"independent life\" and that's the crux of the issue. The pro-life side sees the growth as being an \"independent life\" at the moment of conception and therefore think abortion is murdering a baby. The issue is far more complex and nuanced than the \"my body, my choice\" bullshit mantra wants it to be.",

Keep in mind that selling an organ or suicide were never a right to begin with (though assisted suicide is legal in some States, if I recall correctly). In this instance, womens' rights are very much being infringed on. It will also not end here. They are already trying to criminalize miscarriages, birth control, and they're doubling down on refusing women sterilization. And that's only a tiny part of what reversing R&W is affecting.

Have you been asleep the last year?\n\nAs far as, hormones for teens, the only real objection that Conservatives have is giving them to people who are minors and in early stage of growth. If young people are deemed incapable of \u2018legally\u2019 making most complex decisions (sex, alcohol, liabilities, etc.) for themselves due to age and maturity then something like that is no different and can have life long consequences. Giving them at too young of an age can have irreversible affect. If we were talking about a tattoo that could be removed that is one thing.\n\nLook at Jazz Jennings! They gave her hormones at a young age and she was restricted from having the preferred surgical method to transition due to lack of full male organ growth. It caused them to use the least preferred which caused other complications and hygiene issues. Not to mention, she put on a massive amount of weight which can cause serious health problems. No one else in their family has that issue, and yet, the one taking hormones did, you can\u2019t tell me the hormones weren\u2019t a factor. These are some of the more tame problems that can result from it. \n\nThey, also, don\u2019t believe parents should make it for them as it it a very personal choice and shouldn\u2019t be in the hands of others. Once a person reaches age of majority then people are free to do as they please.\n\nYoung people are given to impulsivity and rash decisions, at least, if, they make a decision at a more informed and mature age then it is one they have to accept as their own.\n\nRegardless, refusing hormone treatment that\u2019s an elective decision and not the result of a life threatening disease is hardly harmful.",

Spin doctors will make anything sound tragic and create outrage bc THEY are the ones profiting from it and we all lose in the end. \n\nSome of the things that certain people over sensationalize as \u2018suffering\u2019 are hardly that and diminish those who are truly suffering.

Which I don\u2019t!\n\nI don\u2019t doubt your experiences, appreciate them and your willingness to share.\n\nI would, also, say that, at least, some of your experiences are less about you being Trans and more about the dynamic when it comes to SR. Biological women find themselves on the receiving end of those in similar fashion. Having said that, I don\u2019t doubt that there are many that are specific to being Trans.\n\nAs in any social or romantic situation there are predators and no matter what we do there will always be. The only thing we can hope for is they get caught and are held accountable. Every law we have on the matter fully protects any individual no matter what category or position they find themselves in. It\u2019s just the application of those laws that can, at times, be lopsided. I\u2019d contend that the gap in application is diminishing more and more every day, which, I am glad to see.\n\nMy mother, my brother (who I chat with near daily), and my cousin (who is like a brother) are all gay and my nephew is Trans. We don\u2019t, normally, have these conversations which is why I appreciate this one.\n\nI referred in one of my other comments to my parents who have different political ideologies, have been married for 50 years and are happy but I want to clarify that it is my step mother. I know this point has nothing to do with our conversation but I assume someone may read our exchange and try to play \u2018gotcha\u2019 with me so I want to address it now.\n\nI\u2019d say it is best that we both retreat from this conversation bc, although, I do not intend on this getting heated or offensive for either of us, I recognize that it may.\n\nBest of luck!\u270c\ufe0f",

Have you been asleep the last year?\n\nAs far as, hormones for teens, the only real objection that Conservatives have is giving them to people who are minors and in early stage of growth. If young people are deemed incapable of \u2018legally\u2019 making most complex decisions (sex, alcohol, liabilities, etc.) for themselves due to age and maturity then something like that is no different and can have life long consequences. Giving them at too young of an age can have irreversible affect. If we were talking about a tattoo that could be removed that is one thing.\n\nLook at Jazz Jennings! They gave her hormones at a young age and she was restricted from having the preferred surgical method to transition due to lack of full male organ growth. It caused them to use the least preferred which caused other complications and hygiene issues. Not to mention, she put on a massive amount of weight which can cause serious health problems. No one else in their family has that issue, and yet, the one taking hormones did, you can\u2019t tell me the hormones weren\u2019t a factor. These are some of the more tame problems that can result from it. \n\nThey, also, don\u2019t believe parents should make it for them as it it a very personal choice and shouldn\u2019t be in the hands of others. Once a person reaches age of majority then people are free to do as they please.\n\nYoung people are given to impulsivity and rash decisions, at least, if, they make a decision at a more informed and mature age then it is one they have to accept as their own.\n\nRegardless, refusing hormone treatment that\u2019s an elective decision and not the result of a life threatening disease is hardly harmful.",

I am not going to get into a long drawn out autobiography, but, simply, being white, male, and hetero who is perfectly comfortable with his biological sex does not equate to privilege despite what some will argue.\n\nRepublicans do not \u201cactively create suffering for marginalized individuals,\u201d that is a fallacy and one of the points I was addressing when I talked about misinformation. Spin doctors will make anything sound tragic and create outrage bc THEY are the ones profiting from it and we all lose in the end. \n\nSome of the things that certain people over sensationalize as \u2018suffering\u2019 are hardly that and diminish those who are truly suffering. Limitations on entitlements and issues that, in themselves, are privileges are being conflated with rights and/or suffering. This is a broad statement and not, necessarily, aimed at the Trans community.\n\nI am not saying that kind of person does not exist\u2026there are a lot of types of people that I couldn\u2019t imagine being\u2026a serial killer for example \u2026but we all know they exist. It\u2019s not cognitive dissonance unless I am conflicted or feel anxiety from it.

Biological women find themselves on the receiving end of those in similar fashion. Having said that, I don\u2019t doubt that there are many that are specific to being Trans.\n\nAs in any social or romantic situation there are predators and no matter what we do there will always be. The only thing we can hope for is they get caught and are held accountable. Every law we have on the matter fully protects any individual no matter what category or position they find themselves in. It\u2019s just the application of those laws that can, at times, be lopsided. I\u2019d contend that the gap in application is diminishing more and more every day, which, I am glad to see.\n\nMy mother, my brother (who I chat with near daily), and my cousin (who is like a brother) are all gay and my nephew is Trans. We don\u2019t, normally, have these conversations which is why I appreciate this one.\n\nI referred in one of my other comments to my parents who have different political ideologies, have been married for 50 years and are happy but I want to clarify that it is my step mother. I know this point has nothing to do with our conversation but I assume someone may read our exchange and try to play \u2018gotcha\u2019 with me so I want to address it now.\n\nI\u2019d say it is best that we both retreat from this conversation bc, although, I do not intend on this getting heated or offensive for either of us, I recognize that it may.\n\nBest of luck!\u270c\ufe0f",

Have you been asleep the last year?\n\nAs far as, hormones for teens, the only real objection that Conservatives have is giving them to people who are minors and in early stage of growth. If young people are deemed incapable of \u2018legally\u2019 making most complex decisions (sex, alcohol, liabilities, etc.) for themselves due to age and maturity then something like that is no different and can have life long consequences. Giving them at too young of an age can have irreversible affect. If we were talking about a tattoo that could be removed that is one thing.\n\nLook at Jazz Jennings! They gave her hormones at a young age and she was restricted from having the preferred surgical method to transition due to lack of full male organ growth. It caused them to use the least preferred which caused other complications and hygiene issues. Not to mention, she put on a massive amount of weight which can cause serious health problems. No one else in their family has that issue, and yet, the one taking hormones did, you can\u2019t tell me the hormones weren\u2019t a factor. These are some of the more tame problems that can result from it. \n\nThey, also, don\u2019t believe parents should make it for them as it it a very personal choice and shouldn\u2019t be in the hands of others. Once a person reaches age of majority then people are free to do as they please.\n\nYoung people are given to impulsivity and rash decisions, at least, if, they make a decision at a more informed and mature age then it is one they have to accept as their own.\n\nRegardless, refusing hormone treatment that\u2019s an elective decision and not the result of a life threatening disease is hardly harmful.",

I am not going to get into a long drawn out autobiography, but, simply, being white, male, and hetero who is perfectly comfortable with his biological sex does not equate to privilege despite what some will argue.\n\nRepublicans do not \u201cactively create suffering for marginalized individuals,\u201d that is a fallacy and one of the points I was addressing when I talked about misinformation. Spin doctors will make anything sound tragic and create outrage bc THEY are the ones profiting from it and we all lose in the end. \n\nSome of the things that certain people over sensationalize as \u2018suffering\u2019 are hardly that and diminish those who are truly suffering. Limitations on entitlements and issues that, in themselves, are privileges are being conflated with rights and/or suffering. This is a broad statement and not, necessarily, aimed at the Trans community.\n\nI am not saying that kind of person does not exist\u2026there are a lot of types of people that I couldn\u2019t imagine being\u2026a serial killer for example \u2026but we all know they exist. It\u2019s not cognitive dissonance unless I am conflicted or feel anxiety from it. Which I don\u2019t!\n\nI don\u2019t doubt your experiences, appreciate them and your willingness to share.\n\nI would, also, say that, at least, some of your experiences are less about you being Trans and more about the dynamic when it comes to SR. Biological women find themselves on the receiving end of those in similar fashion. Having said that, I don\u2019t doubt that there are many that are specific to being Trans.\n\nAs in any social or romantic situation there are predators and no matter what we do there will always be. The only thing we can hope for is they get caught and are held accountable. Every law we have on the matter fully protects any individual no matter what category or position they find themselves in. It\u2019s just the application of those laws that can, at times, be lopsided. I\u2019d contend that the gap in application is diminishing more and more every day, which, I am glad to see.\n\nMy mother, my brother (who I chat with near daily), and my cousin (who is like a brother) are all gay and my nephew is Trans. We don\u2019t, normally, have these conversations which is why I appreciate this one.\n\nI referred in one of my other comments to my parents who have different political ideologies, have been married for 50 years and are happy but I want to clarify that it is my step mother. I know this point has nothing to do with our conversation but I assume someone may read our exchange and try to play \u2018gotcha\u2019 with me so I want to address it now.\n\nI\u2019d say it is best that we both retreat from this conversation bc, although, I do not intend on this getting heated or offensive for either of us, I recognize that it may.\n\nBest of luck!\u270c\ufe0f",

Have you been asleep the last year?\n\nAs far as, hormones for teens, the only real objection that Conservatives have is giving them to people who are minors and in early stage of growth. If young people are deemed incapable of \u2018legally\u2019 making most complex decisions (sex, alcohol, liabilities, etc.) for themselves due to age and maturity then something like that is no different and can have life long consequences. Giving them at too young of an age can have irreversible affect. If we were talking about a tattoo that could be removed that is one thing.\n\nLook at Jazz Jennings! They gave her hormones at a young age and she was restricted from having the preferred surgical method to transition due to lack of full male organ growth. It caused them to use the least preferred which caused other complications and hygiene issues. Not to mention, she put on a massive amount of weight which can cause serious health problems. No one else in their family has that issue, and yet, the one taking hormones did, you can\u2019t tell me the hormones weren\u2019t a factor. These are some of the more tame problems that can result from it. \n\nThey, also, don\u2019t believe parents should make it for them as it it a very personal choice and shouldn\u2019t be in the hands of others. Once a person reaches age of majority then people are free to do as they please.\n\nYoung people are given to impulsivity and rash decisions, at least, if, they make a decision at a more informed and mature age then it is one they have to accept as their own.\n\nRegardless, refusing hormone treatment that\u2019s an elective decision and not the result of a life threatening disease is hardly harmful.",

I am not going to get into a long drawn out autobiography, but, simply, being white, male, and hetero who is perfectly comfortable with his biological sex does not equate to privilege despite what some will argue.\n\nRepublicans do not \u201cactively create suffering for marginalized individuals,\u201d that is a fallacy and one of the points I was addressing when I talked about misinformation. Spin doctors will make anything sound tragic and create outrage bc THEY are the ones profiting from it and we all lose in the end. \n\nSome of the things that certain people over sensationalize as \u2018suffering\u2019 are hardly that and diminish those who are truly suffering. Limitations on entitlements and issues that, in themselves, are privileges are being conflated with rights and/or suffering. This is a broad statement and not, necessarily, aimed at the Trans community.\n\nI am not saying that kind of person does not exist\u2026there are a lot of types of people that I couldn\u2019t imagine being\u2026a serial killer for example \u2026but we all know they exist. It\u2019s not cognitive dissonance unless I am conflicted or feel anxiety from it. Which I don\u2019t!\n\nI don\u2019t doubt your experiences, appreciate them and your willingness to share.\n\nI would, also, say that, at least, some of your experiences are less about you being Trans and more about the dynamic when it comes to SR. Biological women find themselves on the receiving end of those in similar fashion. Having said that, I don\u2019t doubt that there are many that are specific to being Trans.\n\nAs in any social or romantic situation there are predators and no matter what we do there will always be. The only thing we can hope for is they get caught and are held accountable. Every law we have on the matter fully protects any individual no matter what category or position they find themselves in. It\u2019s just the application of those laws that can, at times, be lopsided. I\u2019d contend that the gap in application is diminishing more and more every day, which, I am glad to see.\n\nMy mother, my brother (who I chat with near daily), and my cousin (who is like a brother) are all gay and my nephew is Trans. We don\u2019t, normally, have these conversations which is why I appreciate this one.\n\nI referred in one of my other comments to my parents who have different political ideologies, have been married for 50 years and are happy but I want to clarify that it is my step mother. I know this point has nothing to do with our conversation but I assume someone may read our exchange and try to play \u2018gotcha\u2019 with me so I want to address it now.\n\nI\u2019d say it is best that we both retreat from this conversation bc, although, I do not intend on this getting heated or offensive for either of us, I recognize that it may.\n\nBest of luck!\u270c\ufe0f",

The issue is that pro-lifers consider the growth in the woman's womb to be an individual human life rather than a growth with a potential to be a human life. If you look at it from their perspective, albeit wrong, their argument is logically consistent. \n\nThe vast majority of Americans support some abortion restrictions, which most also supporting legalized abortion. For instance, I do not support partial birth abortion, though I am pro choice and support free on demand abortions provided by the state for at least the first 2 trimesters. \n\nIt's hard to define specifically when the growth in the woman's body is an \"independent life\" and that's the crux of the issue. The pro-life side sees the growth as being an \"independent life\" at the moment of conception and therefore think abortion is murdering a baby.
