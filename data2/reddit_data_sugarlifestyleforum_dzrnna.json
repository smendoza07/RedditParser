I think it\u2019s the best and most honest way for us to feel that compatibility.\u201d\n\nLike really ? Just gross.\nI get wanting to see compatibility but like meet me get to know me ? \nI\u2019m really starting to hate the site",

            "body": "Just going to throw in my unsolicited two-cents here...\n\nFor me, a successful arrangement seamlessly blends aspects of vanilla dating with the more unorthodox elements of sugaring. We call it sugar relationship/dating for a reason. \n\nMaintaining civility/sociability is one of the utmost priorities in an arrangement. No (sane) person wants to feel like a sex toy or something expendable, we want other facets of our personality to shine through. Plus, there\u2019s the added pressure of being in a niche social milieu (sugar dating) which already is deemed anti-social/immoral/destructive by larger society. \n\nWhen someone proposes intimacy on the first meet it kills the illusion, the pageantry, necessary to sustain the belief I\u2019m dating someone as I would in a traditional setting. There are no elaborate dating rituals and I know this person is using money as a crutch to supplant the \u201cwork\u201d (charm, seduction, banter, etc.) normally required to get into a woman\u2019s pants.\n\nIn short, sugar dating is kind of akin to \u201ccheating\u201d and that becomes more obvious when someone proposes sex without meeting. \n\nSo men, have some self-respect and at least try to seem as though you\u2019re interested in putting in the work.",

Of course there\u2019s a monetary component, otherwise it wouldn\u2019t be an arrangement.  And I don\u2019t think one has to be a \u201chooker\u201d in order to agree to intimacy right away, under the proper circumstances. I\u2019ve had a couple of lovely yet brief M & Gs in the caf\u00e9 of a very nice hotel, and once the arrangement terms were set and provided, I was more than happy to go upstairs with him.  And the whole point of having an arrangement is so one doesn\u2019t have to \u201cwork\u201d quite so hard at getting what he very much desires.  Yes, definitely don\u2019t be \u201cgross\u201c about it, but I don\u2019t want \u201cpageantry\u201d or \u201cillusions\u201d... I much prefer respectful authenticity.",

Of course you have to be genuine and respectful but an arrangement is, inherently, not a traditional relationship. \n\nThe best arrangements (in my opinion) are the ones where it doesn\u2019t feel like an arrangement. Civility and a bit of humanity go a long way towards accomplishing that end.\n\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t think one has to be a hooker...\u201d\n\nNever said that, never implied that. \n\nIf you\u2019re fine with sex on the first meet and you don\u2019t feel cheapened or whatnot by the interaction, by all means go ahead - no one\u2019s interfering with your preferences. For me (any many others), however, it\u2019s a turn-off for the aforementioned reasons.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had lovely yet brief M&G...\u201d\n\nDoes that not count as work? Or the texting/online interaction prior to your meeting? I doubt you\u2019d have wanted to jump into bed with this person if some modicum of effort wasn\u2019t put into courtship. \n\nYes, it\u2019s not at the same magnitude of \u201cwork\u201d in a traditional setting but you still need to engage with the other person, whether it\u2019s in feigned interest or not (and usually arrangements predicated entirely on false sincerity do not last).",

What if I asked you to a casual m&g will you still ask me for a 100? All this practice does is create opportunities for scams, which again you did not address. I _may_ give you some money before the arrangement but only if I felt that the time spent was worthwhile and I really liked you a lot. You on the other hand are requiring me to _compensate_ you. There is a difference between a _tip_ and compensation. \n\nAlso if you truly valued romance you would not be on the bowl.

I am more than happy going on a hike, going to a taco place, or a coffee shop on a first date where the bill is <20$ or even free and i'm not spending 2 hours at the gym and 2 hours getting ready etc (nails, hair, shave half my body, makeup etc). A man gets the pleasure and status of being seen out with a beautiful SB. So when a man thinks it is enough to just take her on a nice date and call it even.. that is called a regular date. I get taken on nice dates by non SD's too and I prepare for \"regular dates\" way differently with way less investment.\n\nI think some of the SDs on here who are uptight about money don't understand what it takes to be a high value woman. The financial investment, the time, the manners, being educated, cultured, having the right look, being a quality woman, being the woman they want. This is a 24/7 job, and I want someone who sees the value in that. Not every man sees the value, and they are looking for a hookup or a prostitute (no shame), where that stuff isn't as important.\n\nI try to know my market and my market value to \\*those men\\*, assess supply and demand, and make my decisions based on that. \n\nI will admit that I am also looking for a man that I love... I am looking for the whole package, as I am sure many men on here are as well. I am not shy about that. To a man that is uptight about money and not generous..we will not do well together. To a generous man that has an eye for class and sophistication, enjoys conversation, and loyalty, I will show you appreciation, respect, (and in some cases submission), in my highest capacity..",

If everything checks out then you could move on with the arrangement. \n\nBut you don\u2019t want that. You want to be wooed then get paid for it too. Tell me does your vanilla date pay you a hundred too if you go out on an \u201cextravagant\u201d date? Sugardating is supposed to be an alternative to vanilla dating yet you managed to  combine the tedious aspect of vanilla dating and choose to charge the SD for it too! Lol. This is not a question of generosity, but trust.\n\nPerhaps you\u2019re looking for your very own 50shades fantasy, and that is fine. I just don\u2019t see how you folks care so much what a _majority_ of SDs are looking for.

This is a form of dating, and dating nearly always has the end goal of sexual intimacy. \n\nThe concern I actually had in mind while writing my original comment was more geared toward crass approaches from SD\u2019s. But that ultimately boils down to my personal opinion and style in dating. \n\nThank you all for not charging at me with torches and spears. I\u2019m exploring and learning! LOL!",

I doubt you\u2019d have wanted to jump into bed with this person if some modicum of effort wasn\u2019t put into courtship. \n\nYes, it\u2019s not at the same magnitude of \u201cwork\u201d in a traditional setting but you still need to engage with the other person, whether it\u2019s in feigned interest or not (and usually arrangements predicated entirely on false sincerity do not last).",

However when he fails to fully grasp the fact you have taken it off the table then he is the problem and you have recognized the problem before investing the time.

You get to size me up and I get to size you up. Of course the \u201cdate\u201d is on my expense as well as your travel cost. Beyond that continuing a platonic date for the sake of having the date is pointless. It\u2019s either you\u2019re a fit or you\u2019re not. The endgame for the SD is intimacy, if it\u2019s not going to happen then it\u2019s no bueno.\n\nThe argument stands, does a prospective employer compensate you for an interview?",

Or are you going to come to the date, show me your bank statements, your taxes reports, the papers of your properties under your name, your criminal record and also, there is a place on the internet where another SB's would be giving reviews about you saying how great is to be with you, how generous you were etc?

It\u2019s the physicality/chemistry of it that you\u2019re exploring. It\u2019s whether the 500 from me is something acceptable for you or would you rather get that 500 from someone else. I don\u2019t get review about you either. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re a flake/rinser/goldminer but that\u2019s a risk I\u2019m taking by starting an arrangement with you. And the first action you show me is that I have to compensate you for something that is no mutually beneficial? Give you 100 and you have no obligation to meet me the next time, literally the modus operandi of a rinser. That\u2019s how you want to build trust? Okay. Hard Pass.

What if I asked you to a casual m&g will you still ask me for a 100? All this practice does is create opportunities for scams, which again you did not address. I _may_ give you some money before the arrangement but only if I felt that the time spent was worthwhile and I really liked you a lot. You on the other hand are requiring me to _compensate_ you. There is a difference between a _tip_ and compensation. \n\nAlso if you truly valued romance you would not be on the bowl. Please don\u2019t give me that bs about \u201cvaluing\u201d you more. 99% of the men in SA are there because of what is between your legs.

For me (any many others), however, it\u2019s a turn-off for the aforementioned reasons.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had lovely yet brief M&G...\u201d\n\nDoes that not count as work? Or the texting/online interaction prior to your meeting?

I _may_ give you some money before the arrangement but only if I felt that the time spent was worthwhile and I really liked you a lot. You on the other hand are requiring me to _compensate_ you.

I _may_ give you some money before the arrangement but only if I felt that the time spent was worthwhile and I really liked you a lot. You on the other hand are requiring me to _compensate_ you.

I _may_ give you some money before the arrangement but only if I felt that the time spent was worthwhile and I really liked you a lot. You on the other hand are requiring me to _compensate_ you. There is a difference between a _tip_ and compensation. \n\nAlso if you truly valued romance you would not be on the bowl.

You did not address the question about trust still. You still obligated me to give you money ahead of time with no guarantee on your part that I will see you again. And no one asked you to dress up. What if I asked you to a casual m&g will you still ask me for a 100? All this practice does is create opportunities for scams, which again you did not address. I _may_ give you some money before the arrangement but only if I felt that the time spent was worthwhile and I really liked you a lot. You on the other hand are requiring me to _compensate_ you. There is a difference between a _tip_ and compensation. \n\nAlso if you truly valued romance you would not be on the bowl. Please don\u2019t give me that bs about \u201cvaluing\u201d you more. 99% of the men in SA are there because of what is between your legs.

What if I asked you to a casual m&g will you still ask me for a 100? All this practice does is create opportunities for scams, which again you did not address. I _may_ give you some money before the arrangement but only if I felt that the time spent was worthwhile and I really liked you a lot. You on the other hand are requiring me to _compensate_ you. There is a difference between a _tip_ and compensation. \n\nAlso if you truly valued romance you would not be on the bowl. Please don\u2019t give me that bs about \u201cvaluing\u201d you more. 99% of the men in SA are there because of what is between your legs.

You still obligated me to give you money ahead of time with no guarantee on your part that I will see you again. And no one asked you to dress up. What if I asked you to a casual m&g will you still ask me for a 100? All this practice does is create opportunities for scams, which again you did not address. I _may_ give you some money before the arrangement but only if I felt that the time spent was worthwhile and I really liked you a lot. You on the other hand are requiring me to _compensate_ you. There is a difference between a _tip_ and compensation. \n\nAlso if you truly valued romance you would not be on the bowl. Please don\u2019t give me that bs about \u201cvaluing\u201d you more. 99% of the men in SA are there because of what is between your legs.
