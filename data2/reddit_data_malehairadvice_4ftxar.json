Aside from the maintenance, there's the hair getting stuck behind your back, tangled while sleeping, the seat belt eats it, it's fucking HEAVY, takes days to dry, you blow through shampoo and conditioner like there's no tomorrow, I could go on, but clearly you've been there, done that, and threw the t-shirt away. \n\nDown with hair guilt, I'm glad you went ahead with chopping it, and I wish you a cool summer. I just got a ton of layers put in my massive mane myself, and the difference is night and day! \n\nTl:Dr don't apologize, you look great! ",
