    "body": "Man, way too many people completely misunderstand the SD/SB dynamic \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nHad our first trip planned for my SB of three months: a nice resort getaway where we were going to get pampered, eat too much, drink a bunch, and have a lot of intimacy. I had a whole week of activities planned out with a four-star hotel.\n\nBut she canceled. Fourth time in six months. \n\nI like to think of myself as an understanding guy. Death in the family? Of course. Sudden illness? I'm there with chicken soup. But her reason for canceling was her friend from out of town was visiting and that only happens \"like once a year\" \ud83d\ude44.\n\nI'd been chatting with another woman seeking a good arrangement before I met her. I hit this woman up again about a M&G. She was super eager to go. Showed up looking cute as a button. Took her on our first date a few days later and explained the situation: previous SB just canceled on me for our trip and I know it's way too early to be appropriate to ask, but if she wanted to go. She seemed hesitant but said she did have some summer vacation left and nothing in particular to do.\n\nWe went and had a blast. I was a gentleman: got her a separate room for the first couple of days so she could get a feel for it. Day three she started staying with me. Absolute fireworks from that point on.\n\nCame home and was open with the previous SB. \"Sorry, met someone else. Hope you had fun with your friend.\" And she was furious. What the fuck man? Are we married? Sorry been there and done that. Never again.\n\nOne of the more ridiculous things a SB has pulled on me. It always seems to happen at the three month mark too. Not sure what's with that.",

The only reason I care is because I get sick of the whiny little girls coming on this forum, bitching because they can't find a sugar daddy when they have literally nothing to offer except their looks. So you're pretty... big deal, bitch! So are the hundreds of other girls on Seeking. My post was saying that these girls bring nothing to the table, yet they think because they have gotten by in life so far it will be more of the same here. But since men have the money, and there are dozens upon dozens of women from them to chose from in this scenario,the script is flipped, and many of these chicks just plain can't handle it. THAT'S the ego tripping I was referring to.",

People often (usually) blow up when sex, money, and love is involved; I'm often reminded of children throwing temper tantrums. If you can handle those temper tantrums then it's probably ok to communicate but maybe a soft ghost is more prudent the rest of the time.\n\nI do think people often inappropriately have temper tantrums in SR's because that's practically expected in a normal non-monetary relationship, at least in the beginning. Hurting is caring and all that jazz. But who has time or energy for that in an SR?",

So you're pretty... big deal, bitch! So are the hundreds of other girls on Seeking. My post was saying that these girls bring nothing to the table, yet they think because they have gotten by in life so far it will be more of the same here. But since men have the money, and there are dozens upon dozens of women from them to chose from in this scenario,the script is flipped, and many of these chicks just plain can't handle it. THAT'S the ego tripping I was referring to.",

The only reason I care is because I get sick of the whiny little girls coming on this forum, bitching because they can't find a sugar daddy when they have literally nothing to offer except their looks. So you're pretty... big deal, bitch! So are the hundreds of other girls on Seeking. My post was saying that these girls bring nothing to the table, yet they think because they have gotten by in life so far it will be more of the same here. But since men have the money, and there are dozens upon dozens of women from them to chose from in this scenario,the script is flipped, and many of these chicks just plain can't handle it. THAT'S the ego tripping I was referring to.",

My post was saying that these girls bring nothing to the table, yet they think because they have gotten by in life so far it will be more of the same here.

There's nothing delusional about the fact that there are far more SBs out there than SDs. In the standard dating market, the number of men seeking a hot woman significantly outnumbers the number of women seeking a hot man.\n\nIn that scenario, women get their pick of the litter.

It is what it is and it doesn't mean you're less valuable as a person. It's just different from normal dating is all.\n\nYou kind of strike me as the type who hasn't had the greatest experiences with SDs. It makes me wonder what you're still doing here trying so hard to find your Prince Charming, but if you'll excuse me I have to make dinner reservations for tomorrow night.

So you're pretty... big deal, bitch! So are the hundreds of other girls on Seeking. My post was saying that these girls bring nothing to the table, yet they think because they have gotten by in life so far it will be more of the same here. But since men have the money, and there are dozens upon dozens of women from them to chose from in this scenario,the script is flipped, and many of these chicks just plain can't handle it.

There's a reason why after making this post I got messages from four SBs asking where I live and if I was interested in an SA with them. It is what it is and it doesn't mean you're less valuable as a person. It's just different from normal dating is all.\n\nYou kind of strike me as the type who hasn't had the greatest experiences with SDs. It makes me wonder what you're still doing here trying so hard to find your Prince Charming, but if you'll excuse me I have to make dinner reservations for tomorrow night.
