    "body": "A few weeks ago I was bored and stuck at home on my days off from work. I decided , just for fun to sign up for Facebook dating ( ok you can stop laughing ). I didn't expect anything or believe it was a legit way to meet anyone. I honestly wanted to see what sort of train wrecks and weird messages I would receive. Let me tell you, it was a gold mine of awkward opening lines and guys that I'm 100% positive are doing meth ( missing teeth, sunken cheeks, sores). It passes the time at least. Well, about 3 hours after I get a message from a very good looking man. I check his profile out and like me, he had just signed up. No weird creepy message just \" Hey, your profile caught my eye, thought I'd say hello\".  I responded and we clicked. That night we talked on the phone for 8 hours. I'm thinking there is no way he is legit, no way he will follow through with any thing he has said. Well, to my surprise, he did. \n\nLong story short, here we are a month later, dating. He calls and texts, I never wonder if I'm going to hear from him. He calls me just because he wants to hear my voice. He texts me just to tell me he is thinking about me. He has a great job, his own house, was in the Navy and is hot. He is crazy about me and I am crazy about him. When we spend time together , I'm comfortable. It's definitely a feeling of this what people mean when they say they found the one that feels like coming home, and you know you are finally safe.  When I got into the bowl , I never thought I'd want to give it up, that no man would be worth giving up the freedom , I was having so much fun. However, now I couldn't imagine giving him up for the bowl. What I have with him is a million times better than any amount of money or fancy dinners or expensive gifts and knowing that my relationships with my SD's will never go any where. Don't get me wrong, the SD's I've had are amazing men, I care about them immensely and will miss them. It was hard to tell them we have to stop. I will be forever grateful for their presence in my life. They taught me to raise my standards and not settle. \n\nI'm cautiously optimistic with my guy, I know a month isn't a long time and things could change but I have faith and I feel secure. Excited to see where we end up. Just wanted to share.",
