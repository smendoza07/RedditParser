    "body": "This post is for my sisters in the bowl that I see complaining about a lack of offers/casual discrimination on Seeking. \n\nThere are two things you should keep in mind:\n1. We have a lot of negative stereotypes working against us. No, it\u2019s not fair. Yes, it sucks. It\u2019s still how it is.\n2. And because of this, we often have to work twice as hard to get half of what they get.\n\nHow does this translate into your success on SA? It means you need to do everything to disassociate yourself with those negative stereotypes.\n\nWhat do I mean with this?\n\u2192 The grammar. Proofread. Proofread again. And again, make sure the grammar in your profile is impeccable. The non-black SB has \u201can unpolished profile\u201d. You are \u201cghetto/ratchet\u201d. \n\n\u2192 No mention of \u201cmelanin\u201d, \u201cchocolate\u201d, \u201cgoddess\u201d, \u201cqueen\u201d, \u201cbaby\u201d, \u201cprincess\u201d, \u201cspoil\u201d in your profile or your username.\n\n\u2192 Avoid the Fashion Nova clothes or \u201cthot\u201d (God, do I hate this word) wear. So, we forget about: neon jumpsuits, biker shorts, huge brands everywhere, etc.\n\n\u2192 This is gonna be touchy. But stay fit. I know some will get upset about this. But obesity is often associated with us. You are drastically reducing your pool on Seeking by having a few pounds extra. \n\n\u2192 Leave the (bad) frontals, colorful wigs and braids, 30-inches long weaves at home. Experiment with classy styles for your natural hair. Wear classy protective styles, ex. [1](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/91/bc/4c/91bc4ca26fa41084c0a0e17b9be80572.jpg) [2](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1767/9375/files/big_cornrows_large.jpg?v=1586939789) [3 ](https://ath2.unileverservices.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/10/bob-twists-saythelees.jpg)\n\n\u2192 STOP lowballing yourself. Being black is not a curse. You should never ever take less because of your race. You are worth so much more than that.\n\n\u2192 Your personality is your second best asset in the bowl. No entitlement. Show gratitude. Cultivate your mind. A beautiful intelligent charismatic woman can get *almost* everything she wants in life.\n\n\nWe are overrepresented in the bowl. The sugar daddies who are open to date us or fetishise us will take the best of the best (the ones doing what I said here above) leaving those who do not on the site wondering why they are struggling.\n\nEdit: I see a lot of people thinking I meant braids are not okay. Of course they are! I meant the neon, blonde, pink coloured ones. There is nothing wrong with some box braids.",

What I would do when my hair was really short was stay in protective hairstyles (like the ones above) until it was long enough for me to wear natural looking weaves and twists. As my hair grew longer and longer, I was able to wear blowouts and low/high buns (most frequent hairstyle these days). I keep it very simple with nurturing products: aloe vera, shea butter, and olive oil. If you want tips on styling products, dm me. It all depends on how short your hair is.",

And as I said before, a lot of these SDs are looking for a specific presentation - and although there are those who like, want, and are attracted to a very ethnic look, a vast majority are not. The more refined look (which is subjective) THEY are after doesnt always fit the mold that us black women fall into...and to some, braids (like in those pics) are not what they consider refined. Granted if that is a looking an SB chooses to wear - then obviously THAT SD that doesnt like it isnt her target! Cool. \n\nFor example: my first SD was Caribbean. So when I wore anything that wasnt natural (in his viewpoint), he didnt like it...so my natural curls were his fav, protective styles were also to his liking - esp my passion twists. Whenever I wore a lacefront, he would give me a speech on being 'fake'. Another SD/POT was a white man from Oregon. He invited me to a black tie, $2k per plate, benefit gala with top level exec's and their dates...trust and believe I wasnt going to rock any cornrow braids! A professionally installed RPG lacefront was the look of choice...he loved it and so did I. The refinement involved in both relationships was based on the type of SD i was with, and the location...\n\n\nEDIT:  I knew a black girl who was not in shape, spoke like \"bruh\"...all the time, and would wear pink, green, rainbow ombre wigs and wore 3\" coffin nails with very loud designs. And yes, she had an SD - and she bragged about that all day everyday! But trust and believe, he was NOT the caliber I would ever aim for. \ud83d\ude33. He was most def not the exec type I typically attract...and if I carried myself like her, I never WOULD attract.",

            "body": "First, I\u2019m a mixed SB. Just letting y\u2019all know so I have firsthand experience of this \u2014 I do believe you\u2019re correct on some things, but I\u2019ve a few minor suggestions.\n\n1. No wealthy, white man is going to want to bring you to an expensive restaurant if you\u2019re rocking a natural style unless it\u2019s a blow out or relaxer. Let\u2019s be real, ladies, these men are in their 50s-60s and the few black women they seen and probably were attracted to in their lifetime had hair that was fried to death. When an older white AND black man (I know y\u2019all have heard what men in your neighborhood have said to natural girls in passing) sees a young lady running around with untamed curls, they assume she is lazy and doesn\u2019t have anywhere important to be. As for braids, oh god, girls come on! I know it\u2019s a good protective style but either it looks too childish, or in the case of straight back braids, it makes you look like you\u2019re doing a bid or you\u2019re a man. I\u2019m just being honest.\n\n2. Wear WIGS, straight wigs, body wave wigs! Additionally, you don\u2019t have to limit yourself to just black. I primarily wear 613 lacefronts with dark roots, and most men think it is my hair, it probably helps that I\u2019m a lighter complexion due to having a white parent, but I\u2019ve seen girls with tons of melanin look astounding with brown, bleach blonde/honey blonde, deep auburn hair so long as they get the dark roots. They make a world of difference - most men even ask if it\u2019s my hair and I need my roots done, lol, but it looks ten times better having that darker base on natural colors to sort of avoid that white lace look a lot of girls have going on when wearing light colored wigs.\n\n3. Clothes. I am slim thick and dress like a fashion nova thot and I am proud! Men love it, ladies. Don\u2019t feel like you have to go to banana republic and buy an expensive shapeless sack that even your grandma would look at and say \u201cHell no\u201d. If you have curves, embrace them! Accentuate them in FN cocktail dresses, and show that cleavage! I\u2019m not saying to walk in with nipple jumping out Everytime you move and a dress that just nearly passes your kitty, but, honestly, I have before and it usually works wonders with YOUNGER guys. Older guys I still dress form fitting but a little bit more refined in terms of length of the dress, because no man wants to be seated across a woman wearing something baggy. That\u2019s an immediate red flag - he thinks she must be trying to conceal something, I\u2019ve heard it so many times from men, no loose clothes!\n\n4. She didn\u2019t even touch on makeup. But, listen, I do my makeup like Ari \u2014 gigantic lashes, the baked foundation trick, the aggressively arched eyebrows with highlighter under, but I tend to do a more subtle contour. The fact is, men will ALWAYS say \u201cI want to see you with no makeup\u201d, but they have no idea what no makeup looks like. Like at all. Your best bet is to just throw on your smaller lashes, still fill in your brows, full foundation and baking with no contour or highlighter, and they\u2019ll think that\u2019s natural lol.\n\nThe fact of the matter is: yes, there are stereotypes that our people are overweight, rude, and disruptive... However, there is also the stereotype inspired by so many celebrities for the last like 20 years of the vixen. Remember, sugar daddies are men and men like sex. Therefore, he likes people that are sexy. Do not go for the bookish college student look with no makeup, natural hairstyle, big glasses, and loose fitting clothes. Embrace your inner Dorothy Dandridge or even Noami Campbell if you\u2019re a tall/skinny girl, wear the voluminous weave, acryliced nails, tight clothes, makeup, and be sexy. Don\u2019t look like a stripper, but still be you. It is known that confidence is very seductive. So, don\u2019t make yourself look like Lauren Hill if that\u2019s not you, because masquerading can get exhausting and you will eventually meet your breaking point.",

The bowl calls for transparency, honesty and a sense of directness which at times can be hard to receive, especially when it comes to black women.\n\nThis post is honest, direct and transparent in relaying the stereotypes most black women face and I think it's a fair middle ground (especially the bit on wearing simple protective styles) on how to overcome or deal with it when taking part in the bowl. I think the biggest takeaway from this post, is grounding your mind and spirit in love and having self-belief (then in turn confidence) in who you are and want to be.\n\nThis is sound advice in general for such a delicate topic but obviously it doesn't hold weight for some of you and that's honestly great (we all know black women are not a monolith)! But keep in mind, whatever niche you're in may work for you but may not work for someone else. So I say, if what you're doing doesn't seem to be clicking for you maybe tackle one thing off this advice-post and see if anything changes for you. \ud83d\ude47\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

This separation creates a lack of familiarity and a \"fear of the unknown\".  Many middle aged White men find Black women attractive, but due to their lack of familiarity, assume most Black women would not be interested in a White man or are \"ghetto\".   \n\nI've introduced Black SBs I've dated to some of my mostly White middle aged friends.

This is our biggest marketable crowd.\nBut, most of them aren\u2019t black, meaning they aren\u2019t familiar with the culture aside from what they see in the general media and are influenced by our current beauty standards (those being Euro-centric), which results in them not being appealed by certain things (i.e colourful braids).\n\n3) SDs who specifically look for black SBs. Small crowd and gets taken really fast. These will talk to you, braids or no braids. But like I said they are a small crowd.",

As an older POT SD I'm often left to pass on profiles that require me to go to urban dictionary to look up terms.  That happens on certain profiles from all ethnic groups in my experience.  It's kind of off putting to be honest. \n\nThe thing about grammar is, that it's my first impression of you and it doesn't matter if you're the most educated and articulate individual when meeting in person, if you can't use there, their, or they're correctly, or use you're and your correctly, I don't imagine myself being able to having a conversation with you.\n\nFor me, it's not about the ethnicity of the POT.  I honestly don't care if you use melanin or  chocolate in your username but if you use any of the other terms like princess, goddess, queen, spoil, etc. I'm going pass.  I won't even look at profiles with those terms in the username or headline of the profile.\n\nThe one thing this post didn't address is the photos that, to me at least, it seems all young women are using.  Maybe someone can explain this thing about the tongue that I see?  I honestly don't get it.  I don't think it makes you look more provocative or certainly attractive so what am I missing?  Is it an indication of not taking yourself too seriously?  \n\nLastly it's the filters on photos.  I want to see you not a snapchat or instagram filter.  You're all beautiful in your own way and don't need these filters that you're using on your pictures.  At least that's my opinion.",

I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t seen many of those. In my family alone, 4 out of my 5 aunts are married to French white men.\n\nETA: You are very much wrong. I have always conducted myself the way I do now. I have always been \u201cclassy\u201d, and the fact you directly assume a black woman would have to change her demeanour to one that differs from the stereotype attached to us speaks volume.

You talk about me not being allowed to make \u201cgeneralised wide sweeping statements\u201d while making those (1. The one about France, 2. The one about natural hair and protective styles). Also you saying you thought like me at one point but stopped doing so because of a white man, but then turning around and saying that the upvotes don\u2019t matter because they are from white people?

                    "body": "I was referring to Cleo's HAIR style...not her whole look. Sorry if I wasnt clear on that point. And as I said before, a lot of these SDs are looking for a specific presentation - and although there are those who like, want, and are attracted to a very ethnic look, a vast majority are not. The more refined look (which is subjective) THEY are after doesnt always fit the mold that us black women fall into...and to some, braids (like in those pics) are not what they consider refined. Granted if that is a looking an SB chooses to wear - then obviously THAT SD that doesnt like it isnt her target! Cool. \n\nFor example: my first SD was Caribbean. So when I wore anything that wasnt natural (in his viewpoint), he didnt like it...so my natural curls were his fav, protective styles were also to his liking - esp my passion twists. Whenever I wore a lacefront, he would give me a speech on being 'fake'. Another SD/POT was a white man from Oregon. He invited me to a black tie, $2k per plate, benefit gala with top level exec's and their dates...trust and believe I wasnt going to rock any cornrow braids! A professionally installed RPG lacefront was the look of choice...he loved it and so did I. The refinement involved in both relationships was based on the type of SD i was with, and the location...\n\n\nEDIT:  I knew a black girl who was not in shape, spoke like \"bruh\"...all the time, and would wear pink, green, rainbow ombre wigs and wore 3\" coffin nails with very loud designs. And yes, she had an SD - and she bragged about that all day everyday! But trust and believe, he was NOT the caliber I would ever aim for. \ud83d\ude33. He was most def not the exec type I typically attract...and if I carried myself like her, I never WOULD attract.",

I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t seen many of those. In my family alone, 4 out of my 5 aunts are married to French white men.\n\nETA: You are very much wrong. I have always conducted myself the way I do now. I have always been \u201cclassy\u201d, and the fact you directly assume a black woman would have to change her demeanour to one that differs from the stereotype attached to us speaks volume. My mother was the same way. This is how I was raised and how I am. I didn\u2019t \u201cchange\u201d to attract a white man. Every single one of the tips I gave have been something I instilled from day 1 and probably contributed to me always having success in the bowl. You tried to teach me about France, a country you simply visited, while it was my country of RESIDENCE while you tried to imply earlier I must be ignorant about the dynamics in the U.S because I wouldn\u2019t be living there. You talk about me not being allowed to make \u201cgeneralised wide sweeping statements\u201d while making those (1. The one about France, 2. The one about natural hair and protective styles). Also you saying you thought like me at one point but stopped doing so because of a white man, but then turning around and saying that the upvotes don\u2019t matter because they are from white people? Why does the opinion of the white man you met hold more weight than that of these other white people?",

As my hair grew longer and longer, I was able to wear blowouts and low/high buns (most frequent hairstyle these days).

And as I said before, a lot of these SDs are looking for a specific presentation - and although there are those who like, want, and are attracted to a very ethnic look, a vast majority are not. The more refined look (which is subjective) THEY are after doesnt always fit the mold that us black women fall into...and to some, braids (like in those pics) are not what they consider refined. Granted if that is a looking an SB chooses to wear - then obviously THAT SD that doesnt like it isnt her target! Cool. \n\nFor example: my first SD was Caribbean. So when I wore anything that wasnt natural (in his viewpoint), he didnt like it...so my natural curls were his fav, protective styles were also to his liking - esp my passion twists. Whenever I wore a lacefront, he would give me a speech on being 'fake'. Another SD/POT was a white man from Oregon. He invited me to a black tie, $2k per plate, benefit gala with top level exec's and their dates...trust and believe I wasnt going to rock any cornrow braids! A professionally installed RPG lacefront was the look of choice...he loved it and so did I. The refinement involved in both relationships was based on the type of SD i was with, and the location...\n\n\nEDIT:  I knew a black girl who was not in shape, spoke like \"bruh\"...all the time, and would wear pink, green, rainbow ombre wigs and wore 3\" coffin nails with very loud designs. And yes, she had an SD - and she bragged about that all day everyday! But trust and believe, he was NOT the caliber I would ever aim for. \ud83d\ude33. He was most def not the exec type I typically attract...and if I carried myself like her, I never WOULD attract.",

I have always conducted myself the way I do now. I have always been \u201cclassy\u201d, and the fact you directly assume a black woman would have to change her demeanour to one that differs from the stereotype attached to us speaks volume. My mother was the same way. This is how I was raised and how I am. I didn\u2019t \u201cchange\u201d to attract a white man. Every single one of the tips I gave have been something I instilled from day 1 and probably contributed to me always having success in the bowl. You tried to teach me about France, a country you simply visited, while it was my country of RESIDENCE while you tried to imply earlier I must be ignorant about the dynamics in the U.S because I wouldn\u2019t be living there. You talk about me not being allowed to make \u201cgeneralised wide sweeping statements\u201d while making those (1. The one about France, 2. The one about natural hair and protective styles). Also you saying you thought like me at one point but stopped doing so because of a white man, but then turning around and saying that the upvotes don\u2019t matter because they are from white people? Why does the opinion of the white man you met hold more weight than that of these other white people?",

What I would do when my hair was really short was stay in protective hairstyles (like the ones above) until it was long enough for me to wear natural looking weaves and twists. As my hair grew longer and longer, I was able to wear blowouts and low/high buns (most frequent hairstyle these days).

I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t seen many of those. In my family alone, 4 out of my 5 aunts are married to French white men.\n\nETA: You are very much wrong. I have always conducted myself the way I do now. I have always been \u201cclassy\u201d, and the fact you directly assume a black woman would have to change her demeanour to one that differs from the stereotype attached to us speaks volume. My mother was the same way. This is how I was raised and how I am. I didn\u2019t \u201cchange\u201d to attract a white man. Every single one of the tips I gave have been something I instilled from day 1 and probably contributed to me always having success in the bowl. You tried to teach me about France, a country you simply visited, while it was my country of RESIDENCE while you tried to imply earlier I must be ignorant about the dynamics in the U.S because I wouldn\u2019t be living there. You talk about me not being allowed to make \u201cgeneralised wide sweeping statements\u201d while making those (1. The one about France, 2. The one about natural hair and protective styles). Also you saying you thought like me at one point but stopped doing so because of a white man, but then turning around and saying that the upvotes don\u2019t matter because they are from white people? Why does the opinion of the white man you met hold more weight than that of these other white people?",

I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t seen many of those. In my family alone, 4 out of my 5 aunts are married to French white men.\n\nETA: You are very much wrong. I have always conducted myself the way I do now. I have always been \u201cclassy\u201d, and the fact you directly assume a black woman would have to change her demeanour to one that differs from the stereotype attached to us speaks volume. My mother was the same way. This is how I was raised and how I am. I didn\u2019t \u201cchange\u201d to attract a white man. Every single one of the tips I gave have been something I instilled from day 1 and probably contributed to me always having success in the bowl. You tried to teach me about France, a country you simply visited, while it was my country of RESIDENCE while you tried to imply earlier I must be ignorant about the dynamics in the U.S because I wouldn\u2019t be living there. You talk about me not being allowed to make \u201cgeneralised wide sweeping statements\u201d while making those (1. The one about France, 2. The one about natural hair and protective styles). Also you saying you thought like me at one point but stopped doing so because of a white man, but then turning around and saying that the upvotes don\u2019t matter because they are from white people? Why does the opinion of the white man you met hold more weight than that of these other white people?",

Black women are dating white men there all the time, especially in Paris. It\u2019s so common we don\u2019t even really call them \u201cinterracial couples\u201d. They\u2019re just couples. I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t seen many of those. In my family alone, 4 out of my 5 aunts are married to French white men.\n\nETA: You are very much wrong. I have always conducted myself the way I do now. I have always been \u201cclassy\u201d, and the fact you directly assume a black woman would have to change her demeanour to one that differs from the stereotype attached to us speaks volume. My mother was the same way. This is how I was raised and how I am. I didn\u2019t \u201cchange\u201d to attract a white man. Every single one of the tips I gave have been something I instilled from day 1 and probably contributed to me always having success in the bowl. You tried to teach me about France, a country you simply visited, while it was my country of RESIDENCE while you tried to imply earlier I must be ignorant about the dynamics in the U.S because I wouldn\u2019t be living there. You talk about me not being allowed to make \u201cgeneralised wide sweeping statements\u201d while making those (1. The one about France, 2. The one about natural hair and protective styles). Also you saying you thought like me at one point but stopped doing so because of a white man, but then turning around and saying that the upvotes don\u2019t matter because they are from white people? Why does the opinion of the white man you met hold more weight than that of these other white people?",
