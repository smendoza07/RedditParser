People who haven\u2019t tried the game before will hate on it for what it is now but we knew the greatness, and we witness it\u2019s downfall.\n\nGames just a shell of its former self, with more collabs than there are organs in my body (not a joke btw) to most likely keep the game in the mainstream.

If worst comes to worst she can release that stored chakra and there's nothing Hinata can do to stop it because it doesn't generate from normal chakra paths.

People here acting like Hinata has superior taijutsu even though Sakura was specifically trained in that aspect by Tsunade. In comparison to the average shinobi, Sakura's taijutsu should still be superior (just look at her taijutsu battle against Shin Uchiha).\n\nThere's also the fact that Sakura stores chakra on her Hyakugou seal. If worst comes to worst she can release that stored chakra and there's nothing Hinata can do to stop it because it doesn't generate from normal chakra paths. It'll be like when Naruto beat Neji by using Kyuubi's chakra.",

I guess it could be a good way to get more people into the fandom, except that naruto already has a very big fandom and again, the fortnite community is generally toxic.",

If worst comes to worst she can release that stored chakra and there's nothing Hinata can do to stop it because it doesn't generate from normal chakra paths.

In comparison to the average shinobi, Sakura's taijutsu should still be superior (just look at her taijutsu battle against Shin Uchiha).\n\nThere's also the fact that Sakura stores chakra on her Hyakugou seal. If worst comes to worst she can release that stored chakra and there's nothing Hinata can do to stop it because it doesn't generate from normal chakra paths. It'll be like when Naruto beat Neji by using Kyuubi's chakra.",

As an antagonist add an immortal enemy that turns into black zetsu and had rinnegan or something. \n\nNgl, just thought that up, and it seems like a pretty interesting anime/story by itself.",

People here acting like Hinata has superior taijutsu even though Sakura was specifically trained in that aspect by Tsunade. In comparison to the average shinobi, Sakura's taijutsu should still be superior (just look at her taijutsu battle against Shin Uchiha).\n\nThere's also the fact that Sakura stores chakra on her Hyakugou seal. If worst comes to worst she can release that stored chakra and there's nothing Hinata can do to stop it because it doesn't generate from normal chakra paths. It'll be like when Naruto beat Neji by using Kyuubi's chakra.",

As an antagonist add an immortal enemy that turns into black zetsu and had rinnegan or something. \n\nNgl, just thought that up, and it seems like a pretty interesting anime/story by itself.",
