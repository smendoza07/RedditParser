Now then, Konan and Pain FOUNDED it (alongside Yahiko of course) Orochimaru was there to learn information about the Akatsuki, Obito and Zetsu were thee manipulation pain. Like I said about Kakuzu, he wanted money, and being in the Akatsuki allowed him to do that easily, without risk of being apprehended. Kisame (under the premise of Pain's plan of using the Bijuu) wanted to join because after questioning if his existence was \"nothing but a lie\" he wanted to create a world without lies. He was also one of Obitos most trusted comrades, which is evident in his unwavering loyalty, even to the end. For Hidan, his shtick was killing and giving the sacrifices to Jashin, and it also allowed him to escape ninjas after his head. Being in the Akatsuki, where that's basically all they do, would be very convienent to him. For Deidara, Itachi challenged him to a fight, and said if he lost, he had to join. Like Deidara, Sasori was challenged to a fight by Konan, and lost. Also, using the fact that Itachi went after Naruto is a really, really dumb argument, because if he didn't, the rest of the Akatsuki would know that he was spying for the leaf. Plus, that's literally what Pain ordered them to do. It's also very likely that at the time, all he really cared about was Sasuke's safety. For Juzo, I can't really answer that, mostly because he's in, like, two episodes, but I'd assume it would be for a reason like Hidan/Kakuzu.",

Now then, Konan and Pain FOUNDED it (alongside Yahiko of course) Orochimaru was there to learn information about the Akatsuki, Obito and Zetsu were thee manipulation pain. Like I said about Kakuzu, he wanted money, and being in the Akatsuki allowed him to do that easily, without risk of being apprehended. Kisame (under the premise of Pain's plan of using the Bijuu) wanted to join because after questioning if his existence was \"nothing but a lie\" he wanted to create a world without lies. He was also one of Obitos most trusted comrades, which is evident in his unwavering loyalty, even to the end. For Hidan, his shtick was killing and giving the sacrifices to Jashin, and it also allowed him to escape ninjas after his head. Being in the Akatsuki, where that's basically all they do, would be very convienent to him. For Deidara, Itachi challenged him to a fight, and said if he lost, he had to join. Like Deidara, Sasori was challenged to a fight by Konan, and lost. Also, using the fact that Itachi went after Naruto is a really, really dumb argument, because if he didn't, the rest of the Akatsuki would know that he was spying for the leaf. Plus, that's literally what Pain ordered them to do. It's also very likely that at the time, all he really cared about was Sasuke's safety. For Juzo, I can't really answer that, mostly because he's in, like, two episodes, but I'd assume it would be for a reason like Hidan/Kakuzu.",

Now then, Konan and Pain FOUNDED it (alongside Yahiko of course) Orochimaru was there to learn information about the Akatsuki, Obito and Zetsu were thee manipulation pain. Like I said about Kakuzu, he wanted money, and being in the Akatsuki allowed him to do that easily, without risk of being apprehended. Kisame (under the premise of Pain's plan of using the Bijuu) wanted to join because after questioning if his existence was \"nothing but a lie\" he wanted to create a world without lies. He was also one of Obitos most trusted comrades, which is evident in his unwavering loyalty, even to the end. For Hidan, his shtick was killing and giving the sacrifices to Jashin, and it also allowed him to escape ninjas after his head. Being in the Akatsuki, where that's basically all they do, would be very convienent to him. For Deidara, Itachi challenged him to a fight, and said if he lost, he had to join. Like Deidara, Sasori was challenged to a fight by Konan, and lost. Also, using the fact that Itachi went after Naruto is a really, really dumb argument, because if he didn't, the rest of the Akatsuki would know that he was spying for the leaf. Plus, that's literally what Pain ordered them to do. It's also very likely that at the time, all he really cared about was Sasuke's safety. For Juzo, I can't really answer that, mostly because he's in, like, two episodes, but I'd assume it would be for a reason like Hidan/Kakuzu.",

Now then, Konan and Pain FOUNDED it (alongside Yahiko of course) Orochimaru was there to learn information about the Akatsuki, Obito and Zetsu were thee manipulation pain. Like I said about Kakuzu, he wanted money, and being in the Akatsuki allowed him to do that easily, without risk of being apprehended. Kisame (under the premise of Pain's plan of using the Bijuu) wanted to join because after questioning if his existence was \"nothing but a lie\" he wanted to create a world without lies. He was also one of Obitos most trusted comrades, which is evident in his unwavering loyalty, even to the end. For Hidan, his shtick was killing and giving the sacrifices to Jashin, and it also allowed him to escape ninjas after his head. Being in the Akatsuki, where that's basically all they do, would be very convienent to him. For Deidara, Itachi challenged him to a fight, and said if he lost, he had to join. Like Deidara, Sasori was challenged to a fight by Konan, and lost. Also, using the fact that Itachi went after Naruto is a really, really dumb argument, because if he didn't, the rest of the Akatsuki would know that he was spying for the leaf. Plus, that's literally what Pain ordered them to do. It's also very likely that at the time, all he really cared about was Sasuke's safety. For Juzo, I can't really answer that, mostly because he's in, like, two episodes, but I'd assume it would be for a reason like Hidan/Kakuzu.",

Like I said about Kakuzu, he wanted money, and being in the Akatsuki allowed him to do that easily, without risk of being apprehended. Kisame (under the premise of Pain's plan of using the Bijuu) wanted to join because after questioning if his existence was \"nothing but a lie\" he wanted to create a world without lies. He was also one of Obitos most trusted comrades, which is evident in his unwavering loyalty, even to the end. For Hidan, his shtick was killing and giving the sacrifices to Jashin, and it also allowed him to escape ninjas after his head. Being in the Akatsuki, where that's basically all they do, would be very convienent to him. For Deidara, Itachi challenged him to a fight, and said if he lost, he had to join. Like Deidara, Sasori was challenged to a fight by Konan, and lost. Also, using the fact that Itachi went after Naruto is a really, really dumb argument, because if he didn't, the rest of the Akatsuki would know that he was spying for the leaf. Plus, that's literally what Pain ordered them to do. It's also very likely that at the time, all he really cared about was Sasuke's safety. For Juzo, I can't really answer that, mostly because he's in, like, two episodes, but I'd assume it would be for a reason like Hidan/Kakuzu.",
