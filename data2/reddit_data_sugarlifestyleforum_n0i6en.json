It's a bit too blunt especially when you're feeling each other out to figure out an arrangement. I prefer Support/Arrangement/Gifts/Pampering so it doesn't feel so transactional. Something like: \"I see. Should we discuss expectations for one another and the details of our arrangement?\" feels a lot classier while still having the same meaning. It also helps as not everyone may know what PPM means. For all we know he's an engineer and thinks it means \"Parts Per Million\".\n\nAs for pics, as a guy I wouldn't expect any nudes before actual intimacy. I understand there's plenty of flakes and creeps out there, and girls should protect themselves and their privacy. That being said, casual selfies in a cute outfit or workout clothes definitely helps reassure a guy your initial pics weren't heavily photoshopped/cropped/camera angle'd to be deceptive.",
