As I said, Tsukiyomi, he hit him dead on with Amaterasu.\n\nEdo Itachi is much stronger than living Itachi cause he doesn\u2019t have the stamina or chakra limitations normal Itachi does. Besides Edotachi\u2019s only feats was using Susano to block an attack that living Naruto and Bee just brushed off and then being support for Sasuke when they attacked Kabuto. He doesn\u2019t have that great of a showing. He\u2019s still slower, weaker and less Versatile than Sasuke.\n\nWe know this, because Sasuke immediately went off and gave a good fight against Bee and then managed to survive a 4v1 of the Kage and even managed to do some good damage before he unlocked Susano. The only difference between the Sasuke that killed Itachi and the Sasuke that killed Danzo was the Mangekyo techniques of which he only just unlocked. Had they both been going all out and Itachi whipped out Susano, Sasuke would\u2019ve summoned a Snake Boss to match it and people forget that at this time a significant portion of Sasuke\u2019s concentration and strength was being spent on suppressing Orochimaru.",

Itachi could blitz Sasuke if he wanted tp and there's nothing Sasuke could do about it.\nI do need to remind you that Sasuke almost died twice against Bee, and he had to be saved by Karin and Jugo,right ?\nHe was also saved twice during the Kage Summit, once by Tobi and the other by Zetsu. \nGaining the MS or the EMS for that matter does make you stronger, it's not like it just gives you bonus techniques.\nIf Itachi could easily defeat Orochimaru's strongest form you really think he would struggle against a snake summon? He'd just use Amaterasu once or Totsuka Seal it.\nPlus, only a small part of Sasuke's chakra was used to suppress Orochimaru, not his strength.\nAside from that, Sasuke greatly benefited from absorbing Orochimaru since he got a plethora of nee abilities like enhanced healing and snake techniques.\nI am a Sasuke fanboy as well but to claim that Hebi Sasuke could defeat Itachi is like claiming base Madara can beat Kaguya.",

The Naruto fandom is a collective of fucktards. They genuinely believe that Itachi knew that Sasuke was suppressing Orochimaru when he flat out didn\u2019t, showing that in the fight and even admitting it when Edo Tensei\u2019d. They believe that Tobirama oppressed the Uchiha based on the words of Orochimaru. There are still people who believe that Naruto won the Pain fight on luck when it was Naruto curbstomping Pain before he got one lucky hit in for the pin. There are people who don\u2019t believe that Naruto was significantly injured during his first Shippuden encounter with Sasuke even though literally 4 pages before he was outright collapsing and screaming in pain. Hell, there are still people who believe that the village didn\u2019t change their mind about Naruto until after the Pain fight.\n\nAnd I didn\u2019t say Sasuke was outright stronger at that point. I said that he had prepared enough that he was able to beat everything Itachi threw at him and that Itachi threw literally everything in his arsenal at him. Name one technique that Itachi could use that would\u2019ve worked besides Izanagi. Susano\u2019o was too taxing as per his own admission and is what did him in in the end. Izanami wouldn\u2019t have worked because Sasuke knew exactly who he was and what his goal was. If he\u2019d kept Kotoamatsukami then he could\u2019ve use that, but he\u2019d given it to Naruto for a contingency",

He was literally busting out all the stops before Sasuke was exhausted enough to accidentally release Orochimaru. \n\nItachi threw a full-strength Tsukiyomi at Sasuke and not only lost, but had it completely turned on him. We know it was full strength because he used it full against both Kakashi and Sasuke in P1 and Sasuke made no mention of it being any weaker.\n\nItachi used all the strength he had left and still would\u2019ve lost regardless. Name a single technique he could\u2019ve used to end the fight quicker. Couldn\u2019t be Tsukiyomi, he lost that fight. Can\u2019t be Amaterasu, he used it and failed and he can\u2019t just pile it on, even in P1 when he was relatively healthy he could only use it a few times a day when fully rested according to Kisame. Can\u2019t be Izanami, it wouldn\u2019t work on Sasuke. He knows his identity and goal. He can\u2019t use Susano\u2019o freely. Zetsu outright states it\u2019s a big risk for Itachi to use at the best of times due to the strain it puts on the body as even Sasuke was collapsing under the damage it does at the Summit arc and he\u2019s far more healthy than Itachi ever was. His only option is Izanagi and that just gives him a get out of jail free card. He had no other technique with the firepower to put Sasuke down.\n\nWhile Itachi was trying and failing to draw out the fight, it wasn\u2019t to get rid of Orochimaru. As I said, he didn\u2019t know he was there. It was to last long enough that Naruto could get Sasuke after the fight, hence his \u201cSasuke will be dyed any colour\u201d speech. That\u2019s what I believe is the most likely answer. Sasuke won by forcing him to go Susano\u2019o and die too early. Sasuke legitimately would\u2019ve won that fight if Itachi was fighting with the intent to kill him and survive doing so. He can\u2019t just bust Susano\u2019o out as he said as an Edo.

As I said, Tsukiyomi, he hit him dead on with Amaterasu.\n\nEdo Itachi is much stronger than living Itachi cause he doesn\u2019t have the stamina or chakra limitations normal Itachi does. Besides Edotachi\u2019s only feats was using Susano to block an attack that living Naruto and Bee just brushed off and then being support for Sasuke when they attacked Kabuto. He doesn\u2019t have that great of a showing. He\u2019s still slower, weaker and less Versatile than Sasuke.\n\nWe know this, because Sasuke immediately went off and gave a good fight against Bee and then managed to survive a 4v1 of the Kage and even managed to do some good damage before he unlocked Susano. The only difference between the Sasuke that killed Itachi and the Sasuke that killed Danzo was the Mangekyo techniques of which he only just unlocked. Had they both been going all out and Itachi whipped out Susano, Sasuke would\u2019ve summoned a Snake Boss to match it and people forget that at this time a significant portion of Sasuke\u2019s concentration and strength was being spent on suppressing Orochimaru.",

He knew after their battle sasuke would win and he kept precautions too, like planting an amerterasu in sasuke's eyes, giving shisui's genjutsu to naruto etc.Itachi was suprised that sasuke survived his tsukiyomi because he still thought sasuke was the same child that he knocked with taijutsu before . the reason he let sasuke win is because he loved him",

Susano\u2019o was causing the healthy Sasuke and Kakashi unbearable pain and even Madara commented that it dangerous to use because it causes immense stress on the body.\n\nItachi didn\u2019t even know that Orochimaru was in Sasuke\u2019s body. He was actually surprised when Orochimaru busted out, and btw suppressing Orochimaru was taking a good amount of Sasuke\u2019s concentration and chakra so for most of the fight Sasuke wasn\u2019t at 100%.\n\nItachi literally can\u2019t use Yasaka beads. It and Susano\u2019o take too much chakra that he doesn\u2019t have unless in Edo mode which he specifically states when fighting Nagato. And I didn\u2019t say he wanted to kill Sasuke. I said he didn\u2019t let him win. There\u2019s a difference.",

Itachi could blitz Sasuke if he wanted tp and there's nothing Sasuke could do about it.\nI do need to remind you that Sasuke almost died twice against Bee, and he had to be saved by Karin and Jugo,right ?\nHe was also saved twice during the Kage Summit, once by Tobi and the other by Zetsu. \nGaining the MS or the EMS for that matter does make you stronger, it's not like it just gives you bonus techniques.\nIf Itachi could easily defeat Orochimaru's strongest form you really think he would struggle against a snake summon? He'd just use Amaterasu once or Totsuka Seal it.\nPlus, only a small part of Sasuke's chakra was used to suppress Orochimaru, not his strength.\nAside from that, Sasuke greatly benefited from absorbing Orochimaru since he got a plethora of nee abilities like enhanced healing and snake techniques.\nI am a Sasuke fanboy as well but to claim that Hebi Sasuke could defeat Itachi is like claiming base Madara can beat Kaguya.",

The Naruto fandom is a collective of fucktards. They genuinely believe that Itachi knew that Sasuke was suppressing Orochimaru when he flat out didn\u2019t, showing that in the fight and even admitting it when Edo Tensei\u2019d. They believe that Tobirama oppressed the Uchiha based on the words of Orochimaru. There are still people who believe that Naruto won the Pain fight on luck when it was Naruto curbstomping Pain before he got one lucky hit in for the pin. There are people who don\u2019t believe that Naruto was significantly injured during his first Shippuden encounter with Sasuke even though literally 4 pages before he was outright collapsing and screaming in pain. Hell, there are still people who believe that the village didn\u2019t change their mind about Naruto until after the Pain fight.\n\nAnd I didn\u2019t say Sasuke was outright stronger at that point. I said that he had prepared enough that he was able to beat everything Itachi threw at him and that Itachi threw literally everything in his arsenal at him. Name one technique that Itachi could use that would\u2019ve worked besides Izanagi. Susano\u2019o was too taxing as per his own admission and is what did him in in the end. Izanami wouldn\u2019t have worked because Sasuke knew exactly who he was and what his goal was. If he\u2019d kept Kotoamatsukami then he could\u2019ve use that, but he\u2019d given it to Naruto for a contingency",

Name a single technique he could\u2019ve used to end the fight quicker. Couldn\u2019t be Tsukiyomi, he lost that fight. Can\u2019t be Amaterasu, he used it and failed and he can\u2019t just pile it on, even in P1 when he was relatively healthy he could only use it a few times a day when fully rested according to Kisame. Can\u2019t be Izanami, it wouldn\u2019t work on Sasuke. He knows his identity and goal. He can\u2019t use Susano\u2019o freely. Zetsu outright states it\u2019s a big risk for Itachi to use at the best of times due to the strain it puts on the body as even Sasuke was collapsing under the damage it does at the Summit arc and he\u2019s far more healthy than Itachi ever was. His only option is Izanagi and that just gives him a get out of jail free card. He had no other technique with the firepower to put Sasuke down.\n\nWhile Itachi was trying and failing to draw out the fight, it wasn\u2019t to get rid of Orochimaru. As I said, he didn\u2019t know he was there. It was to last long enough that Naruto could get Sasuke after the fight, hence his \u201cSasuke will be dyed any colour\u201d speech. That\u2019s what I believe is the most likely answer. Sasuke won by forcing him to go Susano\u2019o and die too early. Sasuke legitimately would\u2019ve won that fight if Itachi was fighting with the intent to kill him and survive doing so. He can\u2019t just bust Susano\u2019o out as he said as an Edo.

He has his own reasons for doing so, namely that convincing Sasuke he was weaker than Itachi would mean that Sasuke wouldn\u2019t turn against him because he believed Tobi to be stronger than Itachi.\n\nA>B doesn\u2019t mean B>C. That\u2019s always been part of the Naruto fight scaling.\n\nItachi beat Orochimaru with a Genjutsu, probably Tsukiyomi considering Orochimaru\u2019s knowledge of the Mangekyo and it\u2019s connection to the Rinnegan. Considering that Tsunade has feats that show her stomping in Itachi such as shattering Madara\u2019s Susano\u2019o and even literally putting herself back together after being bisected even managing to hold pace with A and Naruto in KCMV1, and Orochimaru was capable of beating her before he got his arms sealed, it\u2019s really not as clear cut Itachi>Orochimaru as people think. Hell, Kakashi was in a coma after Tsukiyomi and Orochimaru was still in a condition to run away, which gives a good argument that Orochimaru would\u2019ve had a good shot if he hadn\u2019t been caught in Tsukiyomi. I say it had to be Tsukiyomi, since Orochimaru has a high Genjutsu stat and could\u2019ve broken any other Genjutsu, since even Naruto gives Itachi\u2019s non-Sharingan Genjutsu a good fight and he\u2019s shit tier at Genjutsu.\n\nHell, any of the Sannin could\u2019ve taken Itachi if they could avoid his Genjutsu. Genjutsu is Itachi\u2019s go to for a reason. It\u2019s his way of making up for his shit-tier physical stats. It\u2019s why I truly believe that when Sasuke was able to reverse Itachi\u2019s Genjutsu back on him, he was in the position to win.",

Tobi is Itachi's accomplice in the Uchiha massacre. Tobi knows the truth that Itachi didn't want Sasuke to learn, that Itachi was never the villain Sasuke thought he was and that Itachi eliminated his clan for Konoha's sake and to spare Sasuke's life. Itachi wanted Sasuke to believe that Itachi was a villain trying to kill Sasuke to take his eyes in an attempt for more power which wasn't true. [Itachi wanted Sasuke to kill him and admits to this as an edo tensei](https://s1.mangabeast01.com/manga/Naruto/0576-017.png). Tobi exposed Itachi's lie which Itachi implanted amaterasu in Sasuke to prevent. What Tobi said was the truth.\n\n>Itachi, as my link showed, did. Not. Know.\n\nIn the link I showed, Itachi says \"So you finally show yourself\". He was waiting for Orochimaru and swiftly deals with him.\n\n>He has his own reasons for doing so, namely that convincing Sasuke he was weaker than Itachi would mean that Sasuke wouldn\u2019t turn against him because he believed Tobi to be stronger than Itachi.\n\n[Itachi admits to Sasuke that his plan was for Sasuke to judge him.](https://s1.mangabeast01.com/manga/Naruto/0576-017.png) He wanted Sasuke to win and threw the fight.\n\n>Itachi beat Orochimaru with a Genjutsu, probably Tsukiyomi\n\n[Itachi](https://s1.mangabeast01.com/manga/Naruto/0345-008.png) [used regular](https://s1.mangabeast01.com/manga/Naruto/0345-009.png) [3 tomoe sharingan genjutsu](https://s1.mangabeast01.com/manga/Naruto/0345-010.png).\n\n>Considering that Tsunade has feats that show her stomping in Itachi such as shattering Madara\u2019s Susano\u2019o \n\nTsunade broke the lowest form of Susanoo, the rib cage. She can't contend with regular susanoo. Neither can Orochimaru as we see that he doesn't last even one second.\n\n>ell, Kakashi was in a coma after Tsukiyomi and Orochimaru was still in a condition to run away, which gives a good argument that Orochimaru would\u2019ve had a good shot if he hadn\u2019t been caught in Tsukiyomi.\n\nI already proved you have no clue what you're talking about. Orochimaru was hit with regular sharingan genjutsu.\n\n>I say it had to be Tsukiyomi, since Orochimaru has a high Genjutsu stat and could\u2019ve broken any other Genjutsu, since even Naruto gives Itachi\u2019s non-Sharingan Genjutsu a good fight and he\u2019s shit tier at Genjutsu.\n\n\"You say its...\". So you're basically admitting that the truth doesn't matter to you. You just declare incorrect shit to be true because you said so.\n\nYou're deluded. It's clear now. Even Sasuke had an easier time accepting the truth than you.",

But that's not a fair argument. Aside from that yeah, Itachi could've won but he certainly didn't \"let Sasuke win\".

As I said, Tsukiyomi, he hit him dead on with Amaterasu.\n\nEdo Itachi is much stronger than living Itachi cause he doesn\u2019t have the stamina or chakra limitations normal Itachi does. Besides Edotachi\u2019s only feats was using Susano to block an attack that living Naruto and Bee just brushed off and then being support for Sasuke when they attacked Kabuto. He doesn\u2019t have that great of a showing. He\u2019s still slower, weaker and less Versatile than Sasuke.\n\nWe know this, because Sasuke immediately went off and gave a good fight against Bee and then managed to survive a 4v1 of the Kage and even managed to do some good damage before he unlocked Susano. The only difference between the Sasuke that killed Itachi and the Sasuke that killed Danzo was the Mangekyo techniques of which he only just unlocked. Had they both been going all out and Itachi whipped out Susano, Sasuke would\u2019ve summoned a Snake Boss to match it and people forget that at this time a significant portion of Sasuke\u2019s concentration and strength was being spent on suppressing Orochimaru.",

He knew after their battle sasuke would win and he kept precautions too, like planting an amerterasu in sasuke's eyes, giving shisui's genjutsu to naruto etc.Itachi was suprised that sasuke survived his tsukiyomi because he still thought sasuke was the same child that he knocked with taijutsu before . the reason he let sasuke win is because he loved him",

Itachi could blitz Sasuke if he wanted tp and there's nothing Sasuke could do about it.\nI do need to remind you that Sasuke almost died twice against Bee, and he had to be saved by Karin and Jugo,right ?\nHe was also saved twice during the Kage Summit, once by Tobi and the other by Zetsu. \nGaining the MS or the EMS for that matter does make you stronger, it's not like it just gives you bonus techniques.\nIf Itachi could easily defeat Orochimaru's strongest form you really think he would struggle against a snake summon? He'd just use Amaterasu once or Totsuka Seal it.\nPlus, only a small part of Sasuke's chakra was used to suppress Orochimaru, not his strength.\nAside from that, Sasuke greatly benefited from absorbing Orochimaru since he got a plethora of nee abilities like enhanced healing and snake techniques.\nI am a Sasuke fanboy as well but to claim that Hebi Sasuke could defeat Itachi is like claiming base Madara can beat Kaguya.",

They genuinely believe that Itachi knew that Sasuke was suppressing Orochimaru when he flat out didn\u2019t, showing that in the fight and even admitting it when Edo Tensei\u2019d. They believe that Tobirama oppressed the Uchiha based on the words of Orochimaru. There are still people who believe that Naruto won the Pain fight on luck when it was Naruto curbstomping Pain before he got one lucky hit in for the pin. There are people who don\u2019t believe that Naruto was significantly injured during his first Shippuden encounter with Sasuke even though literally 4 pages before he was outright collapsing and screaming in pain. Hell, there are still people who believe that the village didn\u2019t change their mind about Naruto until after the Pain fight.\n\nAnd I didn\u2019t say Sasuke was outright stronger at that point. I said that he had prepared enough that he was able to beat everything Itachi threw at him and that Itachi threw literally everything in his arsenal at him. Name one technique that Itachi could use that would\u2019ve worked besides Izanagi. Susano\u2019o was too taxing as per his own admission and is what did him in in the end. Izanami wouldn\u2019t have worked because Sasuke knew exactly who he was and what his goal was.

He was literally busting out all the stops before Sasuke was exhausted enough to accidentally release Orochimaru. \n\nItachi threw a full-strength Tsukiyomi at Sasuke and not only lost, but had it completely turned on him. We know it was full strength because he used it full against both Kakashi and Sasuke in P1 and Sasuke made no mention of it being any weaker.\n\nItachi used all the strength he had left and still would\u2019ve lost regardless. Name a single technique he could\u2019ve used to end the fight quicker. Couldn\u2019t be Tsukiyomi, he lost that fight. Can\u2019t be Amaterasu, he used it and failed and he can\u2019t just pile it on, even in P1 when he was relatively healthy he could only use it a few times a day when fully rested according to Kisame. Can\u2019t be Izanami, it wouldn\u2019t work on Sasuke. He knows his identity and goal. He can\u2019t use Susano\u2019o freely. Zetsu outright states it\u2019s a big risk for Itachi to use at the best of times due to the strain it puts on the body as even Sasuke was collapsing under the damage it does at the Summit arc and he\u2019s far more healthy than Itachi ever was. His only option is Izanagi and that just gives him a get out of jail free card. He had no other technique with the firepower to put Sasuke down.\n\nWhile Itachi was trying and failing to draw out the fight, it wasn\u2019t to get rid of Orochimaru. As I said, he didn\u2019t know he was there. It was to last long enough that Naruto could get Sasuke after the fight, hence his \u201cSasuke will be dyed any colour\u201d speech. That\u2019s what I believe is the most likely answer. Sasuke won by forcing him to go Susano\u2019o and die too early. Sasuke legitimately would\u2019ve won that fight if Itachi was fighting with the intent to kill him and survive doing so. He can\u2019t just bust Susano\u2019o out as he said as an Edo.

Hell, Kakashi was in a coma after Tsukiyomi and Orochimaru was still in a condition to run away, which gives a good argument that Orochimaru would\u2019ve had a good shot if he hadn\u2019t been caught in Tsukiyomi.

The dude didn't even use yasika beads and he only used his blade to seal orochimaru . also why did he give shisui's eye to naruto before he went to battle , if he wanted to kill him and was so sure of it why would he want naruto to take the eye , he could habe used it against sasuke in the battle and killed him there.Itachi never meant to win the battle against sasuke . He knew after their battle sasuke would win and he kept precautions too, like planting an amerterasu in sasuke's eyes, giving shisui's genjutsu to naruto etc.Itachi was suprised that sasuke survived his tsukiyomi because he still thought sasuke was the same child that he knocked with taijutsu before . the reason he let sasuke win is because he loved him",

He was actually surprised when Orochimaru busted out, and btw suppressing Orochimaru was taking a good amount of Sasuke\u2019s concentration and chakra so for most of the fight Sasuke wasn\u2019t at 100%.\n\nItachi literally can\u2019t use Yasaka beads.

Itachi could blitz Sasuke if he wanted tp and there's nothing Sasuke could do about it.\nI do need to remind you that Sasuke almost died twice against Bee, and he had to be saved by Karin and Jugo,right ?\nHe was also saved twice during the Kage Summit, once by Tobi and the other by Zetsu. \nGaining the MS or the EMS for that matter does make you stronger, it's not like it just gives you bonus techniques.\nIf Itachi could easily defeat Orochimaru's strongest form you really think he would struggle against a snake summon? He'd just use Amaterasu once or Totsuka Seal it.\nPlus, only a small part of Sasuke's chakra was used to suppress Orochimaru, not his strength.\nAside from that, Sasuke greatly benefited from absorbing Orochimaru since he got a plethora of nee abilities like enhanced healing and snake techniques.\nI am a Sasuke fanboy as well but to claim that Hebi Sasuke could defeat Itachi is like claiming base Madara can beat Kaguya.",

They genuinely believe that Itachi knew that Sasuke was suppressing Orochimaru when he flat out didn\u2019t, showing that in the fight and even admitting it when Edo Tensei\u2019d. They believe that Tobirama oppressed the Uchiha based on the words of Orochimaru. There are still people who believe that Naruto won the Pain fight on luck when it was Naruto curbstomping Pain before he got one lucky hit in for the pin. There are people who don\u2019t believe that Naruto was significantly injured during his first Shippuden encounter with Sasuke even though literally 4 pages before he was outright collapsing and screaming in pain. Hell, there are still people who believe that the village didn\u2019t change their mind about Naruto until after the Pain fight.\n\nAnd I didn\u2019t say Sasuke was outright stronger at that point. I said that he had prepared enough that he was able to beat everything Itachi threw at him and that Itachi threw literally everything in his arsenal at him. Name one technique that Itachi could use that would\u2019ve worked besides Izanagi. Susano\u2019o was too taxing as per his own admission and is what did him in in the end. Izanami wouldn\u2019t have worked because Sasuke knew exactly who he was and what his goal was. If he\u2019d kept Kotoamatsukami then he could\u2019ve use that, but he\u2019d given it to Naruto for a contingency",

The dude didn't even use yasika beads and he only used his blade to seal orochimaru . also why did he give shisui's eye to naruto before he went to battle , if he wanted to kill him and was so sure of it why would he want naruto to take the eye , he could habe used it against sasuke in the battle and killed him there.Itachi never meant to win the battle against sasuke . He knew after their battle sasuke would win and he kept precautions too, like planting an amerterasu in sasuke's eyes, giving shisui's genjutsu to naruto etc.Itachi was suprised that sasuke survived his tsukiyomi because he still thought sasuke was the same child that he knocked with taijutsu before . the reason he let sasuke win is because he loved him",

He was actually surprised when Orochimaru busted out, and btw suppressing Orochimaru was taking a good amount of Sasuke\u2019s concentration and chakra so for most of the fight Sasuke wasn\u2019t at 100%.\n\nItachi literally can\u2019t use Yasaka beads. It and Susano\u2019o take too much chakra that he doesn\u2019t have unless in Edo mode which he specifically states when fighting Nagato. And I didn\u2019t say he wanted to kill Sasuke.

They genuinely believe that Itachi knew that Sasuke was suppressing Orochimaru when he flat out didn\u2019t, showing that in the fight and even admitting it when Edo Tensei\u2019d. They believe that Tobirama oppressed the Uchiha based on the words of Orochimaru. There are still people who believe that Naruto won the Pain fight on luck when it was Naruto curbstomping Pain before he got one lucky hit in for the pin. There are people who don\u2019t believe that Naruto was significantly injured during his first Shippuden encounter with Sasuke even though literally 4 pages before he was outright collapsing and screaming in pain. Hell, there are still people who believe that the village didn\u2019t change their mind about Naruto until after the Pain fight.\n\nAnd I didn\u2019t say Sasuke was outright stronger at that point. I said that he had prepared enough that he was able to beat everything Itachi threw at him and that Itachi threw literally everything in his arsenal at him. Name one technique that Itachi could use that would\u2019ve worked besides Izanagi. Susano\u2019o was too taxing as per his own admission and is what did him in in the end. Izanami wouldn\u2019t have worked because Sasuke knew exactly who he was and what his goal was. If he\u2019d kept Kotoamatsukami then he could\u2019ve use that, but he\u2019d given it to Naruto for a contingency",

That\u2019s always been part of the Naruto fight scaling.\n\nItachi beat Orochimaru with a Genjutsu, probably Tsukiyomi considering Orochimaru\u2019s knowledge of the Mangekyo and it\u2019s connection to the Rinnegan. Considering that Tsunade has feats that show her stomping in Itachi such as shattering Madara\u2019s Susano\u2019o and even literally putting herself back together after being bisected even managing to hold pace with A and Naruto in KCMV1, and Orochimaru was capable of beating her before he got his arms sealed, it\u2019s really not as clear cut Itachi>Orochimaru as people think. Hell, Kakashi was in a coma after Tsukiyomi and Orochimaru was still in a condition to run away, which gives a good argument that Orochimaru would\u2019ve had a good shot if he hadn\u2019t been caught in Tsukiyomi. I say it had to be Tsukiyomi, since Orochimaru has a high Genjutsu stat and could\u2019ve broken any other Genjutsu, since even Naruto gives Itachi\u2019s non-Sharingan Genjutsu a good fight and he\u2019s shit tier at Genjutsu.\n\nHell, any of the Sannin could\u2019ve taken Itachi if they could avoid his Genjutsu. Genjutsu is Itachi\u2019s go to for a reason. It\u2019s his way of making up for his shit-tier physical stats. It\u2019s why I truly believe that when Sasuke was able to reverse Itachi\u2019s Genjutsu back on him, he was in the position to win.",

Tobi is Itachi's accomplice in the Uchiha massacre. Tobi knows the truth that Itachi didn't want Sasuke to learn, that Itachi was never the villain Sasuke thought he was and that Itachi eliminated his clan for Konoha's sake and to spare Sasuke's life. Itachi wanted Sasuke to believe that Itachi was a villain trying to kill Sasuke to take his eyes in an attempt for more power which wasn't true. [Itachi wanted Sasuke to kill him and admits to this as an edo tensei](https://s1.mangabeast01.com/manga/Naruto/0576-017.png). Tobi exposed Itachi's lie which Itachi implanted amaterasu in Sasuke to prevent. What Tobi said was the truth.\n\n>Itachi, as my link showed, did. Not. Know.\n\nIn the link I showed, Itachi says \"So you finally show yourself\". He was waiting for Orochimaru and swiftly deals with him.\n\n>He has his own reasons for doing so, namely that convincing Sasuke he was weaker than Itachi would mean that Sasuke wouldn\u2019t turn against him because he believed Tobi to be stronger than Itachi.\n\n[Itachi admits to Sasuke that his plan was for Sasuke to judge him.](https://s1.mangabeast01.com/manga/Naruto/0576-017.png) He wanted Sasuke to win and threw the fight.\n\n>Itachi beat Orochimaru with a Genjutsu, probably Tsukiyomi\n\n[Itachi](https://s1.mangabeast01.com/manga/Naruto/0345-008.png) [used regular](https://s1.mangabeast01.com/manga/Naruto/0345-009.png) [3 tomoe sharingan genjutsu](https://s1.mangabeast01.com/manga/Naruto/0345-010.png).\n\n>Considering that Tsunade has feats that show her stomping in Itachi such as shattering Madara\u2019s Susano\u2019o \n\nTsunade broke the lowest form of Susanoo, the rib cage. She can't contend with regular susanoo. Neither can Orochimaru as we see that he doesn't last even one second.\n\n>ell, Kakashi was in a coma after Tsukiyomi and Orochimaru was still in a condition to run away, which gives a good argument that Orochimaru would\u2019ve had a good shot if he hadn\u2019t been caught in Tsukiyomi.\n\nI already proved you have no clue what you're talking about. Orochimaru was hit with regular sharingan genjutsu.\n\n>I say it had to be Tsukiyomi, since Orochimaru has a high Genjutsu stat and could\u2019ve broken any other Genjutsu, since even Naruto gives Itachi\u2019s non-Sharingan Genjutsu a good fight and he\u2019s shit tier at Genjutsu.\n\n\"You say its...\". So you're basically admitting that the truth doesn't matter to you. You just declare incorrect shit to be true because you said so.\n\nYou're deluded. It's clear now.

They genuinely believe that Itachi knew that Sasuke was suppressing Orochimaru when he flat out didn\u2019t, showing that in the fight and even admitting it when Edo Tensei\u2019d. They believe that Tobirama oppressed the Uchiha based on the words of Orochimaru. There are still people who believe that Naruto won the Pain fight on luck when it was Naruto curbstomping Pain before he got one lucky hit in for the pin. There are people who don\u2019t believe that Naruto was significantly injured during his first Shippuden encounter with Sasuke even though literally 4 pages before he was outright collapsing and screaming in pain. Hell, there are still people who believe that the village didn\u2019t change their mind about Naruto until after the Pain fight.\n\nAnd I didn\u2019t say Sasuke was outright stronger at that point. I said that he had prepared enough that he was able to beat everything Itachi threw at him and that Itachi threw literally everything in his arsenal at him. Name one technique that Itachi could use that would\u2019ve worked besides Izanagi. Susano\u2019o was too taxing as per his own admission and is what did him in in the end. Izanami wouldn\u2019t have worked because Sasuke knew exactly who he was and what his goal was. If he\u2019d kept Kotoamatsukami then he could\u2019ve use that, but he\u2019d given it to Naruto for a contingency",

Tobi is Itachi's accomplice in the Uchiha massacre. Tobi knows the truth that Itachi didn't want Sasuke to learn, that Itachi was never the villain Sasuke thought he was and that Itachi eliminated his clan for Konoha's sake and to spare Sasuke's life. Itachi wanted Sasuke to believe that Itachi was a villain trying to kill Sasuke to take his eyes in an attempt for more power which wasn't true. [Itachi wanted Sasuke to kill him and admits to this as an edo tensei](https://s1.mangabeast01.com/manga/Naruto/0576-017.png). Tobi exposed Itachi's lie which Itachi implanted amaterasu in Sasuke to prevent. What Tobi said was the truth.\n\n>Itachi, as my link showed, did. Not.

He was waiting for Orochimaru and swiftly deals with him.\n\n>He has his own reasons for doing so, namely that convincing Sasuke he was weaker than Itachi would mean that Sasuke wouldn\u2019t turn against him because he believed Tobi to be stronger than Itachi.\n\n[Itachi admits to Sasuke that his plan was for Sasuke to judge him.](https://s1.mangabeast01.com/manga/Naruto/0576-017.png) He wanted Sasuke to win and threw the fight.\n\n>Itachi beat Orochimaru with a Genjutsu, probably Tsukiyomi\n\n[Itachi](https://s1.mangabeast01.com/manga/Naruto/0345-008.png) [used regular](https://s1.mangabeast01.com/manga/Naruto/0345-009.png) [3 tomoe sharingan genjutsu](https://s1.mangabeast01.com/manga/Naruto/0345-010.png).\n\n>Considering that Tsunade has feats that show her stomping in Itachi such as shattering Madara\u2019s Susano\u2019o \n\nTsunade broke the lowest form of Susanoo, the rib cage. She can't contend with regular susanoo. Neither can Orochimaru as we see that he doesn't last even one second.\n\n>ell, Kakashi was in a coma after Tsukiyomi and Orochimaru was still in a condition to run away, which gives a good argument that Orochimaru would\u2019ve had a good shot if he hadn\u2019t been caught in Tsukiyomi.\n\nI already proved you have no clue what you're talking about. Orochimaru was hit with regular sharingan genjutsu.\n\n>I say it had to be Tsukiyomi, since Orochimaru has a high Genjutsu stat and could\u2019ve broken any other Genjutsu, since even Naruto gives Itachi\u2019s non-Sharingan Genjutsu a good fight and he\u2019s shit tier at Genjutsu.\n\n\"You say its...\". So you're basically admitting that the truth doesn't matter to you. You just declare incorrect shit to be true because you said so.\n\nYou're deluded. It's clear now. Even Sasuke had an easier time accepting the truth than you.",

They genuinely believe that Itachi knew that Sasuke was suppressing Orochimaru when he flat out didn\u2019t, showing that in the fight and even admitting it when Edo Tensei\u2019d. They believe that Tobirama oppressed the Uchiha based on the words of Orochimaru. There are still people who believe that Naruto won the Pain fight on luck when it was Naruto curbstomping Pain before he got one lucky hit in for the pin. There are people who don\u2019t believe that Naruto was significantly injured during his first Shippuden encounter with Sasuke even though literally 4 pages before he was outright collapsing and screaming in pain. Hell, there are still people who believe that the village didn\u2019t change their mind about Naruto until after the Pain fight.\n\nAnd I didn\u2019t say Sasuke was outright stronger at that point. I said that he had prepared enough that he was able to beat everything Itachi threw at him and that Itachi threw literally everything in his arsenal at him. Name one technique that Itachi could use that would\u2019ve worked besides Izanagi. Susano\u2019o was too taxing as per his own admission and is what did him in in the end. Izanami wouldn\u2019t have worked because Sasuke knew exactly who he was and what his goal was. If he\u2019d kept Kotoamatsukami then he could\u2019ve use that, but he\u2019d given it to Naruto for a contingency",

They genuinely believe that Itachi knew that Sasuke was suppressing Orochimaru when he flat out didn\u2019t, showing that in the fight and even admitting it when Edo Tensei\u2019d. They believe that Tobirama oppressed the Uchiha based on the words of Orochimaru. There are still people who believe that Naruto won the Pain fight on luck when it was Naruto curbstomping Pain before he got one lucky hit in for the pin. There are people who don\u2019t believe that Naruto was significantly injured during his first Shippuden encounter with Sasuke even though literally 4 pages before he was outright collapsing and screaming in pain. Hell, there are still people who believe that the village didn\u2019t change their mind about Naruto until after the Pain fight.\n\nAnd I didn\u2019t say Sasuke was outright stronger at that point. I said that he had prepared enough that he was able to beat everything Itachi threw at him and that Itachi threw literally everything in his arsenal at him. Name one technique that Itachi could use that would\u2019ve worked besides Izanagi. Susano\u2019o was too taxing as per his own admission and is what did him in in the end. Izanami wouldn\u2019t have worked because Sasuke knew exactly who he was and what his goal was. If he\u2019d kept Kotoamatsukami then he could\u2019ve use that, but he\u2019d given it to Naruto for a contingency",

They genuinely believe that Itachi knew that Sasuke was suppressing Orochimaru when he flat out didn\u2019t, showing that in the fight and even admitting it when Edo Tensei\u2019d. They believe that Tobirama oppressed the Uchiha based on the words of Orochimaru. There are still people who believe that Naruto won the Pain fight on luck when it was Naruto curbstomping Pain before he got one lucky hit in for the pin. There are people who don\u2019t believe that Naruto was significantly injured during his first Shippuden encounter with Sasuke even though literally 4 pages before he was outright collapsing and screaming in pain. Hell, there are still people who believe that the village didn\u2019t change their mind about Naruto until after the Pain fight.\n\nAnd I didn\u2019t say Sasuke was outright stronger at that point. I said that he had prepared enough that he was able to beat everything Itachi threw at him and that Itachi threw literally everything in his arsenal at him. Name one technique that Itachi could use that would\u2019ve worked besides Izanagi. Susano\u2019o was too taxing as per his own admission and is what did him in in the end. Izanami wouldn\u2019t have worked because Sasuke knew exactly who he was and what his goal was. If he\u2019d kept Kotoamatsukami then he could\u2019ve use that, but he\u2019d given it to Naruto for a contingency",
