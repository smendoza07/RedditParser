But the idea that you were talking about was in of itself kinda toxic. Now I wouldn't say that's youre fault but if you choose to learn and develop your ideas, or keep your closed minded mindset Is up to you. I would suggest seeking out therapy  because a random stranger on reddit can't help with you're trauma that much. Good luck :)",
