The whole \"biological vs being there\" schtick that they tried to pull during her gaiden, would have worked wonders.

But he had a moment when he was fighting Killer B where he thought of Sakura and Naruto, before he defended his new team. I think that moment shows that despite how much Sasuke pushed them away, they still occupied a part of his mind because they were the first friends he ever had.   \n\n3) he realizes bonds/love are what made Naruto so strong, and he reverts to his old self after the final fight. He confesses his feelings for Naruto (no homo).\n\nThe reason Naruto and Sakura can forgive Sasuke so easily is because in their eyes, they don't see \"evil Sasuke\" as the real one. \n\nIt still sucks though.",

Every time Naruto tells him \"I see you like a brother/friend\" he goes into killer mode. \n\nFor example, during the 5-kage summit arc, when Naruto confronted Sasuke and gave him his whole \"you are my friend\" speech, Sasuke got very pissed off and goes into \"I have to kill Naruto\" mode. \n\nDuring their very first fight (Valley of the End) when Naruto was telling Sasuke how he sees him like his brother, Sasuke actually looked guilty - and then he went into the \"I have to kill Naruto\" mode. \n\nIn their final fight, he calls Naruto his \"one and only friend\" and is VERY pissed off that he is still unable to get rid of this attachment.",

For like my entire childhood until my 20s pretty much I was mentally ill and pushed everyone I cared about away, I was self destructive, nihilist, traumatized, etc. And I'd given up on myself just like Sasuke had towards the end of the war. It was only thanks to my loved one's persistence that I came around. So like, yeah Sasuke is not a typical character to come to mind in terms of \"wow so relatable\" but at a base level and without all the theatrics and ninja shit I think there are some themes that could resonate with a lot of people. \n\nTrauma changes you and makes you say and do things that are irrational and out of character. Not an excuse for tryna kill your friends, but yeah. Sasuke wasn't evil, he was just lost and traumatized.",

Them Interfering, and in multiple cases taking over other countries. I mean Madara flat out telling muu and onnoki that they answer to the First hokage. Madara/obito(timeline isnt the best in naruto) starting the blood mist era. Orochimaru killing and subsequently taking over as 4th kazekage. Danzo fucking over the hidden rain village. . . Tbh, more and more i think about it The leaf is like america, we do that shit all the time.\n\nAs for the the great wars themselves, war is war, i not going to get mad at a country for defending itself and attacking during those times.",

She was a 12 year old complaining about her parents and saying Naruto is lucky that he doesn't have parents to punish him. \n\nThis was in chapter 3, she later on in the chapter gains some empathy for Naruto after her conversation with Sasuke and says to herself that she could be nicer to Naruto next time.\n\nThis is honestly a bad example of showing her as an entitled bitch because the point of that whole issue was for her to understand Naruto a bit, realise what she said was hurtful and then grow as a character. This was her first appearance I believe as well, that would be like me saying Naruto is in immature idiot and then justifying that with the prank he pulled in chapter 1.",

But he had a moment when he was fighting Killer B where he thought of Sakura and Naruto, before he defended his new team. I think that moment shows that despite how much Sasuke pushed them away, they still occupied a part of his mind because they were the first friends he ever had.   \n\n3) he realizes bonds/love are what made Naruto so strong, and he reverts to his old self after the final fight. He confesses his feelings for Naruto (no homo).\n\nThe reason Naruto and Sakura can forgive Sasuke so easily is because in their eyes, they don't see \"evil Sasuke\" as the real one. \n\nIt still sucks though.",

For like my entire childhood until my 20s pretty much I was mentally ill and pushed everyone I cared about away, I was self destructive, nihilist, traumatized, etc. And I'd given up on myself just like Sasuke had towards the end of the war. It was only thanks to my loved one's persistence that I came around. So like, yeah Sasuke is not a typical character to come to mind in terms of \"wow so relatable\" but at a base level and without all the theatrics and ninja shit I think there are some themes that could resonate with a lot of people. \n\nTrauma changes you and makes you say and do things that are irrational and out of character. Not an excuse for tryna kill your friends, but yeah. Sasuke wasn't evil, he was just lost and traumatized.",

The whole \"biological vs being there\" schtick that they tried to pull during her gaiden, would have worked wonders.

But he had a moment when he was fighting Killer B where he thought of Sakura and Naruto, before he defended his new team. I think that moment shows that despite how much Sasuke pushed them away, they still occupied a part of his mind because they were the first friends he ever had.   \n\n3) he realizes bonds/love are what made Naruto so strong, and he reverts to his old self after the final fight. He confesses his feelings for Naruto (no homo).\n\nThe reason Naruto and Sakura can forgive Sasuke so easily is because in their eyes, they don't see \"evil Sasuke\" as the real one. \n\nIt still sucks though.",

For like my entire childhood until my 20s pretty much I was mentally ill and pushed everyone I cared about away, I was self destructive, nihilist, traumatized, etc. And I'd given up on myself just like Sasuke had towards the end of the war. It was only thanks to my loved one's persistence that I came around. So like, yeah Sasuke is not a typical character to come to mind in terms of \"wow so relatable\" but at a base level and without all the theatrics and ninja shit I think there are some themes that could resonate with a lot of people. \n\nTrauma changes you and makes you say and do things that are irrational and out of character. Not an excuse for tryna kill your friends, but yeah. Sasuke wasn't evil, he was just lost and traumatized.",

Ie Guys and his Fathers different levels at the 7th gate.\n\nLee was much, much stronger in the war arc than when he was a kid, using 5th gate then would absolutely wreck kimimaru.\n\n>fight HASHIRAMA FOR 3 DAYS\u201d and do better than madara???? \n\nYea, madara had the 9 tails under his control, without that he would have never lasted so long against sage mode hashirama. Guy would speedblitz regular madara, unless you think youn madara was anywhere near the SO6P Madara with hashirama cells.\n\nthe two madras can't even be compared.",

But he had a moment when he was fighting Killer B where he thought of Sakura and Naruto, before he defended his new team. I think that moment shows that despite how much Sasuke pushed them away, they still occupied a part of his mind because they were the first friends he ever had.   \n\n3) he realizes bonds/love are what made Naruto so strong, and he reverts to his old self after the final fight. He confesses his feelings for Naruto (no homo).\n\nThe reason Naruto and Sakura can forgive Sasuke so easily is because in their eyes, they don't see \"evil Sasuke\" as the real one. \n\nIt still sucks though.",

Ie Guys and his Fathers different levels at the 7th gate.\n\nLee was much, much stronger in the war arc than when he was a kid, using 5th gate then would absolutely wreck kimimaru.\n\n>fight HASHIRAMA FOR 3 DAYS\u201d and do better than madara???? \n\nYea, madara had the 9 tails under his control, without that he would have never lasted so long against sage mode hashirama. Guy would speedblitz regular madara, unless you think youn madara was anywhere near the SO6P Madara with hashirama cells.\n\nthe two madras can't even be compared.",

This was her first appearance I believe as well, that would be like me saying Naruto is in immature idiot and then justifying that with the prank he pulled in chapter 1.",

Ie Guys and his Fathers different levels at the 7th gate.\n\nLee was much, much stronger in the war arc than when he was a kid, using 5th gate then would absolutely wreck kimimaru.\n\n>fight HASHIRAMA FOR 3 DAYS\u201d and do better than madara???? \n\nYea, madara had the 9 tails under his control, without that he would have never lasted so long against sage mode hashirama. Guy would speedblitz regular madara, unless you think youn madara was anywhere near the SO6P Madara with hashirama cells.\n\nthe two madras can't even be compared.",

This was her first appearance I believe as well, that would be like me saying Naruto is in immature idiot and then justifying that with the prank he pulled in chapter 1.",

Ie Guys and his Fathers different levels at the 7th gate.\n\nLee was much, much stronger in the war arc than when he was a kid, using 5th gate then would absolutely wreck kimimaru.\n\n>fight HASHIRAMA FOR 3 DAYS\u201d and do better than madara???? \n\nYea, madara had the 9 tails under his control, without that he would have never lasted so long against sage mode hashirama. Guy would speedblitz regular madara, unless you think youn madara was anywhere near the SO6P Madara with hashirama cells.\n\nthe two madras can't even be compared.",

Ie Guys and his Fathers different levels at the 7th gate.\n\nLee was much, much stronger in the war arc than when he was a kid, using 5th gate then would absolutely wreck kimimaru.\n\n>fight HASHIRAMA FOR 3 DAYS\u201d and do better than madara???? \n\nYea, madara had the 9 tails under his control, without that he would have never lasted so long against sage mode hashirama. Guy would speedblitz regular madara, unless you think youn madara was anywhere near the SO6P Madara with hashirama cells.\n\nthe two madras can't even be compared.",
