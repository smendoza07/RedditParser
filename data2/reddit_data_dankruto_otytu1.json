As good filler arcs I would say Itachi Shinden:tells you Itachis storie, The Shinobi that lives in Shadows: Kakashis Anbu Life, Power: a 5 Episode special between the war and Naruto being at the giant turtle. Personally my Fav because it doesn't look like a filler and has a great storie with some tear up moments. Maybe the boat life and the 3 tails arc but this 2 have cool moments but also pretty cringe moments. Also yes they are really bad filler like mecha naruto but this I named are pretty good and show extra infos and stuff. \n\nAlso this is my opinion. So pls accept it and tell me if you have any suggestions. :)",

As good filler arcs I would say Itachi Shinden:tells you Itachis storie, The Shinobi that lives in Shadows: Kakashis Anbu Life, Power: a 5 Episode special between the war and Naruto being at the giant turtle. Personally my Fav because it doesn't look like a filler and has a great storie with some tear up moments. Maybe the boat life and the 3 tails arc but this 2 have cool moments but also pretty cringe moments. Also yes they are really bad filler like mecha naruto but this I named are pretty good and show extra infos and stuff. \n\nAlso this is my opinion. So pls accept it and tell me if you have any suggestions. :)",
