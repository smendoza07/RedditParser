    "body": "\nUPDATE: He is amazing! Gorgeous, sweet, I think this is going to be everything I've hoped for. \n\nBefore everyone freaks out, all info has been exchanged and checked. We have facetimed 6 times, multiple phones calls, and texts. Safety plans are in place and 5 people know where I'm going to be. I'm nervous but super excited. Just took off from Nashville, headed to Dallas. Yes, he paid for my flights. Send good vibes! So many butterflies right now.",
