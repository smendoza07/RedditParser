    "body": "I (19F) met my SD (54M) on Seeking in January. When I discussed the arrangement part and financial support he told me to be careful because I was sounding like a pro and normal girls don't charge rates for sex and he told me he would just take care of me. We have had 4 dates since then and when I reminded him the first time of his promise he said I was being pushy and nothing spoils generosity like demanding. When I reminded him again today he said \"What? U need a smoothie to drink in leggings on IG?\" and then he cashapped me $13.75. I'm not so sure what to say because I don't want to be rude or ruin everything but I this is not really enough for what I think of as an arrangement. He says he will be more gnerous in the future but he hasn't bought dinner since the first time so I usually have to come to his house. How should I respond to make things clear without ruining tihngs?",

Gaslghting, which is what this asshole is doing, is rife and you need to protect yourself.\n\nI'm assuming he hasn't given you a dime for the dates you've been on? I truly hope they were not intimate dates. This man has no intention of ever giving you whatever allowance he promised you.\n\nPlease go read this post in its entirety:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/92igpx/some_possible_tips_for_new_sbs/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share",

Like what the hell? Greedy, belittling, manipulative, fetishizing, racist.. the list goes on. Honestly, tell him (text him if you prefer), that this isn't ok and that you won't continue your arrangement.. which isn't even one, because YOU don't get anything out of it. You don't want a compensation in \"the future\", you want it now! Who gives a damn about where you are from, you live in Nebraska as well and have the same terrible bills as everyone else! 14 bucks (for a drink you can post on IG - yikes!) won't cover your bills. Or a pair of pants. I know starting from zero again comes with uncertainty, especially when you (sorry for the assumption) seem to be dealing with insecurities, but in this case there absolutely won't be a loss and you will be better off without him.\n\nDon't believe empty promises of men, if they don't follow up asap with it in this business. They use you.\n\nI'm sorry you have to experience this and hope things will get better quickly.\n\nEdit: fixed some typos because I straight up forgot words out of anger lmao",

You dont wanna marry a broke man who makes u pay for bills or makes u work 3 days after u had a baby! This works also for normal relationships! Please please listen to me!!!!\n\nI feel so aggravated he has used you for sex without any sugar! And then he cashapped you 14! \n\nThat\u2019s outrageous! I hope you protected yourself babe\u2026 You are very young and need to learn how to set firm boundaries specially with those men who are complete strangers\u2026 Read many self-love books, watch youtube videos,go to the gym\u2026 Love yourself!! When you do, you attract exactly that! Never sell yourself short. One of my friends told me once, back when I was dumb: you think they wanna be friends with u? They want your \u2026 so you want their money on their wallets!!!! And that\u2019s what I do! If he keeps me happy, I make him feel the happiest, I don\u2019t even have to mention I need anything because he is always one step forward, as I am too!",

Sounds like he's been on the \"other\" Reddit forum. \nFor bitter, cheap, terrible potential SDs /salt Daddys.. and maybe incels pretending to be wealthy to get laid.\nThey talk about how sex isn't really worth more than fifty. \nAnd they advise things like (not directly quoted): Promise her an allowance but never deliver. If she insists, you flip the script and paint her as the greedy \"bad-guy\". Meanwhile, he can f**k for free, while continuing to shop around for his next mark.. \n\"Men\" on Reddit are teaching each other: Haggle and/or avoid. And Never pay to play if you don't HAVE to. \nBut a general SB rule is Never play before pay. Or at least, not before a DIRECT discussion about ppm/allowance. Start with a ppm. Discussed before you are unclothed. Advance to allowance if/when it suits you both.\n A classy SD won't make you ask twice. You'll discuss Ppm /allowance. Then he'll find a discreet way to give you an envelope(or somesuch). It should be AFTER the initial meet and greet. But before private time. \n You got played this time. It happens. Learn. Rally. Move forward.\nYou might try removing your original profile from wherever you found THAT guy and starting fresh. He likely has scumbag friends that he shares things with. Like tips to scam.",

He is using you / playing you. He's playing on your naivete and desperation and you need to get smart and find someone (anyone) else. For you, it sounds like you are starved for attention from a father figure and are putting yourself in a desperate situation to get that attention.  That's not what sugaring is about.\n\nOriginally, a sugar relationship evolved because an older, financially established man and a young woman developed feelings and a relationship with each other first. Then, he offered to help her with her financial situation in order to improve her lot in life with financial support. But, with the internet, that scenario has been flipped on its head.\n\nIt doesn't seem like you are in the previous scenario. You meet this man with the intention of him being your SD. But, the relationship seems to be one-sided: you're providing sugar but, he is not. In no way should you see this predator again until he pays you - if you are giving us the real story.

Like, even if you get an SD who's into East Asian women mainly, chances are he would still treat you 1000\u00d7 better than THIS guy, who gives you a \"you're from Taiwan, so 14 bucks is already a lot for you\". Like what the hell? Greedy, belittling, manipulative, fetishizing, racist.. the list goes on. Honestly, tell him (text him if you prefer), that this isn't ok and that you won't continue your arrangement.. which isn't even one, because YOU don't get anything out of it. You don't want a compensation in \"the future\", you want it now! Who gives a damn about where you are from, you live in Nebraska as well and have the same terrible bills as everyone else! 14 bucks (for a drink you can post on IG - yikes!) won't cover your bills. Or a pair of pants. I know starting from zero again comes with uncertainty, especially when you (sorry for the assumption) seem to be dealing with insecurities, but in this case there absolutely won't be a loss and you will be better off without him.\n\nDon't believe empty promises of men, if they don't follow up asap with it in this business. They use you.\n\nI'm sorry you have to experience this and hope things will get better quickly.\n\nEdit: fixed some typos because I straight up forgot words out of anger lmao",

I feel sorry for her to have met him. The good thing for her is that ignorance can be repaired by knowledge and experience.\n\nHe looks like a low-life, sociopathic abuser who manipulates young ladies for fun.

Like what the hell? Greedy, belittling, manipulative, fetishizing, racist.. the list goes on. Honestly, tell him (text him if you prefer), that this isn't ok and that you won't continue your arrangement.. which isn't even one, because YOU don't get anything out of it. You don't want a compensation in \"the future\", you want it now! Who gives a damn about where you are from, you live in Nebraska as well and have the same terrible bills as everyone else! 14 bucks (for a drink you can post on IG - yikes!) won't cover your bills. Or a pair of pants. I know starting from zero again comes with uncertainty, especially when you (sorry for the assumption) seem to be dealing with insecurities, but in this case there absolutely won't be a loss and you will be better off without him.\n\nDon't believe empty promises of men, if they don't follow up asap with it in this business. They use you.\n\nI'm sorry you have to experience this and hope things will get better quickly.\n\nEdit: fixed some typos because I straight up forgot words out of anger lmao",
