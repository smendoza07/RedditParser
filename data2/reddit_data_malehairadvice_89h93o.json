Try not schampoing so much (like only once or twice a week) and use conditioner. Also try getting some argan oil too, smells good and your hair becomes a bit more manageable and nice.\n\nAlso try this: Shower first, and when the hair is damp, let your mom or someone braid into a big braid at the back. Then you let the braid sit in for a couple of hours or even sleep with it (I've started doing this). When you wake up and unleash the braid, holy shit.. It's gonna look epic with all the waves and hair pushed back and everything. And the best part is, the hair continous to be wavy until the next time you shower!",
