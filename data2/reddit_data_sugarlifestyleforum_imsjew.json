I would not be offended if a man asked which way I usually wore it. \nStop making things out to be racist that were never that way in the first place. Stop shaming people for behavior that was never done. Stop looking to find offense at every littld thing. In a way you are saying this woman needs your help to come to her rescue bc she's a victim and can't help herself and needs you to speak up on how she feels. YOU are acting like a privileged brat here.",

Stop shaming people for behavior that was never done. Stop looking to find offense at every littld thing.

I would not be offended if a man asked which way I usually wore it. \nStop making things out to be racist that were never that way in the first place. Stop shaming people for behavior that was never done. Stop looking to find offense at every littld thing. In a way you are saying this woman needs your help to come to her rescue bc she's a victim and can't help herself and needs you to speak up on how she feels.

I would not be offended if a man asked which way I usually wore it. \nStop making things out to be racist that were never that way in the first place. Stop shaming people for behavior that was never done. Stop looking to find offense at every littld thing. In a way you are saying this woman needs your help to come to her rescue bc she's a victim and can't help herself and needs you to speak up on how she feels.

I would not be offended if a man asked which way I usually wore it. \nStop making things out to be racist that were never that way in the first place. Stop shaming people for behavior that was never done. Stop looking to find offense at every littld thing. In a way you are saying this woman needs your help to come to her rescue bc she's a victim and can't help herself and needs you to speak up on how she feels.

Stop shaming people for behavior that was never done. Stop looking to find offense at every littld thing. In a way you are saying this woman needs your help to come to her rescue bc she's a victim and can't help herself and needs you to speak up on how she feels. YOU are acting like a privileged brat here.",

I would not be offended if a man asked which way I usually wore it. \nStop making things out to be racist that were never that way in the first place. Stop shaming people for behavior that was never done. Stop looking to find offense at every littld thing. In a way you are saying this woman needs your help to come to her rescue bc she's a victim and can't help herself and needs you to speak up on how she feels. YOU are acting like a privileged brat here.",

Let's say in one photo white woman had natural and short hair and in the other pics she's got long hair....or maybe she has purple hair in other pics. How is it wrong to ask which way she wears it?
