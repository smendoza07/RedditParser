    "body": "Never ceases to amaze me how many SDs (guys in general really) want unprotected sex despite barely knowing each other & knowing what type of site we\u2019ve met on. 9/10 SDs will ask if I am on birth control, and if I confirm that I am (which I am for *myself* & my own piece of mind), they assume that me being on bc means I will have unprotected sex w/them. I\u2019m assuming the majority of women experience this as well in & out of the bowl.\n\nWhile there is the occasional guy who just wants to know for reassurance *and* still wants to use protection, the majority actually use this question as a manipulative pua tactic. It\u2019s similar to some sales tactics. They ask if you are on bc, you say yes b/c you\u2019re simply answering honestly, they respond affirmatively & enthusiastically about you two not needing condoms (or if you\u2019re in the moment will simply try to proceed w/o a condom) despite you never agreeing to not using protection or even having a discussion about it. The onus is now on you to correct & disappoint them. They do this hoping & knowing some girls will be too uncomfortable to correct them. (Think\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t you see yourself driving this car?\u201d \u201cOf course I can, I love it.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s start drawing up the papers.\u201d Reductive of the sales tactic, but that\u2019s the gist of what\u2019s going on when men do this.) Works well on young girls (I know it worked well when I was younger) & those who struggle w/keeping their boundaries.\n\nA *healthy & genuine* convo about protection would be them straight up asking about protection & what you feel safe with, not asking about whether or not you\u2019re on birth control & trying to avoid a direct convo about it. Please, please remember this.\n\nI don\u2019t even acknowledge this question anymore & it\u2019s been one of my best decisions. I simply respond that I always use condoms. Nothing else to talk about, & if the convo dies then fine by me. If they\u2019re legitimately asking b/c they\u2019re concerned about pregnancy, then not only will they want to have a discussion about it, but they will not be bothered that you insist on condoms.",

Interestingly, in all my prior arrangements, the SBs did not want to use a condom without me stating my preference beforehand.

Do you actually think that a PUA will not ask to ditch condoms if you don't answer the question, or even if you say no?  Grow up and have an adult conversation.\n\nAlso, if you wanted to provide actual useful advice then you should be advising SBs to ask for condom use to start along with STD test results exchanged before intimacy.  It's the safest route for everyone involved, and you can adjust protection from there based on both of your preferences.  \n\nThe vast majority of SBs in the bowl are comfortable moving forward without condoms, so let's aim our advice at the current reality rather than your anecdotal preference.",

Also fun fact\u2014 HIV & Herpes are viruses & can take several weeks to sometimes 3 months before they can be detected in blood tests after being contracted. STD tests AND condoms are the safest route for everyone involved, and only unprotected sex after a long-term arrangement has been established & you\u2019ve both agreed to exclusivity. Like fuck all am I going to fuck a dude w/o a condom b/c he provided an STD test from a week or two ago when I have no reassurance if or who he\u2019s still seeing or speaking with & when I have no idea when the last time he\u2019s been intimate with someone.\n\nBut keep up w/pressuring women younger than you to fuck w/o condoms bruh, you seem like a winner.",

PUAs, or men seeking to not use condoms, are not going to be dissuaded by you ignoring the question of whether you are or are not on BC.  You are going to have to stand tall and state that you are/are not on BC and expect to always use condoms regardless of your answer because that is your personal preference.  Anything else is kicking the conversation down the road where it might be harder or more uncomfortable to deal with.\n\nI always bring up exchanging STD results first, and start the discussion about current and future sexual partners.  Does that mean that all women are abandoning their responsibility to broach that conversation first?  No, unlike you I choose not to generalize an entire gender based on my experiences.\n\nAny references to your maturity have to do with your primary suggestion for avoidance, a common immature response to hard conversations, and your decision to jump to personal attacks when your statements are questioned rather than attempting to supplement your opinion with facts or additional information.

So while congrats to you for not personally behaving like these same men, you do not get to \u201cnot all men\u201d dismiss that it\u2019s something that women frequently experience just b/c you don\u2019t personally do it yourself.\n\nSecond\u2014 you do not have to be a full blown PUA to try PUA tactics. There are plenty of men who will try manipulative boundary-testing, pickup-artistry, emotional guilt tripping, & pressuring type tactics but aren\u2019t full blown PUAs. Many people will simply try just to try. So sure, maybe this won\u2019t work on full blown PUAs\u2014 but the dudes who try just to test your boundaries to see what they can get away with? Clearly hasn\u2019t been so bad so far if I\u2019m preferring to stick to this rather than deal this these constant convos defending why I use condoms.\n\nMe responding to the birth control question this way actually works very great for me, & it is not out of \u201cavoidance\u201d of a \u201chard conversation,\u201d and what\u2019s truly ironic is you claiming that *I\u2019m* avoiding the conversation when many of these men often ask about BC and will try to assume BC = no protection solely so they themselves can avoid a conversation about protection. *I don\u2019t even lie & say I\u2019m not on birth control.* My suggestion is to cut through the bullshit & very bluntly say you require condoms when asked, and to shut down a very common manipulative tactic to get past your boundaries & requirement for protection. I see no need to defend my decision to use condoms or to even entertain the discussion before anything has been established. Responding to the question this way establishes my boundaries very quickly, and I have not had to deal w/anywhere near the same amount of emotional guilt tripping that I used to get when I say that I am on birth control but still want to use condoms. I establish very early on that condoms are expected & don\u2019t leave any wiggle room, and again, I see no problems with this. Is it absolutely full-proof? Of course not\u2014 I had one guy ask about just pulling out. And if they are truly concerned about pregnancies & birthcontol is something that they legitimately need for their sb to be on, then they will typically want to discuss that more. So yes, it works. It shuts down the no-condom assumptions just b/c I\u2019m on bc before they even have them.",

Not all men rape you in an alleyway either, does that mean women should walk home alone at 2am totally unprotected and unaware of their surroundings?\n\nAnd again, are some men asking b/c they\u2019re concerned about pregnancy scares \u2014 sure. And again, as I\u2019ve mentioned *in my post & in comments*, they\u2019ll want to talk about it more if that\u2019s one of their legitimate concerns. But do an overwhelming amount of men conflate birth control with whether or not they need to wear condoms, and the answer is _overwhelmingly yes and this has been both my & other women\u2019s experiences and you can see that in the responses from other sbs in this thread alone._\n\nYou like to conveniently claim that this is simply anecdotal when it\u2019s not. It is in in fact something women experience very frequently from the time they become sexually active. Sexual coercion, from having sex before you\u2019re ready, to testing your boundaries, to trying to emotionally manipulate you or circumvent your boundaries around protection, are very much real. \n\nAnd simply b/c I have only been in the bowl for a few months does not mean I do not have experience with men or with dating. Truthfully, the biggest difference is that the bowl moves faster, it\u2019s more honest to an extent, & people are more clear about their needs and expectations. Other than that, the very beginning is not too different, esp when screening for red flags and shitty behavior. \n\nBut sure, let\u2019s hope young new SBs who are often more prone to manipulation listen to SDs who quickly get offended by any post criticizing men & advocating for women & who have incentive to mislead SBs, rather than listening to other women. That 100% makes perfect sense here. Like you are legit arguing against a woman clearly stating she wants condoms, *which is a form of birth control so it\u2019s not even inaccurate*, because you don\u2019t like... the approach? Because she\u2019s not being polite & apologetic enough when she does it? Because she\u2019s not disclosing she\u2019s on a second birth control method? Because you don\u2019t appreciate that the opportunity to manipulate her has been shut down before you even have the chance? Because that\u2019s what it seems like bruh. You literally have zero experience on the woman\u2019s end and while, boohoo you deal with scammers who are trying to take your money, some of which are actually men w/fake profiles, women have to deal w/a type of scammer who will quite literally put our health & safety & lives at risk if we put our guards down. You dealing w/girls trying to get you to subscribe to their onlyfans is not in anyway the same as protecting my health & safety, and if this wasn\u2019t a _constant_ pattern that I have run up against time & again, I wouldn\u2019t post about it.",

That is a lot of words that could have made your points, illogical as they are, in 1/10th the space.  I almost gave up bothering to reply, I wonder if that was your aim all along.  I'll respond to the few parts worth mentioning.\n\nI don't have a problem with a women being direct, in fact if your genius suggestion was to clearly state that you are/are not on BC but will always require condoms then I wouldn't have even responded to your post.  What I have a problem with is you dodging the question because you assume the worst of any that asks it, and suggest that others take on the same ridiculous assumption.  As I stated previously, not only is it founded only on your experience (there are as many comments with conflicting view points to yours as there are SBs backing up your statement), but it doesn't solve the problem!  If I asked if you were on BC and you ignored it and just said always condoms, I would assume you were illiterate, idiotic, or were hoping down the road for a broken condom to give me the most costly STD of all, pregnancy.\n\nThe only reason I responded to your post is because I THINK YOUR ADVICE IS NOT GOOD.  Not that women shouldn't be direct, and not that you shouldn't clearly state your preference for condoms.  I know you ar avoiding this clear point since, again, it invalidates your post.  Unlike you, I'll refrain from making assumptions about your character or the reason you made the post in the first place and merely let your flawed argument stand for itself.",

There's a choice to make and responsibility for those choices. The victim mentality allows people to mentally avoid taking personal responsibility. Frankly the woman card is a cheap and intellectually dishonest argument. When you play that card too many times it loses it meaning. It devalues a woman's personal agency by saying she's not capable of making her own decisions or accepting the consequences of her decisions. It's like a woman saying she had to sleep a guy because he was too charming and attractive to resist so she's not responsible for it.",

PUAs, or men seeking to not use condoms, are not going to be dissuaded by you ignoring the question of whether you are or are not on BC.  You are going to have to stand tall and state that you are/are not on BC and expect to always use condoms regardless of your answer because that is your personal preference.

Does that mean that all women are abandoning their responsibility to broach that conversation first?  No, unlike you I choose not to generalize an entire gender based on my experiences.\n\nAny references to your maturity have to do with your primary suggestion for avoidance, a common immature response to hard conversations, and your decision to jump to personal attacks when your statements are questioned rather than attempting to supplement your opinion with facts or additional information.  The fact that you've been in the bowl for only a few months and feel that you have the depth of knowledge to make such suggestions also speaks to a certain level of immaturity.",

I can tell you right now any women with any dating history in & out of the bowl has experienced this. It\u2019s not \u201canecdotal\u201d when it\u2019s a pattern among a group. So while congrats to you for not personally behaving like these same men, you do not get to \u201cnot all men\u201d dismiss that it\u2019s something that women frequently experience just b/c you don\u2019t personally do it yourself.\n\nSecond\u2014 you do not have to be a full blown PUA to try PUA tactics. There are plenty of men who will try manipulative boundary-testing, pickup-artistry, emotional guilt tripping, & pressuring type tactics but aren\u2019t full blown PUAs. Many people will simply try just to try. So sure, maybe this won\u2019t work on full blown PUAs\u2014 but the dudes who try just to test your boundaries to see what they can get away with? Clearly hasn\u2019t been so bad so far if I\u2019m preferring to stick to this rather than deal this these constant convos defending why I use condoms.\n\nMe responding to the birth control question this way actually works very great for me, & it is not out of \u201cavoidance\u201d of a \u201chard conversation,\u201d and what\u2019s truly ironic is you claiming that *I\u2019m* avoiding the conversation when many of these men often ask about BC and will try to assume BC = no protection solely so they themselves can avoid a conversation about protection. *I don\u2019t even lie & say I\u2019m not on birth control.* My suggestion is to cut through the bullshit & very bluntly say you require condoms when asked, and to shut down a very common manipulative tactic to get past your boundaries & requirement for protection. I see no need to defend my decision to use condoms or to even entertain the discussion before anything has been established. Responding to the question this way establishes my boundaries very quickly, and I have not had to deal w/anywhere near the same amount of emotional guilt tripping that I used to get when I say that I am on birth control but still want to use condoms. I establish very early on that condoms are expected & don\u2019t leave any wiggle room, and again, I see no problems with this. Is it absolutely full-proof? Of course not\u2014 I had one guy ask about just pulling out. And if they are truly concerned about pregnancies & birthcontol is something that they legitimately need for their sb to be on, then they will typically want to discuss that more. So yes, it works. It shuts down the no-condom assumptions just b/c I\u2019m on bc before they even have them.",

For being in the bowl such a short time your perception of men and SDs in general is incredibly bitter and jaded, that's not a good sign.\n\nDo I deal with scammers and people with bad intentions when I am searching for a new SB?  Of course I do.  What I don't do is develop tactics based on the actions of the bad actors and apply it universally to everyone I encounter.  Better screening can help you avoid these people faster and faster as you get more experience.\n\nYou can go on shouting condoms for life until you are blue in the face.  In fact, the first sentence of my first reply to your post agreed that YOU could chose to do whatever you want in regards to how you operate in the bowl.

Not all men rape you in an alleyway either, does that mean women should walk home alone at 2am totally unprotected and unaware of their surroundings?\n\nAnd again, are some men asking b/c they\u2019re concerned about pregnancy scares \u2014 sure. And again, as I\u2019ve mentioned *in my post & in comments*, they\u2019ll want to talk about it more if that\u2019s one of their legitimate concerns. But do an overwhelming amount of men conflate birth control with whether or not they need to wear condoms, and the answer is _overwhelmingly yes and this has been both my & other women\u2019s experiences and you can see that in the responses from other sbs in this thread alone._\n\nYou like to conveniently claim that this is simply anecdotal when it\u2019s not. It is in in fact something women experience very frequently from the time they become sexually active. Sexual coercion, from having sex before you\u2019re ready, to testing your boundaries, to trying to emotionally manipulate you or circumvent your boundaries around protection, are very much real. \n\nAnd simply b/c I have only been in the bowl for a few months does not mean I do not have experience with men or with dating. Truthfully, the biggest difference is that the bowl moves faster, it\u2019s more honest to an extent, & people are more clear about their needs and expectations. Other than that, the very beginning is not too different, esp when screening for red flags and shitty behavior. \n\nBut sure, let\u2019s hope young new SBs who are often more prone to manipulation listen to SDs who quickly get offended by any post criticizing men & advocating for women & who have incentive to mislead SBs, rather than listening to other women. That 100% makes perfect sense here. Like you are legit arguing against a woman clearly stating she wants condoms, *which is a form of birth control so it\u2019s not even inaccurate*, because you don\u2019t like... the approach? Because she\u2019s not being polite & apologetic enough when she does it? Because she\u2019s not disclosing she\u2019s on a second birth control method? Because you don\u2019t appreciate that the opportunity to manipulate her has been shut down before you even have the chance? Because that\u2019s what it seems like bruh. You literally have zero experience on the woman\u2019s end and while, boohoo you deal with scammers who are trying to take your money, some of which are actually men w/fake profiles, women have to deal w/a type of scammer who will quite literally put our health & safety & lives at risk if we put our guards down. You dealing w/girls trying to get you to subscribe to their onlyfans is not in anyway the same as protecting my health & safety, and if this wasn\u2019t a _constant_ pattern that I have run up against time & again, I wouldn\u2019t post about it.",

I'll respond to the few parts worth mentioning.\n\nI don't have a problem with a women being direct, in fact if your genius suggestion was to clearly state that you are/are not on BC but will always require condoms then I wouldn't have even responded to your post.  What I have a problem with is you dodging the question because you assume the worst of any that asks it, and suggest that others take on the same ridiculous assumption.  As I stated previously, not only is it founded only on your experience (there are as many comments with conflicting view points to yours as there are SBs backing up your statement), but it doesn't solve the problem!  If I asked if you were on BC and you ignored it and just said always condoms, I would assume you were illiterate, idiotic, or were hoping down the road for a broken condom to give me the most costly STD of all, pregnancy.\n\nThe only reason I responded to your post is because I THINK YOUR ADVICE IS NOT GOOD.  Not that women shouldn't be direct, and not that you shouldn't clearly state your preference for condoms.  I know you ar avoiding this clear point since, again, it invalidates your post.

Your argument is a straw man. I'm talking about taking responsibility for your own actions. Is there leverage there? Sure, she wants to continue the SR and there is a financial incentive. Fine. There's a choice to make and responsibility for those choices. The victim mentality allows people to mentally avoid taking personal responsibility. Frankly the woman card is a cheap and intellectually dishonest argument. When you play that card too many times it loses it meaning. It devalues a woman's personal agency by saying she's not capable of making her own decisions or accepting the consequences of her decisions. It's like a woman saying she had to sleep a guy because he was too charming and attractive to resist so she's not responsible for it.",

PUAs, or men seeking to not use condoms, are not going to be dissuaded by you ignoring the question of whether you are or are not on BC.  You are going to have to stand tall and state that you are/are not on BC and expect to always use condoms regardless of your answer because that is your personal preference.  Anything else is kicking the conversation down the road where it might be harder or more uncomfortable to deal with.\n\nI always bring up exchanging STD results first, and start the discussion about current and future sexual partners.  Does that mean that all women are abandoning their responsibility to broach that conversation first?  No, unlike you I choose not to generalize an entire gender based on my experiences.\n\nAny references to your maturity have to do with your primary suggestion for avoidance, a common immature response to hard conversations, and your decision to jump to personal attacks when your statements are questioned rather than attempting to supplement your opinion with facts or additional information.  The fact that you've been in the bowl for only a few months and feel that you have the depth of knowledge to make such suggestions also speaks to a certain level of immaturity.",

There are plenty of men who will try manipulative boundary-testing, pickup-artistry, emotional guilt tripping, & pressuring type tactics but aren\u2019t full blown PUAs. Many people will simply try just to try. So sure, maybe this won\u2019t work on full blown PUAs\u2014 but the dudes who try just to test your boundaries to see what they can get away with? Clearly hasn\u2019t been so bad so far if I\u2019m preferring to stick to this rather than deal this these constant convos defending why I use condoms.\n\nMe responding to the birth control question this way actually works very great for me, & it is not out of \u201cavoidance\u201d of a \u201chard conversation,\u201d and what\u2019s truly ironic is you claiming that *I\u2019m* avoiding the conversation when many of these men often ask about BC and will try to assume BC = no protection solely so they themselves can avoid a conversation about protection. *I don\u2019t even lie & say I\u2019m not on birth control.* My suggestion is to cut through the bullshit & very bluntly say you require condoms when asked, and to shut down a very common manipulative tactic to get past your boundaries & requirement for protection. I see no need to defend my decision to use condoms or to even entertain the discussion before anything has been established. Responding to the question this way establishes my boundaries very quickly, and I have not had to deal w/anywhere near the same amount of emotional guilt tripping that I used to get when I say that I am on birth control but still want to use condoms. I establish very early on that condoms are expected & don\u2019t leave any wiggle room, and again, I see no problems with this. Is it absolutely full-proof? Of course not\u2014 I had one guy ask about just pulling out. And if they are truly concerned about pregnancies & birthcontol is something that they legitimately need for their sb to be on, then they will typically want to discuss that more. So yes, it works.

For being in the bowl such a short time your perception of men and SDs in general is incredibly bitter and jaded, that's not a good sign.\n\nDo I deal with scammers and people with bad intentions when I am searching for a new SB?  Of course I do.  What I don't do is develop tactics based on the actions of the bad actors and apply it universally to everyone I encounter.  Better screening can help you avoid these people faster and faster as you get more experience.\n\nYou can go on shouting condoms for life until you are blue in the face.  In fact, the first sentence of my first reply to your post agreed that YOU could chose to do whatever you want in regards to how you operate in the bowl.  What I take issue with is you proclaiming that the process you have developed for yourself should be copied by others, especially newer SBs.",

Not all men rape you in an alleyway either, does that mean women should walk home alone at 2am totally unprotected and unaware of their surroundings?\n\nAnd again, are some men asking b/c they\u2019re concerned about pregnancy scares \u2014 sure. And again, as I\u2019ve mentioned *in my post & in comments*, they\u2019ll want to talk about it more if that\u2019s one of their legitimate concerns. But do an overwhelming amount of men conflate birth control with whether or not they need to wear condoms, and the answer is _overwhelmingly yes and this has been both my & other women\u2019s experiences and you can see that in the responses from other sbs in this thread alone._\n\nYou like to conveniently claim that this is simply anecdotal when it\u2019s not. It is in in fact something women experience very frequently from the time they become sexually active. Sexual coercion, from having sex before you\u2019re ready, to testing your boundaries, to trying to emotionally manipulate you or circumvent your boundaries around protection, are very much real. \n\nAnd simply b/c I have only been in the bowl for a few months does not mean I do not have experience with men or with dating. Truthfully, the biggest difference is that the bowl moves faster, it\u2019s more honest to an extent, & people are more clear about their needs and expectations. Other than that, the very beginning is not too different, esp when screening for red flags and shitty behavior. \n\nBut sure, let\u2019s hope young new SBs who are often more prone to manipulation listen to SDs who quickly get offended by any post criticizing men & advocating for women & who have incentive to mislead SBs, rather than listening to other women. That 100% makes perfect sense here. Like you are legit arguing against a woman clearly stating she wants condoms, *which is a form of birth control so it\u2019s not even inaccurate*, because you don\u2019t like... the approach? Because she\u2019s not being polite & apologetic enough when she does it? Because she\u2019s not disclosing she\u2019s on a second birth control method? Because you don\u2019t appreciate that the opportunity to manipulate her has been shut down before you even have the chance? Because that\u2019s what it seems like bruh. You literally have zero experience on the woman\u2019s end and while, boohoo you deal with scammers who are trying to take your money, some of which are actually men w/fake profiles, women have to deal w/a type of scammer who will quite literally put our health & safety & lives at risk if we put our guards down. You dealing w/girls trying to get you to subscribe to their onlyfans is not in anyway the same as protecting my health & safety, and if this wasn\u2019t a _constant_ pattern that I have run up against time & again, I wouldn\u2019t post about it.",

I'll respond to the few parts worth mentioning.\n\nI don't have a problem with a women being direct, in fact if your genius suggestion was to clearly state that you are/are not on BC but will always require condoms then I wouldn't have even responded to your post.  What I have a problem with is you dodging the question because you assume the worst of any that asks it, and suggest that others take on the same ridiculous assumption.  As I stated previously, not only is it founded only on your experience (there are as many comments with conflicting view points to yours as there are SBs backing up your statement), but it doesn't solve the problem!  If I asked if you were on BC and you ignored it and just said always condoms, I would assume you were illiterate, idiotic, or were hoping down the road for a broken condom to give me the most costly STD of all, pregnancy.\n\nThe only reason I responded to your post is because I THINK YOUR ADVICE IS NOT GOOD.  Not that women shouldn't be direct, and not that you shouldn't clearly state your preference for condoms.  I know you ar avoiding this clear point since, again, it invalidates your post.

PUAs, or men seeking to not use condoms, are not going to be dissuaded by you ignoring the question of whether you are or are not on BC.  You are going to have to stand tall and state that you are/are not on BC and expect to always use condoms regardless of your answer because that is your personal preference.  Anything else is kicking the conversation down the road where it might be harder or more uncomfortable to deal with.\n\nI always bring up exchanging STD results first, and start the discussion about current and future sexual partners.  Does that mean that all women are abandoning their responsibility to broach that conversation first?  No, unlike you I choose not to generalize an entire gender based on my experiences.\n\nAny references to your maturity have to do with your primary suggestion for avoidance, a common immature response to hard conversations, and your decision to jump to personal attacks when your statements are questioned rather than attempting to supplement your opinion with facts or additional information.  The fact that you've been in the bowl for only a few months and feel that you have the depth of knowledge to make such suggestions also speaks to a certain level of immaturity.",

There are plenty of men who will try manipulative boundary-testing, pickup-artistry, emotional guilt tripping, & pressuring type tactics but aren\u2019t full blown PUAs. Many people will simply try just to try. So sure, maybe this won\u2019t work on full blown PUAs\u2014 but the dudes who try just to test your boundaries to see what they can get away with? Clearly hasn\u2019t been so bad so far if I\u2019m preferring to stick to this rather than deal this these constant convos defending why I use condoms.\n\nMe responding to the birth control question this way actually works very great for me, & it is not out of \u201cavoidance\u201d of a \u201chard conversation,\u201d and what\u2019s truly ironic is you claiming that *I\u2019m* avoiding the conversation when many of these men often ask about BC and will try to assume BC = no protection solely so they themselves can avoid a conversation about protection. *I don\u2019t even lie & say I\u2019m not on birth control.* My suggestion is to cut through the bullshit & very bluntly say you require condoms when asked, and to shut down a very common manipulative tactic to get past your boundaries & requirement for protection. I see no need to defend my decision to use condoms or to even entertain the discussion before anything has been established. Responding to the question this way establishes my boundaries very quickly, and I have not had to deal w/anywhere near the same amount of emotional guilt tripping that I used to get when I say that I am on birth control but still want to use condoms. I establish very early on that condoms are expected & don\u2019t leave any wiggle room, and again, I see no problems with this. Is it absolutely full-proof? Of course not\u2014 I had one guy ask about just pulling out. And if they are truly concerned about pregnancies & birthcontol is something that they legitimately need for their sb to be on, then they will typically want to discuss that more. So yes, it works. It shuts down the no-condom assumptions just b/c I\u2019m on bc before they even have them.",

Not all men rape you in an alleyway either, does that mean women should walk home alone at 2am totally unprotected and unaware of their surroundings?\n\nAnd again, are some men asking b/c they\u2019re concerned about pregnancy scares \u2014 sure. And again, as I\u2019ve mentioned *in my post & in comments*, they\u2019ll want to talk about it more if that\u2019s one of their legitimate concerns. But do an overwhelming amount of men conflate birth control with whether or not they need to wear condoms, and the answer is _overwhelmingly yes and this has been both my & other women\u2019s experiences and you can see that in the responses from other sbs in this thread alone._\n\nYou like to conveniently claim that this is simply anecdotal when it\u2019s not. It is in in fact something women experience very frequently from the time they become sexually active. Sexual coercion, from having sex before you\u2019re ready, to testing your boundaries, to trying to emotionally manipulate you or circumvent your boundaries around protection, are very much real. \n\nAnd simply b/c I have only been in the bowl for a few months does not mean I do not have experience with men or with dating. Truthfully, the biggest difference is that the bowl moves faster, it\u2019s more honest to an extent, & people are more clear about their needs and expectations. Other than that, the very beginning is not too different, esp when screening for red flags and shitty behavior. \n\nBut sure, let\u2019s hope young new SBs who are often more prone to manipulation listen to SDs who quickly get offended by any post criticizing men & advocating for women & who have incentive to mislead SBs, rather than listening to other women. That 100% makes perfect sense here. Like you are legit arguing against a woman clearly stating she wants condoms, *which is a form of birth control so it\u2019s not even inaccurate*, because you don\u2019t like... the approach? Because she\u2019s not being polite & apologetic enough when she does it? Because she\u2019s not disclosing she\u2019s on a second birth control method? Because you don\u2019t appreciate that the opportunity to manipulate her has been shut down before you even have the chance? Because that\u2019s what it seems like bruh. You literally have zero experience on the woman\u2019s end and while, boohoo you deal with scammers who are trying to take your money, some of which are actually men w/fake profiles, women have to deal w/a type of scammer who will quite literally put our health & safety & lives at risk if we put our guards down. You dealing w/girls trying to get you to subscribe to their onlyfans is not in anyway the same as protecting my health & safety, and if this wasn\u2019t a _constant_ pattern that I have run up against time & again, I wouldn\u2019t post about it.",

As I stated previously, not only is it founded only on your experience (there are as many comments with conflicting view points to yours as there are SBs backing up your statement), but it doesn't solve the problem!  If I asked if you were on BC and you ignored it and just said always condoms, I would assume you were illiterate, idiotic, or were hoping down the road for a broken condom to give me the most costly STD of all, pregnancy.\n\nThe only reason I responded to your post is because I THINK YOUR ADVICE IS NOT GOOD.  Not that women shouldn't be direct, and not that you shouldn't clearly state your preference for condoms.  I know you ar avoiding this clear point since, again, it invalidates your post.  Unlike you, I'll refrain from making assumptions about your character or the reason you made the post in the first place and merely let your flawed argument stand for itself.",

PUAs, or men seeking to not use condoms, are not going to be dissuaded by you ignoring the question of whether you are or are not on BC.  You are going to have to stand tall and state that you are/are not on BC and expect to always use condoms regardless of your answer because that is your personal preference.  Anything else is kicking the conversation down the road where it might be harder or more uncomfortable to deal with.\n\nI always bring up exchanging STD results first, and start the discussion about current and future sexual partners.  Does that mean that all women are abandoning their responsibility to broach that conversation first?  No, unlike you I choose not to generalize an entire gender based on my experiences.\n\nAny references to your maturity have to do with your primary suggestion for avoidance, a common immature response to hard conversations, and your decision to jump to personal attacks when your statements are questioned rather than attempting to supplement your opinion with facts or additional information.  The fact that you've been in the bowl for only a few months and feel that you have the depth of knowledge to make such suggestions also speaks to a certain level of immaturity.",

So while congrats to you for not personally behaving like these same men, you do not get to \u201cnot all men\u201d dismiss that it\u2019s something that women frequently experience just b/c you don\u2019t personally do it yourself.\n\nSecond\u2014 you do not have to be a full blown PUA to try PUA tactics. There are plenty of men who will try manipulative boundary-testing, pickup-artistry, emotional guilt tripping, & pressuring type tactics but aren\u2019t full blown PUAs. Many people will simply try just to try. So sure, maybe this won\u2019t work on full blown PUAs\u2014 but the dudes who try just to test your boundaries to see what they can get away with? Clearly hasn\u2019t been so bad so far if I\u2019m preferring to stick to this rather than deal this these constant convos defending why I use condoms.\n\nMe responding to the birth control question this way actually works very great for me, & it is not out of \u201cavoidance\u201d of a \u201chard conversation,\u201d and what\u2019s truly ironic is you claiming that *I\u2019m* avoiding the conversation when many of these men often ask about BC and will try to assume BC = no protection solely so they themselves can avoid a conversation about protection. *I don\u2019t even lie & say I\u2019m not on birth control.* My suggestion is to cut through the bullshit & very bluntly say you require condoms when asked, and to shut down a very common manipulative tactic to get past your boundaries & requirement for protection. I see no need to defend my decision to use condoms or to even entertain the discussion before anything has been established. Responding to the question this way establishes my boundaries very quickly, and I have not had to deal w/anywhere near the same amount of emotional guilt tripping that I used to get when I say that I am on birth control but still want to use condoms. I establish very early on that condoms are expected & don\u2019t leave any wiggle room, and again, I see no problems with this. Is it absolutely full-proof? Of course not\u2014 I had one guy ask about just pulling out. And if they are truly concerned about pregnancies & birthcontol is something that they legitimately need for their sb to be on, then they will typically want to discuss that more. So yes, it works. It shuts down the no-condom assumptions just b/c I\u2019m on bc before they even have them.",

Not all men rape you in an alleyway either, does that mean women should walk home alone at 2am totally unprotected and unaware of their surroundings?\n\nAnd again, are some men asking b/c they\u2019re concerned about pregnancy scares \u2014 sure. And again, as I\u2019ve mentioned *in my post & in comments*, they\u2019ll want to talk about it more if that\u2019s one of their legitimate concerns. But do an overwhelming amount of men conflate birth control with whether or not they need to wear condoms, and the answer is _overwhelmingly yes and this has been both my & other women\u2019s experiences and you can see that in the responses from other sbs in this thread alone._\n\nYou like to conveniently claim that this is simply anecdotal when it\u2019s not. It is in in fact something women experience very frequently from the time they become sexually active. Sexual coercion, from having sex before you\u2019re ready, to testing your boundaries, to trying to emotionally manipulate you or circumvent your boundaries around protection, are very much real. \n\nAnd simply b/c I have only been in the bowl for a few months does not mean I do not have experience with men or with dating. Truthfully, the biggest difference is that the bowl moves faster, it\u2019s more honest to an extent, & people are more clear about their needs and expectations. Other than that, the very beginning is not too different, esp when screening for red flags and shitty behavior. \n\nBut sure, let\u2019s hope young new SBs who are often more prone to manipulation listen to SDs who quickly get offended by any post criticizing men & advocating for women & who have incentive to mislead SBs, rather than listening to other women. That 100% makes perfect sense here. Like you are legit arguing against a woman clearly stating she wants condoms, *which is a form of birth control so it\u2019s not even inaccurate*, because you don\u2019t like... the approach? Because she\u2019s not being polite & apologetic enough when she does it? Because she\u2019s not disclosing she\u2019s on a second birth control method? Because you don\u2019t appreciate that the opportunity to manipulate her has been shut down before you even have the chance? Because that\u2019s what it seems like bruh. You literally have zero experience on the woman\u2019s end and while, boohoo you deal with scammers who are trying to take your money, some of which are actually men w/fake profiles, women have to deal w/a type of scammer who will quite literally put our health & safety & lives at risk if we put our guards down. You dealing w/girls trying to get you to subscribe to their onlyfans is not in anyway the same as protecting my health & safety, and if this wasn\u2019t a _constant_ pattern that I have run up against time & again, I wouldn\u2019t post about it.",

What I have a problem with is you dodging the question because you assume the worst of any that asks it, and suggest that others take on the same ridiculous assumption.

If I asked if you were on BC and you ignored it and just said always condoms, I would assume you were illiterate, idiotic, or were hoping down the road for a broken condom to give me the most costly STD of all, pregnancy.\n\nThe only reason I responded to your post is because I THINK YOUR ADVICE IS NOT GOOD.  Not that women shouldn't be direct, and not that you shouldn't clearly state your preference for condoms.  I know you ar avoiding this clear point since, again, it invalidates your post.

PUAs, or men seeking to not use condoms, are not going to be dissuaded by you ignoring the question of whether you are or are not on BC.  You are going to have to stand tall and state that you are/are not on BC and expect to always use condoms regardless of your answer because that is your personal preference.  Anything else is kicking the conversation down the road where it might be harder or more uncomfortable to deal with.\n\nI always bring up exchanging STD results first, and start the discussion about current and future sexual partners.  Does that mean that all women are abandoning their responsibility to broach that conversation first?  No, unlike you I choose not to generalize an entire gender based on my experiences.\n\nAny references to your maturity have to do with your primary suggestion for avoidance, a common immature response to hard conversations, and your decision to jump to personal attacks when your statements are questioned rather than attempting to supplement your opinion with facts or additional information.  The fact that you've been in the bowl for only a few months and feel that you have the depth of knowledge to make such suggestions also speaks to a certain level of immaturity.",

There are plenty of men who will try manipulative boundary-testing, pickup-artistry, emotional guilt tripping, & pressuring type tactics but aren\u2019t full blown PUAs. Many people will simply try just to try. So sure, maybe this won\u2019t work on full blown PUAs\u2014 but the dudes who try just to test your boundaries to see what they can get away with? Clearly hasn\u2019t been so bad so far if I\u2019m preferring to stick to this rather than deal this these constant convos defending why I use condoms.\n\nMe responding to the birth control question this way actually works very great for me, & it is not out of \u201cavoidance\u201d of a \u201chard conversation,\u201d and what\u2019s truly ironic is you claiming that *I\u2019m* avoiding the conversation when many of these men often ask about BC and will try to assume BC = no protection solely so they themselves can avoid a conversation about protection. *I don\u2019t even lie & say I\u2019m not on birth control.* My suggestion is to cut through the bullshit & very bluntly say you require condoms when asked, and to shut down a very common manipulative tactic to get past your boundaries & requirement for protection. I see no need to defend my decision to use condoms or to even entertain the discussion before anything has been established. Responding to the question this way establishes my boundaries very quickly, and I have not had to deal w/anywhere near the same amount of emotional guilt tripping that I used to get when I say that I am on birth control but still want to use condoms. I establish very early on that condoms are expected & don\u2019t leave any wiggle room, and again, I see no problems with this. Is it absolutely full-proof? Of course not\u2014 I had one guy ask about just pulling out. And if they are truly concerned about pregnancies & birthcontol is something that they legitimately need for their sb to be on, then they will typically want to discuss that more. So yes, it works. It shuts down the no-condom assumptions just b/c I\u2019m on bc before they even have them.",

Not all men rape you in an alleyway either, does that mean women should walk home alone at 2am totally unprotected and unaware of their surroundings?\n\nAnd again, are some men asking b/c they\u2019re concerned about pregnancy scares \u2014 sure. And again, as I\u2019ve mentioned *in my post & in comments*, they\u2019ll want to talk about it more if that\u2019s one of their legitimate concerns. But do an overwhelming amount of men conflate birth control with whether or not they need to wear condoms, and the answer is _overwhelmingly yes and this has been both my & other women\u2019s experiences and you can see that in the responses from other sbs in this thread alone._\n\nYou like to conveniently claim that this is simply anecdotal when it\u2019s not. It is in in fact something women experience very frequently from the time they become sexually active. Sexual coercion, from having sex before you\u2019re ready, to testing your boundaries, to trying to emotionally manipulate you or circumvent your boundaries around protection, are very much real. \n\nAnd simply b/c I have only been in the bowl for a few months does not mean I do not have experience with men or with dating. Truthfully, the biggest difference is that the bowl moves faster, it\u2019s more honest to an extent, & people are more clear about their needs and expectations. Other than that, the very beginning is not too different, esp when screening for red flags and shitty behavior. \n\nBut sure, let\u2019s hope young new SBs who are often more prone to manipulation listen to SDs who quickly get offended by any post criticizing men & advocating for women & who have incentive to mislead SBs, rather than listening to other women. That 100% makes perfect sense here. Like you are legit arguing against a woman clearly stating she wants condoms, *which is a form of birth control so it\u2019s not even inaccurate*, because you don\u2019t like... the approach? Because she\u2019s not being polite & apologetic enough when she does it? Because she\u2019s not disclosing she\u2019s on a second birth control method? Because you don\u2019t appreciate that the opportunity to manipulate her has been shut down before you even have the chance? Because that\u2019s what it seems like bruh. You literally have zero experience on the woman\u2019s end and while, boohoo you deal with scammers who are trying to take your money, some of which are actually men w/fake profiles, women have to deal w/a type of scammer who will quite literally put our health & safety & lives at risk if we put our guards down. You dealing w/girls trying to get you to subscribe to their onlyfans is not in anyway the same as protecting my health & safety, and if this wasn\u2019t a _constant_ pattern that I have run up against time & again, I wouldn\u2019t post about it.",

What I have a problem with is you dodging the question because you assume the worst of any that asks it, and suggest that others take on the same ridiculous assumption.  As I stated previously, not only is it founded only on your experience (there are as many comments with conflicting view points to yours as there are SBs backing up your statement), but it doesn't solve the problem!  If I asked if you were on BC and you ignored it and just said always condoms, I would assume you were illiterate, idiotic, or were hoping down the road for a broken condom to give me the most costly STD of all, pregnancy.\n\nThe only reason I responded to your post is because I THINK YOUR ADVICE IS NOT GOOD.  Not that women shouldn't be direct, and not that you shouldn't clearly state your preference for condoms.  I know you ar avoiding this clear point since, again, it invalidates your post.

PUAs, or men seeking to not use condoms, are not going to be dissuaded by you ignoring the question of whether you are or are not on BC.  You are going to have to stand tall and state that you are/are not on BC and expect to always use condoms regardless of your answer because that is your personal preference.  Anything else is kicking the conversation down the road where it might be harder or more uncomfortable to deal with.\n\nI always bring up exchanging STD results first, and start the discussion about current and future sexual partners.  Does that mean that all women are abandoning their responsibility to broach that conversation first?  No, unlike you I choose not to generalize an entire gender based on my experiences.\n\nAny references to your maturity have to do with your primary suggestion for avoidance, a common immature response to hard conversations, and your decision to jump to personal attacks when your statements are questioned rather than attempting to supplement your opinion with facts or additional information.  The fact that you've been in the bowl for only a few months and feel that you have the depth of knowledge to make such suggestions also speaks to a certain level of immaturity.",

There are plenty of men who will try manipulative boundary-testing, pickup-artistry, emotional guilt tripping, & pressuring type tactics but aren\u2019t full blown PUAs. Many people will simply try just to try. So sure, maybe this won\u2019t work on full blown PUAs\u2014 but the dudes who try just to test your boundaries to see what they can get away with? Clearly hasn\u2019t been so bad so far if I\u2019m preferring to stick to this rather than deal this these constant convos defending why I use condoms.\n\nMe responding to the birth control question this way actually works very great for me, & it is not out of \u201cavoidance\u201d of a \u201chard conversation,\u201d and what\u2019s truly ironic is you claiming that *I\u2019m* avoiding the conversation when many of these men often ask about BC and will try to assume BC = no protection solely so they themselves can avoid a conversation about protection. *I don\u2019t even lie & say I\u2019m not on birth control.* My suggestion is to cut through the bullshit & very bluntly say you require condoms when asked, and to shut down a very common manipulative tactic to get past your boundaries & requirement for protection. I see no need to defend my decision to use condoms or to even entertain the discussion before anything has been established. Responding to the question this way establishes my boundaries very quickly, and I have not had to deal w/anywhere near the same amount of emotional guilt tripping that I used to get when I say that I am on birth control but still want to use condoms. I establish very early on that condoms are expected & don\u2019t leave any wiggle room, and again, I see no problems with this. Is it absolutely full-proof? Of course not\u2014 I had one guy ask about just pulling out. And if they are truly concerned about pregnancies & birthcontol is something that they legitimately need for their sb to be on, then they will typically want to discuss that more. So yes, it works. It shuts down the no-condom assumptions just b/c I\u2019m on bc before they even have them.",

For being in the bowl such a short time your perception of men and SDs in general is incredibly bitter and jaded, that's not a good sign.\n\nDo I deal with scammers and people with bad intentions when I am searching for a new SB?  Of course I do.  What I don't do is develop tactics based on the actions of the bad actors and apply it universally to everyone I encounter.  Better screening can help you avoid these people faster and faster as you get more experience.\n\nYou can go on shouting condoms for life until you are blue in the face.

Not all men rape you in an alleyway either, does that mean women should walk home alone at 2am totally unprotected and unaware of their surroundings?\n\nAnd again, are some men asking b/c they\u2019re concerned about pregnancy scares \u2014 sure. And again, as I\u2019ve mentioned *in my post & in comments*, they\u2019ll want to talk about it more if that\u2019s one of their legitimate concerns. But do an overwhelming amount of men conflate birth control with whether or not they need to wear condoms, and the answer is _overwhelmingly yes and this has been both my & other women\u2019s experiences and you can see that in the responses from other sbs in this thread alone._\n\nYou like to conveniently claim that this is simply anecdotal when it\u2019s not. It is in in fact something women experience very frequently from the time they become sexually active. Sexual coercion, from having sex before you\u2019re ready, to testing your boundaries, to trying to emotionally manipulate you or circumvent your boundaries around protection, are very much real. \n\nAnd simply b/c I have only been in the bowl for a few months does not mean I do not have experience with men or with dating. Truthfully, the biggest difference is that the bowl moves faster, it\u2019s more honest to an extent, & people are more clear about their needs and expectations. Other than that, the very beginning is not too different, esp when screening for red flags and shitty behavior. \n\nBut sure, let\u2019s hope young new SBs who are often more prone to manipulation listen to SDs who quickly get offended by any post criticizing men & advocating for women & who have incentive to mislead SBs, rather than listening to other women. That 100% makes perfect sense here. Like you are legit arguing against a woman clearly stating she wants condoms, *which is a form of birth control so it\u2019s not even inaccurate*, because you don\u2019t like... the approach? Because she\u2019s not being polite & apologetic enough when she does it? Because she\u2019s not disclosing she\u2019s on a second birth control method? Because you don\u2019t appreciate that the opportunity to manipulate her has been shut down before you even have the chance? Because that\u2019s what it seems like bruh. You literally have zero experience on the woman\u2019s end and while, boohoo you deal with scammers who are trying to take your money, some of which are actually men w/fake profiles, women have to deal w/a type of scammer who will quite literally put our health & safety & lives at risk if we put our guards down. You dealing w/girls trying to get you to subscribe to their onlyfans is not in anyway the same as protecting my health & safety, and if this wasn\u2019t a _constant_ pattern that I have run up against time & again, I wouldn\u2019t post about it.",

I'll respond to the few parts worth mentioning.\n\nI don't have a problem with a women being direct, in fact if your genius suggestion was to clearly state that you are/are not on BC but will always require condoms then I wouldn't have even responded to your post.  What I have a problem with is you dodging the question because you assume the worst of any that asks it, and suggest that others take on the same ridiculous assumption.  As I stated previously, not only is it founded only on your experience (there are as many comments with conflicting view points to yours as there are SBs backing up your statement), but it doesn't solve the problem!  If I asked if you were on BC and you ignored it and just said always condoms, I would assume you were illiterate, idiotic, or were hoping down the road for a broken condom to give me the most costly STD of all, pregnancy.\n\nThe only reason I responded to your post is because I THINK YOUR ADVICE IS NOT GOOD.  Not that women shouldn't be direct, and not that you shouldn't clearly state your preference for condoms.  I know you ar avoiding this clear point since, again, it invalidates your post.  Unlike you, I'll refrain from making assumptions about your character or the reason you made the post in the first place and merely let your flawed argument stand for itself.",

Clearly hasn\u2019t been so bad so far if I\u2019m preferring to stick to this rather than deal this these constant convos defending why I use condoms.\n\nMe responding to the birth control question this way actually works very great for me, & it is not out of \u201cavoidance\u201d of a \u201chard conversation,\u201d and what\u2019s truly ironic is you claiming that *I\u2019m* avoiding the conversation when many of these men often ask about BC and will try to assume BC = no protection solely so they themselves can avoid a conversation about protection. *I don\u2019t even lie & say I\u2019m not on birth control.* My suggestion is to cut through the bullshit & very bluntly say you require condoms when asked, and to shut down a very common manipulative tactic to get past your boundaries & requirement for protection. I see no need to defend my decision to use condoms or to even entertain the discussion before anything has been established. Responding to the question this way establishes my boundaries very quickly, and I have not had to deal w/anywhere near the same amount of emotional guilt tripping that I used to get when I say that I am on birth control but still want to use condoms. I establish very early on that condoms are expected & don\u2019t leave any wiggle room, and again, I see no problems with this. Is it absolutely full-proof? Of course not\u2014 I had one guy ask about just pulling out. And if they are truly concerned about pregnancies & birthcontol is something that they legitimately need for their sb to be on, then they will typically want to discuss that more. So yes, it works. It shuts down the no-condom assumptions just b/c I\u2019m on bc before they even have them.",

I almost gave up bothering to reply, I wonder if that was your aim all along.  I'll respond to the few parts worth mentioning.\n\nI don't have a problem with a women being direct, in fact if your genius suggestion was to clearly state that you are/are not on BC but will always require condoms then I wouldn't have even responded to your post.  What I have a problem with is you dodging the question because you assume the worst of any that asks it, and suggest that others take on the same ridiculous assumption.  As I stated previously, not only is it founded only on your experience (there are as many comments with conflicting view points to yours as there are SBs backing up your statement), but it doesn't solve the problem!  If I asked if you were on BC and you ignored it and just said always condoms, I would assume you were illiterate, idiotic, or were hoping down the road for a broken condom to give me the most costly STD of all, pregnancy.\n\nThe only reason I responded to your post is because I THINK YOUR ADVICE IS NOT GOOD.  Not that women shouldn't be direct, and not that you shouldn't clearly state your preference for condoms.  I know you ar avoiding this clear point since, again, it invalidates your post.  Unlike you, I'll refrain from making assumptions about your character or the reason you made the post in the first place and merely let your flawed argument stand for itself.",
