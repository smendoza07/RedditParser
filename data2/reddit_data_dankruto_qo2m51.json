But, as Hashirama points out, whatever other Uchiha shinobi might have done in that war, this particular Uchiha had no part in it. \n\nOf course, Sasuke didn't consider himself to be an innocent child; he had his own conflicts with the Leaf. But Hashirama and Tobirama wouldn't and couldn't have known about the Uchiha Massacre or the treatment of Itachi since both of those events occurred after their deaths.",

They'd spend all of their time trying to form an anti-leaf alliance, and we'd see tailed-beast sabotage, like Orochimaru pulled with the 3 and 8 tails, even more often than we did in the series. \n\nHashirama wanted to organize cooperation agreements with the other villages much like he organized agreements between the clans within the Leaf. But it took ages for most of the clans to trust the Senju enough to agree to peace, and Hashirama wanted to speed things up. To accomplish this, he made a show of good faith; he willingly gifted the beasts to foster trust and to create an illusion of mutually assured destruction. I say illusion because he still kept the strongest tailed beast for the Leaf, but the other villages each got at least one. \n\nAnd it's true that this gesture from Hashirama didn't pan out, but most of the problems came from Madara and the first Kazekage. The Kazekage was a greedy bastard and would not agree to cooperate and compromise in good faith. But that wouldn't have been enough to tank peace if the other villages could form a cooperation agreement that could oppose the Kazekage. But Madara was too proud to compromise with weaker forces, and he sabotaged the deals that Hashirama was able to make with the other villages (like we see in Onoki's flashback).",

Even with Boruto, Naruto, this fucking god of Shinobi, only extends peace long enough for his son to reach maturity. \n\nHashirama was the first person to form a hidden village and word got out quickly, but hidden villages were still in their infancy. Before the formation of such villages, Shinobi clans that have secret techniques or strong genetic advantages would act as mercenaries for the countries that predated the villages, since someone from these clans would have greater military aptitude than the average civilian.\n\nHired by civilian villages or the governments of the countries, these Shinobi clans would battle to settle any dispute, for the most part. Shinobi were diverse so it's likely many clans had moral codes that would lead to the refusal of missions.\n\nThe Uchiha and Senju were both such clans, the Uchiha being descendants of Indra Otsutsuki with the genetic Sharingan, extremely useful for its genjutsu (at a basic level). The Senju being descendants of Ashura Otsutsuki with great vitality, strength, speed and chakra reserves.\n\nThe Senju and the Uchiha were famed as the strongest out of all of these clans during the warring states period. Due to this, when one side hired one clan, the other side would hire the other clan. This lead to many conflicts between the two clans and resulted in resentment and hatred, since every Uchiha has lost a family member to the Senju and every Senju has lost a family member to the Uchiha.\n\nHashirama and Madara were the strongest ninja of their time. They founded a village together and got the backing of the fire nation, the most powerful and tactically placed nation. This village is already extremely powerful, has the best possible strategic placement and on top of that now has the power of tailed beasts.\n\nThe leaf village was primarily founded from Hashirama's will, a place for Shinobi from different clans to work, train and live together. A village where there is no unnecessary killing and any Shinobi would have a much better chance of survival and (hopefully, didn't end up that way) no children would have to fight on the front lines. We see this later through policies like 3 ninja teams and medical ninja. They were still mercenaries, the world wasn't perfect and people still needed mercenaries.\n\nSome of the other villages shared somewhat of a similar will of fire, but many did not and were brutal. The primary reason for the formation of the other villages was that the other countries and the other clans knew that the fire nation and leaf village, respectively, had much more power than any individual nation or single clan, so they tried to replicate it, as superficially as possible.\n\nDuring the first kage summit, we see one kage come to the table with what is seen as unreasonable demands. In terms of co-operation and peace these were unreasonable, but that's not what the kage wanted, he wanted power. The other kage are afraid, they desire power so that they are less afraid, Hashirama recognises this and distributed the tailed beasts. While there is still an imbalance of power, it was not not easy to destroy any village, since you'd have to take on a tailed beast.\n\nEven with this, the villages still go to war shortly after, then continue to go to war. Every time over disputes between villages about power, even the fucking fourth one. If Hashirama hadn't distributed the tailed beasts, the hidden leaf village would be constantly under attack and at a war of attrition.\n\nOut of fear of being destroyed at any moment, the other villages would constantly be trying to steal and use the tailed beasts against the leaf. The other villages would constantly use Guerilla tactics and would likely target leaf children since they're weaker. Every hokage at constant risk of assassination, the same for every single leaf ninja. Hashirama did the right thing.",

He was kidnapping and experimenting on people, he was following no moral code, he went mad with power after losing his parents and not having any other real connections.

He joined Orochimaru despite knowing that Orochimaru was the person behind the death of the Third Hokage. He tried to kill Naruto and Sakura plenty of times, he killed many innocent samurais who were just doing their duty, he tried to captured Bee and then at the end he was willing to kill every single Hokage too. How can you call this guy a hero? He was a person who just needed help and needed someone to save him from his hatred before he got completely consumed by it. He wasnt a hero for sure. Also, I agree that the Raikage is an asshole but in this situation, he was the right one. Why wouldnt he not go for Sasuke's head knowing that Sasuke tried to kidnap Bee.",

The was guy outright evil. I can even argue that he was more evil than Madara or Obito. At least these guys knew on some level that they are f'd up. Danzo was a self righteous prick who thought too high about himself and was totally blind to the shit he caused. If they made Itachi a Hokage the revolt wouldn\u2019t have happened at all because with his brains Itachi would make Konoha #1 village. But Danzo was afraid that he would lose power. \nMadara and Obito are more sympathetic to me, because even though they are bad, they were made this way. Madara was twisted by the horrors of war and his little brother\u2019s death, and Obito was twisted by Madara. \nDanzo was twisted by his own greed for power. \n\nSo thumbs up to Sasuke for killing this scumbag.\n\nAs for Deidara and some no name samurai, well, who cares. Deidara was a terrorist anyway and he almost levelled the whole Hidden Sand, so that\u2019s a plus for Sasuke as well. \nSamurai just bit more than they could chew. What were they thinking when they attacked Sasuke? That he will _boink_ them on the head with a twig like Tobi? They got what they asked for basically. Remember Sasuke was outright mad after he learned the truth about his loving, caring, and basically saint elder brother. I would be mad too in this situation. \n\nI know I sound like Sasutard, but my points are valid. \n\nAnd I'm kind of on Raikage's side when he battled Sasuke, imagine if Itachi knew that Sasuke was kidnapped. Same thing here. That\u2019s what made this arc so awesome, it was really hard to pick sides. \nA reminder what a shitshow Boruto is.",

But, as Hashirama points out, whatever other Uchiha shinobi might have done in that war, this particular Uchiha had no part in it. \n\nOf course, Sasuke didn't consider himself to be an innocent child; he had his own conflicts with the Leaf.

They'd spend all of their time trying to form an anti-leaf alliance, and we'd see tailed-beast sabotage, like Orochimaru pulled with the 3 and 8 tails, even more often than we did in the series. \n\nHashirama wanted to organize cooperation agreements with the other villages much like he organized agreements between the clans within the Leaf. But it took ages for most of the clans to trust the Senju enough to agree to peace, and Hashirama wanted to speed things up. To accomplish this, he made a show of good faith; he willingly gifted the beasts to foster trust and to create an illusion of mutually assured destruction. I say illusion because he still kept the strongest tailed beast for the Leaf, but the other villages each got at least one. \n\nAnd it's true that this gesture from Hashirama didn't pan out, but most of the problems came from Madara and the first Kazekage. The Kazekage was a greedy bastard and would not agree to cooperate and compromise in good faith. But that wouldn't have been enough to tank peace if the other villages could form a cooperation agreement that could oppose the Kazekage. But Madara was too proud to compromise with weaker forces, and he sabotaged the deals that Hashirama was able to make with the other villages (like we see in Onoki's flashback).",

Even with Boruto, Naruto, this fucking god of Shinobi, only extends peace long enough for his son to reach maturity. \n\nHashirama was the first person to form a hidden village and word got out quickly, but hidden villages were still in their infancy. Before the formation of such villages, Shinobi clans that have secret techniques or strong genetic advantages would act as mercenaries for the countries that predated the villages, since someone from these clans would have greater military aptitude than the average civilian.\n\nHired by civilian villages or the governments of the countries, these Shinobi clans would battle to settle any dispute, for the most part. Shinobi were diverse so it's likely many clans had moral codes that would lead to the refusal of missions.\n\nThe Uchiha and Senju were both such clans, the Uchiha being descendants of Indra Otsutsuki with the genetic Sharingan, extremely useful for its genjutsu (at a basic level). The Senju being descendants of Ashura Otsutsuki with great vitality, strength, speed and chakra reserves.\n\nThe Senju and the Uchiha were famed as the strongest out of all of these clans during the warring states period. Due to this, when one side hired one clan, the other side would hire the other clan. This lead to many conflicts between the two clans and resulted in resentment and hatred, since every Uchiha has lost a family member to the Senju and every Senju has lost a family member to the Uchiha.\n\nHashirama and Madara were the strongest ninja of their time. They founded a village together and got the backing of the fire nation, the most powerful and tactically placed nation. This village is already extremely powerful, has the best possible strategic placement and on top of that now has the power of tailed beasts.\n\nThe leaf village was primarily founded from Hashirama's will, a place for Shinobi from different clans to work, train and live together. A village where there is no unnecessary killing and any Shinobi would have a much better chance of survival and (hopefully, didn't end up that way) no children would have to fight on the front lines. We see this later through policies like 3 ninja teams and medical ninja. They were still mercenaries, the world wasn't perfect and people still needed mercenaries.\n\nSome of the other villages shared somewhat of a similar will of fire, but many did not and were brutal. The primary reason for the formation of the other villages was that the other countries and the other clans knew that the fire nation and leaf village, respectively, had much more power than any individual nation or single clan, so they tried to replicate it, as superficially as possible.\n\nDuring the first kage summit, we see one kage come to the table with what is seen as unreasonable demands. In terms of co-operation and peace these were unreasonable, but that's not what the kage wanted, he wanted power. The other kage are afraid, they desire power so that they are less afraid, Hashirama recognises this and distributed the tailed beasts. While there is still an imbalance of power, it was not not easy to destroy any village, since you'd have to take on a tailed beast.\n\nEven with this, the villages still go to war shortly after, then continue to go to war. Every time over disputes between villages about power, even the fucking fourth one. If Hashirama hadn't distributed the tailed beasts, the hidden leaf village would be constantly under attack and at a war of attrition.\n\nOut of fear of being destroyed at any moment, the other villages would constantly be trying to steal and use the tailed beasts against the leaf. The other villages would constantly use Guerilla tactics and would likely target leaf children since they're weaker. Every hokage at constant risk of assassination, the same for every single leaf ninja. Hashirama did the right thing.",

Ideal as an ally, but better to be neutral than an enemy.\n\nOrochiamaru was different, he was kicked out of the village only due to Hiruzen's weakness. He was kidnapping and experimenting on people, he was following no moral code, he went mad with power after losing his parents and not having any other real connections. Even after leaving the leaf, he still is kidnapping and killing people rather indiscriminately.",

He joined Orochimaru despite knowing that Orochimaru was the person behind the death of the Third Hokage. He tried to kill Naruto and Sakura plenty of times, he killed many innocent samurais who were just doing their duty, he tried to captured Bee and then at the end he was willing to kill every single Hokage too. How can you call this guy a hero? He was a person who just needed help and needed someone to save him from his hatred before he got completely consumed by it. He wasnt a hero for sure. Also, I agree that the Raikage is an asshole but in this situation, he was the right one. Why wouldnt he not go for Sasuke's head knowing that Sasuke tried to kidnap Bee.",

But, as Hashirama points out, whatever other Uchiha shinobi might have done in that war, this particular Uchiha had no part in it. \n\nOf course, Sasuke didn't consider himself to be an innocent child; he had his own conflicts with the Leaf.

They'd spend all of their time trying to form an anti-leaf alliance, and we'd see tailed-beast sabotage, like Orochimaru pulled with the 3 and 8 tails, even more often than we did in the series. \n\nHashirama wanted to organize cooperation agreements with the other villages much like he organized agreements between the clans within the Leaf. But it took ages for most of the clans to trust the Senju enough to agree to peace, and Hashirama wanted to speed things up. To accomplish this, he made a show of good faith; he willingly gifted the beasts to foster trust and to create an illusion of mutually assured destruction. I say illusion because he still kept the strongest tailed beast for the Leaf, but the other villages each got at least one. \n\nAnd it's true that this gesture from Hashirama didn't pan out, but most of the problems came from Madara and the first Kazekage. The Kazekage was a greedy bastard and would not agree to cooperate and compromise in good faith. But that wouldn't have been enough to tank peace if the other villages could form a cooperation agreement that could oppose the Kazekage. But Madara was too proud to compromise with weaker forces, and he sabotaged the deals that Hashirama was able to make with the other villages (like we see in Onoki's flashback).",

                                    "body": "Very nice comment. I feel like people forget how short and brutal the timeline of Naruto is. Even with Boruto, Naruto, this fucking god of Shinobi, only extends peace long enough for his son to reach maturity. \n\nHashirama was the first person to form a hidden village and word got out quickly, but hidden villages were still in their infancy. Before the formation of such villages, Shinobi clans that have secret techniques or strong genetic advantages would act as mercenaries for the countries that predated the villages, since someone from these clans would have greater military aptitude than the average civilian.\n\nHired by civilian villages or the governments of the countries, these Shinobi clans would battle to settle any dispute, for the most part. Shinobi were diverse so it's likely many clans had moral codes that would lead to the refusal of missions.\n\nThe Uchiha and Senju were both such clans, the Uchiha being descendants of Indra Otsutsuki with the genetic Sharingan, extremely useful for its genjutsu (at a basic level). The Senju being descendants of Ashura Otsutsuki with great vitality, strength, speed and chakra reserves.\n\nThe Senju and the Uchiha were famed as the strongest out of all of these clans during the warring states period. Due to this, when one side hired one clan, the other side would hire the other clan. This lead to many conflicts between the two clans and resulted in resentment and hatred, since every Uchiha has lost a family member to the Senju and every Senju has lost a family member to the Uchiha.\n\nHashirama and Madara were the strongest ninja of their time. They founded a village together and got the backing of the fire nation, the most powerful and tactically placed nation. This village is already extremely powerful, has the best possible strategic placement and on top of that now has the power of tailed beasts.\n\nThe leaf village was primarily founded from Hashirama's will, a place for Shinobi from different clans to work, train and live together. A village where there is no unnecessary killing and any Shinobi would have a much better chance of survival and (hopefully, didn't end up that way) no children would have to fight on the front lines. We see this later through policies like 3 ninja teams and medical ninja. They were still mercenaries, the world wasn't perfect and people still needed mercenaries.\n\nSome of the other villages shared somewhat of a similar will of fire, but many did not and were brutal. The primary reason for the formation of the other villages was that the other countries and the other clans knew that the fire nation and leaf village, respectively, had much more power than any individual nation or single clan, so they tried to replicate it, as superficially as possible.\n\nDuring the first kage summit, we see one kage come to the table with what is seen as unreasonable demands. In terms of co-operation and peace these were unreasonable, but that's not what the kage wanted, he wanted power. The other kage are afraid, they desire power so that they are less afraid, Hashirama recognises this and distributed the tailed beasts. While there is still an imbalance of power, it was not not easy to destroy any village, since you'd have to take on a tailed beast.\n\nEven with this, the villages still go to war shortly after, then continue to go to war. Every time over disputes between villages about power, even the fucking fourth one. If Hashirama hadn't distributed the tailed beasts, the hidden leaf village would be constantly under attack and at a war of attrition.\n\nOut of fear of being destroyed at any moment, the other villages would constantly be trying to steal and use the tailed beasts against the leaf. The other villages would constantly use Guerilla tactics and would likely target leaf children since they're weaker. Every hokage at constant risk of assassination, the same for every single leaf ninja. Hashirama did the right thing.",

Ideal as an ally, but better to be neutral than an enemy.\n\nOrochiamaru was different, he was kicked out of the village only due to Hiruzen's weakness. He was kidnapping and experimenting on people, he was following no moral code, he went mad with power after losing his parents and not having any other real connections. Even after leaving the leaf, he still is kidnapping and killing people rather indiscriminately.",

They'd spend all of their time trying to form an anti-leaf alliance, and we'd see tailed-beast sabotage, like Orochimaru pulled with the 3 and 8 tails, even more often than we did in the series. \n\nHashirama wanted to organize cooperation agreements with the other villages much like he organized agreements between the clans within the Leaf. But it took ages for most of the clans to trust the Senju enough to agree to peace, and Hashirama wanted to speed things up. To accomplish this, he made a show of good faith; he willingly gifted the beasts to foster trust and to create an illusion of mutually assured destruction. I say illusion because he still kept the strongest tailed beast for the Leaf, but the other villages each got at least one. \n\nAnd it's true that this gesture from Hashirama didn't pan out, but most of the problems came from Madara and the first Kazekage. The Kazekage was a greedy bastard and would not agree to cooperate and compromise in good faith. But that wouldn't have been enough to tank peace if the other villages could form a cooperation agreement that could oppose the Kazekage. But Madara was too proud to compromise with weaker forces, and he sabotaged the deals that Hashirama was able to make with the other villages (like we see in Onoki's flashback).",

                            "body": "Very nice comment. I feel like people forget how short and brutal the timeline of Naruto is. Even with Boruto, Naruto, this fucking god of Shinobi, only extends peace long enough for his son to reach maturity. \n\nHashirama was the first person to form a hidden village and word got out quickly, but hidden villages were still in their infancy. Before the formation of such villages, Shinobi clans that have secret techniques or strong genetic advantages would act as mercenaries for the countries that predated the villages, since someone from these clans would have greater military aptitude than the average civilian.\n\nHired by civilian villages or the governments of the countries, these Shinobi clans would battle to settle any dispute, for the most part. Shinobi were diverse so it's likely many clans had moral codes that would lead to the refusal of missions.\n\nThe Uchiha and Senju were both such clans, the Uchiha being descendants of Indra Otsutsuki with the genetic Sharingan, extremely useful for its genjutsu (at a basic level). The Senju being descendants of Ashura Otsutsuki with great vitality, strength, speed and chakra reserves.\n\nThe Senju and the Uchiha were famed as the strongest out of all of these clans during the warring states period. Due to this, when one side hired one clan, the other side would hire the other clan. This lead to many conflicts between the two clans and resulted in resentment and hatred, since every Uchiha has lost a family member to the Senju and every Senju has lost a family member to the Uchiha.\n\nHashirama and Madara were the strongest ninja of their time. They founded a village together and got the backing of the fire nation, the most powerful and tactically placed nation. This village is already extremely powerful, has the best possible strategic placement and on top of that now has the power of tailed beasts.\n\nThe leaf village was primarily founded from Hashirama's will, a place for Shinobi from different clans to work, train and live together. A village where there is no unnecessary killing and any Shinobi would have a much better chance of survival and (hopefully, didn't end up that way) no children would have to fight on the front lines. We see this later through policies like 3 ninja teams and medical ninja. They were still mercenaries, the world wasn't perfect and people still needed mercenaries.\n\nSome of the other villages shared somewhat of a similar will of fire, but many did not and were brutal. The primary reason for the formation of the other villages was that the other countries and the other clans knew that the fire nation and leaf village, respectively, had much more power than any individual nation or single clan, so they tried to replicate it, as superficially as possible.\n\nDuring the first kage summit, we see one kage come to the table with what is seen as unreasonable demands. In terms of co-operation and peace these were unreasonable, but that's not what the kage wanted, he wanted power. The other kage are afraid, they desire power so that they are less afraid, Hashirama recognises this and distributed the tailed beasts. While there is still an imbalance of power, it was not not easy to destroy any village, since you'd have to take on a tailed beast.\n\nEven with this, the villages still go to war shortly after, then continue to go to war. Every time over disputes between villages about power, even the fucking fourth one. If Hashirama hadn't distributed the tailed beasts, the hidden leaf village would be constantly under attack and at a war of attrition.\n\nOut of fear of being destroyed at any moment, the other villages would constantly be trying to steal and use the tailed beasts against the leaf. The other villages would constantly use Guerilla tactics and would likely target leaf children since they're weaker. Every hokage at constant risk of assassination, the same for every single leaf ninja. Hashirama did the right thing.",

Ideal as an ally, but better to be neutral than an enemy.\n\nOrochiamaru was different, he was kicked out of the village only due to Hiruzen's weakness. He was kidnapping and experimenting on people, he was following no moral code, he went mad with power after losing his parents and not having any other real connections. Even after leaving the leaf, he still is kidnapping and killing people rather indiscriminately.",

They'd spend all of their time trying to form an anti-leaf alliance, and we'd see tailed-beast sabotage, like Orochimaru pulled with the 3 and 8 tails, even more often than we did in the series. \n\nHashirama wanted to organize cooperation agreements with the other villages much like he organized agreements between the clans within the Leaf. But it took ages for most of the clans to trust the Senju enough to agree to peace, and Hashirama wanted to speed things up. To accomplish this, he made a show of good faith; he willingly gifted the beasts to foster trust and to create an illusion of mutually assured destruction. I say illusion because he still kept the strongest tailed beast for the Leaf, but the other villages each got at least one. \n\nAnd it's true that this gesture from Hashirama didn't pan out, but most of the problems came from Madara and the first Kazekage. The Kazekage was a greedy bastard and would not agree to cooperate and compromise in good faith. But that wouldn't have been enough to tank peace if the other villages could form a cooperation agreement that could oppose the Kazekage. But Madara was too proud to compromise with weaker forces, and he sabotaged the deals that Hashirama was able to make with the other villages (like we see in Onoki's flashback).",

                    "body": "Very nice comment. I feel like people forget how short and brutal the timeline of Naruto is. Even with Boruto, Naruto, this fucking god of Shinobi, only extends peace long enough for his son to reach maturity. \n\nHashirama was the first person to form a hidden village and word got out quickly, but hidden villages were still in their infancy. Before the formation of such villages, Shinobi clans that have secret techniques or strong genetic advantages would act as mercenaries for the countries that predated the villages, since someone from these clans would have greater military aptitude than the average civilian.\n\nHired by civilian villages or the governments of the countries, these Shinobi clans would battle to settle any dispute, for the most part. Shinobi were diverse so it's likely many clans had moral codes that would lead to the refusal of missions.\n\nThe Uchiha and Senju were both such clans, the Uchiha being descendants of Indra Otsutsuki with the genetic Sharingan, extremely useful for its genjutsu (at a basic level). The Senju being descendants of Ashura Otsutsuki with great vitality, strength, speed and chakra reserves.\n\nThe Senju and the Uchiha were famed as the strongest out of all of these clans during the warring states period. Due to this, when one side hired one clan, the other side would hire the other clan. This lead to many conflicts between the two clans and resulted in resentment and hatred, since every Uchiha has lost a family member to the Senju and every Senju has lost a family member to the Uchiha.\n\nHashirama and Madara were the strongest ninja of their time. They founded a village together and got the backing of the fire nation, the most powerful and tactically placed nation. This village is already extremely powerful, has the best possible strategic placement and on top of that now has the power of tailed beasts.\n\nThe leaf village was primarily founded from Hashirama's will, a place for Shinobi from different clans to work, train and live together. A village where there is no unnecessary killing and any Shinobi would have a much better chance of survival and (hopefully, didn't end up that way) no children would have to fight on the front lines. We see this later through policies like 3 ninja teams and medical ninja. They were still mercenaries, the world wasn't perfect and people still needed mercenaries.\n\nSome of the other villages shared somewhat of a similar will of fire, but many did not and were brutal. The primary reason for the formation of the other villages was that the other countries and the other clans knew that the fire nation and leaf village, respectively, had much more power than any individual nation or single clan, so they tried to replicate it, as superficially as possible.\n\nDuring the first kage summit, we see one kage come to the table with what is seen as unreasonable demands. In terms of co-operation and peace these were unreasonable, but that's not what the kage wanted, he wanted power. The other kage are afraid, they desire power so that they are less afraid, Hashirama recognises this and distributed the tailed beasts. While there is still an imbalance of power, it was not not easy to destroy any village, since you'd have to take on a tailed beast.\n\nEven with this, the villages still go to war shortly after, then continue to go to war. Every time over disputes between villages about power, even the fucking fourth one. If Hashirama hadn't distributed the tailed beasts, the hidden leaf village would be constantly under attack and at a war of attrition.\n\nOut of fear of being destroyed at any moment, the other villages would constantly be trying to steal and use the tailed beasts against the leaf. The other villages would constantly use Guerilla tactics and would likely target leaf children since they're weaker. Every hokage at constant risk of assassination, the same for every single leaf ninja. Hashirama did the right thing.",

Ideal as an ally, but better to be neutral than an enemy.\n\nOrochiamaru was different, he was kicked out of the village only due to Hiruzen's weakness. He was kidnapping and experimenting on people, he was following no moral code, he went mad with power after losing his parents and not having any other real connections. Even after leaving the leaf, he still is kidnapping and killing people rather indiscriminately.",

            "body": "Very nice comment. I feel like people forget how short and brutal the timeline of Naruto is. Even with Boruto, Naruto, this fucking god of Shinobi, only extends peace long enough for his son to reach maturity. \n\nHashirama was the first person to form a hidden village and word got out quickly, but hidden villages were still in their infancy. Before the formation of such villages, Shinobi clans that have secret techniques or strong genetic advantages would act as mercenaries for the countries that predated the villages, since someone from these clans would have greater military aptitude than the average civilian.\n\nHired by civilian villages or the governments of the countries, these Shinobi clans would battle to settle any dispute, for the most part. Shinobi were diverse so it's likely many clans had moral codes that would lead to the refusal of missions.\n\nThe Uchiha and Senju were both such clans, the Uchiha being descendants of Indra Otsutsuki with the genetic Sharingan, extremely useful for its genjutsu (at a basic level). The Senju being descendants of Ashura Otsutsuki with great vitality, strength, speed and chakra reserves.\n\nThe Senju and the Uchiha were famed as the strongest out of all of these clans during the warring states period. Due to this, when one side hired one clan, the other side would hire the other clan. This lead to many conflicts between the two clans and resulted in resentment and hatred, since every Uchiha has lost a family member to the Senju and every Senju has lost a family member to the Uchiha.\n\nHashirama and Madara were the strongest ninja of their time. They founded a village together and got the backing of the fire nation, the most powerful and tactically placed nation. This village is already extremely powerful, has the best possible strategic placement and on top of that now has the power of tailed beasts.\n\nThe leaf village was primarily founded from Hashirama's will, a place for Shinobi from different clans to work, train and live together. A village where there is no unnecessary killing and any Shinobi would have a much better chance of survival and (hopefully, didn't end up that way) no children would have to fight on the front lines. We see this later through policies like 3 ninja teams and medical ninja. They were still mercenaries, the world wasn't perfect and people still needed mercenaries.\n\nSome of the other villages shared somewhat of a similar will of fire, but many did not and were brutal. The primary reason for the formation of the other villages was that the other countries and the other clans knew that the fire nation and leaf village, respectively, had much more power than any individual nation or single clan, so they tried to replicate it, as superficially as possible.\n\nDuring the first kage summit, we see one kage come to the table with what is seen as unreasonable demands. In terms of co-operation and peace these were unreasonable, but that's not what the kage wanted, he wanted power. The other kage are afraid, they desire power so that they are less afraid, Hashirama recognises this and distributed the tailed beasts. While there is still an imbalance of power, it was not not easy to destroy any village, since you'd have to take on a tailed beast.\n\nEven with this, the villages still go to war shortly after, then continue to go to war. Every time over disputes between villages about power, even the fucking fourth one. If Hashirama hadn't distributed the tailed beasts, the hidden leaf village would be constantly under attack and at a war of attrition.\n\nOut of fear of being destroyed at any moment, the other villages would constantly be trying to steal and use the tailed beasts against the leaf. The other villages would constantly use Guerilla tactics and would likely target leaf children since they're weaker. Every hokage at constant risk of assassination, the same for every single leaf ninja. Hashirama did the right thing.",

Ideal as an ally, but better to be neutral than an enemy.\n\nOrochiamaru was different, he was kicked out of the village only due to Hiruzen's weakness. He was kidnapping and experimenting on people, he was following no moral code, he went mad with power after losing his parents and not having any other real connections. Even after leaving the leaf, he still is kidnapping and killing people rather indiscriminately.",

I don't think the leaf would put so many resources into tracking them down or even making them wanted as long as they were being affable and not antagonistic, since they're strong legendary sannin. Ideal as an ally, but better to be neutral than an enemy.\n\nOrochiamaru was different, he was kicked out of the village only due to Hiruzen's weakness. He was kidnapping and experimenting on people, he was following no moral code, he went mad with power after losing his parents and not having any other real connections. Even after leaving the leaf, he still is kidnapping and killing people rather indiscriminately.",
