    "body": "Hi SBs!\n\nEdit: SBs You are not a dance monkey auditioning for the circus! \nEdit 2: Drain the swamp! \n\nThere's a nasty trend I've noticed that I'm ready to see come to an end. Yes, yes we know how math, \"supply and demand\" work but SBs PLEASE remember you are not purely some \"commodity\" or a \"product on a shelf\". You are a person with values, feelings, morals, likes and dislikes, boundaries and comfort levels. \n\nDespite what many may say here the notion of having sex after 2-3 dates or by the first/second date is NOT A LEGIT RULE you must follow. You make the rules for what happens in your life and SR. Of course a SR should be reciprocal and fulfilling for both parties but always put your desires and needs first only then will you bring your best self to a SR. We are not desperate here. \n\nSRs and Escorts do not operate in the same way. Escorts are purely transactional and are even more strict and relentless with their value and desires than SBs. \n\nSRs offer companionship and romantic parts of a relationship (which may or not include sex) that are not charged by the hour but by the value each party sees in the relationship. \n\nMost SDs have greater respect for those who aren't overly self sacrificing anyway. Also, men DO like a teensie bit of chase but show interest as well. \n\nBelieve me I've been the \"pick me\"...it gets you sad and abandoned. We need to realize we bring more than just sex to the table. We bring our energy, youth, attention and our presence and even just being seen out in public with SDs will benefit him in a social setting. Businessmen may think \"oh it takes money to have a woman like that! I need to introduce myself to him, I may want to do business with him.\" Trophy wives and Arm Candy exist for a reason! It's a reflection of how successful the man is! \n\nSBs step into your power. Take a good look at how you would compliment a man's life... Are you multilingual? Are you creative and artsy? Are you a savvy business mind? Do you have amazing legs? Hazel eyes?\n\nPlease don't let these Splendas/Johns and wannabe SDs lowball you into settling into a transactional cheap experience. If you want a gift  on the first date, desire it! If not that's fine too. Those who aren't for you will move along! These SDs should be showing why they would be a good choice as well. Realize what you have and don't settle. It's all about mindset. \ud83d\ude18 I'll see you in the comments!\n\nSDs if you're mad about this you're part of the problem! Same message applies to trans and male SBs. We are the flowers and they are the Bees!",

They would be fools to expect honesty or loyalty from their SBs. Can't hold someone to a higher standard that you yourself don't measure up to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You trying to humble/shame/debunk me\n\nNot my intention.

If I\u2019m still very hesitant, I will politely redirect and wait on receiving that support. The other part I take issue with is suggesting that women who DO engage in intimacy faster is negatively impacting any of us who don\u2019t. Just like in regular dating, women are called all kinds of nasty things by people policing their virtue. Let\u2019s not judge anyone who WANTS to jump into bed right away. I see your intention is to encourage not to settle, but I wanted to clarify those points.",

Especially if you have children.  While you may be ok risking living on the street just for yourself, no sane parent is going to want to risk that for their children and they WILL \"lower their standards\" and accept what they can get because they HAVE to.  It is unfortunate, but it is just reality.  \n\nIn the sugar bowl this can get particularly stark - especially if what you call a \"splenda\" daddy offers money that is still ten times the wages a person could get with a legitimate job - one would be foolish to turn that down to hold out for making thirty times that \"and nothing less\" if eviction is days away.  \n\nIt seems rather obnoxious to tell someone who is about to be on the streets to turn down more money than they've ever been able to earn per hour in their life just for some \"principle\" that they should hold out for more.  Are you going to take them in when they have no place to live?  If not, you should not shame or judge them for doing what they need to do to get by.  Everyone in that situation has to make stark choices.",

We take different risks in the bowl. Yes, SDs have greater material means (that's the very basis of any SR) but our wealth makes us primary targets for fraud, blackmail, robbery, and theft. SBs are more prone to abuse or even violence. However, you have to see that it is not sugar-specific. Women in general are more prone to abuse and violence.",

I think a lot of points that you made directed at SBs could also be good advice for SDs. Ideally, its not just the SB who is bringing something valuable in to the arrangement, it is equally important for a SD to bring value to the arrangement beyond just the allowance. It really shouldn't have to be a contest between SBs & SDs to see who wins, or who gets taken advantage of the least, it should be a beneficial arrangement for both sides. I've seen posts on SLF that describe what an ideal arrangement should look like, and it can be a high standard to meet that we may not all be able to live up to for one reason or another. But that is one of the things that I like about the SLF forum, it brings different ideas and perspectives to the table and hopefully allows us all to grow and be able to bring our best selves to the bowl.",

Platonic relationships usually take 1 of 3 versions and are truly never platonic for both sides. \n\n1. Guy wants intimacy, girl jerks him around, manipulates him, uses ho tactics on him, gets him to give her money and gifts and strings him along until he finally breaks it off\n2. Girl wants platonic guy agrees to it, she doesnt realize he's going to dangle a carrot and not give her a real allowance until its intimate\n3. Guy has mental or emotional issue and /or is socially awkward and ends up friend zoning himself. Says he's ok with platonic because truthfully he has so many issues, lack of confidence, and just crazes a women's companionship and approval.\n\nI truly dont believe in the fact that platonic is ever mutually beneficial, because no straight heterosexual male is going to hang out without a younger beautiful women and not think of her in a sexual way. People are lying to themselves and others if you think platonic is mutual.\n\nEven for the guy that has no working dick, he would still love to see you naked, and lay next to you and touch your body. That doesnt sound platoni to me.\n\nI think you just dont understand the male psyche, sex and intimacy are hardwired into our brains for procreation of the species, and beautiful women, that are healthy and young are the most desireable of those that attract our attention. If you believe anything other then that, you are mislead and naive.",

I called that out as escorting yesterday and was downvoted while all the other SBs were all \"you go girl.\" Glad to see an SB on here agreeing with me that this escort behavior is *not* sugar dating and is ruining the bowl!",

The problem is that seeking has a lot of bad actors who want to take advantage. They are the problem. It's the rinsers and the salt/splenda daddies that caused need for this \"I'll show you mine when you show me yours\" mentality. \n\nThe SD desires a full-on romantic relationship from the SB and the SB desires generosity and support from the SD. A perfectly reasonable solution to the bad actors problem is for both the SD and the SB to resolve that \"you get the type of arrangement that you want at the exact moment that I get the type of arrangement that I want.\" That way, nobody is risking a salt/splenda/rinse. And I see no reason to lose patience after 2-3 dates, on either side. Take as long as it takes! Just, ehhh, don't expect me to hide my profile in the meantime. \n\nIf you have a better solution that works for both sides, I'm all ears. But for now, the \"all parties get what they want at the same time\" policy is working pretty well for me.",

Yes, to those people, your point is 100% correct. But half those flash rich people aren't truly rich. If you go behind their finances, it's also all show and credit. If you pay attention to all the flash things they are  showing are what everyone knows. They are fronting/showboating.\n\n I have a buddy who sugars one time his date walked away and told him he didn't dress like he had the money to support her. The funny part is he had a watch on that cost more than brand new BMW. She didn't recognize it because it wasn't flashy it was a big name in the watch industry not the jewlary industry. It was expensive because of the precision and hand manufacturing and exclusivity they only make like 200 of each run of watch.  Not because it was covered in gold and flashy.\n\nThe key to me knowing you're talking about flash wealth/rich is when you said I work around them. Most of the true millionares I know. Not the ones who have assets in the million, but the ones have available cash in the millions you would never know. Hell I have one friend who drives a Carrola for years. He only just upgraded to a tesla even then he got a model 3. The only place he actually splurged is on sugering.\n\nAlso most of those flash rich/weatlthy won't have long term sugar relationships. They get more out of different arm candy than having the same arm candy.",

I have plenty of friends I can dine, travel with etc. While being able to do those things with SB is great, if the sex isn't great, no amount of those other things is going to keep me in a SR. The bad thing about putting sex off for long is the time wasted (aka opportunity cost) on something that has no future.\n\n3) Happy to pay for nice dinners, get your Uber or valet, give you a nice gift for 2-3 dates, but if you expect allowance I need to be really confident that you aren't a platonic rinser. The best way to gain my confidence is by not acting like a platonic rinser.\n\nThe beginning of a SR is a very difficult time because neither side can really trust the other, since the sugar motivates so many bad actors to take advantage of people. Maybe rather than thinking about allowance and sex as transactional, think of them as a shortcut for trust.\n\nEdit:\nAlso, FWIW, In over ten years of being in the bowl, no SB I've met ever required more than 2 dates to move to intimacy, except for one who was, in fact, a rinser.",

Just like the rule about not having sex at the 'M&G' is just a suggestion, not a legit rule.\n\nHere is the thing: sugaring is a relationship between two consenting adults.  My own experience?  if we've had a good M&G - spent a couple of hours getting to know each other - most women I meet are open to starting things that day.  Do I pressure it?  Absolutely not.

I would the same thing to someone who was a professional sex worker, too. So it surely applies to SBs, girlfriends, boyfriends, non-binary partners, wives, husbands, consorts, mistresses, and every other damn person.\n\n>Despite what many may say here the notion of having sex after 2-3 dates or by the first/second date is NOT A LEGIT RULE you must follow. \n\nIt's not a rule, legitimate or otherwise, if by rule we mean \"something you have to do because of law or nature\". But if by rule we mean \"rule of thumb\", well it kind of is one. Why? Because even if you're not making financial demands during this pre-sexual-relationship period, you're taking up time. And this would-be SD is looking for a sexual relationship.\n\nIf you're not providing one, he is likely moving on to someone who is. In no way does this obligate a woman to engage in sexual activity on date 2/3/4/whatever. But it should come as no surprise if the failure to do so results in a rapid end to the would-be arrangement.\n\n>We are not desperate here.\n\nYou clearly are not. Experience on Seeking for 6 years tells me something around 1/2 the women are, in fact, desperate.\n\n>SRs offer companionship and romantic parts of a relationship (which may or not include sex) that are not charged by the hour but by the value each party sees in the relationship.\n\nAgain, I don't take issue here conceptually, but *as a practical matter* reality is somewhat different. First of all, in 99% of cases, *it's going to include sex.* I'm not sure suggesting it may not include sex is really helpful to people reading this post. Second of all, while I haven't actually met in person anyone charging by the hour (they do exist in great numbers on the sites), I can tell you that people time boxing dates is *a very real phenomenon in sugaring*. Is that exactly the same? no. But it's close enough that it feels a bit icky.\n\n>Most SDs have greater respect for those who aren't overly self sacrificing anyway. Also, men DO like a teensie bit of chase but show interest as well.\n\nI really don't know what this means... I have great respect for all the SBs I've \"dated\" in this context. But also I'd rather then \"self sacrifice\" a little bit for me without me having to chase it. I'm seeing someone once a week, maybe twice. If they're not feeling super sexual that day (but are otherwise in good health and good spirits), I'm going to want to have sex anyway. I'm going to want her to not make a big deal out of it and be as present as possible.\n\nIs this selfish? *Maybe*. But I'm sugar dating here, not vanilla dating. I'm literally spending time and money on behalf of this. If it's not delivering in all dimensions, why am I bothering?\n\n>SBs step into your power. Take a good look at how you would compliment a man's life... Are you multilingual? Are you creative and artsy? Are you a savvy business mind? Do you have amazing legs? Hazel eyes?\n\nI'm confused again here. Maybe there's some vanishingly small number of SBs who are complementing men's lives with their command of Mandarin and their role as business *consiglieres*. Most are 18-28, finding themselves, not super interested in men their age, wanting/needing a bit more money, appreciating some life advice, enjoying good food, desiring travel they can't afford, etc. etc. \n\nIf she has hazel eyes, she's maybe got beautiful eyes. And when I gaze into them in bed, I may be momentarily transported. But when I go back to work later that day, her beautiful eyes are not exactly \"complementing my life\" any more than surfing Instagram. That's not to say the whole of her isn't compelling -- heck, the reason I sugar at all is because it is -- but I think this idea of yours overstates the role of the vast majority of SBs.\n\n>Please don't let these Splendas/Johns and wannabe SDs lowball you into settling into a transactional cheap experience. \n\nYou're just pushing on a string here. Meet some more SBs. They're the ones setting up these transactional situations before we get a word in edgewise about something more like a relationship. \n\nWe could -- the two sides of this that want *more* \\-- stop considering everyone else that doesn't. This, of course, will leave most SDs without anyone to sugar. And will leave most \"SBs\" without an SD. But sure, let's push for this ideal. I suppose there we agree.\n\n>SDs if you're mad about this you're part of the problem! \n\nGiven your context here, I'm not mad. But I'm sure you would see me as part of the problem. And yet I'm certain my SBs would describe me as very much part of the solution. \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af \n\n>We are the flowers and they are the Bees!\n\nThis feels like both an insult and a weird metaphor. Please don't let an SD pollinate you, whatever that's suppose to mean.",

We can make this about so much more than just sex!  We can make them work for our affections and appreciate us as the complete human beings were are!\"*\n\nAnd I legitimately hear all of that.  I also very much agree that each and every woman I meet on Seeking deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.  But I'm also going to say the same thing that I say on customer and SD sites when guys complain about others ruining it for them by overpaying, giving girls lavish gifts, etc.:  **No single person, or even a small group of people on an online forum, are going to have a real impact on broader market forces.**\n\nThe simple reality is that seeking has become overrun with SDs looking for fast sex and SBs looking for fast cash.  A pretty young girl slogging away at a retail job can post a profile with pretty pics and some enticing words and quickly make more money for one or two dates than she made working 30+ hours at her dayjob.  Best part is that she can do it without the same stigma that would be attached if she posted on a pro escort site.  Package all of that together and the enticements are powerful for parties on either side.\n\nFor those who yearn to see it return to the old days, while I very much hear that, I suspect that ship has sailed.",

We\u2019re you not attracted to the guy? I would suggest holding out to find a guy you could be enthusiastic about instead of holding out as long as possible for someone you aren\u2019t. I would have assumed you just weren\u2019t attracted to me and moved on. \n\nI don\u2019t have a set number of dates, I don\u2019t let rules determine my sex life, I think I have withheld more than vice versa because of poor timing, or not sure that I wanted to take on the responsibility etc. \n\nThere might be men who want to chase, but I don\u2019t.

Three interviews are for meeting executives and potential teams for high priority jobs. \n\n1) From what I've gathered, most SBs and SDs assume a few days to about a week of talking (text and phone) has occured between them before their first meet. \n\n2) What should a baby be looking for in the first date that would cause her to agree to the second? \n\n3) What should a baby be discerning on date #2 that, by the end of it, she's completed her interview and is agreeing to pricing and entering into a relationship? \n\nSD's may get a little irritated with adding in these vanilla ideas like \"playing hard to get\" when we don't do that with literally any other interview process in our lives. By the end of the second date, you've talked to a POT for anywhere between 1-2 weeks and quite a few hours. The issue you are irritated with isn't that SBs aren't spending enough time before agreeing to give sugar, it's that they are ignoring red flags, whittling down their asks, and agreeing to terms they don't like.\n\nAll of which are important to want people to grow a spine! But simplifying that down to \"if you slept with him on the second date, you are no better than an escort.\"\n\nThere is a big difference between getting a job without any interview because they just wanted any warm body, and spending 2 weeks and several conversations talking.",

It is unfortunate, but it is just reality.  \n\nIn the sugar bowl this can get particularly stark - especially if what you call a \"splenda\" daddy offers money that is still ten times the wages a person could get with a legitimate job - one would be foolish to turn that down to hold out for making thirty times that \"and nothing less\" if eviction is days away.  \n\nIt seems rather obnoxious to tell someone who is about to be on the streets to turn down more money than they've ever been able to earn per hour in their life just for some \"principle\" that they should hold out for more.  Are you going to take them in when they have no place to live?  If not, you should not shame or judge them for doing what they need to do to get by.  Everyone in that situation has to make stark choices.",

We take different risks in the bowl. Yes, SDs have greater material means (that's the very basis of any SR) but our wealth makes us primary targets for fraud, blackmail, robbery, and theft. SBs are more prone to abuse or even violence. However, you have to see that it is not sugar-specific. Women in general are more prone to abuse and violence.",

Anyone can do it!\" while failing to understand that things aren't the same as they were 30 years ago. \n\nHaving someone wait 8 months for you is not likely realistic for 99% of pot SBs, so encouraging them to follow suit you are likely cutting their chances drastically no different than a tiktok idiot telling them SDs will line up to provide for them completely just for the chance to chat with them online.\n\nI agree that both SDs and SBs need to know their worth, set their boundaries and expectations, etc. But, yes it DOES take two to tango and you should follow up your \"set your rules in your SR\" advice with \"but be prepared if no one wants to be in a SR with you due to those rules\".

Platonic relationships usually take 1 of 3 versions and are truly never platonic for both sides. \n\n1. Guy wants intimacy, girl jerks him around, manipulates him, uses ho tactics on him, gets him to give her money and gifts and strings him along until he finally breaks it off\n2. Girl wants platonic guy agrees to it, she doesnt realize he's going to dangle a carrot and not give her a real allowance until its intimate\n3. Guy has mental or emotional issue and /or is socially awkward and ends up friend zoning himself. Says he's ok with platonic because truthfully he has so many issues, lack of confidence, and just crazes a women's companionship and approval.\n\nI truly dont believe in the fact that platonic is ever mutually beneficial, because no straight heterosexual male is going to hang out without a younger beautiful women and not think of her in a sexual way. People are lying to themselves and others if you think platonic is mutual.\n\nEven for the guy that has no working dick, he would still love to see you naked, and lay next to you and touch your body. That doesnt sound platoni to me.\n\nI think you just dont understand the male psyche, sex and intimacy are hardwired into our brains for procreation of the species, and beautiful women, that are healthy and young are the most desireable of those that attract our attention. If you believe anything other then that, you are mislead and naive.",

There is a huge difference in the experience when SHE decides she is ready.  And doesn\u2019t rinse in the meantime.",

Yes, to those people, your point is 100% correct. But half those flash rich people aren't truly rich. If you go behind their finances, it's also all show and credit. If you pay attention to all the flash things they are  showing are what everyone knows. They are fronting/showboating.\n\n I have a buddy who sugars one time his date walked away and told him he didn't dress like he had the money to support her. The funny part is he had a watch on that cost more than brand new BMW. She didn't recognize it because it wasn't flashy it was a big name in the watch industry not the jewlary industry. It was expensive because of the precision and hand manufacturing and exclusivity they only make like 200 of each run of watch.  Not because it was covered in gold and flashy.\n\nThe key to me knowing you're talking about flash wealth/rich is when you said I work around them. Most of the true millionares I know. Not the ones who have assets in the million, but the ones have available cash in the millions you would never know. Hell I have one friend who drives a Carrola for years. He only just upgraded to a tesla even then he got a model 3. The only place he actually splurged is on sugering.\n\nAlso most of those flash rich/weatlthy won't have long term sugar relationships. They get more out of different arm candy than having the same arm candy.",

Especially if you have children.  While you may be ok risking living on the street just for yourself, no sane parent is going to want to risk that for their children and they WILL \"lower their standards\" and accept what they can get because they HAVE to.  It is unfortunate, but it is just reality.  \n\nIn the sugar bowl this can get particularly stark - especially if what you call a \"splenda\" daddy offers money that is still ten times the wages a person could get with a legitimate job - one would be foolish to turn that down to hold out for making thirty times that \"and nothing less\" if eviction is days away.  \n\nIt seems rather obnoxious to tell someone who is about to be on the streets to turn down more money than they've ever been able to earn per hour in their life just for some \"principle\" that they should hold out for more.  Are you going to take them in when they have no place to live?  If not, you should not shame or judge them for doing what they need to do to get by.  Everyone in that situation has to make stark choices.",

We take different risks in the bowl. Yes, SDs have greater material means (that's the very basis of any SR) but our wealth makes us primary targets for fraud, blackmail, robbery, and theft. SBs are more prone to abuse or even violence. However, you have to see that it is not sugar-specific. Women in general are more prone to abuse and violence.",

Platonic relationships usually take 1 of 3 versions and are truly never platonic for both sides. \n\n1. Guy wants intimacy, girl jerks him around, manipulates him, uses ho tactics on him, gets him to give her money and gifts and strings him along until he finally breaks it off\n2. Girl wants platonic guy agrees to it, she doesnt realize he's going to dangle a carrot and not give her a real allowance until its intimate\n3. Guy has mental or emotional issue and /or is socially awkward and ends up friend zoning himself. Says he's ok with platonic because truthfully he has so many issues, lack of confidence, and just crazes a women's companionship and approval.\n\nI truly dont believe in the fact that platonic is ever mutually beneficial, because no straight heterosexual male is going to hang out without a younger beautiful women and not think of her in a sexual way. People are lying to themselves and others if you think platonic is mutual.\n\nEven for the guy that has no working dick, he would still love to see you naked, and lay next to you and touch your body. That doesnt sound platoni to me.\n\nI think you just dont understand the male psyche, sex and intimacy are hardwired into our brains for procreation of the species, and beautiful women, that are healthy and young are the most desireable of those that attract our attention. If you believe anything other then that, you are mislead and naive.",

Yes, to those people, your point is 100% correct. But half those flash rich people aren't truly rich. If you go behind their finances, it's also all show and credit. If you pay attention to all the flash things they are  showing are what everyone knows. They are fronting/showboating.\n\n I have a buddy who sugars one time his date walked away and told him he didn't dress like he had the money to support her. The funny part is he had a watch on that cost more than brand new BMW. She didn't recognize it because it wasn't flashy it was a big name in the watch industry not the jewlary industry. It was expensive because of the precision and hand manufacturing and exclusivity they only make like 200 of each run of watch.  Not because it was covered in gold and flashy.\n\nThe key to me knowing you're talking about flash wealth/rich is when you said I work around them. Most of the true millionares I know. Not the ones who have assets in the million, but the ones have available cash in the millions you would never know. Hell I have one friend who drives a Carrola for years. He only just upgraded to a tesla even then he got a model 3. The only place he actually splurged is on sugering.\n\nAlso most of those flash rich/weatlthy won't have long term sugar relationships. They get more out of different arm candy than having the same arm candy.",

It is unfortunate, but it is just reality.  \n\nIn the sugar bowl this can get particularly stark - especially if what you call a \"splenda\" daddy offers money that is still ten times the wages a person could get with a legitimate job - one would be foolish to turn that down to hold out for making thirty times that \"and nothing less\" if eviction is days away.  \n\nIt seems rather obnoxious to tell someone who is about to be on the streets to turn down more money than they've ever been able to earn per hour in their life just for some \"principle\" that they should hold out for more.  Are you going to take them in when they have no place to live?  If not, you should not shame or judge them for doing what they need to do to get by.

We take different risks in the bowl. Yes, SDs have greater material means (that's the very basis of any SR) but our wealth makes us primary targets for fraud, blackmail, robbery, and theft. SBs are more prone to abuse or even violence. However, you have to see that it is not sugar-specific. Women in general are more prone to abuse and violence.",

Platonic relationships usually take 1 of 3 versions and are truly never platonic for both sides. \n\n1. Guy wants intimacy, girl jerks him around, manipulates him, uses ho tactics on him, gets him to give her money and gifts and strings him along until he finally breaks it off\n2. Girl wants platonic guy agrees to it, she doesnt realize he's going to dangle a carrot and not give her a real allowance until its intimate\n3. Guy has mental or emotional issue and /or is socially awkward and ends up friend zoning himself. Says he's ok with platonic because truthfully he has so many issues, lack of confidence, and just crazes a women's companionship and approval.\n\nI truly dont believe in the fact that platonic is ever mutually beneficial, because no straight heterosexual male is going to hang out without a younger beautiful women and not think of her in a sexual way. People are lying to themselves and others if you think platonic is mutual.\n\nEven for the guy that has no working dick, he would still love to see you naked, and lay next to you and touch your body. That doesnt sound platoni to me.\n\nI think you just dont understand the male psyche, sex and intimacy are hardwired into our brains for procreation of the species, and beautiful women, that are healthy and young are the most desireable of those that attract our attention. If you believe anything other then that, you are mislead and naive.",

While you may be ok risking living on the street just for yourself, no sane parent is going to want to risk that for their children and they WILL \"lower their standards\" and accept what they can get because they HAVE to.  It is unfortunate, but it is just reality.  \n\nIn the sugar bowl this can get particularly stark - especially if what you call a \"splenda\" daddy offers money that is still ten times the wages a person could get with a legitimate job - one would be foolish to turn that down to hold out for making thirty times that \"and nothing less\" if eviction is days away.  \n\nIt seems rather obnoxious to tell someone who is about to be on the streets to turn down more money than they've ever been able to earn per hour in their life just for some \"principle\" that they should hold out for more.  Are you going to take them in when they have no place to live?  If not, you should not shame or judge them for doing what they need to do to get by.  Everyone in that situation has to make stark choices.",

Guy wants intimacy, girl jerks him around, manipulates him, uses ho tactics on him, gets him to give her money and gifts and strings him along until he finally breaks it off\n2. Girl wants platonic guy agrees to it, she doesnt realize he's going to dangle a carrot and not give her a real allowance until its intimate\n3. Guy has mental or emotional issue and /or is socially awkward and ends up friend zoning himself. Says he's ok with platonic because truthfully he has so many issues, lack of confidence, and just crazes a women's companionship and approval.\n\nI truly dont believe in the fact that platonic is ever mutually beneficial, because no straight heterosexual male is going to hang out without a younger beautiful women and not think of her in a sexual way. People are lying to themselves and others if you think platonic is mutual.\n\nEven for the guy that has no working dick, he would still love to see you naked, and lay next to you and touch your body. That doesnt sound platoni to me.\n\nI think you just dont understand the male psyche, sex and intimacy are hardwired into our brains for procreation of the species, and beautiful women, that are healthy and young are the most desireable of those that attract our attention. If you believe anything other then that, you are mislead and naive.",

Guy wants intimacy, girl jerks him around, manipulates him, uses ho tactics on him, gets him to give her money and gifts and strings him along until he finally breaks it off\n2. Girl wants platonic guy agrees to it, she doesnt realize he's going to dangle a carrot and not give her a real allowance until its intimate\n3. Guy has mental or emotional issue and /or is socially awkward and ends up friend zoning himself. Says he's ok with platonic because truthfully he has so many issues, lack of confidence, and just crazes a women's companionship and approval.\n\nI truly dont believe in the fact that platonic is ever mutually beneficial, because no straight heterosexual male is going to hang out without a younger beautiful women and not think of her in a sexual way. People are lying to themselves and others if you think platonic is mutual.\n\nEven for the guy that has no working dick, he would still love to see you naked, and lay next to you and touch your body. That doesnt sound platoni to me.\n\nI think you just dont understand the male psyche, sex and intimacy are hardwired into our brains for procreation of the species, and beautiful women, that are healthy and young are the most desireable of those that attract our attention. If you believe anything other then that, you are mislead and naive.",

Guy wants intimacy, girl jerks him around, manipulates him, uses ho tactics on him, gets him to give her money and gifts and strings him along until he finally breaks it off\n2. Girl wants platonic guy agrees to it, she doesnt realize he's going to dangle a carrot and not give her a real allowance until its intimate\n3. Guy has mental or emotional issue and /or is socially awkward and ends up friend zoning himself. Says he's ok with platonic because truthfully he has so many issues, lack of confidence, and just crazes a women's companionship and approval.\n\nI truly dont believe in the fact that platonic is ever mutually beneficial, because no straight heterosexual male is going to hang out without a younger beautiful women and not think of her in a sexual way. People are lying to themselves and others if you think platonic is mutual.\n\nEven for the guy that has no working dick, he would still love to see you naked, and lay next to you and touch your body. That doesnt sound platoni to me.\n\nI think you just dont understand the male psyche, sex and intimacy are hardwired into our brains for procreation of the species, and beautiful women, that are healthy and young are the most desireable of those that attract our attention. If you believe anything other then that, you are mislead and naive.",
