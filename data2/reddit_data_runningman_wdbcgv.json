I was just watching Ep. 502 and thinking the last game was one of the best games in the Bo Pil era and here we are right now, seeing this farewell party for Bo Pil :(\n\nI hope he will also be given a chance to share some thoughts when his last episode airs.\n\nThank You, Bo Pil PD. Thank you for steering our favorite show through the COVID-19 pandemic. Looking forward to your next shows and probably seeing you in RM like how Hwan Jin PD suddenly showed up in the latest episode.",

Then again, if he love RM, which he clearly does, he may think that there may be someone who can do a better job. That remains to be seen.\n\nNo matter who takes over, the change is going to be big. Bopil main focus was the dynamics within the group, and relationship between members, and he worked with them before becoming main pd for years to be able to do so. The new pd most likely an outsider, cause Bopil was already the youngest when he took over. We may really witness some big changes, like maybe adding a new member.",
