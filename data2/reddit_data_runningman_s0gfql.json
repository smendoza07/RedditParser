Look at the good impact that something cute and simple like this can have. \n\nThe fact that JSM takes the initiative to do this - which we see is not business as usual - makes her kindness even more notable. We should all be so lucky to have good people around us. We're all human, and we all make mistakes; sometimes we hurt our friends inadvertently. Even if it's just a little. Happy to see that they are good.",

It definitely should have happened sooner, but I'm hoping it will make a difference now.",

These two are good friends and she'll know most of all that he meant no malice.\n\nIts super awesome of her to just show everyone she's cool with YSC. And I agree with you as well about how for long I wished something similar could have been done for her throughout all those times she was suffering abuse. This just made me admire her more that at the slightest sign of trouble she immediately stood up for her friend.\n\nShe's a sweetheart \u2764\ufe0f",

It\u2019s not a blame to be put on anyone. It\u2019s for the production crew and possibly sechan to take note that certain things should not be aired or blurted out mindlessly, and it\u2019s part of his learning curve to understand what jokes are suitable for CoBig (a gag show), what jokes are not suitable for a non-gag show on an international platform. He has a bigger responsibility for being on a bigger show. I\u2019m sure RM members at one point had also gone through some sort of learning experience like this. \n\nPersonally for me, it\u2019s the comment where sechan said \u201cyou are thinking of him when you are filming kissing scenes in the Show Window right\u201d. As the drama is currently airing, it would cause some drama viewers to be unconsciously reminded of this statement whenever a kissing scene appears or possibly lead to inappropriate discussions because drama viewers heard this from RM. Sechan\u2019s statement could possibly affect the drama and somin is not the only person whose career is involved - any discussions pertaining to the drama could affect the other actors as well (eg: attracting comments like there\u2019s no chemistry between somin and her onscreen partner \u201cbecause she is thinking about Y when doing this scene\u201d, or the scene is so and so because \u201csomin must be thinking of Y\u201d. It\u2019s a risky statement and most importantly, so unnecessary for a variety show game.",

You think the members are there to be nice to each other?   \n\n\nWhile it's not an excuse for dangerous stunts like Sechan vacuuming YJS' ear, think about these : \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  Do you think dipping YJS in mud was completely \"harmless\"? \n*  Do you think LKS swallowing food that has been in someone else's mouth is \"harmless\"?\n*  Do you think KJK's physical attack back then was \"harmless\"?\n*  Remember when LKS was legitimately pissed off when Haha completely scammed him to go to somewhere to meet a person whose criteria didn't even match the mission?\n*  Do you think publicly humiliating the member with over the top costumes (Kwangvatar, skinny pants in winter) was OK? \n* If you watch Outrun, do you know how Haha was legitimetely pissed when KJK promised to give Haha his immunity card only to tore it apart in front of the only man in RM whose courage is the size of a tardigrade? \n\n\"Oh but it is about past relationship and might hurt\"\n\n* **Do you think it's OK to bring up JSJ's marriage as a joke, especially with the secret bank account thing? Do some of you even aware of this skit? Do you treat this less seriously vs JSM's ex because it's the goddamn \"loser arabeoji Jee Seok Jin?\"**\n   *  Do you know how serious this can be on some marriages? Do you think  it's OK to risking his relationship with his wife but unacceptable to bring up past exes?\n   * Do you think portraying him as a bad, negligent family man is nice? Especially when it's repeated every month? \n\nYet our TikTok Grandpa takes it like a champ and sacrifices his whole dignity for the show. \n\n  \nAll I can say is that JSM is a good variety persona.  For all we know, JSM might be doing it for the show too and went with it, and she probably realized early that when Sechan started to dig up her past, she wouldn't stand a chance, so why don't just roll with it and making it funny for the audience to see her own suggested game backfired? It's a known variety technique that YJS often uses (overconfident to the point of epic fail in execution. \n\nDon't portray her as a fragile china vase FFS. She is not made of glass and you guys know that. You guys probably won't respond like this if SJH is treated the same just because she typically lashes out with violence /anger instead of crying. For all we know both RM girls are tough gals with different personalities that enrich the viewing experience. She often gets punished and take it like a champ, just like any other members. So why treat her like a such a vase that should be kept safe behind a lock?\n\nDownvote me, I don't  care. Crazy shit which were bordeline questionable happened back then in early RM, and digging up ex boyfriend for me is just mild. YSC was trying to win. His tactic is brutal but not the most outrageous thing that has happened in RM. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMods - if you want to ban me for this comment I am welcome - just state the reason why I am wrong to post this and I'll be good. I just want people to not take RM too seriously like the members are doing a real squid game every week.",

The worst is Sechan bringing up the ex-name, you could argue the staff bleep out the words so viewers couldnt hear but what about all the staff, stylists, managers who were there listening to the actual name being said.",

It\u2019s not a blame to be put on anyone. It\u2019s for the production crew and possibly sechan to take note that certain things should not be aired or blurted out mindlessly, and it\u2019s part of his learning curve to understand what jokes are suitable for CoBig (a gag show), what jokes are not suitable for a non-gag show on an international platform. He has a bigger responsibility for being on a bigger show. I\u2019m sure RM members at one point had also gone through some sort of learning experience like this. \n\nPersonally for me, it\u2019s the comment where sechan said \u201cyou are thinking of him when you are filming kissing scenes in the Show Window right\u201d. As the drama is currently airing, it would cause some drama viewers to be unconsciously reminded of this statement whenever a kissing scene appears or possibly lead to inappropriate discussions because drama viewers heard this from RM. Sechan\u2019s statement could possibly affect the drama and somin is not the only person whose career is involved - any discussions pertaining to the drama could affect the other actors as well (eg: attracting comments like there\u2019s no chemistry between somin and her onscreen partner \u201cbecause she is thinking about Y when doing this scene\u201d, or the scene is so and so because \u201csomin must be thinking of Y\u201d. It\u2019s a risky statement and most importantly, so unnecessary for a variety show game.",

Like she crushed Sechan in the crying game, should have stuck to that type of games. YJS should have called it after the first warning.  \n  \nI even rated the episode 4/5 because I thought it was so funny.

Somin's kind and soft hearted. YOU CAN TELL she's not the type to keep her composure because she wears her feelings on her sleeve. There's no blame here. The running man members says so. Sechan repeatedly say its a game because they know how she is.\n\nIt was a game and the only ones getting caught up in this ARE THE FANS. Did somin say anything? They are all such good friends and they will handle any feelings behind the scenes. Look at how jae suk takes care of somin after the loss. It's played up for laughs and the members will take care of each other behind the scenes. They all clearly love her and adore her. \n\nTHERE IS NO MESS. I hate these controversies cos they are just played up by fans. The running man cast is a tightly knit cast that cares about each other. You have so little faith in them being close friends that they can't handle a little mean spirit joke? Which they do to ALL THE MEMBERS. I'm sure they will make sure somin is okay cos that's what they are like. \n\nIt's a show where they wanna make people laugh. Stop taking these things so seriously god.",

Haha had a national petition filed against him because he made fun of YJS (lol) and he stopped YSC from doing the same thing in a recent episode. LKS had the same thing happen with that AOA member and probably learnt to be more careful with female guests / PDs learnt to be more careful with editing.",

He had a lapse of judgement in a small moment and was a bit insensitive but I feel like that is the extent of it. That doesn't make him deserving of whatever hate he is recieveing now. As long as he and Somin are good then people should move on.",
