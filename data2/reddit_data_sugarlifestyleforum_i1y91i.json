    "body": "A Smithsonian story popped into my inbox this week, titled \"Everything Was Fake but Her Wealth\"\n\nIt tells the story of Ida Wood, who at the age of 19 moved to New York and decided she wanted a better life, so she did some research and proposed an arrangement to a complete stranger named Benjamin Wood: a married, 37-year-old businessman and politician.\n\nShe wrote him a letter:\n\n    May 28, 1857\n    \n    Mr. Wood\u2014Sir\n    \n    Having heard of you often, I venture to address you from hearing a young lady,\n    one of your \u2018former loves,\u2019 speak of you. She says you are fond of \u2018new faces.\u2019\n    I fancy that as I am new in the city and in \u2018affairs de coeur\u2019 that I might \n    contract an agreeable intimacy with you; of as long duration as you saw fit to\n    have it. I believe that I am not extremely bad looking, nor disagreeable. Perhaps\n    not quite as handsome as the lady with you at present, but I know a little more,\n    and there is an old saying\u2014\u2018Knowledge is power.\u2019 If you would wish an interview\n    address a letter to No. Broadway P O New York stating what time we may meet.\n\nTen years after meeting they were married and it lasted until Benjamin's death in 1900.\n\nI just thought it was interesting how little things have changed in 163 years.",

Imagine for a moment, one of your SBs... perhaps you\u2019re married, to another person or maybe to work, whatever way.. one of them probably never got over you. It takes a toll.. how many times can we be \u201cin love\u201d without feeling it? That\u2019s the real question and I think that that puts the limit on how young most SBs are. How well can they handle understanding that who we love and how we love is never fair?\n\nI\u2019m not saying that two people understanding that the love they share can\u2019t last forever, I\u2019m not saying that that is wrong or not beautiful. Only, that usually it\u2019s not that simple and saying that sugar relationships are \u201cideal\u201d in some way, is a mistake. \n\nI\u2019m a romantic at heart though, so congratulations on your amazing SRs! \u2764\ufe0f\n\nEdit: you said in your comment that emotion is what sustains you\u2026 I think that that is true for me as well.

Mistress or courtesan (depending on how much love vs. Quid pro quo kind of thing) were what mist SBs / SGFs were called. Through all of human history there have been men of wealth and power, many married, and many had women on the side that they cared for and helped. \"Kept Women\" was another term. Essentially mistress. They would pay for them to have their own place, all needs met etc... of course most mistresses, especially like Miss Wood wanted to eventually marry their partner, either out of love or more free access to his money or both. Especially given she was a poor Irish immigrant, and the civil war was about to start (unbeknownst to them) which would make some people richer, a lot of people poorer, and put fear in to a lot of Americans, I am sure she clung extra tightly to him in the early 1860s.\n\nGreat find.",

From the Reynolds Pamphlet:\n\n>\tSome time in the summer of the year 1791 a woman called at my house in the city of Philadelphia and asked to speak with me in private. I attended her into a room apart from the family. With a seeming air of affliction she informed that she was a daughter of a Mr. Lewis, sister to a Mr. G. Livingston of the State of New-York, and wife to a Mr. Reynolds whose father was in the Commissary Department during the war with Great Britain, that her husband, who for a long time had treated her very cruelly, had lately left her, to live with another woman, and in so destitute a condition, that though desirous of returning to her friends she had not the means\u2014that knowing I was a citizen of New-York, she had taken the liberty to apply to my humanity for assistance. I replied, that her situation was a very interesting one\u2014that I was disposed to afford her assistance to convey her to her friends, but this at the moment not being convenient to me (which was the fact) I must request the place of her residence, to which I should bring or send a small supply of money. She told me the street and the number of the house where she lodged. In the evening I put a bank-bill in my pocket and went to the house. I inquired for Mrs. Reynolds and was shewn up stairs, at the head of which she met me and conducted me into a bed room. I took the bill out of my pocket and gave it to her. Some conversation ensued from which it was quickly apparent that other than pecuniary consolation would be acceptable. After this, I had frequent meetings with her, most of them at my own house [DAMN.]; Mrs. Hamilton with her children being absent on a visit to her father. [BOOOOO]  In the course of a short time, she mentioned to me that her husband had solicited a reconciliation, and affected to consult me about it. I advised to it, and was soon after informed by her that it had taken place.\n\nThere is, in true Hamilton fashion of course, a lot more.

Imagine for a moment, one of your SBs... perhaps you\u2019re married, to another person or maybe to work, whatever way.. one of them probably never got over you. It takes a toll.. how many times can we be \u201cin love\u201d without feeling it? That\u2019s the real question and I think that that puts the limit on how young most SBs are. How well can they handle understanding that who we love and how we love is never fair?\n\nI\u2019m not saying that two people understanding that the love they share can\u2019t last forever, I\u2019m not saying that that is wrong or not beautiful. Only, that usually it\u2019s not that simple and saying that sugar relationships are \u201cideal\u201d in some way, is a mistake. \n\nI\u2019m a romantic at heart though, so congratulations on your amazing SRs! \u2764\ufe0f\n\nEdit: you said in your comment that emotion is what sustains you\u2026 I think that that is true for me as well.

Imagine for a moment, one of your SBs... perhaps you\u2019re married, to another person or maybe to work, whatever way.. one of them probably never got over you. It takes a toll.. how many times can we be \u201cin love\u201d without feeling it? That\u2019s the real question and I think that that puts the limit on how young most SBs are. How well can they handle understanding that who we love and how we love is never fair?\n\nI\u2019m not saying that two people understanding that the love they share can\u2019t last forever, I\u2019m not saying that that is wrong or not beautiful. Only, that usually it\u2019s not that simple and saying that sugar relationships are \u201cideal\u201d in some way, is a mistake. \n\nI\u2019m a romantic at heart though, so congratulations on your amazing SRs! \u2764\ufe0f\n\nEdit: you said in your comment that emotion is what sustains you\u2026 I think that that is true for me as well.

Imagine for a moment, one of your SBs... perhaps you\u2019re married, to another person or maybe to work, whatever way.. one of them probably never got over you. It takes a toll.. how many times can we be \u201cin love\u201d without feeling it? That\u2019s the real question and I think that that puts the limit on how young most SBs are. How well can they handle understanding that who we love and how we love is never fair?\n\nI\u2019m not saying that two people understanding that the love they share can\u2019t last forever, I\u2019m not saying that that is wrong or not beautiful. Only, that usually it\u2019s not that simple and saying that sugar relationships are \u201cideal\u201d in some way, is a mistake. \n\nI\u2019m a romantic at heart though, so congratulations on your amazing SRs! \u2764\ufe0f\n\nEdit: you said in your comment that emotion is what sustains you\u2026 I think that that is true for me as well. It\u2019s just that I wonder sometimes if having a \u201caffair de couer\u201d is the best way of satiating that need.",
