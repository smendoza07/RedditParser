    "body": "Trigger Warning -- sexual assault. Made a throwaway acc for this. I've (F 21) been in the bowl for about 2 years. Have had mostly good experiences. I've been with this SD for about 8 months now and we've had a great relationship. He's attractive, attentive, kind, and funny. He's married and works at my university (though I'd probably never see him, he's in admin in a different department). We met on SA and meet usually once a week, sometimes twice, for platonic and non-platonic dates. \n\nJust as a personal preference, I don't do anal ever. I've told him this plenty of times. Last night we smoked a little. After that, while I was laying face-down on the couch it happened. I don't want to get into detail but I clearly said things like \"I don't want to do this,\" \"It hurts too much\" \"I don't like this,\" etc. When he asked me if I wanted to stop, I said yes, but he kept going. It's the next day now and he's apologized 1,000,000 times through text, telling me how bad he feels and that he didn't realize that I was so upset. This behavior was so unlike anything I've ever seen from him -- it is the first time this has ever happened with him. I am still in shock. \n\nI'm not sure why I'm posting, maybe just to feel less alone and see if other SB's have had similar experiences as well? Obviously our relationship is over, but it just feels so shitty. This is not the first time this has happened to me, but this is a first from a non-vanilla relationship. Do you guys have any suggestions as to what I should do?",

I have contacted a counselor @ my school so that I can learn about what next steps I can take. We will talk later today. My closest friend knows everything and is very supportive. I am heavily considering reporting, but am nervous about that.\n\nSecond, I have seen a few comments about how I should protect myself more, as this is not the first time I have been assaulted. It's happened two times before: both with men that had been solid members of two different friend groups -- everyone loved them. I had known one for 4 years and one for 2.

To assume that she made no efforts when she mentioned saying \"no\" and talking about pain several times shows your lack of physical evidence in your assertions. The best you could hope for is an inductive claim, which could never be sound like a deductive claim with physical truth, but your premises would have to be proven true, and you would only be within a potential ratio of accuracy.

I mentioned in an earlier comment that she should put his name on file with a rape kit so he gets flagged if this happens to another woman.\n\nYour \"set of skills\" argument is bullshit. Assault can happen at any time to anyone. And even in the kink community. I know people who have dated someone safely for a year. They played in public with them, knew other people he'd played with, vetted him. Only to have him turn on them and assault them a year into the relationship. Some abusers use long-game strategies. The guys get kicked out of events when people find out. Usually he had a string of silent victims. Currently this is a big problem in the kink community, and a lot of men are screaming about \"Me Too\" because they're getting caught. I recommend you know more before you speak about sexual assault and kink communities. \n\nWhat I actually tell newbies is:\n\n\"There's no one to protect you. If you jump into this you're going down a rabbit hole by yourself. People will tell you you're safe or ways to be safe, but every kink has risk. Some kinks like rope can cause permanent damage if mistakes are made. That's why it's a nerd's sport. Research and take classes to know how someone is supposed to tie you for example. And though these people say they'll protect you, they're not in the room when you go over to a top's house.\"",

I strongly strongly urge you to educate yourself.  This isn't a matter of poor personal decision making.  It's a matter of circumstance.  You must realize the SB's you see may not be \"choosing\" to interact with you; you have resources they need and they weigh the benefit of those resources against the risks associated with acquiring them.  The patients you describe as repeated victims aren't choosing to be repeatedly assaulted.  Most domestic abuse is linked to financial abuse.  Perpetrators choose their victims wisely, someone without resources, supports.\n\nThere is no excuse to hold such antiquated views on gendered violence.  Please seek out some continuing education resources.",

A big part of the repeated assaults is probably psychological and she needs therapy to address that. Yes, there were systemic factors in my initial abuse that lead me to not see red flags (most importantly I was a child) but those mostly impacted my parents - it just made me a vulnerable adult. There is nothing she can do about the systemic factors - there *is* something she can do about her own mind, healing and looking out for the warning signs/red flags better in future.   \n\n\nObvi can't see the original comment, I imagine it was awful. That being said we need to stop treating people like they're hapless victims with no agency or they'll spend their life scared and thinking they can't do anything to stop bad things happening to them because of \"systemic factors\".  It's just not true and is honestly a very harmful attitude.  It just feeds into abuse/mistreatment schemas that people who are repeated assault survivors usually have - the same mental processes that put them in positions where this kind of thing keeps happening.   \n\n\nWe're not victims, we're survivors and we have agency. Yes, people will choose to do whatever they want and there comes a point that you really can't do anything, and yes some people are just that sneaky that you wouldn't notice. But often there are things you can do and can notice to protect yourself and keep yourself safe before it reaches that point. They're hard to do, and for most people come naturally whereas people like us have to learn them - but they can be learned. \n\nOP didn't deserve this, no one does. But OP does have some agency here in terms of what she does next to make sure it doesn't happen again which is primarily to seek help and therapy and to learn to look out for warning signs when engaging with someone.",

As mentioned, many people will either freeze or fawn in these situations, especially people socialized as women in our society. There are a variety of power dynamics at play in situations like this, not the least of which is the physical one- it is quite often not physically safe for women to resist in these situations. \n\nWomen are deeply programmed to be deferent and submissive in bed. It doesn't mean we are asking for it, it means we're well trained. Going against this training is life long work, and the fact that this man took advantage of this training to force himself on a woman who is supposedly special to him is disgusting. \n\nJust about as gross as you trying to figure out how it might have been the woman's fault. \n\nTruly- fuck off.",

He knows what he did was scummy, and he wants you to walk away. It's not because he's a \"good guy\" who just screwed up. \n\n2) Even if you don't pursue legal action, you may consider filing a Title IX complaint with the University. However, depending on your status at the University, just be aware that the process is not always approached with *your* best interests in mind, but the University's. As an administrator, though, they would cut ties with him before overextending themselves. You might consider talking this over with your counselor. I'm a bit lukewarm on this suggestion, but it doesn't have the same legal requirements for getting some measure of \"justice.\" (Note, I'm not saying \"revenge\"...as others have noted, it'd be good if he doesn't have the opportunity to do this again.)",

You argued that she could have prevented the situation, as if what occurred to her was somehow against the status quo. Sexual assault unfortunately is the status quo. It happens at a 1:3 ratio. To assume that she made no efforts when she mentioned saying \"no\" and talking about pain several times shows your lack of physical evidence in your assertions. The best you could hope for is an inductive claim, which could never be sound like a deductive claim with physical truth, but your premises would have to be proven true, and you would only be within a potential ratio of accuracy. You did not fulfill that requirement either. So it came off as victim blaming.",

I mentioned in an earlier comment that she should put his name on file with a rape kit so he gets flagged if this happens to another woman.\n\nYour \"set of skills\" argument is bullshit. Assault can happen at any time to anyone. And even in the kink community. I know people who have dated someone safely for a year. They played in public with them, knew other people he'd played with, vetted him. Only to have him turn on them and assault them a year into the relationship. Some abusers use long-game strategies. The guys get kicked out of events when people find out. Usually he had a string of silent victims. Currently this is a big problem in the kink community, and a lot of men are screaming about \"Me Too\" because they're getting caught. I recommend you know more before you speak about sexual assault and kink communities. \n\nWhat I actually tell newbies is:\n\n\"There's no one to protect you. If you jump into this you're going down a rabbit hole by yourself. People will tell you you're safe or ways to be safe, but every kink has risk. Some kinks like rope can cause permanent damage if mistakes are made. That's why it's a nerd's sport. Research and take classes to know how someone is supposed to tie you for example. And though these people say they'll protect you, they're not in the room when you go over to a top's house.\"",

I strongly strongly urge you to educate yourself.  This isn't a matter of poor personal decision making.  It's a matter of circumstance.  You must realize the SB's you see may not be \"choosing\" to interact with you; you have resources they need and they weigh the benefit of those resources against the risks associated with acquiring them.  The patients you describe as repeated victims aren't choosing to be repeatedly assaulted.  Most domestic abuse is linked to financial abuse.  Perpetrators choose their victims wisely, someone without resources, supports.\n\nThere is no excuse to hold such antiquated views on gendered violence.  Please seek out some continuing education resources.",

A big part of the repeated assaults is probably psychological and she needs therapy to address that. Yes, there were systemic factors in my initial abuse that lead me to not see red flags (most importantly I was a child) but those mostly impacted my parents - it just made me a vulnerable adult. There is nothing she can do about the systemic factors - there *is* something she can do about her own mind, healing and looking out for the warning signs/red flags better in future.   \n\n\nObvi can't see the original comment, I imagine it was awful. That being said we need to stop treating people like they're hapless victims with no agency or they'll spend their life scared and thinking they can't do anything to stop bad things happening to them because of \"systemic factors\".  It's just not true and is honestly a very harmful attitude.  It just feeds into abuse/mistreatment schemas that people who are repeated assault survivors usually have - the same mental processes that put them in positions where this kind of thing keeps happening.   \n\n\nWe're not victims, we're survivors and we have agency. Yes, people will choose to do whatever they want and there comes a point that you really can't do anything, and yes some people are just that sneaky that you wouldn't notice. But often there are things you can do and can notice to protect yourself and keep yourself safe before it reaches that point. They're hard to do, and for most people come naturally whereas people like us have to learn them - but they can be learned. \n\nOP didn't deserve this, no one does. But OP does have some agency here in terms of what she does next to make sure it doesn't happen again which is primarily to seek help and therapy and to learn to look out for warning signs when engaging with someone.",

You argued that she could have prevented the situation, as if what occurred to her was somehow against the status quo. Sexual assault unfortunately is the status quo. It happens at a 1:3 ratio. To assume that she made no efforts when she mentioned saying \"no\" and talking about pain several times shows your lack of physical evidence in your assertions. The best you could hope for is an inductive claim, which could never be sound like a deductive claim with physical truth, but your premises would have to be proven true, and you would only be within a potential ratio of accuracy. You did not fulfill that requirement either. So it came off as victim blaming.",

Assault can happen at any time to anyone. And even in the kink community. I know people who have dated someone safely for a year. They played in public with them, knew other people he'd played with, vetted him. Only to have him turn on them and assault them a year into the relationship. Some abusers use long-game strategies. The guys get kicked out of events when people find out. Usually he had a string of silent victims. Currently this is a big problem in the kink community, and a lot of men are screaming about \"Me Too\" because they're getting caught. I recommend you know more before you speak about sexual assault and kink communities. \n\nWhat I actually tell newbies is:\n\n\"There's no one to protect you. If you jump into this you're going down a rabbit hole by yourself. People will tell you you're safe or ways to be safe, but every kink has risk. Some kinks like rope can cause permanent damage if mistakes are made. That's why it's a nerd's sport. Research and take classes to know how someone is supposed to tie you for example. And though these people say they'll protect you, they're not in the room when you go over to a top's house.\"",

A big part of the repeated assaults is probably psychological and she needs therapy to address that. Yes, there were systemic factors in my initial abuse that lead me to not see red flags (most importantly I was a child) but those mostly impacted my parents - it just made me a vulnerable adult. There is nothing she can do about the systemic factors - there *is* something she can do about her own mind, healing and looking out for the warning signs/red flags better in future.   \n\n\nObvi can't see the original comment, I imagine it was awful. That being said we need to stop treating people like they're hapless victims with no agency or they'll spend their life scared and thinking they can't do anything to stop bad things happening to them because of \"systemic factors\".  It's just not true and is honestly a very harmful attitude.  It just feeds into abuse/mistreatment schemas that people who are repeated assault survivors usually have - the same mental processes that put them in positions where this kind of thing keeps happening.   \n\n\nWe're not victims, we're survivors and we have agency. Yes, people will choose to do whatever they want and there comes a point that you really can't do anything, and yes some people are just that sneaky that you wouldn't notice. But often there are things you can do and can notice to protect yourself and keep yourself safe before it reaches that point. They're hard to do, and for most people come naturally whereas people like us have to learn them - but they can be learned. \n\nOP didn't deserve this, no one does. But OP does have some agency here in terms of what she does next to make sure it doesn't happen again which is primarily to seek help and therapy and to learn to look out for warning signs when engaging with someone.",

You argued that she could have prevented the situation, as if what occurred to her was somehow against the status quo. Sexual assault unfortunately is the status quo. It happens at a 1:3 ratio. To assume that she made no efforts when she mentioned saying \"no\" and talking about pain several times shows your lack of physical evidence in your assertions. The best you could hope for is an inductive claim, which could never be sound like a deductive claim with physical truth, but your premises would have to be proven true, and you would only be within a potential ratio of accuracy. You did not fulfill that requirement either. So it came off as victim blaming.",

I mentioned in an earlier comment that she should put his name on file with a rape kit so he gets flagged if this happens to another woman.\n\nYour \"set of skills\" argument is bullshit. Assault can happen at any time to anyone. And even in the kink community. I know people who have dated someone safely for a year. They played in public with them, knew other people he'd played with, vetted him. Only to have him turn on them and assault them a year into the relationship. Some abusers use long-game strategies. The guys get kicked out of events when people find out. Usually he had a string of silent victims. Currently this is a big problem in the kink community, and a lot of men are screaming about \"Me Too\" because they're getting caught. I recommend you know more before you speak about sexual assault and kink communities. \n\nWhat I actually tell newbies is:\n\n\"There's no one to protect you. If you jump into this you're going down a rabbit hole by yourself. People will tell you you're safe or ways to be safe, but every kink has risk. Some kinks like rope can cause permanent damage if mistakes are made. That's why it's a nerd's sport. Research and take classes to know how someone is supposed to tie you for example. And though these people say they'll protect you, they're not in the room when you go over to a top's house.\"",
