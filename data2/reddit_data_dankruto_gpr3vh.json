Before dragon ball super broly, Dbz Broly is not canon in neither the manga nor the anime BUT Akira toriyama did create and authorize him. Only dbs broly is. Same with characters in the video games that Akira toriyama has created and authorized.\n\n BUT there is movie continuity within the dbz movies.

Before dragon ball super broly, Dbz Broly is not canon in neither the manga nor the anime BUT Akira toriyama did create and authorize him. Only dbs broly is. Same with characters in the video games that Akira toriyama has created and authorized.\n\n BUT there is movie continuity within the dbz movies.

Before dragon ball super broly, Dbz Broly is not canon in neither the manga nor the anime BUT Akira toriyama did create and authorize him. Only dbs broly is. Same with characters in the video games that Akira toriyama has created and authorized.\n\n BUT there is movie continuity within the dbz movies.

Before dragon ball super broly, Dbz Broly is not canon in neither the manga nor the anime BUT Akira toriyama did create and authorize him. Only dbs broly is. Same with characters in the video games that Akira toriyama has created and authorized.\n\n BUT there is movie continuity within the dbz movies.

Before dragon ball super broly, Dbz Broly is not canon in neither the manga nor the anime BUT Akira toriyama did create and authorize him. Only dbs broly is. Same with characters in the video games that Akira toriyama has created and authorized.\n\n BUT there is movie continuity within the dbz movies.

Before dragon ball super broly, Dbz Broly is not canon in neither the manga nor the anime BUT Akira toriyama did create and authorize him. Only dbs broly is. Same with characters in the video games that Akira toriyama has created and authorized.\n\n BUT there is movie continuity within the dbz movies.

Before dragon ball super broly, Dbz Broly is not canon in neither the manga nor the anime BUT Akira toriyama did create and authorize him. Only dbs broly is. Same with characters in the video games that Akira toriyama has created and authorized.\n\n BUT there is movie continuity within the dbz movies.

So my boruto is different than your boruto. Reading 2 separate stories. Ill agree with you there.\n\nAs for the author authorizing and creating characters, that can be misleading. Before dragon ball super broly, Dbz Broly is not canon in neither the manga nor the anime BUT Akira toriyama did create and authorize him. Only dbs broly is. Same with characters in the video games that Akira toriyama has created and authorized.\n\n BUT there is movie continuity within the dbz movies. So like I said, ill agree with you as in they are in their own separate universe. Manga universe, anime universe, movie universe and video game universe.",
