    "body": "I recently had my first M&G and had a nice time. We easily talked for a few hours, and he sent me $400 after I left. He was a total gentleman when I said I wasn\u2019t interested in an arrangement, but he asked if I could hang out with his mom once or twice a month for an allowance. She had just suffered a stroke, and POT was having trouble finding a paid companion. He thought I would be a perfect fit for his mom, and he was right! I go to her home, cook dinner, put on Jeopardy, and just hang out with this guy\u2019s mom. It\u2019s a blast... she is like a living time machine, and she is HILARIOUS! \n\nI never thought something so wholesome could come out of SA. Anybody else have any POTs/exes lead to unexpected friendships or work??",
