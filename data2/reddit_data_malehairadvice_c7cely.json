Undercut with a pony would look cool too, keeps the length but a bit more rough n ready!",

I know when I was pre-t and past age 16 I was very anxious about the fact I didn't have natural sideburns, so this hairstyle allows you to keep your ears slightly hidden but at the same time, allows you to keep the length. don't be afraid of ditching your hair! I know it's a huge control factor, especially for us trans\\* people, but buzzing it is never a bad idea.",

Keep it straight and keep volume out and it's a man's style.\n\nIf you're looking a shorter but somewhat androgynous look, I'd recommend something that's about three-to-four inches of length on top, but swept back and with side-burns. You can wear it down and forward if you want to appear more feminine, and back, exposing sideburns, if you want to look more masculine.",

If someone claims to have an experience and there's no reason to doubt them (why would a trans person want to go through all the shit they do) who are you to tell them that experience is invalid?",

Graves of trans- or third-gender people in Europe and America have been identified from 4500 years ago, and likely depictions occur in art around the Mediterranean from 9000 to 3700 years ago.

If someone claims to have an experience and there's no reason to doubt them (why would a trans person want to go through all the shit they do) who are you to tell them that experience is invalid?",

Graves of trans- or third-gender people in Europe and America have been identified from 4500 years ago, and likely depictions occur in art around the Mediterranean from 9000 to 3700 years ago.

Sumerian and Akkadian texts from 4500 years ago document transgender priests, and Assyrian texts document trans prostitutes; evidence suggests these gender roles go back to prehistoric times and may have a common origin with third gender roles that were accepted in America before European colonization, some of which (like Navajo n\u00e1dleehi and Zuni lhamana) survived colonizers' hostility. Graves of trans- or third-gender people in Europe and America have been identified from 4500 years ago, and likely depictions occur in art around the Mediterranean from 9000 to 3700 years ago.

There are more than two of each of those. Gender fluidity is scientifically researched and verifiable and becoming better understood every day.\n\nYou can stick to facts, just do more research so you have the right ones. And don't ignore what is at the convenience of your belief system.\n\nAlso there's no need to conflate transgenderism with criminals. That's irresponsible and contributes to the shaming culture you claim to be against. You can disagree without animosity.",
