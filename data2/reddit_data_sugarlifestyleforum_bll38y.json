Nearly every image (not all but most) gets a vote of confidence from someone. **It\u2019s not about how you view yourself but how the SBs view you.**\n\n[Let me be clear.](https://youtu.be/5oNcHS0c5W8?t=3) Every man is wealthy to someone. **Not every net worth will have lots of success in every town, city or region.** If you are 1 of a 1000 small business owners with some discretionary income, I wish you serious luck. If you are 1 of 3 \"thick wallet with liquid assets\" Billionaires with a LinkedIn profile and a diamond account (strange example I know) you may have  tons of interest because you are a rare find for women in your area.\n\nI like the men pictured 1 - 9. If I were asked to pick one from a line up of my next investors meeting it would be number 5 or 7 depending on how much money he was willing to invest into my bank account!\n\n**Yes I did create this chart...because the idea that people should be compared like this is god-damned ridiculous.",
