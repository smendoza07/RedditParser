Nothin about him is Gary Stu other than his chakra affinities, which he got because his dad is basically Ninja god. Not even mentioning his personal struggles.\n\n2. Yeah because Sasuke never used Fireball Jutsu in early Naruto and since he was a kid. Why did he do it when he was a kid? OHH because he trained with his family. I wonder how Boruto could do that...\n\n3. Remember when Kurama straight up said to Naruto\u2019s face that he sabotaged his entire chackra control system? Damn must be easy to forget that kinda stuff. \n\nRemember when Naruto learned a forbidden Jutsu in the first episode?",

The show implies Naruto didn't  even teach him the shadow Clone jutsu. \n\n2.) I was referencing how Kakashi said in pretty much the third episode that Sauske's use of the fireball justu is virtually unheard and Kakashi said genin shouldn't have enough chakra to use it. Which in addition to Sauske being labeled as a prodigy, further shows Sauske's talent. Also he was still taken to town by Kakashi, meanwhile Boruto was able to hold his own aganist kakashi.\n\n3.)

Not sure why Kakashi woulda said that, when him and and Obito were using elementals as genin, he was prolly referring to all the other Genin he was training before. It\u2019s not rare for Genin to know elemental jutsu, just all of the main characters from the Naruto era specialized in their clan jutsu, which is arguably more useful than elemental jutsu. Kakashi also said he\u2019s gotten soft we than he used to be at the end of the test arc too.\n\n3.) ok? Good for Naruto? Part of Borutos whole arc is to find what to work towards when everything is seemingly given to him.

He can only make a handful of clones and even without using the nine tails Naruto could make a thousand. But three nature transformations is too much even for a prodigy.

Naruto kinda spoiled us with his shadow clones, he really is the only one who could handle multi-shadow clone jutsu because of Kurama. I\u2019m also not sure of the difference between multi-shadow clone and regular shadow clone jutsu. I\u2019m pretty sure Boruto uses the latter. He keeps gaining clones though the series though. Also Boruto really is supposed to be the exception though, because like I said before, his dad is like basically ninja god, he coulda ended up with any of em.\n\n3.) I disagree obviously, I think a lot of people see him be mean to Naruto and just write him off permanently.  I see him as someone who misses the time he spent with his dad as a kid and is very protective of his sister. He is cocky, but that\u2019s what I like about him, and how creative he is with his attacks (outside of Rasengan spam). I think Boruto is what Naruto woulda been had the Nine Tails never attacked. By this I mean Naruto woulda been acting out to get his dads attention. \n\nAlso, I assume you haven\u2019t read the manga and I really like the philosophy he\u2019s going toward having which will become more obvious as the story progresses.",

The whole reason why he hates Naruto is kind of contrived, naruto produced hundreds of Kage level shadow Clones during the war and now struggles with one. \n\nKushina would have beat that out of him. Minato wouldn't have writer induced nerf either. I guess it goes to show that kishi made the wrong choice of Naruto and Hinita. Naruto should have listened to Kushina, and married a girl like her (Sakura).\n\nI read it when it first came how but I hated Boruto, how they nerfed my boy Naruto, and the last straw was when they teased Sarada being Karin's daughter but then had her be Sakura's daughter.",

Yeah because Sasuke never used Fireball Jutsu in early Naruto and since he was a kid. Why did he do it when he was a kid? OHH because he trained with his family. I wonder how Boruto could do that...\n\n3. Remember when Kurama straight up said to Naruto\u2019s face that he sabotaged his entire chackra control system?

He knows the gentle Fist despite not having a Bygakuan, and it someone is useful despite the gentle Fist relying completely on the Bygakuan in order to be effective. The show implies Naruto didn't  even teach him the shadow Clone jutsu. \n\n2.) I was referencing how Kakashi said in pretty much the third episode that Sauske's use of the fireball justu is virtually unheard and Kakashi said genin shouldn't have enough chakra to use it. Which in addition to Sauske being labeled as a prodigy, further shows Sauske's talent. Also he was still taken to town by Kakashi, meanwhile Boruto was able to hold his own aganist kakashi.\n\n3.) Naruto worker to overcome that by sheer training and willpower. \n\nDo you not recall how motivated Naruto was to learn that jutsu and messed up he looked after learning the justu?",

Gentle Fist is a fighting form, you can know it without Byakugan, but he won\u2019t be disabling any chakra points without it. (This is shown when he uses open palm stikes) \n\n2.) Not sure why Kakashi woulda said that, when him and and Obito were using elementals as genin, he was prolly referring to all the other Genin he was training before. It\u2019s not rare for Genin to know elemental jutsu, just all of the main characters from the Naruto era specialized in their clan jutsu, which is arguably more useful than elemental jutsu. Kakashi also said he\u2019s gotten soft we than he used to be at the end of the test arc too.\n\n3.) ok? Good for Naruto? Part of Borutos whole arc is to find what to work towards when everything is seemingly given to him.

I lean more torwards Sarada.\n\n2.) Uzumaki do have both, but Boruto didn't seem to inherit anything from the Uzumakis. He can only make a handful of clones and even without using the nine tails Naruto could make a thousand. But three nature transformations is too much even for a prodigy. Each of prodigies we saw before typically only had one, maybe two by the time they 13 or 14. \n\n3.) He also is just an unlikable person and seems more like a fanfiction character than a real character.\n\nYou're good, I understand.",

Boruto could\u2019ve won that had he actually trained and not took the easy way. I\u2019m not sure if Sarada has learned chidori at that point. Even then, I don\u2019t think Boruto could beat Shinki 1 on 1 at base. I think Mitsuki woulda bodied him if he used Sage Mode though lol.\n\n2.) Naruto kinda spoiled us with his shadow clones, he really is the only one who could handle multi-shadow clone jutsu because of Kurama. I\u2019m also not sure of the difference between multi-shadow clone and regular shadow clone jutsu. I\u2019m pretty sure Boruto uses the latter. He keeps gaining clones though the series though. Also Boruto really is supposed to be the exception though, because like I said before, his dad is like basically ninja god, he coulda ended up with any of em.\n\n3.) I disagree obviously, I think a lot of people see him be mean to Naruto and just write him off permanently.  I see him as someone who misses the time he spent with his dad as a kid and is very protective of his sister. He is cocky, but that\u2019s what I like about him, and how creative he is with his attacks (outside of Rasengan spam). I think Boruto is what Naruto woulda been had the Nine Tails never attacked. By this I mean Naruto woulda been acting out to get his dads attention. \n\nAlso, I assume you haven\u2019t read the manga and I really like the philosophy he\u2019s going toward having which will become more obvious as the story progresses.",

The whole reason why he hates Naruto is kind of contrived, naruto produced hundreds of Kage level shadow Clones during the war and now struggles with one. \n\nKushina would have beat that out of him. Minato wouldn't have writer induced nerf either. I guess it goes to show that kishi made the wrong choice of Naruto and Hinita. Naruto should have listened to Kushina, and married a girl like her (Sakura).\n\nI read it when it first came how but I hated Boruto, how they nerfed my boy Naruto, and the last straw was when they teased Sarada being Karin's daughter but then had her be Sakura's daughter.",

Yeah because Sasuke never used Fireball Jutsu in early Naruto and since he was a kid. Why did he do it when he was a kid? OHH because he trained with his family. I wonder how Boruto could do that...\n\n3. Remember when Kurama straight up said to Naruto\u2019s face that he sabotaged his entire chackra control system?

The show implies Naruto didn't  even teach him the shadow Clone jutsu. \n\n2.) I was referencing how Kakashi said in pretty much the third episode that Sauske's use of the fireball justu is virtually unheard and Kakashi said genin shouldn't have enough chakra to use it. Which in addition to Sauske being labeled as a prodigy, further shows Sauske's talent. Also he was still taken to town by Kakashi, meanwhile Boruto was able to hold his own aganist kakashi.\n\n3.) Naruto worker to overcome that by sheer training and willpower. \n\nDo you not recall how motivated Naruto was to learn that jutsu and messed up he looked after learning the justu?",

Gentle Fist is a fighting form, you can know it without Byakugan, but he won\u2019t be disabling any chakra points without it. (This is shown when he uses open palm stikes) \n\n2.) Not sure why Kakashi woulda said that, when him and and Obito were using elementals as genin, he was prolly referring to all the other Genin he was training before. It\u2019s not rare for Genin to know elemental jutsu, just all of the main characters from the Naruto era specialized in their clan jutsu, which is arguably more useful than elemental jutsu. Kakashi also said he\u2019s gotten soft we than he used to be at the end of the test arc too.\n\n3.) ok? Good for Naruto? Part of Borutos whole arc is to find what to work towards when everything is seemingly given to him. (Which it isn\u2019t, he realizes this in the Chunin exams and cheats multiple times because  he is desperate.)",

Which I thought was werid, had Boruto or more likely Sarada trained and learned the chidori as they both have lighting natures then either ornwould have beat Shinki. I lean more torwards Sarada.\n\n2.) Uzumaki do have both, but Boruto didn't seem to inherit anything from the Uzumakis. He can only make a handful of clones and even without using the nine tails Naruto could make a thousand. But three nature transformations is too much even for a prodigy. Each of prodigies we saw before typically only had one, maybe two by the time they 13 or 14. \n\n3.) He also is just an unlikable person and seems more like a fanfiction character than a real character.\n\nYou're good, I understand.",

Boruto could\u2019ve won that had he actually trained and not took the easy way. I\u2019m not sure if Sarada has learned chidori at that point. Even then, I don\u2019t think Boruto could beat Shinki 1 on 1 at base. I think Mitsuki woulda bodied him if he used Sage Mode though lol.\n\n2.) Naruto kinda spoiled us with his shadow clones, he really is the only one who could handle multi-shadow clone jutsu because of Kurama. I\u2019m also not sure of the difference between multi-shadow clone and regular shadow clone jutsu. I\u2019m pretty sure Boruto uses the latter. He keeps gaining clones though the series though. Also Boruto really is supposed to be the exception though, because like I said before, his dad is like basically ninja god, he coulda ended up with any of em.\n\n3.) I disagree obviously, I think a lot of people see him be mean to Naruto and just write him off permanently.  I see him as someone who misses the time he spent with his dad as a kid and is very protective of his sister. He is cocky, but that\u2019s what I like about him, and how creative he is with his attacks (outside of Rasengan spam). I think Boruto is what Naruto woulda been had the Nine Tails never attacked. By this I mean Naruto woulda been acting out to get his dads attention. \n\nAlso, I assume you haven\u2019t read the manga and I really like the philosophy he\u2019s going toward having which will become more obvious as the story progresses.",

The whole reason why he hates Naruto is kind of contrived, naruto produced hundreds of Kage level shadow Clones during the war and now struggles with one. \n\nKushina would have beat that out of him. Minato wouldn't have writer induced nerf either. I guess it goes to show that kishi made the wrong choice of Naruto and Hinita. Naruto should have listened to Kushina, and married a girl like her (Sakura).\n\nI read it when it first came how but I hated Boruto, how they nerfed my boy Naruto, and the last straw was when they teased Sarada being Karin's daughter but then had her be Sakura's daughter.",

Yeah because Sasuke never used Fireball Jutsu in early Naruto and since he was a kid. Why did he do it when he was a kid? OHH because he trained with his family. I wonder how Boruto could do that...\n\n3. Remember when Kurama straight up said to Naruto\u2019s face that he sabotaged his entire chackra control system? Damn must be easy to forget that kinda stuff. \n\nRemember when Naruto learned a forbidden Jutsu in the first episode?",

He technically didn't need to cheat, given his abilities he just needed to actually try and put some effort it rather than take the easy way out. He knows the gentle Fist despite not having a Bygakuan, and it someone is useful despite the gentle Fist relying completely on the Bygakuan in order to be effective. The show implies Naruto didn't  even teach him the shadow Clone jutsu. \n\n2.) I was referencing how Kakashi said in pretty much the third episode that Sauske's use of the fireball justu is virtually unheard and Kakashi said genin shouldn't have enough chakra to use it. Which in addition to Sauske being labeled as a prodigy, further shows Sauske's talent. Also he was still taken to town by Kakashi, meanwhile Boruto was able to hold his own aganist kakashi.\n\n3.) Naruto worker to overcome that by sheer training and willpower. \n\nDo you not recall how motivated Naruto was to learn that jutsu and messed up he looked after learning the justu?",

Gentle Fist is a fighting form, you can know it without Byakugan, but he won\u2019t be disabling any chakra points without it. (This is shown when he uses open palm stikes) \n\n2.) Not sure why Kakashi woulda said that, when him and and Obito were using elementals as genin, he was prolly referring to all the other Genin he was training before. It\u2019s not rare for Genin to know elemental jutsu, just all of the main characters from the Naruto era specialized in their clan jutsu, which is arguably more useful than elemental jutsu. Kakashi also said he\u2019s gotten soft we than he used to be at the end of the test arc too.\n\n3.) ok? Good for Naruto? Part of Borutos whole arc is to find what to work towards when everything is seemingly given to him. (Which it isn\u2019t, he realizes this in the Chunin exams and cheats multiple times because  he is desperate.)",

He can only make a handful of clones and even without using the nine tails Naruto could make a thousand. But three nature transformations is too much even for a prodigy. Each of prodigies we saw before typically only had one, maybe two by the time they 13 or 14. \n\n3.)

Even then, I don\u2019t think Boruto could beat Shinki 1 on 1 at base. I think Mitsuki woulda bodied him if he used Sage Mode though lol.\n\n2.) Naruto kinda spoiled us with his shadow clones, he really is the only one who could handle multi-shadow clone jutsu because of Kurama. I\u2019m also not sure of the difference between multi-shadow clone and regular shadow clone jutsu. I\u2019m pretty sure Boruto uses the latter. He keeps gaining clones though the series though. Also Boruto really is supposed to be the exception though, because like I said before, his dad is like basically ninja god, he coulda ended up with any of em.\n\n3.) I disagree obviously, I think a lot of people see him be mean to Naruto and just write him off permanently.  I see him as someone who misses the time he spent with his dad as a kid and is very protective of his sister. He is cocky, but that\u2019s what I like about him, and how creative he is with his attacks (outside of Rasengan spam). I think Boruto is what Naruto woulda been had the Nine Tails never attacked. By this I mean Naruto woulda been acting out to get his dads attention. \n\nAlso, I assume you haven\u2019t read the manga and I really like the philosophy he\u2019s going toward having which will become more obvious as the story progresses.",

Nothin about him is Gary Stu other than his chakra affinities, which he got because his dad is basically Ninja god. Not even mentioning his personal struggles.\n\n2. Yeah because Sasuke never used Fireball Jutsu in early Naruto and since he was a kid. Why did he do it when he was a kid? OHH because he trained with his family. I wonder how Boruto could do that...\n\n3. Remember when Kurama straight up said to Naruto\u2019s face that he sabotaged his entire chackra control system? Damn must be easy to forget that kinda stuff. \n\nRemember when Naruto learned a forbidden Jutsu in the first episode?",

He knows the gentle Fist despite not having a Bygakuan, and it someone is useful despite the gentle Fist relying completely on the Bygakuan in order to be effective. The show implies Naruto didn't  even teach him the shadow Clone jutsu. \n\n2.) I was referencing how Kakashi said in pretty much the third episode that Sauske's use of the fireball justu is virtually unheard and Kakashi said genin shouldn't have enough chakra to use it. Which in addition to Sauske being labeled as a prodigy, further shows Sauske's talent. Also he was still taken to town by Kakashi, meanwhile Boruto was able to hold his own aganist kakashi.\n\n3.) Naruto worker to overcome that by sheer training and willpower. \n\nDo you not recall how motivated Naruto was to learn that jutsu and messed up he looked after learning the justu?",

Gentle Fist is a fighting form, you can know it without Byakugan, but he won\u2019t be disabling any chakra points without it. (This is shown when he uses open palm stikes) \n\n2.) Not sure why Kakashi woulda said that, when him and and Obito were using elementals as genin, he was prolly referring to all the other Genin he was training before. It\u2019s not rare for Genin to know elemental jutsu, just all of the main characters from the Naruto era specialized in their clan jutsu, which is arguably more useful than elemental jutsu. Kakashi also said he\u2019s gotten soft we than he used to be at the end of the test arc too.\n\n3.) ok? Good for Naruto? Part of Borutos whole arc is to find what to work towards when everything is seemingly given to him. (Which it isn\u2019t, he realizes this in the Chunin exams and cheats multiple times because  he is desperate.)",

He can only make a handful of clones and even without using the nine tails Naruto could make a thousand. But three nature transformations is too much even for a prodigy. Each of prodigies we saw before typically only had one, maybe two by the time they 13 or 14. \n\n3.)

Even then, I don\u2019t think Boruto could beat Shinki 1 on 1 at base. I think Mitsuki woulda bodied him if he used Sage Mode though lol.\n\n2.) Naruto kinda spoiled us with his shadow clones, he really is the only one who could handle multi-shadow clone jutsu because of Kurama. I\u2019m also not sure of the difference between multi-shadow clone and regular shadow clone jutsu. I\u2019m pretty sure Boruto uses the latter. He keeps gaining clones though the series though. Also Boruto really is supposed to be the exception though, because like I said before, his dad is like basically ninja god, he coulda ended up with any of em.\n\n3.) I disagree obviously, I think a lot of people see him be mean to Naruto and just write him off permanently.  I see him as someone who misses the time he spent with his dad as a kid and is very protective of his sister. He is cocky, but that\u2019s what I like about him, and how creative he is with his attacks (outside of Rasengan spam). I think Boruto is what Naruto woulda been had the Nine Tails never attacked. By this I mean Naruto woulda been acting out to get his dads attention. \n\nAlso, I assume you haven\u2019t read the manga and I really like the philosophy he\u2019s going toward having which will become more obvious as the story progresses.",

Which I thought was werid, had Boruto or more likely Sarada trained and learned the chidori as they both have lighting natures then either ornwould have beat Shinki.

He can only make a handful of clones and even without using the nine tails Naruto could make a thousand. But three nature transformations is too much even for a prodigy. Each of prodigies we saw before typically only had one, maybe two by the time they 13 or 14. \n\n3.)

I\u2019m not sure if Sarada has learned chidori at that point. Even then, I don\u2019t think Boruto could beat Shinki 1 on 1 at base. I think Mitsuki woulda bodied him if he used Sage Mode though lol.\n\n2.) Naruto kinda spoiled us with his shadow clones, he really is the only one who could handle multi-shadow clone jutsu because of Kurama. I\u2019m also not sure of the difference between multi-shadow clone and regular shadow clone jutsu. I\u2019m pretty sure Boruto uses the latter. He keeps gaining clones though the series though. Also Boruto really is supposed to be the exception though, because like I said before, his dad is like basically ninja god, he coulda ended up with any of em.\n\n3.) I disagree obviously, I think a lot of people see him be mean to Naruto and just write him off permanently.  I see him as someone who misses the time he spent with his dad as a kid and is very protective of his sister. He is cocky, but that\u2019s what I like about him, and how creative he is with his attacks (outside of Rasengan spam). I think Boruto is what Naruto woulda been had the Nine Tails never attacked. By this I mean Naruto woulda been acting out to get his dads attention. \n\nAlso, I assume you haven\u2019t read the manga and I really like the philosophy he\u2019s going toward having which will become more obvious as the story progresses.",

He knows the gentle Fist despite not having a Bygakuan, and it someone is useful despite the gentle Fist relying completely on the Bygakuan in order to be effective. The show implies Naruto didn't  even teach him the shadow Clone jutsu. \n\n2.) I was referencing how Kakashi said in pretty much the third episode that Sauske's use of the fireball justu is virtually unheard and Kakashi said genin shouldn't have enough chakra to use it. Which in addition to Sauske being labeled as a prodigy, further shows Sauske's talent. Also he was still taken to town by Kakashi, meanwhile Boruto was able to hold his own aganist kakashi.\n\n3.) Naruto worker to overcome that by sheer training and willpower. \n\nDo you not recall how motivated Naruto was to learn that jutsu and messed up he looked after learning the justu?",

Gentle Fist is a fighting form, you can know it without Byakugan, but he won\u2019t be disabling any chakra points without it. (This is shown when he uses open palm stikes) \n\n2.) Not sure why Kakashi woulda said that, when him and and Obito were using elementals as genin, he was prolly referring to all the other Genin he was training before. It\u2019s not rare for Genin to know elemental jutsu, just all of the main characters from the Naruto era specialized in their clan jutsu, which is arguably more useful than elemental jutsu. Kakashi also said he\u2019s gotten soft we than he used to be at the end of the test arc too.\n\n3.) ok? Good for Naruto? Part of Borutos whole arc is to find what to work towards when everything is seemingly given to him.

Gentle Fist is a fighting form, you can know it without Byakugan, but he won\u2019t be disabling any chakra points without it. (This is shown when he uses open palm stikes) \n\n2.) Not sure why Kakashi woulda said that, when him and and Obito were using elementals as genin, he was prolly referring to all the other Genin he was training before. It\u2019s not rare for Genin to know elemental jutsu, just all of the main characters from the Naruto era specialized in their clan jutsu, which is arguably more useful than elemental jutsu. Kakashi also said he\u2019s gotten soft we than he used to be at the end of the test arc too.\n\n3.) ok? Good for Naruto? Part of Borutos whole arc is to find what to work towards when everything is seemingly given to him. (Which it isn\u2019t, he realizes this in the Chunin exams and cheats multiple times because  he is desperate.)",

I lean more torwards Sarada.\n\n2.) Uzumaki do have both, but Boruto didn't seem to inherit anything from the Uzumakis. He can only make a handful of clones and even without using the nine tails Naruto could make a thousand. But three nature transformations is too much even for a prodigy. Each of prodigies we saw before typically only had one, maybe two by the time they 13 or 14. \n\n3.) He also is just an unlikable person and seems more like a fanfiction character than a real character.\n\nYou're good, I understand.",
