    "body": "I don\u2019t have anywhere else to post this and have very few people in my life that understand my position. I am absolutely devastated and this was very out of the blue. \n\nPlease drop any words of wisdom, encouragement, or something uplifting. \n\nI feel like my world is quickly crashing down around me and I am absolutely shattered. We had made long term plans to be with one another and now I\u2019m questioning everything, like us not making enough time for one another while we had it.\n\nEdit:\nI may just keep adding to this to keep me from having a panic attack, it\u2019s kind of like word vomit at this point. We were supposed to play Augusta national in a few months, because he knew everyone and had the connections. We had looked at rings and both wanted to get married at the Ocean Club in the Bahamas. He had purchased property and we were developing plans to build a house on a lake we both loved. I hate this. Devastated doesn\u2019t even begin to describe this feeling in my heart. My life and world will never be the same.\n\nEdit 2:\nI\u2019m broken beyond belief that I never got to say goodbye. This was such a shitty time, because we\u2019d only seen each other three times since Valentine\u2019s Day. Too much social distancing bullshit. I never get to bask in his glow and warmth again. He was the type of man that made every person he came into contact with feel special and always told me \u201cit doesn\u2019t cost any extra to be kind.\u201d He helped me immensely while I was getting through law school, more emotionally than anything else. My mind is already wandering back to times in my little loft I had at school and me coming home from late class to find him cooking dinner. It felt so natural and so easy. Or the time he sent me to my 3.5 hr/once a week state civil procedure class with the strongest margarita I will ever drink. He would make breakfast and wake me with coffee every night he stayed over. Of course our relationship had its ups and downs, but when the going got tough, we tended to cling to each other. He was brilliant but not pretentious, loved to be on the water, and could get along with anyone. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m eulogizing him, I guess I\u2019m just getting things off my chest. As I lay here and listen to his quipped voicemails that I will now never delete, I\u2019m coming to the realization that this isn\u2019t some cruel joke, it\u2019s my new reality. Thanks for listening and reading my rambles. \ud83d\udda4",

Kept the letter until I feel ready to let go and burn them in the hope that it'll reach her.\n\nHealing will take time. Time will tell, so live life well. Be strong...\n\nAlthough he is no longer here, he will always live inside your heart, as long as you continue to remember and cherish the moments spent together. My heart goes out to you.",
