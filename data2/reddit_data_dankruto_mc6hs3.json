Chiyo remarked on how quickly Sakura picked up on Sasori's technique and didn't really need her help. Sakura wouldn't have been able to beat Sasori alone at that point but with Chiyo's help she performed better than anyone else in the Konoha 11 could have including Naruto .Hell Sakura actually saved herself from Sasori's poison gas cloud along with several other attacks. Sasori was immensely impressed by Sakura's ability to come up with an antidote for his poison and said he could not do that without referencing the ratio chart he used to create the damm thing. Sakura and Chiyo eventually talk no jutsu Sasori into letting himself be killed. \n\n\nAgain ten tails and that's not even mentioning the Sakuea novels which I didn't mention because I didn't read them and only know their highlights from youtube. But in the novel she tanks a fucking tailed beast bomb from one of Danzo's top henchmen.\n\nTell me what fight has Hinata one, and you include the anime filler as well.\n\nThe only things she has beaten were white Zetsu clones, a crystal clone of Gueren, and a single Juubi clone where she barely manages to complete the 64 palm.  \n\nSakura has a lot of problems with writing thanks to Kishi's frankly terrible understanding of women and love, but Hinata is objectively worse in that regard as she doesn't have a single moment that isn't related to Naruto.

In contrast Sakura at several scenes demonstrating her skill with medical ninjutsu and monstrous strength. Even excluding the Sasori fight. She frightens Kakashi with her strength, she has the best showing of the Konoha 11 barring Naruto in the fight aganist the the ten tails clones, when outsmarted multiple Jonin level medical nin when she deduces that Neji was actually a white Zetsu Clone, completely out classes literally every single sand medic in the sand village when saving Kankuro, and she surpassed Tsunade by the time of the fight aganist the ten tails.",

Chiyo remarked on how quickly Sakura picked up on Sasori's technique and didn't really need her help. Sakura wouldn't have been able to beat Sasori alone at that point but with Chiyo's help she performed better than anyone else in the Konoha 11 could have including Naruto .Hell Sakura actually saved herself from Sasori's poison gas cloud along with several other attacks. Sasori was immensely impressed by Sakura's ability to come up with an antidote for his poison and said he could not do that without referencing the ratio chart he used to create the damm thing. Sakura and Chiyo eventually talk no jutsu Sasori into letting himself be killed. \n\n\nAgain ten tails and that's not even mentioning the Sakuea novels which I didn't mention because I didn't read them and only know their highlights from youtube. But in the novel she tanks a fucking tailed beast bomb from one of Danzo's top henchmen.\n\nTell me what fight has Hinata one, and you include the anime filler as well.\n\nThe only things she has beaten were white Zetsu clones, a crystal clone of Gueren, and a single Juubi clone where she barely manages to complete the 64 palm.  \n\nSakura has a lot of problems with writing thanks to Kishi's frankly terrible understanding of women and love, but Hinata is objectively worse in that regard as she doesn't have a single moment that isn't related to Naruto. The only reason why people like her is because they like the idea of a woman who is completely submissive and subservient to man and has big tits.",

Sakura wouldn't have been able to beat Sasori alone at that point but with Chiyo's help she performed better than anyone else in the Konoha 11 could have including Naruto .Hell Sakura actually saved herself from Sasori's poison gas cloud along with several other attacks. Sasori was immensely impressed by Sakura's ability to come up with an antidote for his poison and said he could not do that without referencing the ratio chart he used to create the damm thing. Sakura and Chiyo eventually talk no jutsu Sasori into letting himself be killed. \n\n\nAgain ten tails and that's not even mentioning the Sakuea novels which I didn't mention because I didn't read them and only know their highlights from youtube. But in the novel she tanks a fucking tailed beast bomb from one of Danzo's top henchmen.\n\nTell me what fight has Hinata one, and you include the anime filler as well.\n\nThe only things she has beaten were white Zetsu clones, a crystal clone of Gueren, and a single Juubi clone where she barely manages to complete the 64 palm.  \n\nSakura has a lot of problems with writing thanks to Kishi's frankly terrible understanding of women and love, but Hinata is objectively worse in that regard as she doesn't have a single moment that isn't related to Naruto.

Chiyo remarked on how quickly Sakura picked up on Sasori's technique and didn't really need her help. Sakura wouldn't have been able to beat Sasori alone at that point but with Chiyo's help she performed better than anyone else in the Konoha 11 could have including Naruto .Hell Sakura actually saved herself from Sasori's poison gas cloud along with several other attacks. Sasori was immensely impressed by Sakura's ability to come up with an antidote for his poison and said he could not do that without referencing the ratio chart he used to create the damm thing. Sakura and Chiyo eventually talk no jutsu Sasori into letting himself be killed. \n\n\nAgain ten tails and that's not even mentioning the Sakuea novels which I didn't mention because I didn't read them and only know their highlights from youtube. But in the novel she tanks a fucking tailed beast bomb from one of Danzo's top henchmen.\n\nTell me what fight has Hinata one, and you include the anime filler as well.\n\nThe only things she has beaten were white Zetsu clones, a crystal clone of Gueren, and a single Juubi clone where she barely manages to complete the 64 palm.  \n\nSakura has a lot of problems with writing thanks to Kishi's frankly terrible understanding of women and love, but Hinata is objectively worse in that regard as she doesn't have a single moment that isn't related to Naruto.

Sakura wouldn't have been able to beat Sasori alone at that point but with Chiyo's help she performed better than anyone else in the Konoha 11 could have including Naruto .Hell Sakura actually saved herself from Sasori's poison gas cloud along with several other attacks. Sasori was immensely impressed by Sakura's ability to come up with an antidote for his poison and said he could not do that without referencing the ratio chart he used to create the damm thing. Sakura and Chiyo eventually talk no jutsu Sasori into letting himself be killed. \n\n\nAgain ten tails and that's not even mentioning the Sakuea novels which I didn't mention because I didn't read them and only know their highlights from youtube. But in the novel she tanks a fucking tailed beast bomb from one of Danzo's top henchmen.\n\nTell me what fight has Hinata one, and you include the anime filler as well.\n\nThe only things she has beaten were white Zetsu clones, a crystal clone of Gueren, and a single Juubi clone where she barely manages to complete the 64 palm.  \n\nSakura has a lot of problems with writing thanks to Kishi's frankly terrible understanding of women and love, but Hinata is objectively worse in that regard as she doesn't have a single moment that isn't related to Naruto. The only reason why people like her is because they like the idea of a woman who is completely submissive and subservient to man and has big tits.",

Chiyo remarked on how quickly Sakura picked up on Sasori's technique and didn't really need her help. Sakura wouldn't have been able to beat Sasori alone at that point but with Chiyo's help she performed better than anyone else in the Konoha 11 could have including Naruto .Hell Sakura actually saved herself from Sasori's poison gas cloud along with several other attacks. Sasori was immensely impressed by Sakura's ability to come up with an antidote for his poison and said he could not do that without referencing the ratio chart he used to create the damm thing. Sakura and Chiyo eventually talk no jutsu Sasori into letting himself be killed. \n\n\nAgain ten tails and that's not even mentioning the Sakuea novels which I didn't mention because I didn't read them and only know their highlights from youtube. But in the novel she tanks a fucking tailed beast bomb from one of Danzo's top henchmen.\n\nTell me what fight has Hinata one, and you include the anime filler as well.\n\nThe only things she has beaten were white Zetsu clones, a crystal clone of Gueren, and a single Juubi clone where she barely manages to complete the 64 palm.  \n\nSakura has a lot of problems with writing thanks to Kishi's frankly terrible understanding of women and love, but Hinata is objectively worse in that regard as she doesn't have a single moment that isn't related to Naruto. The only reason why people like her is because they like the idea of a woman who is completely submissive and subservient to man and has big tits.",
