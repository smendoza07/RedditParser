The person you\u2019re propositioning is certainly at liberty to say no, no matter what.\n\nImagine you are walking around downtown and someone demands 159 from you and then goes on an incoherent diatribe when you stare at them incredulously.

It's such an immature move to blame someone else for your mental state. If someone is treating you unwell, you stop interacting with them. Point blank period. This sugar daddy isn't \"making\" her crazy. If she feels like he is pushing her buttons, she should put on her big girl panties and LEAVE.\n\nThe more likely scenario here is she needs some quick cash, went down her list of contacts trying to solicit some pity money, and got frustrated that her plan didn't work. OP probably isn't the first or last person she will freak out on today. And of course he posted it here. That's kind of what this forum is all about. Sorry you're so bitter and jaded, hon.",

Watch her scramble to come up for an excuse why you can't do that and need to give the money to her. If there's any doubt in your mind this is real, call her bluff. If her pet needs help for real, she will accept your offer. But I bet you a cherry soda she's a lying scammer.",

The person you\u2019re propositioning is certainly at liberty to say no, no matter what.\n\nImagine you are walking around downtown and someone demands 159 from you and then goes on an incoherent diatribe when you stare at them incredulously.

It's such an immature move to blame someone else for your mental state. If someone is treating you unwell, you stop interacting with them. Point blank period. This sugar daddy isn't \"making\" her crazy. If she feels like he is pushing her buttons, she should put on her big girl panties and LEAVE.\n\nThe more likely scenario here is she needs some quick cash, went down her list of contacts trying to solicit some pity money, and got frustrated that her plan didn't work. OP probably isn't the first or last person she will freak out on today. And of course he posted it here. That's kind of what this forum is all about. Sorry you're so bitter and jaded, hon.",

Almost certainly there\u2019s no dog emergency. 159 covers literally no procedures\u2014maybe a checkup (80) and a vax update at best. My dog had a small cyst erupt and just having it cleaned out and 7 days of antibiotics was over 300. And why would she ask for 159 as a fraction of the cost?\n\nWhen you\u2019re asking someone for money or a favor it\u2019s on you to provide believable evidence and ask politely. The person you\u2019re propositioning is certainly at liberty to say no, no matter what.\n\nImagine you are walking around downtown and someone demands 159 from you and then goes on an incoherent diatribe when you stare at them incredulously. Are *you* handing out bills to every bum on the street who asks and has a sob story?",
