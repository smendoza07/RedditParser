It\u2019s mostly just fleshing out characters that the manga doesn\u2019t have time for because the manga only has time for Boruto, Kawaki, Naruto and Sasuke. \n\nThat said the anime has some pretty good arcs unique only to itself. That Sarada-Sakura-Sasuke training episode was lit. \n\nAnd the anime seems to be doing more with the Uchiha family dynamic with Sarada getting curious about MS and Sasuke and Sakura not wanting to tell her or let her know about Sasuke\u2019s past.",

The fact that experiencing loss, or just any intense emotional moment, empowers you is really interesting to me. The anime seemed to flip-flop between \"This ability is really a detriment as it tempts you to sacrifice your bonds\" and \"Look how COOL these Uchiha are for taking advantage of the Sharingan!\"\n\nYou are right, though. At the time they fought in the end it really was up to Naruto to solve things. I do think if Sasuke ruled with hate he'd breed a power that would usurp him eventually, Lordgenome from TTGL style.",
