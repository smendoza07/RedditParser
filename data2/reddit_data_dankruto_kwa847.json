I'll join that sub once I start boruto (yeah im actually gonna watch that, people say it's bad but let's see how it goes)",

I'll join that sub once I start boruto (yeah im actually gonna watch that, people say it's bad but let's see how it goes)",

I'll join that sub once I start boruto (yeah im actually gonna watch that, people say it's bad but let's see how it goes)",

I'll join that sub once I start boruto (yeah im actually gonna watch that, people say it's bad but let's see how it goes)",
