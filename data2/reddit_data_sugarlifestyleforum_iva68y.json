    "body": "Today I added the \\`Sugar Daddy\\` flair to my account. \n\nThat's right, I'm a sugar daddy now. And I love it.\n\nI'll probably say more later, including details on how well it seems to be going, but I just wanted to come out and say hello to the community. I've appreciated reading your posts and comments, and the \"Read Before Posting\" post was really helpful, as were the links in it, especially the \"Modern Sugar Relationship (MSR)\" post. It really smoothed things out as I got started, although I confess I ignored some of the guidelines, with mixed results. More later on that perhaps.\n\nSo yeah. Hi!",

He ended up being a gentleman and a lot of fun. I did do a lot of vetting beforehand and had his full name- so I don\u2019t suggest anyone doing the same if it\u2019s a complete stranger you know absolutely nothing about, but I\u2019m happy I went against so many rules here. Just have to be smart about it and trust your gut!",
