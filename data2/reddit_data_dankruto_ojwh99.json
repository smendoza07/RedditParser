The true purpose of the chakra tree was unknown even to him at that point, it was the aliens and black zetsu who had everyone fooled. Madara never knew that it would kill everyone and allow the otsutsuki to take over/consume earth\n\nDanzo didn't even want peace for all, he just wanted to rule over Konoha and \"protect\" Konoha, he didn't care if the rest of the world burned. He would even make sure the rest of the world burned and everyone else suffered just so he could ensure *his* Konoha comes out on top. \n\nMadara and Obito were examples of the end justify the means, the bigger picture, sacrifices have to be made type of blind ideology\n\n\nThe Uchiha duo in the final war were killing some to achieve their global peace to \"save\" the majority of everyone on the planet. Kill thousands to save millions. Ozymandias type beat. They knew they were being the the common enemy and how everyone just \"can't understand\" their misguided peace.\n\nDanzo wasn't that idealistic, he literally just thought Konoha was superior to all. Either Konoha ruled over the world or Konoha is the only kingdom left standing would be fine for him. \n\nThe difference between Danzo and Madara is obvious and that's why Danzo is the most hated villain because he was just an asshole to the core but Madara is somehow understood even if he got fucked up so bad along the way he became that",

In their eyes, they didn't do anything wrong and were being falsely accused. Why should they be the ones to show goodwill? That's the fault of Konoha for being suspicious of their own allies with no grounds and not even an investigation.

The true purpose of the chakra tree was unknown even to him at that point, it was the aliens and black zetsu who had everyone fooled. Madara never knew that it would kill everyone and allow the otsutsuki to take over/consume earth\n\nDanzo didn't even want peace for all, he just wanted to rule over Konoha and \"protect\" Konoha, he didn't care if the rest of the world burned. He would even make sure the rest of the world burned and everyone else suffered just so he could ensure *his* Konoha comes out on top. \n\nMadara and Obito were examples of the end justify the means, the bigger picture, sacrifices have to be made type of blind ideology\n\n\nThe Uchiha duo in the final war were killing some to achieve their global peace to \"save\" the majority of everyone on the planet. Kill thousands to save millions. Ozymandias type beat. They knew they were being the the common enemy and how everyone just \"can't understand\" their misguided peace.\n\nDanzo wasn't that idealistic, he literally just thought Konoha was superior to all. Either Konoha ruled over the world or Konoha is the only kingdom left standing would be fine for him. \n\nThe difference between Danzo and Madara is obvious and that's why Danzo is the most hated villain because he was just an asshole to the core but Madara is somehow understood even if he got fucked up so bad along the way he became that",

That's the fault of Konoha for being suspicious of their own allies with no grounds and not even an investigation\n\nUchiha couldn't know if one of them hadn't planned that shit. Danzo was harsh but the Uchiha showed zero tact in how to handle the situation. Danzo had accused them of having tried to attack the village and they did exactly did and proved Danzo 'right'.\n\n>If they were actually competent leaders, they'd know how to be diplomatic about it.\n\nSame to Fugaku. Both he and Danzo were trash politicians and human beings.",

The true purpose of the chakra tree was unknown even to him at that point, it was the aliens and black zetsu who had everyone fooled. Madara never knew that it would kill everyone and allow the otsutsuki to take over/consume earth\n\nDanzo didn't even want peace for all, he just wanted to rule over Konoha and \"protect\" Konoha, he didn't care if the rest of the world burned. He would even make sure the rest of the world burned and everyone else suffered just so he could ensure *his* Konoha comes out on top. \n\nMadara and Obito were examples of the end justify the means, the bigger picture, sacrifices have to be made type of blind ideology\n\n\nThe Uchiha duo in the final war were killing some to achieve their global peace to \"save\" the majority of everyone on the planet. Kill thousands to save millions. Ozymandias type beat. They knew they were being the the common enemy and how everyone just \"can't understand\" their misguided peace.\n\nDanzo wasn't that idealistic, he literally just thought Konoha was superior to all. Either Konoha ruled over the world or Konoha is the only kingdom left standing would be fine for him. \n\nThe difference between Danzo and Madara is obvious and that's why Danzo is the most hated villain because he was just an asshole to the core but Madara is somehow understood even if he got fucked up so bad along the way he became that",

He would even make sure the rest of the world burned and everyone else suffered just so he could ensure *his* Konoha comes out on top. \n\nMadara and Obito were examples of the end justify the means, the bigger picture, sacrifices have to be made type of blind ideology\n\n\nThe Uchiha duo in the final war were killing some to achieve their global peace to \"save\" the majority of everyone on the planet. Kill thousands to save millions. Ozymandias type beat. They knew they were being the the common enemy and how everyone just \"can't understand\" their misguided peace.\n\nDanzo wasn't that idealistic, he literally just thought Konoha was superior to all. Either Konoha ruled over the world or Konoha is the only kingdom left standing would be fine for him. \n\nThe difference between Danzo and Madara is obvious and that's why Danzo is the most hated villain because he was just an asshole to the core but Madara is somehow understood even if he got fucked up so bad along the way he became that",

The true purpose of the chakra tree was unknown even to him at that point, it was the aliens and black zetsu who had everyone fooled. Madara never knew that it would kill everyone and allow the otsutsuki to take over/consume earth\n\nDanzo didn't even want peace for all, he just wanted to rule over Konoha and \"protect\" Konoha, he didn't care if the rest of the world burned. He would even make sure the rest of the world burned and everyone else suffered just so he could ensure *his* Konoha comes out on top. \n\nMadara and Obito were examples of the end justify the means, the bigger picture, sacrifices have to be made type of blind ideology\n\n\nThe Uchiha duo in the final war were killing some to achieve their global peace to \"save\" the majority of everyone on the planet. Kill thousands to save millions. Ozymandias type beat. They knew they were being the the common enemy and how everyone just \"can't understand\" their misguided peace.\n\nDanzo wasn't that idealistic, he literally just thought Konoha was superior to all. Either Konoha ruled over the world or Konoha is the only kingdom left standing would be fine for him. \n\nThe difference between Danzo and Madara is obvious and that's why Danzo is the most hated villain because he was just an asshole to the core but Madara is somehow understood even if he got fucked up so bad along the way he became that",

Given Hanzo's paranoia, it makes sense that from the start he didn't trust the Akatsuki (which is how the manga presents it) rather than having him trust the Akatsuki and Danzo going out of his way to mess things up.",
