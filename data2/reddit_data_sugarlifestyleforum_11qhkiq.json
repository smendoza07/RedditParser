    "body": "What part of sugaring suggests that women are willingly going to give you their home address and allow you to come over?\n\nDo men realize when they ask this within the first few moments of the conversation, that they are suggesting they are only interested in defiling us and not in taking us out, getting to know us, or being seen in public?\n\nThe only woman who would agree with this is not aligned so much with having a sugar relationship - are they?  It reeks of behavior that does not honor the other attributes a woman can bring to the sugar dynamic.\n\nThe question alone incenses me too much to even continue the conversation with a POT SD.",

I will not host a potential abuser (all men are potential abusers) and I will not endanger a kind and well meaning man by having him in my home.  My sanctuary is *my* sanctuary - and unless the guy is paying the entirety of my rent and is single, he is not coming anywhere near my home.  \n\nBesides - if he is married and his OPSEC game is weak, you could be on the receiving end of a psycho wife if and when he gets himself caught.  \n\nNo thank you.",

They spend it because what the experience/item/person they spend it on is *worth it*.\n\n I don't find spending money on hotels to be *worth it* if the primary purpose of the hotel is to get sugar from a distant SB.

We could go out for dates and then return to my hotel or luxury Airbnb.\n\nI've been retired from having an SB for four years now, but thinking about it again.  Except I don't travel consistently to any city so would need to find someone local.  My main problem is not having any electronic records of where I've been, like hotel stays in my city.  I would be uncomfortable having the first couple of initimate meets be in my house or her house, so I have to figure that out.  But it would be so much easier in the long run to do if eventually she could host.  And I would be more than willing to offer my normal PPM plus the cost of a nice hotel, and she could choose whether to go the hotel option and book it herself or to host.  Is this a non-starter for most SB's?",

They spend it because what the experience/item/person they spend it on is *worth it*.\n\n I don't find spending money on hotels to be *worth it* if the primary purpose of the hotel is to get sugar from a distant SB.

They spend it because what the experience/item/person they spend it on is *worth it*.\n\n I don't find spending money on hotels to be *worth it* if the primary purpose of the hotel is to get sugar from a distant SB.
