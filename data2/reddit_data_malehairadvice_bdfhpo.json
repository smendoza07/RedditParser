I'm not too sure about the spikes (those are the barber's doing) but I like the shorter cut and its way easier in the sweaty summer and for travelling.\n\nEDIT: my only problem now is recreating it with this volume. after a shower it currently looks very flat.",

If you MUST get an undercut, don't overdo it with the length you DO decide to keep, the length you have now on top is ideal, because that'll make the hair look that much more strange, like someone forgot to shave the rest of your head.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy the way, that's another thing, you have to be more alert about the length of the shaved part to keep things looking \"neat\". I say FUCK that shit. You can probably get away with a different haircut without having to touch up as much, but an undercut, line up is going to need probably weekly attention to look concise.",

If you MUST get an undercut, don't overdo it with the length you DO decide to keep, the length you have now on top is ideal, because that'll make the hair look that much more strange, like someone forgot to shave the rest of your head.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy the way, that's another thing, you have to be more alert about the length of the shaved part to keep things looking \"neat\". I say FUCK that shit. You can probably get away with a different haircut without having to touch up as much, but an undercut, line up is going to need probably weekly attention to look concise.",

If you MUST get an undercut, don't overdo it with the length you DO decide to keep, the length you have now on top is ideal, because that'll make the hair look that much more strange, like someone forgot to shave the rest of your head.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy the way, that's another thing, you have to be more alert about the length of the shaved part to keep things looking \"neat\". I say FUCK that shit. You can probably get away with a different haircut without having to touch up as much, but an undercut, line up is going to need probably weekly attention to look concise.",
