So that puts him universal level. And that base Momoshiki proceeded to run away from Darui. His fused form was used as a ping pong ball in the manga.",

Borushiki with extremely low levels of Chakra and with limited access to his abilities and a damaged body can fight Code and easily overpower him, take out Sasuke, and easily shoot a bunch of giant rasengans, and overall be far more powerful than Sasuke and Naruto. Yet his ultimate form got taken down by an exhausted Naruto and Sasuke in the movie/manga/series. Boruto is less consistent than DB at its worst.",

The only reason they won was because of an asspull power up that was specifically thought of to hurt Isshiki (Naruto speeding up his time) and the shadow clone trick by a guy that literally learned it 1 week ago. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen there are the Shin clones who kept up with Naruto and Sasuke because they were rusty and forgot to recharge their Chakra.",

Boruto nerfed Naruto and Sasuke along with the old gen to make the new gen look good because they were \"too strong.\" Instead of meaningfully solving this issue they made it worse with Boruto and Kawaki's whole new powers like Karma, ninja tools, Cyborgs, etc. The power scaling is probably going to keep escalating now.\n\nThe show could have focused on Naruto's attempts to broker peace among the villages/nations and it could have focused on Boruto's life in this new era without war. The fights and stuff for him, would be lesser in scale as he would be just a kid.",

If you like it, that\u2019s cool, but I\u2019m not sure why you expect other fans to have the same opinions when the show has so many objectively glaring issues when compared to original Naruto, which also had glaring issues of its own but were made exceedingly worse in Boruto.",

Most of the time they shit on new gens fandoms. I can understand why u guys shit on the jjk fandom they compare each and everything with Naruto and say how bad it is and jjk is better.Like wtf these guys compare animes like how asian moms compare their kids. Not only that this fandom says how the boruto fandom is toxic meanwhile sending death threats to kishimoto for ships and kuramas death. I shit u not there is a guy called tonydavis something like that he framed the Boruto sub by posting on the sub of a guys picture saying how he is looking for a gf . He deleted that post after taking a screenshot and posted on r/dankruto saying the face of the Boruto sub. Everyone believed his bitch so i took a screenshot and asked the Boruto sub. So one of them took the screenshot of the post before he deleted in the Boruto sub.",

Anything, you'd know that the universe is always expanding. \n\nAlso, we have to let everyone know why we are better. We, the Naruto Fandom as a whole, are not toxic. But when it comes to someone *disrespecting* our anime, we have to let them know how inferior they are. This is coming from someone who's in multiple Fandoms, some of which rival the Naruto one. Here's a poem I made \n\n When it comes to YouTube, one piece has the best Fandom\n\nWhen it comes to reddit, tis us \n\nBut no matter where you go, boruto sucks",

Narutos easily one of my favorite animes but that doesn't stop me from enjoying Boruto, or preferring other animes. You're as foolish as they come if you truly believe Naruto is superior to everything else in the realm of anime. At the end of the day, You're just a dick with a superiority complex",

IMO u can say shit about the Boruto anime however saying shit about the fandom is fucking bullshit just because they have different opinion. I myself like boruto and naruto.  Both shows has its flaws . Shit on the anime but don't shit on others who enjoy . Except the mha u can shit on them",

The teacher asked a single question and we're all wondering how the actual fuck Naruto is going to pass.  Then they have the forest of death, showing us that these kids are going out on life or death missions.  These kids are being to become/are trained killers.  The one v one fights were also intense.  Showing what each character was capable of and culminating character development before a huge plot twist where the one tails goes nuts and Orichimaru effects his plan to assassinate the Hokage AND SUCCEEDS.\n\nBoruto made this all a joke and he literally had two chances to do it right.  First time around we watch burrito smash through each test by cheating with a device that lets him use a jutsu that makes him win.  Then he gets caught by his own dad and shamed for using technology.  Oh, and they steal the whole assassinate the hokage thing from Naruto and try it again.\n\nSecond time around they do the forest of death but it's more like the forest of mild inconvenience.  Burrito literally failed this part but was given a free pass for being a good boy while in the original show kids were fucking murdering each other for a test.\nFinally the one v one shit happens and it's either really bad or really short.  Sarada vs fat girl should have just had Sarada one shot fat girl with chidori, the move her father used on garaa in the same exam.  Instead they slap fight for 15 minutes before they each decide to use their final move and Sarada wins.  Then burrito gets disqualified AGAIN because he didn't even bother to show up.\n\nTldr:  fuck Boruto completely.  Just look up all the major fights on YouTube because the great animation makes it worth seeing them.  Otherwise kill it with fire.",

Not only that this fandom says how the boruto fandom is toxic meanwhile sending death threats to kishimoto for ships and kuramas death. I shit u not there is a guy called tonydavis something like that he framed the Boruto sub by posting on the sub of a guys picture saying how he is looking for a gf . He deleted that post after taking a screenshot and posted on r/dankruto saying the face of the Boruto sub. Everyone believed his bitch so i took a screenshot and asked the Boruto sub. So one of them took the screenshot of the post before he deleted in the Boruto sub.",

Narutos easily one of my favorite animes but that doesn't stop me from enjoying Boruto, or preferring other animes. You're as foolish as they come if you truly believe Naruto is superior to everything else in the realm of anime. At the end of the day, You're just a dick with a superiority complex",

Unlike boruto though, it's actually good at the start, just doesn\u2019t fit in the current day. Like once you get to barratia (sanji) it gets insanely good with one of the best arcs of all time, arlong park. Sanjis arc is literally perfect, no flaws, just a little boring. But arlong park is literally top 5 arcs in one piece. \n\nOne piece is really good overall, but has burst of boringness.",

Not only that this fandom says how the boruto fandom is toxic meanwhile sending death threats to kishimoto for ships and kuramas death. I shit u not there is a guy called tonydavis something like that he framed the Boruto sub by posting on the sub of a guys picture saying how he is looking for a gf . He deleted that post after taking a screenshot and posted on r/dankruto saying the face of the Boruto sub. Everyone believed his bitch so i took a screenshot and asked the Boruto sub. So one of them took the screenshot of the post before he deleted in the Boruto sub.",

Narutos easily one of my favorite animes but that doesn't stop me from enjoying Boruto, or preferring other animes. You're as foolish as they come if you truly believe Naruto is superior to everything else in the realm of anime. At the end of the day, You're just a dick with a superiority complex",

Both shows has its flaws . Shit on the anime but don't shit on others who enjoy . Except the mha u can shit on them",

Code is supposedly way way more powerful than Jigen that Jigen kept putting limiters on him because Jigen knew he stood no chance, and even with all those limiters he was still on Jigen's level. Same Code that is getting wrecked by Borushiki and his omnipresent ally told him he stands no chance against (the exhausted, out of chakra) possessed Boruto. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLets also not forgot that Ishiki was destroyed by base Kaguya and couldn't heal or do anything for a thousand years, yet he could easily take out Naruto and Sasuke who kept up with her at her full power. The only reason they won was because of an asspull power up that was specifically thought of to hurt Isshiki (Naruto speeding up his time) and the shadow clone trick by a guy that literally learned it 1 week ago. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen there are the Shin clones who kept up with Naruto and Sasuke because they were rusty and forgot to recharge their Chakra.",

If you like it, that\u2019s cool, but I\u2019m not sure why you expect other fans to have the same opinions when the show has so many objectively glaring issues when compared to original Naruto, which also had glaring issues of its own but were made exceedingly worse in Boruto.",

When they brought kishimoto back for a few episodes against momoshiki \n\n>Moving to the manga\u2014 art style change GARBAGE \n\n>Konohamaru is a scrub \n\n>NOTHING from naruto was genuinely built off of\u2014 the uchiha massacre that happened less than 30 years ago? WHY isn\u2019t that an aspect of Saradas character? \n\n>Orochimaru went from a terrorist to attending PTA meetings \n\n>we just couldn\u2019t let the old kage die they\u2019re still old people and they\u2019re drinking buddies \n\nThere\u2019s more but I\u2019ll summarize here \nIt isn\u2019t that I believe I\u2019m superior to you based on what you enjoy \n>you can like what you like \n\nIt\u2019s when the borutards try to pass it off as an objectively good show that I\u2019m like \u201cnah man it\u2019s trash\u201d \n\n>Saskue was hella nerfed this patch lmao",

If you like it, that\u2019s cool, but I\u2019m not sure why you expect other fans to have the same opinions when the show has so many objectively glaring issues when compared to original Naruto, which also had glaring issues of its own but were made exceedingly worse in Boruto.",

Also sasuke too! I'm angy.\n\n> we just couldn\u2019t let the old kage die they\u2019re still old people and they\u2019re drinking buddies \n\nNothing objective in it.

When they brought kishimoto back for a few episodes against momoshiki \n\n>Moving to the manga\u2014 art style change GARBAGE \n\n>Konohamaru is a scrub \n\n>NOTHING from naruto was genuinely built off of\u2014 the uchiha massacre that happened less than 30 years ago? WHY isn\u2019t that an aspect of Saradas character? \n\n>Orochimaru went from a terrorist to attending PTA meetings \n\n>we just couldn\u2019t let the old kage die they\u2019re still old people and they\u2019re drinking buddies \n\nThere\u2019s more but I\u2019ll summarize here \nIt isn\u2019t that I believe I\u2019m superior to you based on what you enjoy \n>you can like what you like \n\nIt\u2019s when the borutards try to pass it off as an objectively good show that I\u2019m like \u201cnah man it\u2019s trash\u201d \n\n>Saskue was hella nerfed this patch lmao",

If you like it, that\u2019s cool, but I\u2019m not sure why you expect other fans to have the same opinions when the show has so many objectively glaring issues when compared to original Naruto, which also had glaring issues of its own but were made exceedingly worse in Boruto.",

But arlong park is literally top 5 arcs in one piece. \n\nOne piece is really good overall, but has burst of boringness.",
