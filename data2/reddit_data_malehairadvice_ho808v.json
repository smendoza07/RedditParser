I always look for inspo on Google like (90s Men haircut/70s men hair) and look for longer hairstyles and just show that to the barber/stylist and say \"I want it like this\" and guide him along the way. Also, many dudes don't want to acknowledge this, but a good shampoo and conditioner really help with styling your hair and making it look less awkward! lol",

I always look for inspo on Google like (90s Men haircut/70s men hair) and look for longer hairstyles and just show that to the barber/stylist and say \"I want it like this\" and guide him along the way. Also, many dudes don't want to acknowledge this, but a good shampoo and conditioner really help with styling your hair and making it look less awkward! lol",

Also, many dudes don't want to acknowledge this, but a good shampoo and conditioner really help with styling your hair and making it look less awkward! lol",
