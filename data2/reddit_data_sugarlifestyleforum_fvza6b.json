    "body": "I feel like the friends that give you a hard time about sugaring are always the first ones to be like \u201cthrow me something on your wishlist next time\u201d or \u201ccan you connect me with someone for a job ect...\u201d or \u201ctake me on vacation with you\u201d \n\nThe second they find out \u201che bought you what?!\u201d Or \u201c he connected you with who!?!?\u201d Or \u201che brought you where!?\u201d \n\n(Saying this in a light hearted joking way but true lol. Still love my friends that give me a hard time about sugaring.) \ud83d\udc9c\n\nEdit: very unfortunate to hear how some people are treated. In life people will always try to knock you down no matter what it is. So FUCK EM. \nI\u2019m grateful for my friends even the ones who give me a hard time and make dumb jokes towards me about it. If you can\u2019t laugh at yourself what\u2019s the point? \nI\u2019m a ball buster and all my closes friends are too. Im a firm believer if you can\u2019t take the heat step out of the kitchen!!! \nI\u2019m an open book to my closest friends and if anyone I didn\u2019t know personally asked me questions I\u2019m as honest as I can be.",

To them this is very \u201cout of character\u201d for me which I agree with in some ways. Sugaring has allowed me to expand me horizons and explore my sexuality in ways that have helped me grow so much as a person. It\u2019s pushed me out of my shell and given me experiences that I will always cherish. \n\nI used to tell them about issues I had in sugaring but now I just tell the friends I have made on here because they understand 100% where I\u2019m coming from because they have been through it themselves. \n\nIt\u2019s not all bad though. My ex sd bought my best friends Christmas presents which I thought was sweet gesture. He also invited them out with us on multiple occasions but was sadly shut down because \u201cwho wants to party with an old guy\u201d they said. Sometimes I wish they would understand but I feel like they won\u2019t unless they are in the bowl themselves.",

A relationship takes nurturing, care, love at times, and a SR definitely isnt \u201cfree money\u201d being thrown around. \n\nI personally dont tell my friends, they can barely accept the fact that I choose to see older men",

If I was on that site I'd just want to get paid but not actually sleep with anyone.\"\n\nI imagine that's what a lot of women feel about sugaring or any kind of sex for money situation. They wouldn't mind the money but sleeping with someone in that situation just doesn't sit well with them.\n\nMakes you appreciate the ones that do so enthusiastically even more.",

The most hilarious thing is where she asked me to buy her Gucci sneaker on her birthday and when I said I dont have money, she told me to ask my SD to buy her shoes. I laughed until my stomach hurts and I told her maybe she can ask him herself, and see how would he react. He probably would give her a polite, funny  rejection reply \ud83e\udd23\nShe is going back to her country soon, i told her that might buy her Tiffany\u2019s silver for her.
