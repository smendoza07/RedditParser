    "body": "I have to contact the mother of the depressed, suicidal, baby I love.\n\nBackstory... I met a college sugar baby 2 and a half years ago.  Beautiful and lost, the kind of girl that simply steals your heart before you even know.  Depressed, abandonment issues, probably a borderline personality disorder.  She was always unpredictable and really just a terrible \"sugar baby\", so, it didn't last.  It barely even started, but the emotional part was there regardless.  We split, and no communication for about a year.  Then she reaches out.  \"She's more mature now, needs me, wants to try again.\"  Well, since I still love her, we try again.  This time, 3 months of the worst arrangement in the history of arrangements, and I have to pull the plug again.  But she is sincerely lost, and depressed and needs guidance and anyone, someone in her life to care for her.  Her family has moved across the country, she's alone.  So.. we continue to talk on occasion.  Grab a dinner here and there, but nothing more than that.  Fall semester of what we hope is her final senior year (anyone heard of the 6 year plan) and she can't pay for it.  Surrogate no-sugar Daddy gives her a loan, yeah I know, she's never going to pay it back.  She struggles through the semester.  \n\nThen Friday morning, I get the text.  \"Crashed my car, in jail, help me\". Of course, she doesn't respond to further texts or calls.  (Did I mention she holds a planetary achievement for terrible communication).  I have no idea where she is.  So.. I wait.  2 hours later, the police department calls, asks if I know said female, then puts her in the phone.  She asks if I can come and get her.  I'm 2 hours drive away I tell her I can be there in 2 hours.  She says forget it, she'll get someone else.  I reach out to a girl, aka my most recent sugar baby, who's in the next town and ask if she can get trainwreck girl.  She calls the police station and is told someone else is on the way.  But plus one for the sugar sisterhood, she tried.\n\nTrainwreck girl gets home, room in shared house near campus, and texts me that she'll call me.  Refuses to answer phone.  Finally.. the next night, calls me.  She's super depressed and suicidal, her car was her everything, her sanctuary, and its gone, devastation.  Oh, I bought it for her, btw.  \"We can get a new one.\" i say.  She tells me I don't understand and hangs up.  This goes on through 4 abbreviated phone calls.  I tell her I'm going to get her.  She tells me all the terrible drugs she's going to use to kill herself, tells me she won't see me.  Then tells me to get her.  Back and forth.  Fucking Trainwreck.  30 minutes into my late night drive.. she tells me she won't see me, don't come.  It's too much.  I know I can't help her.  I contact her mother through venmo.  Yeah.. it's the only way I could find her, leaving a message that her daughter is suicidal.  \n\nToday, I wake up to emails sent in my sleep.  She needs me to get her.  She's suicidal, she knows she needs me.  God.. heart wrenching.  I send the suicide hotline number to her.  Maybe she's still alive, probably, I don't know, but I can't do this shit.  She doesn't respond to any communication.\nI literally break down crying in the Staples parking lot.  Like wtf!  \n\nHer mother finally reacts to my venmo message, I'm older than the mother, btw.   We communicate on Google voice, text.  I don't want to disclose more than I need to.  She's on the phone with her daughter, she's alive.  I tell the mother about the drugs her daughter is on.  Apparently she didn't know.  I hope she's going to get the help she seriously needs now.  But I don't know, the mother is an anti-medicine, antivaxer, psychiatrists are evil.  Fingers crossed.\n\nSo.. my duty is done.  Who knows what the fallout will be.  The price of being a sugar daddy is sometimes heavier than we thought we could afford.\n\nEdit1: Thank you everyone for your thoughts and concerns.  It gives me hope, knowing that we're all humans with care for each other, that we have this community, not to just debate paid meet and greets, but to help each other as well.  I'm hoping she will get the help she needs finally.  I'll probably never see her again, and recognizing that her health is worth my heartache.  Fingers crossed.",

Sure we all want to help fellow humans but it depends on how fall into your circle of life. A former SB,  train wreck, nope. Actually I screen for mental stability and I don\u2019t let SB\u2019s who can\u2019t give me that gut comfort.\n\nWhere is the catch! Everywhere. This lady will repeat this many times in her life over and over again. Each time she runs into trouble, she will call you. When the tornado passes she will forget you. What it will do to you is wreck you up mentally. Not worth it.\n\nYou ought to treat this like an incident on the freeway where you witness an accident, stay in to help until help arrives and then walk away for good.",

When dealing romantically with people who have serious mental health issues, it is a NEVER-ending unpredictable cycle. (Been there done that - won't do it again. Had a bipolar ex when vanilla dating and grew up with a sibling with BPD).",

I\u2019m not saying everyone has to go to these lengths or do anything, but when you help someone, it\u2019s a fantastic feeling. Just knowing she\u2019s alive, not in jail, & has a chance is wonderful.  \n\nHe did it because it was the right thing to do & he cares about her, not to find meaning. What \u2018meaning\u2019 is there in unoriginally just looking out for yourself? Some people treat others the way they would like to be treated.  They don\u2019t think- hmm, would this (apparently mentally ill or substance abuser) person do this for me? No, well I shouldn\u2019t help them. \n\nI enjoy being around the first group much more.
