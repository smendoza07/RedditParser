    "body": "I want to address something that happened on the sub yesterday. I'm not quite sure how often this has occurred in the past since I don't read all the profile review threads.\n\n\n**Guidelines for reviews:**\n\n* The profile reviews are not about your personal preferences. No one cares if the person asking for a review is your type or not.\n\n* It is not an opportunity for you to shit all over some one who didn't ask you if their body type, race, sexual orientation, etc. would be a detriment to their success in this lifestyle. \n\n* If you can't offer unbiased information then keep your virtual mouth shut and move along. Meaning, no matter the quality of the the content/pictures being asked to be reviewed, that you can't give honest and or positive feedback because the person is not your type even though you would if the same profile was posted by someone who was, then you shouldn't be participating on that post. Your opinion is of no value and should be kept to yourself. \n\n* Constructive criticism of the quality of the pictures, angles, type of pictures, the setting of the pictures, the outfit worn in the picture is acceptable. Guessing their fucking BMI and posting stats about how many men find them unattractive is not. \n\n\nThe fact that I have to address this at all is disappointing. It's one thing to do this when someone creates a post specifically asking about their chances as a _____ person. And quite another to do it in a profile review thread. If I see it I'm banning outright. \n\nTo all the people who give generously of their time and knowledge on these thread to help these individuals out, Thank you. I know from personal experience that sometimes it's not always well received.",

                    "body": "> If going through this sub has taught me anything it's that successful SBs and SDs come in all types. \n\nI'd like to tack onto this, if I may. \n\nWe all have different expectations of the \"perfect\" SR. If someone is asking for a profile review they probably have an idea of what they want, but likely haven't been in an SR before. Someone else's success in the bowl is likely not the same as mine. I have an above average allowance but I'm not luxury lifestyle by any means. That might be \"success\" to some, and to others that might be \"lol it's not sugar her SD didn't get her first class for an hour long flight what a loser.\" \n\nSince everyone needs, expectations, and overall experiences **are** different I think it's important to ask the OP of profiles asking for review explain their perspective on what they want from joining the bowl. A profile of a girl who just wants a vanilla relationship with minimal support vs a girl who expects to have a condo bought for her and be a mistress are going to be 2 very different profiles, if the OP is serious in attracting their respective target audience. **Arguing about their goals being different than yours accomplishes nothing**. It isn't constructive, and your criticisms of the state of the bowl are *irrelevant*. Newsflash: sugar is way more mainstream now than it was even 5 years ago. The \"others\" aren't leaving. All you can do is try to help everyone so that they easily identify, they can find their matches and you can find yours. Just like any other social circle where a mix of expectations and outcomes are present.",

I see expensive (by my standards) art that I would pay a substantial amount to have removed from my walls while others love it. I'll have guests look at something I have  and make statements like \"you really paid for that\".  Value is in the eye of the beholder. \n\nWe can help by identifying those elements we see in a profile that could be modified to appeal to a broader or perhaps more upscale segment of the SD population.   The little bunny whiskers are a great example as they may be very cool to the 25yo self proclaimed SD but a negative for most over 30.  \n\nAt the opposite end of the scale there may be things that an SB hinted at that are likely to broaden her appeal like education, sports participation, interests etc.  Others may provide a classy ( or not so classy) attraction to kink.  Several years ago one of the SB asking for a profile review was asked (based on a hint in her profile) if she was kink friendly and answered that it was a major plus for her.  A little find tuning and she was suddenly turning away pot SD .  \n\nOk this was a special case as she was accessible from DC which seems to be filled with folks having strange tastes but lots of disposable income . \n\nWe can help by looking for opportunities they may have missed or information they may have failed to provide in addition to offering comments on what should be deleted.",

Are your photos clear and free of filters? Do you have more than 1 photo? These are all basic. But if you're looking for a certain audience far outside the norm, build your profile *specifically* to attract them. Give advice to the OP that matches their specific vision, not what *you* want in *your* SR. A single mom of two wants to attract people who respect her schedule and know she isn't always going to be able to have a date at the drop of a hat. Telling her she needs to have more language alluding to working around an SDs schedule doesn't help her.",

You can tell someone it's possible but might not be probable instead of don't try at all. \n\nFor every person who post a picture on reddit that I personally find unattractive there are plenty of people lined up to tell them they are stunning or just their type. Now if I told that individual not try at all because I didn't find them attractive they would've missed out on those who thought they were stunning.\n\n And the biggest reason why I won't tell them not try is because I don't give a shit. How does their trying affect my life or experience? Why the need for so many to go out of their way to \"help\" them not waste their time?",

Then its filled with more comments of positive encouragement.\n\nAnd there should be, provided the OP took and applied the **constructive** criticism. Bad luck should absolutely be countered with positive encouragement. \n\nIf the OP is a black sugar baby asking why 1) she hasn't had much luck months after her profile review, writing a comment about a POF study about how \"a majority of men rank black women as least desirable\" is not constructive criticism. If that's the full extent of the content offered in the comment, it 1) isn't constructive and 2) isn't criticism. It's even a stretch to call it a fact when applying the data to sugaring (which is **not** vanilla dating.) \n\nI believe LaSirene's post was more about circumstances fitting something similar to the above description, rather than telling us all to blindly support anyone with \"well sugar comes in all shapes and sizes\", and (my least favorite phrase) \"there's someone in the bowl for everyone\".",

Telling a male SB, low income SD or a BBW SB to improve their profile is counterproductive. They need to work on the underlying issues that will make them more attractive instead of the better camera angles and fluff on their profile. \n\nIf I was looking for a job, and my skills & experience weren\u2019t up to the task, I should be told to learn some skills and get experience for the the job rather than fluffing up my resume. \n\nBut if I did have the skills and experience but my resume didn\u2019t reflect that well, then I would need help fixing my resume.",

Someone saying I know others are saying you're beautiful but let me be honest with you it looks like you have a BMI of 40 and the majority of men are not attracted to that and here are stats proving how unattractive people find you is not subjective. And that's what happened yesterday. \n\nShe didn't ask about her body shape or what people think her chances are. She ask for help with her profile and how to improve it.

So whether or not you *asked* it's her job to judge comments lol. She's a human being and given all the absolutely stupid, snippy comments that La Sirene (and the rest of the mod team reads) some sass back is expected. They all do it. ThisIsNotMyHandle is doing it several comments up. Malibi did it to me the other day. They all get snippy occasionally and guess what? They deserve to. Second of all, your comment didn't call for exclusion. It's a public forum my dude. If you don't want certain people to respond, take it to a DM or message the mod team directly. \n\nYou seemed really upset, so as a neutral party I figured I'd try to explain since I think you're taking the comment as an insult to you as a person instead of how you're *acting*. But if you just need to have a temper tantrum, that's fine too. Just don't expect anyone to want to participate in your discussions when you feel like having them (since apparently we're all supposed to know how to magically know when you feel like having public discussions when posting....in a public place.)",

If someone is asking for a profile review they probably have an idea of what they want, but likely haven't been in an SR before. Someone else's success in the bowl is likely not the same as mine. I have an above average allowance but I'm not luxury lifestyle by any means. That might be \"success\" to some, and to others that might be \"lol it's not sugar her SD didn't get her first class for an hour long flight what a loser.\" \n\nSince everyone needs, expectations, and overall experiences **are** different I think it's important to ask the OP of profiles asking for review explain their perspective on what they want from joining the bowl. A profile of a girl who just wants a vanilla relationship with minimal support vs a girl who expects to have a condo bought for her and be a mistress are going to be 2 very different profiles, if the OP is serious in attracting their respective target audience. **Arguing about their goals being different than yours accomplishes nothing**. It isn't constructive, and your criticisms of the state of the bowl are *irrelevant*. Newsflash: sugar is way more mainstream now than it was even 5 years ago. The \"others\" aren't leaving. All you can do is try to help everyone so that they easily identify, they can find their matches and you can find yours.

I see expensive (by my standards) art that I would pay a substantial amount to have removed from my walls while others love it. I'll have guests look at something I have  and make statements like \"you really paid for that\".  Value is in the eye of the beholder. \n\nWe can help by identifying those elements we see in a profile that could be modified to appeal to a broader or perhaps more upscale segment of the SD population.   The little bunny whiskers are a great example as they may be very cool to the 25yo self proclaimed SD but a negative for most over 30.  \n\nAt the opposite end of the scale there may be things that an SB hinted at that are likely to broaden her appeal like education, sports participation, interests etc.  Others may provide a classy ( or not so classy) attraction to kink.  Several years ago one of the SB asking for a profile review was asked (based on a hint in her profile) if she was kink friendly and answered that it was a major plus for her.  A little find tuning and she was suddenly turning away pot SD .  \n\nOk this was a special case as she was accessible from DC which seems to be filled with folks having strange tastes but lots of disposable income . \n\nWe can help by looking for opportunities they may have missed or information they may have failed to provide in addition to offering comments on what should be deleted.",

My experience with organized single mothers is that they are great organizers and time managers.  Yes there an occasional crisis,  baby sitter does not show   or flu does show.  In the  profile I think it's good to mention but also that she's got a reliable sitter so that the SD who likes to plan ahead will be comfortable but the one who wants to call at random and expects to meet does not waste her time.  To me it is managing your unique characteristics to help pot  SD self select.",

It doesn't matter if he got an interview or not. In fact, in my mind, my NBA hopeful *didn't* have an interview scheduled. It was all speculative. You could even call it fantasy. Doesn't matter.

You can tell someone it's possible but might not be probable instead of don't try at all. \n\nFor every person who post a picture on reddit that I personally find unattractive there are plenty of people lined up to tell them they are stunning or just their type. Now if I told that individual not try at all because I didn't find them attractive they would've missed out on those who thought they were stunning.\n\n And the biggest reason why I won't tell them not try is because I don't give a shit. How does their trying affect my life or experience? Why the need for so many to go out of their way to \"help\" them not waste their time?",

Bad luck should absolutely be countered with positive encouragement. \n\nIf the OP is a black sugar baby asking why 1) she hasn't had much luck months after her profile review, writing a comment about a POF study about how \"a majority of men rank black women as least desirable\" is not constructive criticism. If that's the full extent of the content offered in the comment, it 1) isn't constructive and 2) isn't criticism. It's even a stretch to call it a fact when applying the data to sugaring (which is **not** vanilla dating.) \n\nI believe LaSirene's post was more about circumstances fitting something similar to the above description, rather than telling us all to blindly support anyone with \"well sugar comes in all shapes and sizes\", and (my least favorite phrase) \"there's someone in the bowl for everyone\".",

Then why does he post his before and after pics? He posted them because he wanted praise for his accomplishment, and people telling him he's way more attractive. And he should because that's some serious fucking dedication.\n\nEdit: lasirene23 got pissed and banned me after she threw insults LMAOOOOOO",

So whether or not you *asked* it's her job to judge comments lol. She's a human being and given all the absolutely stupid, snippy comments that La Sirene (and the rest of the mod team reads) some sass back is expected. They all do it. ThisIsNotMyHandle is doing it several comments up. Malibi did it to me the other day. They all get snippy occasionally and guess what? They deserve to. Second of all, your comment didn't call for exclusion. It's a public forum my dude. If you don't want certain people to respond, take it to a DM or message the mod team directly. \n\nYou seemed really upset, so as a neutral party I figured I'd try to explain since I think you're taking the comment as an insult to you as a person instead of how you're *acting*. But if you just need to have a temper tantrum, that's fine too. Just don't expect anyone to want to participate in your discussions when you feel like having them (since apparently we're all supposed to know how to magically know when you feel like having public discussions when posting....in a public place.)",

I see expensive (by my standards) art that I would pay a substantial amount to have removed from my walls while others love it. I'll have guests look at something I have  and make statements like \"you really paid for that\".  Value is in the eye of the beholder. \n\nWe can help by identifying those elements we see in a profile that could be modified to appeal to a broader or perhaps more upscale segment of the SD population.   The little bunny whiskers are a great example as they may be very cool to the 25yo self proclaimed SD but a negative for most over 30.  \n\nAt the opposite end of the scale there may be things that an SB hinted at that are likely to broaden her appeal like education, sports participation, interests etc.  Others may provide a classy ( or not so classy) attraction to kink.  Several years ago one of the SB asking for a profile review was asked (based on a hint in her profile) if she was kink friendly and answered that it was a major plus for her.  A little find tuning and she was suddenly turning away pot SD .  \n\nOk this was a special case as she was accessible from DC which seems to be filled with folks having strange tastes but lots of disposable income . \n\nWe can help by looking for opportunities they may have missed or information they may have failed to provide in addition to offering comments on what should be deleted.",

Are your photos clear and free of filters? Do you have more than 1 photo? These are all basic. But if you're looking for a certain audience far outside the norm, build your profile *specifically* to attract them. Give advice to the OP that matches their specific vision, not what *you* want in *your* SR. A single mom of two wants to attract people who respect her schedule and know she isn't always going to be able to have a date at the drop of a hat. Telling her she needs to have more language alluding to working around an SDs schedule doesn't help her.",

You can tell someone it's possible but might not be probable instead of don't try at all. \n\nFor every person who post a picture on reddit that I personally find unattractive there are plenty of people lined up to tell them they are stunning or just their type. Now if I told that individual not try at all because I didn't find them attractive they would've missed out on those who thought they were stunning.\n\n And the biggest reason why I won't tell them not try is because I don't give a shit. How does their trying affect my life or experience? Why the need for so many to go out of their way to \"help\" them not waste their time?",

Bad luck should absolutely be countered with positive encouragement. \n\nIf the OP is a black sugar baby asking why 1) she hasn't had much luck months after her profile review, writing a comment about a POF study about how \"a majority of men rank black women as least desirable\" is not constructive criticism. If that's the full extent of the content offered in the comment, it 1) isn't constructive and 2) isn't criticism. It's even a stretch to call it a fact when applying the data to sugaring (which is **not** vanilla dating.) \n\nI believe LaSirene's post was more about circumstances fitting something similar to the above description, rather than telling us all to blindly support anyone with \"well sugar comes in all shapes and sizes\", and (my least favorite phrase) \"there's someone in the bowl for everyone\".",

Telling a male SB, low income SD or a BBW SB to improve their profile is counterproductive. They need to work on the underlying issues that will make them more attractive instead of the better camera angles and fluff on their profile. \n\nIf I was looking for a job, and my skills & experience weren\u2019t up to the task, I should be told to learn some skills and get experience for the the job rather than fluffing up my resume. \n\nBut if I did have the skills and experience but my resume didn\u2019t reflect that well, then I would need help fixing my resume.",

So whether or not you *asked* it's her job to judge comments lol. She's a human being and given all the absolutely stupid, snippy comments that La Sirene (and the rest of the mod team reads) some sass back is expected. They all do it. ThisIsNotMyHandle is doing it several comments up. Malibi did it to me the other day. They all get snippy occasionally and guess what? They deserve to. Second of all, your comment didn't call for exclusion. It's a public forum my dude. If you don't want certain people to respond, take it to a DM or message the mod team directly. \n\nYou seemed really upset, so as a neutral party I figured I'd try to explain since I think you're taking the comment as an insult to you as a person instead of how you're *acting*. But if you just need to have a temper tantrum, that's fine too. Just don't expect anyone to want to participate in your discussions when you feel like having them (since apparently we're all supposed to know how to magically know when you feel like having public discussions when posting....in a public place.)",

Are your photos clear and free of filters? Do you have more than 1 photo? These are all basic. But if you're looking for a certain audience far outside the norm, build your profile *specifically* to attract them. Give advice to the OP that matches their specific vision, not what *you* want in *your* SR. A single mom of two wants to attract people who respect her schedule and know she isn't always going to be able to have a date at the drop of a hat. Telling her she needs to have more language alluding to working around an SDs schedule doesn't help her.",

Bad luck should absolutely be countered with positive encouragement. \n\nIf the OP is a black sugar baby asking why 1) she hasn't had much luck months after her profile review, writing a comment about a POF study about how \"a majority of men rank black women as least desirable\" is not constructive criticism. If that's the full extent of the content offered in the comment, it 1) isn't constructive and 2) isn't criticism.

They need to work on the underlying issues that will make them more attractive instead of the better camera angles and fluff on their profile. \n\nIf I was looking for a job, and my skills & experience weren\u2019t up to the task, I should be told to learn some skills and get experience for the the job rather than fluffing up my resume. \n\nBut if I did have the skills and experience but my resume didn\u2019t reflect that well, then I would need help fixing my resume.",

So whether or not you *asked* it's her job to judge comments lol. She's a human being and given all the absolutely stupid, snippy comments that La Sirene (and the rest of the mod team reads) some sass back is expected. They all do it. ThisIsNotMyHandle is doing it several comments up. Malibi did it to me the other day. They all get snippy occasionally and guess what? They deserve to. Second of all, your comment didn't call for exclusion. It's a public forum my dude. If you don't want certain people to respond, take it to a DM or message the mod team directly. \n\nYou seemed really upset, so as a neutral party I figured I'd try to explain since I think you're taking the comment as an insult to you as a person instead of how you're *acting*. But if you just need to have a temper tantrum, that's fine too. Just don't expect anyone to want to participate in your discussions when you feel like having them (since apparently we're all supposed to know how to magically know when you feel like having public discussions when posting....in a public place.)",

Telling a male SB, low income SD or a BBW SB to improve their profile is counterproductive. They need to work on the underlying issues that will make them more attractive instead of the better camera angles and fluff on their profile. \n\nIf I was looking for a job, and my skills & experience weren\u2019t up to the task, I should be told to learn some skills and get experience for the the job rather than fluffing up my resume. \n\nBut if I did have the skills and experience but my resume didn\u2019t reflect that well, then I would need help fixing my resume.",

Not about the fact that author is fat. \n\n>  Look at BigBearSD, he gets so much praise on here because he made the effort to change his body type.\n\nHe did that because he wanted to not because people on the sub felt the need to tell him he was fat and unattractive when he didn't ask their opinion about his looks.",

Then why does he post his before and after pics? He posted them because he wanted praise for his accomplishment, and people telling him he's way more attractive. And he should because that's some serious fucking dedication.\n\nEdit: lasirene23 got pissed and banned me after she threw insults LMAOOOOOO",

So whether or not you *asked* it's her job to judge comments lol. She's a human being and given all the absolutely stupid, snippy comments that La Sirene (and the rest of the mod team reads) some sass back is expected. They all do it. ThisIsNotMyHandle is doing it several comments up. Malibi did it to me the other day. They all get snippy occasionally and guess what? They deserve to. Second of all, your comment didn't call for exclusion. It's a public forum my dude. If you don't want certain people to respond, take it to a DM or message the mod team directly. \n\nYou seemed really upset, so as a neutral party I figured I'd try to explain since I think you're taking the comment as an insult to you as a person instead of how you're *acting*. But if you just need to have a temper tantrum, that's fine too. Just don't expect anyone to want to participate in your discussions when you feel like having them (since apparently we're all supposed to know how to magically know when you feel like having public discussions when posting....in a public place.)",

So whether or not you *asked* it's her job to judge comments lol. She's a human being and given all the absolutely stupid, snippy comments that La Sirene (and the rest of the mod team reads) some sass back is expected. They all do it. ThisIsNotMyHandle is doing it several comments up. Malibi did it to me the other day. They all get snippy occasionally and guess what? They deserve to. Second of all, your comment didn't call for exclusion. It's a public forum my dude. If you don't want certain people to respond, take it to a DM or message the mod team directly. \n\nYou seemed really upset, so as a neutral party I figured I'd try to explain since I think you're taking the comment as an insult to you as a person instead of how you're *acting*. But if you just need to have a temper tantrum, that's fine too. Just don't expect anyone to want to participate in your discussions when you feel like having them (since apparently we're all supposed to know how to magically know when you feel like having public discussions when posting....in a public place.)",

So whether or not you *asked* it's her job to judge comments lol. She's a human being and given all the absolutely stupid, snippy comments that La Sirene (and the rest of the mod team reads) some sass back is expected. They all do it. ThisIsNotMyHandle is doing it several comments up. Malibi did it to me the other day. They all get snippy occasionally and guess what? They deserve to. Second of all, your comment didn't call for exclusion. It's a public forum my dude. If you don't want certain people to respond, take it to a DM or message the mod team directly. \n\nYou seemed really upset, so as a neutral party I figured I'd try to explain since I think you're taking the comment as an insult to you as a person instead of how you're *acting*. But if you just need to have a temper tantrum, that's fine too. Just don't expect anyone to want to participate in your discussions when you feel like having them (since apparently we're all supposed to know how to magically know when you feel like having public discussions when posting....in a public place.)",

You can tell someone it's possible but might not be probable instead of don't try at all. \n\nFor every person who post a picture on reddit that I personally find unattractive there are plenty of people lined up to tell them they are stunning or just their type. Now if I told that individual not try at all because I didn't find them attractive they would've missed out on those who thought they were stunning.\n\n And the biggest reason why I won't tell them not try is because I don't give a shit. How does their trying affect my life or experience? Why the need for so many to go out of their way to \"help\" them not waste their time?",

She's a human being and given all the absolutely stupid, snippy comments that La Sirene (and the rest of the mod team reads) some sass back is expected. They all do it. ThisIsNotMyHandle is doing it several comments up. Malibi did it to me the other day. They all get snippy occasionally and guess what? They deserve to. Second of all, your comment didn't call for exclusion. It's a public forum my dude. If you don't want certain people to respond, take it to a DM or message the mod team directly. \n\nYou seemed really upset, so as a neutral party I figured I'd try to explain since I think you're taking the comment as an insult to you as a person instead of how you're *acting*. But if you just need to have a temper tantrum, that's fine too. Just don't expect anyone to want to participate in your discussions when you feel like having them (since apparently we're all supposed to know how to magically know when you feel like having public discussions when posting....in a public place.)",

Don't go on people's profile reviews and tell them they shouldn't try because they are fat, unattractive, black, red purple or blue. There are bbw women who have found success in the bowl. Just because all of them won't doesn't mean they can't try. All the skinny pretty girls won't find one either. \n\n> Why do I say that? Because I\u2019ve seen that happen. I\u2019ve never seen an obese women find anything. \n\nBasing whether something is possible on whether you've personally experienced it is idiotic.
