Just 20 minutes out of one night/morning every week. Sometimes the episodes were really good, other times I'd forget what happened shortly after.\n\nLast year and a half I rewatched most of Naruto and Shippuden, and dear god it was painful. In my memories, I mostly just remembered the main events. Arcs I thought were short ended up being many, many hours, with over half being flashbacks. When you watch weekly, a flashback to something from an episode or two ago seems pretty fine, as it's not still fresh in my memory. Watching them back to back and seeing flashbacks to something you just saw 20 minutes ago is where it gets truly maddening.",

Just 20 minutes out of one night/morning every week. Sometimes the episodes were really good, other times I'd forget what happened shortly after.\n\nLast year and a half I rewatched most of Naruto and Shippuden, and dear god it was painful. In my memories, I mostly just remembered the main events. Arcs I thought were short ended up being many, many hours, with over half being flashbacks. When you watch weekly, a flashback to something from an episode or two ago seems pretty fine, as it's not still fresh in my memory. Watching them back to back and seeing flashbacks to something you just saw 20 minutes ago is where it gets truly maddening.",

Just 20 minutes out of one night/morning every week. Sometimes the episodes were really good, other times I'd forget what happened shortly after.\n\nLast year and a half I rewatched most of Naruto and Shippuden, and dear god it was painful. In my memories, I mostly just remembered the main events. Arcs I thought were short ended up being many, many hours, with over half being flashbacks. When you watch weekly, a flashback to something from an episode or two ago seems pretty fine, as it's not still fresh in my memory. Watching them back to back and seeing flashbacks to something you just saw 20 minutes ago is where it gets truly maddening.",
