Naruto straight up tells Iruka that he doesn't wanna be on Sasuke's team - and Sasuke isn't too happy either because he completely ignores both Naruto/Sakura afterwards. \n\nLater on, Naruto physically attacks Sasuke while he's eating and transforms into him. Sasuke goes to look for him - assumably to get back at him. Sakura's cruel remark reminded him of how similar he was to Naruto, and probably made him calm down about whatever Naruto did to him.",

I guarantee you, if Sasuke hadn\u2019t lost his family, he wouldve thought of Naruto the same way until he understood the pain of loneliness Naruto went through. The only reason why Sasuke reacted that way is because he related to Naruto, but if he didn\u2019t, he\u2019d have a similar snobby outlook to go w his superiority complex he\u2019d already had.\n\nAnd let\u2019s take a look at Neji, a notable asshole in part 1, yet y\u2019all don\u2019t give him shit just because how he was raised- yet how they were raised directly shaped how they treated others. Sakura being a normie and having a normie life and family shaped how she reacted to The correlation of Naruto\u2019s behavior and his absence of parents. She cannot relate to the pain of not having parents (as many kids don\u2019t cuz many find parents to be a nag around this age) but Sasuke can. As you grow up, you (hopefully) learn how to look from other perspectives that aren\u2019t your own with a more accurate scope of emotions, and so you learn to better SYMPATHIZE. It\u2019s much easier for kids to empathize than sympathize.",

Sakura was still ignorant and getting ahead of herself/getting a big head. Sasuke isn't as much ignorant but is moreso spiteful and sour. He simply doesn't care even if he understands the circumstance. It'd be interesting to see how he'd have been if the massacre didn't happen. He was a very happy and kind kid prior to the mess. I'd like to think he'd have stayed that way. Neji's situation is different but also similar to Sakura's. It's a circumstance of people needing to be humbled through something. Be it embarrassment, an asswhooping, understanding, or loss. Sure he had his backstory but that only dictated how far his attitude and snobbiness went.",

She was trying to release Naruto from his promise to her to bring Sasuke back Sai tells her right before that she is torturing Naruto with that promise. Naruto sees right through what's going on and calls her out. Is he pissed at her not really. She goes from kind of annoying and not super helpful in Naruto. To a medical genius capable of holding her own in a fight with akatsuki members, and run a triage unit during the pain fight. Then becomes a war hero capable of fighting alongside some of the strongest shinobi ever. She also keeps Naruto alive by reaching in his chest and manually pumping his fucking heart. Not to mention they don't beat kaguya without her or get back to this plane of existence without her helping obito. So yeah she grew you just choose to ignore it. I can find 2 examples of every single character doing or saying something dumb so give up this stupid hate on Sakura. It's wrong and it's been done before so now it's just annoying people making the same stupid arguments",

If your against physical violence probably shouldn't watch this show. Do you hate itachi for mentally abusing Sasuke or everyone in the leaf village for abandoning an orphan boy and treating him like shit. Or how about zabuza and his odd relationship with Haku if you look deep this whole ninja world is full of abuse so I mean  you really shouldn't watch this show at all if that's your reason for boy liking Sakura.",

He's not as anti-Sakura as most folks. \n\nThe main issue folks have with Sakura while similar rash or aggressive female characters like Temari or (the much better comparison) TEN-TEN are completely left alone and ignored is one glaring issue. Sakura is a main character who gets thrusted into the front and center proclaiming she walks along Naruto and Sasuke like she's been doing the same level of god-tier work while providing little to situations all the while treating others like crap. Ten Ten isn't a main character and she doesn't get much screen time either so she's able to freely move about acting like a little shit with little to no severe consequences from the fanbase. \n\n\nWatch the video, you'll get why people have serious issues with her, I will not pretend that the popularity of hating her doesn't exist. I will not ignore the fact there are plenty of folks who jump on the band wagon of love or hate trends. Those are Fairweather fans as my friend would put it, they're there when the getting is good but disappear when it no longer is popular.",

Sakura in shippuden is straight up the strongest kunoichi in the leaf. Also her superiority complex could come from the fact she is one of the smartest in her class (besides shikamaru). But tones that down with everybody but Ino in shippuden. Characters are allowed to have flaws. having them grow and become better and learn from those flaws is part of the story. Neji is a dick throughout most of regular Naruto but people don't hate on him like Sakura. Also the whole wanting to walk beside them is her character arc. She thinks she is when she is young realizes she is not at all works her ass off to become dope, proves she's dope both against the akatsuki realizes again she isn't at their level continues working and in the end they become a true team with her working alongside them. Is her power at their level? No. Is she stronger than damn near everybody at that point? Yes. Facts are they don't seal kaguya without her and she gets them back to this plane of existence with obito. I believe that counts as walking beside them",

She wasn't trying to help Naruto, she saw it as an opportunity to become the center of attention again. She didn't let her friends tell him what was going on with Sasuke. She didn't give consideration to how Naruto actually felt. She wanted to go off and play hero knowing she'd either lose or have to be rescued. I've never seen Sakura genuinely care about Naruto as much as she cares about herself, Sasuke, or Tsunade. \n\nSakura is horribly abusive. If a guy acted like that he'd have been arrested and charged. I can't stand her abuse of Naruto. Naruto has a big heart and is so loving. Her beating him up and treating him like crap at every turn is disgusting to me.",

She knocked out a whole group of her friends. While they were knocked out anything could've happened to them.  Danzo's group, the akatsuki, and etc were all running around. Other villages could've done anything to them while they were knocked out.\n\nSakura knew she was no match for Sasuke and yet she selfishly put herself in harm's way. She made Kakashi and Naruto have to risk themselves yet again! That girl is making me dislike her more and more every episode.\n\nAlso her inner monologue while she was traveling to see sasuke she was thinking about how she thought he was cool and that meant she loved him\n\nThey never even so much as went on a date. He was just a prize to her, that isn't love.",

You're even acting like her now, imagine that. Probably a compliment to you though lol\n\n>>Go cry elsewhere pal.\n\n1.

She wasnt really all that affected and didn't have to lose people she knew. \n\nShes also doubly removed from the workings of the uchiha massacre since shes civilian. So yeah, she did live in an ignorant, safe world until the tazuna mission. I think shes just a mean 13 year old girl who grows up to be better. 13 year olds can be the worst",

Not to mention how loud and brash he is. He talks about being Hokage without even passing the exams. *We* know he works hard, but its hard for thirteen year old sakura to not see him as a clown when hes paying zero attention in class and telling people he'll be president.\n\nnone of this is the trigger for what she says that then though even though these are factors. just two seconds ago \"sasuke\" (aka the henge) was trying to kiss her and now hes asking for *naruto*. naruto's sasuke's center of attention *again.*\n\nso she was puckering her lips earlier and now she has to deal with the sudden whiplash that is \"sasuke\"s mood so its obvious shes babbling. she even feels bad about it two seconds later.\n\nEDIT: also, idk much about tenten and she doesnt have much screentime as a kid, so we havent seen any childhood follies. but sasuke, neji and lee are people who are well aware of what kind of life shinobi deal with. sakura was naiive and didnt understand the dangers of being a shinobi at this point of time (this is like episode 2 or 3.. so. character development bro.)",

Which she clung to for the rest of her life. If the story was told from Sakura's perspective, we would all agree that's pretty fucked up. Because he never confessed that he is actually Naruto, and not Sasuke, Naruto manipulated Sakura into half a decade of chasing after a boy who wasn't ready for her. But the story is not told from Sakura's perspective. It's told from the perspective of a sad, lonely boy who wants attention. \n\nCan't really blame a child for listening to the words of the adults around her.",

Was it an appropriate comment? Not at all. But come on, she was a kid. They all were. She was a little girl having a crush on the handsome boy for whom she has to compete with just about every other girl. She didn't know better. It was her best judgement at the time for how she can get closer to her crush. Look at me in the eyes and tell me you didn't do stupid shit because of a crush. Oh, and did I mention she is just a kid? you know, just iterating this for those who impose their fully grown moral system on little Sakura. \n\nShe didn't know what Sasuke or Naruto have gone through at the time. As far as she's concerned, she was just simping. You really can't hold her to any higher moral standards people. That was a dumb thing to say, like most of what kids usually do",

The only reason why Sasuke reacted that way is because he related to Naruto, but if he didn\u2019t, he\u2019d have a similar snobby outlook to go w his superiority complex he\u2019d already had.\n\nAnd let\u2019s take a look at Neji, a notable asshole in part 1, yet y\u2019all don\u2019t give him shit just because how he was raised- yet how they were raised directly shaped how they treated others. Sakura being a normie and having a normie life and family shaped how she reacted to The correlation of Naruto\u2019s behavior and his absence of parents. She cannot relate to the pain of not having parents (as many kids don\u2019t cuz many find parents to be a nag around this age) but Sasuke can. As you grow up, you (hopefully) learn how to look from other perspectives that aren\u2019t your own with a more accurate scope of emotions, and so you learn to better SYMPATHIZE.

Sasuke isn't as much ignorant but is moreso spiteful and sour. He simply doesn't care even if he understands the circumstance. It'd be interesting to see how he'd have been if the massacre didn't happen. He was a very happy and kind kid prior to the mess. I'd like to think he'd have stayed that way. Neji's situation is different but also similar to Sakura's. It's a circumstance of people needing to be humbled through something. Be it embarrassment, an asswhooping, understanding, or loss.

Naruto sees right through what's going on and calls her out. Is he pissed at her not really. She goes from kind of annoying and not super helpful in Naruto. To a medical genius capable of holding her own in a fight with akatsuki members, and run a triage unit during the pain fight. Then becomes a war hero capable of fighting alongside some of the strongest shinobi ever. She also keeps Naruto alive by reaching in his chest and manually pumping his fucking heart. Not to mention they don't beat kaguya without her or get back to this plane of existence without her helping obito. So yeah she grew you just choose to ignore it. I can find 2 examples of every single character doing or saying something dumb so give up this stupid hate on Sakura. It's wrong and it's been done before so now it's just annoying people making the same stupid arguments",

He's not as anti-Sakura as most folks. \n\nThe main issue folks have with Sakura while similar rash or aggressive female characters like Temari or (the much better comparison) TEN-TEN are completely left alone and ignored is one glaring issue. Sakura is a main character who gets thrusted into the front and center proclaiming she walks along Naruto and Sasuke like she's been doing the same level of god-tier work while providing little to situations all the while treating others like crap. Ten Ten isn't a main character and she doesn't get much screen time either so she's able to freely move about acting like a little shit with little to no severe consequences from the fanbase. \n\n\nWatch the video, you'll get why people have serious issues with her, I will not pretend that the popularity of hating her doesn't exist. I will not ignore the fact there are plenty of folks who jump on the band wagon of love or hate trends. Those are Fairweather fans as my friend would put it, they're there when the getting is good but disappear when it no longer is popular.",

Neji is a dick throughout most of regular Naruto but people don't hate on him like Sakura. Also the whole wanting to walk beside them is her character arc. She thinks she is when she is young realizes she is not at all works her ass off to become dope, proves she's dope both against the akatsuki realizes again she isn't at their level continues working and in the end they become a true team with her working alongside them. Is her power at their level? No. Is she stronger than damn near everybody at that point? Yes.

She wasn't trying to help Naruto, she saw it as an opportunity to become the center of attention again. She didn't let her friends tell him what was going on with Sasuke. She didn't give consideration to how Naruto actually felt. She wanted to go off and play hero knowing she'd either lose or have to be rescued. I've never seen Sakura genuinely care about Naruto as much as she cares about herself, Sasuke, or Tsunade. \n\nSakura is horribly abusive. If a guy acted like that he'd have been arrested and charged. I can't stand her abuse of Naruto. Naruto has a big heart and is so loving. Her beating him up and treating him like crap at every turn is disgusting to me.",

She knocked out a whole group of her friends. While they were knocked out anything could've happened to them.  Danzo's group, the akatsuki, and etc were all running around. Other villages could've done anything to them while they were knocked out.\n\nSakura knew she was no match for Sasuke and yet she selfishly put herself in harm's way. She made Kakashi and Naruto have to risk themselves yet again! That girl is making me dislike her more and more every episode.\n\nAlso her inner monologue while she was traveling to see sasuke she was thinking about how she thought he was cool and that meant she loved him\n\nThey never even so much as went on a date.

You mean just watch the episodes themselves. You know, the literal best source. Also, provide your own \"research\" that you tout. I'm looking to have a laugh. Really.

You're even acting like her now, imagine that. Probably a compliment to you though lol\n\n>>Go cry elsewhere pal.\n\n1.

Not to mention how loud and brash he is. He talks about being Hokage without even passing the exams. *We* know he works hard, but its hard for thirteen year old sakura to not see him as a clown when hes paying zero attention in class and telling people he'll be president.\n\nnone of this is the trigger for what she says that then though even though these are factors. just two seconds ago \"sasuke\" (aka the henge) was trying to kiss her and now hes asking for *naruto*. naruto's sasuke's center of attention *again.*\n\nso she was puckering her lips earlier and now she has to deal with the sudden whiplash that is \"sasuke\"s mood so its obvious shes babbling. she even feels bad about it two seconds later.\n\nEDIT: also, idk much about tenten and she doesnt have much screentime as a kid, so we havent seen any childhood follies. but sasuke, neji and lee are people who are well aware of what kind of life shinobi deal with. sakura was naiive and didnt understand the dangers of being a shinobi at this point of time (this is like episode 2 or 3.. so. character development bro.)",

Which she clung to for the rest of her life. If the story was told from Sakura's perspective, we would all agree that's pretty fucked up. Because he never confessed that he is actually Naruto, and not Sasuke, Naruto manipulated Sakura into half a decade of chasing after a boy who wasn't ready for her. But the story is not told from Sakura's perspective. It's told from the perspective of a sad, lonely boy who wants attention. \n\nCan't really blame a child for listening to the words of the adults around her.",

I guarantee you, if Sasuke hadn\u2019t lost his family, he wouldve thought of Naruto the same way until he understood the pain of loneliness Naruto went through. The only reason why Sasuke reacted that way is because he related to Naruto, but if he didn\u2019t, he\u2019d have a similar snobby outlook to go w his superiority complex he\u2019d already had.\n\nAnd let\u2019s take a look at Neji, a notable asshole in part 1, yet y\u2019all don\u2019t give him shit just because how he was raised- yet how they were raised directly shaped how they treated others. Sakura being a normie and having a normie life and family shaped how she reacted to The correlation of Naruto\u2019s behavior and his absence of parents. She cannot relate to the pain of not having parents (as many kids don\u2019t cuz many find parents to be a nag around this age) but Sasuke can. As you grow up, you (hopefully) learn how to look from other perspectives that aren\u2019t your own with a more accurate scope of emotions, and so you learn to better SYMPATHIZE. It\u2019s much easier for kids to empathize than sympathize.",

Sasuke isn't as much ignorant but is moreso spiteful and sour. He simply doesn't care even if he understands the circumstance. It'd be interesting to see how he'd have been if the massacre didn't happen. He was a very happy and kind kid prior to the mess. I'd like to think he'd have stayed that way. Neji's situation is different but also similar to Sakura's. It's a circumstance of people needing to be humbled through something. Be it embarrassment, an asswhooping, understanding, or loss. Sure he had his backstory but that only dictated how far his attitude and snobbiness went.",

To a medical genius capable of holding her own in a fight with akatsuki members, and run a triage unit during the pain fight. Then becomes a war hero capable of fighting alongside some of the strongest shinobi ever. She also keeps Naruto alive by reaching in his chest and manually pumping his fucking heart. Not to mention they don't beat kaguya without her or get back to this plane of existence without her helping obito. So yeah she grew you just choose to ignore it. I can find 2 examples of every single character doing or saying something dumb so give up this stupid hate on Sakura.

He's not as anti-Sakura as most folks. \n\nThe main issue folks have with Sakura while similar rash or aggressive female characters like Temari or (the much better comparison) TEN-TEN are completely left alone and ignored is one glaring issue. Sakura is a main character who gets thrusted into the front and center proclaiming she walks along Naruto and Sasuke like she's been doing the same level of god-tier work while providing little to situations all the while treating others like crap. Ten Ten isn't a main character and she doesn't get much screen time either so she's able to freely move about acting like a little shit with little to no severe consequences from the fanbase. \n\n\nWatch the video, you'll get why people have serious issues with her, I will not pretend that the popularity of hating her doesn't exist. I will not ignore the fact there are plenty of folks who jump on the band wagon of love or hate trends. Those are Fairweather fans as my friend would put it, they're there when the getting is good but disappear when it no longer is popular.",

Characters are allowed to have flaws. having them grow and become better and learn from those flaws is part of the story. Neji is a dick throughout most of regular Naruto but people don't hate on him like Sakura. Also the whole wanting to walk beside them is her character arc. She thinks she is when she is young realizes she is not at all works her ass off to become dope, proves she's dope both against the akatsuki realizes again she isn't at their level continues working and in the end they become a true team with her working alongside them. Is her power at their level? No. Is she stronger than damn near everybody at that point? Yes. Facts are they don't seal kaguya without her and she gets them back to this plane of existence with obito. I believe that counts as walking beside them",

She wasn't trying to help Naruto, she saw it as an opportunity to become the center of attention again. She didn't let her friends tell him what was going on with Sasuke. She didn't give consideration to how Naruto actually felt. She wanted to go off and play hero knowing she'd either lose or have to be rescued. I've never seen Sakura genuinely care about Naruto as much as she cares about herself, Sasuke, or Tsunade. \n\nSakura is horribly abusive. If a guy acted like that he'd have been arrested and charged. I can't stand her abuse of Naruto. Naruto has a big heart and is so loving. Her beating him up and treating him like crap at every turn is disgusting to me.",

She knocked out a whole group of her friends. While they were knocked out anything could've happened to them.  Danzo's group, the akatsuki, and etc were all running around. Other villages could've done anything to them while they were knocked out.\n\nSakura knew she was no match for Sasuke and yet she selfishly put herself in harm's way. She made Kakashi and Naruto have to risk themselves yet again! That girl is making me dislike her more and more every episode.\n\nAlso her inner monologue while she was traveling to see sasuke she was thinking about how she thought he was cool and that meant she loved him\n\nThey never even so much as went on a date. He was just a prize to her, that isn't love.",

Not to mention how loud and brash he is. He talks about being Hokage without even passing the exams. *We* know he works hard, but its hard for thirteen year old sakura to not see him as a clown when hes paying zero attention in class and telling people he'll be president.\n\nnone of this is the trigger for what she says that then though even though these are factors. just two seconds ago \"sasuke\" (aka the henge) was trying to kiss her and now hes asking for *naruto*. naruto's sasuke's center of attention *again.*\n\nso she was puckering her lips earlier and now she has to deal with the sudden whiplash that is \"sasuke\"s mood so its obvious shes babbling. she even feels bad about it two seconds later.\n\nEDIT: also, idk much about tenten and she doesnt have much screentime as a kid, so we havent seen any childhood follies. but sasuke, neji and lee are people who are well aware of what kind of life shinobi deal with. sakura was naiive and didnt understand the dangers of being a shinobi at this point of time (this is like episode 2 or 3.. so. character development bro.)",

The only reason why Sasuke reacted that way is because he related to Naruto, but if he didn\u2019t, he\u2019d have a similar snobby outlook to go w his superiority complex he\u2019d already had.\n\nAnd let\u2019s take a look at Neji, a notable asshole in part 1, yet y\u2019all don\u2019t give him shit just because how he was raised- yet how they were raised directly shaped how they treated others. Sakura being a normie and having a normie life and family shaped how she reacted to The correlation of Naruto\u2019s behavior and his absence of parents. She cannot relate to the pain of not having parents (as many kids don\u2019t cuz many find parents to be a nag around this age) but Sasuke can. As you grow up, you (hopefully) learn how to look from other perspectives that aren\u2019t your own with a more accurate scope of emotions, and so you learn to better SYMPATHIZE. It\u2019s much easier for kids to empathize than sympathize.",

Sasuke isn't as much ignorant but is moreso spiteful and sour. He simply doesn't care even if he understands the circumstance. It'd be interesting to see how he'd have been if the massacre didn't happen. He was a very happy and kind kid prior to the mess. I'd like to think he'd have stayed that way. Neji's situation is different but also similar to Sakura's. It's a circumstance of people needing to be humbled through something. Be it embarrassment, an asswhooping, understanding, or loss. Sure he had his backstory but that only dictated how far his attitude and snobbiness went.",

Naruto sees right through what's going on and calls her out. Is he pissed at her not really. She goes from kind of annoying and not super helpful in Naruto. To a medical genius capable of holding her own in a fight with akatsuki members, and run a triage unit during the pain fight. Then becomes a war hero capable of fighting alongside some of the strongest shinobi ever. She also keeps Naruto alive by reaching in his chest and manually pumping his fucking heart. Not to mention they don't beat kaguya without her or get back to this plane of existence without her helping obito. So yeah she grew you just choose to ignore it. I can find 2 examples of every single character doing or saying something dumb so give up this stupid hate on Sakura. It's wrong and it's been done before so now it's just annoying people making the same stupid arguments",

He's not as anti-Sakura as most folks. \n\nThe main issue folks have with Sakura while similar rash or aggressive female characters like Temari or (the much better comparison) TEN-TEN are completely left alone and ignored is one glaring issue. Sakura is a main character who gets thrusted into the front and center proclaiming she walks along Naruto and Sasuke like she's been doing the same level of god-tier work while providing little to situations all the while treating others like crap. Ten Ten isn't a main character and she doesn't get much screen time either so she's able to freely move about acting like a little shit with little to no severe consequences from the fanbase. \n\n\nWatch the video, you'll get why people have serious issues with her, I will not pretend that the popularity of hating her doesn't exist. I will not ignore the fact there are plenty of folks who jump on the band wagon of love or hate trends.

Characters are allowed to have flaws. having them grow and become better and learn from those flaws is part of the story. Neji is a dick throughout most of regular Naruto but people don't hate on him like Sakura. Also the whole wanting to walk beside them is her character arc. She thinks she is when she is young realizes she is not at all works her ass off to become dope, proves she's dope both against the akatsuki realizes again she isn't at their level continues working and in the end they become a true team with her working alongside them. Is her power at their level? No. Is she stronger than damn near everybody at that point? Yes. Facts are they don't seal kaguya without her and she gets them back to this plane of existence with obito. I believe that counts as walking beside them",

I've never seen Sakura genuinely care about Naruto as much as she cares about herself, Sasuke, or Tsunade. \n\nSakura is horribly abusive. If a guy acted like that he'd have been arrested and charged. I can't stand her abuse of Naruto. Naruto has a big heart and is so loving.

Not to mention how loud and brash he is. He talks about being Hokage without even passing the exams. *We* know he works hard, but its hard for thirteen year old sakura to not see him as a clown when hes paying zero attention in class and telling people he'll be president.\n\nnone of this is the trigger for what she says that then though even though these are factors. just two seconds ago \"sasuke\" (aka the henge) was trying to kiss her and now hes asking for *naruto*. naruto's sasuke's center of attention *again.*\n\nso she was puckering her lips earlier and now she has to deal with the sudden whiplash that is \"sasuke\"s mood so its obvious shes babbling. she even feels bad about it two seconds later.\n\nEDIT: also, idk much about tenten and she doesnt have much screentime as a kid, so we havent seen any childhood follies. but sasuke, neji and lee are people who are well aware of what kind of life shinobi deal with. sakura was naiive and didnt understand the dangers of being a shinobi at this point of time (this is like episode 2 or 3.. so. character development bro.)",

You think *ew, thats creepy!*\n\nWhat do you have to say for the tons of other kids out there who are mean even when they have parents? Her having her parents is the thing. She doesnt see beyond it. Sakura too, its understandable *why* she said it, but its despicable and she literally grows past it in the next two seconds when she said, \"oh. this is how naruto must feel when i badmouth him. i'll have to try to be nicer.\"\n\nFalling for a guy and trying to kiss him is teen behavior.

Sasuke isn't as much ignorant but is moreso spiteful and sour. He simply doesn't care even if he understands the circumstance. It'd be interesting to see how he'd have been if the massacre didn't happen. He was a very happy and kind kid prior to the mess. I'd like to think he'd have stayed that way. Neji's situation is different but also similar to Sakura's. It's a circumstance of people needing to be humbled through something. Be it embarrassment, an asswhooping, understanding, or loss. Sure he had his backstory but that only dictated how far his attitude and snobbiness went.",

She was trying to release Naruto from his promise to her to bring Sasuke back Sai tells her right before that she is torturing Naruto with that promise. Naruto sees right through what's going on and calls her out. Is he pissed at her not really. She goes from kind of annoying and not super helpful in Naruto. To a medical genius capable of holding her own in a fight with akatsuki members, and run a triage unit during the pain fight. Then becomes a war hero capable of fighting alongside some of the strongest shinobi ever. She also keeps Naruto alive by reaching in his chest and manually pumping his fucking heart. Not to mention they don't beat kaguya without her or get back to this plane of existence without her helping obito. So yeah she grew you just choose to ignore it. I can find 2 examples of every single character doing or saying something dumb so give up this stupid hate on Sakura. It's wrong and it's been done before so now it's just annoying people making the same stupid arguments",

He's not as anti-Sakura as most folks. \n\nThe main issue folks have with Sakura while similar rash or aggressive female characters like Temari or (the much better comparison) TEN-TEN are completely left alone and ignored is one glaring issue. Sakura is a main character who gets thrusted into the front and center proclaiming she walks along Naruto and Sasuke like she's been doing the same level of god-tier work while providing little to situations all the while treating others like crap. Ten Ten isn't a main character and she doesn't get much screen time either so she's able to freely move about acting like a little shit with little to no severe consequences from the fanbase. \n\n\nWatch the video, you'll get why people have serious issues with her, I will not pretend that the popularity of hating her doesn't exist. I will not ignore the fact there are plenty of folks who jump on the band wagon of love or hate trends. Those are Fairweather fans as my friend would put it, they're there when the getting is good but disappear when it no longer is popular.",

Also her superiority complex could come from the fact she is one of the smartest in her class (besides shikamaru). But tones that down with everybody but Ino in shippuden. Characters are allowed to have flaws. having them grow and become better and learn from those flaws is part of the story. Neji is a dick throughout most of regular Naruto but people don't hate on him like Sakura. Also the whole wanting to walk beside them is her character arc. She thinks she is when she is young realizes she is not at all works her ass off to become dope, proves she's dope both against the akatsuki realizes again she isn't at their level continues working and in the end they become a true team with her working alongside them. Is her power at their level? No. Is she stronger than damn near everybody at that point? Yes. Facts are they don't seal kaguya without her and she gets them back to this plane of existence with obito. I believe that counts as walking beside them",

Put him down and made him make a promise she knew would be hard to fulfill. She's been selfish, bratty, rude, abusive and etc.\n\nALSO when Naruto heard horrible news about Jiraiya instead of her expressing something to Naruto she rudely tried to correct his mourning.\n\nThe 1st 7 seasons she was a hinderance to anything. She didn't even like Sasuke other than her best friend wanting him 1st. It was a competition to her and he was a prize. That isn't love...",

She wasn't trying to help Naruto, she saw it as an opportunity to become the center of attention again. She didn't let her friends tell him what was going on with Sasuke. She didn't give consideration to how Naruto actually felt. She wanted to go off and play hero knowing she'd either lose or have to be rescued. I've never seen Sakura genuinely care about Naruto as much as she cares about herself, Sasuke, or Tsunade. \n\nSakura is horribly abusive. If a guy acted like that he'd have been arrested and charged. I can't stand her abuse of Naruto. Naruto has a big heart and is so loving. Her beating him up and treating him like crap at every turn is disgusting to me.",

Other villages could've done anything to them while they were knocked out.\n\nSakura knew she was no match for Sasuke and yet she selfishly put herself in harm's way. She made Kakashi and Naruto have to risk themselves yet again! That girl is making me dislike her more and more every episode.\n\nAlso her inner monologue while she was traveling to see sasuke she was thinking about how she thought he was cool and that meant she loved him\n\nThey never even so much as went on a date.

Not to mention how loud and brash he is. He talks about being Hokage without even passing the exams. *We* know he works hard, but its hard for thirteen year old sakura to not see him as a clown when hes paying zero attention in class and telling people he'll be president.\n\nnone of this is the trigger for what she says that then though even though these are factors. just two seconds ago \"sasuke\" (aka the henge) was trying to kiss her and now hes asking for *naruto*. naruto's sasuke's center of attention *again.*\n\nso she was puckering her lips earlier and now she has to deal with the sudden whiplash that is \"sasuke\"s mood so its obvious shes babbling. she even feels bad about it two seconds later.\n\nEDIT: also, idk much about tenten and she doesnt have much screentime as a kid, so we havent seen any childhood follies. but sasuke, neji and lee are people who are well aware of what kind of life shinobi deal with. sakura was naiive and didnt understand the dangers of being a shinobi at this point of time (this is like episode 2 or 3.. so. character development bro.)",

To a medical genius capable of holding her own in a fight with akatsuki members, and run a triage unit during the pain fight. Then becomes a war hero capable of fighting alongside some of the strongest shinobi ever. She also keeps Naruto alive by reaching in his chest and manually pumping his fucking heart. Not to mention they don't beat kaguya without her or get back to this plane of existence without her helping obito. So yeah she grew you just choose to ignore it. I can find 2 examples of every single character doing or saying something dumb so give up this stupid hate on Sakura.

[Here's his pro-Sakura video ](https://youtu.be/4WwaCToiGpk) showing he's been reading Naruto and analyzing characters for a living for a long time. He's not as anti-Sakura as most folks. \n\nThe main issue folks have with Sakura while similar rash or aggressive female characters like Temari or (the much better comparison) TEN-TEN are completely left alone and ignored is one glaring issue. Sakura is a main character who gets thrusted into the front and center proclaiming she walks along Naruto and Sasuke like she's been doing the same level of god-tier work while providing little to situations all the while treating others like crap. Ten Ten isn't a main character and she doesn't get much screen time either so she's able to freely move about acting like a little shit with little to no severe consequences from the fanbase. \n\n\nWatch the video, you'll get why people have serious issues with her, I will not pretend that the popularity of hating her doesn't exist. I will not ignore the fact there are plenty of folks who jump on the band wagon of love or hate trends. Those are Fairweather fans as my friend would put it, they're there when the getting is good but disappear when it no longer is popular.",

Also her superiority complex could come from the fact she is one of the smartest in her class (besides shikamaru). But tones that down with everybody but Ino in shippuden. Characters are allowed to have flaws. having them grow and become better and learn from those flaws is part of the story. Neji is a dick throughout most of regular Naruto but people don't hate on him like Sakura. Also the whole wanting to walk beside them is her character arc. She thinks she is when she is young realizes she is not at all works her ass off to become dope, proves she's dope both against the akatsuki realizes again she isn't at their level continues working and in the end they become a true team with her working alongside them. Is her power at their level? No. Is she stronger than damn near everybody at that point? Yes. Facts are they don't seal kaguya without her and she gets them back to this plane of existence with obito. I believe that counts as walking beside them",

Not to mention how loud and brash he is. He talks about being Hokage without even passing the exams. *We* know he works hard, but its hard for thirteen year old sakura to not see him as a clown when hes paying zero attention in class and telling people he'll be president.\n\nnone of this is the trigger for what she says that then though even though these are factors. just two seconds ago \"sasuke\" (aka the henge) was trying to kiss her and now hes asking for *naruto*. naruto's sasuke's center of attention *again.*\n\nso she was puckering her lips earlier and now she has to deal with the sudden whiplash that is \"sasuke\"s mood so its obvious shes babbling. she even feels bad about it two seconds later.\n\nEDIT: also, idk much about tenten and she doesnt have much screentime as a kid, so we havent seen any childhood follies. but sasuke, neji and lee are people who are well aware of what kind of life shinobi deal with. sakura was naiive and didnt understand the dangers of being a shinobi at this point of time (this is like episode 2 or 3.. so. character development bro.)",

He's not as anti-Sakura as most folks. \n\nThe main issue folks have with Sakura while similar rash or aggressive female characters like Temari or (the much better comparison) TEN-TEN are completely left alone and ignored is one glaring issue. Sakura is a main character who gets thrusted into the front and center proclaiming she walks along Naruto and Sasuke like she's been doing the same level of god-tier work while providing little to situations all the while treating others like crap. Ten Ten isn't a main character and she doesn't get much screen time either so she's able to freely move about acting like a little shit with little to no severe consequences from the fanbase. \n\n\nWatch the video, you'll get why people have serious issues with her, I will not pretend that the popularity of hating her doesn't exist. I will not ignore the fact there are plenty of folks who jump on the band wagon of love or hate trends. Those are Fairweather fans as my friend would put it, they're there when the getting is good but disappear when it no longer is popular.",

Also her superiority complex could come from the fact she is one of the smartest in her class (besides shikamaru). But tones that down with everybody but Ino in shippuden. Characters are allowed to have flaws. having them grow and become better and learn from those flaws is part of the story. Neji is a dick throughout most of regular Naruto but people don't hate on him like Sakura. Also the whole wanting to walk beside them is her character arc. She thinks she is when she is young realizes she is not at all works her ass off to become dope, proves she's dope both against the akatsuki realizes again she isn't at their level continues working and in the end they become a true team with her working alongside them. Is her power at their level? No. Is she stronger than damn near everybody at that point? Yes. Facts are they don't seal kaguya without her and she gets them back to this plane of existence with obito. I believe that counts as walking beside them",

I've never seen Sakura genuinely care about Naruto as much as she cares about herself, Sasuke, or Tsunade. \n\nSakura is horribly abusive. If a guy acted like that he'd have been arrested and charged. I can't stand her abuse of Naruto. Naruto has a big heart and is so loving.

Not to mention how loud and brash he is. He talks about being Hokage without even passing the exams. *We* know he works hard, but its hard for thirteen year old sakura to not see him as a clown when hes paying zero attention in class and telling people he'll be president.\n\nnone of this is the trigger for what she says that then though even though these are factors. just two seconds ago \"sasuke\" (aka the henge) was trying to kiss her and now hes asking for *naruto*. naruto's sasuke's center of attention *again.*\n\nso she was puckering her lips earlier and now she has to deal with the sudden whiplash that is \"sasuke\"s mood so its obvious shes babbling. she even feels bad about it two seconds later.\n\nEDIT: also, idk much about tenten and she doesnt have much screentime as a kid, so we havent seen any childhood follies. but sasuke, neji and lee are people who are well aware of what kind of life shinobi deal with. sakura was naiive and didnt understand the dangers of being a shinobi at this point of time (this is like episode 2 or 3.. so. character development bro.)",

He's not as anti-Sakura as most folks. \n\nThe main issue folks have with Sakura while similar rash or aggressive female characters like Temari or (the much better comparison) TEN-TEN are completely left alone and ignored is one glaring issue. Sakura is a main character who gets thrusted into the front and center proclaiming she walks along Naruto and Sasuke like she's been doing the same level of god-tier work while providing little to situations all the while treating others like crap. Ten Ten isn't a main character and she doesn't get much screen time either so she's able to freely move about acting like a little shit with little to no severe consequences from the fanbase. \n\n\nWatch the video, you'll get why people have serious issues with her, I will not pretend that the popularity of hating her doesn't exist. I will not ignore the fact there are plenty of folks who jump on the band wagon of love or hate trends. Those are Fairweather fans as my friend would put it, they're there when the getting is good but disappear when it no longer is popular.",

Characters are allowed to have flaws. having them grow and become better and learn from those flaws is part of the story. Neji is a dick throughout most of regular Naruto but people don't hate on him like Sakura. Also the whole wanting to walk beside them is her character arc. She thinks she is when she is young realizes she is not at all works her ass off to become dope, proves she's dope both against the akatsuki realizes again she isn't at their level continues working and in the end they become a true team with her working alongside them. Is her power at their level? No. Is she stronger than damn near everybody at that point? Yes. Facts are they don't seal kaguya without her and she gets them back to this plane of existence with obito. I believe that counts as walking beside them",

Not to mention how loud and brash he is. He talks about being Hokage without even passing the exams. *We* know he works hard, but its hard for thirteen year old sakura to not see him as a clown when hes paying zero attention in class and telling people he'll be president.\n\nnone of this is the trigger for what she says that then though even though these are factors. just two seconds ago \"sasuke\" (aka the henge) was trying to kiss her and now hes asking for *naruto*. naruto's sasuke's center of attention *again.*\n\nso she was puckering her lips earlier and now she has to deal with the sudden whiplash that is \"sasuke\"s mood so its obvious shes babbling. she even feels bad about it two seconds later.\n\nEDIT: also, idk much about tenten and she doesnt have much screentime as a kid, so we havent seen any childhood follies. but sasuke, neji and lee are people who are well aware of what kind of life shinobi deal with. sakura was naiive and didnt understand the dangers of being a shinobi at this point of time (this is like episode 2 or 3.. so. character development bro.)",

[Here's his pro-Sakura video ](https://youtu.be/4WwaCToiGpk) showing he's been reading Naruto and analyzing characters for a living for a long time. He's not as anti-Sakura as most folks. \n\nThe main issue folks have with Sakura while similar rash or aggressive female characters like Temari or (the much better comparison) TEN-TEN are completely left alone and ignored is one glaring issue. Sakura is a main character who gets thrusted into the front and center proclaiming she walks along Naruto and Sasuke like she's been doing the same level of god-tier work while providing little to situations all the while treating others like crap. Ten Ten isn't a main character and she doesn't get much screen time either so she's able to freely move about acting like a little shit with little to no severe consequences from the fanbase. \n\n\nWatch the video, you'll get why people have serious issues with her, I will not pretend that the popularity of hating her doesn't exist. I will not ignore the fact there are plenty of folks who jump on the band wagon of love or hate trends. Those are Fairweather fans as my friend would put it, they're there when the getting is good but disappear when it no longer is popular.",

Also her superiority complex could come from the fact she is one of the smartest in her class (besides shikamaru). But tones that down with everybody but Ino in shippuden. Characters are allowed to have flaws. having them grow and become better and learn from those flaws is part of the story. Neji is a dick throughout most of regular Naruto but people don't hate on him like Sakura. Also the whole wanting to walk beside them is her character arc. She thinks she is when she is young realizes she is not at all works her ass off to become dope, proves she's dope both against the akatsuki realizes again she isn't at their level continues working and in the end they become a true team with her working alongside them. Is her power at their level? No. Is she stronger than damn near everybody at that point? Yes. Facts are they don't seal kaguya without her and she gets them back to this plane of existence with obito. I believe that counts as walking beside them",

Characters are allowed to have flaws. having them grow and become better and learn from those flaws is part of the story. Neji is a dick throughout most of regular Naruto but people don't hate on him like Sakura. Also the whole wanting to walk beside them is her character arc. She thinks she is when she is young realizes she is not at all works her ass off to become dope, proves she's dope both against the akatsuki realizes again she isn't at their level continues working and in the end they become a true team with her working alongside them. Is her power at their level? No. Is she stronger than damn near everybody at that point? Yes. Facts are they don't seal kaguya without her and she gets them back to this plane of existence with obito. I believe that counts as walking beside them",

Please.\n\n>>You see above.\n\nYeah, you've devolved into the mental state of your waifu lol\n\n>>Nah, you\u2019re mad because not everyone blindly hates a fictional character for no reason like you do.\n\nNah, you're just selectively blind to the massive hatred she justly draws to herself on multiple fronts and act in a way not dissimilar to putting your hands over your ears and screaming until people get tired of you. You're even acting like her now, imagine that. Probably a compliment to you though lol\n\n>>Go cry elsewhere pal.\n\n1. I'm not the one who came into the conversation running, desperately trying to defend his waifu.\n\n2. You're the upset one here though lol? It would have cost you 0 dollars to ignore my comment yet here you are, mr projection lmao",
