    "body": "28F from Australia here. I've sugared before a few years ago, and also have done various work that has helped me establish firm boundaries, safety precautions & opportunities to really trust my instincts when dealing with these sort of situations, whether that be sugaring, vanilla dating etc. \n\nI'm not sure if this is something that you do over in USA (I've noticed it seems to be different/sketchier), as I haven't really noticed anyone mention it before. But I wanted to share a little tip that has saved me so much time, energy and potentially dangerous situations that can happen at a M&G/meeting strangers.\n\nOnce I am feeling good about a POT and we are both happy to arrange a M&G, I ask to have a quick 5-10 min phone call with him to get a feel for his energy. You can gauge chemistry, conversation and a basic sense of who it is you're dealing within this phone call. I haven't had anyone decline this request, and I find it a really great way to get a feel for the person/what you're going into. Sometimes I've even had the POT ask about allowance expectations etc in this call, and we get to establish a rough idea before even going into a M&G - This has saved so much time and energy for me and hopefully it can help you too :)",

You will have no idea what I'm like or what our chemistry is if you cold call me, because I won't be totally me, if that makes sense, so any judgement you make on our chemistry will be badly flawed.   Luckily, it's rare anyone asks, and they always take \"no\" for an answer, so I can't remember turning anyone down in the past few years, although it might have happened.  \n\nWhich doesn't mean it isn't a great tip, just because my dumb ass can't deal.  Just keep in mind not everyone loves calls.  I skip profiles that have \"I require a phone call before meeting\" type message on the profile, but those seem to have completely disappeared\n\n\\*Since covid19 I've had to grudgingly adjust to the new way of doing things.

Now I have to figure out how to call into my fucking voicemail, just so I can erase your message without listening to it, to clear that notification?   My policy is, if someone leaves me even one non-urgent voicemail, I have an app that lets me cut them off from getting to my voicemail.  The phone still rings when they call, but if I don't answer some woman's voice comes on and tells them I'm not available.    Obviously, I don't tell my friends I have this policy -- which is why I still have friends. But they get voicemail banned if they do it even once.  But once in a while someone who is on the voicemail ban list will call, try to leave me a voicemail, and then next time he sees me:\n\nChad: Hey I called you the other day!  I tried to leave you a voicemail, but it must be full.\n\nMe: Oh, right, sorry.  But you can send me a text though, right?  Right?  You can send me a text?\n\nChad: Oh.  Uh sure.  I can send you a text.\n\nMe: *Backing away making finger guns*  Send me a text bro!",

I think you're reading my mind.  I am 100% with you.\n\nAs crazy as that all is, I bring the crazy to a whole new level when someone calls me and then **leaves me a voicemail**.  Like WTF bro?   Now I have to figure out how to call into my fucking voicemail, just so I can erase your message without listening to it, to clear that notification?   My policy is, if someone leaves me even one non-urgent voicemail, I have an app that lets me cut them off from getting to my voicemail.  The phone still rings when they call, but if I don't answer some woman's voice comes on and tells them I'm not available.    Obviously, I don't tell my friends I have this policy -- which is why I still have friends. But they get voicemail banned if they do it even once.  But once in a while someone who is on the voicemail ban list will call, try to leave me a voicemail, and then next time he sees me:\n\nChad: Hey I called you the other day!  I tried to leave you a voicemail, but it must be full.\n\nMe: Oh, right, sorry.  But you can send me a text though, right?  Right?  You can send me a text?\n\nChad: Oh.  Uh sure.  I can send you a text.\n\nMe: *Backing away making finger guns*  Send me a text bro!",

I've divided everything into: that would have been better as an email, that would have been better as online chat, that would have been better to hang out.\n\nAre you reading my mind right now?  I think you're reading my mind.  I am 100% with you.\n\nAs crazy as that all is, I bring the crazy to a whole new level when someone calls me and then **leaves me a voicemail**.  Like WTF bro?   Now I have to figure out how to call into my fucking voicemail, just so I can erase your message without listening to it, to clear that notification?   My policy is, if someone leaves me even one non-urgent voicemail, I have an app that lets me cut them off from getting to my voicemail.  The phone still rings when they call, but if I don't answer some woman's voice comes on and tells them I'm not available.    Obviously, I don't tell my friends I have this policy -- which is why I still have friends. But they get voicemail banned if they do it even once.  But once in a while someone who is on the voicemail ban list will call, try to leave me a voicemail, and then next time he sees me:\n\nChad: Hey I called you the other day!  I tried to leave you a voicemail, but it must be full.\n\nMe: Oh, right, sorry.  But you can send me a text though, right?  Right?  You can send me a text?\n\nChad: Oh.  Uh sure.  I can send you a text.\n\nMe: *Backing away making finger guns*  Send me a text bro!",
