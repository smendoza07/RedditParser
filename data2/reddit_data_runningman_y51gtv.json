There's people who sadly passed, groups who disbanded or lost a member, and all the old kpop meta jokes gone by. \n\nThere are so many episodes where I rewatch, and although I enjoy it, there's a little sting. I got into RM in the first place because of Big Bang's Princess Ji episode but watching some parts of that (and most BB episodes) make me go  \u0ca0\u2060\ufe4f\u2060\u0ca0. Especially in the case of Sulli and Hara, it's amazing how the saying \"hindsight is 20/20\" really shines a light on their actions and the way they act during RM episodes. \n\nI'm pretty sure a compilation like this exists, but someone complied all the episodes Hara appeared on RM and it showed how she started being more subdued as time went on. I wasn't a big KARA fan back in the day, but it's kinda crazy to see how the years and personal drama slowly took a toll on her.",
