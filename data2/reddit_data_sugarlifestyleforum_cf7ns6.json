    "body": "My (now ex) ex-SD and I were two of the most compatible people on this planet. We got along in all the right ways. He was the emotional yin to my sexual yang - and I loved that about him. Approximately 90 days ago he ended things with me due to family health reasons. He stated he was planning to take a step back from the business and work less to be at home. We\u2019d shared our lives with each other and with that many memorable moments. I was heart broken and yet thankful for the memories we had. \n\nI wrote about my feelings on our breakup [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/bh1j85/is_there_a_snarky_sugar_mentor_flair/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app).\n\nWhen he texted out of the blue a few weeks ago and mentioned he had a contract back in town I jumped at the chance to see him again. It never even crossed my mind to discuss restarting our arrangement (to be frank: I was horny as hell, too). We had a lovely dinner at one of my favorite restaurants and when we got back to his hotel room (for a nightcap, okay?!) I basically jumped him. Even then, things felt ... different. \n\nIt is hard to explain what has changed when you are standing in the middle of change itself. My heart was overjoyed that we were seeing each other again but my head was in a different place. I couldn\u2019t put my finger on what had shifted. Post-Coital we discussed his travel. He\u2019d be back for the next four months and would like to see me while he was in town. I agreed.\n\nOur next date was just as the first. Lovely dinner and drinks, a little shopping, and then back to the bedroom. Yet, our intimacy was short lived. Him and I had always been very exploratory in our sexual endeavors. We experimented with bondage, role play, positions, and even discussed a third. But, much like the first time, our second date was just sex. There was no erotic foreplay, no messy licking and touching. These are the things I live for. All the messy, wonderful, exploratory, make your heart race things. \n\nI\u2019d imagine if someone were to ask me where I draw the line on sex for money, it would be exactly where we stood. I was going through the motions of an intimate relationship with a man who had essentially become a friend. A good friend, yes, but our relationship no longer held the qualities that I look for in an SR. My passion and desire and .... breathlessness ... had died knowing that I was the girl this man had decided to pick up and put down on his own whims. It\u2019s funny how that works. Money buys a lot of things, but it doesn\u2019t buy feelings. \n\nHe\u2019s a good man, my ex. He didn\u2019t purposely do this to us. I think it is important to remember intent when we are looking at a potential wrong doing. He never intended for our relationship to turn this way. I think he cares deeply for me based on the fact that he reached out to me when he was back. But it doesn\u2019t change the fact that I am nothing more than expendable. Our relationship will not exist outside the four walls of our ticking alarm that is counting down the time to when he leaves again. The dream SR we had was shattered when we split and we tried building it again. But as the saying goes, once broken, it never fits together the same. \n\nI probably would have continued to exist in this relationship for the foreseeable future, losing little pieces of our glued together existence with each meeting. I\u2019d lost sight of what I originally joined SA for, and that is the feeling of excitement and passion and the unknown, while being cared for in ways my peers don\u2019t have access to.  I was grasping at a semblance of what *was* while not fully realizing it *was no more*. \n\nI probably would\u2019ve continued to see the man I\u2019ve always lovingly referred to as \u2018My Lover\u2019, until what we had became so tainted that I no longer looked back on the times with joy. Instead, a man I met recently looked me in the eye and told me I was the \u2018most undersold woman he\u2019d ever met\u2019 and then he backed me into an elevator and kissed me while tangling his fingers in my hair and touching me like I hadn\u2019t been touched in months. And it is in that moment, that I realized what I\u2019d been missing with my on again, off again relationship.\n\nPlacing an expiration date on a relationship is like giving someone a post-it when they want to paint a mural. Will I find that passion and spark and make it work like my ex and I did for so long? I don\u2019t know. But that\u2019s what\u2019s so exciting about life. The unknown. \n\nI will always carry the memories we had and view them fondly. My ex has built a foundation for future relationship standards moving forward. And for that I am grateful. But sometimes, to preserve integrity of good memories, it\u2019s best to know when to let go.",
