Looks a bit more \"manly\" I guess.\n\nMy advice is to let the beard grow and you'll be amazed at how well your cheeks will \"fill in\", and the more new hairs will grow!!! I thought my cheeks were too patchy to grow a full beard.... but the longer I've let it grow, the more it's all filled in. Some pics in my profile if you want some reference. Either way, you're a good looking dude, so clean shaven or beard both suit you well.",

Some guys benefit from a beard, some look worse but for many like you, it's neither here nor there. In such cases, I'd trust clean shaven more because beards can be terribly unhygienic if not properly and regularly cleaned. Worse than a toilet seat, in fact.\n\nYou don't have a baby face either, that's just an overused term and rather neanderthal-like. You're just a handsome, young guy who looks his age. That's the point really - are you really in such a rush to look older when you're not? When you're supposed to look older, you will.",

I thought my cheeks were too patchy to grow a full beard.... but the longer I've let it grow, the more it's all filled in. Some pics in my profile if you want some reference.
