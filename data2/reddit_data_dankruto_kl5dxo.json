So many characters should have just stayed dead.  The Sasuke Retrieval arc should have been the stepping stone from where Naruto went from a series about kids learning to become ninjas to kids actually *being* ninjas.  Death is a way to wrap up a character neatly when they serve no more purpose in the story.  Kakashi dying in his fight against Pain was really satisfying because it showed just how much Naruto grew.  He went from this little doofus who Kakashi could completely destroy without a second thought to utterly brutalizing 6 of the Pains at the same time when Kakashi was killed by just a single one of them, albeit a strong one.  Kakashi's bigger problem came in the War Arc when he essentially had unlimited Chakra and basically couldn't die.  The war arc was such a huge mistake and honestly the entire series should have been over after Pain's invasion.  Sasuke had defeated Itachi, Naruto defeated Pain and it was time to rebuild.  Why *not* make the hero of the Hidden Leaf the 6th Hokage since Tsunade was incapacitated?  It was already clear that he was strong enough to be the Hokage and all he needed was to be advised, which Shikamaru would be able to take the role.  \n\nYeah everything after Pain looked visually spectacular but making Naruto and Sasuke into untouchable gods wasn't really a good idea.",

Obito's death and Rin's death were the driving forces in Kakashi's character development.  Having Obito come back just kinda shits on that, especially considering that there was so much written about Kakashi's past where the fact that Obito was gone really drove Kakashi to change from who he was.  So many of Kakashi's traits like showing up late for everything all stemmed from how Obito was late doing random shit like helping the elderly get home.  Kakashi made those changes in his life BECAUSE Obito was gone.\n\nSix Paths was a pretty visually neat upgrade but man it bored the hell out of me.  It was basically unenterable plot armor.  Oh cool, Naruto can just come and save Gai from the effects of opening the 8th Gate making the emotion of that whole sequence gone and have it be just for the raw spectacle.  Cool, Naruto just healed Kakashi's eye and downgraded him to a hilariously weak level when they could have just recovered the Sharingan, or fuck, even just given him one of the 50,000,000 that Obito and Danzo had.",

So many characters should have just stayed dead.  The Sasuke Retrieval arc should have been the stepping stone from where Naruto went from a series about kids learning to become ninjas to kids actually *being* ninjas.  Death is a way to wrap up a character neatly when they serve no more purpose in the story.  Kakashi dying in his fight against Pain was really satisfying because it showed just how much Naruto grew.  He went from this little doofus who Kakashi could completely destroy without a second thought to utterly brutalizing 6 of the Pains at the same time when Kakashi was killed by just a single one of them, albeit a strong one.  Kakashi's bigger problem came in the War Arc when he essentially had unlimited Chakra and basically couldn't die.  The war arc was such a huge mistake and honestly the entire series should have been over after Pain's invasion.  Sasuke had defeated Itachi, Naruto defeated Pain and it was time to rebuild.  Why *not* make the hero of the Hidden Leaf the 6th Hokage since Tsunade was incapacitated?  It was already clear that he was strong enough to be the Hokage and all he needed was to be advised, which Shikamaru would be able to take the role.  \n\nYeah everything after Pain looked visually spectacular but making Naruto and Sasuke into untouchable gods wasn't really a good idea.",

Obito's death and Rin's death were the driving forces in Kakashi's character development.  Having Obito come back just kinda shits on that, especially considering that there was so much written about Kakashi's past where the fact that Obito was gone really drove Kakashi to change from who he was.  So many of Kakashi's traits like showing up late for everything all stemmed from how Obito was late doing random shit like helping the elderly get home.  Kakashi made those changes in his life BECAUSE Obito was gone.\n\nSix Paths was a pretty visually neat upgrade but man it bored the hell out of me.  It was basically unenterable plot armor.  Oh cool, Naruto can just come and save Gai from the effects of opening the 8th Gate making the emotion of that whole sequence gone and have it be just for the raw spectacle.  Cool, Naruto just healed Kakashi's eye and downgraded him to a hilariously weak level when they could have just recovered the Sharingan, or fuck, even just given him one of the 50,000,000 that Obito and Danzo had.",

Obito's death and Rin's death were the driving forces in Kakashi's character development.  Having Obito come back just kinda shits on that, especially considering that there was so much written about Kakashi's past where the fact that Obito was gone really drove Kakashi to change from who he was.  So many of Kakashi's traits like showing up late for everything all stemmed from how Obito was late doing random shit like helping the elderly get home.  Kakashi made those changes in his life BECAUSE Obito was gone.\n\nSix Paths was a pretty visually neat upgrade but man it bored the hell out of me.  It was basically unenterable plot armor.  Oh cool, Naruto can just come and save Gai from the effects of opening the 8th Gate making the emotion of that whole sequence gone and have it be just for the raw spectacle.  Cool, Naruto just healed Kakashi's eye and downgraded him to a hilariously weak level when they could have just recovered the Sharingan, or fuck, even just given him one of the 50,000,000 that Obito and Danzo had.",

Obito's death and Rin's death were the driving forces in Kakashi's character development.  Having Obito come back just kinda shits on that, especially considering that there was so much written about Kakashi's past where the fact that Obito was gone really drove Kakashi to change from who he was.  So many of Kakashi's traits like showing up late for everything all stemmed from how Obito was late doing random shit like helping the elderly get home.  Kakashi made those changes in his life BECAUSE Obito was gone.\n\nSix Paths was a pretty visually neat upgrade but man it bored the hell out of me.  It was basically unenterable plot armor.  Oh cool, Naruto can just come and save Gai from the effects of opening the 8th Gate making the emotion of that whole sequence gone and have it be just for the raw spectacle.  Cool, Naruto just healed Kakashi's eye and downgraded him to a hilariously weak level when they could have just recovered the Sharingan, or fuck, even just given him one of the 50,000,000 that Obito and Danzo had.",
