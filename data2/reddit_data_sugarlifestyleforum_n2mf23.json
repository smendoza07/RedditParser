    "body": "I worked for them and I feel like hardworking men should know the truth. \n\nThey make fake profiles they use a company like cloudworkers https://www.cloudworkers.company/en to make profiles and message men. These are run by multiple men/women who are all over the world.\n\nThey send out fake profile views, fake favorites and fake messages - if you ask the member about it or if the member tries to tell you the conversation is instantly blocked meaning you\u2019ve wasted credits. This happens about 80% of the time because the women try to be honest. \n\nThey can see EVERYTHING you send! They have a team of people who read every message sent they know someone is scamming you before you do they just don\u2019t care \n\nThe verifications are often fake and mean nothing a lot of the time it\u2019s not even the same person\n\nMany people who work for the site have online only or pic selling profiles this means the mostly African workers are scamming you both ways\n\nThe site is international to avoid regulations and rules such as age verification of minors. The site is flooded with underage girls who want to sell you feet pictures\n\nThe staff is 95% African, there are no background checks and they see and read all your info.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever bought credits on this site I highly suggest you get a refund. \n\nHerb and Stella are written by the same guy an unattractive married man who couldn\u2019t get laid if his life depended on it and he\u2019s definitely not a sugar daddy",

I had spent around $200 to message a few profiles, read some messages and look at a few uninspiring private pictures.  I got 2 responses but neither had any chance of going anywhere.  Service didn't reply, but 300 credits appeared on my account.  I assumed that was their way to get me to keep visiting the site.  A few days later, both my previous payments were refunded and my account was closed.  No communication.  I\"m afraid Ashley Madison proved there is a big market for charging men for what appears to be a chance to meet women.  You don't even need actual women to sell the \"chance\".  I believe that is SB's business model.  If a few actual women also create profiles, all the better.  It just contributes to the perception of legitimacy.",

It's possible the sugaring population just isn't big enough to attract a serious competitor.  No site I'm aware of, including SA, is focused on helping POT's meet each other or creating a robust community.  They are all focused on maximizing short-term revenue from people who are TRYING to meet.  That means fake profiles, scammers, online only, platonics (all things that damage the community and make it harder for POT's to find each other) are beneficial to their business model.",

Then it is to there benefit for you to run out of credits as soon as possible so you\u2019ll buy more.  This site is such a scam that they created an additional site called sugardaddy.com which is the exact same site with the same members.  So if you see a girl with two profiles that\u2019s why, but if you use credits to unlock a conversation with her off of one profile a lot of times you\u2019ll get no response and then a couple days later you\u2019ll get a message from her other profile and will have to spend more credits to read it.  I emailed them about it and got a 1000 credits when I called them out on it because the only purpose of the extra site is too make you burn more credits to talk to the same girls.  Then it also decreases your chances of actually meeting them so as long as you are only almost meeting girls and never finding a relationship you\u2019ll keep buying credits.  I will say that I have hooked up with maybe 25-30 girls off the site but that took a lot of credits and the skill of being able to pick out the few real girls in the ocean of fakes.",
