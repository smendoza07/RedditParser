    "body": "I took an Uber today across town for a business meeting. The Uber driver who picked me up was sooo cute. While she wore a mask, you could tell she had an amazing face. \n\nWe talked about why she was in town and what it was like to work for Uber. She mentioned she had boyfriend and was working a couple of jobs. I mentioned that is why she needs a sugar daddy. She laughed and agreed! I told her I\u2019d love to be that guy if she ever wanted to consider it.\n\nShe then asked me for my Instagram. I am chatting up her up now. I left her a big tip in the app. Not a sure thing but my gut says this is going to happen. What does the community think?\n\nFreestyling is kick ass! While I love SA, the thrill of overcoming rejection is a huge turn on.",

They can always feel free to say no without repercussion. \n\nJust my thoughts. I am not certain that there is a exactly a right and wrong here.

I declined in a first place, but accepted at the end as it's his way of showing appreciation and making sure I eat good quality food.\n\nMy rent or occasional sushi order makes absolutely no difference on his balances, but as said in other thread, I get into tears when having surprise flowers delivered home.

They can always feel free to say no without repercussion. \n\nJust my thoughts. I am not certain that there is a exactly a right and wrong here.

I do have a problem hitting on someone who either is relying on a tip for their income or has customer service as a large part of their compensation.  \n\nTo me you are forcing her hand on sugaring without possibly her knowledge of the lifestyle o and/or without her consent.  That crosses a line for me.\n\nSugaring in real life is meeting a patron of a bar, an attendee to a charity event or possibly a lady in a golf clubhouse. They can always feel free to say no without repercussion. \n\nJust my thoughts. I am not certain that there is a exactly a right and wrong here. It is just what I am willing to entertain.\n\nGood luck to all.",
