    "body": "It was February when I was diagnosed with Clinical Depression. I am living alone and just got off a six year relationship. I lost all my friends and most of the time never speak at work. The next thing I knew, the Pandemic hits and I'm worse than ever.\n\nI took another suicide attempt on May(first one was before I was diagnosed) which I thought would kill me since I could not ask anyone for help due to eh lockdown. Days of diarrhea and fever later I still managed to survive.\n\nIt was June when Twice held their comeback. I decided to binge watch all the shows they have been. Youtube algorithm led me to their third appearance at Knowing Bros. What a weird show I thought. But knowing that the characters have a dark past before and how they overcome it made me hopeful. Next thing I knew, I've watch around 30 eps. This is how I was introduced into variety shows.\n\nNetflix seems to knew as the next recommendation to me was Busted. Another weird show I guess. But hell do I enjoy it. Plot twists, humor, their characters and all. Took me three days to finish both seasons. And yes I craved for more.\n\nSo Google search suggested Running Man. I watched few clips on yt and I'm hooked. Did watch some eps. from Viu but I wanted  to watch from ep. 1 which is not available on the platform. Then I joined this community and was able to access the myrunningman.com. I have finished 100 eps and eps 500-current, which still is a long way to go.\n\nOn my last meeting with my therapist she seem to have seen some improvements in me. I now exercise daily, perform yoga and meditation and cook and eat healthier food. My workmates also seem to notice the change.\n\nLong story short, I would like to thank all mods here as well as the web admin, subbers and seeders of the myrunningman.com site to make the show accessible for international fans. This show and everyone who made it should know that you've helped at least a single soul get better from their depression.\n\nHopeful for their concert in the Philippines to be successful as well as I already reserved a VIP seat. :)\n\nTLDR; I've a depression, Running Man and other variety shows helped me get through it. My therapist is glad I'm no longer having dark thoughts.",

But i couldn't calm myself down so I watched the episode 473, the one with the they cant laugh challenge, which was by far the funniest thing I have ever seen. That moment of euphoria saved my life. Running Man saved my life at that moment, and I haven't looked back since. \n\nYour journey is an inspiration.",

Hyori's Bed and Breakfast and Youn's Kitchen.\n\nFor context, Hyori's B&B is about Hyori, a once-superstar (still are imo haha) running a B&B with her loving husband, Sangsoon (musician) along with the help of part-timer (IU in season 1 and Yoona & Park Bogum in season 2). It's available on Netflix.\n\nFor Youn's Kitchen, a group of actors and actresses run a restaurant abroad lead by Youn Yuh-jung. Season 1 was filmed in Indonesia with Shin Goo, Lee Seo Jin and Park Yu Mi. Season 2 was filmed in Spain with Lee Seo Jin, Park Yu Mi and Park Seo Joon. I personally like Season 2 :D",

Whether family or a friend, just talking about it helps. Doesn't even have to be face-to-face. Preferably a professional, but I know how it can be, so small steps, no?\n\nOn a similar note, please keep doing things that you enjoy whether that's watching the show, a hobby etc. Doing these things helps you stay afloat to hopefully find yourself in a time where you may find more strength to actively pursue a healthier mental state.",

I've watched RM since 2012. I wouldn't say that I have clinical depression because I haven't consulted with professional therapist, but this pandemic hits me quite hard. Since April I started to have the anxiety and constant worries. I think it hit the peak in June-mid July. I would suddenly cry, less and less appetite. But fortunately, I still have the interest to watch RM. Not a single day passed without me playing running man videos, whether I really watched it or just doing something while listening to the audio. Playing RM videos as the background of my every other activity really set the mood and atmosphere brighter. I believe I'm getting better and slowly but surely I will overcome the dark feeling that has been haunting me these couple months. I'm greatly thankful to everyone that made it possible for us to enjoy the show, and I wish the best for everyone.\n\noh, and If you like RM maybe you'll enjoy \"Family Outing\" (for me season 1 is preferable). It also has Yoo Jae Suk and Kim Jong Kook, and all other FO members have been guests in RM. It's older (2008-2010) but worth to watch, really.  I've recently rewatched some of the FO episodes.  Although it's supposed to be funny and superficial, I've unexpectedly found a lot of \"life lesson\" from there, like \"Timing is now\", and \"The Flavor of all soups can be enhanced\" (from episode 27 & 29).",

Every week, I would watch one episode of running man and it would make me forget about the stress and allow me to laugh out loud. Korean variety shows really have a magical touch that makes you laugh. I've heard others say that watching tv is a waste of time and that we are just escaping the reality. For me, Tv is my way to release stress, take a break and allow me to continue. I definitely thank all producers, actors, comedians, backstage crews for doing their best to give us a great show to watch every weekend.",

Although things still aren't great for me right now, I'm hopeful and thank god my parents, family and friends were there to help me out. Don't give up because it will definitely get better.",
