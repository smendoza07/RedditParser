Like Shippuden 177-178, where kid Naruto and Iruka bond (with bonus Kakashi, kid Shikamaru, and kid Choji!) (kinda breaks canon 'cause they don't really bond till later, but I just think it's cute/sweet, plus we get some killer Shikamaru-Naruto brOTP moments!), and also Shippuden 235, where Jiraiya and Naruto share the same views on their unrequited loves: they'll watch over them from afar, always wanting the best for them and wanting them to be happy, even if it's not with them. So cute!",

(kinda breaks canon 'cause they don't really bond till later, but I just think it's cute/sweet, plus we get some killer Shikamaru-Naruto brOTP moments!), and also Shippuden 235, where Jiraiya and Naruto share the same views on their unrequited loves: they'll watch over them from afar, always wanting the best for them and wanting them to be happy, even if it's not with them. So cute!",
