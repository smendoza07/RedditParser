I always say the same - I literally have told every woman I've been with that she's great. And it's not that they aren't, but it's rather meaningless and guys that say that come across as clueless IMO, but not sure how women think about that.",

It\u2019s just like anyone who calls themselves and \u201calpha\u201d is probably an insecure jackass. \n\nIn sugar it\u2019s even more laughable. The audience of women who is giving the feedback is far form unbiased. How better to keep a guy enthralled with you than to flatter him and tell him how his old ass rocked your world. \n\nFinally, it\u2019s sugar. Even if the guy is Casanova, I really don\u2019t care.

Just keep telling myself that karma is a bitch. The ones bragging about breaking down women's self confidence and making them feel cheap and like crap.. trying to deprogram our feminist sides?

The mental gymnastics are super entertaining over there. \n\nI also gave platinum to a guy for absolutely roasting the dude. He is probably not a good poster, but he said something like \"you brag about how much money you make but look for a discount when it comes to where you put your dick\" and I am honestly just going to copy and paste that whenever a Splenda low balls me because it's such a work of art.",

He is probably not a good poster, but he said something like \"you brag about how much money you make but look for a discount when it comes to where you put your dick\" and I am honestly just going to copy and paste that whenever a Splenda low balls me because it's such a work of art.",

My first SD use the mangum line - I never saw his dick to verify if it was accurate or not, but I doubted it based on the small tent he pitched.Mostly it's been vanilla guys though - always makes me roll my eyes.",

The mental gymnastics are super entertaining over there. \n\nI also gave platinum to a guy for absolutely roasting the dude. He is probably not a good poster, but he said something like \"you brag about how much money you make but look for a discount when it comes to where you put your dick\" and I am honestly just going to copy and paste that whenever a Splenda low balls me because it's such a work of art.",
