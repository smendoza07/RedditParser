I miss those days.\n\nThe new author (who I don't blame) tried best, but the world and the stakes just suck. We loved Naruto's world because it was a mix of old and new.\n\nIn Boruto, most of the things are just new, for the sake of showing modernization.\n\nBoruto could have been the story of Naruto and Sasugay building the connection between the villages.\n\nMaybe one of the villages revolt and break the peace. The hidden mist and the hidden rain seem to be one of those \"bad\" villages that could pose a threat.\n\nEdo tensei Madara had already made himself stabilized. Maybe one of the old kages would come back to pose a serious opposition.\n\nMan. I'm just sad. How amazing it could have been.",

I\u2019m still debating whether Naruto was sealed or killed, but either way that\u2019ll hit. If you remove Karma, Boruto is not interesting at all. I still prefer Mitsuki.",
