Memorize and use it.  Don't get scammed in 2019.\n\nEDIT:\nTo an SD's point,  you don't have to say the last part \"Nothing Personal. I've been lied to before\",  unless the SD asks why.   Good luck!",

First of all, calling me \"babe\" so early in the relationship (and if you're having to ask for the PPM up front, almost by definition this is the very first date) gets me on alert and is a turn-off, in many cases.  Second, although it makes sense, sometimes citing a negative reason (\"I've been cheated before\") can make it seem like you're implying that \"I think you might be a cheater\"... which of course you do, which is why you want your money up front, but it doesn't feel good to be told that.  \n\nI pay up front without being asked, when I remember, but this is a pretty heart-pounding moment for me, and I don't always remember.  What works like a charm on me is, when she gets this sort of sheepish flirty look on her face and says \"do you mind if we take care of the allowance now?\".  The facial expression says \"I'm almost embarrassed to ask this\", and I eat the whole thing up.  Maybe too passive for certain types of guys, but works great on me.",

I\u2019ve never had any SB request allowance before intimacy, and that\u2019s because I established trust through a pattern of treatment from meet and greet, to 1st platonic date, and then onto 1st intimate date. \n\nI would say a better way for a SB to avoid having to worry about this, is by only being intimate with SD that proves himself before the 1st intimate date. But this takes time. So if you\u2019re skipping steps and going from meet &  greet right to intimacy I can understand why you would want to get paid in advance.  \n\n\n",

But we dont share our concerns and fears with our POTS, because that would come off negative if we only talked above the bad stuff that happens or could happen. It was also come off insecure. You never show fear, or insecurity when dealing with anyone that you dont already have an established friendship or relationship with.\n\nSo telling a SD \"hey babe, can you pay me now, because I've been scammed\" Is really saying, \"Hey random guy I hooked up before establishing trust with you, I dont trust you yet, and you might do the same thing as the supposed last guy that scammed me.\" \n\nIts putting a negative vibe out there, casting doubt on the SD, and its going to kill the mood. In addition, if he has ever been burned before by a SB, he might also think she's a hustler, and might run off the with the money as soon as he gives it to her if she talked to him like this.",
