    "body": "Apologies for the length...\n\nAt the start of the holidays I had two SBs. SB1 is a student, barely in her 20\u2019s, and gorgeous. A solid 9 and she knows it. SB2 is a freelance writer in her mid 30\u2019s. She\u2019s a handsome woman but not classically beautiful. \n\nI\u2019d scheduled an intimate date with SB1 just before Christmas and I offered to cook her dinner at my home. Since she\u2019s a vegan I decided to make korma, basmati rice, and naan bread. (No small feat in my little town. When I asked for Garam Masala at the grocery store the clerk directed me to the pharmacy.) \n\nThe afternoon of our date SB1 texted to cancel. Family issues, sick relatives, yada, yada, yada... I\u2019d heard it before. I called SB2 and asked her to dinner. She accepted and told me that she\u2019d be happy to drink my champagne and eat my dinner but she made it plain that we would not have sex with me. She said she was not interested in being a backup booty call. I lied that was not my intent and that I\u2019d be pleased just to share a meal.\n\nDinner was great and after enduring a lot of mocking and teasing we did end up in bed and had a marvelous time together. The next morning SB2 is sitting naked in my bed eating fresh pineapple needling me. \u201cIf treating you like shit is the way to your heart I can do that!\u201d she said. I objected and said that SB1 probably had a perfectly good reason to cancel. SB2 wasn\u2019t buying it and made an intriguing offer, if I could suss out what SB1 was actually up to the previous night she, SB2, would offer up an unnatural act. I said fine and I grabbed the tablet next to the bed. \n\nIt didn\u2019t take long. Soon after we were viewing an IG post of one of SB1\u2019s friends showing a group of beautiful girls drinking margaritas and eating nachos. SB1 was front and center. She does enjoy having her picture taken. \n\nI put the tablet away, pulled down the sheets, and while  admiring her body I inquired about \u201cthe unnatural act.\u201d\n\nShe wiggled her ass, looked back at me over her shoulder and said, \u201cI want us to be monogamous.\u201d",
