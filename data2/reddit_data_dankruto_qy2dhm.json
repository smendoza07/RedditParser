Tsunade transformed her appearance by using her own healing to create a younger look. It's a healing jutsu, not a transformation jutsu where the victim sees something different. There is no \"underlying\" Tsunade. It's fully her, just a perpetual youthfulness. So when her passive healing is stopped due to lack of Chakra, her cells rapidly age, which, is not a transformation jutsu, it is a lack of healing.",

Tsunade transformed her appearance by using her own healing to create a younger look. It's a healing jutsu, not a transformation jutsu where the victim sees something different. There is no \"underlying\" Tsunade. It's fully her, just a perpetual youthfulness. So when her passive healing is stopped due to lack of Chakra, her cells rapidly age, which, is not a transformation jutsu, it is a lack of healing.",
