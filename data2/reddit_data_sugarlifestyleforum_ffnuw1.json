I eventually had enough money to move into my own place, get a vehicle as travel back to the state my son lives in. SD didn't know he helped a mom to her son again. So thankful",

Help with resume and spend a little $$$$ to help her beef up her LinkedIn with this new job info, networking and contacts as well. Having steady work, especially high performance or specialized work (I have made businesses for \\*SB's for \"Modeling Consulting\" even), will help out a TON with custody and stellar if your SD is a good referral! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSide Note:\n\nI haven't had an official SB before, because I always had natural relationships like this with younger women I spent time with... you guys call them vanilla :D Sometimes some people are in particular situations where some minor effort and support from someone else can be a literal **life-changer** and that is all I am in it for! I do not even need intimacy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe definitely get a positive happy feeling from watching you ladies progress... It is a gift that keeps on giving!",

Help with resume and spend a little $$$$ to help her beef up her LinkedIn with this new job info, networking and contacts as well. Having steady work, especially high performance or specialized work (I have made businesses for \\*SB's for \"Modeling Consulting\" even), will help out a TON with custody and stellar if your SD is a good referral! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSide Note:\n\nI haven't had an official SB before, because I always had natural relationships like this with younger women I spent time with... you guys call them vanilla :D Sometimes some people are in particular situations where some minor effort and support from someone else can be a literal **life-changer** and that is all I am in it for! I do not even need intimacy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe definitely get a positive happy feeling from watching you ladies progress... It is a gift that keeps on giving!",
