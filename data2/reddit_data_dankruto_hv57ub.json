We send them to a battleground where they have to be alert all the time for unseen threats like drones and IEDs. Then we send them home and expect them to check the emotional baggage at the airport and go back to \"normal\". \n\nBeing able to commiserate with people who've been through the same thing helps, which is why there are lower instances of PTSD among disaster survivors--because when an entire community is effected, they band together and are able to cope. After 9/11 there were actually (unexpectedly) much fewer suicides and reports of PTSD for the next *two years* than expected for this reason. \n\n[Source](https://youtu.be/-g7X1zn_0sM)",

When Itachi fought Naruto on an earlier occasion, he stuffed a crow into Naruto's stomach (it's weird how many animals live in his goddamn stomach. At least one toad hung out there too). The crow had an implanted sharingan that Itachi took from his childhood friend shisui (Danzo stole Shisui's other sharingan, so Itachi only had the one). Shisui's sharingan had the power to convince anyone of anything, and the target would not even realize they were being mind controlled. \n\nItachi programmed the crow/sharingan inside Naruto to (1) come out of Naruto once Naruto saw Itachi's mangekyou sharingan and (2) target the owner of that eye with the message to \"protect the leaf village.\" Itachi assumed that this program would only activate if Naruto saw Sasuke wearing Itachi's eyes. Itachi did not count on coming back as a zombie (Edo tensei). So the crow/sharingan was used on zombie Itachi instead of Sasuke, and the crow freed Itachi from the zombie control. Instead of being compelled to kill Naruto and fight for the enemy, zombie Itachi was compelled to save Naruto and defeat the enemy.",

All of a sudden the police get suspicious and the chief police say \" Your family acting a little suspicious, what's going on\" You say nothing. After a few days of debating whether you should tell him, you tell Loranzo (The chief of the FBI)  what's going on.  He gives you a sword and says \"Kill them all\". You say \" What the fuck am I going to do with a sword\" \"Fine\" and then he passes you an AK and you kill them. Now your family has regular hearts, but for whatever reason, if you add those hearts to yours, You never get tired,you can run a full marathon and never even sweat. So you kill everyone in the family, from adult to baby except your little brother and take their hearts. When he asks why their dead, you say \" Because you made me share the Xbox\" Then ride off on your bike and leave until you're in Mexico. Then you meet 2 guys nicknamed \"Rochy and Maru\" who wants to take your heart but wants to act like your friend. You two then join a group named the Mexicachi where they are tryna pull some hitler shit and control the world. All of a sudden Rochy and Maru try to jump you, so you beat their ass, and leave them. Few years go by and your little brother pull up with his crew, but your boy Kimande says only the brother can enter. All of a sudden you two are in this fight while Kimande is beating one of Rande's (the brother) crew's ass. Rande fights you  and he's a sore loser so he calls in a air strike and the whole place is gone. You survive, but your plot armor breaks and you die. Rande then takes your heart and hears your story from your enemy Tony, and decides to destroy the US. All of a sudden you're alive from some dark magic shit and you're fighting a yellow haired kid and use your heart to override the dark magic. You then stuff a whole fucking crow into his stomach with a fox and a talking frog. Next thing you know, your fighting a overgrown snake with your brother and defeat him. You die again because of your lack of plot armour. Then again you wake up to the yellow haired in fire and your brother with an op heart, fighting two people with horns, then LITERALLY FIGHTINTG A FUCKING GOD. You go back dead and that's the last time you are woken up, atleast until Boruto. And that's Itachi's life if he was real. I might start doing more of those, that was fun.",

They don\u2019t even have to talk back, just listening helps. Suppressing emotions is only \u201ccool\u201d in a fictional world like this, and even still look where it got them lmao they both are pretty obviously very messed up inside. Don\u2019t ever be afraid or think that it is \u201ccool\u201d to bottle things up. It all has to come out eventually.",

Let em use us as rags for tears then toss us aside when we need someone to talk to before we end up offing ourselves. \n\n\nSucks doesn't it? But its okay to suffer and teeter on the brink of suicide as long as we pay the bills, feed, cloth, pay insurance on, pay allimony towards the women we are responsible for, own a benz and $1M dollar estate in the burbs with a profitable job so we can bust our health and hands to boost the health and living conditions of someone else who doesn't give a flying noodle damn bout what we battle on the inside. \n\nI mean we're real men after all right?",

Obito did use izanagi to tank one blast after he put Itachi's eyes in Sasuke; but  if Itachi were alive he could have given him a second or third blast to compensate for izanagi. \n\nItachi could have also used izanami or his tsukoyomi to trap Obito. He actually killed his own girlfriend with tsukoyomi on a light novel. \n\nAnd then there's Itachi's susanoo with that soul-sealing blade. This would probably be the least effective option though. It takes time to summon, and Obito could likely use his powers to avoid being touched by the blade. Itachi's amaterasu is faster, and the genjutsu abilities are basically instant. \n\nI think Obito would almost definitely whoop Itachi in a brawl though.

We send them to a battleground where they have to be alert all the time for unseen threats like drones and IEDs. Then we send them home and expect them to check the emotional baggage at the airport and go back to \"normal\". \n\nBeing able to commiserate with people who've been through the same thing helps, which is why there are lower instances of PTSD among disaster survivors--because when an entire community is effected, they band together and are able to cope. After 9/11 there were actually (unexpectedly) much fewer suicides and reports of PTSD for the next *two years* than expected for this reason. \n\n[Source](https://youtu.be/-g7X1zn_0sM)",

When Itachi fought Naruto on an earlier occasion, he stuffed a crow into Naruto's stomach (it's weird how many animals live in his goddamn stomach. At least one toad hung out there too). The crow had an implanted sharingan that Itachi took from his childhood friend shisui (Danzo stole Shisui's other sharingan, so Itachi only had the one). Shisui's sharingan had the power to convince anyone of anything, and the target would not even realize they were being mind controlled. \n\nItachi programmed the crow/sharingan inside Naruto to (1) come out of Naruto once Naruto saw Itachi's mangekyou sharingan and (2) target the owner of that eye with the message to \"protect the leaf village.\" Itachi assumed that this program would only activate if Naruto saw Sasuke wearing Itachi's eyes. Itachi did not count on coming back as a zombie (Edo tensei). So the crow/sharingan was used on zombie Itachi instead of Sasuke, and the crow freed Itachi from the zombie control. Instead of being compelled to kill Naruto and fight for the enemy, zombie Itachi was compelled to save Naruto and defeat the enemy.",

            "body": "Imagine being a 13 year old named Terachi. All of a sudden your family wants to rebel against the government for doing them dirty, and your dad wants you to lead them. All of a sudden the police get suspicious and the chief police say \" Your family acting a little suspicious, what's going on\" You say nothing. After a few days of debating whether you should tell him, you tell Loranzo (The chief of the FBI)  what's going on.  He gives you a sword and says \"Kill them all\". You say \" What the fuck am I going to do with a sword\" \"Fine\" and then he passes you an AK and you kill them. Now your family has regular hearts, but for whatever reason, if you add those hearts to yours, You never get tired,you can run a full marathon and never even sweat. So you kill everyone in the family, from adult to baby except your little brother and take their hearts. When he asks why their dead, you say \" Because you made me share the Xbox\" Then ride off on your bike and leave until you're in Mexico. Then you meet 2 guys nicknamed \"Rochy and Maru\" who wants to take your heart but wants to act like your friend. You two then join a group named the Mexicachi where they are tryna pull some hitler shit and control the world. All of a sudden Rochy and Maru try to jump you, so you beat their ass, and leave them. Few years go by and your little brother pull up with his crew, but your boy Kimande says only the brother can enter. All of a sudden you two are in this fight while Kimande is beating one of Rande's (the brother) crew's ass. Rande fights you  and he's a sore loser so he calls in a air strike and the whole place is gone. You survive, but your plot armor breaks and you die. Rande then takes your heart and hears your story from your enemy Tony, and decides to destroy the US. All of a sudden you're alive from some dark magic shit and you're fighting a yellow haired kid and use your heart to override the dark magic. You then stuff a whole fucking crow into his stomach with a fox and a talking frog. Next thing you know, your fighting a overgrown snake with your brother and defeat him. You die again because of your lack of plot armour. Then again you wake up to the yellow haired in fire and your brother with an op heart, fighting two people with horns, then LITERALLY FIGHTINTG A FUCKING GOD. You go back dead and that's the last time you are woken up, atleast until Boruto. And that's Itachi's life if he was real. I might start doing more of those, that was fun.",

But Itachi had a lot of tools that could have killed Obito quickly if he struck first. \n\nItachi could have used Shisui's sharingan to convince Obito to abandon his plan, disband akatsuki, attack Kabuto, do something suicidal, or just about do anything that would prevent the war from happening. \n\nItachi could have lit Obito with amaterasu. Obito did use izanagi to tank one blast after he put Itachi's eyes in Sasuke; but  if Itachi were alive he could have given him a second or third blast to compensate for izanagi. \n\nItachi could have also used izanami or his tsukoyomi to trap Obito. He actually killed his own girlfriend with tsukoyomi on a light novel. \n\nAnd then there's Itachi's susanoo with that soul-sealing blade. This would probably be the least effective option though. It takes time to summon, and Obito could likely use his powers to avoid being touched by the blade. Itachi's amaterasu is faster, and the genjutsu abilities are basically instant. \n\nI think Obito would almost definitely whoop Itachi in a brawl though. Regeneration, better eyesight, seemingly stronger body, and wood powers on top of fire jutsu.",

We send them to a battleground where they have to be alert all the time for unseen threats like drones and IEDs. Then we send them home and expect them to check the emotional baggage at the airport and go back to \"normal\". \n\nBeing able to commiserate with people who've been through the same thing helps, which is why there are lower instances of PTSD among disaster survivors--because when an entire community is effected, they band together and are able to cope. After 9/11 there were actually (unexpectedly) much fewer suicides and reports of PTSD for the next *two years* than expected for this reason. \n\n[Source](https://youtu.be/-g7X1zn_0sM)",

When Itachi fought Naruto on an earlier occasion, he stuffed a crow into Naruto's stomach (it's weird how many animals live in his goddamn stomach. At least one toad hung out there too). The crow had an implanted sharingan that Itachi took from his childhood friend shisui (Danzo stole Shisui's other sharingan, so Itachi only had the one). Shisui's sharingan had the power to convince anyone of anything, and the target would not even realize they were being mind controlled. \n\nItachi programmed the crow/sharingan inside Naruto to (1) come out of Naruto once Naruto saw Itachi's mangekyou sharingan and (2) target the owner of that eye with the message to \"protect the leaf village.\" Itachi assumed that this program would only activate if Naruto saw Sasuke wearing Itachi's eyes. Itachi did not count on coming back as a zombie (Edo tensei). So the crow/sharingan was used on zombie Itachi instead of Sasuke, and the crow freed Itachi from the zombie control. Instead of being compelled to kill Naruto and fight for the enemy, zombie Itachi was compelled to save Naruto and defeat the enemy.",

Itachi wanted Sasuke to kill him because he believed dying to the last surviving Uchiha would serve as a good penance for his crimes.

But if Itachi never died, then he could have probably stopped Kabuto just the same. He could have also (possibly) killed Obito and prevented the whole war.",

But Itachi had a lot of tools that could have killed Obito quickly if he struck first. \n\nItachi could have used Shisui's sharingan to convince Obito to abandon his plan, disband akatsuki, attack Kabuto, do something suicidal, or just about do anything that would prevent the war from happening. \n\nItachi could have lit Obito with amaterasu. Obito did use izanagi to tank one blast after he put Itachi's eyes in Sasuke; but  if Itachi were alive he could have given him a second or third blast to compensate for izanagi. \n\nItachi could have also used izanami or his tsukoyomi to trap Obito. He actually killed his own girlfriend with tsukoyomi on a light novel. \n\nAnd then there's Itachi's susanoo with that soul-sealing blade. This would probably be the least effective option though. It takes time to summon, and Obito could likely use his powers to avoid being touched by the blade. Itachi's amaterasu is faster, and the genjutsu abilities are basically instant. \n\nI think Obito would almost definitely whoop Itachi in a brawl though.

When Itachi fought Naruto on an earlier occasion, he stuffed a crow into Naruto's stomach (it's weird how many animals live in his goddamn stomach. At least one toad hung out there too). The crow had an implanted sharingan that Itachi took from his childhood friend shisui (Danzo stole Shisui's other sharingan, so Itachi only had the one). Shisui's sharingan had the power to convince anyone of anything, and the target would not even realize they were being mind controlled. \n\nItachi programmed the crow/sharingan inside Naruto to (1) come out of Naruto once Naruto saw Itachi's mangekyou sharingan and (2) target the owner of that eye with the message to \"protect the leaf village.\" Itachi assumed that this program would only activate if Naruto saw Sasuke wearing Itachi's eyes. Itachi did not count on coming back as a zombie (Edo tensei). So the crow/sharingan was used on zombie Itachi instead of Sasuke, and the crow freed Itachi from the zombie control. Instead of being compelled to kill Naruto and fight for the enemy, zombie Itachi was compelled to save Naruto and defeat the enemy.",

Itachi wanted Sasuke to kill him because he believed dying to the last surviving Uchiha would serve as a good penance for his crimes. He also figured it would make Sasuke a hero to the Leaf Village, so they wouldn't carry their old mistrust of Uchihas against Sasuke. \n\nItachi dying meant Kabuto could resurrect him, and that (combined with Itachi's own plan to plant a crow inside Naruto that would be programmed to use genjutsu against anyone with Itachi's eyes [which should have meant Sasuke]) allowed Itachi to stop Kabuto's Edo tensei jutsu. But if Itachi never died, then he could have probably stopped Kabuto just the same. He could have also (possibly) killed Obito and prevented the whole war.",

But Itachi had a lot of tools that could have killed Obito quickly if he struck first. \n\nItachi could have used Shisui's sharingan to convince Obito to abandon his plan, disband akatsuki, attack Kabuto, do something suicidal, or just about do anything that would prevent the war from happening. \n\nItachi could have lit Obito with amaterasu. Obito did use izanagi to tank one blast after he put Itachi's eyes in Sasuke; but  if Itachi were alive he could have given him a second or third blast to compensate for izanagi. \n\nItachi could have also used izanami or his tsukoyomi to trap Obito. He actually killed his own girlfriend with tsukoyomi on a light novel. \n\nAnd then there's Itachi's susanoo with that soul-sealing blade. This would probably be the least effective option though. It takes time to summon, and Obito could likely use his powers to avoid being touched by the blade. Itachi's amaterasu is faster, and the genjutsu abilities are basically instant. \n\nI think Obito would almost definitely whoop Itachi in a brawl though. Regeneration, better eyesight, seemingly stronger body, and wood powers on top of fire jutsu.",

When Itachi fought Naruto on an earlier occasion, he stuffed a crow into Naruto's stomach (it's weird how many animals live in his goddamn stomach. At least one toad hung out there too). The crow had an implanted sharingan that Itachi took from his childhood friend shisui (Danzo stole Shisui's other sharingan, so Itachi only had the one). Shisui's sharingan had the power to convince anyone of anything, and the target would not even realize they were being mind controlled. \n\nItachi programmed the crow/sharingan inside Naruto to (1) come out of Naruto once Naruto saw Itachi's mangekyou sharingan and (2) target the owner of that eye with the message to \"protect the leaf village.\" Itachi assumed that this program would only activate if Naruto saw Sasuke wearing Itachi's eyes. Itachi did not count on coming back as a zombie (Edo tensei). So the crow/sharingan was used on zombie Itachi instead of Sasuke, and the crow freed Itachi from the zombie control. Instead of being compelled to kill Naruto and fight for the enemy, zombie Itachi was compelled to save Naruto and defeat the enemy.",

But Itachi had a lot of tools that could have killed Obito quickly if he struck first. \n\nItachi could have used Shisui's sharingan to convince Obito to abandon his plan, disband akatsuki, attack Kabuto, do something suicidal, or just about do anything that would prevent the war from happening. \n\nItachi could have lit Obito with amaterasu. Obito did use izanagi to tank one blast after he put Itachi's eyes in Sasuke; but  if Itachi were alive he could have given him a second or third blast to compensate for izanagi. \n\nItachi could have also used izanami or his tsukoyomi to trap Obito. He actually killed his own girlfriend with tsukoyomi on a light novel. \n\nAnd then there's Itachi's susanoo with that soul-sealing blade. This would probably be the least effective option though. It takes time to summon, and Obito could likely use his powers to avoid being touched by the blade. Itachi's amaterasu is faster, and the genjutsu abilities are basically instant. \n\nI think Obito would almost definitely whoop Itachi in a brawl though. Regeneration, better eyesight, seemingly stronger body, and wood powers on top of fire jutsu.",

But Itachi had a lot of tools that could have killed Obito quickly if he struck first. \n\nItachi could have used Shisui's sharingan to convince Obito to abandon his plan, disband akatsuki, attack Kabuto, do something suicidal, or just about do anything that would prevent the war from happening. \n\nItachi could have lit Obito with amaterasu. Obito did use izanagi to tank one blast after he put Itachi's eyes in Sasuke; but  if Itachi were alive he could have given him a second or third blast to compensate for izanagi. \n\nItachi could have also used izanami or his tsukoyomi to trap Obito. He actually killed his own girlfriend with tsukoyomi on a light novel. \n\nAnd then there's Itachi's susanoo with that soul-sealing blade. This would probably be the least effective option though. It takes time to summon, and Obito could likely use his powers to avoid being touched by the blade. Itachi's amaterasu is faster, and the genjutsu abilities are basically instant. \n\nI think Obito would almost definitely whoop Itachi in a brawl though.

Obito did use izanagi to tank one blast after he put Itachi's eyes in Sasuke; but  if Itachi were alive he could have given him a second or third blast to compensate for izanagi. \n\nItachi could have also used izanami or his tsukoyomi to trap Obito. He actually killed his own girlfriend with tsukoyomi on a light novel. \n\nAnd then there's Itachi's susanoo with that soul-sealing blade. This would probably be the least effective option though. It takes time to summon, and Obito could likely use his powers to avoid being touched by the blade. Itachi's amaterasu is faster, and the genjutsu abilities are basically instant. \n\nI think Obito would almost definitely whoop Itachi in a brawl though.
