He did when he fought Gaara and the 1 tails. He did in his last fight with Sasuke. He did fighting that bone dude that fought Lee. He literally did it *all the time.* He was always capable.

Gaara fight and Sasuke fight prime examples. There was no reason for Kakashi to hold out on him bro lmao.\n\nHe always could make hundreds. In Shippuden he just upgraded from hundreds to being able to make thousands.\n\n>before shippuden there\u2019s no way he could even come close to that, so training with clones wouldn\u2019t have been productive.\n\nSo are you saying the only way for the clone training to work is if he has thousands?

The one time he did subdue it, it was by using a one-time use seal somebody else made. So during clone training, either the third hokage, fourth hokage, orochimaru, jiraya, sasuke, or Yamato would have to be there. Those are the only people to be shown to have the ability to stop the 9-tails chakra. I guess the third is a bit of a stretch but he knew every jutsu in the leaf so I\u2019m putting him in there. \n\nRegardless, my point is kakashi can\u2019t just say \u201cgo train with your clones.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t save man-power or require less people there to help when things go wrong.",

It\u2019s also why they don\u2019t learn much ninjutsu in particular in the Academy - not all of them will pass. I don\u2019t see a point in getting mad at Iruka for that, especially because it\u2019s not like he\u2019s the one who wrote the curriculum in the first place. You\u2019re getting mad at the wrong person, there.\nKakashi _had_ to teach it, and that\u2019s why it wasn\u2019t impressive when he did.\n\n_Kakashi_ was the one who needed to put in more work. The Academy is supposed to teach the basics, it\u2019s the Jonin teachers who need to cultivate that into helping these kids master them to proficiency and figure out where their specialties may lie. The only reason Naruto and Sasuke knew other ninjutsu is because Sasuke learned it from his family, and Naruto learned it from the Forbidden scroll. Kakashi should have help made sure that they could use their basics in serious situations, and then gave them more tools to learn other techniques. Basic ninjutsu should be one of those things. He himself said Sakura could be skilled in genjutstu or something, right? So why didn\u2019t he teach her one? In my opinion, a good ninja has a technique of every element they could pull off, and a decent genjutsu, regardless of their specialties. \n\nKakashi didn\u2019t teach them much, even with the small amount of time he had with them. He taught Sasuke to be proficient in an advanced technique in a month - he could have taught all of them a lower-level one together in less than that. He just didn\u2019t. The only thing he helped Naruto with was to help him advance a technique he already had. And the advice may have been important, but chakra theory is something Naruto would have to learn from someone else, anyway. Kakashi also didn\u2019t go out of his way to teach him that, either - Naruto was asking, he answered. Kakashi\u2019s teaching wasn\u2019t really teaching at all.",

My problem with that interaction was more to do with the fact that Kakashi wasn\u2019t there for Naruto, period. Not only did Ebisu have to teach him water walking, but didn\u2019t Jiraiya pop up at around the same time and figure out something was wrong with Naruto\u2019s chakra with how he was struggling with the exercise? Not only did Naruto have to learn a control technique from someone who wasn\u2019t his teacher, there had been something seriously wrong with him and Jiraiya only figured it out by chance! Naruto didn\u2019t know what was wrong, and no one bothered to check if he had been okay to find out for themselves. Jiraiya, again, only taught Naruto by chance. In the anime, he had to beg, and I think in the manga, Jiraiya just stumbled across him and then made him his student (which is a different issue I won\u2019t get into right now). Ebisu made it clear that he didn\u2019t like Naruto, and he wasn\u2019t exactly helping him for Naruto\u2019s own sake, and Naruto appropriately ditched him for being a shit teacher. Naruto was left to flounder on his own because Kakashi didn\u2019t care enough to do his job. Sakura is a similar issue I won\u2019t get into right now.\n\nWater walking should have come after tree-walking. People headcanon that they\u2019re subsequent teachings for a reason. Why Kakashi didn\u2019t teach them more exercises after being rushed to do so in Wave is definitely ridiculous, and Ebisu shouldn\u2019t have had to pick up the slack after they were thrown in another dangerous situation like the Exam. Unlike Wave, however, Kakashi knew ahead of time that they\u2019d be at risk of dying - just not by outliers like Orochimaru. So why he didn\u2019t better prepare them is just nonsense.\n\nThey knew Sasuke was hurt, what, with the curse seal and all, but how is it that no one took the time to fucking interrogate the survivors of the test once they knew Orochimaru had infiltrated the damn thing? Did Kakashi not ask his team all the details of how Sasuke was cursed in the first place? If he did, he would have know that Naruto was attacked. And even if you didn\u2019t ask that, how did you not just wonder if anyone else on that team got hurt? Do a basic check out if only to make sure they didn\u2019t get sick from something in the forest? \n\nKakashi has 3 people he had to look after - checkups after an incident is the bare minimum. Naruto may not have understood what was wrong with him at the time, but someone would have. Sasuke needed an immediate stop gap, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can neglect to make sure everyone _else_ was okay.\n\nAnother thing was that Kakashi had no intention of teaching Naruto shit - didn\u2019t he pass him off on Ebisu on purpose without telling him? Ebisu doesn\u2019t even _like_ Naruto! He made it clear that Naruto\u2019s education isn\u2019t something he even wants to think about, so he made it someone else\u2019s problem, and I can\u2019t help but find that to be so cruel and cold. Maybe Kakashi didn\u2019t have much lined up for Naruto, but he could have sat down with Naruto and explained that to him, and help him find a teacher to who could better help him with what _he_ needs. _That\u2019s_ how it should have gone down! Treating Naruto like he isn\u2019t important or that his needs certainly aren\u2019t important to _him_ is why Kakashi bashers focus on that scene so much - it was needlessly cruel and negligent. Passing him off to someone else like an annoying dog he never wanted - and to someone who doesn\u2019t even like dogs to begin with is, again, cruel.",

I was more talking about that situation in general, not necessarily at all throughout the story, but it\u2019s not like Kakashi took the time to go out of his way to prove that wrong, either. Sasuke was the only student Kakashi went out of his way to teach something, too - Orochimaru or not, Kakashi should have put more effort into the education earlier and more consistently. And Sasuke only got that training because he had nothing in his arsenal to fight someone as brutal as Gaara. Yes, Sasuke needed the most attention _then,_ I\u2019m not arguing that - it\u2019s just that that\u2019s the only time he gave any of them attention as the teacher he was supposed to be.\n\nWhen he was training Naruto in Shippuden, he wasn\u2019t Naruto\u2019s sole source of guidance anymore, and he wasn\u2019t doing this in that capacity, anyway. In Shippuden, Kakashi was more their chaperone than a teacher by intention this time - his kids learned their primary education from someone else, and therefore didn\u2019t need to be as invested in their education because they learned enough from someone else and they thus didn\u2019t need him to anymore. He wasn\u2019t going out of his way to him anything new, but instead help him expand his knowledge on something he learned elsewhere.\n\nIs what I\u2019m saying making sense? In Shippuden, he wasn\u2019t their primary instructor anymore, and a more handsoff/lack of interest in cultivating their learning makes more sense, as he\u2019s chaperoning them as a superior officer, not as their primary source to cultivate their skills as a teacher as he should have been when they were first assigned to his team. They were novices, then, and now, they\u2019re becoming experts. It was more like a coworker helping them, or a professor helping a grad student, or a pro helping an intermediate player rather than a coach teaching a student - the lines of student-teacher were more blurred then, and more casual, as the student isn\u2019t in need of a traditional teacher where they are right now. I\u2019m glad he helped Naruto when he did, but he did so while Naruto wasn\u2019t really his student anymore, helping him hone a craft that Kakashi didn\u2019t help him learn. \n\nTLDR; I\u2019m not mad at all that Sakura and Naruto learned from the Sannin - it\u2019s just that Kakashi didn\u2019t really participate in the education as he should have before that, when he was, again, their only resource. Why is it that Kakashi only helped Naruto when he wasn\u2019t really his student anymore is what I\u2019m trying to get at, really. I\u2019m glad he helped, but it\u2019s soured by the fact that that\u2019s the _only_ time he helped He didn\u2019t help them master other basics when he had the chance to. Kishimoto wrote Kakashi as a bad and negligent teacher, really. Mostly because he forgot that they need to be taught things and kept making them learn from other people for interesting plot points that ends up making the universe less practical than it should have been.",

He did when he fought Gaara and the 1 tails. He did in his last fight with Sasuke. He did fighting that bone dude that fought Lee. He literally did it *all the time.* He was always capable.

The one time he did subdue it, it was by using a one-time use seal somebody else made. So during clone training, either the third hokage, fourth hokage, orochimaru, jiraya, sasuke, or Yamato would have to be there. Those are the only people to be shown to have the ability to stop the 9-tails chakra. I guess the third is a bit of a stretch but he knew every jutsu in the leaf so I\u2019m putting him in there. \n\nRegardless, my point is kakashi can\u2019t just say \u201cgo train with your clones.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t save man-power or require less people there to help when things go wrong.",

It\u2019s also why they don\u2019t learn much ninjutsu in particular in the Academy - not all of them will pass. I don\u2019t see a point in getting mad at Iruka for that, especially because it\u2019s not like he\u2019s the one who wrote the curriculum in the first place. You\u2019re getting mad at the wrong person, there.\nKakashi _had_ to teach it, and that\u2019s why it wasn\u2019t impressive when he did.\n\n_Kakashi_ was the one who needed to put in more work. The Academy is supposed to teach the basics, it\u2019s the Jonin teachers who need to cultivate that into helping these kids master them to proficiency and figure out where their specialties may lie. The only reason Naruto and Sasuke knew other ninjutsu is because Sasuke learned it from his family, and Naruto learned it from the Forbidden scroll. Kakashi should have help made sure that they could use their basics in serious situations, and then gave them more tools to learn other techniques. Basic ninjutsu should be one of those things. He himself said Sakura could be skilled in genjutstu or something, right? So why didn\u2019t he teach her one? In my opinion, a good ninja has a technique of every element they could pull off, and a decent genjutsu, regardless of their specialties. \n\nKakashi didn\u2019t teach them much, even with the small amount of time he had with them. He taught Sasuke to be proficient in an advanced technique in a month - he could have taught all of them a lower-level one together in less than that. He just didn\u2019t. The only thing he helped Naruto with was to help him advance a technique he already had. And the advice may have been important, but chakra theory is something Naruto would have to learn from someone else, anyway. Kakashi also didn\u2019t go out of his way to teach him that, either - Naruto was asking, he answered. Kakashi\u2019s teaching wasn\u2019t really teaching at all.",

My problem with that interaction was more to do with the fact that Kakashi wasn\u2019t there for Naruto, period. Not only did Ebisu have to teach him water walking, but didn\u2019t Jiraiya pop up at around the same time and figure out something was wrong with Naruto\u2019s chakra with how he was struggling with the exercise? Not only did Naruto have to learn a control technique from someone who wasn\u2019t his teacher, there had been something seriously wrong with him and Jiraiya only figured it out by chance! Naruto didn\u2019t know what was wrong, and no one bothered to check if he had been okay to find out for themselves. Jiraiya, again, only taught Naruto by chance. In the anime, he had to beg, and I think in the manga, Jiraiya just stumbled across him and then made him his student (which is a different issue I won\u2019t get into right now). Ebisu made it clear that he didn\u2019t like Naruto, and he wasn\u2019t exactly helping him for Naruto\u2019s own sake, and Naruto appropriately ditched him for being a shit teacher. Naruto was left to flounder on his own because Kakashi didn\u2019t care enough to do his job. Sakura is a similar issue I won\u2019t get into right now.\n\nWater walking should have come after tree-walking. People headcanon that they\u2019re subsequent teachings for a reason. Why Kakashi didn\u2019t teach them more exercises after being rushed to do so in Wave is definitely ridiculous, and Ebisu shouldn\u2019t have had to pick up the slack after they were thrown in another dangerous situation like the Exam. Unlike Wave, however, Kakashi knew ahead of time that they\u2019d be at risk of dying - just not by outliers like Orochimaru. So why he didn\u2019t better prepare them is just nonsense.\n\nThey knew Sasuke was hurt, what, with the curse seal and all, but how is it that no one took the time to fucking interrogate the survivors of the test once they knew Orochimaru had infiltrated the damn thing? Did Kakashi not ask his team all the details of how Sasuke was cursed in the first place? If he did, he would have know that Naruto was attacked. And even if you didn\u2019t ask that, how did you not just wonder if anyone else on that team got hurt? Do a basic check out if only to make sure they didn\u2019t get sick from something in the forest? \n\nKakashi has 3 people he had to look after - checkups after an incident is the bare minimum. Naruto may not have understood what was wrong with him at the time, but someone would have. Sasuke needed an immediate stop gap, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can neglect to make sure everyone _else_ was okay.\n\nAnother thing was that Kakashi had no intention of teaching Naruto shit - didn\u2019t he pass him off on Ebisu on purpose without telling him? Ebisu doesn\u2019t even _like_ Naruto! He made it clear that Naruto\u2019s education isn\u2019t something he even wants to think about, so he made it someone else\u2019s problem, and I can\u2019t help but find that to be so cruel and cold. Maybe Kakashi didn\u2019t have much lined up for Naruto, but he could have sat down with Naruto and explained that to him, and help him find a teacher to who could better help him with what _he_ needs. _That\u2019s_ how it should have gone down! Treating Naruto like he isn\u2019t important or that his needs certainly aren\u2019t important to _him_ is why Kakashi bashers focus on that scene so much - it was needlessly cruel and negligent. Passing him off to someone else like an annoying dog he never wanted - and to someone who doesn\u2019t even like dogs to begin with is, again, cruel.",

But I doubt he planned on just neglecting Naruto, he ended up training him again in Shippuden, definitely made up for what he didn't do back then. Naruto's training was coming eventually but it was just clear Kakashi wanted to whip Sasuke into shape first.",

I was more talking about that situation in general, not necessarily at all throughout the story, but it\u2019s not like Kakashi took the time to go out of his way to prove that wrong, either. Sasuke was the only student Kakashi went out of his way to teach something, too - Orochimaru or not, Kakashi should have put more effort into the education earlier and more consistently. And Sasuke only got that training because he had nothing in his arsenal to fight someone as brutal as Gaara. Yes, Sasuke needed the most attention _then,_ I\u2019m not arguing that - it\u2019s just that that\u2019s the only time he gave any of them attention as the teacher he was supposed to be.\n\nWhen he was training Naruto in Shippuden, he wasn\u2019t Naruto\u2019s sole source of guidance anymore, and he wasn\u2019t doing this in that capacity, anyway. In Shippuden, Kakashi was more their chaperone than a teacher by intention this time - his kids learned their primary education from someone else, and therefore didn\u2019t need to be as invested in their education because they learned enough from someone else and they thus didn\u2019t need him to anymore. He wasn\u2019t going out of his way to him anything new, but instead help him expand his knowledge on something he learned elsewhere.\n\nIs what I\u2019m saying making sense? In Shippuden, he wasn\u2019t their primary instructor anymore, and a more handsoff/lack of interest in cultivating their learning makes more sense, as he\u2019s chaperoning them as a superior officer, not as their primary source to cultivate their skills as a teacher as he should have been when they were first assigned to his team. They were novices, then, and now, they\u2019re becoming experts. It was more like a coworker helping them, or a professor helping a grad student, or a pro helping an intermediate player rather than a coach teaching a student - the lines of student-teacher were more blurred then, and more casual, as the student isn\u2019t in need of a traditional teacher where they are right now. I\u2019m glad he helped Naruto when he did, but he did so while Naruto wasn\u2019t really his student anymore, helping him hone a craft that Kakashi didn\u2019t help him learn. \n\nTLDR; I\u2019m not mad at all that Sakura and Naruto learned from the Sannin - it\u2019s just that Kakashi didn\u2019t really participate in the education as he should have before that, when he was, again, their only resource. Why is it that Kakashi only helped Naruto when he wasn\u2019t really his student anymore is what I\u2019m trying to get at, really. I\u2019m glad he helped, but it\u2019s soured by the fact that that\u2019s the _only_ time he helped He didn\u2019t help them master other basics when he had the chance to. Kishimoto wrote Kakashi as a bad and negligent teacher, really. Mostly because he forgot that they need to be taught things and kept making them learn from other people for interesting plot points that ends up making the universe less practical than it should have been.",

He did when he fought Gaara and the 1 tails. He did in his last fight with Sasuke. He did fighting that bone dude that fought Lee. He literally did it *all the time.* He was always capable. He just did it a lot more often in Shippuden because in shippuden he participates in a war and fought the Akatsuki. Just because he did it more often in Shippuden doesn't mean he *couldn't* do it when he was younger. Especially when he's done it literally time and time again all the time. Hundreds of clones never been an issue for him. Never.\n\n>Kakashi isn\u2019t great with them, and after the Zabuza fight when he had low chakra, he made more than naruto did the whole series except three times. \n\nKakashi never made more clones than Naruto.

It\u2019s also why they don\u2019t learn much ninjutsu in particular in the Academy - not all of them will pass. I don\u2019t see a point in getting mad at Iruka for that, especially because it\u2019s not like he\u2019s the one who wrote the curriculum in the first place. You\u2019re getting mad at the wrong person, there.\nKakashi _had_ to teach it, and that\u2019s why it wasn\u2019t impressive when he did.\n\n_Kakashi_ was the one who needed to put in more work. The Academy is supposed to teach the basics, it\u2019s the Jonin teachers who need to cultivate that into helping these kids master them to proficiency and figure out where their specialties may lie. The only reason Naruto and Sasuke knew other ninjutsu is because Sasuke learned it from his family, and Naruto learned it from the Forbidden scroll. Kakashi should have help made sure that they could use their basics in serious situations, and then gave them more tools to learn other techniques. Basic ninjutsu should be one of those things. He himself said Sakura could be skilled in genjutstu or something, right? So why didn\u2019t he teach her one? In my opinion, a good ninja has a technique of every element they could pull off, and a decent genjutsu, regardless of their specialties. \n\nKakashi didn\u2019t teach them much, even with the small amount of time he had with them. He taught Sasuke to be proficient in an advanced technique in a month - he could have taught all of them a lower-level one together in less than that. He just didn\u2019t. The only thing he helped Naruto with was to help him advance a technique he already had. And the advice may have been important, but chakra theory is something Naruto would have to learn from someone else, anyway. Kakashi also didn\u2019t go out of his way to teach him that, either - Naruto was asking, he answered. Kakashi\u2019s teaching wasn\u2019t really teaching at all.",

My problem with that interaction was more to do with the fact that Kakashi wasn\u2019t there for Naruto, period. Not only did Ebisu have to teach him water walking, but didn\u2019t Jiraiya pop up at around the same time and figure out something was wrong with Naruto\u2019s chakra with how he was struggling with the exercise? Not only did Naruto have to learn a control technique from someone who wasn\u2019t his teacher, there had been something seriously wrong with him and Jiraiya only figured it out by chance! Naruto didn\u2019t know what was wrong, and no one bothered to check if he had been okay to find out for themselves. Jiraiya, again, only taught Naruto by chance. In the anime, he had to beg, and I think in the manga, Jiraiya just stumbled across him and then made him his student (which is a different issue I won\u2019t get into right now). Ebisu made it clear that he didn\u2019t like Naruto, and he wasn\u2019t exactly helping him for Naruto\u2019s own sake, and Naruto appropriately ditched him for being a shit teacher. Naruto was left to flounder on his own because Kakashi didn\u2019t care enough to do his job. Sakura is a similar issue I won\u2019t get into right now.\n\nWater walking should have come after tree-walking. People headcanon that they\u2019re subsequent teachings for a reason. Why Kakashi didn\u2019t teach them more exercises after being rushed to do so in Wave is definitely ridiculous, and Ebisu shouldn\u2019t have had to pick up the slack after they were thrown in another dangerous situation like the Exam. Unlike Wave, however, Kakashi knew ahead of time that they\u2019d be at risk of dying - just not by outliers like Orochimaru. So why he didn\u2019t better prepare them is just nonsense.\n\nThey knew Sasuke was hurt, what, with the curse seal and all, but how is it that no one took the time to fucking interrogate the survivors of the test once they knew Orochimaru had infiltrated the damn thing? Did Kakashi not ask his team all the details of how Sasuke was cursed in the first place? If he did, he would have know that Naruto was attacked. And even if you didn\u2019t ask that, how did you not just wonder if anyone else on that team got hurt? Do a basic check out if only to make sure they didn\u2019t get sick from something in the forest? \n\nKakashi has 3 people he had to look after - checkups after an incident is the bare minimum. Naruto may not have understood what was wrong with him at the time, but someone would have. Sasuke needed an immediate stop gap, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can neglect to make sure everyone _else_ was okay.\n\nAnother thing was that Kakashi had no intention of teaching Naruto shit - didn\u2019t he pass him off on Ebisu on purpose without telling him? Ebisu doesn\u2019t even _like_ Naruto! He made it clear that Naruto\u2019s education isn\u2019t something he even wants to think about, so he made it someone else\u2019s problem, and I can\u2019t help but find that to be so cruel and cold. Maybe Kakashi didn\u2019t have much lined up for Naruto, but he could have sat down with Naruto and explained that to him, and help him find a teacher to who could better help him with what _he_ needs. _That\u2019s_ how it should have gone down! Treating Naruto like he isn\u2019t important or that his needs certainly aren\u2019t important to _him_ is why Kakashi bashers focus on that scene so much - it was needlessly cruel and negligent. Passing him off to someone else like an annoying dog he never wanted - and to someone who doesn\u2019t even like dogs to begin with is, again, cruel.",

I was more talking about that situation in general, not necessarily at all throughout the story, but it\u2019s not like Kakashi took the time to go out of his way to prove that wrong, either. Sasuke was the only student Kakashi went out of his way to teach something, too - Orochimaru or not, Kakashi should have put more effort into the education earlier and more consistently. And Sasuke only got that training because he had nothing in his arsenal to fight someone as brutal as Gaara. Yes, Sasuke needed the most attention _then,_ I\u2019m not arguing that - it\u2019s just that that\u2019s the only time he gave any of them attention as the teacher he was supposed to be.\n\nWhen he was training Naruto in Shippuden, he wasn\u2019t Naruto\u2019s sole source of guidance anymore, and he wasn\u2019t doing this in that capacity, anyway. In Shippuden, Kakashi was more their chaperone than a teacher by intention this time - his kids learned their primary education from someone else, and therefore didn\u2019t need to be as invested in their education because they learned enough from someone else and they thus didn\u2019t need him to anymore. He wasn\u2019t going out of his way to him anything new, but instead help him expand his knowledge on something he learned elsewhere.\n\nIs what I\u2019m saying making sense? In Shippuden, he wasn\u2019t their primary instructor anymore, and a more handsoff/lack of interest in cultivating their learning makes more sense, as he\u2019s chaperoning them as a superior officer, not as their primary source to cultivate their skills as a teacher as he should have been when they were first assigned to his team. They were novices, then, and now, they\u2019re becoming experts. It was more like a coworker helping them, or a professor helping a grad student, or a pro helping an intermediate player rather than a coach teaching a student - the lines of student-teacher were more blurred then, and more casual, as the student isn\u2019t in need of a traditional teacher where they are right now. I\u2019m glad he helped Naruto when he did, but he did so while Naruto wasn\u2019t really his student anymore, helping him hone a craft that Kakashi didn\u2019t help him learn. \n\nTLDR; I\u2019m not mad at all that Sakura and Naruto learned from the Sannin - it\u2019s just that Kakashi didn\u2019t really participate in the education as he should have before that, when he was, again, their only resource. Why is it that Kakashi only helped Naruto when he wasn\u2019t really his student anymore is what I\u2019m trying to get at, really. I\u2019m glad he helped, but it\u2019s soured by the fact that that\u2019s the _only_ time he helped He didn\u2019t help them master other basics when he had the chance to. Kishimoto wrote Kakashi as a bad and negligent teacher, really. Mostly because he forgot that they need to be taught things and kept making them learn from other people for interesting plot points that ends up making the universe less practical than it should have been.",

He did with Iruka. He did getting out the giant snake. He did when he fought Gaara and the 1 tails. He did in his last fight with Sasuke. He did fighting that bone dude that fought Lee. He literally did it *all the time.* He was always capable. He just did it a lot more often in Shippuden because in shippuden he participates in a war and fought the Akatsuki. Just because he did it more often in Shippuden doesn't mean he *couldn't* do it when he was younger. Especially when he's done it literally time and time again all the time. Hundreds of clones never been an issue for him. Never.\n\n>Kakashi isn\u2019t great with them, and after the Zabuza fight when he had low chakra, he made more than naruto did the whole series except three times. \n\nKakashi never made more clones than Naruto.

It\u2019s also why they don\u2019t learn much ninjutsu in particular in the Academy - not all of them will pass. I don\u2019t see a point in getting mad at Iruka for that, especially because it\u2019s not like he\u2019s the one who wrote the curriculum in the first place. You\u2019re getting mad at the wrong person, there.\nKakashi _had_ to teach it, and that\u2019s why it wasn\u2019t impressive when he did.\n\n_Kakashi_ was the one who needed to put in more work. The Academy is supposed to teach the basics, it\u2019s the Jonin teachers who need to cultivate that into helping these kids master them to proficiency and figure out where their specialties may lie. The only reason Naruto and Sasuke knew other ninjutsu is because Sasuke learned it from his family, and Naruto learned it from the Forbidden scroll. Kakashi should have help made sure that they could use their basics in serious situations, and then gave them more tools to learn other techniques. Basic ninjutsu should be one of those things. He himself said Sakura could be skilled in genjutstu or something, right? So why didn\u2019t he teach her one? In my opinion, a good ninja has a technique of every element they could pull off, and a decent genjutsu, regardless of their specialties. \n\nKakashi didn\u2019t teach them much, even with the small amount of time he had with them. He taught Sasuke to be proficient in an advanced technique in a month - he could have taught all of them a lower-level one together in less than that. He just didn\u2019t. The only thing he helped Naruto with was to help him advance a technique he already had. And the advice may have been important, but chakra theory is something Naruto would have to learn from someone else, anyway. Kakashi also didn\u2019t go out of his way to teach him that, either - Naruto was asking, he answered. Kakashi\u2019s teaching wasn\u2019t really teaching at all.",

Not only did Ebisu have to teach him water walking, but didn\u2019t Jiraiya pop up at around the same time and figure out something was wrong with Naruto\u2019s chakra with how he was struggling with the exercise? Not only did Naruto have to learn a control technique from someone who wasn\u2019t his teacher, there had been something seriously wrong with him and Jiraiya only figured it out by chance! Naruto didn\u2019t know what was wrong, and no one bothered to check if he had been okay to find out for themselves. Jiraiya, again, only taught Naruto by chance. In the anime, he had to beg, and I think in the manga, Jiraiya just stumbled across him and then made him his student (which is a different issue I won\u2019t get into right now). Ebisu made it clear that he didn\u2019t like Naruto, and he wasn\u2019t exactly helping him for Naruto\u2019s own sake, and Naruto appropriately ditched him for being a shit teacher. Naruto was left to flounder on his own because Kakashi didn\u2019t care enough to do his job. Sakura is a similar issue I won\u2019t get into right now.\n\nWater walking should have come after tree-walking. People headcanon that they\u2019re subsequent teachings for a reason. Why Kakashi didn\u2019t teach them more exercises after being rushed to do so in Wave is definitely ridiculous, and Ebisu shouldn\u2019t have had to pick up the slack after they were thrown in another dangerous situation like the Exam. Unlike Wave, however, Kakashi knew ahead of time that they\u2019d be at risk of dying - just not by outliers like Orochimaru. So why he didn\u2019t better prepare them is just nonsense.\n\nThey knew Sasuke was hurt, what, with the curse seal and all, but how is it that no one took the time to fucking interrogate the survivors of the test once they knew Orochimaru had infiltrated the damn thing? Did Kakashi not ask his team all the details of how Sasuke was cursed in the first place? If he did, he would have know that Naruto was attacked. And even if you didn\u2019t ask that, how did you not just wonder if anyone else on that team got hurt? Do a basic check out if only to make sure they didn\u2019t get sick from something in the forest? \n\nKakashi has 3 people he had to look after - checkups after an incident is the bare minimum. Naruto may not have understood what was wrong with him at the time, but someone would have. Sasuke needed an immediate stop gap, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can neglect to make sure everyone _else_ was okay.\n\nAnother thing was that Kakashi had no intention of teaching Naruto shit - didn\u2019t he pass him off on Ebisu on purpose without telling him? Ebisu doesn\u2019t even _like_ Naruto! He made it clear that Naruto\u2019s education isn\u2019t something he even wants to think about, so he made it someone else\u2019s problem, and I can\u2019t help but find that to be so cruel and cold. Maybe Kakashi didn\u2019t have much lined up for Naruto, but he could have sat down with Naruto and explained that to him, and help him find a teacher to who could better help him with what _he_ needs. _That\u2019s_ how it should have gone down! Treating Naruto like he isn\u2019t important or that his needs certainly aren\u2019t important to _him_ is why Kakashi bashers focus on that scene so much - it was needlessly cruel and negligent. Passing him off to someone else like an annoying dog he never wanted - and to someone who doesn\u2019t even like dogs to begin with is, again, cruel.",

Why the fuck water walking wasnt immediately followed after the tree walking is beyond me.

Ebisu doesn\u2019t even like Naruto!\n\nThat's a good point I never thought of that. But I doubt he planned on just neglecting Naruto, he ended up training him again in Shippuden, definitely made up for what he didn't do back then. Naruto's training was coming eventually but it was just clear Kakashi wanted to whip Sasuke into shape first.",

I was more talking about that situation in general, not necessarily at all throughout the story, but it\u2019s not like Kakashi took the time to go out of his way to prove that wrong, either. Sasuke was the only student Kakashi went out of his way to teach something, too - Orochimaru or not, Kakashi should have put more effort into the education earlier and more consistently. And Sasuke only got that training because he had nothing in his arsenal to fight someone as brutal as Gaara. Yes, Sasuke needed the most attention _then,_ I\u2019m not arguing that - it\u2019s just that that\u2019s the only time he gave any of them attention as the teacher he was supposed to be.\n\nWhen he was training Naruto in Shippuden, he wasn\u2019t Naruto\u2019s sole source of guidance anymore, and he wasn\u2019t doing this in that capacity, anyway. In Shippuden, Kakashi was more their chaperone than a teacher by intention this time - his kids learned their primary education from someone else, and therefore didn\u2019t need to be as invested in their education because they learned enough from someone else and they thus didn\u2019t need him to anymore. He wasn\u2019t going out of his way to him anything new, but instead help him expand his knowledge on something he learned elsewhere.\n\nIs what I\u2019m saying making sense? In Shippuden, he wasn\u2019t their primary instructor anymore, and a more handsoff/lack of interest in cultivating their learning makes more sense, as he\u2019s chaperoning them as a superior officer, not as their primary source to cultivate their skills as a teacher as he should have been when they were first assigned to his team. They were novices, then, and now, they\u2019re becoming experts. It was more like a coworker helping them, or a professor helping a grad student, or a pro helping an intermediate player rather than a coach teaching a student - the lines of student-teacher were more blurred then, and more casual, as the student isn\u2019t in need of a traditional teacher where they are right now. I\u2019m glad he helped Naruto when he did, but he did so while Naruto wasn\u2019t really his student anymore, helping him hone a craft that Kakashi didn\u2019t help him learn. \n\nTLDR; I\u2019m not mad at all that Sakura and Naruto learned from the Sannin - it\u2019s just that Kakashi didn\u2019t really participate in the education as he should have before that, when he was, again, their only resource. Why is it that Kakashi only helped Naruto when he wasn\u2019t really his student anymore is what I\u2019m trying to get at, really. I\u2019m glad he helped, but it\u2019s soured by the fact that that\u2019s the _only_ time he helped He didn\u2019t help them master other basics when he had the chance to. Kishimoto wrote Kakashi as a bad and negligent teacher, really. Mostly because he forgot that they need to be taught things and kept making them learn from other people for interesting plot points that ends up making the universe less practical than it should have been.",

He literally did it *all the time.* He was always capable. He just did it a lot more often in Shippuden because in shippuden he participates in a war and fought the Akatsuki.

It\u2019s also why they don\u2019t learn much ninjutsu in particular in the Academy - not all of them will pass. I don\u2019t see a point in getting mad at Iruka for that, especially because it\u2019s not like he\u2019s the one who wrote the curriculum in the first place. You\u2019re getting mad at the wrong person, there.\nKakashi _had_ to teach it, and that\u2019s why it wasn\u2019t impressive when he did.\n\n_Kakashi_ was the one who needed to put in more work. The Academy is supposed to teach the basics, it\u2019s the Jonin teachers who need to cultivate that into helping these kids master them to proficiency and figure out where their specialties may lie. The only reason Naruto and Sasuke knew other ninjutsu is because Sasuke learned it from his family, and Naruto learned it from the Forbidden scroll. Kakashi should have help made sure that they could use their basics in serious situations, and then gave them more tools to learn other techniques. Basic ninjutsu should be one of those things. He himself said Sakura could be skilled in genjutstu or something, right? So why didn\u2019t he teach her one? In my opinion, a good ninja has a technique of every element they could pull off, and a decent genjutsu, regardless of their specialties. \n\nKakashi didn\u2019t teach them much, even with the small amount of time he had with them. He taught Sasuke to be proficient in an advanced technique in a month - he could have taught all of them a lower-level one together in less than that. He just didn\u2019t. The only thing he helped Naruto with was to help him advance a technique he already had. And the advice may have been important, but chakra theory is something Naruto would have to learn from someone else, anyway. Kakashi also didn\u2019t go out of his way to teach him that, either - Naruto was asking, he answered. Kakashi\u2019s teaching wasn\u2019t really teaching at all.",

Not only did Ebisu have to teach him water walking, but didn\u2019t Jiraiya pop up at around the same time and figure out something was wrong with Naruto\u2019s chakra with how he was struggling with the exercise? Not only did Naruto have to learn a control technique from someone who wasn\u2019t his teacher, there had been something seriously wrong with him and Jiraiya only figured it out by chance! Naruto didn\u2019t know what was wrong, and no one bothered to check if he had been okay to find out for themselves. Jiraiya, again, only taught Naruto by chance. In the anime, he had to beg, and I think in the manga, Jiraiya just stumbled across him and then made him his student (which is a different issue I won\u2019t get into right now). Ebisu made it clear that he didn\u2019t like Naruto, and he wasn\u2019t exactly helping him for Naruto\u2019s own sake, and Naruto appropriately ditched him for being a shit teacher. Naruto was left to flounder on his own because Kakashi didn\u2019t care enough to do his job. Sakura is a similar issue I won\u2019t get into right now.\n\nWater walking should have come after tree-walking. People headcanon that they\u2019re subsequent teachings for a reason. Why Kakashi didn\u2019t teach them more exercises after being rushed to do so in Wave is definitely ridiculous, and Ebisu shouldn\u2019t have had to pick up the slack after they were thrown in another dangerous situation like the Exam. Unlike Wave, however, Kakashi knew ahead of time that they\u2019d be at risk of dying - just not by outliers like Orochimaru. So why he didn\u2019t better prepare them is just nonsense.\n\nThey knew Sasuke was hurt, what, with the curse seal and all, but how is it that no one took the time to fucking interrogate the survivors of the test once they knew Orochimaru had infiltrated the damn thing? Did Kakashi not ask his team all the details of how Sasuke was cursed in the first place? If he did, he would have know that Naruto was attacked. And even if you didn\u2019t ask that, how did you not just wonder if anyone else on that team got hurt? Do a basic check out if only to make sure they didn\u2019t get sick from something in the forest? \n\nKakashi has 3 people he had to look after - checkups after an incident is the bare minimum. Naruto may not have understood what was wrong with him at the time, but someone would have. Sasuke needed an immediate stop gap, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can neglect to make sure everyone _else_ was okay.\n\nAnother thing was that Kakashi had no intention of teaching Naruto shit - didn\u2019t he pass him off on Ebisu on purpose without telling him? Ebisu doesn\u2019t even _like_ Naruto! He made it clear that Naruto\u2019s education isn\u2019t something he even wants to think about, so he made it someone else\u2019s problem, and I can\u2019t help but find that to be so cruel and cold. Maybe Kakashi didn\u2019t have much lined up for Naruto, but he could have sat down with Naruto and explained that to him, and help him find a teacher to who could better help him with what _he_ needs. _That\u2019s_ how it should have gone down! Treating Naruto like he isn\u2019t important or that his needs certainly aren\u2019t important to _him_ is why Kakashi bashers focus on that scene so much - it was needlessly cruel and negligent. Passing him off to someone else like an annoying dog he never wanted - and to someone who doesn\u2019t even like dogs to begin with is, again, cruel.",

I was more talking about that situation in general, not necessarily at all throughout the story, but it\u2019s not like Kakashi took the time to go out of his way to prove that wrong, either. Sasuke was the only student Kakashi went out of his way to teach something, too - Orochimaru or not, Kakashi should have put more effort into the education earlier and more consistently. And Sasuke only got that training because he had nothing in his arsenal to fight someone as brutal as Gaara. Yes, Sasuke needed the most attention _then,_ I\u2019m not arguing that - it\u2019s just that that\u2019s the only time he gave any of them attention as the teacher he was supposed to be.\n\nWhen he was training Naruto in Shippuden, he wasn\u2019t Naruto\u2019s sole source of guidance anymore, and he wasn\u2019t doing this in that capacity, anyway. In Shippuden, Kakashi was more their chaperone than a teacher by intention this time - his kids learned their primary education from someone else, and therefore didn\u2019t need to be as invested in their education because they learned enough from someone else and they thus didn\u2019t need him to anymore. He wasn\u2019t going out of his way to him anything new, but instead help him expand his knowledge on something he learned elsewhere.\n\nIs what I\u2019m saying making sense? In Shippuden, he wasn\u2019t their primary instructor anymore, and a more handsoff/lack of interest in cultivating their learning makes more sense, as he\u2019s chaperoning them as a superior officer, not as their primary source to cultivate their skills as a teacher as he should have been when they were first assigned to his team. They were novices, then, and now, they\u2019re becoming experts. It was more like a coworker helping them, or a professor helping a grad student, or a pro helping an intermediate player rather than a coach teaching a student - the lines of student-teacher were more blurred then, and more casual, as the student isn\u2019t in need of a traditional teacher where they are right now. I\u2019m glad he helped Naruto when he did, but he did so while Naruto wasn\u2019t really his student anymore, helping him hone a craft that Kakashi didn\u2019t help him learn. \n\nTLDR; I\u2019m not mad at all that Sakura and Naruto learned from the Sannin - it\u2019s just that Kakashi didn\u2019t really participate in the education as he should have before that, when he was, again, their only resource. Why is it that Kakashi only helped Naruto when he wasn\u2019t really his student anymore is what I\u2019m trying to get at, really. I\u2019m glad he helped, but it\u2019s soured by the fact that that\u2019s the _only_ time he helped He didn\u2019t help them master other basics when he had the chance to. Kishimoto wrote Kakashi as a bad and negligent teacher, really. Mostly because he forgot that they need to be taught things and kept making them learn from other people for interesting plot points that ends up making the universe less practical than it should have been.",

He literally did it *all the time.* He was always capable. He just did it a lot more often in Shippuden because in shippuden he participates in a war and fought the Akatsuki. Just because he did it more often in Shippuden doesn't mean he *couldn't* do it when he was younger. Especially when he's done it literally time and time again all the time.

It\u2019s also why they don\u2019t learn much ninjutsu in particular in the Academy - not all of them will pass. I don\u2019t see a point in getting mad at Iruka for that, especially because it\u2019s not like he\u2019s the one who wrote the curriculum in the first place. You\u2019re getting mad at the wrong person, there.\nKakashi _had_ to teach it, and that\u2019s why it wasn\u2019t impressive when he did.\n\n_Kakashi_ was the one who needed to put in more work. The Academy is supposed to teach the basics, it\u2019s the Jonin teachers who need to cultivate that into helping these kids master them to proficiency and figure out where their specialties may lie. The only reason Naruto and Sasuke knew other ninjutsu is because Sasuke learned it from his family, and Naruto learned it from the Forbidden scroll. Kakashi should have help made sure that they could use their basics in serious situations, and then gave them more tools to learn other techniques. Basic ninjutsu should be one of those things. He himself said Sakura could be skilled in genjutstu or something, right? So why didn\u2019t he teach her one? In my opinion, a good ninja has a technique of every element they could pull off, and a decent genjutsu, regardless of their specialties. \n\nKakashi didn\u2019t teach them much, even with the small amount of time he had with them. He taught Sasuke to be proficient in an advanced technique in a month - he could have taught all of them a lower-level one together in less than that. He just didn\u2019t. The only thing he helped Naruto with was to help him advance a technique he already had. And the advice may have been important, but chakra theory is something Naruto would have to learn from someone else, anyway. Kakashi also didn\u2019t go out of his way to teach him that, either - Naruto was asking, he answered. Kakashi\u2019s teaching wasn\u2019t really teaching at all.",

                                            "body": "Oh, Ebisu! My problem with that interaction was more to do with the fact that Kakashi wasn\u2019t there for Naruto, period. Not only did Ebisu have to teach him water walking, but didn\u2019t Jiraiya pop up at around the same time and figure out something was wrong with Naruto\u2019s chakra with how he was struggling with the exercise? Not only did Naruto have to learn a control technique from someone who wasn\u2019t his teacher, there had been something seriously wrong with him and Jiraiya only figured it out by chance! Naruto didn\u2019t know what was wrong, and no one bothered to check if he had been okay to find out for themselves. Jiraiya, again, only taught Naruto by chance. In the anime, he had to beg, and I think in the manga, Jiraiya just stumbled across him and then made him his student (which is a different issue I won\u2019t get into right now). Ebisu made it clear that he didn\u2019t like Naruto, and he wasn\u2019t exactly helping him for Naruto\u2019s own sake, and Naruto appropriately ditched him for being a shit teacher. Naruto was left to flounder on his own because Kakashi didn\u2019t care enough to do his job. Sakura is a similar issue I won\u2019t get into right now.\n\nWater walking should have come after tree-walking. People headcanon that they\u2019re subsequent teachings for a reason. Why Kakashi didn\u2019t teach them more exercises after being rushed to do so in Wave is definitely ridiculous, and Ebisu shouldn\u2019t have had to pick up the slack after they were thrown in another dangerous situation like the Exam. Unlike Wave, however, Kakashi knew ahead of time that they\u2019d be at risk of dying - just not by outliers like Orochimaru. So why he didn\u2019t better prepare them is just nonsense.\n\nThey knew Sasuke was hurt, what, with the curse seal and all, but how is it that no one took the time to fucking interrogate the survivors of the test once they knew Orochimaru had infiltrated the damn thing? Did Kakashi not ask his team all the details of how Sasuke was cursed in the first place? If he did, he would have know that Naruto was attacked. And even if you didn\u2019t ask that, how did you not just wonder if anyone else on that team got hurt? Do a basic check out if only to make sure they didn\u2019t get sick from something in the forest? \n\nKakashi has 3 people he had to look after - checkups after an incident is the bare minimum. Naruto may not have understood what was wrong with him at the time, but someone would have. Sasuke needed an immediate stop gap, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can neglect to make sure everyone _else_ was okay.\n\nAnother thing was that Kakashi had no intention of teaching Naruto shit - didn\u2019t he pass him off on Ebisu on purpose without telling him? Ebisu doesn\u2019t even _like_ Naruto! He made it clear that Naruto\u2019s education isn\u2019t something he even wants to think about, so he made it someone else\u2019s problem, and I can\u2019t help but find that to be so cruel and cold. Maybe Kakashi didn\u2019t have much lined up for Naruto, but he could have sat down with Naruto and explained that to him, and help him find a teacher to who could better help him with what _he_ needs. _That\u2019s_ how it should have gone down! Treating Naruto like he isn\u2019t important or that his needs certainly aren\u2019t important to _him_ is why Kakashi bashers focus on that scene so much - it was needlessly cruel and negligent. Passing him off to someone else like an annoying dog he never wanted - and to someone who doesn\u2019t even like dogs to begin with is, again, cruel.",

I was more talking about that situation in general, not necessarily at all throughout the story, but it\u2019s not like Kakashi took the time to go out of his way to prove that wrong, either. Sasuke was the only student Kakashi went out of his way to teach something, too - Orochimaru or not, Kakashi should have put more effort into the education earlier and more consistently. And Sasuke only got that training because he had nothing in his arsenal to fight someone as brutal as Gaara. Yes, Sasuke needed the most attention _then,_ I\u2019m not arguing that - it\u2019s just that that\u2019s the only time he gave any of them attention as the teacher he was supposed to be.\n\nWhen he was training Naruto in Shippuden, he wasn\u2019t Naruto\u2019s sole source of guidance anymore, and he wasn\u2019t doing this in that capacity, anyway. In Shippuden, Kakashi was more their chaperone than a teacher by intention this time - his kids learned their primary education from someone else, and therefore didn\u2019t need to be as invested in their education because they learned enough from someone else and they thus didn\u2019t need him to anymore. He wasn\u2019t going out of his way to him anything new, but instead help him expand his knowledge on something he learned elsewhere.\n\nIs what I\u2019m saying making sense? In Shippuden, he wasn\u2019t their primary instructor anymore, and a more handsoff/lack of interest in cultivating their learning makes more sense, as he\u2019s chaperoning them as a superior officer, not as their primary source to cultivate their skills as a teacher as he should have been when they were first assigned to his team. They were novices, then, and now, they\u2019re becoming experts. It was more like a coworker helping them, or a professor helping a grad student, or a pro helping an intermediate player rather than a coach teaching a student - the lines of student-teacher were more blurred then, and more casual, as the student isn\u2019t in need of a traditional teacher where they are right now. I\u2019m glad he helped Naruto when he did, but he did so while Naruto wasn\u2019t really his student anymore, helping him hone a craft that Kakashi didn\u2019t help him learn. \n\nTLDR; I\u2019m not mad at all that Sakura and Naruto learned from the Sannin - it\u2019s just that Kakashi didn\u2019t really participate in the education as he should have before that, when he was, again, their only resource. Why is it that Kakashi only helped Naruto when he wasn\u2019t really his student anymore is what I\u2019m trying to get at, really. I\u2019m glad he helped, but it\u2019s soured by the fact that that\u2019s the _only_ time he helped He didn\u2019t help them master other basics when he had the chance to. Kishimoto wrote Kakashi as a bad and negligent teacher, really. Mostly because he forgot that they need to be taught things and kept making them learn from other people for interesting plot points that ends up making the universe less practical than it should have been.",

He literally did it *all the time.* He was always capable. He just did it a lot more often in Shippuden because in shippuden he participates in a war and fought the Akatsuki.

                                    "body": "Oh, Ebisu! My problem with that interaction was more to do with the fact that Kakashi wasn\u2019t there for Naruto, period. Not only did Ebisu have to teach him water walking, but didn\u2019t Jiraiya pop up at around the same time and figure out something was wrong with Naruto\u2019s chakra with how he was struggling with the exercise? Not only did Naruto have to learn a control technique from someone who wasn\u2019t his teacher, there had been something seriously wrong with him and Jiraiya only figured it out by chance! Naruto didn\u2019t know what was wrong, and no one bothered to check if he had been okay to find out for themselves. Jiraiya, again, only taught Naruto by chance. In the anime, he had to beg, and I think in the manga, Jiraiya just stumbled across him and then made him his student (which is a different issue I won\u2019t get into right now). Ebisu made it clear that he didn\u2019t like Naruto, and he wasn\u2019t exactly helping him for Naruto\u2019s own sake, and Naruto appropriately ditched him for being a shit teacher. Naruto was left to flounder on his own because Kakashi didn\u2019t care enough to do his job. Sakura is a similar issue I won\u2019t get into right now.\n\nWater walking should have come after tree-walking. People headcanon that they\u2019re subsequent teachings for a reason. Why Kakashi didn\u2019t teach them more exercises after being rushed to do so in Wave is definitely ridiculous, and Ebisu shouldn\u2019t have had to pick up the slack after they were thrown in another dangerous situation like the Exam. Unlike Wave, however, Kakashi knew ahead of time that they\u2019d be at risk of dying - just not by outliers like Orochimaru. So why he didn\u2019t better prepare them is just nonsense.\n\nThey knew Sasuke was hurt, what, with the curse seal and all, but how is it that no one took the time to fucking interrogate the survivors of the test once they knew Orochimaru had infiltrated the damn thing? Did Kakashi not ask his team all the details of how Sasuke was cursed in the first place? If he did, he would have know that Naruto was attacked. And even if you didn\u2019t ask that, how did you not just wonder if anyone else on that team got hurt? Do a basic check out if only to make sure they didn\u2019t get sick from something in the forest? \n\nKakashi has 3 people he had to look after - checkups after an incident is the bare minimum. Naruto may not have understood what was wrong with him at the time, but someone would have. Sasuke needed an immediate stop gap, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can neglect to make sure everyone _else_ was okay.\n\nAnother thing was that Kakashi had no intention of teaching Naruto shit - didn\u2019t he pass him off on Ebisu on purpose without telling him? Ebisu doesn\u2019t even _like_ Naruto! He made it clear that Naruto\u2019s education isn\u2019t something he even wants to think about, so he made it someone else\u2019s problem, and I can\u2019t help but find that to be so cruel and cold. Maybe Kakashi didn\u2019t have much lined up for Naruto, but he could have sat down with Naruto and explained that to him, and help him find a teacher to who could better help him with what _he_ needs. _That\u2019s_ how it should have gone down! Treating Naruto like he isn\u2019t important or that his needs certainly aren\u2019t important to _him_ is why Kakashi bashers focus on that scene so much - it was needlessly cruel and negligent. Passing him off to someone else like an annoying dog he never wanted - and to someone who doesn\u2019t even like dogs to begin with is, again, cruel.",

But I doubt he planned on just neglecting Naruto, he ended up training him again in Shippuden, definitely made up for what he didn't do back then. Naruto's training was coming eventually but it was just clear Kakashi wanted to whip Sasuke into shape first.",

I was more talking about that situation in general, not necessarily at all throughout the story, but it\u2019s not like Kakashi took the time to go out of his way to prove that wrong, either. Sasuke was the only student Kakashi went out of his way to teach something, too - Orochimaru or not, Kakashi should have put more effort into the education earlier and more consistently. And Sasuke only got that training because he had nothing in his arsenal to fight someone as brutal as Gaara. Yes, Sasuke needed the most attention _then,_ I\u2019m not arguing that - it\u2019s just that that\u2019s the only time he gave any of them attention as the teacher he was supposed to be.\n\nWhen he was training Naruto in Shippuden, he wasn\u2019t Naruto\u2019s sole source of guidance anymore, and he wasn\u2019t doing this in that capacity, anyway. In Shippuden, Kakashi was more their chaperone than a teacher by intention this time - his kids learned their primary education from someone else, and therefore didn\u2019t need to be as invested in their education because they learned enough from someone else and they thus didn\u2019t need him to anymore. He wasn\u2019t going out of his way to him anything new, but instead help him expand his knowledge on something he learned elsewhere.\n\nIs what I\u2019m saying making sense? In Shippuden, he wasn\u2019t their primary instructor anymore, and a more handsoff/lack of interest in cultivating their learning makes more sense, as he\u2019s chaperoning them as a superior officer, not as their primary source to cultivate their skills as a teacher as he should have been when they were first assigned to his team. They were novices, then, and now, they\u2019re becoming experts. It was more like a coworker helping them, or a professor helping a grad student, or a pro helping an intermediate player rather than a coach teaching a student - the lines of student-teacher were more blurred then, and more casual, as the student isn\u2019t in need of a traditional teacher where they are right now. I\u2019m glad he helped Naruto when he did, but he did so while Naruto wasn\u2019t really his student anymore, helping him hone a craft that Kakashi didn\u2019t help him learn. \n\nTLDR; I\u2019m not mad at all that Sakura and Naruto learned from the Sannin - it\u2019s just that Kakashi didn\u2019t really participate in the education as he should have before that, when he was, again, their only resource. Why is it that Kakashi only helped Naruto when he wasn\u2019t really his student anymore is what I\u2019m trying to get at, really. I\u2019m glad he helped, but it\u2019s soured by the fact that that\u2019s the _only_ time he helped He didn\u2019t help them master other basics when he had the chance to. Kishimoto wrote Kakashi as a bad and negligent teacher, really. Mostly because he forgot that they need to be taught things and kept making them learn from other people for interesting plot points that ends up making the universe less practical than it should have been.",

He did getting out the giant snake. He did when he fought Gaara and the 1 tails. He did in his last fight with Sasuke. He did fighting that bone dude that fought Lee. He literally did it *all the time.* He was always capable. He just did it a lot more often in Shippuden because in shippuden he participates in a war and fought the Akatsuki. Just because he did it more often in Shippuden doesn't mean he *couldn't* do it when he was younger. Especially when he's done it literally time and time again all the time. Hundreds of clones never been an issue for him. Never.\n\n>Kakashi isn\u2019t great with them, and after the Zabuza fight when he had low chakra, he made more than naruto did the whole series except three times. \n\nKakashi never made more clones than Naruto. Never in his entire life has he done that.",

                            "body": "Oh, Ebisu! My problem with that interaction was more to do with the fact that Kakashi wasn\u2019t there for Naruto, period. Not only did Ebisu have to teach him water walking, but didn\u2019t Jiraiya pop up at around the same time and figure out something was wrong with Naruto\u2019s chakra with how he was struggling with the exercise? Not only did Naruto have to learn a control technique from someone who wasn\u2019t his teacher, there had been something seriously wrong with him and Jiraiya only figured it out by chance! Naruto didn\u2019t know what was wrong, and no one bothered to check if he had been okay to find out for themselves. Jiraiya, again, only taught Naruto by chance. In the anime, he had to beg, and I think in the manga, Jiraiya just stumbled across him and then made him his student (which is a different issue I won\u2019t get into right now). Ebisu made it clear that he didn\u2019t like Naruto, and he wasn\u2019t exactly helping him for Naruto\u2019s own sake, and Naruto appropriately ditched him for being a shit teacher. Naruto was left to flounder on his own because Kakashi didn\u2019t care enough to do his job. Sakura is a similar issue I won\u2019t get into right now.\n\nWater walking should have come after tree-walking. People headcanon that they\u2019re subsequent teachings for a reason. Why Kakashi didn\u2019t teach them more exercises after being rushed to do so in Wave is definitely ridiculous, and Ebisu shouldn\u2019t have had to pick up the slack after they were thrown in another dangerous situation like the Exam. Unlike Wave, however, Kakashi knew ahead of time that they\u2019d be at risk of dying - just not by outliers like Orochimaru. So why he didn\u2019t better prepare them is just nonsense.\n\nThey knew Sasuke was hurt, what, with the curse seal and all, but how is it that no one took the time to fucking interrogate the survivors of the test once they knew Orochimaru had infiltrated the damn thing? Did Kakashi not ask his team all the details of how Sasuke was cursed in the first place? If he did, he would have know that Naruto was attacked. And even if you didn\u2019t ask that, how did you not just wonder if anyone else on that team got hurt? Do a basic check out if only to make sure they didn\u2019t get sick from something in the forest? \n\nKakashi has 3 people he had to look after - checkups after an incident is the bare minimum. Naruto may not have understood what was wrong with him at the time, but someone would have. Sasuke needed an immediate stop gap, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can neglect to make sure everyone _else_ was okay.\n\nAnother thing was that Kakashi had no intention of teaching Naruto shit - didn\u2019t he pass him off on Ebisu on purpose without telling him? Ebisu doesn\u2019t even _like_ Naruto! He made it clear that Naruto\u2019s education isn\u2019t something he even wants to think about, so he made it someone else\u2019s problem, and I can\u2019t help but find that to be so cruel and cold. Maybe Kakashi didn\u2019t have much lined up for Naruto, but he could have sat down with Naruto and explained that to him, and help him find a teacher to who could better help him with what _he_ needs. _That\u2019s_ how it should have gone down! Treating Naruto like he isn\u2019t important or that his needs certainly aren\u2019t important to _him_ is why Kakashi bashers focus on that scene so much - it was needlessly cruel and negligent. Passing him off to someone else like an annoying dog he never wanted - and to someone who doesn\u2019t even like dogs to begin with is, again, cruel.",

I was more talking about that situation in general, not necessarily at all throughout the story, but it\u2019s not like Kakashi took the time to go out of his way to prove that wrong, either. Sasuke was the only student Kakashi went out of his way to teach something, too - Orochimaru or not, Kakashi should have put more effort into the education earlier and more consistently. And Sasuke only got that training because he had nothing in his arsenal to fight someone as brutal as Gaara. Yes, Sasuke needed the most attention _then,_ I\u2019m not arguing that - it\u2019s just that that\u2019s the only time he gave any of them attention as the teacher he was supposed to be.\n\nWhen he was training Naruto in Shippuden, he wasn\u2019t Naruto\u2019s sole source of guidance anymore, and he wasn\u2019t doing this in that capacity, anyway. In Shippuden, Kakashi was more their chaperone than a teacher by intention this time - his kids learned their primary education from someone else, and therefore didn\u2019t need to be as invested in their education because they learned enough from someone else and they thus didn\u2019t need him to anymore. He wasn\u2019t going out of his way to him anything new, but instead help him expand his knowledge on something he learned elsewhere.\n\nIs what I\u2019m saying making sense? In Shippuden, he wasn\u2019t their primary instructor anymore, and a more handsoff/lack of interest in cultivating their learning makes more sense, as he\u2019s chaperoning them as a superior officer, not as their primary source to cultivate their skills as a teacher as he should have been when they were first assigned to his team. They were novices, then, and now, they\u2019re becoming experts. It was more like a coworker helping them, or a professor helping a grad student, or a pro helping an intermediate player rather than a coach teaching a student - the lines of student-teacher were more blurred then, and more casual, as the student isn\u2019t in need of a traditional teacher where they are right now. I\u2019m glad he helped Naruto when he did, but he did so while Naruto wasn\u2019t really his student anymore, helping him hone a craft that Kakashi didn\u2019t help him learn. \n\nTLDR; I\u2019m not mad at all that Sakura and Naruto learned from the Sannin - it\u2019s just that Kakashi didn\u2019t really participate in the education as he should have before that, when he was, again, their only resource. Why is it that Kakashi only helped Naruto when he wasn\u2019t really his student anymore is what I\u2019m trying to get at, really. I\u2019m glad he helped, but it\u2019s soured by the fact that that\u2019s the _only_ time he helped He didn\u2019t help them master other basics when he had the chance to. Kishimoto wrote Kakashi as a bad and negligent teacher, really. Mostly because he forgot that they need to be taught things and kept making them learn from other people for interesting plot points that ends up making the universe less practical than it should have been.",

                    "body": "Oh, Ebisu! My problem with that interaction was more to do with the fact that Kakashi wasn\u2019t there for Naruto, period. Not only did Ebisu have to teach him water walking, but didn\u2019t Jiraiya pop up at around the same time and figure out something was wrong with Naruto\u2019s chakra with how he was struggling with the exercise? Not only did Naruto have to learn a control technique from someone who wasn\u2019t his teacher, there had been something seriously wrong with him and Jiraiya only figured it out by chance! Naruto didn\u2019t know what was wrong, and no one bothered to check if he had been okay to find out for themselves. Jiraiya, again, only taught Naruto by chance. In the anime, he had to beg, and I think in the manga, Jiraiya just stumbled across him and then made him his student (which is a different issue I won\u2019t get into right now). Ebisu made it clear that he didn\u2019t like Naruto, and he wasn\u2019t exactly helping him for Naruto\u2019s own sake, and Naruto appropriately ditched him for being a shit teacher. Naruto was left to flounder on his own because Kakashi didn\u2019t care enough to do his job. Sakura is a similar issue I won\u2019t get into right now.\n\nWater walking should have come after tree-walking. People headcanon that they\u2019re subsequent teachings for a reason. Why Kakashi didn\u2019t teach them more exercises after being rushed to do so in Wave is definitely ridiculous, and Ebisu shouldn\u2019t have had to pick up the slack after they were thrown in another dangerous situation like the Exam. Unlike Wave, however, Kakashi knew ahead of time that they\u2019d be at risk of dying - just not by outliers like Orochimaru. So why he didn\u2019t better prepare them is just nonsense.\n\nThey knew Sasuke was hurt, what, with the curse seal and all, but how is it that no one took the time to fucking interrogate the survivors of the test once they knew Orochimaru had infiltrated the damn thing? Did Kakashi not ask his team all the details of how Sasuke was cursed in the first place? If he did, he would have know that Naruto was attacked. And even if you didn\u2019t ask that, how did you not just wonder if anyone else on that team got hurt? Do a basic check out if only to make sure they didn\u2019t get sick from something in the forest? \n\nKakashi has 3 people he had to look after - checkups after an incident is the bare minimum. Naruto may not have understood what was wrong with him at the time, but someone would have. Sasuke needed an immediate stop gap, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can neglect to make sure everyone _else_ was okay.\n\nAnother thing was that Kakashi had no intention of teaching Naruto shit - didn\u2019t he pass him off on Ebisu on purpose without telling him? Ebisu doesn\u2019t even _like_ Naruto! He made it clear that Naruto\u2019s education isn\u2019t something he even wants to think about, so he made it someone else\u2019s problem, and I can\u2019t help but find that to be so cruel and cold. Maybe Kakashi didn\u2019t have much lined up for Naruto, but he could have sat down with Naruto and explained that to him, and help him find a teacher to who could better help him with what _he_ needs. _That\u2019s_ how it should have gone down! Treating Naruto like he isn\u2019t important or that his needs certainly aren\u2019t important to _him_ is why Kakashi bashers focus on that scene so much - it was needlessly cruel and negligent. Passing him off to someone else like an annoying dog he never wanted - and to someone who doesn\u2019t even like dogs to begin with is, again, cruel.",

I was more talking about that situation in general, not necessarily at all throughout the story, but it\u2019s not like Kakashi took the time to go out of his way to prove that wrong, either. Sasuke was the only student Kakashi went out of his way to teach something, too - Orochimaru or not, Kakashi should have put more effort into the education earlier and more consistently. And Sasuke only got that training because he had nothing in his arsenal to fight someone as brutal as Gaara. Yes, Sasuke needed the most attention _then,_ I\u2019m not arguing that - it\u2019s just that that\u2019s the only time he gave any of them attention as the teacher he was supposed to be.\n\nWhen he was training Naruto in Shippuden, he wasn\u2019t Naruto\u2019s sole source of guidance anymore, and he wasn\u2019t doing this in that capacity, anyway. In Shippuden, Kakashi was more their chaperone than a teacher by intention this time - his kids learned their primary education from someone else, and therefore didn\u2019t need to be as invested in their education because they learned enough from someone else and they thus didn\u2019t need him to anymore. He wasn\u2019t going out of his way to him anything new, but instead help him expand his knowledge on something he learned elsewhere.\n\nIs what I\u2019m saying making sense? In Shippuden, he wasn\u2019t their primary instructor anymore, and a more handsoff/lack of interest in cultivating their learning makes more sense, as he\u2019s chaperoning them as a superior officer, not as their primary source to cultivate their skills as a teacher as he should have been when they were first assigned to his team. They were novices, then, and now, they\u2019re becoming experts. It was more like a coworker helping them, or a professor helping a grad student, or a pro helping an intermediate player rather than a coach teaching a student - the lines of student-teacher were more blurred then, and more casual, as the student isn\u2019t in need of a traditional teacher where they are right now. I\u2019m glad he helped Naruto when he did, but he did so while Naruto wasn\u2019t really his student anymore, helping him hone a craft that Kakashi didn\u2019t help him learn. \n\nTLDR; I\u2019m not mad at all that Sakura and Naruto learned from the Sannin - it\u2019s just that Kakashi didn\u2019t really participate in the education as he should have before that, when he was, again, their only resource. Why is it that Kakashi only helped Naruto when he wasn\u2019t really his student anymore is what I\u2019m trying to get at, really. I\u2019m glad he helped, but it\u2019s soured by the fact that that\u2019s the _only_ time he helped He didn\u2019t help them master other basics when he had the chance to. Kishimoto wrote Kakashi as a bad and negligent teacher, really. Mostly because he forgot that they need to be taught things and kept making them learn from other people for interesting plot points that ends up making the universe less practical than it should have been.",

            "body": "Oh, Ebisu! My problem with that interaction was more to do with the fact that Kakashi wasn\u2019t there for Naruto, period. Not only did Ebisu have to teach him water walking, but didn\u2019t Jiraiya pop up at around the same time and figure out something was wrong with Naruto\u2019s chakra with how he was struggling with the exercise? Not only did Naruto have to learn a control technique from someone who wasn\u2019t his teacher, there had been something seriously wrong with him and Jiraiya only figured it out by chance! Naruto didn\u2019t know what was wrong, and no one bothered to check if he had been okay to find out for themselves. Jiraiya, again, only taught Naruto by chance. In the anime, he had to beg, and I think in the manga, Jiraiya just stumbled across him and then made him his student (which is a different issue I won\u2019t get into right now). Ebisu made it clear that he didn\u2019t like Naruto, and he wasn\u2019t exactly helping him for Naruto\u2019s own sake, and Naruto appropriately ditched him for being a shit teacher. Naruto was left to flounder on his own because Kakashi didn\u2019t care enough to do his job. Sakura is a similar issue I won\u2019t get into right now.\n\nWater walking should have come after tree-walking. People headcanon that they\u2019re subsequent teachings for a reason. Why Kakashi didn\u2019t teach them more exercises after being rushed to do so in Wave is definitely ridiculous, and Ebisu shouldn\u2019t have had to pick up the slack after they were thrown in another dangerous situation like the Exam. Unlike Wave, however, Kakashi knew ahead of time that they\u2019d be at risk of dying - just not by outliers like Orochimaru. So why he didn\u2019t better prepare them is just nonsense.\n\nThey knew Sasuke was hurt, what, with the curse seal and all, but how is it that no one took the time to fucking interrogate the survivors of the test once they knew Orochimaru had infiltrated the damn thing? Did Kakashi not ask his team all the details of how Sasuke was cursed in the first place? If he did, he would have know that Naruto was attacked. And even if you didn\u2019t ask that, how did you not just wonder if anyone else on that team got hurt? Do a basic check out if only to make sure they didn\u2019t get sick from something in the forest? \n\nKakashi has 3 people he had to look after - checkups after an incident is the bare minimum. Naruto may not have understood what was wrong with him at the time, but someone would have. Sasuke needed an immediate stop gap, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can neglect to make sure everyone _else_ was okay.\n\nAnother thing was that Kakashi had no intention of teaching Naruto shit - didn\u2019t he pass him off on Ebisu on purpose without telling him? Ebisu doesn\u2019t even _like_ Naruto! He made it clear that Naruto\u2019s education isn\u2019t something he even wants to think about, so he made it someone else\u2019s problem, and I can\u2019t help but find that to be so cruel and cold. Maybe Kakashi didn\u2019t have much lined up for Naruto, but he could have sat down with Naruto and explained that to him, and help him find a teacher to who could better help him with what _he_ needs. _That\u2019s_ how it should have gone down! Treating Naruto like he isn\u2019t important or that his needs certainly aren\u2019t important to _him_ is why Kakashi bashers focus on that scene so much - it was needlessly cruel and negligent. Passing him off to someone else like an annoying dog he never wanted - and to someone who doesn\u2019t even like dogs to begin with is, again, cruel.",

Sasuke was the only student Kakashi went out of his way to teach something, too - Orochimaru or not, Kakashi should have put more effort into the education earlier and more consistently.

In Shippuden, Kakashi was more their chaperone than a teacher by intention this time - his kids learned their primary education from someone else, and therefore didn\u2019t need to be as invested in their education because they learned enough from someone else and they thus didn\u2019t need him to anymore. He wasn\u2019t going out of his way to him anything new, but instead help him expand his knowledge on something he learned elsewhere.\n\nIs what I\u2019m saying making sense? In Shippuden, he wasn\u2019t their primary instructor anymore, and a more handsoff/lack of interest in cultivating their learning makes more sense, as he\u2019s chaperoning them as a superior officer, not as their primary source to cultivate their skills as a teacher as he should have been when they were first assigned to his team.

It was more like a coworker helping them, or a professor helping a grad student, or a pro helping an intermediate player rather than a coach teaching a student - the lines of student-teacher were more blurred then, and more casual, as the student isn\u2019t in need of a traditional teacher where they are right now.

            "body": "He planned on neglecting Naruto in that instance, and without telling him about it, at that. I was more talking about that situation in general, not necessarily at all throughout the story, but it\u2019s not like Kakashi took the time to go out of his way to prove that wrong, either. Sasuke was the only student Kakashi went out of his way to teach something, too - Orochimaru or not, Kakashi should have put more effort into the education earlier and more consistently. And Sasuke only got that training because he had nothing in his arsenal to fight someone as brutal as Gaara. Yes, Sasuke needed the most attention _then,_ I\u2019m not arguing that - it\u2019s just that that\u2019s the only time he gave any of them attention as the teacher he was supposed to be.\n\nWhen he was training Naruto in Shippuden, he wasn\u2019t Naruto\u2019s sole source of guidance anymore, and he wasn\u2019t doing this in that capacity, anyway. In Shippuden, Kakashi was more their chaperone than a teacher by intention this time - his kids learned their primary education from someone else, and therefore didn\u2019t need to be as invested in their education because they learned enough from someone else and they thus didn\u2019t need him to anymore. He wasn\u2019t going out of his way to him anything new, but instead help him expand his knowledge on something he learned elsewhere.\n\nIs what I\u2019m saying making sense? In Shippuden, he wasn\u2019t their primary instructor anymore, and a more handsoff/lack of interest in cultivating their learning makes more sense, as he\u2019s chaperoning them as a superior officer, not as their primary source to cultivate their skills as a teacher as he should have been when they were first assigned to his team. They were novices, then, and now, they\u2019re becoming experts. It was more like a coworker helping them, or a professor helping a grad student, or a pro helping an intermediate player rather than a coach teaching a student - the lines of student-teacher were more blurred then, and more casual, as the student isn\u2019t in need of a traditional teacher where they are right now. I\u2019m glad he helped Naruto when he did, but he did so while Naruto wasn\u2019t really his student anymore, helping him hone a craft that Kakashi didn\u2019t help him learn. \n\nTLDR; I\u2019m not mad at all that Sakura and Naruto learned from the Sannin - it\u2019s just that Kakashi didn\u2019t really participate in the education as he should have before that, when he was, again, their only resource. Why is it that Kakashi only helped Naruto when he wasn\u2019t really his student anymore is what I\u2019m trying to get at, really. I\u2019m glad he helped, but it\u2019s soured by the fact that that\u2019s the _only_ time he helped He didn\u2019t help them master other basics when he had the chance to. Kishimoto wrote Kakashi as a bad and negligent teacher, really. Mostly because he forgot that they need to be taught things and kept making them learn from other people for interesting plot points that ends up making the universe less practical than it should have been.",

            "body": "kakashi never subdued the 9-tails by himself. The one time he did subdue it, it was by using a one-time use seal somebody else made. So during clone training, either the third hokage, fourth hokage, orochimaru, jiraya, sasuke, or Yamato would have to be there. Those are the only people to be shown to have the ability to stop the 9-tails chakra. I guess the third is a bit of a stretch but he knew every jutsu in the leaf so I\u2019m putting him in there. \n\nRegardless, my point is kakashi can\u2019t just say \u201cgo train with your clones.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t save man-power or require less people there to help when things go wrong.",
