At best Pain knew that the Kyuubi could come out which is useless information for him.\n\nHe took him down cause again he literally got a chakra refill.

Also naruto couldn\u2019t enter sage mode while he was pinned down bc the rods absorb chakra, nine tails chakra was just too op for the rods. \n\nDeva path does not beat naruto without and insanely hard fought battle. Naruto was handing pain his ass up until pain attacked grandpa frog and distracted naruto. Pain was then getting his ass kicked by nine tails. Then finally pain lost to narutos final sage mode, doesn\u2019t matter if it was 1 second he still lost, 1 second ahead in a race means you win it\u2019s no different. I love pain his probably my second favorite character and favorite villain, but your power wanking him an insane amount bro, it\u2019s literally canon that naruto bears him",

The pain arc was THE INTENDED ending point for Naruto as a series. The only real plot point that wasn't close to ending was all the Sasuke stuff, and that only happened because Kishimoto just had to push Sasuke away for a while, since his story wrapped up with Itachi. \n\nTldr: Naruto was too popular and Shonenjump gave Kishimoto a dump truck of money to continue it. That's why everything after the pain arc was so much worse than everything that came before. Though, if you ask me, it was all worth it for that scene of Sasuke forcing Oroshimaru to bring back the 1st, 2nd and 4th Hokages.  That moment when Hashirama gets angry at Tobirama for being a racist was great.",

Do you think talking to his parents ghosts and getting mini lectures from past elite shinobi is necessary? Because it's not it's just extra cannon filler so that the whole gang can have a final epic battle. He has no further development in the sasuke stuff, he continues to stick to the same guns he's had and sasuke is the one who needs to develop more. Getting rid of or befriending kurama is literally the only thing Naruto needs to do to become a completed character. We dont need to see him become hokage because him literally bringing the villiage back from the dead was enough to let us know he was well on the right track. \n\nIm not saying the war arc isn't cannon or important to the lore or not cool, im saying that lore exposition and rampant powerup fights does not = plot or character developmet. The main chatacter has completed his arc after the pain fight is my point.",

Also the Kakashi/Obito fight, and Night Guy? Those are some of the best moments of the entire franchise.\n\nI think most people can agree that the Kaguya plot should have not happened, or at least should have been pushed to Boruto.",

Every episode that had events of the actual war was something absolutely intense and most shinobi had no idea what to do. Kinda like a real war when everything is unpredictable.

Also naruto couldn\u2019t enter sage mode while he was pinned down bc the rods absorb chakra, nine tails chakra was just too op for the rods. \n\nDeva path does not beat naruto without and insanely hard fought battle. Naruto was handing pain his ass up until pain attacked grandpa frog and distracted naruto. Pain was then getting his ass kicked by nine tails. Then finally pain lost to narutos final sage mode, doesn\u2019t matter if it was 1 second he still lost, 1 second ahead in a race means you win it\u2019s no different. I love pain his probably my second favorite character and favorite villain, but your power wanking him an insane amount bro, it\u2019s literally canon that naruto bears him",

The pain arc was THE INTENDED ending point for Naruto as a series. The only real plot point that wasn't close to ending was all the Sasuke stuff, and that only happened because Kishimoto just had to push Sasuke away for a while, since his story wrapped up with Itachi. \n\nTldr: Naruto was too popular and Shonenjump gave Kishimoto a dump truck of money to continue it. That's why everything after the pain arc was so much worse than everything that came before. Though, if you ask me, it was all worth it for that scene of Sasuke forcing Oroshimaru to bring back the 1st, 2nd and 4th Hokages.  That moment when Hashirama gets angry at Tobirama for being a racist was great.",

Do you think talking to his parents ghosts and getting mini lectures from past elite shinobi is necessary? Because it's not it's just extra cannon filler so that the whole gang can have a final epic battle. He has no further development in the sasuke stuff, he continues to stick to the same guns he's had and sasuke is the one who needs to develop more. Getting rid of or befriending kurama is literally the only thing Naruto needs to do to become a completed character. We dont need to see him become hokage because him literally bringing the villiage back from the dead was enough to let us know he was well on the right track. \n\nIm not saying the war arc isn't cannon or important to the lore or not cool, im saying that lore exposition and rampant powerup fights does not = plot or character developmet.

Also the Kakashi/Obito fight, and Night Guy? Those are some of the best moments of the entire franchise.\n\nI think most people can agree that the Kaguya plot should have not happened, or at least should have been pushed to Boruto.",

Also minato didn\u2019t refill his chakra naruto just re-entered sage mode while he was on the planetary devastation, you can\u2019t say Minato gave him chakra bc nowhere in the episode doesn\u2019t it mention anything about that, you\u2019re just making a huge speculation. Also naruto couldn\u2019t enter sage mode while he was pinned down bc the rods absorb chakra, nine tails chakra was just too op for the rods. \n\nDeva path does not beat naruto without and insanely hard fought battle. Naruto was handing pain his ass up until pain attacked grandpa frog and distracted naruto. Pain was then getting his ass kicked by nine tails. Then finally pain lost to narutos final sage mode, doesn\u2019t matter if it was 1 second he still lost, 1 second ahead in a race means you win it\u2019s no different. I love pain his probably my second favorite character and favorite villain, but your power wanking him an insane amount bro, it\u2019s literally canon that naruto bears him",

The pain arc was THE INTENDED ending point for Naruto as a series. The only real plot point that wasn't close to ending was all the Sasuke stuff, and that only happened because Kishimoto just had to push Sasuke away for a while, since his story wrapped up with Itachi. \n\nTldr: Naruto was too popular and Shonenjump gave Kishimoto a dump truck of money to continue it. That's why everything after the pain arc was so much worse than everything that came before. Though, if you ask me, it was all worth it for that scene of Sasuke forcing Oroshimaru to bring back the 1st, 2nd and 4th Hokages.  That moment when Hashirama gets angry at Tobirama for being a racist was great.",

Because it's not it's just extra cannon filler so that the whole gang can have a final epic battle. He has no further development in the sasuke stuff, he continues to stick to the same guns he's had and sasuke is the one who needs to develop more. Getting rid of or befriending kurama is literally the only thing Naruto needs to do to become a completed character. We dont need to see him become hokage because him literally bringing the villiage back from the dead was enough to let us know he was well on the right track. \n\nIm not saying the war arc isn't cannon or important to the lore or not cool, im saying that lore exposition and rampant powerup fights does not = plot or character developmet.

Like hinata really didn\u2019t even help him. Also minato didn\u2019t refill his chakra naruto just re-entered sage mode while he was on the planetary devastation, you can\u2019t say Minato gave him chakra bc nowhere in the episode doesn\u2019t it mention anything about that, you\u2019re just making a huge speculation. Also naruto couldn\u2019t enter sage mode while he was pinned down bc the rods absorb chakra, nine tails chakra was just too op for the rods. \n\nDeva path does not beat naruto without and insanely hard fought battle. Naruto was handing pain his ass up until pain attacked grandpa frog and distracted naruto. Pain was then getting his ass kicked by nine tails. Then finally pain lost to narutos final sage mode, doesn\u2019t matter if it was 1 second he still lost, 1 second ahead in a race means you win it\u2019s no different. I love pain his probably my second favorite character and favorite villain, but your power wanking him an insane amount bro, it\u2019s literally canon that naruto bears him",

The pain arc was THE INTENDED ending point for Naruto as a series. The only real plot point that wasn't close to ending was all the Sasuke stuff, and that only happened because Kishimoto just had to push Sasuke away for a while, since his story wrapped up with Itachi. \n\nTldr: Naruto was too popular and Shonenjump gave Kishimoto a dump truck of money to continue it. That's why everything after the pain arc was so much worse than everything that came before. Though, if you ask me, it was all worth it for that scene of Sasuke forcing Oroshimaru to bring back the 1st, 2nd and 4th Hokages.  That moment when Hashirama gets angry at Tobirama for being a racist was great.",

Getting rid of or befriending kurama is literally the only thing Naruto needs to do to become a completed character. We dont need to see him become hokage because him literally bringing the villiage back from the dead was enough to let us know he was well on the right track. \n\nIm not saying the war arc isn't cannon or important to the lore or not cool, im saying that lore exposition and rampant powerup fights does not = plot or character developmet.

Do you think talking to his parents ghosts and getting mini lectures from past elite shinobi is necessary? Because it's not it's just extra cannon filler so that the whole gang can have a final epic battle. He has no further development in the sasuke stuff, he continues to stick to the same guns he's had and sasuke is the one who needs to develop more. Getting rid of or befriending kurama is literally the only thing Naruto needs to do to become a completed character. We dont need to see him become hokage because him literally bringing the villiage back from the dead was enough to let us know he was well on the right track. \n\nIm not saying the war arc isn't cannon or important to the lore or not cool, im saying that lore exposition and rampant powerup fights does not = plot or character developmet. The main chatacter has completed his arc after the pain fight is my point.",

At best Pain knew that the Kyuubi could come out which is useless information for him.\n\nHe took him down cause again he literally got a chakra refill.

Getting rid of or befriending kurama is literally the only thing Naruto needs to do to become a completed character. We dont need to see him become hokage because him literally bringing the villiage back from the dead was enough to let us know he was well on the right track. \n\nIm not saying the war arc isn't cannon or important to the lore or not cool, im saying that lore exposition and rampant powerup fights does not = plot or character developmet.

Getting rid of or befriending kurama is literally the only thing Naruto needs to do to become a completed character. We dont need to see him become hokage because him literally bringing the villiage back from the dead was enough to let us know he was well on the right track. \n\nIm not saying the war arc isn't cannon or important to the lore or not cool, im saying that lore exposition and rampant powerup fights does not = plot or character developmet.

Naruto lost and if he fought against a fresh Pain it would\u2019ve been even worse.",

He didn't have anything but his Sage Mode then, and Pain still had his power.\n\nAlso, what chakra refill? Neither Minato nor Kurama gave him any \"refills\".",

At best Pain knew that the Kyuubi could come out which is useless information for him.\n\nHe took him down cause again he literally got a chakra refill. Minato after he resealed Kurama refilled Naruto\u2019s chakra supply somehow which is how he reentered Sage Mode (which I guess we can explain it by saying that Minato was also a perfect Sage with information we know now)",

Also naruto couldn\u2019t enter sage mode while he was pinned down bc the rods absorb chakra, nine tails chakra was just too op for the rods. \n\nDeva path does not beat naruto without and insanely hard fought battle. Naruto was handing pain his ass up until pain attacked grandpa frog and distracted naruto. Pain was then getting his ass kicked by nine tails. Then finally pain lost to narutos final sage mode, doesn\u2019t matter if it was 1 second he still lost, 1 second ahead in a race means you win it\u2019s no different.

Getting rid of or befriending kurama is literally the only thing Naruto needs to do to become a completed character. We dont need to see him become hokage because him literally bringing the villiage back from the dead was enough to let us know he was well on the right track. \n\nIm not saying the war arc isn't cannon or important to the lore or not cool, im saying that lore exposition and rampant powerup fights does not = plot or character developmet.

Like hinata really didn\u2019t even help him.

Also naruto couldn\u2019t enter sage mode while he was pinned down bc the rods absorb chakra, nine tails chakra was just too op for the rods. \n\nDeva path does not beat naruto without and insanely hard fought battle. Naruto was handing pain his ass up until pain attacked grandpa frog and distracted naruto. Pain was then getting his ass kicked by nine tails. Then finally pain lost to narutos final sage mode, doesn\u2019t matter if it was 1 second he still lost, 1 second ahead in a race means you win it\u2019s no different. I love pain his probably my second favorite character and favorite villain, but your power wanking him an insane amount bro, it\u2019s literally canon that naruto bears him",

Also naruto couldn\u2019t enter sage mode while he was pinned down bc the rods absorb chakra, nine tails chakra was just too op for the rods. \n\nDeva path does not beat naruto without and insanely hard fought battle. Naruto was handing pain his ass up until pain attacked grandpa frog and distracted naruto. Pain was then getting his ass kicked by nine tails. Then finally pain lost to narutos final sage mode, doesn\u2019t matter if it was 1 second he still lost, 1 second ahead in a race means you win it\u2019s no different. I love pain his probably my second favorite character and favorite villain, but your power wanking him an insane amount bro, it\u2019s literally canon that naruto bears him",
