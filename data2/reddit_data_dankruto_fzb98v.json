I dont hate Itachi I actually like him but wished he was written better. I want to believe what he did was right but at the end his choices were far from the best. I admit I am bitter to the fact that Itachi let that girl die, the one who had feelings for him. Not everyone wanted a rebellion and those who did could be persuaded. I mean was there a need to kill the children? It was selfish to not want to lose Sasuke but kill everyone else who hold the same feelings for their loved ones. I left a short debate in the comments somewhere here explaining more why I dislike the way his character was written if you want you could read that",

Because he was so vehemently against the idea of a civil war that would leave the village open to its enemies, and so jaded by Danzo and his time in Root that a peaceful solution was impossible, he felt that this was the only way forward. One of the last things he ever does is express regret for the decision that he made. I don't like Itachi because he was right, I like him because he's such a tragic villain.\n\nAll that said though, Itachi's actions make a lot more sense when you look at the story through the lens of the world being a hopelessly dark, depressing, war-torn hellscape rather than the post-Naruto world where Talk no Jutsu is an effective combat technique. In a realpolitik sense, Itachi still wasn't necessarily *right*, but he wasn't *wrong*, either.\n\nP.S. Just wanted to point out that Minato died almost a decade before the Uchiha Clan Massacre",

A war that would have ravaged the nation while also leaving Konoha open to attack from other villages resulting in a massive lose of live and possibly resulting in the 4th Great Ninja War. Then there was the second option, do whatever he needed to do in order to stop the uprising. Sadly, the only way in the end was to slaughter his clan. He was only able to save Sasuke's life due to the knowledge he had and him agreeing to be a Konoha spy in the Akatsuki. He made great sacrifices for the greater good, the only thing he would not sacrifice was his little brother. This isnt about what is just, it was about the better option, which choice would lead to less loss of life. Itachi loved the village as much as his clan, if not more, but he knew what the Uchiha were doing was wrong.",

He chose Sasuke over everything else. He joined the Akatsuki to spy on them yet he never brought forth any Intel or took out any of those rogue ninjas who were a direct threat to Sasuke, Konoha and the world. He literally had Orochimaru wanting to take over an Uchia body, right in front of him,and h only cut off one arm, instead of killing him as both an enemy to konoha and a potential threat to Sasuke. He didnt do absolutely anything about \" Madara\" and only aided a terrorist organization in killing off people and getting closer to their goal of creating a super power for massive destruction and death. Some pacifist and never tell anyone about the presence of \"Madara\". He never did anything to change the relationship between Konoah and Uchia, despite being very aware of the planning of the violent coup and being a technical \"pacifist\". We can say it's for the greater good and all but I cant say its ultimately justified. He helped Naruto because of a pre-programmed mind control he had put on Naruto in order to continue manipulating his brother after purposefully setting him on the path of revenge for no other reason than his own selfish wishes. He mind raped Sasuke twice, told him to *kill his best friend* , and did all of that just because he wanted for Sasuke to take him down and make him a \"hero\". Except all that fucked with Sasukes already tormented mind. His entire reason for prolonging his life was for Sasuke to beat him, nothing more. He is absolved for all the bad things he did and praised as a martyr for killing his entire clan and innocents",

There are always 3 sides to a story. 2 sides against eachother and a neutral party that tells the truth, Itachi heard from the 2 sides against each other. He didnt want to see another war since he was traumatized from the previous one so when the elders said \"to protect the village or the wrongful Uchia\" of course he'd believe the elders since he absolutely didn't want another war since he saw first hand the horrors of what it brought.

Kishimoto obviously wanted Itachi to be the epitome of what a shinobi should be with self sacrifice but the way it was written with Itachis choices, made me dislike his methods. But Itachi had a noble heart in the end so I find it hard to believe that he would kill his entire clan while knowing that the elders were in the wrong for falsely accusing the Uchia for the 9 tails attack and allowing that rumour to spread causing many other people to doubt them. Besides the way Kishimoto portrayed the event and the dealings of Danzo and the stubbornness of the elders aswell as the way Danzo handled things it wouldn't be far fetched to say Itachi was manipulated. I said this before in one of the previous replies to someone else but if Itachi went and told Sarutobi what Danzo planned, he would have convinced Itachi to side with him and with the support of Sarutobi and the famed and influential Uchia, son of the leader Fugaku, they both could have convinced the Uchia to a peaceful outcome. If lord 3rd knew about Danzos plans than Shisui might have also survived and he would side with Itachi and Sarutobi with that many influential people the Uchia could have been persuaded to stand down...but that's IF Itachi made the right choice and told Sarutobi Hiruzen",

Sasuke was only saved because Itachi said that if Sasuke was killed he would release all of the knowledge he has on Konoha and Danzo to the world. You say he did nothing while he was a spy? You must have also forgotten that the only person who knew he was a spy was Sarutobi. After Sarutobi died, there was no one to relay information to. So from there on Itachi kept to his own plan he had for Sasuke and did his best to prepare him for what was to come.

Don't you think that Naruto lasted far too long without being captured by one of the greatest minds in the entire show? Not only that, Itachi had power comparable to Jiraiya even though he was terminally Ill. Along with Kisame who had strength comparable to the tailed beasts as well. Why do you think Naruto was never captured? Also, genius or not, Itachi was not going to pass vital information to anyone he did not absolutely trust. The only person he trusted with his brothers life was dead. Why would he risk information falling into Danzo's hands? Itachi was genius, only surpassed in raw intellect by Shikamaru, yet there are so many unknown variables in life that are impossible to fully account for. So faulting someone for not being able to perfectly plan and manipulate everyone in the show is just ignorant. Itachi did what he could with what he had, if it were literally anyone else, even Shikamaru, Sasuke would have been killed in the first season by Danzo, if not before then.",

He needed Sasuke to grow strong enough to defend himself and not worry about his older brother.

Faking his own death would only put Sasuke in danger. Remember Danzo wanted to kill Sasuke and take his eyes. Itachi being alive was the only thing keeping Sasuke safe. Which is why he put Sasuke down that path, great love followed by great pain and loss increases the strength of the Sharingan and is what awakens the next level.",

They were a large and cohesive clan, starting a civil war was not their only option. They could have formally protested en masse. The military police of the village was entirely Uchiha, they could have threatened to strike and leave the rest of the village in anarchy if their demands were ignored. They could have left Konoha and founded their own village.\n\n\nStarting a civil war wasn't their only option, but it was the most violent and would have resulted in civilian casualties even if other villages didn't take the opportunity to start a war with the weakened Konoha. \n\nThat being said, the Second Hokage's actions and the blame for the Nine Tails' attack obviously led to resentment and I understand the Uchiha's desire for revenge and power. Still, that doesn't justify war in my opinion.",

He had no choice in the matter. \n\n> They proved that O ly way for Uchihas to live in dignity was when Holage was an Uchiha\n\nSo they could have either: 1) Overthrown the current regime and forcibly taken power, leading to the entire rest of the village resenting them and continued the cycle of hate, subversion and violence, or 2) left and formed their own village. I just can't see how option 2 is not the right way to go. They have one of the most powerful Kekkei Genkai, they could have defended themselves, and besides, the Leaf was doing nothing to defend them as you said, so regardless founding their own village would have granted them autonomy *and* greater security.",

After the byuakugan user notices Shisui's eyes chakra at the Five Kage summit everyone knows they were manipulated by Danzo. So I don't think he could use Shisui's eye to manipulate the Hyuga. And since the Hyuga were part of the leaf that were fine with discriminating the Uchiha, I think they would go straight to Danzo/ the Third Hokage and tell them that Itachi tried to manipulate then with Shisui's eye. Even if the Hyuga weren't involved, if Itachi showed that he wouldn't take one of Danzo's two options, would Danzo not just Komoatsukami Itachi first?\n\nAnyways I don't think it would go so smoothly. A civil war would probably result from your scenario. You're arguing for Itachi to side with his clan and stage a coup with extra steps. Both sides would have opportunities to use Shisui's eyes. The resulting political instability and civil unrest would leave the village vulnerable to foreign enemies.",

I dont hate Itachi I actually like him but wished he was written better. I want to believe what he did was right but at the end his choices were far from the best. I admit I am bitter to the fact that Itachi let that girl die, the one who had feelings for him. Not everyone wanted a rebellion and those who did could be persuaded. I mean was there a need to kill the children? It was selfish to not want to lose Sasuke but kill everyone else who hold the same feelings for their loved ones. I left a short debate in the comments somewhere here explaining more why I dislike the way his character was written if you want you could read that",

Because he was so vehemently against the idea of a civil war that would leave the village open to its enemies, and so jaded by Danzo and his time in Root that a peaceful solution was impossible, he felt that this was the only way forward. One of the last things he ever does is express regret for the decision that he made. I don't like Itachi because he was right, I like him because he's such a tragic villain.\n\nAll that said though, Itachi's actions make a lot more sense when you look at the story through the lens of the world being a hopelessly dark, depressing, war-torn hellscape rather than the post-Naruto world where Talk no Jutsu is an effective combat technique. In a realpolitik sense, Itachi still wasn't necessarily *right*, but he wasn't *wrong*, either.\n\nP.S. Just wanted to point out that Minato died almost a decade before the Uchiha Clan Massacre",

A war that would have ravaged the nation while also leaving Konoha open to attack from other villages resulting in a massive lose of live and possibly resulting in the 4th Great Ninja War. Then there was the second option, do whatever he needed to do in order to stop the uprising. Sadly, the only way in the end was to slaughter his clan. He was only able to save Sasuke's life due to the knowledge he had and him agreeing to be a Konoha spy in the Akatsuki. He made great sacrifices for the greater good, the only thing he would not sacrifice was his little brother. This isnt about what is just, it was about the better option, which choice would lead to less loss of life. Itachi loved the village as much as his clan, if not more, but he knew what the Uchiha were doing was wrong.",

He chose Sasuke over everything else. He joined the Akatsuki to spy on them yet he never brought forth any Intel or took out any of those rogue ninjas who were a direct threat to Sasuke, Konoha and the world. He literally had Orochimaru wanting to take over an Uchia body, right in front of him,and h only cut off one arm, instead of killing him as both an enemy to konoha and a potential threat to Sasuke. He didnt do absolutely anything about \" Madara\" and only aided a terrorist organization in killing off people and getting closer to their goal of creating a super power for massive destruction and death. Some pacifist and never tell anyone about the presence of \"Madara\". He never did anything to change the relationship between Konoah and Uchia, despite being very aware of the planning of the violent coup and being a technical \"pacifist\". We can say it's for the greater good and all but I cant say its ultimately justified. He helped Naruto because of a pre-programmed mind control he had put on Naruto in order to continue manipulating his brother after purposefully setting him on the path of revenge for no other reason than his own selfish wishes. He mind raped Sasuke twice, told him to *kill his best friend* , and did all of that just because he wanted for Sasuke to take him down and make him a \"hero\". Except all that fucked with Sasukes already tormented mind. His entire reason for prolonging his life was for Sasuke to beat him, nothing more. He is absolved for all the bad things he did and praised as a martyr for killing his entire clan and innocents",

Besides the way Kishimoto portrayed the event and the dealings of Danzo and the stubbornness of the elders aswell as the way Danzo handled things it wouldn't be far fetched to say Itachi was manipulated. I said this before in one of the previous replies to someone else but if Itachi went and told Sarutobi what Danzo planned, he would have convinced Itachi to side with him and with the support of Sarutobi and the famed and influential Uchia, son of the leader Fugaku, they both could have convinced the Uchia to a peaceful outcome. If lord 3rd knew about Danzos plans than Shisui might have also survived and he would side with Itachi and Sarutobi with that many influential people the Uchia could have been persuaded to stand down...but that's IF Itachi made the right choice and told Sarutobi Hiruzen",

Sasuke was only saved because Itachi said that if Sasuke was killed he would release all of the knowledge he has on Konoha and Danzo to the world. You say he did nothing while he was a spy? You must have also forgotten that the only person who knew he was a spy was Sarutobi. After Sarutobi died, there was no one to relay information to. So from there on Itachi kept to his own plan he had for Sasuke and did his best to prepare him for what was to come.

Faking his own death would only put Sasuke in danger. Remember Danzo wanted to kill Sasuke and take his eyes. Itachi being alive was the only thing keeping Sasuke safe.

They were a large and cohesive clan, starting a civil war was not their only option. They could have formally protested en masse. The military police of the village was entirely Uchiha, they could have threatened to strike and leave the rest of the village in anarchy if their demands were ignored. They could have left Konoha and founded their own village.\n\n\nStarting a civil war wasn't their only option, but it was the most violent and would have resulted in civilian casualties even if other villages didn't take the opportunity to start a war with the weakened Konoha. \n\nThat being said, the Second Hokage's actions and the blame for the Nine Tails' attack obviously led to resentment and I understand the Uchiha's desire for revenge and power.

He had no choice in the matter. \n\n> They proved that O ly way for Uchihas to live in dignity was when Holage was an Uchiha\n\nSo they could have either: 1) Overthrown the current regime and forcibly taken power, leading to the entire rest of the village resenting them and continued the cycle of hate, subversion and violence, or 2) left and formed their own village. I just can't see how option 2 is not the right way to go. They have one of the most powerful Kekkei Genkai, they could have defended themselves, and besides, the Leaf was doing nothing to defend them as you said, so regardless founding their own village would have granted them autonomy *and* greater security.",

Itachi could also sacrifice himself. Sympathy among lead for Uchiha woudl rise further and they would get what they wanted. \n\nThere are even more ways. Dozens more. \n\nItachi is not innocent. Danzk may have ordered him but he ultimately killed his blood.\n\nYou could also kill Third. Make Danzo the Hokage. Make him a terrible and evil man publicly. Fugaku kills him and becomes village hero. Itachi dies saving lead from a evil man. \n\nThere were so many ways. Itachi is a terrible person. He deserves to burn in hell.\n\nHe could have asked Kakashi for help. He could have asked Yamato as well. He had so, so, so many options and he chose genocide.",

Also I'm pretty sure a council from the Land of Fire appoints the hokages anyways. \n\nBut Itachi was 13 years old when he was told by his superiors on both sides that there were only two choices. How is a literal child supposed to come up with these plots on a very limited time scale? His entire life he was guided to believe that he could choose either the village or the clan.\n\n> He could have forced negotiations.\n\nYou said the negotiations had already failed. Danzo had one of Shisui's eyes, he would have recognized that Itachi was using the other to force negotiations and stop them, or used the Shisui eye he had to reverse either the Uchihas desire to negotiate, or to make the Leaf elite unwilling to negotiate.",

Uses Komoatsukami on him. Danzo can't escape from it. It's completely unbreakable. Danzo, did not suspect Itachi in real story either. He believed story of suicide and was satisfied with Shisuis body never being found. \n\nThrough Danzo, Itachi has entire Root and Anbu under his direct control. Take Shisuis other eye and go to Hyuga. Use it on them and make them allied to Uchiha. \n\nGo to Fugaku, lie to him that Shisui is a traitor and that Itachi killed him. Tell him that Danzo and Hyuga are allies. \n\nGo to Third, arrange a meeting. Plan a fake attack by Danzo and Entire Root on Third. Uchihas will fight them back. Blame everything on Danzo and have him kill Third publicly. Make him a traitorous dictator. \n\nFugaku kills him. And becomes new Hokage. \nHyuga support Uchihas. Kakashi is also allied. Anbu is allied. Third has become a martyr and Uchihas are heroes. \n\nUnveil all deeds to Danzo and how he harmed Leaf and Uchiha. Publicly make Shisui a hero who saved leaf. \n\nI could think and even better Secenrio. Only a few people would die in this scenario.\n\nGet my gist.

After the byuakugan user notices Shisui's eyes chakra at the Five Kage summit everyone knows they were manipulated by Danzo. So I don't think he could use Shisui's eye to manipulate the Hyuga. And since the Hyuga were part of the leaf that were fine with discriminating the Uchiha, I think they would go straight to Danzo/ the Third Hokage and tell them that Itachi tried to manipulate then with Shisui's eye. Even if the Hyuga weren't involved, if Itachi showed that he wouldn't take one of Danzo's two options, would Danzo not just Komoatsukami Itachi first?\n\nAnyways I don't think it would go so smoothly. A civil war would probably result from your scenario. You're arguing for Itachi to side with his clan and stage a coup with extra steps. Both sides would have opportunities to use Shisui's eyes. The resulting political instability and civil unrest would leave the village vulnerable to foreign enemies.",

I dont hate Itachi I actually like him but wished he was written better. I want to believe what he did was right but at the end his choices were far from the best. I admit I am bitter to the fact that Itachi let that girl die, the one who had feelings for him. Not everyone wanted a rebellion and those who did could be persuaded. I mean was there a need to kill the children? It was selfish to not want to lose Sasuke but kill everyone else who hold the same feelings for their loved ones.

One of the last things he ever does is express regret for the decision that he made. I don't like Itachi because he was right, I like him because he's such a tragic villain.\n\nAll that said though, Itachi's actions make a lot more sense when you look at the story through the lens of the world being a hopelessly dark, depressing, war-torn hellscape rather than the post-Naruto world where Talk no Jutsu is an effective combat technique. In a realpolitik sense, Itachi still wasn't necessarily *right*, but he wasn't *wrong*, either.\n\nP.S. Just wanted to point out that Minato died almost a decade before the Uchiha Clan Massacre",

He chose Sasuke over everything else. He joined the Akatsuki to spy on them yet he never brought forth any Intel or took out any of those rogue ninjas who were a direct threat to Sasuke, Konoha and the world. He literally had Orochimaru wanting to take over an Uchia body, right in front of him,and h only cut off one arm, instead of killing him as both an enemy to konoha and a potential threat to Sasuke. He didnt do absolutely anything about \" Madara\" and only aided a terrorist organization in killing off people and getting closer to their goal of creating a super power for massive destruction and death. Some pacifist and never tell anyone about the presence of \"Madara\". He never did anything to change the relationship between Konoah and Uchia, despite being very aware of the planning of the violent coup and being a technical \"pacifist\". We can say it's for the greater good and all but I cant say its ultimately justified. He helped Naruto because of a pre-programmed mind control he had put on Naruto in order to continue manipulating his brother after purposefully setting him on the path of revenge for no other reason than his own selfish wishes. He mind raped Sasuke twice, told him to *kill his best friend* , and did all of that just because he wanted for Sasuke to take him down and make him a \"hero\". Except all that fucked with Sasukes already tormented mind. His entire reason for prolonging his life was for Sasuke to beat him, nothing more. He is absolved for all the bad things he did and praised as a martyr for killing his entire clan and innocents",

Besides the way Kishimoto portrayed the event and the dealings of Danzo and the stubbornness of the elders aswell as the way Danzo handled things it wouldn't be far fetched to say Itachi was manipulated. I said this before in one of the previous replies to someone else but if Itachi went and told Sarutobi what Danzo planned, he would have convinced Itachi to side with him and with the support of Sarutobi and the famed and influential Uchia, son of the leader Fugaku, they both could have convinced the Uchia to a peaceful outcome. If lord 3rd knew about Danzos plans than Shisui might have also survived and he would side with Itachi and Sarutobi with that many influential people the Uchia could have been persuaded to stand down...but that's IF Itachi made the right choice and told Sarutobi Hiruzen",

You must have also forgotten that the only person who knew he was a spy was Sarutobi. After Sarutobi died, there was no one to relay information to.

They were a large and cohesive clan, starting a civil war was not their only option. They could have formally protested en masse. The military police of the village was entirely Uchiha, they could have threatened to strike and leave the rest of the village in anarchy if their demands were ignored. They could have left Konoha and founded their own village.\n\n\nStarting a civil war wasn't their only option, but it was the most violent and would have resulted in civilian casualties even if other villages didn't take the opportunity to start a war with the weakened Konoha. \n\nThat being said, the Second Hokage's actions and the blame for the Nine Tails' attack obviously led to resentment and I understand the Uchiha's desire for revenge and power. Still, that doesn't justify war in my opinion.",

He had no choice in the matter. \n\n> They proved that O ly way for Uchihas to live in dignity was when Holage was an Uchiha\n\nSo they could have either: 1) Overthrown the current regime and forcibly taken power, leading to the entire rest of the village resenting them and continued the cycle of hate, subversion and violence, or 2) left and formed their own village. I just can't see how option 2 is not the right way to go. They have one of the most powerful Kekkei Genkai, they could have defended themselves, and besides, the Leaf was doing nothing to defend them as you said, so regardless founding their own village would have granted them autonomy *and* greater security.",

Everyone is happy. \n\nToy could possibly make the attack by Danzo more deveststing. Involved Naruto. Make it seem like Danzo tries to use 9 tails and Itachi killed him. Itachi could also sacrifice himself. Sympathy among lead for Uchiha woudl rise further and they would get what they wanted. \n\nThere are even more ways. Dozens more. \n\nItachi is not innocent. Danzk may have ordered him but he ultimately killed his blood.\n\nYou could also kill Third. Make Danzo the Hokage. Make him a terrible and evil man publicly. Fugaku kills him and becomes village hero. Itachi dies saving lead from a evil man. \n\nThere were so many ways. Itachi is a terrible person. He deserves to burn in hell.\n\nHe could have asked Kakashi for help. He could have asked Yamato as well. He had so, so, so many options and he chose genocide.",

How is a literal child supposed to come up with these plots on a very limited time scale? His entire life he was guided to believe that he could choose either the village or the clan.\n\n> He could have forced negotiations.\n\nYou said the negotiations had already failed. Danzo had one of Shisui's eyes, he would have recognized that Itachi was using the other to force negotiations and stop them, or used the Shisui eye he had to reverse either the Uchihas desire to negotiate, or to make the Leaf elite unwilling to negotiate.",

Uses Komoatsukami on him. Danzo can't escape from it. It's completely unbreakable. Danzo, did not suspect Itachi in real story either. He believed story of suicide and was satisfied with Shisuis body never being found. \n\nThrough Danzo, Itachi has entire Root and Anbu under his direct control. Take Shisuis other eye and go to Hyuga. Use it on them and make them allied to Uchiha. \n\nGo to Fugaku, lie to him that Shisui is a traitor and that Itachi killed him. Tell him that Danzo and Hyuga are allies. \n\nGo to Third, arrange a meeting. Plan a fake attack by Danzo and Entire Root on Third. Uchihas will fight them back. Blame everything on Danzo and have him kill Third publicly. Make him a traitorous dictator. \n\nFugaku kills him. And becomes new Hokage. \nHyuga support Uchihas. Kakashi is also allied. Anbu is allied. Third has become a martyr and Uchihas are heroes. \n\nUnveil all deeds to Danzo and how he harmed Leaf and Uchiha. Publicly make Shisui a hero who saved leaf. \n\nI could think and even better Secenrio. Only a few people would die in this scenario.\n\nGet my gist.

After the byuakugan user notices Shisui's eyes chakra at the Five Kage summit everyone knows they were manipulated by Danzo. So I don't think he could use Shisui's eye to manipulate the Hyuga. And since the Hyuga were part of the leaf that were fine with discriminating the Uchiha, I think they would go straight to Danzo/ the Third Hokage and tell them that Itachi tried to manipulate then with Shisui's eye. Even if the Hyuga weren't involved, if Itachi showed that he wouldn't take one of Danzo's two options, would Danzo not just Komoatsukami Itachi first?\n\nAnyways I don't think it would go so smoothly. A civil war would probably result from your scenario. You're arguing for Itachi to side with his clan and stage a coup with extra steps. Both sides would have opportunities to use Shisui's eyes. The resulting political instability and civil unrest would leave the village vulnerable to foreign enemies.",

Because he was so vehemently against the idea of a civil war that would leave the village open to its enemies, and so jaded by Danzo and his time in Root that a peaceful solution was impossible, he felt that this was the only way forward. One of the last things he ever does is express regret for the decision that he made. I don't like Itachi because he was right, I like him because he's such a tragic villain.\n\nAll that said though, Itachi's actions make a lot more sense when you look at the story through the lens of the world being a hopelessly dark, depressing, war-torn hellscape rather than the post-Naruto world where Talk no Jutsu is an effective combat technique. In a realpolitik sense, Itachi still wasn't necessarily *right*, but he wasn't *wrong*, either.\n\nP.S. Just wanted to point out that Minato died almost a decade before the Uchiha Clan Massacre",

Graduation, marrying Itachi, children, etc. You gotta admit, his heart was in it considering how he killed his parents. And Itachi\u2019s a pacifist, so no matter what, he never truly wanted to kill all the people he did that day. I honestly blame the Hokages\u2019 plot induced stupidity on the situation and Danzo.",

Maybe Itachi was traumatized from the previous war he witnessed and didnt want another one and he was an anubu so it was easy for the people whom he swore loyalty to, the village leaders, to manipulate him in a way. Wow really? That eases me a bit that he did that for her but I still have my regrets",

Kishimoto obviously wanted Itachi to be the epitome of what a shinobi should be with self sacrifice but the way it was written with Itachis choices, made me dislike his methods. But Itachi had a noble heart in the end so I find it hard to believe that he would kill his entire clan while knowing that the elders were in the wrong for falsely accusing the Uchia for the 9 tails attack and allowing that rumour to spread causing many other people to doubt them. Besides the way Kishimoto portrayed the event and the dealings of Danzo and the stubbornness of the elders aswell as the way Danzo handled things it wouldn't be far fetched to say Itachi was manipulated. I said this before in one of the previous replies to someone else but if Itachi went and told Sarutobi what Danzo planned, he would have convinced Itachi to side with him and with the support of Sarutobi and the famed and influential Uchia, son of the leader Fugaku, they both could have convinced the Uchia to a peaceful outcome. If lord 3rd knew about Danzos plans than Shisui might have also survived and he would side with Itachi and Sarutobi with that many influential people the Uchia could have been persuaded to stand down...but that's IF Itachi made the right choice and told Sarutobi Hiruzen",

Sasuke was only saved because Itachi said that if Sasuke was killed he would release all of the knowledge he has on Konoha and Danzo to the world. You say he did nothing while he was a spy? You must have also forgotten that the only person who knew he was a spy was Sarutobi. After Sarutobi died, there was no one to relay information to. So from there on Itachi kept to his own plan he had for Sasuke and did his best to prepare him for what was to come.

They were a large and cohesive clan, starting a civil war was not their only option. They could have formally protested en masse. The military police of the village was entirely Uchiha, they could have threatened to strike and leave the rest of the village in anarchy if their demands were ignored. They could have left Konoha and founded their own village.\n\n\nStarting a civil war wasn't their only option, but it was the most violent and would have resulted in civilian casualties even if other villages didn't take the opportunity to start a war with the weakened Konoha. \n\nThat being said, the Second Hokage's actions and the blame for the Nine Tails' attack obviously led to resentment and I understand the Uchiha's desire for revenge and power. Still, that doesn't justify war in my opinion.",

He had no choice in the matter. \n\n> They proved that O ly way for Uchihas to live in dignity was when Holage was an Uchiha\n\nSo they could have either: 1) Overthrown the current regime and forcibly taken power, leading to the entire rest of the village resenting them and continued the cycle of hate, subversion and violence, or 2) left and formed their own village. I just can't see how option 2 is not the right way to go. They have one of the most powerful Kekkei Genkai, they could have defended themselves, and besides, the Leaf was doing nothing to defend them as you said, so regardless founding their own village would have granted them autonomy *and* greater security.",

Super Genius Itachi commutes genocide when other ways were possible.",

After the byuakugan user notices Shisui's eyes chakra at the Five Kage summit everyone knows they were manipulated by Danzo. So I don't think he could use Shisui's eye to manipulate the Hyuga. And since the Hyuga were part of the leaf that were fine with discriminating the Uchiha, I think they would go straight to Danzo/ the Third Hokage and tell them that Itachi tried to manipulate then with Shisui's eye. Even if the Hyuga weren't involved, if Itachi showed that he wouldn't take one of Danzo's two options, would Danzo not just Komoatsukami Itachi first?\n\nAnyways I don't think it would go so smoothly. A civil war would probably result from your scenario. You're arguing for Itachi to side with his clan and stage a coup with extra steps. Both sides would have opportunities to use Shisui's eyes. The resulting political instability and civil unrest would leave the village vulnerable to foreign enemies.",

Kishimoto obviously wanted Itachi to be the epitome of what a shinobi should be with self sacrifice but the way it was written with Itachis choices, made me dislike his methods. But Itachi had a noble heart in the end so I find it hard to believe that he would kill his entire clan while knowing that the elders were in the wrong for falsely accusing the Uchia for the 9 tails attack and allowing that rumour to spread causing many other people to doubt them. Besides the way Kishimoto portrayed the event and the dealings of Danzo and the stubbornness of the elders aswell as the way Danzo handled things it wouldn't be far fetched to say Itachi was manipulated. I said this before in one of the previous replies to someone else but if Itachi went and told Sarutobi what Danzo planned, he would have convinced Itachi to side with him and with the support of Sarutobi and the famed and influential Uchia, son of the leader Fugaku, they both could have convinced the Uchia to a peaceful outcome. If lord 3rd knew about Danzos plans than Shisui might have also survived and he would side with Itachi and Sarutobi with that many influential people the Uchia could have been persuaded to stand down...but that's IF Itachi made the right choice and told Sarutobi Hiruzen",

He had no choice in the matter. \n\n> They proved that O ly way for Uchihas to live in dignity was when Holage was an Uchiha\n\nSo they could have either: 1) Overthrown the current regime and forcibly taken power, leading to the entire rest of the village resenting them and continued the cycle of hate, subversion and violence, or 2) left and formed their own village. I just can't see how option 2 is not the right way to go. They have one of the most powerful Kekkei Genkai, they could have defended themselves, and besides, the Leaf was doing nothing to defend them as you said, so regardless founding their own village would have granted them autonomy *and* greater security.",

After the byuakugan user notices Shisui's eyes chakra at the Five Kage summit everyone knows they were manipulated by Danzo. So I don't think he could use Shisui's eye to manipulate the Hyuga. And since the Hyuga were part of the leaf that were fine with discriminating the Uchiha, I think they would go straight to Danzo/ the Third Hokage and tell them that Itachi tried to manipulate then with Shisui's eye. Even if the Hyuga weren't involved, if Itachi showed that he wouldn't take one of Danzo's two options, would Danzo not just Komoatsukami Itachi first?\n\nAnyways I don't think it would go so smoothly. A civil war would probably result from your scenario. You're arguing for Itachi to side with his clan and stage a coup with extra steps. Both sides would have opportunities to use Shisui's eyes. The resulting political instability and civil unrest would leave the village vulnerable to foreign enemies.",

It\u2019s really either you like Itachi for doing what he had to do, or dislike him for still massacring his clan. Personally, I just love him as a character and feel that his death could\u2019ve been prevented had he told Sasuke the truth beforehand. But then again, his death was something that had to happen.",

He didnt want to see another war since he was traumatized from the previous one so when the elders said \"to protect the village or the wrongful Uchia\" of course he'd believe the elders since he absolutely didn't want another war since he saw first hand the horrors of what it brought.

Kishimoto obviously wanted Itachi to be the epitome of what a shinobi should be with self sacrifice but the way it was written with Itachis choices, made me dislike his methods. But Itachi had a noble heart in the end so I find it hard to believe that he would kill his entire clan while knowing that the elders were in the wrong for falsely accusing the Uchia for the 9 tails attack and allowing that rumour to spread causing many other people to doubt them. Besides the way Kishimoto portrayed the event and the dealings of Danzo and the stubbornness of the elders aswell as the way Danzo handled things it wouldn't be far fetched to say Itachi was manipulated. I said this before in one of the previous replies to someone else but if Itachi went and told Sarutobi what Danzo planned, he would have convinced Itachi to side with him and with the support of Sarutobi and the famed and influential Uchia, son of the leader Fugaku, they both could have convinced the Uchia to a peaceful outcome. If lord 3rd knew about Danzos plans than Shisui might have also survived and he would side with Itachi and Sarutobi with that many influential people the Uchia could have been persuaded to stand down...but that's IF Itachi made the right choice and told Sarutobi Hiruzen",

I just can't see how option 2 is not the right way to go. They have one of the most powerful Kekkei Genkai, they could have defended themselves, and besides, the Leaf was doing nothing to defend them as you said, so regardless founding their own village would have granted them autonomy *and* greater security.",

After the byuakugan user notices Shisui's eyes chakra at the Five Kage summit everyone knows they were manipulated by Danzo. So I don't think he could use Shisui's eye to manipulate the Hyuga. And since the Hyuga were part of the leaf that were fine with discriminating the Uchiha, I think they would go straight to Danzo/ the Third Hokage and tell them that Itachi tried to manipulate then with Shisui's eye. Even if the Hyuga weren't involved, if Itachi showed that he wouldn't take one of Danzo's two options, would Danzo not just Komoatsukami Itachi first?\n\nAnyways I don't think it would go so smoothly. A civil war would probably result from your scenario. You're arguing for Itachi to side with his clan and stage a coup with extra steps. Both sides would have opportunities to use Shisui's eyes. The resulting political instability and civil unrest would leave the village vulnerable to foreign enemies.",

Kishimoto obviously wanted Itachi to be the epitome of what a shinobi should be with self sacrifice but the way it was written with Itachis choices, made me dislike his methods. But Itachi had a noble heart in the end so I find it hard to believe that he would kill his entire clan while knowing that the elders were in the wrong for falsely accusing the Uchia for the 9 tails attack and allowing that rumour to spread causing many other people to doubt them. Besides the way Kishimoto portrayed the event and the dealings of Danzo and the stubbornness of the elders aswell as the way Danzo handled things it wouldn't be far fetched to say Itachi was manipulated. I said this before in one of the previous replies to someone else but if Itachi went and told Sarutobi what Danzo planned, he would have convinced Itachi to side with him and with the support of Sarutobi and the famed and influential Uchia, son of the leader Fugaku, they both could have convinced the Uchia to a peaceful outcome. If lord 3rd knew about Danzos plans than Shisui might have also survived and he would side with Itachi and Sarutobi with that many influential people the Uchia could have been persuaded to stand down...but that's IF Itachi made the right choice and told Sarutobi Hiruzen",

How is a literal child supposed to come up with these plots on a very limited time scale? His entire life he was guided to believe that he could choose either the village or the clan.\n\n> He could have forced negotiations.\n\nYou said the negotiations had already failed. Danzo had one of Shisui's eyes, he would have recognized that Itachi was using the other to force negotiations and stop them, or used the Shisui eye he had to reverse either the Uchihas desire to negotiate, or to make the Leaf elite unwilling to negotiate.",

A child does not cut down his family and torture his brother for a military dictatorship. \n\nThere are multiple ways. \n\nLet me five you one scenario. \n\nItachi, after Shisui kills himself, goes to Danzo. Uses Komoatsukami on him. Danzo can't escape from it. It's completely unbreakable. Danzo, did not suspect Itachi in real story either. He believed story of suicide and was satisfied with Shisuis body never being found. \n\nThrough Danzo, Itachi has entire Root and Anbu under his direct control. Take Shisuis other eye and go to Hyuga. Use it on them and make them allied to Uchiha. \n\nGo to Fugaku, lie to him that Shisui is a traitor and that Itachi killed him. Tell him that Danzo and Hyuga are allies. \n\nGo to Third, arrange a meeting. Plan a fake attack by Danzo and Entire Root on Third. Uchihas will fight them back. Blame everything on Danzo and have him kill Third publicly. Make him a traitorous dictator. \n\nFugaku kills him. And becomes new Hokage. \nHyuga support Uchihas. Kakashi is also allied. Anbu is allied. Third has become a martyr and Uchihas are heroes. \n\nUnveil all deeds to Danzo and how he harmed Leaf and Uchiha. Publicly make Shisui a hero who saved leaf. \n\nI could think and even better Secenrio. Only a few people would die in this scenario.\n\nGet my gist. Super Genius Itachi commutes genocide when other ways were possible.",

After the byuakugan user notices Shisui's eyes chakra at the Five Kage summit everyone knows they were manipulated by Danzo. So I don't think he could use Shisui's eye to manipulate the Hyuga. And since the Hyuga were part of the leaf that were fine with discriminating the Uchiha, I think they would go straight to Danzo/ the Third Hokage and tell them that Itachi tried to manipulate then with Shisui's eye. Even if the Hyuga weren't involved, if Itachi showed that he wouldn't take one of Danzo's two options, would Danzo not just Komoatsukami Itachi first?\n\nAnyways I don't think it would go so smoothly. A civil war would probably result from your scenario. You're arguing for Itachi to side with his clan and stage a coup with extra steps. Both sides would have opportunities to use Shisui's eyes. The resulting political instability and civil unrest would leave the village vulnerable to foreign enemies.",

I dont remember them telling Itachi of how they were blaming the Uchia and segregating them without solid proof. Its understandable to want to overthrow them because it was that or live under such hate and unfairness. Sarutobi asked for more time to negotiate but the elders refused him. And with those 3 ( Danzo and the 2 other elders ) there was no way of getting a fair trial and negotiation since they outnumbered sarutobi 3 to 1 in a vote",

He didnt want to see another war since he was traumatized from the previous one so when the elders said \"to protect the village or the wrongful Uchia\" of course he'd believe the elders since he absolutely didn't want another war since he saw first hand the horrors of what it brought.

Kishimoto obviously wanted Itachi to be the epitome of what a shinobi should be with self sacrifice but the way it was written with Itachis choices, made me dislike his methods. But Itachi had a noble heart in the end so I find it hard to believe that he would kill his entire clan while knowing that the elders were in the wrong for falsely accusing the Uchia for the 9 tails attack and allowing that rumour to spread causing many other people to doubt them. Besides the way Kishimoto portrayed the event and the dealings of Danzo and the stubbornness of the elders aswell as the way Danzo handled things it wouldn't be far fetched to say Itachi was manipulated. I said this before in one of the previous replies to someone else but if Itachi went and told Sarutobi what Danzo planned, he would have convinced Itachi to side with him and with the support of Sarutobi and the famed and influential Uchia, son of the leader Fugaku, they both could have convinced the Uchia to a peaceful outcome. If lord 3rd knew about Danzos plans than Shisui might have also survived and he would side with Itachi and Sarutobi with that many influential people the Uchia could have been persuaded to stand down...but that's IF Itachi made the right choice and told Sarutobi Hiruzen",

Also I'm pretty sure a council from the Land of Fire appoints the hokages anyways. \n\nBut Itachi was 13 years old when he was told by his superiors on both sides that there were only two choices. How is a literal child supposed to come up with these plots on a very limited time scale? His entire life he was guided to believe that he could choose either the village or the clan.\n\n> He could have forced negotiations.\n\nYou said the negotiations had already failed. Danzo had one of Shisui's eyes, he would have recognized that Itachi was using the other to force negotiations and stop them, or used the Shisui eye he had to reverse either the Uchihas desire to negotiate, or to make the Leaf elite unwilling to negotiate.",

Uses Komoatsukami on him. Danzo can't escape from it. It's completely unbreakable. Danzo, did not suspect Itachi in real story either. He believed story of suicide and was satisfied with Shisuis body never being found. \n\nThrough Danzo, Itachi has entire Root and Anbu under his direct control. Take Shisuis other eye and go to Hyuga. Use it on them and make them allied to Uchiha. \n\nGo to Fugaku, lie to him that Shisui is a traitor and that Itachi killed him. Tell him that Danzo and Hyuga are allies. \n\nGo to Third, arrange a meeting. Plan a fake attack by Danzo and Entire Root on Third. Uchihas will fight them back. Blame everything on Danzo and have him kill Third publicly. Make him a traitorous dictator. \n\nFugaku kills him. And becomes new Hokage. \nHyuga support Uchihas. Kakashi is also allied. Anbu is allied. Third has become a martyr and Uchihas are heroes. \n\nUnveil all deeds to Danzo and how he harmed Leaf and Uchiha. Publicly make Shisui a hero who saved leaf. \n\nI could think and even better Secenrio. Only a few people would die in this scenario.\n\nGet my gist. Super Genius Itachi commutes genocide when other ways were possible.",

After the byuakugan user notices Shisui's eyes chakra at the Five Kage summit everyone knows they were manipulated by Danzo. So I don't think he could use Shisui's eye to manipulate the Hyuga. And since the Hyuga were part of the leaf that were fine with discriminating the Uchiha, I think they would go straight to Danzo/ the Third Hokage and tell them that Itachi tried to manipulate then with Shisui's eye. Even if the Hyuga weren't involved, if Itachi showed that he wouldn't take one of Danzo's two options, would Danzo not just Komoatsukami Itachi first?\n\nAnyways I don't think it would go so smoothly. A civil war would probably result from your scenario. You're arguing for Itachi to side with his clan and stage a coup with extra steps. Both sides would have opportunities to use Shisui's eyes. The resulting political instability and civil unrest would leave the village vulnerable to foreign enemies.",

I dont remember them telling Itachi of how they were blaming the Uchia and segregating them without solid proof. Its understandable to want to overthrow them because it was that or live under such hate and unfairness. Sarutobi asked for more time to negotiate but the elders refused him. And with those 3 ( Danzo and the 2 other elders ) there was no way of getting a fair trial and negotiation since they outnumbered sarutobi 3 to 1 in a vote",

If lord 3rd knew about Danzos plans than Shisui might have also survived and he would side with Itachi and Sarutobi with that many influential people the Uchia could have been persuaded to stand down...but that's IF Itachi made the right choice and told Sarutobi Hiruzen",

A child does not cut down his family and torture his brother for a military dictatorship. \n\nThere are multiple ways. \n\nLet me five you one scenario. \n\nItachi, after Shisui kills himself, goes to Danzo. Uses Komoatsukami on him. Danzo can't escape from it. It's completely unbreakable. Danzo, did not suspect Itachi in real story either. He believed story of suicide and was satisfied with Shisuis body never being found. \n\nThrough Danzo, Itachi has entire Root and Anbu under his direct control. Take Shisuis other eye and go to Hyuga. Use it on them and make them allied to Uchiha. \n\nGo to Fugaku, lie to him that Shisui is a traitor and that Itachi killed him. Tell him that Danzo and Hyuga are allies. \n\nGo to Third, arrange a meeting. Plan a fake attack by Danzo and Entire Root on Third. Uchihas will fight them back. Blame everything on Danzo and have him kill Third publicly. Make him a traitorous dictator. \n\nFugaku kills him. And becomes new Hokage. \nHyuga support Uchihas. Kakashi is also allied. Anbu is allied. Third has become a martyr and Uchihas are heroes. \n\nUnveil all deeds to Danzo and how he harmed Leaf and Uchiha. Publicly make Shisui a hero who saved leaf. \n\nI could think and even better Secenrio. Only a few people would die in this scenario.\n\nGet my gist. Super Genius Itachi commutes genocide when other ways were possible.",

After the byuakugan user notices Shisui's eyes chakra at the Five Kage summit everyone knows they were manipulated by Danzo. So I don't think he could use Shisui's eye to manipulate the Hyuga. And since the Hyuga were part of the leaf that were fine with discriminating the Uchiha, I think they would go straight to Danzo/ the Third Hokage and tell them that Itachi tried to manipulate then with Shisui's eye. Even if the Hyuga weren't involved, if Itachi showed that he wouldn't take one of Danzo's two options, would Danzo not just Komoatsukami Itachi first?\n\nAnyways I don't think it would go so smoothly. A civil war would probably result from your scenario. You're arguing for Itachi to side with his clan and stage a coup with extra steps. Both sides would have opportunities to use Shisui's eyes. The resulting political instability and civil unrest would leave the village vulnerable to foreign enemies.",

I said this before in one of the previous replies to someone else but if Itachi went and told Sarutobi what Danzo planned, he would have convinced Itachi to side with him and with the support of Sarutobi and the famed and influential Uchia, son of the leader Fugaku, they both could have convinced the Uchia to a peaceful outcome. If lord 3rd knew about Danzos plans than Shisui might have also survived and he would side with Itachi and Sarutobi with that many influential people the Uchia could have been persuaded to stand down...but that's IF Itachi made the right choice and told Sarutobi Hiruzen",

After the byuakugan user notices Shisui's eyes chakra at the Five Kage summit everyone knows they were manipulated by Danzo. So I don't think he could use Shisui's eye to manipulate the Hyuga. And since the Hyuga were part of the leaf that were fine with discriminating the Uchiha, I think they would go straight to Danzo/ the Third Hokage and tell them that Itachi tried to manipulate then with Shisui's eye. Even if the Hyuga weren't involved, if Itachi showed that he wouldn't take one of Danzo's two options, would Danzo not just Komoatsukami Itachi first?\n\nAnyways I don't think it would go so smoothly. A civil war would probably result from your scenario. You're arguing for Itachi to side with his clan and stage a coup with extra steps. Both sides would have opportunities to use Shisui's eyes. The resulting political instability and civil unrest would leave the village vulnerable to foreign enemies.",

He didnt want to see another war since he was traumatized from the previous one so when the elders said \"to protect the village or the wrongful Uchia\" of course he'd believe the elders since he absolutely didn't want another war since he saw first hand the horrors of what it brought.

            "body": "I know that's my point in this comment section, I dislike the way Itachi was written. Kishimoto obviously wanted Itachi to be the epitome of what a shinobi should be with self sacrifice but the way it was written with Itachis choices, made me dislike his methods. But Itachi had a noble heart in the end so I find it hard to believe that he would kill his entire clan while knowing that the elders were in the wrong for falsely accusing the Uchia for the 9 tails attack and allowing that rumour to spread causing many other people to doubt them. Besides the way Kishimoto portrayed the event and the dealings of Danzo and the stubbornness of the elders aswell as the way Danzo handled things it wouldn't be far fetched to say Itachi was manipulated. I said this before in one of the previous replies to someone else but if Itachi went and told Sarutobi what Danzo planned, he would have convinced Itachi to side with him and with the support of Sarutobi and the famed and influential Uchia, son of the leader Fugaku, they both could have convinced the Uchia to a peaceful outcome. If lord 3rd knew about Danzos plans than Shisui might have also survived and he would side with Itachi and Sarutobi with that many influential people the Uchia could have been persuaded to stand down...but that's IF Itachi made the right choice and told Sarutobi Hiruzen",
