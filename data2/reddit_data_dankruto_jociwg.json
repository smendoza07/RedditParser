They can't use Kakashi vs Obito style ( Naoki Kobayashi ) animation because floaty animation is considered bad animation and a finale to a big franchise, eagerly awaited and watched by animators all over the world can't have floaty animation.",

I\u2019m sure some important stuff happened but let\u2019s be honest everyone was waiting for the time skip. On the other hand, I thought that Shippuden had more great arcs than OG, but the  crappy filler and slow pacing meant it didn\u2019t really have the momentum of OG Naruto. The fights were definitely more technical in OG, but it\u2019s not like Shippuden\u2019s fights were that bad. I thought that the Akutsuki fights were all excellent for the most part (with a couple exceptions). I really appreciate both part 1 and Shippuden as u r invested in the growth of the characters. I just wish Shippuden had Naruto becoming Hokage as the ending. I really liked the wedding arc, but come on the entire point is that it\u2019s the outcast who became Hokage. All we have now is the gag that Boruto gave us. I don\u2019t hate too much on Boruto, but come on I wanted to see our boy become Hokage",

            "body": "The first Naruto vs Sasuke used exciting kinetic animation while the second used well drawn and on-model art, different approaches to animation, while the second approach is the industry norm while the first is director giving Norio Matsumoto freedom to flex.\n\nChoreography and story-boarding was way better in the second one, it was a slower tempo because they were trying to highlight Sasuke not allowing Naruto to weave the hand sign for shadow clone jutsu ( shadow clone representing Naruto's way to cope with loneliness) and the second fight had a very stacked staff compared to just Norio Matsumoto and Atsushi wakabayashi dominated first one. They can't use Kakashi vs Obito style ( Naoki Kobayashi ) animation because floaty animation is considered bad animation and a finale to a big franchise, eagerly awaited and watched by animators all over the world can't have floaty animation.",
