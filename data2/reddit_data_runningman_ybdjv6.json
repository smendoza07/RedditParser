He's an international superstar, he's not going to flirt with anyone on-screen (and he's really really shy tbh) I've seen every episode of Running Man, and I know Somin, and I also know everyone on the show has been warned to act accordingly. I'm an army, I know how things go in our fandom. Somin isn't stupid, she's not going to do anything weird for the sake of entertainment in front of one of the most famous guy on earth at the moment. And thw whole world will be watching. And I know Jin, even though he's easy going and the nicest guy ever, he won't tolerate any moves made towards him. Be it flirty, rude or anything uncomfortable he's going to shut you down. But he doesn't need to do any of that. Somin will be a really nice noona to Jin. I'm sure of it. The episode is gonna be cool. \ud83d\ude04 I do hope the ratings go up, and a lot of armys become fans, I'm always worried that the show is going to be cancelled anytime. Especially when Kwangsoo left.",

I'm an army, I know how things go in our fandom. Somin isn't stupid, she's not going to do anything weird for the sake of entertainment in front of one of the most famous guy on earth at the moment. And thw whole world will be watching. And I know Jin, even though he's easy going and the nicest guy ever, he won't tolerate any moves made towards him. Be it flirty, rude or anything uncomfortable he's going to shut you down. But he doesn't need to do any of that. Somin will be a really nice noona to Jin. I'm sure of it.

He's an international superstar, he's not going to flirt with anyone on-screen (and he's really really shy tbh) I've seen every episode of Running Man, and I know Somin, and I also know everyone on the show has been warned to act accordingly. I'm an army, I know how things go in our fandom. Somin isn't stupid, she's not going to do anything weird for the sake of entertainment in front of one of the most famous guy on earth at the moment. And thw whole world will be watching. And I know Jin, even though he's easy going and the nicest guy ever, he won't tolerate any moves made towards him. Be it flirty, rude or anything uncomfortable he's going to shut you down. But he doesn't need to do any of that. Somin will be a really nice noona to Jin. I'm sure of it. The episode is gonna be cool. \ud83d\ude04 I do hope the ratings go up, and a lot of armys become fans, I'm always worried that the show is going to be cancelled anytime.
