And Naruto did notice Hinata, Iruka took naruto out for ramen even before he became a ninja there was a whole flash-back-that-we-didn't-see ep. about it, but you were a little right about Jiraiya and Shicamaru, but they where there and respected him, just in late eps. but they did respect him non the less.\nIt's not about who noticed him first it's about who notices him at all. So you are completly wrong, but the only true thing you said was that Teuchi should be on the list",

But no becuase that post was right, Saskue was with team 7 for at least a year where he noticed Naruto for about 3 maybe 5 ep. including filler eps. And Naruto did notice Hinata, Iruka took naruto out for ramen even before he became a ninja there was a whole flash-back-that-we-didn't-see ep. about it, but you were a little right about Jiraiya and Shicamaru, but they where there and respected him, just in late eps. but they did respect him non the less.\nIt's not about who noticed him first it's about who notices him at all. So you are completly wrong, but the only true thing you said was that Teuchi should be on the list",
