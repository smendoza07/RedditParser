Goku proves that it possible to rise above it, but that was even the case when Planet Vegeta was still in existence. Ranking up just wasn't common. And Bardock is a prime example. Despite being among the strongest low class he never became strong enough to become mid-class. If he had reached that strength he would've ranked up.\n\nAnd we can even see that reflected in Raditz who thought nothing of his lower ranked family. Despite his background as coming from a low class family he was still assigned as an upper level combatant on the same squad as Nappa, which Vegeta was later brought onto. If the system were purely political he would've been lower ranked like his family and his strength ignored. \n\nThings do get muddled when you consider the TV special where Bardock is ridiculously strong but still low ranked. However the special isn't canon and canon Bardock isn't nearly that strong (evidenced by the prior statement of Bardock not being mid coming from Toriyama's response to how strong the non canon specials made him).\n\nBut in short its pretty direct. You get stronger, you rank up.",

But Naruto has more. \nBut the writing is \ud83d\udcaf In the CA arc, there\u2019s a lot of symbolism in that arc and the point i see togashi tryna make is what makes it my favorite. Naruto is a close second though. But to be fair with HxH you really gotta pay attention though I\u2019d say with the CA arc it is not something you can just casually watch. Not to sound like an elitist lol\nJust my view on them\nYou didn\u2019t like the Phantom troupe scene massacring everyone and Chrollo orchestrating it? Idk I\u2019d take that over most scenes in Naruto, definitely not all, but that was dope asf",

Probably because he had no plan when he originally started writing Naruto and then with every new Character he introduced, he had his little flowchart to decide whether he likes the character or not.\n\nNaruto is hated at the start by the entire Village? The first Hokage defeated the Bijuu and split them across the Nations (except the 1 Tail I think?) - his Wife was a Holder and her Descendants ever since. You are trying to tell me that no one knew about them but they all HAD to know about Naruto? He was the Son of their beloved 4th Hokage but cannot be bothered with that shit.\nAdditionally we had the sad scene of Kushinas and Minatos death were the third Hokage promised to take care of Naruto.\nWell good shit that we saw nothing of that ever. The only interaction we saw between the Third and Naruto early on was some slight grandfather and grandson behavior, really lackluster shit.\nAnd why? Because Naruto could not be treated properly from the get go.\nWhy else would literally everyone know about the Monster inside of him but not that he is the son of the fourth - save for a few people.\n\nHe just made shit up as he went along and you just knew that it was done in hindsight.\n\nItachi? The golden child? His beloved baby boy?\nHe did everything in his power to twist him into the dashing anti-hero \u201efine, I\u2019ll do it myself and take on this giant responsibility and hatred\u201c agent of badassery.\n\nCan\u2019t bullshit me saying that he had it planned from the get-go. Otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have behaved the way he did in early Naruto and the way he treated Sasuke.\n\nBut maybe I am just too stupid because apparently Itachi had 5 million IQ and could do nothing wrong.\nThen he also had to give Itachi a major sickness so that Sasukes win over him feels not really earned and gifted + ridding him of Orochimaru.\n\nThe amount of plotholes, weird story telling, dashing from good to bad to good just for the sake of \u201efixing\u201c the character is mind boggling.\n\n\nAlso was it ever explained why Naruto gets his Super Saiyan Power Boost from performing a transformation but all the other more trained Jinchuriki go apeshit into the full tailed beast?\nCuz if it was the split chakra halves - man Kishimoto did those guys dirty. If it wasn\u2019t, hell fucking ouch.\nAlso giving Kakashi double MS and having him immediately master Susanoo and spamming Kamui was a giant \u201efuck you\u201c to Itachi and Sasuke.\n\nSo many points were he went for badassery over sense.\n\nStill love the anime, just able to see the flaws",

Hell, everything from character designs to female character relevance, to plot, and to comedy was handled better in Hakusho hell even the main character is far better than hunter x hunters Gon is just a generic never give up shonen protagonist who is \"in tune with nature\" While Yusuke starts off as a bad person and maintains his stand offish attitude throughout the show even after enduring trials and tribulations of dying in the first episode. Which is really refreshing. he does not just suddenly change and become a generic protagonist he genuinely grows as a person as the show goes on. in closing hunter x hunter is okay but I do not feel it should be considered one of the best shonen of all time especially not when compared to what came before it, and I will die on this hill.",

The fights are cool, the world building is cool, the mechanics are cool but the characters are mostly bland. We don't get any impactful stuff like Zuko's redemption from ATLA. It's mostly just a matter of introducing some dude, giving him a couple of fights and killing him/letting him win. They just don't give anyone enough depth.",

Some people might not like the art style or story in general. The general rule of thump with this is, try completing a single arc or at minimum first 10 episodes and decide if you wanna continue cause trust me if you are like me and loved it at first, you will love it throughout its thousand episodes .\n\nEdit - fk even its filler is some of the godly fillers I have seen in anime",

Jojo villains in the first five parts are pretty much sociopaths who do evil things just because. There's nothing wrong with that per se, but they hold back the story from being a lot better. Araki himself realized this, which is exactly how he came up with Pucci and retconned Dio in part six to be more sympathetic villains with reasonable goals, resembling more the great Naruto villains such as Pain or Madara. Then he came up with even greater villains such as Valentine or Diego, and added more complexity by blurring the morality of the heroes Johnny and Gyro (which Naruto could have done and benefit a lot from, which it didn't) and these are easily the reasons Steel Ball Run is held in such a high regard.\n\nIt just shows that there is always room for improvement like in Jojo's. Or room to get worse like Naruto did with Kaguya.",

Not to say Kishimoto can't swing it out of the park sometimes (Rest in peace Asuma), but other times it feels like the mood is all over the place, or barely touches the surface of moral philosophy.\n\nAnd I think that's why I prefer DBZ, it just had a more consistent simple atmosphere to it. Glad naruto attempted to be more than a brainless shonen manga, but I feel like it hurt itself in the process, and just came across as an awkward fanfic. And at that point I'd rather watch HunterxHunter for that type of story content lol\n\nSeriously though, read the opening chapters of part 1, I really think Naruto singlehandedly inspired every edgy self insert fanfic to come from kids and teenagers at the time lmao",

Because it doesn't feel like Naruto _itself_ believes its philosophies are simple.\n\nAt some point in Part 2 and onward, the words coming out of characters mouths feel like they belong in some flowery, highly abstract poetry. The themes about vengeance, trust, friendship, the cycle of pain, and the nature of a Hokage, felt botched to me due to the choice of dialogue.\n\nReally though, I only started feeling this way some time during or after the Pain arc, where Naruto and Sakura were faced with the moral dilemma of treating their best friend as a person to be saved, or as a criminal. Or Sasuke's point of view with Itachi/what it means to be a Hokage. Or literally everything to do with how Obito's character was handled. Or every attempt to make the villains look redeemable, manipulated by some _greater_ entity, only to end with a 2 dimensional, mustache twirling villain anyways in the form of Kaguya/Black Zetsu.\n\nAnd yeah, most if not all of Dragon Ball/Z's villains are mustache twirling bad guys too, but it feels more self aware of that thanks to its more comedic nature. To me it felt like it generally had better direction just for taking itself less seriously (Especially Pre-Z) than Naruto does.\n\nBut at the end of the day, I guess that's just my opinion lol",

I really like the whole video game vibe from it, the cards are an extremely interesting driver of the plot, and you meet so many cool characters like razor and bisky, you get introduced to one of killua coolest fighting scenes when he does that sick ass stance with the yo-yos and mops the dude, and although the bomber is kinda a weak villain and very obviously based off yoshikage kira, you get to see one of the first points in the show where we truly see how insane gon is and his dedication to getting stronger and completing a plan. I really think greed island is criminally underrated because it\u2019s placed between two of the greatest anime arcs of all time in chimera ant and yorknew city.",

The action is mostly lackluster and sparse, which fucks me up knowing Madhouse adapted it.

Also the strongest hunter fighting the strongest monster is mostly just blurry punching and jumping around. Was quite the let down considering the hype and amount of episodes.\n\nAs far as shonen action goes (maybe even story overall)? Naruto over HxH any day of the week.",

Goku proves that it possible to rise above it, but that was even the case when Planet Vegeta was still in existence. Ranking up just wasn't common. And Bardock is a prime example. Despite being among the strongest low class he never became strong enough to become mid-class. If he had reached that strength he would've ranked up.\n\nAnd we can even see that reflected in Raditz who thought nothing of his lower ranked family. Despite his background as coming from a low class family he was still assigned as an upper level combatant on the same squad as Nappa, which Vegeta was later brought onto. If the system were purely political he would've been lower ranked like his family and his strength ignored. \n\nThings do get muddled when you consider the TV special where Bardock is ridiculously strong but still low ranked. However the special isn't canon and canon Bardock isn't nearly that strong (evidenced by the prior statement of Bardock not being mid coming from Toriyama's response to how strong the non canon specials made him).\n\nBut in short its pretty direct. You get stronger, you rank up.",

It basically shows what happens when Okabe gives up on saving Kurisu, how the world evolves without her, how Okabe copes with the trauma of constant and ultimate failure to save both of the people he loves most, and ultimately how Okabe does end up saving Kurisu (and the world) at the end of the original series!<.\n\nYes, it can be slow sometimes. And it is awfully depressing as someone before me mentioned, but I believe that is completely appropriate given the context.

On top of that, the world is very much literally coming to an end and one could argue it is entirely his fault, Suzuha seems to believe that at least and loves to remind him. He also has to deal with the betrayal of someone he looked up to and respected.\n\nIt is no exaggeration that Okabe is carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders.\n\nAlso going to respectfully disagree with your assertion that it adds nothing worthwhile to the plot or characters.

Steins;Gate 0 illustrates the suffering and sacrifice from characters required to make that happy ending happen.

Probably because he had no plan when he originally started writing Naruto and then with every new Character he introduced, he had his little flowchart to decide whether he likes the character or not.\n\nNaruto is hated at the start by the entire Village? The first Hokage defeated the Bijuu and split them across the Nations (except the 1 Tail I think?) - his Wife was a Holder and her Descendants ever since. You are trying to tell me that no one knew about them but they all HAD to know about Naruto? He was the Son of their beloved 4th Hokage but cannot be bothered with that shit.\nAdditionally we had the sad scene of Kushinas and Minatos death were the third Hokage promised to take care of Naruto.\nWell good shit that we saw nothing of that ever. The only interaction we saw between the Third and Naruto early on was some slight grandfather and grandson behavior, really lackluster shit.\nAnd why? Because Naruto could not be treated properly from the get go.\nWhy else would literally everyone know about the Monster inside of him but not that he is the son of the fourth - save for a few people.\n\nHe just made shit up as he went along and you just knew that it was done in hindsight.\n\nItachi? The golden child? His beloved baby boy?\nHe did everything in his power to twist him into the dashing anti-hero \u201efine, I\u2019ll do it myself and take on this giant responsibility and hatred\u201c agent of badassery.\n\nCan\u2019t bullshit me saying that he had it planned from the get-go. Otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have behaved the way he did in early Naruto and the way he treated Sasuke.\n\nBut maybe I am just too stupid because apparently Itachi had 5 million IQ and could do nothing wrong.\nThen he also had to give Itachi a major sickness so that Sasukes win over him feels not really earned and gifted + ridding him of Orochimaru.\n\nThe amount of plotholes, weird story telling, dashing from good to bad to good just for the sake of \u201efixing\u201c the character is mind boggling.\n\n\nAlso was it ever explained why Naruto gets his Super Saiyan Power Boost from performing a transformation but all the other more trained Jinchuriki go apeshit into the full tailed beast?\nCuz if it was the split chakra halves - man Kishimoto did those guys dirty. If it wasn\u2019t, hell fucking ouch.\nAlso giving Kakashi double MS and having him immediately master Susanoo and spamming Kamui was a giant \u201efuck you\u201c to Itachi and Sasuke.\n\nSo many points were he went for badassery over sense.\n\nStill love the anime, just able to see the flaws",

Jojo villains in the first five parts are pretty much sociopaths who do evil things just because. There's nothing wrong with that per se, but they hold back the story from being a lot better. Araki himself realized this, which is exactly how he came up with Pucci and retconned Dio in part six to be more sympathetic villains with reasonable goals, resembling more the great Naruto villains such as Pain or Madara. Then he came up with even greater villains such as Valentine or Diego, and added more complexity by blurring the morality of the heroes Johnny and Gyro (which Naruto could have done and benefit a lot from, which it didn't) and these are easily the reasons Steel Ball Run is held in such a high regard.\n\nIt just shows that there is always room for improvement like in Jojo's. Or room to get worse like Naruto did with Kaguya.",

Whereas I'm sorry to say but DBZ had no philosophy at all, no moral of the story or whatever. Its just villains being villains for the sake of the plot needing villains. MC trains while side characters wait in a line from weakest to strongest to fight the villain, Goku comes last to defeat villain and that's it. OG DB is much better of a story tbh",

Because it doesn't feel like Naruto _itself_ believes its philosophies are simple.\n\nAt some point in Part 2 and onward, the words coming out of characters mouths feel like they belong in some flowery, highly abstract poetry. The themes about vengeance, trust, friendship, the cycle of pain, and the nature of a Hokage, felt botched to me due to the choice of dialogue.\n\nReally though, I only started feeling this way some time during or after the Pain arc, where Naruto and Sakura were faced with the moral dilemma of treating their best friend as a person to be saved, or as a criminal. Or Sasuke's point of view with Itachi/what it means to be a Hokage. Or literally everything to do with how Obito's character was handled. Or every attempt to make the villains look redeemable, manipulated by some _greater_ entity, only to end with a 2 dimensional, mustache twirling villain anyways in the form of Kaguya/Black Zetsu.\n\nAnd yeah, most if not all of Dragon Ball/Z's villains are mustache twirling bad guys too, but it feels more self aware of that thanks to its more comedic nature. To me it felt like it generally had better direction just for taking itself less seriously (Especially Pre-Z) than Naruto does.\n\nBut at the end of the day, I guess that's just my opinion lol",

I really like the whole video game vibe from it, the cards are an extremely interesting driver of the plot, and you meet so many cool characters like razor and bisky, you get introduced to one of killua coolest fighting scenes when he does that sick ass stance with the yo-yos and mops the dude, and although the bomber is kinda a weak villain and very obviously based off yoshikage kira, you get to see one of the first points in the show where we truly see how insane gon is and his dedication to getting stronger and completing a plan. I really think greed island is criminally underrated because it\u2019s placed between two of the greatest anime arcs of all time in chimera ant and yorknew city.",

Goku proves that it possible to rise above it, but that was even the case when Planet Vegeta was still in existence. Ranking up just wasn't common. And Bardock is a prime example. Despite being among the strongest low class he never became strong enough to become mid-class. If he had reached that strength he would've ranked up.\n\nAnd we can even see that reflected in Raditz who thought nothing of his lower ranked family. Despite his background as coming from a low class family he was still assigned as an upper level combatant on the same squad as Nappa, which Vegeta was later brought onto. If the system were purely political he would've been lower ranked like his family and his strength ignored. \n\nThings do get muddled when you consider the TV special where Bardock is ridiculously strong but still low ranked. However the special isn't canon and canon Bardock isn't nearly that strong (evidenced by the prior statement of Bardock not being mid coming from Toriyama's response to how strong the non canon specials made him).\n\nBut in short its pretty direct. You get stronger, you rank up.",

Naruto is a close second though. But to be fair with HxH you really gotta pay attention though I\u2019d say with the CA arc it is not something you can just casually watch. Not to sound like an elitist lol\nJust my view on them\nYou didn\u2019t like the Phantom troupe scene massacring everyone and Chrollo orchestrating it? Idk I\u2019d take that over most scenes in Naruto, definitely not all, but that was dope asf",

And it\u2019s really not that long. If you do watch it look at the subtle things, the metaphors, symbolism, I\u2019m normally not that guy, but once you get what the author is tryna say it makes it better.\nTo me it\u2019s like watching Breaking bad or the sopranos, there isn\u2019t something going on all the time on a surface level, but there is something going on all the time. Get what I\u2019m saying? Lol\nAnd shit if you gonna rewatch the phantom troupe arc do it drunk or high bruh idk why but I did that and shit was crazy\ud83d\ude02",

And it is awfully depressing as someone before me mentioned, but I believe that is completely appropriate given the context.

He has seen his best friend Mayuri die countless times, as well as the love of his life Kurisu. Not only does he have to cope with the fact that he could not save Kurisu, he has to deal with the memories of him murdering her *himself*. On top of that, the world is very much literally coming to an end and one could argue it is entirely his fault, Suzuha seems to believe that at least and loves to remind him. He also has to deal with the betrayal of someone he looked up to and respected.\n\nIt is no exaggeration that Okabe is carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders.\n\nAlso going to respectfully disagree with your assertion that it adds nothing worthwhile to the plot or characters. View my previous comment if you want further details.\n\nSteins;Gate has a nice, pleasant, happy ending. This is true. Steins;Gate 0 illustrates the suffering and sacrifice from characters required to make that happy ending happen. Steins;Gate 0 is allowed to be as sad as it wants because viewers already *know* that there is a happy ending waiting.",

Probably because he had no plan when he originally started writing Naruto and then with every new Character he introduced, he had his little flowchart to decide whether he likes the character or not.\n\nNaruto is hated at the start by the entire Village? The first Hokage defeated the Bijuu and split them across the Nations (except the 1 Tail I think?) - his Wife was a Holder and her Descendants ever since. You are trying to tell me that no one knew about them but they all HAD to know about Naruto? He was the Son of their beloved 4th Hokage but cannot be bothered with that shit.\nAdditionally we had the sad scene of Kushinas and Minatos death were the third Hokage promised to take care of Naruto.\nWell good shit that we saw nothing of that ever. The only interaction we saw between the Third and Naruto early on was some slight grandfather and grandson behavior, really lackluster shit.\nAnd why? Because Naruto could not be treated properly from the get go.\nWhy else would literally everyone know about the Monster inside of him but not that he is the son of the fourth - save for a few people.\n\nHe just made shit up as he went along and you just knew that it was done in hindsight.\n\nItachi? The golden child? His beloved baby boy?\nHe did everything in his power to twist him into the dashing anti-hero \u201efine, I\u2019ll do it myself and take on this giant responsibility and hatred\u201c agent of badassery.\n\nCan\u2019t bullshit me saying that he had it planned from the get-go. Otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have behaved the way he did in early Naruto and the way he treated Sasuke.\n\nBut maybe I am just too stupid because apparently Itachi had 5 million IQ and could do nothing wrong.\nThen he also had to give Itachi a major sickness so that Sasukes win over him feels not really earned and gifted + ridding him of Orochimaru.\n\nThe amount of plotholes, weird story telling, dashing from good to bad to good just for the sake of \u201efixing\u201c the character is mind boggling.\n\n\nAlso was it ever explained why Naruto gets his Super Saiyan Power Boost from performing a transformation but all the other more trained Jinchuriki go apeshit into the full tailed beast?\nCuz if it was the split chakra halves - man Kishimoto did those guys dirty. If it wasn\u2019t, hell fucking ouch.\nAlso giving Kakashi double MS and having him immediately master Susanoo and spamming Kamui was a giant \u201efuck you\u201c to Itachi and Sasuke.\n\nSo many points were he went for badassery over sense.\n\nStill love the anime, just able to see the flaws",

Jojo villains in the first five parts are pretty much sociopaths who do evil things just because. There's nothing wrong with that per se, but they hold back the story from being a lot better. Araki himself realized this, which is exactly how he came up with Pucci and retconned Dio in part six to be more sympathetic villains with reasonable goals, resembling more the great Naruto villains such as Pain or Madara. Then he came up with even greater villains such as Valentine or Diego, and added more complexity by blurring the morality of the heroes Johnny and Gyro (which Naruto could have done and benefit a lot from, which it didn't) and these are easily the reasons Steel Ball Run is held in such a high regard.\n\nIt just shows that there is always room for improvement like in Jojo's. Or room to get worse like Naruto did with Kaguya.",

Because it doesn't feel like Naruto _itself_ believes its philosophies are simple.\n\nAt some point in Part 2 and onward, the words coming out of characters mouths feel like they belong in some flowery, highly abstract poetry. The themes about vengeance, trust, friendship, the cycle of pain, and the nature of a Hokage, felt botched to me due to the choice of dialogue.\n\nReally though, I only started feeling this way some time during or after the Pain arc, where Naruto and Sakura were faced with the moral dilemma of treating their best friend as a person to be saved, or as a criminal. Or Sasuke's point of view with Itachi/what it means to be a Hokage. Or literally everything to do with how Obito's character was handled. Or every attempt to make the villains look redeemable, manipulated by some _greater_ entity, only to end with a 2 dimensional, mustache twirling villain anyways in the form of Kaguya/Black Zetsu.\n\nAnd yeah, most if not all of Dragon Ball/Z's villains are mustache twirling bad guys too, but it feels more self aware of that thanks to its more comedic nature. To me it felt like it generally had better direction just for taking itself less seriously (Especially Pre-Z) than Naruto does.\n\nBut at the end of the day, I guess that's just my opinion lol",

I really like the whole video game vibe from it, the cards are an extremely interesting driver of the plot, and you meet so many cool characters like razor and bisky, you get introduced to one of killua coolest fighting scenes when he does that sick ass stance with the yo-yos and mops the dude, and although the bomber is kinda a weak villain and very obviously based off yoshikage kira, you get to see one of the first points in the show where we truly see how insane gon is and his dedication to getting stronger and completing a plan. I really think greed island is criminally underrated because it\u2019s placed between two of the greatest anime arcs of all time in chimera ant and yorknew city.",

Also the strongest hunter fighting the strongest monster is mostly just blurry punching and jumping around.

Goku proves that it possible to rise above it, but that was even the case when Planet Vegeta was still in existence. Ranking up just wasn't common. And Bardock is a prime example. Despite being among the strongest low class he never became strong enough to become mid-class. If he had reached that strength he would've ranked up.\n\nAnd we can even see that reflected in Raditz who thought nothing of his lower ranked family. Despite his background as coming from a low class family he was still assigned as an upper level combatant on the same squad as Nappa, which Vegeta was later brought onto. If the system were purely political he would've been lower ranked like his family and his strength ignored. \n\nThings do get muddled when you consider the TV special where Bardock is ridiculously strong but still low ranked. However the special isn't canon and canon Bardock isn't nearly that strong (evidenced by the prior statement of Bardock not being mid coming from Toriyama's response to how strong the non canon specials made him).\n\nBut in short its pretty direct. You get stronger, you rank up.",

The peak of that arc is better than what I\u2019ve seen in Naruto. But Naruto has more. \nBut the writing is \ud83d\udcaf In the CA arc, there\u2019s a lot of symbolism in that arc and the point i see togashi tryna make is what makes it my favorite. Naruto is a close second though. But to be fair with HxH you really gotta pay attention though I\u2019d say with the CA arc it is not something you can just casually watch. Not to sound like an elitist lol\nJust my view on them\nYou didn\u2019t like the Phantom troupe scene massacring everyone and Chrollo orchestrating it? Idk I\u2019d take that over most scenes in Naruto, definitely not all, but that was dope asf",

It basically shows what happens when Okabe gives up on saving Kurisu, how the world evolves without her, how Okabe copes with the trauma of constant and ultimate failure to save both of the people he loves most, and ultimately how Okabe does end up saving Kurisu (and the world) at the end of the original series!<.\n\nYes, it can be slow sometimes.

On top of that, the world is very much literally coming to an end and one could argue it is entirely his fault, Suzuha seems to believe that at least and loves to remind him. He also has to deal with the betrayal of someone he looked up to and respected.\n\nIt is no exaggeration that Okabe is carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders.\n\nAlso going to respectfully disagree with your assertion that it adds nothing worthwhile to the plot or characters.

Steins;Gate 0 illustrates the suffering and sacrifice from characters required to make that happy ending happen.

Also the strongest hunter fighting the strongest monster is mostly just blurry punching and jumping around.

Goku proves that it possible to rise above it, but that was even the case when Planet Vegeta was still in existence. Ranking up just wasn't common. And Bardock is a prime example. Despite being among the strongest low class he never became strong enough to become mid-class. If he had reached that strength he would've ranked up.\n\nAnd we can even see that reflected in Raditz who thought nothing of his lower ranked family. Despite his background as coming from a low class family he was still assigned as an upper level combatant on the same squad as Nappa, which Vegeta was later brought onto. If the system were purely political he would've been lower ranked like his family and his strength ignored. \n\nThings do get muddled when you consider the TV special where Bardock is ridiculously strong but still low ranked. However the special isn't canon and canon Bardock isn't nearly that strong (evidenced by the prior statement of Bardock not being mid coming from Toriyama's response to how strong the non canon specials made him).\n\nBut in short its pretty direct. You get stronger, you rank up.",

Naruto is a close second though. But to be fair with HxH you really gotta pay attention though I\u2019d say with the CA arc it is not something you can just casually watch. Not to sound like an elitist lol\nJust my view on them\nYou didn\u2019t like the Phantom troupe scene massacring everyone and Chrollo orchestrating it?

It basically shows what happens when Okabe gives up on saving Kurisu, how the world evolves without her, how Okabe copes with the trauma of constant and ultimate failure to save both of the people he loves most, and ultimately how Okabe does end up saving Kurisu (and the world) at the end of the original series!<.\n\nYes, it can be slow sometimes.

He has seen his best friend Mayuri die countless times, as well as the love of his life Kurisu. Not only does he have to cope with the fact that he could not save Kurisu, he has to deal with the memories of him murdering her *himself*. On top of that, the world is very much literally coming to an end and one could argue it is entirely his fault, Suzuha seems to believe that at least and loves to remind him. He also has to deal with the betrayal of someone he looked up to and respected.\n\nIt is no exaggeration that Okabe is carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders.\n\nAlso going to respectfully disagree with your assertion that it adds nothing worthwhile to the plot or characters. View my previous comment if you want further details.\n\nSteins;Gate has a nice, pleasant, happy ending. This is true. Steins;Gate 0 illustrates the suffering and sacrifice from characters required to make that happy ending happen. Steins;Gate 0 is allowed to be as sad as it wants because viewers already *know* that there is a happy ending waiting.",

Some people might not like the art style or story in general. The general rule of thump with this is, try completing a single arc or at minimum first 10 episodes and decide if you wanna continue cause trust me if you are like me and loved it at first, you will love it throughout its thousand episodes .\n\nEdit - fk even its filler is some of the godly fillers I have seen in anime",

Goku proves that it possible to rise above it, but that was even the case when Planet Vegeta was still in existence. Ranking up just wasn't common. And Bardock is a prime example. Despite being among the strongest low class he never became strong enough to become mid-class. If he had reached that strength he would've ranked up.\n\nAnd we can even see that reflected in Raditz who thought nothing of his lower ranked family. Despite his background as coming from a low class family he was still assigned as an upper level combatant on the same squad as Nappa, which Vegeta was later brought onto. If the system were purely political he would've been lower ranked like his family and his strength ignored. \n\nThings do get muddled when you consider the TV special where Bardock is ridiculously strong but still low ranked. However the special isn't canon and canon Bardock isn't nearly that strong (evidenced by the prior statement of Bardock not being mid coming from Toriyama's response to how strong the non canon specials made him).\n\nBut in short its pretty direct. You get stronger, you rank up.",

He has seen his best friend Mayuri die countless times, as well as the love of his life Kurisu. Not only does he have to cope with the fact that he could not save Kurisu, he has to deal with the memories of him murdering her *himself*. On top of that, the world is very much literally coming to an end and one could argue it is entirely his fault, Suzuha seems to believe that at least and loves to remind him. He also has to deal with the betrayal of someone he looked up to and respected.\n\nIt is no exaggeration that Okabe is carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders.\n\nAlso going to respectfully disagree with your assertion that it adds nothing worthwhile to the plot or characters. View my previous comment if you want further details.\n\nSteins;Gate has a nice, pleasant, happy ending. This is true. Steins;Gate 0 illustrates the suffering and sacrifice from characters required to make that happy ending happen. Steins;Gate 0 is allowed to be as sad as it wants because viewers already *know* that there is a happy ending waiting.",

Goku proves that it possible to rise above it, but that was even the case when Planet Vegeta was still in existence. Ranking up just wasn't common. And Bardock is a prime example. Despite being among the strongest low class he never became strong enough to become mid-class. If he had reached that strength he would've ranked up.\n\nAnd we can even see that reflected in Raditz who thought nothing of his lower ranked family. Despite his background as coming from a low class family he was still assigned as an upper level combatant on the same squad as Nappa, which Vegeta was later brought onto. If the system were purely political he would've been lower ranked like his family and his strength ignored. \n\nThings do get muddled when you consider the TV special where Bardock is ridiculously strong but still low ranked. However the special isn't canon and canon Bardock isn't nearly that strong (evidenced by the prior statement of Bardock not being mid coming from Toriyama's response to how strong the non canon specials made him).\n\nBut in short its pretty direct. You get stronger, you rank up.",

The peak of that arc is better than what I\u2019ve seen in Naruto. But Naruto has more. \nBut the writing is \ud83d\udcaf In the CA arc, there\u2019s a lot of symbolism in that arc and the point i see togashi tryna make is what makes it my favorite. Naruto is a close second though. But to be fair with HxH you really gotta pay attention though I\u2019d say with the CA arc it is not something you can just casually watch. Not to sound like an elitist lol\nJust my view on them\nYou didn\u2019t like the Phantom troupe scene massacring everyone and Chrollo orchestrating it? Idk I\u2019d take that over most scenes in Naruto, definitely not all, but that was dope asf",

Goku proves that it possible to rise above it, but that was even the case when Planet Vegeta was still in existence. Ranking up just wasn't common. And Bardock is a prime example. Despite being among the strongest low class he never became strong enough to become mid-class. If he had reached that strength he would've ranked up.\n\nAnd we can even see that reflected in Raditz who thought nothing of his lower ranked family. Despite his background as coming from a low class family he was still assigned as an upper level combatant on the same squad as Nappa, which Vegeta was later brought onto. If the system were purely political he would've been lower ranked like his family and his strength ignored. \n\nThings do get muddled when you consider the TV special where Bardock is ridiculously strong but still low ranked. However the special isn't canon and canon Bardock isn't nearly that strong (evidenced by the prior statement of Bardock not being mid coming from Toriyama's response to how strong the non canon specials made him).\n\nBut in short its pretty direct. You get stronger, you rank up.",
