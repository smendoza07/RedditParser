Lucky lady! \n\nMy SD got me a waterproof speaker from Bang Olufsen (he knows I\u2019ll be heading to the slopes this Christmas) in my favorite color and I got him a song book of his favorite guitar music that we\u2019ve listened to and talked about endlessly.. The most meaningful part is that in our country, Christmas isn\u2019t a big deal so it meant a lot that he got me a gift.\n\nEdit* he plays guitar!",

So it either has to be something unexpected (the songbook below was excellent) that we discussed during our time together or something you make.  if you have been taking photos of the things you've done over the past year, make a scrapbook, or if he needs privacy make a private website with the pictures, that only the two of you have the password for.  Even if you have few photos, use online remembrances (th emend from your favorite restaurant he has taken you to).  Baking his favorite cookies or cake decorated for Christmas or New Years.  You have other skills? Sewing? Knitting?  Something you put yourself into is a far greater gift than something you would buy at the store or online.",

Those are the kinds of things you do for someone when the relationship is great and you really care about them. At least I do.\n\nBought my SB now turned SGF a car in September when hers went out. Bought her a laptop right after when she needed one for nursing school and her screen went out on the one she had. Taking her Christmas shopping tomorrow (among other fun activities). Not bragging, just saying these are the kinds of things you do for someone you care about. This girl makes me the happiest damn guy around. Just sitting next to her eating dinner and looking at her  knowing I'm sitting next to the most beautiful woman on the planet and the fact that she digs me too is just pure joy.\n\nBut, I digress, this was your story.",
