The part I would nitpick is \"weak-ass\" since even though it *leaves* your hair very weak, I don't think a lot of guys understand how strong and damaging these washes can be. \n\nIt depends on your hair type (and that's a matter of chemistry and picking the right non-combo shampoo), but most guys would be far better off using a mild shampoo especially if they wash often.",

If your hair gets dried out from one specific product try a new one.\n\nShe's probably talking about 3-in-1 and 2-in-1 shampoos. 2-in-1 is shampoo and conditioner, 3-in-1 adds body wash.\n\nThis can be a tricky thing to do, because sometimes, in order to put that all together, sacrifices have to be made regarding the strength of each benefit (cleansing hair, skin, and conditioning)\n\nFor example, some surfactants (cleansers) work well on skin but are too weak for the hair and scalp,  sometimes one that works for one benefit can be harmful to another.\n\nI like to tell people to think of it like this:\nYou have one bottle to put three \"genies\" in. Each genie does one job, hair, skin or condition. \n\nIf you put an extra large shampoo genie in there you only have room for two medium genies for skin and conditioning, or one large for skin and a small for conditioning, and so on.\n\nYes, it's a lot more complicated than that but you get the idea.\n\nSo one brand's product might dry out your hair (scalp more likely) just try a new one. There will be different ingredients and strength levels in each one.\n",

Your body also naturally produces oils, but will self-adjust over time.\n\nSo, if you use too much shampoo, your hair's oil production will kick into overtime, all the time. If you use shampoo sparingly (no more than 2x a week!) and then supplement with conditioner, your body will actually produce less oil. So, counterintuitively, the best way to avoid overly oily hair is to shampoo less, not more.",

If you wash your hair every day, you're making your scalp dry every day, and it's compensating by pumping out a lot of oil. \n\nThe result is that your hair looks fine after washing, but by the end of the day it's greasy without fail.\n\nVaries person-to-person - some people's scalps don't respond as extremely. These people are left with dry hair all the time and end up with flakey scalp/hay-for-hair.\n\nShort answer is, use shampoo and conditioner, and avoid doing it every day.",

If you use shampoo sparingly (no more than 2x a week!) and then supplement with conditioner, your body will actually produce less oil. So, counterintuitively, the best way to avoid overly oily hair is to shampoo less, not more.",
