                                                    "body": "It's almost self explanatory :) \n\nIf you focus on Hiruzen's decisions and solutions, many of them feel like something actually Danzo would do. Sandaime Hokage is extremely contradictory. \n\nMany of these things can be explained as plot holes. \n\nOr as this theory. \n\nKotoamatsukami user makes their victim sort of an actor - victim appears to act accordingly to their own will, to actually work for the sharingan user. They're also completely unaware of the situation. Trucking both themselves and their close ones. This makes it prone to paradoxes! Some action might be too contradictory. But more on this later. Just bear in mind that Danzo was capable of using Kotoamatsukami every few dozens of hours thanks to Hashirama cells. \n\nHiruzen almost completely abandoned Naruto, didn't seem to do much about his well being, providing him a guardian, foster parent, hell, even contact his godfather. At least he could've cover up Naruto being a jinchuuriki or protect him from bad fame. Instead somehow everyone knew about it. So did Danzo, which means he had the opportunity to plot this - Shisui's eye was already a thing back then. And Hiruzen was totally chill about Naruto's situation, ignoring dying wish of his protege and succesor - Minato. For Danzo this was a good opportunity: to demonize Naruto, hoping he'll become a menace and later maybe even a real threat to Konoha (IMHO this would work for almost anyone, but not on Asura's incarnation - Danzo's plan was good, if not a literal divine intervention of little kid being an incarnation of ninja demigod). This way Danzo could also kill Naruto, extract the beast with already abundant sharingan power. Kotoamatsukami his ass with some \"homicide was the only solution to this problem\" and enjoy his new tailed beast. \n\nHiruzen also let the massacre happen by giving Danzo too much power and letting the guy do whatever the heck he wanted. This includes letting Danzo get away with literal genocide on the civilians of Konoha! Simultaneously including the whole police force. If that wasn't enough it's still the Uchicha - one of the two OG clans of Konoha. Danzo should've been fucking executed or banished for his actions. Instead Hiruzen declared he'll strip away Danzo from his power, but didn't do shit. Danzo only did some \"Bravo 6 going dark\" kinda shit and lead to creation of the Root. Root was pretty much his own secret anbu force. Status quo. Weird right?\n\n*Puts on his tinfoil hat*\n\nNot weird, if you count in Danzo's favorite skill. There was a big conflict in Hiruzen - Kotoamatsukami forced him to do as Danzo pleases, but at the same time still act how Hokage should act, as Kotoamatsukami is extremely subtle justsu. Designed to keep it's victim unaware, remember? \n\nSo basically Hokage was Danzo's wildcard to cover up viscious, unethical actions, still walking and talking like Hokage should.\n\nEven though Hiruzen was supposed to carry the will of fire (which means: peace through unity and love), what happened was the opposite. Hiruzen's lack of initiative lead to peace mostly by violence (or by Danzo, if prefer). He kept talking how he wants peace with Uchicha, but his actions spoke otherwise - which is a perfect example of being a victim of Kotoamatsukami, where the victim believes he's doing what's right with him, actually for the user of Shisui's eye. \n\nHokage, being the biggest badass and ruler of the village somehow still let Uchicha isolate and fueled their lack of integrity.\n\nGoing back to Kotoamatsukami. It's hard to say what was the extent of this, just imagine being Danzo and being capable of completely bamboozling one person per day, without them ever noticing. Whom would you use? I'd say \"pick the most powerful dude, who was your friend (or Dumbledore-style toxic lover) anyway and make him let you control the whole village from behind the scenes\".\n\n\nNot enough? No worries. I can do this whole day. Remember the downfall of Uchicha and how Danzo didn't even try to cover up his involvement? Hiruzen tells Itachi after the massacre: \"it's sad, that there was no other way\".\n\nWait what? \n\nThat's not anything Hokage would say, but man, it's exactly what Danzo would want Hiruzen to say. Just like it was that Hiruzen was under Danzo's control. Believing in love and unity, knowing about risk of coup d'etat and just letting shit happen like he wasn't even there. \n\nI actually shat my pants for a moment. I thought Danzo might not have his eye and arm replaced yet and had to youtube to be sure, but yeah, this situation could actually be Danzo's test run of his new Kotoamatsukami or maybe first real test if he can keep Hiruzen in the dark.\n\nAnd well Danzo could hope for getting more eyes of the Uchicha (well, he eats them up like they're some dango rice balls) the same way he could've hoped to get Kurama: Find new power. Make sure the user of the power becomes a menace to society. Kill him. \"This was the only way\" no-jutsu on Hiruzen. Bang. Enjoy your new power and even more control.\n\n\nAnd let me add some icing to this cake. This meme. Minato was exhausted, almost dead from lack of chakra, and he's no chakra beast like Kisame or Naruto. Still managed to seal the strongest tailed beast and even tweak it a little to give Naruto only a half and leave some of his parents chakra inside the seal. And Hiruzen was old, but still had some steam in him and was in perfect physical shape. He was a Hokage, S-tier shinobi! Like Tsuchikage. Remember \u014cnoki? Age doesn't matter. \u014cnoki was probably even older and in way worse shape than Hiruzen. Maybe he was a bit too beat up (and penetrated with a sword), but we're talking Kurama here. Why the hell wasn't he able to pull in Orochimaru of all dudes? He believed he's too weak. Orochimaru believed that too. \n\nBut what if Hiruzen was surprised for a reason and wasn't too weak at all? Danzo needed Orochimaru, his espionage and his medical skills. Maybe it was all a farce and Hiruzen was programmed with a 'watchdog' to not kill Orochimaru? Sort of a compromise to make this all stick together! 3rd sealed his arms, not his ass.\n\n(Shinigami's belly now contains: two legendary sannin arms, four Konoha Kage and yin half of the nine tailed beast. What an oddly specific mix)\n\nIt would be a shame if someone could make Sarutobi do some dumb shit instead of most efficient tactics available, amirite? Like, let's say, picking the dumbest fucking jutsu to seal Orochimaru away and act like \"that was the only choice!\". Or make it look like it. Sounds familiar? Well, not without a reason!",

                                            "body": "It's almost self explanatory :) \n\nIf you focus on Hiruzen's decisions and solutions, many of them feel like something actually Danzo would do. Sandaime Hokage is extremely contradictory. \n\nMany of these things can be explained as plot holes. \n\nOr as this theory. \n\nKotoamatsukami user makes their victim sort of an actor - victim appears to act accordingly to their own will, to actually work for the sharingan user. They're also completely unaware of the situation. Trucking both themselves and their close ones. This makes it prone to paradoxes! Some action might be too contradictory. But more on this later. Just bear in mind that Danzo was capable of using Kotoamatsukami every few dozens of hours thanks to Hashirama cells. \n\nHiruzen almost completely abandoned Naruto, didn't seem to do much about his well being, providing him a guardian, foster parent, hell, even contact his godfather. At least he could've cover up Naruto being a jinchuuriki or protect him from bad fame. Instead somehow everyone knew about it. So did Danzo, which means he had the opportunity to plot this - Shisui's eye was already a thing back then. And Hiruzen was totally chill about Naruto's situation, ignoring dying wish of his protege and succesor - Minato. For Danzo this was a good opportunity: to demonize Naruto, hoping he'll become a menace and later maybe even a real threat to Konoha (IMHO this would work for almost anyone, but not on Asura's incarnation - Danzo's plan was good, if not a literal divine intervention of little kid being an incarnation of ninja demigod). This way Danzo could also kill Naruto, extract the beast with already abundant sharingan power. Kotoamatsukami his ass with some \"homicide was the only solution to this problem\" and enjoy his new tailed beast. \n\nHiruzen also let the massacre happen by giving Danzo too much power and letting the guy do whatever the heck he wanted. This includes letting Danzo get away with literal genocide on the civilians of Konoha! Simultaneously including the whole police force. If that wasn't enough it's still the Uchicha - one of the two OG clans of Konoha. Danzo should've been fucking executed or banished for his actions. Instead Hiruzen declared he'll strip away Danzo from his power, but didn't do shit. Danzo only did some \"Bravo 6 going dark\" kinda shit and lead to creation of the Root. Root was pretty much his own secret anbu force. Status quo. Weird right?\n\n*Puts on his tinfoil hat*\n\nNot weird, if you count in Danzo's favorite skill. There was a big conflict in Hiruzen - Kotoamatsukami forced him to do as Danzo pleases, but at the same time still act how Hokage should act, as Kotoamatsukami is extremely subtle justsu. Designed to keep it's victim unaware, remember? \n\nSo basically Hokage was Danzo's wildcard to cover up viscious, unethical actions, still walking and talking like Hokage should.\n\nEven though Hiruzen was supposed to carry the will of fire (which means: peace through unity and love), what happened was the opposite. Hiruzen's lack of initiative lead to peace mostly by violence (or by Danzo, if prefer). He kept talking how he wants peace with Uchicha, but his actions spoke otherwise - which is a perfect example of being a victim of Kotoamatsukami, where the victim believes he's doing what's right with him, actually for the user of Shisui's eye. \n\nHokage, being the biggest badass and ruler of the village somehow still let Uchicha isolate and fueled their lack of integrity.\n\nGoing back to Kotoamatsukami. It's hard to say what was the extent of this, just imagine being Danzo and being capable of completely bamboozling one person per day, without them ever noticing. Whom would you use? I'd say \"pick the most powerful dude, who was your friend (or Dumbledore-style toxic lover) anyway and make him let you control the whole village from behind the scenes\".\n\n\nNot enough? No worries. I can do this whole day. Remember the downfall of Uchicha and how Danzo didn't even try to cover up his involvement? Hiruzen tells Itachi after the massacre: \"it's sad, that there was no other way\".\n\nWait what? \n\nThat's not anything Hokage would say, but man, it's exactly what Danzo would want Hiruzen to say. Just like it was that Hiruzen was under Danzo's control. Believing in love and unity, knowing about risk of coup d'etat and just letting shit happen like he wasn't even there. \n\nI actually shat my pants for a moment. I thought Danzo might not have his eye and arm replaced yet and had to youtube to be sure, but yeah, this situation could actually be Danzo's test run of his new Kotoamatsukami or maybe first real test if he can keep Hiruzen in the dark.\n\nAnd well Danzo could hope for getting more eyes of the Uchicha (well, he eats them up like they're some dango rice balls) the same way he could've hoped to get Kurama: Find new power. Make sure the user of the power becomes a menace to society. Kill him. \"This was the only way\" no-jutsu on Hiruzen. Bang. Enjoy your new power and even more control.\n\n\nAnd let me add some icing to this cake. This meme. Minato was exhausted, almost dead from lack of chakra, and he's no chakra beast like Kisame or Naruto. Still managed to seal the strongest tailed beast and even tweak it a little to give Naruto only a half and leave some of his parents chakra inside the seal. And Hiruzen was old, but still had some steam in him and was in perfect physical shape. He was a Hokage, S-tier shinobi! Like Tsuchikage. Remember \u014cnoki? Age doesn't matter. \u014cnoki was probably even older and in way worse shape than Hiruzen. Maybe he was a bit too beat up (and penetrated with a sword), but we're talking Kurama here. Why the hell wasn't he able to pull in Orochimaru of all dudes? He believed he's too weak. Orochimaru believed that too. \n\nBut what if Hiruzen was surprised for a reason and wasn't too weak at all? Danzo needed Orochimaru, his espionage and his medical skills. Maybe it was all a farce and Hiruzen was programmed with a 'watchdog' to not kill Orochimaru? Sort of a compromise to make this all stick together! 3rd sealed his arms, not his ass.\n\n(Shinigami's belly now contains: two legendary sannin arms, four Konoha Kage and yin half of the nine tailed beast. What an oddly specific mix)\n\nIt would be a shame if someone could make Sarutobi do some dumb shit instead of most efficient tactics available, amirite? Like, let's say, picking the dumbest fucking jutsu to seal Orochimaru away and act like \"that was the only choice!\". Or make it look like it. Sounds familiar? Well, not without a reason!",

                                    "body": "It's almost self explanatory :) \n\nIf you focus on Hiruzen's decisions and solutions, many of them feel like something actually Danzo would do. Sandaime Hokage is extremely contradictory. \n\nMany of these things can be explained as plot holes. \n\nOr as this theory. \n\nKotoamatsukami user makes their victim sort of an actor - victim appears to act accordingly to their own will, to actually work for the sharingan user. They're also completely unaware of the situation. Trucking both themselves and their close ones. This makes it prone to paradoxes! Some action might be too contradictory. But more on this later. Just bear in mind that Danzo was capable of using Kotoamatsukami every few dozens of hours thanks to Hashirama cells. \n\nHiruzen almost completely abandoned Naruto, didn't seem to do much about his well being, providing him a guardian, foster parent, hell, even contact his godfather. At least he could've cover up Naruto being a jinchuuriki or protect him from bad fame. Instead somehow everyone knew about it. So did Danzo, which means he had the opportunity to plot this - Shisui's eye was already a thing back then. And Hiruzen was totally chill about Naruto's situation, ignoring dying wish of his protege and succesor - Minato. For Danzo this was a good opportunity: to demonize Naruto, hoping he'll become a menace and later maybe even a real threat to Konoha (IMHO this would work for almost anyone, but not on Asura's incarnation - Danzo's plan was good, if not a literal divine intervention of little kid being an incarnation of ninja demigod). This way Danzo could also kill Naruto, extract the beast with already abundant sharingan power. Kotoamatsukami his ass with some \"homicide was the only solution to this problem\" and enjoy his new tailed beast. \n\nHiruzen also let the massacre happen by giving Danzo too much power and letting the guy do whatever the heck he wanted. This includes letting Danzo get away with literal genocide on the civilians of Konoha! Simultaneously including the whole police force. If that wasn't enough it's still the Uchicha - one of the two OG clans of Konoha. Danzo should've been fucking executed or banished for his actions. Instead Hiruzen declared he'll strip away Danzo from his power, but didn't do shit. Danzo only did some \"Bravo 6 going dark\" kinda shit and lead to creation of the Root. Root was pretty much his own secret anbu force. Status quo. Weird right?\n\n*Puts on his tinfoil hat*\n\nNot weird, if you count in Danzo's favorite skill. There was a big conflict in Hiruzen - Kotoamatsukami forced him to do as Danzo pleases, but at the same time still act how Hokage should act, as Kotoamatsukami is extremely subtle justsu. Designed to keep it's victim unaware, remember? \n\nSo basically Hokage was Danzo's wildcard to cover up viscious, unethical actions, still walking and talking like Hokage should.\n\nEven though Hiruzen was supposed to carry the will of fire (which means: peace through unity and love), what happened was the opposite. Hiruzen's lack of initiative lead to peace mostly by violence (or by Danzo, if prefer). He kept talking how he wants peace with Uchicha, but his actions spoke otherwise - which is a perfect example of being a victim of Kotoamatsukami, where the victim believes he's doing what's right with him, actually for the user of Shisui's eye. \n\nHokage, being the biggest badass and ruler of the village somehow still let Uchicha isolate and fueled their lack of integrity.\n\nGoing back to Kotoamatsukami. It's hard to say what was the extent of this, just imagine being Danzo and being capable of completely bamboozling one person per day, without them ever noticing. Whom would you use? I'd say \"pick the most powerful dude, who was your friend (or Dumbledore-style toxic lover) anyway and make him let you control the whole village from behind the scenes\".\n\n\nNot enough? No worries. I can do this whole day. Remember the downfall of Uchicha and how Danzo didn't even try to cover up his involvement? Hiruzen tells Itachi after the massacre: \"it's sad, that there was no other way\".\n\nWait what? \n\nThat's not anything Hokage would say, but man, it's exactly what Danzo would want Hiruzen to say. Just like it was that Hiruzen was under Danzo's control. Believing in love and unity, knowing about risk of coup d'etat and just letting shit happen like he wasn't even there. \n\nI actually shat my pants for a moment. I thought Danzo might not have his eye and arm replaced yet and had to youtube to be sure, but yeah, this situation could actually be Danzo's test run of his new Kotoamatsukami or maybe first real test if he can keep Hiruzen in the dark.\n\nAnd well Danzo could hope for getting more eyes of the Uchicha (well, he eats them up like they're some dango rice balls) the same way he could've hoped to get Kurama: Find new power. Make sure the user of the power becomes a menace to society. Kill him. \"This was the only way\" no-jutsu on Hiruzen. Bang. Enjoy your new power and even more control.\n\n\nAnd let me add some icing to this cake. This meme. Minato was exhausted, almost dead from lack of chakra, and he's no chakra beast like Kisame or Naruto. Still managed to seal the strongest tailed beast and even tweak it a little to give Naruto only a half and leave some of his parents chakra inside the seal. And Hiruzen was old, but still had some steam in him and was in perfect physical shape. He was a Hokage, S-tier shinobi! Like Tsuchikage. Remember \u014cnoki? Age doesn't matter. \u014cnoki was probably even older and in way worse shape than Hiruzen. Maybe he was a bit too beat up (and penetrated with a sword), but we're talking Kurama here. Why the hell wasn't he able to pull in Orochimaru of all dudes? He believed he's too weak. Orochimaru believed that too. \n\nBut what if Hiruzen was surprised for a reason and wasn't too weak at all? Danzo needed Orochimaru, his espionage and his medical skills. Maybe it was all a farce and Hiruzen was programmed with a 'watchdog' to not kill Orochimaru? Sort of a compromise to make this all stick together! 3rd sealed his arms, not his ass.\n\n(Shinigami's belly now contains: two legendary sannin arms, four Konoha Kage and yin half of the nine tailed beast. What an oddly specific mix)\n\nIt would be a shame if someone could make Sarutobi do some dumb shit instead of most efficient tactics available, amirite? Like, let's say, picking the dumbest fucking jutsu to seal Orochimaru away and act like \"that was the only choice!\". Or make it look like it. Sounds familiar? Well, not without a reason!",

The kazekage rescue arc adapt 37 chapters into 32 episodes which is fucking terrible, but it was because the main staff haven\u2019t returned yet due to the filler hell in OG Naruto",

                            "body": "It's almost self explanatory :) \n\nIf you focus on Hiruzen's decisions and solutions, many of them feel like something actually Danzo would do. Sandaime Hokage is extremely contradictory. \n\nMany of these things can be explained as plot holes. \n\nOr as this theory. \n\nKotoamatsukami user makes their victim sort of an actor - victim appears to act accordingly to their own will, to actually work for the sharingan user. They're also completely unaware of the situation. Trucking both themselves and their close ones. This makes it prone to paradoxes! Some action might be too contradictory. But more on this later. Just bear in mind that Danzo was capable of using Kotoamatsukami every few dozens of hours thanks to Hashirama cells. \n\nHiruzen almost completely abandoned Naruto, didn't seem to do much about his well being, providing him a guardian, foster parent, hell, even contact his godfather. At least he could've cover up Naruto being a jinchuuriki or protect him from bad fame. Instead somehow everyone knew about it. So did Danzo, which means he had the opportunity to plot this - Shisui's eye was already a thing back then. And Hiruzen was totally chill about Naruto's situation, ignoring dying wish of his protege and succesor - Minato. For Danzo this was a good opportunity: to demonize Naruto, hoping he'll become a menace and later maybe even a real threat to Konoha (IMHO this would work for almost anyone, but not on Asura's incarnation - Danzo's plan was good, if not a literal divine intervention of little kid being an incarnation of ninja demigod). This way Danzo could also kill Naruto, extract the beast with already abundant sharingan power. Kotoamatsukami his ass with some \"homicide was the only solution to this problem\" and enjoy his new tailed beast. \n\nHiruzen also let the massacre happen by giving Danzo too much power and letting the guy do whatever the heck he wanted. This includes letting Danzo get away with literal genocide on the civilians of Konoha! Simultaneously including the whole police force. If that wasn't enough it's still the Uchicha - one of the two OG clans of Konoha. Danzo should've been fucking executed or banished for his actions. Instead Hiruzen declared he'll strip away Danzo from his power, but didn't do shit. Danzo only did some \"Bravo 6 going dark\" kinda shit and lead to creation of the Root. Root was pretty much his own secret anbu force. Status quo. Weird right?\n\n*Puts on his tinfoil hat*\n\nNot weird, if you count in Danzo's favorite skill. There was a big conflict in Hiruzen - Kotoamatsukami forced him to do as Danzo pleases, but at the same time still act how Hokage should act, as Kotoamatsukami is extremely subtle justsu. Designed to keep it's victim unaware, remember? \n\nSo basically Hokage was Danzo's wildcard to cover up viscious, unethical actions, still walking and talking like Hokage should.\n\nEven though Hiruzen was supposed to carry the will of fire (which means: peace through unity and love), what happened was the opposite. Hiruzen's lack of initiative lead to peace mostly by violence (or by Danzo, if prefer). He kept talking how he wants peace with Uchicha, but his actions spoke otherwise - which is a perfect example of being a victim of Kotoamatsukami, where the victim believes he's doing what's right with him, actually for the user of Shisui's eye. \n\nHokage, being the biggest badass and ruler of the village somehow still let Uchicha isolate and fueled their lack of integrity.\n\nGoing back to Kotoamatsukami. It's hard to say what was the extent of this, just imagine being Danzo and being capable of completely bamboozling one person per day, without them ever noticing. Whom would you use? I'd say \"pick the most powerful dude, who was your friend (or Dumbledore-style toxic lover) anyway and make him let you control the whole village from behind the scenes\".\n\n\nNot enough? No worries. I can do this whole day. Remember the downfall of Uchicha and how Danzo didn't even try to cover up his involvement? Hiruzen tells Itachi after the massacre: \"it's sad, that there was no other way\".\n\nWait what? \n\nThat's not anything Hokage would say, but man, it's exactly what Danzo would want Hiruzen to say. Just like it was that Hiruzen was under Danzo's control. Believing in love and unity, knowing about risk of coup d'etat and just letting shit happen like he wasn't even there. \n\nI actually shat my pants for a moment. I thought Danzo might not have his eye and arm replaced yet and had to youtube to be sure, but yeah, this situation could actually be Danzo's test run of his new Kotoamatsukami or maybe first real test if he can keep Hiruzen in the dark.\n\nAnd well Danzo could hope for getting more eyes of the Uchicha (well, he eats them up like they're some dango rice balls) the same way he could've hoped to get Kurama: Find new power. Make sure the user of the power becomes a menace to society. Kill him. \"This was the only way\" no-jutsu on Hiruzen. Bang. Enjoy your new power and even more control.\n\n\nAnd let me add some icing to this cake. This meme. Minato was exhausted, almost dead from lack of chakra, and he's no chakra beast like Kisame or Naruto. Still managed to seal the strongest tailed beast and even tweak it a little to give Naruto only a half and leave some of his parents chakra inside the seal. And Hiruzen was old, but still had some steam in him and was in perfect physical shape. He was a Hokage, S-tier shinobi! Like Tsuchikage. Remember \u014cnoki? Age doesn't matter. \u014cnoki was probably even older and in way worse shape than Hiruzen. Maybe he was a bit too beat up (and penetrated with a sword), but we're talking Kurama here. Why the hell wasn't he able to pull in Orochimaru of all dudes? He believed he's too weak. Orochimaru believed that too. \n\nBut what if Hiruzen was surprised for a reason and wasn't too weak at all? Danzo needed Orochimaru, his espionage and his medical skills. Maybe it was all a farce and Hiruzen was programmed with a 'watchdog' to not kill Orochimaru? Sort of a compromise to make this all stick together! 3rd sealed his arms, not his ass.\n\n(Shinigami's belly now contains: two legendary sannin arms, four Konoha Kage and yin half of the nine tailed beast. What an oddly specific mix)\n\nIt would be a shame if someone could make Sarutobi do some dumb shit instead of most efficient tactics available, amirite? Like, let's say, picking the dumbest fucking jutsu to seal Orochimaru away and act like \"that was the only choice!\". Or make it look like it. Sounds familiar? Well, not without a reason!",

The kazekage rescue arc adapt 37 chapters into 32 episodes which is fucking terrible, but it was because the main staff haven\u2019t returned yet due to the filler hell in OG Naruto",

Sandaime Hokage is extremely contradictory. \n\nMany of these things can be explained as plot holes. \n\nOr as this theory. \n\nKotoamatsukami user makes their victim sort of an actor - victim appears to act accordingly to their own will, to actually work for the sharingan user. They're also completely unaware of the situation. Trucking both themselves and their close ones. This makes it prone to paradoxes! Some action might be too contradictory. But more on this later. Just bear in mind that Danzo was capable of using Kotoamatsukami every few dozens of hours thanks to Hashirama cells. \n\nHiruzen almost completely abandoned Naruto, didn't seem to do much about his well being, providing him a guardian, foster parent, hell, even contact his godfather. At least he could've cover up Naruto being a jinchuuriki or protect him from bad fame. Instead somehow everyone knew about it. So did Danzo, which means he had the opportunity to plot this - Shisui's eye was already a thing back then. And Hiruzen was totally chill about Naruto's situation, ignoring dying wish of his protege and succesor - Minato. For Danzo this was a good opportunity: to demonize Naruto, hoping he'll become a menace and later maybe even a real threat to Konoha (IMHO this would work for almost anyone, but not on Asura's incarnation - Danzo's plan was good, if not a literal divine intervention of little kid being an incarnation of ninja demigod). This way Danzo could also kill Naruto, extract the beast with already abundant sharingan power. Kotoamatsukami his ass with some \"homicide was the only solution to this problem\" and enjoy his new tailed beast. \n\nHiruzen also let the massacre happen by giving Danzo too much power and letting the guy do whatever the heck he wanted. This includes letting Danzo get away with literal genocide on the civilians of Konoha! Simultaneously including the whole police force. If that wasn't enough it's still the Uchicha - one of the two OG clans of Konoha. Danzo should've been fucking executed or banished for his actions. Instead Hiruzen declared he'll strip away Danzo from his power, but didn't do shit. Danzo only did some \"Bravo 6 going dark\" kinda shit and lead to creation of the Root. Root was pretty much his own secret anbu force. Status quo. Weird right?\n\n*Puts on his tinfoil hat*\n\nNot weird, if you count in Danzo's favorite skill. There was a big conflict in Hiruzen - Kotoamatsukami forced him to do as Danzo pleases, but at the same time still act how Hokage should act, as Kotoamatsukami is extremely subtle justsu. Designed to keep it's victim unaware, remember? \n\nSo basically Hokage was Danzo's wildcard to cover up viscious, unethical actions, still walking and talking like Hokage should.\n\nEven though Hiruzen was supposed to carry the will of fire (which means: peace through unity and love), what happened was the opposite. Hiruzen's lack of initiative lead to peace mostly by violence (or by Danzo, if prefer). He kept talking how he wants peace with Uchicha, but his actions spoke otherwise - which is a perfect example of being a victim of Kotoamatsukami, where the victim believes he's doing what's right with him, actually for the user of Shisui's eye. \n\nHokage, being the biggest badass and ruler of the village somehow still let Uchicha isolate and fueled their lack of integrity.\n\nGoing back to Kotoamatsukami. It's hard to say what was the extent of this, just imagine being Danzo and being capable of completely bamboozling one person per day, without them ever noticing. Whom would you use? I'd say \"pick the most powerful dude, who was your friend (or Dumbledore-style toxic lover) anyway and make him let you control the whole village from behind the scenes\".\n\n\nNot enough? No worries. I can do this whole day. Remember the downfall of Uchicha and how Danzo didn't even try to cover up his involvement? Hiruzen tells Itachi after the massacre: \"it's sad, that there was no other way\".\n\nWait what? \n\nThat's not anything Hokage would say, but man, it's exactly what Danzo would want Hiruzen to say. Just like it was that Hiruzen was under Danzo's control. Believing in love and unity, knowing about risk of coup d'etat and just letting shit happen like he wasn't even there. \n\nI actually shat my pants for a moment. I thought Danzo might not have his eye and arm replaced yet and had to youtube to be sure, but yeah, this situation could actually be Danzo's test run of his new Kotoamatsukami or maybe first real test if he can keep Hiruzen in the dark.\n\nAnd well Danzo could hope for getting more eyes of the Uchicha (well, he eats them up like they're some dango rice balls) the same way he could've hoped to get Kurama: Find new power. Make sure the user of the power becomes a menace to society. Kill him. \"This was the only way\" no-jutsu on Hiruzen. Bang. Enjoy your new power and even more control.\n\n\nAnd let me add some icing to this cake. This meme. Minato was exhausted, almost dead from lack of chakra, and he's no chakra beast like Kisame or Naruto. Still managed to seal the strongest tailed beast and even tweak it a little to give Naruto only a half and leave some of his parents chakra inside the seal. And Hiruzen was old, but still had some steam in him and was in perfect physical shape. He was a Hokage, S-tier shinobi! Like Tsuchikage. Remember \u014cnoki? Age doesn't matter. \u014cnoki was probably even older and in way worse shape than Hiruzen. Maybe he was a bit too beat up (and penetrated with a sword), but we're talking Kurama here. Why the hell wasn't he able to pull in Orochimaru of all dudes? He believed he's too weak. Orochimaru believed that too. \n\nBut what if Hiruzen was surprised for a reason and wasn't too weak at all? Danzo needed Orochimaru, his espionage and his medical skills. Maybe it was all a farce and Hiruzen was programmed with a 'watchdog' to not kill Orochimaru? Sort of a compromise to make this all stick together! 3rd sealed his arms, not his ass.\n\n(Shinigami's belly now contains: two legendary sannin arms, four Konoha Kage and yin half of the nine tailed beast. What an oddly specific mix)\n\nIt would be a shame if someone could make Sarutobi do some dumb shit instead of most efficient tactics available, amirite? Like, let's say, picking the dumbest fucking jutsu to seal Orochimaru away and act like \"that was the only choice!\". Or make it look like it. Sounds familiar? Well, not without a reason!",

            "body": "It's almost self explanatory :) \n\nIf you focus on Hiruzen's decisions and solutions, many of them feel like something actually Danzo would do. Sandaime Hokage is extremely contradictory. \n\nMany of these things can be explained as plot holes. \n\nOr as this theory. \n\nKotoamatsukami user makes their victim sort of an actor - victim appears to act accordingly to their own will, to actually work for the sharingan user. They're also completely unaware of the situation. Trucking both themselves and their close ones. This makes it prone to paradoxes! Some action might be too contradictory. But more on this later. Just bear in mind that Danzo was capable of using Kotoamatsukami every few dozens of hours thanks to Hashirama cells. \n\nHiruzen almost completely abandoned Naruto, didn't seem to do much about his well being, providing him a guardian, foster parent, hell, even contact his godfather. At least he could've cover up Naruto being a jinchuuriki or protect him from bad fame. Instead somehow everyone knew about it. So did Danzo, which means he had the opportunity to plot this - Shisui's eye was already a thing back then. And Hiruzen was totally chill about Naruto's situation, ignoring dying wish of his protege and succesor - Minato. For Danzo this was a good opportunity: to demonize Naruto, hoping he'll become a menace and later maybe even a real threat to Konoha (IMHO this would work for almost anyone, but not on Asura's incarnation - Danzo's plan was good, if not a literal divine intervention of little kid being an incarnation of ninja demigod). This way Danzo could also kill Naruto, extract the beast with already abundant sharingan power. Kotoamatsukami his ass with some \"homicide was the only solution to this problem\" and enjoy his new tailed beast. \n\nHiruzen also let the massacre happen by giving Danzo too much power and letting the guy do whatever the heck he wanted. This includes letting Danzo get away with literal genocide on the civilians of Konoha! Simultaneously including the whole police force. If that wasn't enough it's still the Uchicha - one of the two OG clans of Konoha. Danzo should've been fucking executed or banished for his actions. Instead Hiruzen declared he'll strip away Danzo from his power, but didn't do shit. Danzo only did some \"Bravo 6 going dark\" kinda shit and lead to creation of the Root. Root was pretty much his own secret anbu force. Status quo. Weird right?\n\n*Puts on his tinfoil hat*\n\nNot weird, if you count in Danzo's favorite skill. There was a big conflict in Hiruzen - Kotoamatsukami forced him to do as Danzo pleases, but at the same time still act how Hokage should act, as Kotoamatsukami is extremely subtle justsu. Designed to keep it's victim unaware, remember? \n\nSo basically Hokage was Danzo's wildcard to cover up viscious, unethical actions, still walking and talking like Hokage should.\n\nEven though Hiruzen was supposed to carry the will of fire (which means: peace through unity and love), what happened was the opposite. Hiruzen's lack of initiative lead to peace mostly by violence (or by Danzo, if prefer). He kept talking how he wants peace with Uchicha, but his actions spoke otherwise - which is a perfect example of being a victim of Kotoamatsukami, where the victim believes he's doing what's right with him, actually for the user of Shisui's eye. \n\nHokage, being the biggest badass and ruler of the village somehow still let Uchicha isolate and fueled their lack of integrity.\n\nGoing back to Kotoamatsukami. It's hard to say what was the extent of this, just imagine being Danzo and being capable of completely bamboozling one person per day, without them ever noticing. Whom would you use? I'd say \"pick the most powerful dude, who was your friend (or Dumbledore-style toxic lover) anyway and make him let you control the whole village from behind the scenes\".\n\n\nNot enough? No worries. I can do this whole day. Remember the downfall of Uchicha and how Danzo didn't even try to cover up his involvement? Hiruzen tells Itachi after the massacre: \"it's sad, that there was no other way\".\n\nWait what? \n\nThat's not anything Hokage would say, but man, it's exactly what Danzo would want Hiruzen to say. Just like it was that Hiruzen was under Danzo's control. Believing in love and unity, knowing about risk of coup d'etat and just letting shit happen like he wasn't even there. \n\nI actually shat my pants for a moment. I thought Danzo might not have his eye and arm replaced yet and had to youtube to be sure, but yeah, this situation could actually be Danzo's test run of his new Kotoamatsukami or maybe first real test if he can keep Hiruzen in the dark.\n\nAnd well Danzo could hope for getting more eyes of the Uchicha (well, he eats them up like they're some dango rice balls) the same way he could've hoped to get Kurama: Find new power. Make sure the user of the power becomes a menace to society. Kill him. \"This was the only way\" no-jutsu on Hiruzen. Bang. Enjoy your new power and even more control.\n\n\nAnd let me add some icing to this cake. This meme. Minato was exhausted, almost dead from lack of chakra, and he's no chakra beast like Kisame or Naruto. Still managed to seal the strongest tailed beast and even tweak it a little to give Naruto only a half and leave some of his parents chakra inside the seal. And Hiruzen was old, but still had some steam in him and was in perfect physical shape. He was a Hokage, S-tier shinobi! Like Tsuchikage. Remember \u014cnoki? Age doesn't matter. \u014cnoki was probably even older and in way worse shape than Hiruzen. Maybe he was a bit too beat up (and penetrated with a sword), but we're talking Kurama here. Why the hell wasn't he able to pull in Orochimaru of all dudes? He believed he's too weak. Orochimaru believed that too. \n\nBut what if Hiruzen was surprised for a reason and wasn't too weak at all? Danzo needed Orochimaru, his espionage and his medical skills. Maybe it was all a farce and Hiruzen was programmed with a 'watchdog' to not kill Orochimaru? Sort of a compromise to make this all stick together! 3rd sealed his arms, not his ass.\n\n(Shinigami's belly now contains: two legendary sannin arms, four Konoha Kage and yin half of the nine tailed beast. What an oddly specific mix)\n\nIt would be a shame if someone could make Sarutobi do some dumb shit instead of most efficient tactics available, amirite? Like, let's say, picking the dumbest fucking jutsu to seal Orochimaru away and act like \"that was the only choice!\". Or make it look like it. Sounds familiar? Well, not without a reason!",
