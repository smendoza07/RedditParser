    "body": "I went out to a restaurant last night and it was fun to be out in public with him. The waitress and table next to us surely had an inkling and I find that kind of amusing. I'm not used to this since my previous SD was discreet so it's a fun change of pace. I thought I'd be embarrassed about people's judgements but any nervousness totally disappeared once I sat down at the table.",

Usually they\u2019re around my age, and once they (and usually their coworkers on shift, lol) know about it, more often than not I receive an even better dining experience because everyone is in on it. One time I had a server whisper to me \u201cget your coin, sis\u201d while leaving the restaurant. It\u2019s honestly very refreshing since I\u2019ve also gotten weird stares in the past.",

They were very engaged and I assumed it was business related until my SB said definitely sugar. I disagreed until the woman stood up and the outfit was way more sexy than business.\n\nRan into them again at the theater. Made me smile.\n\nAnother time I was in the elevator with a younger SB and a grandmother got on with her teenaged grandson (I assume). She engaged me in a conversation about the weather and asked what brought us to town. Most people assume my SB is a daughter or granddaughter, I'm sure.\n\nHotel staff probably have suspicions since so much hotel traffic during the day and for single nights are for sex. Restaurant staff may suspect, too, in some cases. None if them are likely to care. But unless you're dressed very sexy, SB, the two of you are engaging in some clearly sexual/romantic PDA, or the other people play in the bowl, too, I doubt others suspect.\n\nBut, yeah, it is fun going out together. Always have a story ready in case you run into someone you know. It only has happened once walking down the street and my SB just introduced me as her professor, but I like to be ready.",

Once, we stayed for three or four days at a bed and breakfast and would get up and sit at a common table eating and talking to all these other couples, all of whom were even older than myself and were definitely super curious about who we were and how we were together but didn't ask any specific questions.  She had lots of fun with it, including being extra loud when we were having sex in case anyone could hear us.  \n\n\nThe only modestly embarassing moment was when we went horseback riding together, with a guide, and the guide thought she was my daughter and said something to that extent.  My SB, quite predictably, at the end of the ride thanked me for such a wonderful experience and then gave me a big wet kiss in front of our guide.  This experience made me a little nervous as this was near my vacation house and there was a chance, albeit small, I might run into this guide again somewhere when with my wife.",

There was not a huge age gap (5 years) but very large looks difference.  (she was a model).  Was a huge turn on to her, and I certainly wasn't opposed.\n\n2 - Different SB, more standard sugar age gap (she was 21, so ~15 years I think).
