And it was just getting in the way. \n\nI had never had short hair so I just picked something recommended for my triangular face shape and went from there. The final picture I showed the barber was [this](https://men-haircutstyle.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Men-New-Hairstyle-along-with-Latest-Pompadour-Hair-for-Boys.jpg). And even when freshly cut and styled, it was a little different, but I had given him as much freedom as he wanted given my lack of short hair experience. \n\nAlso, first time ever having my beard done too. Definitely gonna get it every time I get my hair cut. \n\nThanks too, for the compliement! <3",

And it was just getting in the way. \n\nI had never had short hair so I just picked something recommended for my triangular face shape and went from there. The final picture I showed the barber was [this](https://men-haircutstyle.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Men-New-Hairstyle-along-with-Latest-Pompadour-Hair-for-Boys.jpg). And even when freshly cut and styled, it was a little different, but I had given him as much freedom as he wanted given my lack of short hair experience. \n\nAlso, first time ever having my beard done too. Definitely gonna get it every time I get my hair cut. \n\nThanks too, for the compliement! <3",
