It's a basic human trait.\n\nBut as a RM member, and one of the best friends of YJS, he would be so glad for him and the team.\n\nHonestly, seeing others lose, I also thought that he was going to win it. That's why it was more sad when his name was not announced because we had prepared that thing in our minds where JSJ would definitely win the prize. And when he didn't, as his fans, we were also disappointed.",
