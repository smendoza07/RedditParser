    "body": "Hello slf!  the mods would like to address a topic of importance to every single  one of us, SB safety and other women's issues in the bowl.  Lately,  these topics have been driven by non-SBs, and have been framed in toxic ways through a gender war lens, in a way that guarantees divisiveness and anger.  It's a shame,  these are  topics that we are all pretty much agreed upon regardless of gender, or present a great opportunity for education.   There's a narrative being constructed that these non-SBs are being  banned from slf because of their posting on women's topics.  Instead,  they are leaving a long trail of toxicity that gets them banned for violations of  rule 1, 12, 14, and especially 9.  Yesterday's poster, after leaving a  long trail of gender hostility, was specifically banned for saying all  SDs need therapy and are psychopaths on a completely different thread, just the final straw (fyi, I  automatically ban redpillers as well, which is why SBs rarely see such posts on slf; those guys don't like me either, they just raise less of a fuss :)\n\nslf is for sugar.  If you believe \"sugar is just escorting with a  different rate\", you probably don't belong here, and won't be allowed to bring your views or attitude here.  There  are lots of other subs where you can express your views with like-minded folks.  If you believe sugar is NOT  just escorting with a different rate, you may belong here (yes,  even if you're an escort -- if you're an SB, you're an SB, regardless of  what else you do).\n\nI -- and all the mods -- want to invite SBs to discuss your issues here. While  all topics will and should generate discussion, questions, debate, and  *respectful disagreement*, we plan to more aggressively ensure there's no  dogpiling or other counterproductive behavior on threads on women's  topics written by actual **SBs** .  I would like to also  personally ask SDs that, when something comes up like an SB describing  an act as rape, you re-consider commenting about whether that particular act  technically falls under the legal definition of rape in your state -- that is  usually not the point that SB is making, and the fact is, we all agree  that acts like stealthing and not giving the PPM are traumatic, unethical, and  unacceptable violations of consent.\n\nSLF's SBs have made me a better SD, and I've seen just today SBs  saying the same thing about SLF's SDs.  Our strength is that have both  SBs and SDs here.  Let's drive out toxic elements who are not really  part of our community, and put in extra effort (I'll put myself at the  front of the line for that) into understanding each other, even if we  don't agree on everything",

Tricking someone out of a PPM and stealthing are both behaviors that are inexcusable and should not be tolerated. We can listen and provide support if that\u2019s what is wanted. We can, and have also, come up with guidelines. It\u2019s helpful not to lump everyone into the same group, not consider all men to have the same views nor all women to have the same motives.",

We process information differently; therefore, It's bound to be some hurt feelings and misunderstandings.  Secondly, there is a generational gap, and our vocabulary has changed drastically within the last four years. It's hard to communicate without offending anyone. At the same time, we can understand what is being said.  Thirdly, some things just get lost in translation, from your brain to the paper.  Let's face it, we Americans aren't winning any high marks in English anymore.  I don't think this is the forum for expressing devasting events simply because it's not a visual medium.",

We pretty much always reply if someone sends a respectful message to Modmail asking why they got banned.  There's also cases of bad aim by the Mod -- there's multiple ways to ban someone, and in one of the ways, it's easy to accidentally ban the thread OP rather than the person in the thread we were actually intending to ban.  We usually catch this super super fast, but sometimes we don't, so we depend on that (respectful please!) Modmail.  We'll hunt it down and reverse it if we got the wrong person",

These girls are not saying that sugaring is just escorting with a different rate, and instead that **the type of sugaring that is heavily promoted here** is escorting with a different rate. And less safety too.\n\nThese girls are \u201ctoxic\u201d but not the men here who push ppm with sex on the first date after a 15min M&G, talk about a \u201cbuyer\u2019s market\u201d, or supply and demand when discussing how much allowance they should give instead of making it about the individual need and helping help their partner, etc. Okay....?\n\nIt\u2019s not even about men, it\u2019s the specific type of men who form a majority of active users on here, they sound a lot more like hobbyists than sugar daddies and if you\u2019ve met hobbyists you know.\n\nBefore I get called a \u201ctoxic sex worker\u201d, let me clarify that I started with SLF style sugaring and took a lot of advice from here, then I escorted for a few months too, and now I sugar exclusively. \n\nThe difference between my current sugar arrangement and SLF-style sugar is greater than between SLF-style sugar and escorting. \n\nI think if you want this subreddit to be specifically about sugar dating and not escorting, it doesn\u2019t make sense to ban the people who argue that what\u2019s being promoted here isn\u2019t really what sugar dating looks like. \n\nWhat does seem biased is exactly the fact that these girls are banned and not men who make statements that should be considered equally outrageous and should make them \u201cnon-SDs\u201d if these girls are \u201cnon-SBs\u201d. When you add to that other factors like the fact that you can talk about every aspect of the arrangement except allowance, it does seem like this is not a place that is designed to be beneficial to SDs and SBs equally. \n\nAlso, unfair to compare to red pill trolls... Someone else has already stated why these girls feel the way they do and why they come here. They have experience with the type of men who post here and probably with the type of sugar talked about here.",

It's quite clear from the context I read that \"sugaring is escorting at a lower rate\" (slightly different than the way I put it) was a general observation about what sugar is in general.  And if they didn't believe sugar was a variation on escorting, they wouldn't call SDs clients and johns (which they do often), refer to allowance as rates (which they do often), advocate strongly for escort protocols around nearly everything (which they do often), say things like \"I don't spend time with any men without getting paid\", express the type of seething anger at SDs, clients, and men in general that are typical of escort forums but not sugar forums (which is a constant in the escorts-pretending-to-be-SBs subs), or talk about how they should create a new version of SA where sexworkers run it (in other words, NO ONE understands sugar except for escorts?).  Most believe these are small variations on each other. This is all crystal clear and easy for anyone to go read, if they have the stomach for it.\n\nThe people getting banned here aren't getting banned for arguing that what's being promoted here isn't sugar, they're being banned for making statements like \"all SDs need therapy and are psychopaths\" (one of a zillion examples of escort sub style man hate), promoting escort values as sugar, and being generally an incredibly toxic presence in the sub.  I agree with you about terms like \"buyers market\" and \"payments\", as I've said elsewhere in this thread, but these are opportunities for discussion and correction of the SDs and SBs using these terms, versus someone who believes everyone of the opposite gender is damaged -- such a person unlikely to ever contribute positively to the sub in any way, and THAT is who gets banned.  It is very similar to the \"redpill\" (I'm using that term wrong, just as a general term for the most disrespectful and john-like SDs) view that sugar is basically escorting, too, and the disrespectful way they talk about women.\n\nAll of my SRs have been so far from escorting that I'm not sure it makes sense to compare.  The experiences are incredibly different.  \n\nThe sub has been better since we started banning them a bit more quickly.  I hope this thread will lead to it being better still.  And we'll keep trying to make changes and improvements, that's all we can do.",

Expecially those with women sharing their traumatic experiences. I'd guess at least 90-95% of women here have had some sort of assault, rape, physical or mental abuse at least once in their lifetime. Hopefully most have escaped the cycle of abuse. Part of that healing process can be in finding self worth, self-confidence and re-establishing their value as a person. The SDs that understand this and treat women with respect, respect their boundaries and comfort zones as well as past can be an amazing thing for a young woman who is a survivor. An understanding SD can provide a safe space for that young woman, help her rebuild and repair the damage that was done. At the end of the arrangement hopefully both of their lives are improved, enriched and they can move on from the experience with fond memories. Those are the kinds of stories I enjoy reading here. How have you improved your SB's life? How did you improve your SD's life? The heartwarming posts about arrangements that went well. \n\nIt seems like a lot had changed here and it is nice to see it get back to being a friendly place and a good resource for new people.",

From what I can tell, SLF is the biggest forum to discuss sugar in the world, and I believe the way we think of it matters.   Perhaps in the future, it could be fodder for an interesting discussion thread for the entire community.  As it is, it's more of the mods putting together guidelines for ourselves as to what we view (and we think the members here view) as sugar.\n\nI do think the little rule of thumb I mentioned -- do you believe sugar is just escorting with different rates -- is a pretty quick and easy way to determine who **isn't** an SB or SD (yes, both).  This is the clear belief in many of the sexworker subs.  Not surprisingly, it is exactly the same belief among the redpillers and other toxic faux SDs who come in here.  Both groups are incredibly disruptive, divisive, and toxic here, because they're not in the right place; the main difference is we ban the redpillers faster and they leave quietly once they're gone.  But two sides of the same coin, and both fail the \"just different rates\" test.\n\nNo hard feelings for those who fail that test.  Vaya con Dios, good luck on your journey, but this isn't the right sub for you -- good news, there are a LOT of alternative subs.\n\nAnyway, just thinking out loud.",

If you have surveyed this it would be interesting to see the results and why some SBs feel this way.  May give SDs pause with regard to how we comment.\n\nMGTOW generally identify as fervent anti-feminists who decry gynocentric laws, legal bias, blatant misandry in its many forms, promiscuity, hypergamy, demonization of masculinity etc. and promote avoidance of any form of pair bonding (cohabitation) or even socializing with women.  This hyper critical community is championed by various influencers like Sandman and have a dystopian view of the future of society. Collectively they definitely have disdain for women, especially feminists, openly express it and few would be SDs.\n\nRed Pill (using the Matrix metaphor for accepting gender dynamic realities) as a movement/community tends to be more measured in its assessment of, and in raising awareness of, the realities and associated risks of pair bonding with women but don't eschew engagement or intimate relationships with them.  Redpillars as you refer to them are definitely open to SRs and less likely to be a nuisance here. The true focus of RP philosophy is more about helping men to become better versions of themselves and not misogynistic in nature as opponents claim so as to dismiss and denigrate out of ignorance.\n\nWhile there are definite distinctions between mgtow and RP adherents, both share similar views on many topics and my descriptions are very summary of course.  As such, I don't wish engage in disputes about my characterizations of these movements here.",

It's quite clear from the context I read that \"sugaring is escorting at a lower rate\" (slightly different than the way I put it) was a general observation about what sugar is in general.  And if they didn't believe sugar was a variation on escorting, they wouldn't call SDs clients and johns (which they do often), refer to allowance as rates (which they do often), advocate strongly for escort protocols around nearly everything (which they do often), say things like \"I don't spend time with any men without getting paid\", express the type of seething anger at SDs, clients, and men in general that are typical of escort forums but not sugar forums (which is a constant in the escorts-pretending-to-be-SBs subs), or talk about how they should create a new version of SA where sexworkers run it (in other words, NO ONE understands sugar except for escorts?).  Most believe these are small variations on each other. This is all crystal clear and easy for anyone to go read, if they have the stomach for it.\n\nThe people getting banned here aren't getting banned for arguing that what's being promoted here isn't sugar, they're being banned for making statements like \"all SDs need therapy and are psychopaths\" (one of a zillion examples of escort sub style man hate), promoting escort values as sugar, and being generally an incredibly toxic presence in the sub.  I agree with you about terms like \"buyers market\" and \"payments\", as I've said elsewhere in this thread, but these are opportunities for discussion and correction of the SDs and SBs using these terms, versus someone who believes everyone of the opposite gender is damaged -- such a person unlikely to ever contribute positively to the sub in any way, and THAT is who gets banned.  It is very similar to the \"redpill\" (I'm using that term wrong, just as a general term for the most disrespectful and john-like SDs) view that sugar is basically escorting, too, and the disrespectful way they talk about women.\n\nAll of my SRs have been so far from escorting that I'm not sure it makes sense to compare.  The experiences are incredibly different.  \n\nThe sub has been better since we started banning them a bit more quickly.  I hope this thread will lead to it being better still.  And we'll keep trying to make changes and improvements, that's all we can do.",

From what I can tell, SLF is the biggest forum to discuss sugar in the world, and I believe the way we think of it matters.   Perhaps in the future, it could be fodder for an interesting discussion thread for the entire community.  As it is, it's more of the mods putting together guidelines for ourselves as to what we view (and we think the members here view) as sugar.\n\nI do think the little rule of thumb I mentioned -- do you believe sugar is just escorting with different rates -- is a pretty quick and easy way to determine who **isn't** an SB or SD (yes, both).  This is the clear belief in many of the sexworker subs.  Not surprisingly, it is exactly the same belief among the redpillers and other toxic faux SDs who come in here.  Both groups are incredibly disruptive, divisive, and toxic here, because they're not in the right place; the main difference is we ban the redpillers faster and they leave quietly once they're gone.  But two sides of the same coin, and both fail the \"just different rates\" test.\n\nNo hard feelings for those who fail that test.  Vaya con Dios, good luck on your journey, but this isn't the right sub for you -- good news, there are a LOT of alternative subs.\n\nAnyway, just thinking out loud.",

I'm not talking about controversial topics and the mods almost never seem to ban do to topic, rather for lack of decorum. I refer to the small number of people who get so angry (repeatedly) that they can't discuss those topics without getting nasty. As was the case in this latest incident. \n\n\nI look at it this way. Among my two closest friends. One is a polar opposite from me politically, but  we have wonderful insightful debates because we can do so calmly. The other is very close to me politically, but I avoid any type of debate because he gets angry and rude. For me, the topic isn't always as important as the ability to discuss rationally.\n\n\nAs an old school SR guy. I advocate for the older, slower ways because I remember how much better and safer the bowl was and I catch some shit for it. I join you in wanting the bowl to be a better place. That's largely why I am here. I'm not even in market because my sugar situation is pretty settled in. I'm here for the love of the bowl. And to riff jokes.",

But that doesn't mean there aren't other issues to discuss a different day.

If you have surveyed this it would be interesting to see the results and why some SBs feel this way.  May give SDs pause with regard to how we comment.\n\nMGTOW generally identify as fervent anti-feminists who decry gynocentric laws, legal bias, blatant misandry in its many forms, promiscuity, hypergamy, demonization of masculinity etc. and promote avoidance of any form of pair bonding (cohabitation) or even socializing with women.  This hyper critical community is championed by various influencers like Sandman and have a dystopian view of the future of society. Collectively they definitely have disdain for women, especially feminists, openly express it and few would be SDs.\n\nRed Pill (using the Matrix metaphor for accepting gender dynamic realities) as a movement/community tends to be more measured in its assessment of, and in raising awareness of, the realities and associated risks of pair bonding with women but don't eschew engagement or intimate relationships with them.  Redpillars as you refer to them are definitely open to SRs and less likely to be a nuisance here. The true focus of RP philosophy is more about helping men to become better versions of themselves and not misogynistic in nature as opponents claim so as to dismiss and denigrate out of ignorance.\n\nWhile there are definite distinctions between mgtow and RP adherents, both share similar views on many topics and my descriptions are very summary of course.  As such, I don't wish engage in disputes about my characterizations of these movements here.",

Among my two closest friends. One is a polar opposite from me politically, but  we have wonderful insightful debates because we can do so calmly. The other is very close to me politically, but I avoid any type of debate because he gets angry and rude. For me, the topic isn't always as important as the ability to discuss rationally.\n\n\nAs an old school SR guy. I advocate for the older, slower ways because I remember how much better and safer the bowl was and I catch some shit for it. I join you in wanting the bowl to be a better place.

If you have surveyed this it would be interesting to see the results and why some SBs feel this way.  May give SDs pause with regard to how we comment.\n\nMGTOW generally identify as fervent anti-feminists who decry gynocentric laws, legal bias, blatant misandry in its many forms, promiscuity, hypergamy, demonization of masculinity etc. and promote avoidance of any form of pair bonding (cohabitation) or even socializing with women.  This hyper critical community is championed by various influencers like Sandman and have a dystopian view of the future of society. Collectively they definitely have disdain for women, especially feminists, openly express it and few would be SDs.\n\nRed Pill (using the Matrix metaphor for accepting gender dynamic realities) as a movement/community tends to be more measured in its assessment of, and in raising awareness of, the realities and associated risks of pair bonding with women but don't eschew engagement or intimate relationships with them.  Redpillars as you refer to them are definitely open to SRs and less likely to be a nuisance here. The true focus of RP philosophy is more about helping men to become better versions of themselves and not misogynistic in nature as opponents claim so as to dismiss and denigrate out of ignorance.\n\nWhile there are definite distinctions between mgtow and RP adherents, both share similar views on many topics and my descriptions are very summary of course.  As such, I don't wish engage in disputes about my characterizations of these movements here.",
