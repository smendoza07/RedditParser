Boruto stans tell others not to compare naruto and boruto. But even if you stop comparing and see it as a completely different anime it'll still look shitty. And the most annoying part of this is boruto fans trying to argue against negetive comments by telling them to stop watching. Wtf is that. We have all the rights to criticize a shitty anime. Most of us started watching it because of the manga and then we get this shit. Of course we'll get mad. And they keeps saying it'll get better soon..... How many freaking episodes will this anime take to get better. It's already past 160 eps. \n\n\n\n\nI know that Manga is really good so please don't try to defend it by saying that Manga is good because *I'm only talking about the anime not manga*\n\n\nEdit: people who are saying that even manga is not that great....in my opinion the manga is pretty decent. There are very few animes which can be compared to a masterpiece like naruto. So if you compare boruto to naruto you'll obviously get disappointed. But if you see it as a completely different Manga it's pretty good. Atleast compared to the anime with the lame talk no jutsu of boruto.",

There\u2019s definitely some unspoken agreement going on with Jump.\n\nSasuke though - 100% he dies sometime in the series, but I don\u2019t think anytime soon. He\u2019s Boruto\u2019s de facto father at this point and also his Jiraiya figure. The final nail in the coffin is the fact that his death is needed to amp Sarada\u2019s powers into MS and EMS, possibly even the Rinnegan? Also the cape and sword Boruto wears in the prologue are Sasuke\u2019s.\n\nBut the most important factor of all is they know that these two are 99% of the reason Boruto is keeping its anime and manga audience around. They know how big the fan backlash would be if any one of them were to die. So until a couple more years when they\u2019ve (hopefully) made us give a sliver of a fuck about Boruto (the character)\u2019s safety above Ramen Guy\u2019s I wouldn\u2019t worry about NaruSasu.",
