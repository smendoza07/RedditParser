Many teachers hand study guides, so it's not cheating in any way, and teachers even use it to help students. \n\n\n\n\n\n2. The guy made it way bigger that it is, involving the dean and many others and making a team work non-stop for 92 hours to make a new exam. Which if he wasn't lazy should have made them do at the beginning of the year so they would have time to make a midterm and final, rather than working around the clock at the last minute because he was too lazy and opted to use the same exam for however many years (with a random picker to pick 50 questions out of the question bank). \n\n\n\n\n3. Forcing students to take the test again in a limited period and not allowing any way out. If you're a college student, your schedule is limited as hell. Especially since this is a mid term meaning that most of them had to deal with other midterms or essays that counts as their midterm. \n\n\n\n\n\n4. We were talking about how one student fucks over a whole class. The professor wouldn't have known if a student didn't drop off the quizlet answers. \n\n\n\n\n\n5. \"offered a solution which does not even punish those who participated.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe had no way of knowing who participated unless they confess (which is why he said if they did they would have to take an ethics class and be forgiven) or for someone to bring proof against another student (which would be a s/he said s/he said argument). Also, he punished everyone, not just those suspected. Most students cram materials the day before which takes a lot of time and effort. In this case, the \"cheating\" students crammed 600 questions. The ones that didn't read the guide probably made their own guide which took even more time. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. If you watched the video you would see that he is making claims that no sane person would believe. It's the same as an online multiplayer player saying he is tracking your location to punish you for beating him. There wasn't any investigation going around and they don't have suspects that he won't disclose to them but knows it's them with a 95% accuracy, but he is given them a chance. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. That is not Naruto punishing Boruto for using a ninja tool. That's the third punishing everyone in the first part of the chunin exam because someone said some students learned about their opponents before the second and third part (Kabuto showing his ninja info cards to the konoha genins).",

It's not his warmongering nature that was bad, the contrary actually. I love his lust for war. But Kishimoto trying to write how Madara desired peace and just went about the wrong way of doing it was just dumb.\n\nMadara's lust for war and battle is number 1 in the series (technically second compared to Gaara's formal bloodlust). So him wanting to cast Infinite Tsukuyomi to create peace doesn't make any sense considering how he physically can't resist the urge to fight. It's a contradiction that can't be forced to work.",

Many teachers hand study guides, so it's not cheating in any way, and teachers even use it to help students. \n\n\n\n\n\n2. The guy made it way bigger that it is, involving the dean and many others and making a team work non-stop for 92 hours to make a new exam. Which if he wasn't lazy should have made them do at the beginning of the year so they would have time to make a midterm and final, rather than working around the clock at the last minute because he was too lazy and opted to use the same exam for however many years (with a random picker to pick 50 questions out of the question bank). \n\n\n\n\n3. Forcing students to take the test again in a limited period and not allowing any way out. If you're a college student, your schedule is limited as hell. Especially since this is a mid term meaning that most of them had to deal with other midterms or essays that counts as their midterm. \n\n\n\n\n\n4. We were talking about how one student fucks over a whole class. The professor wouldn't have known if a student didn't drop off the quizlet answers. \n\n\n\n\n\n5. \"offered a solution which does not even punish those who participated.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe had no way of knowing who participated unless they confess (which is why he said if they did they would have to take an ethics class and be forgiven) or for someone to bring proof against another student (which would be a s/he said s/he said argument). Also, he punished everyone, not just those suspected. Most students cram materials the day before which takes a lot of time and effort. In this case, the \"cheating\" students crammed 600 questions. The ones that didn't read the guide probably made their own guide which took even more time. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. If you watched the video you would see that he is making claims that no sane person would believe. It's the same as an online multiplayer player saying he is tracking your location to punish you for beating him. There wasn't any investigation going around and they don't have suspects that he won't disclose to them but knows it's them with a 95% accuracy, but he is given them a chance. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. That is not Naruto punishing Boruto for using a ninja tool. That's the third punishing everyone in the first part of the chunin exam because someone said some students learned about their opponents before the second and third part (Kabuto showing his ninja info cards to the konoha genins).",

It's not his warmongering nature that was bad, the contrary actually. I love his lust for war.

So him wanting to cast Infinite Tsukuyomi to create peace doesn't make any sense considering how he physically can't resist the urge to fight. It's a contradiction that can't be forced to work.",

Many teachers hand study guides, so it's not cheating in any way, and teachers even use it to help students. \n\n\n\n\n\n2. The guy made it way bigger that it is, involving the dean and many others and making a team work non-stop for 92 hours to make a new exam. Which if he wasn't lazy should have made them do at the beginning of the year so they would have time to make a midterm and final, rather than working around the clock at the last minute because he was too lazy and opted to use the same exam for however many years (with a random picker to pick 50 questions out of the question bank). \n\n\n\n\n3. Forcing students to take the test again in a limited period and not allowing any way out. If you're a college student, your schedule is limited as hell. Especially since this is a mid term meaning that most of them had to deal with other midterms or essays that counts as their midterm. \n\n\n\n\n\n4. We were talking about how one student fucks over a whole class. The professor wouldn't have known if a student didn't drop off the quizlet answers. \n\n\n\n\n\n5. \"offered a solution which does not even punish those who participated.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe had no way of knowing who participated unless they confess (which is why he said if they did they would have to take an ethics class and be forgiven) or for someone to bring proof against another student (which would be a s/he said s/he said argument). Also, he punished everyone, not just those suspected. Most students cram materials the day before which takes a lot of time and effort. In this case, the \"cheating\" students crammed 600 questions. The ones that didn't read the guide probably made their own guide which took even more time. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. If you watched the video you would see that he is making claims that no sane person would believe. It's the same as an online multiplayer player saying he is tracking your location to punish you for beating him. There wasn't any investigation going around and they don't have suspects that he won't disclose to them but knows it's them with a 95% accuracy, but he is given them a chance. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. That is not Naruto punishing Boruto for using a ninja tool. That's the third punishing everyone in the first part of the chunin exam because someone said some students learned about their opponents before the second and third part (Kabuto showing his ninja info cards to the konoha genins).",

It's not his warmongering nature that was bad, the contrary actually. I love his lust for war.

So him wanting to cast Infinite Tsukuyomi to create peace doesn't make any sense considering how he physically can't resist the urge to fight. It's a contradiction that can't be forced to work.",

Many teachers hand study guides, so it's not cheating in any way, and teachers even use it to help students. \n\n\n\n\n\n2. The guy made it way bigger that it is, involving the dean and many others and making a team work non-stop for 92 hours to make a new exam. Which if he wasn't lazy should have made them do at the beginning of the year so they would have time to make a midterm and final, rather than working around the clock at the last minute because he was too lazy and opted to use the same exam for however many years (with a random picker to pick 50 questions out of the question bank). \n\n\n\n\n3. Forcing students to take the test again in a limited period and not allowing any way out. If you're a college student, your schedule is limited as hell. Especially since this is a mid term meaning that most of them had to deal with other midterms or essays that counts as their midterm. \n\n\n\n\n\n4. We were talking about how one student fucks over a whole class. The professor wouldn't have known if a student didn't drop off the quizlet answers. \n\n\n\n\n\n5. \"offered a solution which does not even punish those who participated.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe had no way of knowing who participated unless they confess (which is why he said if they did they would have to take an ethics class and be forgiven) or for someone to bring proof against another student (which would be a s/he said s/he said argument). Also, he punished everyone, not just those suspected. Most students cram materials the day before which takes a lot of time and effort. In this case, the \"cheating\" students crammed 600 questions. The ones that didn't read the guide probably made their own guide which took even more time. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. If you watched the video you would see that he is making claims that no sane person would believe. It's the same as an online multiplayer player saying he is tracking your location to punish you for beating him. There wasn't any investigation going around and they don't have suspects that he won't disclose to them but knows it's them with a 95% accuracy, but he is given them a chance. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. That is not Naruto punishing Boruto for using a ninja tool. That's the third punishing everyone in the first part of the chunin exam because someone said some students learned about their opponents before the second and third part (Kabuto showing his ninja info cards to the konoha genins).",

It's not his warmongering nature that was bad, the contrary actually. I love his lust for war. But Kishimoto trying to write how Madara desired peace and just went about the wrong way of doing it was just dumb.\n\nMadara's lust for war and battle is number 1 in the series (technically second compared to Gaara's formal bloodlust). So him wanting to cast Infinite Tsukuyomi to create peace doesn't make any sense considering how he physically can't resist the urge to fight. It's a contradiction that can't be forced to work.",
