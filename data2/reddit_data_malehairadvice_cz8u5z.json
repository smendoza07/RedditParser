I think face shape definitely has a large role in how good long hair looks on men, but I think haircare is way more important. I've always had really coarse, poofy short hair and I've found that Just adding a hair care routine will do wonders. Maybe I'm wrong but I think if us men take care of our hair with the proper products, a ton of guys will look great with long hair!\n\nEdit: I should mention that i've been growing my hair out for the first time since middle school and I actually really like it. I've gotten way more complements on it that I thought I would and I think it's almost exclusively the fact i've been taking better care of my hair.",
