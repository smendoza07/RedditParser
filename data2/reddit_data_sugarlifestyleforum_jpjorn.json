    "body": "I've enjoyed reading so many of the posts about great SD experiences and I'm finally happy to share mine....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo today my SD and I had our first intimate date. We've been talking for about a month now and this is only the second time we've met up in person but we talk every day and talk on the phone almost every day. We met at a nice hotel today and earlier before we met we were flirting and I told him that I was \"Meeting a guy today (which was obviously him) and was excited to see where things would go\" He then replied by telling me that the guy I am going out with would probably like to know what drink(s) I would like and I told him my current favorite is barefoot Moscato but I told him I thought it would be sweet if the guy also surprised me with another flavor I haven't tried yet like peach... \n\nAfter our little playful discussion I was excited but also a bit nervous getting ready for our date... nervous that it would just be a quickie for him or that he wouldn't really care/put a lot of effort but boy was I pleasantly surprised...\n\nI walked into the hotel room... to a low, candle-lit room with 6 types of Moscato on the counter (because he had ordered a suite for us) and two wine glasses sitting on the edge of the table. I was so shocked! I didn't expect him to buy all of the flavors for me. As soon as I came in he told me he had my \"key\" for me which was the PPM and we sat down and he poured me a glass of wine. We danced to some music because he had his laptop and we watched a few of our favorite artists' music videos (random lol but he was just trying to be chill about everything) and then we moved into the bedroom. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe bedroom was filled with about 10-15 candles spread throughout the room with the same low-lights as the other room and I was once again shocked!! We climbed into bed and started kissing and then things progressed... and by progress I mean really progressed! I expected him to immediately ask him for a blowjob/put on a condom but instead he was just kissing my neck and up and down my body and then moved on to eating me out (which I found out after a few minutes of him doing it that it was something he loved to do even more than the \"penetration\" part of sex) and he told me that he wanted to get me to orgasm and he wouldn't stop until I did (in a nice way of course) long story short he got me to orgasm around 4-5 times which was another shock!! His medication made it difficult for him to perform so he just pleased me the majority of the night but he told me he didn't mind and actually preferred it that way. After we finished we cuddled and he asked me if I liked toys and he said he would like to try some on me (also another shock--idk I feel like some men feel like they themselves are enough to please you lol!!)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just feel so blessed to find a SD like this. This is my first official sugar RS and I wasn't expecting a  man like this at all. I feel like I'm very lucky to find a man that not only is a financial provider but also a provider sensually/sexually in the bedroom to his woman ;) I'm so excited to see where things go.... he's such a romantic! If anyone has any thoughts or similar experiences feel free to comment below. I'd love to hear stories!",
