    "body": "TLDR:::: This naughty school girl was able to spoil her SD after being spoiled with a bag full of happy Halloween gifts \ud83c\udf83\n\nMy(27F) very sweet SD(39M) and I spent the day together this past weekend on Halloween. Our local area is still heavily locked down for Covid so not much Halloween fun to   be had. Fortunately, my SD got creative and brought me a costume to our date.\n\nHe hands me a gift bag. My heart swells. Gift giving is my top love language, even tiny little trinkets, as long as you were thinking of me. Here in front of me, was a bag full of \"he really listens to what I have to say.\" \n\nMy dog's birthday is the day after Halloween. He got my dog a birthday present \ud83d\ude2d\ud83c\udf81. My dog and my SD have a wonderful relationship lol not even kidding. \n\nInside the bag was a beverage item he knows I love. He picked it up before I said I needed a refill.\n\nInside the bag was my monthly allowance. This generous man has never 'forgotten' to give my allowance, always on time or early. I know I am blessed to have him and recieve his kindness. \n\nThe intimacy was electric. The cuddles were rejuvenating. \ud83d\ude18",
