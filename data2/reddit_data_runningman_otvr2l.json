It was more obvious in the yotube video with Jong Kook where she appeared without make up. All the CF shoots and magazine covers are heavily photoshopped. I have never put JH on a pedestal because of her prettiness. She is pretty, but her beauty is overhyped. Also, fans are never ready to accept that aging has caught up with her. \n\nOn the other hand, I give credit to her for showing up with bare face even when it is puffed and the age lines are showing in such a lookist society. That takes guts. Aging is normal and it is good to embrace it.",
