Hiruzen had old age restrictions but still took Orochimaru\u2019s jutsu for a while. Tsuande protected some of the villagers from Pain\u2019s Beirut blast but Tsunade isn\u2019t that strong compared to other Hokage. Kakashi did all the cool stuff when he wasn\u2019t Hokage. Still one of the strongest Lead ninja of all time. War arc Kakashi and DMS Kakashi were honestly scary\n\nEdit: I\u2019m joking about half of this. Hiruzen in prime would be insanely strong. Tobirama is OP as hell. But Minato, Naruto, and Hashirama were even more OP imo. They basically never lost. Naruto usually needs teammates but he also fights people that are usually stronger than him at the time of the fight. Unless he gets an insane power up. Which he usually does",

We've seen many characters get heavily wounded in fights that they won like Sasuke vs Danzo or Killer Bee or Deidara, Orochimaru vs Hiruzen, Naruto vs Pain, etc. It's not an antifeat to say that he was badly wounded in an ambush at a piece summit.",

The second confrontation was Ginkaku vs Kinkaku when they were alive and not weakened by edotensei and had 18 or 20 elite ninja as backup, which I guarantee Darui wouldn't survive against.\n\nSo Ino, Shikamaru, Choji, and all those other fodder ninja are also stronger than them too? Darui only won because he had tons of support and bad writing let them get sealed away. Sealing someone away also doesn't mean they're stronger. Is Sai stronger than Madara? He was about to seal him before Zetsu revived him, so, by your logic, Sai is on Madara's level.",

Tsuande protected some of the villagers from Pain\u2019s Beirut blast but Tsunade isn\u2019t that strong compared to other Hokage. Kakashi did all the cool stuff when he wasn\u2019t Hokage. Still one of the strongest Lead ninja of all time. War arc Kakashi and DMS Kakashi were honestly scary\n\nEdit: I\u2019m joking about half of this. Hiruzen in prime would be insanely strong. Tobirama is OP as hell. But Minato, Naruto, and Hashirama were even more OP imo. They basically never lost. Naruto usually needs teammates but he also fights people that are usually stronger than him at the time of the fight. Unless he gets an insane power up. Which he usually does",

We've seen many characters get heavily wounded in fights that they won like Sasuke vs Danzo or Killer Bee or Deidara, Orochimaru vs Hiruzen, Naruto vs Pain, etc. It's not an antifeat to say that he was badly wounded in an ambush at a piece summit.",

The second confrontation was Ginkaku vs Kinkaku when they were alive and not weakened by edotensei and had 18 or 20 elite ninja as backup, which I guarantee Darui wouldn't survive against.\n\nSo Ino, Shikamaru, Choji, and all those other fodder ninja are also stronger than them too? Darui only won because he had tons of support and bad writing let them get sealed away. Sealing someone away also doesn't mean they're stronger. Is Sai stronger than Madara? He was about to seal him before Zetsu revived him, so, by your logic, Sai is on Madara's level.",

Honestly he\u2019s very similar to The Flash, the only way he should lose is by jobbing. Minato lacks large-scale destructive power but he can stay alive and take out single targets no problem. He probably can\u2019t break through a susano\u2019o but Itachi couldn\u2019t tag him. As long as Minato knows to steer clear of getting caught in genjutsu I think he can outlast Itachi and win by attrition",

While the only thing Jiraya has going for him is fighting and beating 3 paths of pain (arguably 3 of the weakest in battle).

Tsuande protected some of the villagers from Pain\u2019s Beirut blast but Tsunade isn\u2019t that strong compared to other Hokage. Kakashi did all the cool stuff when he wasn\u2019t Hokage. Still one of the strongest Lead ninja of all time. War arc Kakashi and DMS Kakashi were honestly scary\n\nEdit: I\u2019m joking about half of this. Hiruzen in prime would be insanely strong. Tobirama is OP as hell. But Minato, Naruto, and Hashirama were even more OP imo. They basically never lost. Naruto usually needs teammates but he also fights people that are usually stronger than him at the time of the fight. Unless he gets an insane power up. Which he usually does",

The second confrontation was Ginkaku vs Kinkaku when they were alive and not weakened by edotensei and had 18 or 20 elite ninja as backup, which I guarantee Darui wouldn't survive against.\n\nSo Ino, Shikamaru, Choji, and all those other fodder ninja are also stronger than them too? Darui only won because he had tons of support and bad writing let them get sealed away. Sealing someone away also doesn't mean they're stronger. Is Sai stronger than Madara?

Much less biased statements, from a double agent character, that make no sense based on what we see from said characters in future arcs. Hiruzen is said to be the strongest kage and master all jutsu. Clearly not true, and so isn't Jiraya being stronger than both Itachi and Kisame together. Do you realize how incoherent that is based on what these characters do onwards?",

Also his 7 Gates form is on par with Kisame/Bijuu. Man is nuts.\n\nMeanwhile Itachi could only use the Susanoo when he had infinite chakra from being reanimated. Boi is hax one on one but only if the person going against him looks right at him/doesn't have a hax of their own. Gai/Madara/Jiriaya would all be unaffected by him.",

The second confrontation was Ginkaku vs Kinkaku when they were alive and not weakened by edotensei and had 18 or 20 elite ninja as backup, which I guarantee Darui wouldn't survive against.\n\nSo Ino, Shikamaru, Choji, and all those other fodder ninja are also stronger than them too? Darui only won because he had tons of support and bad writing let them get sealed away. Sealing someone away also doesn't mean they're stronger. Is Sai stronger than Madara? He was about to seal him before Zetsu revived him, so, by your logic, Sai is on Madara's level.",

While the only thing Jiraya has going for him is fighting and beating 3 paths of pain (arguably 3 of the weakest in battle).

The second confrontation was Ginkaku vs Kinkaku when they were alive and not weakened by edotensei and had 18 or 20 elite ninja as backup, which I guarantee Darui wouldn't survive against.\n\nSo Ino, Shikamaru, Choji, and all those other fodder ninja are also stronger than them too? Darui only won because he had tons of support and bad writing let them get sealed away. Sealing someone away also doesn't mean they're stronger. Is Sai stronger than Madara? He was about to seal him before Zetsu revived him, so, by your logic, Sai is on Madara's level.",

While the only thing Jiraya has going for him is fighting and beating 3 paths of pain (arguably 3 of the weakest in battle).

We've seen many characters get heavily wounded in fights that they won like Sasuke vs Danzo or Killer Bee or Deidara, Orochimaru vs Hiruzen, Naruto vs Pain, etc. It's not an antifeat to say that he was badly wounded in an ambush at a piece summit.",

The second confrontation was Ginkaku vs Kinkaku when they were alive and not weakened by edotensei and had 18 or 20 elite ninja as backup, which I guarantee Darui wouldn't survive against.\n\nSo Ino, Shikamaru, Choji, and all those other fodder ninja are also stronger than them too? Darui only won because he had tons of support and bad writing let them get sealed away. Sealing someone away also doesn't mean they're stronger. Is Sai stronger than Madara? He was about to seal him before Zetsu revived him, so, by your logic, Sai is on Madara's level.",

While the only thing Jiraya has going for him is fighting and beating 3 paths of pain (arguably 3 of the weakest in battle).

Darui only won because he had tons of support and bad writing let them get sealed away. Sealing someone away also doesn't mean they're stronger. Is Sai stronger than Madara?

In fact I believe he is much closer in speed, albeit faster, to Curse mode sasuke who was outrun by the amaterasu. Also plot wise, main characters cant get hit by amaterasu, cause they would die. \nItachi also has kotohamatsukami anothe KO ability\nEdit: spelling",
