            "body": "Ik most people see this as just \"haha sasuke got bodied bad\" moment but i believe that him getting punched around so easily during this fight was quite integral in developing his character and abilities for the next part of the series bc if he hadn't learnt a lesson through this fight the 5 kage summit would have gone much more disastrous for him \n \nI wont exactly call his behaviour after itachi's death \"arrogant\" since obito had straight up told him that itachi was letting sasuke win but he definitely believed that if he could go toe to toe against itachi (who he thought was strongest in the world) he could defeat anyone which proved to be false during this fight\n\nIf sasuke had gone to the 5 kage summit with the same level of confidence as he did during the killer B fight he wouldn't have made it past his fight with raikage+gaara since his abilities would be rusty and he wouldn't have prioritized finding danzo",

So he had both Hashirama's and his own power when he fights the 5 kage. When Hashirama beat him he just had his Mangekyou and no Hashirama cells.

Especially all naruto was reincarnation of a hard worker and a dunce. Sage of the Sixth Path literally said just because your parent are talented doesn't mean your offspring will inherited either of those parent talented. It meant to show sometime you can be underdog even if you are born with extradionary circumstances\n\n\n>it seems less like you have valid reasons and more like you have something against sasuke to make these claims\n\nNo shit. Most people who loved this fight hate Sasuke attitude. That is why they have something against him. You want a medal for that deduction Sherlock? There is nothing wrong of disliking fictional character. If you like Sasuke cool. A lot of people don't and we like to express it. If you dont like our opinion get off the internet. \n\nJust because he has few moment acknowledging his opponent doesn't change the fact 90% of the times he act arrogant. In this fight he literally told his team TAKA he handle bee himself and completely underestimate his opponent act like he worth nothing.",

            "body": "Even though i agree Killer Bee was indesputably stronger, I'd like to point out something people, understandably, often disregard (especially in Naruto powerscaling). That is that most times, the course of the fight is defined by what would progress the development of the story and characters the most. So if someone loses, he's not necessarily weaker at that point, or atleast not to that extent. Examples: Lee fucking up Sasuke before the Chunin Exams, Gaara obliterating Dosu on the roof before the final tournamen, Kabuto fucking Tsunade up, Sasori losing to Sakura, Kakuzu getting oneshotted by Naruto, Shisui getting his eye stolen by an edgy grandpa with serious mental issues, Pain shitting on the entirity of the leaf village, and many more. \n\nIn this case, as I said before, Bee was obviously stronger. Would be dumb if he wasn't. That does not athough change the fact Sasuke needed to go through that for his personal character development. I personally believe he could, if he wasn't exhausted and worked with his entire team, probably put up a good fight, and possibly even actually win. But that would make 0 sense plot-wise and so I'm glad he didn't. Plot is, and always will be, the first concern when it comes to progressinig the story, sometimes logic outcomes suffer under that and I feel like people completely refrain from ever taking that into consideration.\n\nThat's my main complaint I have with Naruto's powerscaling 'community'.",

He also 1shot Naruto who a few weeks later beat Shukaku so idk. \n\n>Gaara killing Dosu was logical, a jinchuriki (even before we got base theory on them) is stronger than an ordinary genin shinobi.\n\nIt may just be have been my bias, since I loved dosu and hated how he hot shafted basically offscreen. I just found it dumb that he got bodied in mere seconds after he had been such an interesting and strong antagonist (he shat on Lee, who shat on Naruto, so yeah)\n\n>Pain obliterating a village is what you expect from the strongest villain (atm) and a Ninja god powers (Orochimaru almost did it in the first series if it wasn\u2019t for Jiraiya without being as strong as Pain).\n\nAgreed but I'm saying there are multiple near kage level shinobi (including two Hokage) plus all of the konoha 11 and the Anbu. The fact that all of that is apparently not even nearly as strong as Sage mode Naruto is a bit depressing. \n\n>Kabuto beat up Tsinade because she wasn\u2019t mentally ready to fight (as well as the several-years-to-be-snake-man was strong himself). So it was a plot fight. Same with Kakuzu\n\nI mean I liked pt 1 Kabuto so I don't mind him having a moment, but he was compared to Kakashi who in pt 1 kinda sucked (I'm comparison to some others) while Tsunade was someone even Orochimaru expressed fear about. Then suddenly that weird kid with medical training and a deck of Yugi Yo cards starts fucking her up. Kinda made Tsunade feel weak imo but idk. \n\n\n>Can\u2019t remember Shisui and Sasori but wasn\u2019t the latter de facto defeated by the sand village elder lady using Sakura as a weapon?\n\nYes and also I think kishimoto stated how Sasori apparently even let them win so that just proves how they won purely for the sake of plot..",

Things that would make little sense in terms of scaling for example. \n\nAlso o really love Naruto and everything kishimoto gave us and I love the writing but it has its flaws. Fatigue f.e. is something you mentioned, which kishimoto loves to disregard. Remember the 2day nonstop fight Naruto and Sasuke had against the tentails, Madara, Obito and kaguya. Directly after they had another massive fight against each other in which they went all out AGAIN. The sad reality is that people (including me) think more about scaling and who is stronger than who than kishimoto probably did at some points, which I absolutely understand and don't get me wrong I don't mind it that much. He had to write a chapter per week and obviously if I was writing a story I wouldn't have a tier list of strongest characters on a wall or something so I totally get it.\nThis is not a critisism of his work but rather how er interpret too much out of simple stuff.",

And Sarutobi beat Hashirama *and* his brother at the same time? Which is why it has to be retconned that Hashi wasn't able to use his full strength in that fight. \n\nThe power scaling just got completely out of control.",

When he fought Hashirama he didn't have the Rinnegan. And when he did have the Rinnegan, he was so old and frail. \n\n\nKabuto reanimated him with both a youthful body and the Rinnegan, and IIRC gave him extra Hashirama cells. So he had both Hashirama's and his own power when he fights the 5 kage. When Hashirama beat him he just had his Mangekyou and no Hashirama cells. So there's a huge power difference between Madara in his own time and reanimated hacks Madara.",

Especially all naruto was reincarnation of a hard worker and a dunce. Sage of the Sixth Path literally said just because your parent are talented doesn't mean your offspring will inherited either of those parent talented. It meant to show sometime you can be underdog even if you are born with extradionary circumstances\n\n\n>it seems less like you have valid reasons and more like you have something against sasuke to make these claims\n\nNo shit. Most people who loved this fight hate Sasuke attitude. That is why they have something against him. You want a medal for that deduction Sherlock? There is nothing wrong of disliking fictional character. If you like Sasuke cool. A lot of people don't and we like to express it. If you dont like our opinion get off the internet. \n\nJust because he has few moment acknowledging his opponent doesn't change the fact 90% of the times he act arrogant. In this fight he literally told his team TAKA he handle bee himself and completely underestimate his opponent act like he worth nothing.",

He also 1shot Naruto who a few weeks later beat Shukaku so idk. \n\n>Gaara killing Dosu was logical, a jinchuriki (even before we got base theory on them) is stronger than an ordinary genin shinobi.\n\nIt may just be have been my bias, since I loved dosu and hated how he hot shafted basically offscreen. I just found it dumb that he got bodied in mere seconds after he had been such an interesting and strong antagonist (he shat on Lee, who shat on Naruto, so yeah)\n\n>Pain obliterating a village is what you expect from the strongest villain (atm) and a Ninja god powers (Orochimaru almost did it in the first series if it wasn\u2019t for Jiraiya without being as strong as Pain).\n\nAgreed but I'm saying there are multiple near kage level shinobi (including two Hokage) plus all of the konoha 11 and the Anbu. The fact that all of that is apparently not even nearly as strong as Sage mode Naruto is a bit depressing. \n\n>Kabuto beat up Tsinade because she wasn\u2019t mentally ready to fight (as well as the several-years-to-be-snake-man was strong himself). So it was a plot fight. Same with Kakuzu\n\nI mean I liked pt 1 Kabuto so I don't mind him having a moment, but he was compared to Kakashi who in pt 1 kinda sucked (I'm comparison to some others) while Tsunade was someone even Orochimaru expressed fear about. Then suddenly that weird kid with medical training and a deck of Yugi Yo cards starts fucking her up. Kinda made Tsunade feel weak imo but idk. \n\n\n>Can\u2019t remember Shisui and Sasori but wasn\u2019t the latter de facto defeated by the sand village elder lady using Sakura as a weapon?\n\nYes and also I think kishimoto stated how Sasori apparently even let them win so that just proves how they won purely for the sake of plot..",

Things that would make little sense in terms of scaling for example. \n\nAlso o really love Naruto and everything kishimoto gave us and I love the writing but it has its flaws. Fatigue f.e. is something you mentioned, which kishimoto loves to disregard. Remember the 2day nonstop fight Naruto and Sasuke had against the tentails, Madara, Obito and kaguya. Directly after they had another massive fight against each other in which they went all out AGAIN. The sad reality is that people (including me) think more about scaling and who is stronger than who than kishimoto probably did at some points, which I absolutely understand and don't get me wrong I don't mind it that much. He had to write a chapter per week and obviously if I was writing a story I wouldn't have a tier list of strongest characters on a wall or something so I totally get it.\nThis is not a critisism of his work but rather how er interpret too much out of simple stuff.",

Especially all naruto was reincarnation of a hard worker and a dunce. Sage of the Sixth Path literally said just because your parent are talented doesn't mean your offspring will inherited either of those parent talented. It meant to show sometime you can be underdog even if you are born with extradionary circumstances\n\n\n>it seems less like you have valid reasons and more like you have something against sasuke to make these claims\n\nNo shit. Most people who loved this fight hate Sasuke attitude. That is why they have something against him. You want a medal for that deduction Sherlock? There is nothing wrong of disliking fictional character. If you like Sasuke cool. A lot of people don't and we like to express it. If you dont like our opinion get off the internet. \n\nJust because he has few moment acknowledging his opponent doesn't change the fact 90% of the times he act arrogant. In this fight he literally told his team TAKA he handle bee himself and completely underestimate his opponent act like he worth nothing.",

He also 1shot Naruto who a few weeks later beat Shukaku so idk. \n\n>Gaara killing Dosu was logical, a jinchuriki (even before we got base theory on them) is stronger than an ordinary genin shinobi.\n\nIt may just be have been my bias, since I loved dosu and hated how he hot shafted basically offscreen. I just found it dumb that he got bodied in mere seconds after he had been such an interesting and strong antagonist (he shat on Lee, who shat on Naruto, so yeah)\n\n>Pain obliterating a village is what you expect from the strongest villain (atm) and a Ninja god powers (Orochimaru almost did it in the first series if it wasn\u2019t for Jiraiya without being as strong as Pain).\n\nAgreed but I'm saying there are multiple near kage level shinobi (including two Hokage) plus all of the konoha 11 and the Anbu. The fact that all of that is apparently not even nearly as strong as Sage mode Naruto is a bit depressing. \n\n>Kabuto beat up Tsinade because she wasn\u2019t mentally ready to fight (as well as the several-years-to-be-snake-man was strong himself). So it was a plot fight. Same with Kakuzu\n\nI mean I liked pt 1 Kabuto so I don't mind him having a moment, but he was compared to Kakashi who in pt 1 kinda sucked (I'm comparison to some others) while Tsunade was someone even Orochimaru expressed fear about. Then suddenly that weird kid with medical training and a deck of Yugi Yo cards starts fucking her up. Kinda made Tsunade feel weak imo but idk. \n\n\n>Can\u2019t remember Shisui and Sasori but wasn\u2019t the latter de facto defeated by the sand village elder lady using Sakura as a weapon?\n\nYes and also I think kishimoto stated how Sasori apparently even let them win so that just proves how they won purely for the sake of plot..",

Things that would make little sense in terms of scaling for example. \n\nAlso o really love Naruto and everything kishimoto gave us and I love the writing but it has its flaws. Fatigue f.e. is something you mentioned, which kishimoto loves to disregard. Remember the 2day nonstop fight Naruto and Sasuke had against the tentails, Madara, Obito and kaguya. Directly after they had another massive fight against each other in which they went all out AGAIN. The sad reality is that people (including me) think more about scaling and who is stronger than who than kishimoto probably did at some points, which I absolutely understand and don't get me wrong I don't mind it that much. He had to write a chapter per week and obviously if I was writing a story I wouldn't have a tier list of strongest characters on a wall or something so I totally get it.\nThis is not a critisism of his work but rather how er interpret too much out of simple stuff.",

Especially all naruto was reincarnation of a hard worker and a dunce. Sage of the Sixth Path literally said just because your parent are talented doesn't mean your offspring will inherited either of those parent talented. It meant to show sometime you can be underdog even if you are born with extradionary circumstances\n\n\n>it seems less like you have valid reasons and more like you have something against sasuke to make these claims\n\nNo shit. Most people who loved this fight hate Sasuke attitude. That is why they have something against him. You want a medal for that deduction Sherlock? There is nothing wrong of disliking fictional character. If you like Sasuke cool. A lot of people don't and we like to express it. If you dont like our opinion get off the internet. \n\nJust because he has few moment acknowledging his opponent doesn't change the fact 90% of the times he act arrogant. In this fight he literally told his team TAKA he handle bee himself and completely underestimate his opponent act like he worth nothing.",

Especially all naruto was reincarnation of a hard worker and a dunce. Sage of the Sixth Path literally said just because your parent are talented doesn't mean your offspring will inherited either of those parent talented. It meant to show sometime you can be underdog even if you are born with extradionary circumstances\n\n\n>it seems less like you have valid reasons and more like you have something against sasuke to make these claims\n\nNo shit. Most people who loved this fight hate Sasuke attitude. That is why they have something against him. You want a medal for that deduction Sherlock? There is nothing wrong of disliking fictional character. If you like Sasuke cool. A lot of people don't and we like to express it. If you dont like our opinion get off the internet. \n\nJust because he has few moment acknowledging his opponent doesn't change the fact 90% of the times he act arrogant. In this fight he literally told his team TAKA he handle bee himself and completely underestimate his opponent act like he worth nothing.",

Especially all naruto was reincarnation of a hard worker and a dunce. Sage of the Sixth Path literally said just because your parent are talented doesn't mean your offspring will inherited either of those parent talented. It meant to show sometime you can be underdog even if you are born with extradionary circumstances\n\n\n>it seems less like you have valid reasons and more like you have something against sasuke to make these claims\n\nNo shit. Most people who loved this fight hate Sasuke attitude. That is why they have something against him. You want a medal for that deduction Sherlock? There is nothing wrong of disliking fictional character. If you like Sasuke cool. A lot of people don't and we like to express it. If you dont like our opinion get off the internet. \n\nJust because he has few moment acknowledging his opponent doesn't change the fact 90% of the times he act arrogant. In this fight he literally told his team TAKA he handle bee himself and completely underestimate his opponent act like he worth nothing.",

Especially all naruto was reincarnation of a hard worker and a dunce. Sage of the Sixth Path literally said just because your parent are talented doesn't mean your offspring will inherited either of those parent talented. It meant to show sometime you can be underdog even if you are born with extradionary circumstances\n\n\n>it seems less like you have valid reasons and more like you have something against sasuke to make these claims\n\nNo shit. Most people who loved this fight hate Sasuke attitude. That is why they have something against him. You want a medal for that deduction Sherlock? There is nothing wrong of disliking fictional character. If you like Sasuke cool. A lot of people don't and we like to express it. If you dont like our opinion get off the internet. \n\nJust because he has few moment acknowledging his opponent doesn't change the fact 90% of the times he act arrogant.
