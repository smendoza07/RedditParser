    "body": "Just wanted to share some tips, since I\u2019ve been using Tinder for a while now and I\u2019ve managed to have a few different types of arrangements from it over the past year.\n\nFirst of all I wanted to clarify that Tinder isn\u2019t a vanilla dating app, it\u2019s a dating app. Nowhere in the terms of use does it say anything about the type of dating that is allowed. What is not allowed on tinder is soliciting and prostitution, that\u2019s also the case on Seeking Arrangements. Apart from that, people of all ages (legal) and orientations are allowed to use tinder for all kinds of relationships: FWB, platonic, hookups, sugar, bdsm, polyamory, long term, future spouse etc. \n\nHowever if multiple people get offended and report your account, it will get banned for sure, no questions asked. You will never be able to use the same phone number to create a new tinder account, and you will lose all your matches and conversations. Tinder will not reveal the reason why your account was banned (they don\u2019t investigate) and you will not be able to appeal. [Bitter guys go on reporting rampages against girls who have their IG in their bio](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tinder/comments/ehzc88/today_i_started_reporting_any_profile_with_just/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), so you can imagine the hate gold diggers/ sugar babies get.\n\nHere are a few tips to make the experience easier:\n\n- Use a burner number to create your profile (Google Voice or Hushed depending on your location)\n\n- Do not link your Instagram to your tinder account. If you want to, mention your handle in your bio. If your account gets banned, your linked Instagram will be flagged too and you\u2019ll have issues next time you create an account. \n\n- Do not use any terms in your bio or messages that can be associated with illegal activities. Avoid \u201cmutually beneficial\u201d \u201carrangement\u201d \u201callowance\u201d etc.\n\n- Instead describe the kind of man you want (\u201cgenerous\u201d \u201cfinancially stable\u201d) and the type of relationship you are looking for. I like to mention expensive activities we could do together, just to make sure they get the message. \n\n- If you can, choose pictures that make you look more $B rather than girl next door. Considering this isn\u2019t SA, you have to market yourself differently. I include pictures on luxury holidays, on a yacht, at high-end events etc. That\u2019s not my everyday lifestyle but it helps weed out splenda/ salt daddies and men who do not want to spend. \n\n- Avoid swiping right on people if you\u2019re not sure they are into sugar dating. I recommend investing in Tinder Gold to see who has liked you and selecting your matches from there. Otherwise focus on the men who superliked you, that indicates that they probably know what you\u2019re looking for and they are OK with it (or they might just want to make sure they can talk to you to insult you, you know how it is).\n\n- When you get a match and start talking, try and switch to a different messaging platform ASAP. Some men will know what you want, some will think you\u2019re an escort and will try to get your rates, some men will just want to pass time out of curiosity with no intention of pursuing anything. Do not clarify anything in tinder chat.\n\n- As soon as you start talking on another platform, unmatch from tinder. That way if they get offended by the fact that you\u2019re a SB, they won\u2019t be able to report you. (Don\u2019t forget to take screenshots of the profile before to have their bio and pictures in case you decide to meet). \n\nOn SA you have a pool of men supposedly looking for the same thing as you are, and you need to approach a large number of them. On Tinder it\u2019s the opposite, you need to focus on the few men who look like they might be into sugar dating. \n\nAn extra benefit of tinder (if you\u2019re into that), is that you can date young and handsome experience daddies. Athletes, entrepreneurs, traders etc. who will take you out on luxury dates, buy you gifts, and give you a good time in a way that feels natural. Usually it\u2019s casual and it doesn\u2019t last long, but it\u2019s fun and the wardrobe/ lifestyle upgrade helps be comfortable around a +++ POT sugar daddy.",

            "body": "I wholeheartedly agree with using Tinder alongside SA. I\u2019ve met two of my current SDs through tinder. My first sd is now my sbf and we\u2019ve been together for two years so far. My second guy I first got in contact with SA, but then he found me on tinder and liked me there too. At the time, I was seriously pursuing pots, but I got swept up in homework. Had he not reached out that second time we would not have been together. \n\n\nAside from my bio, I add this bit: \u201c\u2018Seeking\u2019 a kind, generous, supportive, and respectful person. A cross between friends and lovers (mutual/beneficial relationship).\u201d I think this helps a lot. Also I feel like common sense would dictate that if a 20-something yr old woman was reaching out to a 50+yr old man, she is looking for something other than vanilla. It is true that you will face a lot of negative reactions, but its fair to get that.",

I and figure out what I get when we start dating (of course that\u2019s riskier and it requires more screening and patience). Because of my tinder profile and the men I choose to meet, it has worked for me so far. I mentioned experience sugar too, that\u2019s because in some cases I don\u2019t even mention \u201cfinancial support\u201d. Sometimes experience sugar works better with the dynamic we have and it\u2019s still worth it imo.\n\nI think it\u2019s actually one of the reasons I like Tinder so much, arrangements aren\u2019t so formal (I give you X so you give me Y) and it feels a lot more like regular dating and less like a work obligation.",

This is using tinder to meet potential SDs for a M&G. If we don\u2019t have chemistry we never see each other again and that\u2019s the end of the story. \n\nPersonally I rarely ever discuss the terms of the arrangement, especially when we meet free-styling or on Tinder. I say what I like: the type of lifestyle, gifts, and I mention financial support. I and figure out what I get when we start dating (of course that\u2019s riskier and it requires more screening and patience). Because of my tinder profile and the men I choose to meet, it has worked for me so far. I mentioned experience sugar too, that\u2019s because in some cases I don\u2019t even mention \u201cfinancial support\u201d. Sometimes experience sugar works better with the dynamic we have and it\u2019s still worth it imo.\n\nI think it\u2019s actually one of the reasons I like Tinder so much, arrangements aren\u2019t so formal (I give you X so you give me Y) and it feels a lot more like regular dating and less like a work obligation.",

It's against soliciting money from users *at all*.",

You can always give someone your Instagram once you take your conversation off the the app.\n\nTinder would easily weed out people on there just looking for Instagram followers or those who want to rope you in one step more to some onlyfans kind of paysite.",

That doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not allowed. Tinder doesn\u2019t investigate anything. I don\u2019t know how many times I have to repeat that sugar dating doesn\u2019t go against any Tinder rule. \n\nIn my part of the world you\u2019re more likely to get banned if you\u2019re a transgender person than a sugar baby.

That doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not allowed. Tinder doesn\u2019t investigate anything. I don\u2019t know how many times I have to repeat that sugar dating doesn\u2019t go against any Tinder rule. \n\nIn my part of the world you\u2019re more likely to get banned if you\u2019re a transgender person than a sugar baby. Doesn\u2019t mean that being trans is against any tinder rule",
