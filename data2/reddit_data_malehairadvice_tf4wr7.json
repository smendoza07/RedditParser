I just think this hair the guy here has is too long and lacks a style but  there are also a lot of posts where a dude posts their long hair and everyone begs them not to cut it even though it doesn\u2019t even look great. I personally just cut some pretty long hair and I am so happy I did I look a lot better with shorter hair, (I didn\u2019t buzz the sides it was all scissor cut so it\u2019s not super short) and it just makes my face shape a whole lot better and more masculine when it\u2019s shorter",

I just think this hair the guy here has is too long and lacks a style but  there are also a lot of posts where a dude posts their long hair and everyone begs them not to cut it even though it doesn\u2019t even look great. I personally just cut some pretty long hair and I am so happy I did I look a lot better with shorter hair, (I didn\u2019t buzz the sides it was all scissor cut so it\u2019s not super short) and it just makes my face shape a whole lot better and more masculine when it\u2019s shorter",

I just think this hair the guy here has is too long and lacks a style but  there are also a lot of posts where a dude posts their long hair and everyone begs them not to cut it even though it doesn\u2019t even look great. I personally just cut some pretty long hair and I am so happy I did I look a lot better with shorter hair, (I didn\u2019t buzz the sides it was all scissor cut so it\u2019s not super short) and it just makes my face shape a whole lot better and more masculine when it\u2019s shorter",
