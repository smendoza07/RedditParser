We have to thank the members and crew for giving so much of themselves to keep the show going.\n\nThank you so much for helping us get through whatever trials and tribulations we face with your whimsical and just plain fun attitudes. I always have something to look forward to after a long week.",

I\u2019ve always prepared myself for the show to end thanks to the dramas they\u2019ve had in the past (SBS fiasco, KG and LKS leaving) but I do hope they can continue for as long as they can while still enjoying filming it. Thank you RM for 12 years of laughter!",
