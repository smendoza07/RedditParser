Remember he always told that he had someone spying akastsuki and sharing Intel. So it's my guess that it's itachi. Since hiruzen might have told jiraiya about it. So no way they would fight in the first place. And if I'm wrong then jiraiya wouldn't have starred directly into itachis eyes.",

The wat he fough against Pain without prior knowledge of how his abilites worked put's him way above them. During the show there were ninjas that were more skilled or more powerful than Jiraiya, but very few were as skilled and as poweful at the same time.",

Amaterasu was specific to him among them and he only used it as a trump card like tsukyomi as he didn't try to spam either one like Sasuke. Sage mode is somewhat known but the details aren't only that it increases chakra substantially, and Itachi would put two and two together as Jiraiya is more of an offensive fighter and he would need to halt movement to access it, though I will definitley give that one to you as that is dependent on Itachi being able to have that rumored info and ascertain the trick.

But if we do shonen rock-paper-scissors math, then if Itachi is on par with Sasuke, and Sasuke beat Orochimaru, and Orochimaru is on par with Jiraya, then that would put Itachi above Jiraya, even though that sort of rationale makes no sense.",

I know they never saw each other much but thats the same with orochimaru and jiraya. I don't see itachi and kisame beating pain. Seems like jiraya could have. Itachi is a really good all around fighter but jiraya is even more prepared for random stuff. He is like a super shikamaru with his weapons tool kit. And he just has way too many counters for both of kisame and Itachi's attacks and would understand what's going on. He would be too dangerous to keep in the water bubble, genjustu would only slightly work. He would be stronger than kisame and he would understand what Itachi is up to and what his susanoo weilds and how dangerous the susanoo is, it's even worse if they fight in Shippuden cause Itachi will die trying to fight. Based on people pointing out that Itachi could have been working with jiraiya, I don't know if Itachi thought he was stronger than jiraya, but I think that Itachi said they both would be killed if they fought just to get kisame to back off, but Itachi was underestimating jiraya there.",

Also, the strongest tailed beast is the 9 tails. They would put their strongest duo on the task of securing the strongest tailed beast. Jiraya is a bad ass, but, Itachi would have fared just as well if not better against Pain as Jiraya did.",

I always figured he found a way to discreetly hand the info to the Hokage \"anonymously\" thus why Jiraiya didn't know where alot of the info came from. \n\nItachi probably knew tendou was a puppet as he would be able to recognize the chakra receiver rods\n\nJiraiya **might** be able to take Itachi on in his, Itachi, weakened state but kisame is a while other level. Jiraiya is alot like Naruto where in he relies heavily on his chakra and spams summonings and frog themed jutsu, so with kisame its more a question of who runs out first and while Jiraiya has a near limitless supply when attached to ma and pa he can be instantly capacitated, have ma and pa knocked of him or severely wounded and kisame is the real zero tails. And sharkskin could take all his sage chakra with a glancing blow\n\nI think alot of people get this wrong when they put this fight together in their heads. The main threat to Jiraiya is kisame, not Itachi. While Itachi is mostly a small jutsu user he uses very strong, targeted attacks. Jiraiya use not as powerful but still physically devastating attacks that affect a large range and that would keep Itachi on the defensive. \n\nThe reason pain beat him is because he tried to keep him on the defensive, which is not jiraiya's strong suit. This is what kisame would do very well. \n\nItachi's best bet is to actually stay on the defensive, leading Jiraiya to think he's not all hes cracked up to be. Thus leading him to be overconfident and not use ma and pa which is his downfall. Hell drain his chakra to where he can't summon them and then Itachi strikes **hard**.\n\nThank you for coming to my Ted Talk\u2122",

Just look at the Hiruzen Vs. Orochimaru fight for further proof - you'll notice Hiruzen was *handling* the *previous* Kage, along with being *afraid* of his *successor*.\n\nKakashi *himself*, before the *retcons*, said these things:\n\n>*In this world there are kids who are younger than you, and yet... stronger than me.*\r\n\n>>***The next generation will always surpass the previous one. It's one of the never-ending cycles in life.***\n\nItachi, along with being one of the premier Shinobi of Konoha - a *highly* prodigious *genius* - was, again, \"the next generation\"; he, therefore, in my stuck-in-OG-Naruto mind, has every right to beat Jiraiya.\n\nIf you think that \"makes no sense whatsoever,\" that's fair, but take it up with Kishimoto - not me; though, Kishimoto *himself* *betrayed* this theme in late-Shippuden and made Madara and Hashirama gods, so perhaps you've got the *mangaka* on your side in finding the \"next generation\" stuff nonsensical...\n\nEither way, this is all irrelevant anyway - as I've already acknowledged myself as wrong; like I said: my mind is still stuck in OG Naruto.",

Itachi got way more blind in shippuden while fighting sasuke. And sasuke without orochimaru's training handled 2 tails naruto. So after training I assume he can handle upto 4 tails atleast. So itachi even though he went way more blind while fighting sasuke he was still holding back. So the power scale is pretty clear. And knowing itachi, he wouldn't let something like that ever happen. He would probably start by taking naruto down.",

Itachi showed no signs of being ill or going blind in part 1, and was several years older in part 2 when the illness became a factor and he only really started going blind because of his fight with Sasuke. Sure you could say Itachi's eye was straining after using some of his powers, but eye strain from using base Mangekyo is common and even happened to Sasuke. As we see later in the series an actually ill Itachi was able to tank through the eye strain. Its most likely that he retreated from the village on purpose because he was still working as a spy for them. \n\nItachi would've slapped Jiraiya around in that hotel. He was young with more stamina and without signs of illness. Jiraiya couldn't even pull out sage mode at that moment because it would take too long.\n\n[Part 2]\n\nDuring his fight with Sasuke, he was able to constantly spamming his Mangekyo (which is what was really causing him to go blind) **while sick.** He also **threw the fight on purpose.** The only reason the fight was so drawn out was because Itachi wanted drain Sasuke's chakra so that he could seal Orochimaru once he emerged from Sasuke's curse mark. Obito even told Sasuke that Itachi would kill him if he wasn't holding back, even while ill. Not saying Sasuke could beat Jiraiya, I'm just giving some evidence that shows that a serious Itachi certainly does have the stamina to beat Jiraiya even while ill.\n\nJust like how Jiraiya had trouble using ninjutsu against the preta path because it would absorb it, Jiraiya would have trouble against Itachi because his Yata Mirror would reflect it (which would be worse for him). Jiraiya's only genjutsu was the sound based genjutsu that required him to run away and take time to setup. Jiraiya can't resist the Tsukuyomi like Sasuke could either. Idk if Jiraiya could dodge the Amaterasu either because even while in sage mode he wasn't able to react to the Asura path's surprise attack. Gamabunta shouldn't be summoned either because the Totsuka blade would seal him (don't sacrifice my boi). Jiraiya may have more experience, but Itachi has w/out a doubt proven to be a smarter fighter as well. \n\nJiraiya has had goat status in my book since I was a child, but there is too much going against him in this hypothetical fight. I don't think the fight would be easy for Itachi, but Itachi would come out on top in the end.",

If they had infinite chakra none of these would happen. Sorry, jiraiya was probably intended to be as strong as itachi, but as the story progressed, jiraiya was ignored (besides comedic relief) and itachi was not.

By the ninja war arc Naruto is far stronger than he was against pain with or without the nine tails Chakra.\n\nOrochimaru and Jiraiya are designed to be equally strong opposing forces like Naruto and Sasuke or Madara and Hashirama.",

So was Jiraiya (kinda but not really).

Afaik it's not in the anime unless it's filler, in which case it doesn't matter at all.\n\nI'm not saying Orochimaru is stronger than Jiraiya or vise versa. Just that Jiraiya is not significantly stronger than Orochimaru. They're presented as evenly matched rivals.

He might not have been scared but he was secretly in awe as the flames tore a hole through the roads stomache, something that was seemingly impossible. Amaterasu was not legendary as canonically only five people had awoken MS and Itachi only knew two maybe three, as an Uchiha. Amaterasu was specific to him among them and he only used it as a trump card like tsukyomi as he didn't try to spam either one like Sasuke. Sage mode is somewhat known but the details aren't only that it increases chakra substantially, and Itachi would put two and two together as Jiraiya is more of an offensive fighter and he would need to halt movement to access it, though I will definitley give that one to you as that is dependent on Itachi being able to have that rumored info and ascertain the trick. Definitley that point again to you, it would be hard for Itachi to counter them not impossible but very difficult.",

It's so strong that the \"world ending jutsu\" is a large scale version of it and if you look at him wrong you're caught.

But if we do shonen rock-paper-scissors math, then if Itachi is on par with Sasuke, and Sasuke beat Orochimaru, and Orochimaru is on par with Jiraya, then that would put Itachi above Jiraya, even though that sort of rationale makes no sense.",

I know they never saw each other much but thats the same with orochimaru and jiraya. I don't see itachi and kisame beating pain. Seems like jiraya could have. Itachi is a really good all around fighter but jiraya is even more prepared for random stuff. He is like a super shikamaru with his weapons tool kit. And he just has way too many counters for both of kisame and Itachi's attacks and would understand what's going on. He would be too dangerous to keep in the water bubble, genjustu would only slightly work. He would be stronger than kisame and he would understand what Itachi is up to and what his susanoo weilds and how dangerous the susanoo is, it's even worse if they fight in Shippuden cause Itachi will die trying to fight. Based on people pointing out that Itachi could have been working with jiraiya, I don't know if Itachi thought he was stronger than jiraya, but I think that Itachi said they both would be killed if they fought just to get kisame to back off, but Itachi was underestimating jiraya there.",

I always figured he found a way to discreetly hand the info to the Hokage \"anonymously\" thus why Jiraiya didn't know where alot of the info came from. \n\nItachi probably knew tendou was a puppet as he would be able to recognize the chakra receiver rods\n\nJiraiya **might** be able to take Itachi on in his, Itachi, weakened state but kisame is a while other level. Jiraiya is alot like Naruto where in he relies heavily on his chakra and spams summonings and frog themed jutsu, so with kisame its more a question of who runs out first and while Jiraiya has a near limitless supply when attached to ma and pa he can be instantly capacitated, have ma and pa knocked of him or severely wounded and kisame is the real zero tails. And sharkskin could take all his sage chakra with a glancing blow\n\nI think alot of people get this wrong when they put this fight together in their heads. The main threat to Jiraiya is kisame, not Itachi. While Itachi is mostly a small jutsu user he uses very strong, targeted attacks. Jiraiya use not as powerful but still physically devastating attacks that affect a large range and that would keep Itachi on the defensive. \n\nThe reason pain beat him is because he tried to keep him on the defensive, which is not jiraiya's strong suit. This is what kisame would do very well. \n\nItachi's best bet is to actually stay on the defensive, leading Jiraiya to think he's not all hes cracked up to be. Thus leading him to be overconfident and not use ma and pa which is his downfall. Hell drain his chakra to where he can't summon them and then Itachi strikes **hard**.\n\nThank you for coming to my Ted Talk\u2122",

Just look at the Hiruzen Vs. Orochimaru fight for further proof - you'll notice Hiruzen was *handling* the *previous* Kage, along with being *afraid* of his *successor*.\n\nKakashi *himself*, before the *retcons*, said these things:\n\n>*In this world there are kids who are younger than you, and yet... stronger than me.*\r\n\n>>***The next generation will always surpass the previous one. It's one of the never-ending cycles in life.***\n\nItachi, along with being one of the premier Shinobi of Konoha - a *highly* prodigious *genius* - was, again, \"the next generation\"; he, therefore, in my stuck-in-OG-Naruto mind, has every right to beat Jiraiya.\n\nIf you think that \"makes no sense whatsoever,\" that's fair, but take it up with Kishimoto - not me; though, Kishimoto *himself* *betrayed* this theme in late-Shippuden and made Madara and Hashirama gods, so perhaps you've got the *mangaka* on your side in finding the \"next generation\" stuff nonsensical...\n\nEither way, this is all irrelevant anyway - as I've already acknowledged myself as wrong; like I said: my mind is still stuck in OG Naruto.",

As per Nagato, they\u2019re about equal. Naruto\u2019s Sage Mode was stronger but since Jiraiya was just stronger in base it evens out. As per Nagato, Jiraiya would\u2019ve beaten him if he\u2019d known the secret of the Paths technique. Seeing as Naruto is Sage Mode could react and actually manage to beat 3rd Raikage who is >4th Raikage who was on Minato\u2019s level, since Jiraiya is on that same level, he\u2019d definitely be fast enough to avoid Amaterasu, especially since Sage Mode grants precognition.\n\n4) Izanami isn\u2019t a catch all technique that can beat anyone. It\u2019s sole purpose is to trap someone who has become dangerously disconnected with reality. Jiraiya would just shrug it off and then Itachi\u2019s lost an eye for no reason",

And sasuke without orochimaru's training handled 2 tails naruto. So after training I assume he can handle upto 4 tails atleast. So itachi even though he went way more blind while fighting sasuke he was still holding back. So the power scale is pretty clear. And knowing itachi, he wouldn't let something like that ever happen. He would probably start by taking naruto down.",

Itachi showed no signs of being ill or going blind in part 1, and was several years older in part 2 when the illness became a factor and he only really started going blind because of his fight with Sasuke. Sure you could say Itachi's eye was straining after using some of his powers, but eye strain from using base Mangekyo is common and even happened to Sasuke. As we see later in the series an actually ill Itachi was able to tank through the eye strain. Its most likely that he retreated from the village on purpose because he was still working as a spy for them. \n\nItachi would've slapped Jiraiya around in that hotel. He was young with more stamina and without signs of illness. Jiraiya couldn't even pull out sage mode at that moment because it would take too long.\n\n[Part 2]\n\nDuring his fight with Sasuke, he was able to constantly spamming his Mangekyo (which is what was really causing him to go blind) **while sick.** He also **threw the fight on purpose.** The only reason the fight was so drawn out was because Itachi wanted drain Sasuke's chakra so that he could seal Orochimaru once he emerged from Sasuke's curse mark. Obito even told Sasuke that Itachi would kill him if he wasn't holding back, even while ill. Not saying Sasuke could beat Jiraiya, I'm just giving some evidence that shows that a serious Itachi certainly does have the stamina to beat Jiraiya even while ill.\n\nJust like how Jiraiya had trouble using ninjutsu against the preta path because it would absorb it, Jiraiya would have trouble against Itachi because his Yata Mirror would reflect it (which would be worse for him). Jiraiya's only genjutsu was the sound based genjutsu that required him to run away and take time to setup. Jiraiya can't resist the Tsukuyomi like Sasuke could either. Idk if Jiraiya could dodge the Amaterasu either because even while in sage mode he wasn't able to react to the Asura path's surprise attack. Gamabunta shouldn't be summoned either because the Totsuka blade would seal him (don't sacrifice my boi). Jiraiya may have more experience, but Itachi has w/out a doubt proven to be a smarter fighter as well. \n\nJiraiya has had goat status in my book since I was a child, but there is too much going against him in this hypothetical fight. I don't think the fight would be easy for Itachi, but Itachi would come out on top in the end.",

We all know itachi purposefully lost that fight against sasuke. Reanimated bodies also don\u2019t have unlimited chakra or stamina as we\u2019ve seen them get tired, we\u2019ve seen hashirama and minato say theyre low on chakra, we\u2019ve seen the second tsuchikage divide himself and not be able to use particle style. If they had infinite chakra none of these would happen. Sorry, jiraiya was probably intended to be as strong as itachi, but as the story progressed, jiraiya was ignored (besides comedic relief) and itachi was not. They need to make the villains stronger as the story progresses otherwise the heroes would just beat them. Itachi scales higher than jiraiya and from a story prospective it makes more sense for him to be stronger.",

The damage he took from that fight is why his condition accelerated and why Sasuke was able to take him out. Jiraiya managed to subdue 4-Tail Naruto in his base state. Pain was completely unconcerned with Oro, and absolutely wrecked him in an instant when they fought. Jiraiya not only put up a good fight in base, but Nagato outright said that if Jiraiya had known the secret behind the Pains, he very well might have won, which puts Sage Jiraiya on a similar level to Sage Naruto, who fought Kurama 1 v 1 and even fought on an even level alongside Tobirama goddamn Senju.",

Took forever to get into sage mode which could have easily been interrupted if all the pains were there from the beginning. He taught valiantly but in the end he still lost quite handily. It feels like the comment was more out of respect than actually true.\n\nNarutos mastery of sage jutsu far surpassed Jiraiya and had the nine tails not been there to bail him out he would have lost to pain.

By the ninja war arc Naruto is far stronger than he was against pain with or without the nine tails Chakra.\n\nOrochimaru and Jiraiya are designed to be equally strong opposing forces like Naruto and Sasuke or Madara and Hashirama.",

Jiraiya managed to win a fight that Oro said outright he would lose. That\u2019s as clear cut as possible.\n\nNaruto\u2019s Sage Jutsu is stronger than Jiraiya\u2019s but Jiraiya\u2019s haze state is equal to Orochimaru\u2019s at least. They\u2019re about equal because the force multiplier has more to multiply.\n\nAs for Pain, Naruto was fucking destroying Pain. Pain got one hit in the entire fight, which was when he managed to pin him. Outside of that, he was solidly kicking Pain\u2019s ass. Hell, he even beat Tendo in his base state, meaning the Pain that crushed Oro in an instant would be beaten by Jiraiya, unless you believe Pain Arc Bass Naruto>Jiraiya.",

Like with one of the seals Kakashi used on him but I could be wrong. Also he almost died in the process so idk what to say. Anyway orochimaru was in a weakened state from needing a new host body so it's not like we got peak orochimaru there.\n\nYeah Naruto was winning until he wasn't. So was Jiraiya (kinda but not really). That doesn't mean very much imo and Naruto had already surpassed Jiraiya by then.\n\nI have no idea where this Orochimaru vs Pain fight you're talking about exists. Afaik it's not in the anime unless it's filler, in which case it doesn't matter at all.\n\nI'm not saying Orochimaru is stronger than Jiraiya or vise versa. Just that Jiraiya is not significantly stronger than Orochimaru. They're presented as evenly matched rivals. Even if you feel like one would beat the other in a fight their power levels are very similar",

Amaterasu was specific to him among them and he only used it as a trump card like tsukyomi as he didn't try to spam either one like Sasuke. Sage mode is somewhat known but the details aren't only that it increases chakra substantially, and Itachi would put two and two together as Jiraiya is more of an offensive fighter and he would need to halt movement to access it, though I will definitley give that one to you as that is dependent on Itachi being able to have that rumored info and ascertain the trick.

He was only in the org to spy and protect the leaf, if he fights jiraya and kills him, how does that help? \n\nps: Kisame realistically would fight Jiraya pretty evenly. Itachi would end him pretty quickly. Jiraya might be great, but Kisame is basically a tailed beast with his sword. I don't think people understand just how powerful Itachi's genjutsu is. It's so strong that the \"world ending jutsu\" is a large scale version of it and if you look at him wrong you're caught. It's so strong they had to kill him off with a disease because he would have been plot breakingly strong.",

But if we do shonen rock-paper-scissors math, then if Itachi is on par with Sasuke, and Sasuke beat Orochimaru, and Orochimaru is on par with Jiraya, then that would put Itachi above Jiraya, even though that sort of rationale makes no sense.",

Itachi is a really good all around fighter but jiraya is even more prepared for random stuff. He is like a super shikamaru with his weapons tool kit. And he just has way too many counters for both of kisame and Itachi's attacks and would understand what's going on. He would be too dangerous to keep in the water bubble, genjustu would only slightly work. He would be stronger than kisame and he would understand what Itachi is up to and what his susanoo weilds and how dangerous the susanoo is, it's even worse if they fight in Shippuden cause Itachi will die trying to fight. Based on people pointing out that Itachi could have been working with jiraiya, I don't know if Itachi thought he was stronger than jiraya, but I think that Itachi said they both would be killed if they fought just to get kisame to back off, but Itachi was underestimating jiraya there.",

Jiraya is a bad ass, but, Itachi would have fared just as well if not better against Pain as Jiraya did.",

I always figured he found a way to discreetly hand the info to the Hokage \"anonymously\" thus why Jiraiya didn't know where alot of the info came from. \n\nItachi probably knew tendou was a puppet as he would be able to recognize the chakra receiver rods\n\nJiraiya **might** be able to take Itachi on in his, Itachi, weakened state but kisame is a while other level. Jiraiya is alot like Naruto where in he relies heavily on his chakra and spams summonings and frog themed jutsu, so with kisame its more a question of who runs out first and while Jiraiya has a near limitless supply when attached to ma and pa he can be instantly capacitated, have ma and pa knocked of him or severely wounded and kisame is the real zero tails. And sharkskin could take all his sage chakra with a glancing blow\n\nI think alot of people get this wrong when they put this fight together in their heads. The main threat to Jiraiya is kisame, not Itachi. While Itachi is mostly a small jutsu user he uses very strong, targeted attacks. Jiraiya use not as powerful but still physically devastating attacks that affect a large range and that would keep Itachi on the defensive. \n\nThe reason pain beat him is because he tried to keep him on the defensive, which is not jiraiya's strong suit. This is what kisame would do very well. \n\nItachi's best bet is to actually stay on the defensive, leading Jiraiya to think he's not all hes cracked up to be. Thus leading him to be overconfident and not use ma and pa which is his downfall. Hell drain his chakra to where he can't summon them and then Itachi strikes **hard**.\n\nThank you for coming to my Ted Talk\u2122",

Kisame was able to soundly defeat Bee in their fight, and there is no way that sage mode Jaraiya comes anywhere close to as strong as 8tails version 2 cloak Bee because even 6 tails version 2 cloak Naruto was stronger than sage Naruto who was stronger than Jiraiya.

Just look at the Hiruzen Vs. Orochimaru fight for further proof - you'll notice Hiruzen was *handling* the *previous* Kage, along with being *afraid* of his *successor*.\n\nKakashi *himself*, before the *retcons*, said these things:\n\n>*In this world there are kids who are younger than you, and yet... stronger than me.*\r\n\n>>***The next generation will always surpass the previous one. It's one of the never-ending cycles in life.***\n\nItachi, along with being one of the premier Shinobi of Konoha - a *highly* prodigious *genius* - was, again, \"the next generation\"; he, therefore, in my stuck-in-OG-Naruto mind, has every right to beat Jiraiya.\n\nIf you think that \"makes no sense whatsoever,\" that's fair, but take it up with Kishimoto - not me; though, Kishimoto *himself* *betrayed* this theme in late-Shippuden and made Madara and Hashirama gods, so perhaps you've got the *mangaka* on your side in finding the \"next generation\" stuff nonsensical...\n\nEither way, this is all irrelevant anyway - as I've already acknowledged myself as wrong; like I said: my mind is still stuck in OG Naruto.",

Canon makes it very clear that Itachi wasn\u2019t holding back specifically so he could ensure that Sasuke would be able to survive a fight with \u201cMadara\u201d\n\n3) Sage Mode Naruto is NOT stronger than Sage Mode Jiraiya. As per Nagato, they\u2019re about equal. Naruto\u2019s Sage Mode was stronger but since Jiraiya was just stronger in base it evens out. As per Nagato, Jiraiya would\u2019ve beaten him if he\u2019d known the secret of the Paths technique. Seeing as Naruto is Sage Mode could react and actually manage to beat 3rd Raikage who is >4th Raikage who was on Minato\u2019s level, since Jiraiya is on that same level, he\u2019d definitely be fast enough to avoid Amaterasu, especially since Sage Mode grants precognition.\n\n4) Izanami isn\u2019t a catch all technique that can beat anyone. It\u2019s sole purpose is to trap someone who has become dangerously disconnected with reality. Jiraiya would just shrug it off and then Itachi\u2019s lost an eye for no reason",

Itachi showed no signs of being ill or going blind in part 1, and was several years older in part 2 when the illness became a factor and he only really started going blind because of his fight with Sasuke. Sure you could say Itachi's eye was straining after using some of his powers, but eye strain from using base Mangekyo is common and even happened to Sasuke. As we see later in the series an actually ill Itachi was able to tank through the eye strain. Its most likely that he retreated from the village on purpose because he was still working as a spy for them. \n\nItachi would've slapped Jiraiya around in that hotel. He was young with more stamina and without signs of illness. Jiraiya couldn't even pull out sage mode at that moment because it would take too long.\n\n[Part 2]\n\nDuring his fight with Sasuke, he was able to constantly spamming his Mangekyo (which is what was really causing him to go blind) **while sick.** He also **threw the fight on purpose.** The only reason the fight was so drawn out was because Itachi wanted drain Sasuke's chakra so that he could seal Orochimaru once he emerged from Sasuke's curse mark. Obito even told Sasuke that Itachi would kill him if he wasn't holding back, even while ill. Not saying Sasuke could beat Jiraiya, I'm just giving some evidence that shows that a serious Itachi certainly does have the stamina to beat Jiraiya even while ill.\n\nJust like how Jiraiya had trouble using ninjutsu against the preta path because it would absorb it, Jiraiya would have trouble against Itachi because his Yata Mirror would reflect it (which would be worse for him). Jiraiya's only genjutsu was the sound based genjutsu that required him to run away and take time to setup. Jiraiya can't resist the Tsukuyomi like Sasuke could either. Idk if Jiraiya could dodge the Amaterasu either because even while in sage mode he wasn't able to react to the Asura path's surprise attack. Gamabunta shouldn't be summoned either because the Totsuka blade would seal him (don't sacrifice my boi). Jiraiya may have more experience, but Itachi has w/out a doubt proven to be a smarter fighter as well. \n\nJiraiya has had goat status in my book since I was a child, but there is too much going against him in this hypothetical fight. I don't think the fight would be easy for Itachi, but Itachi would come out on top in the end.",

Additionally reanimated bodies have unlimited chakra and stamina and are basically immortal unless sealed. Stop bending facts to make itachi sound like unbeatable. Itachi was very strong, that's why the author gave him the illness aur eyesight loss to balance it out. This is not dragon ball z.",

We all know itachi purposefully lost that fight against sasuke. Reanimated bodies also don\u2019t have unlimited chakra or stamina as we\u2019ve seen them get tired, we\u2019ve seen hashirama and minato say theyre low on chakra, we\u2019ve seen the second tsuchikage divide himself and not be able to use particle style. If they had infinite chakra none of these would happen. Sorry, jiraiya was probably intended to be as strong as itachi, but as the story progressed, jiraiya was ignored (besides comedic relief) and itachi was not. They need to make the villains stronger as the story progresses otherwise the heroes would just beat them. Itachi scales higher than jiraiya and from a story prospective it makes more sense for him to be stronger.",

The damage he took from that fight is why his condition accelerated and why Sasuke was able to take him out. Jiraiya managed to subdue 4-Tail Naruto in his base state. Pain was completely unconcerned with Oro, and absolutely wrecked him in an instant when they fought. Jiraiya not only put up a good fight in base, but Nagato outright said that if Jiraiya had known the secret behind the Pains, he very well might have won, which puts Sage Jiraiya on a similar level to Sage Naruto, who fought Kurama 1 v 1 and even fought on an even level alongside Tobirama goddamn Senju.",

Took forever to get into sage mode which could have easily been interrupted if all the pains were there from the beginning. He taught valiantly but in the end he still lost quite handily. It feels like the comment was more out of respect than actually true.\n\nNarutos mastery of sage jutsu far surpassed Jiraiya and had the nine tails not been there to bail him out he would have lost to pain. By this point Naruto is already stronger than Jiraiya. By the ninja war arc Naruto is far stronger than he was against pain with or without the nine tails Chakra.\n\nOrochimaru and Jiraiya are designed to be equally strong opposing forces like Naruto and Sasuke or Madara and Hashirama.",

They\u2019re about equal because the force multiplier has more to multiply.\n\nAs for Pain, Naruto was fucking destroying Pain.

Anyway orochimaru was in a weakened state from needing a new host body so it's not like we got peak orochimaru there.\n\nYeah Naruto was winning until he wasn't. So was Jiraiya (kinda but not really). That doesn't mean very much imo and Naruto had already surpassed Jiraiya by then.\n\nI have no idea where this Orochimaru vs Pain fight you're talking about exists. Afaik it's not in the anime unless it's filler, in which case it doesn't matter at all.\n\nI'm not saying Orochimaru is stronger than Jiraiya or vise versa. Just that Jiraiya is not significantly stronger than Orochimaru. They're presented as evenly matched rivals. Even if you feel like one would beat the other in a fight their power levels are very similar",

He might not have been scared but he was secretly in awe as the flames tore a hole through the roads stomache, something that was seemingly impossible. Amaterasu was not legendary as canonically only five people had awoken MS and Itachi only knew two maybe three, as an Uchiha. Amaterasu was specific to him among them and he only used it as a trump card like tsukyomi as he didn't try to spam either one like Sasuke. Sage mode is somewhat known but the details aren't only that it increases chakra substantially, and Itachi would put two and two together as Jiraiya is more of an offensive fighter and he would need to halt movement to access it, though I will definitley give that one to you as that is dependent on Itachi being able to have that rumored info and ascertain the trick. Definitley that point again to you, it would be hard for Itachi to counter them not impossible but very difficult.",

It's so strong that the \"world ending jutsu\" is a large scale version of it and if you look at him wrong you're caught. It's so strong they had to kill him off with a disease because he would have been plot breakingly strong.",

But if we do shonen rock-paper-scissors math, then if Itachi is on par with Sasuke, and Sasuke beat Orochimaru, and Orochimaru is on par with Jiraya, then that would put Itachi above Jiraya, even though that sort of rationale makes no sense.",

I know they never saw each other much but thats the same with orochimaru and jiraya. I don't see itachi and kisame beating pain. Seems like jiraya could have. Itachi is a really good all around fighter but jiraya is even more prepared for random stuff. He is like a super shikamaru with his weapons tool kit. And he just has way too many counters for both of kisame and Itachi's attacks and would understand what's going on. He would be too dangerous to keep in the water bubble, genjustu would only slightly work. He would be stronger than kisame and he would understand what Itachi is up to and what his susanoo weilds and how dangerous the susanoo is, it's even worse if they fight in Shippuden cause Itachi will die trying to fight. Based on people pointing out that Itachi could have been working with jiraiya, I don't know if Itachi thought he was stronger than jiraya, but I think that Itachi said they both would be killed if they fought just to get kisame to back off, but Itachi was underestimating jiraya there.",

I always figured he found a way to discreetly hand the info to the Hokage \"anonymously\" thus why Jiraiya didn't know where alot of the info came from. \n\nItachi probably knew tendou was a puppet as he would be able to recognize the chakra receiver rods\n\nJiraiya **might** be able to take Itachi on in his, Itachi, weakened state but kisame is a while other level. Jiraiya is alot like Naruto where in he relies heavily on his chakra and spams summonings and frog themed jutsu, so with kisame its more a question of who runs out first and while Jiraiya has a near limitless supply when attached to ma and pa he can be instantly capacitated, have ma and pa knocked of him or severely wounded and kisame is the real zero tails. And sharkskin could take all his sage chakra with a glancing blow\n\nI think alot of people get this wrong when they put this fight together in their heads. The main threat to Jiraiya is kisame, not Itachi. While Itachi is mostly a small jutsu user he uses very strong, targeted attacks. Jiraiya use not as powerful but still physically devastating attacks that affect a large range and that would keep Itachi on the defensive. \n\nThe reason pain beat him is because he tried to keep him on the defensive, which is not jiraiya's strong suit. This is what kisame would do very well. \n\nItachi's best bet is to actually stay on the defensive, leading Jiraiya to think he's not all hes cracked up to be. Thus leading him to be overconfident and not use ma and pa which is his downfall. Hell drain his chakra to where he can't summon them and then Itachi strikes **hard**.\n\nThank you for coming to my Ted Talk\u2122",

Jiraiya was already looking Itachi in the eyes during their encounter, prime alive Itachi was able to soundly defeat Nagato who was far stronger than the pains that defeated Jiraiya. Not to mention that 13 year old Itachi man handled Orochimaru like he was nothing when Orochimaru is Jiraiya\u2019s superior in every way. Kisame was able to soundly defeat Bee in their fight, and there is no way that sage mode Jaraiya comes anywhere close to as strong as 8tails version 2 cloak Bee because even 6 tails version 2 cloak Naruto was stronger than sage Naruto who was stronger than Jiraiya. There is no way he could take on one of them and hope to win, let alone both.",

He literally just whipped out the scroll and set it off.\n\n2) Itachi was not holding back. That is complete fanon. Canon makes it very clear that Itachi wasn\u2019t holding back specifically so he could ensure that Sasuke would be able to survive a fight with \u201cMadara\u201d\n\n3) Sage Mode Naruto is NOT stronger than Sage Mode Jiraiya. As per Nagato, they\u2019re about equal. Naruto\u2019s Sage Mode was stronger but since Jiraiya was just stronger in base it evens out. As per Nagato, Jiraiya would\u2019ve beaten him if he\u2019d known the secret of the Paths technique. Seeing as Naruto is Sage Mode could react and actually manage to beat 3rd Raikage who is >4th Raikage who was on Minato\u2019s level, since Jiraiya is on that same level, he\u2019d definitely be fast enough to avoid Amaterasu, especially since Sage Mode grants precognition.\n\n4) Izanami isn\u2019t a catch all technique that can beat anyone. It\u2019s sole purpose is to trap someone who has become dangerously disconnected with reality. Jiraiya would just shrug it off and then Itachi\u2019s lost an eye for no reason",

            "body": "You make it sound like Itachi was seriously ill and going blind when he met Jiraiya. Itachi showed no signs of being ill or going blind in part 1, and was several years older in part 2 when the illness became a factor and he only really started going blind because of his fight with Sasuke. Sure you could say Itachi's eye was straining after using some of his powers, but eye strain from using base Mangekyo is common and even happened to Sasuke. As we see later in the series an actually ill Itachi was able to tank through the eye strain. Its most likely that he retreated from the village on purpose because he was still working as a spy for them. \n\nItachi would've slapped Jiraiya around in that hotel. He was young with more stamina and without signs of illness. Jiraiya couldn't even pull out sage mode at that moment because it would take too long.\n\n[Part 2]\n\nDuring his fight with Sasuke, he was able to constantly spamming his Mangekyo (which is what was really causing him to go blind) **while sick.** He also **threw the fight on purpose.** The only reason the fight was so drawn out was because Itachi wanted drain Sasuke's chakra so that he could seal Orochimaru once he emerged from Sasuke's curse mark. Obito even told Sasuke that Itachi would kill him if he wasn't holding back, even while ill. Not saying Sasuke could beat Jiraiya, I'm just giving some evidence that shows that a serious Itachi certainly does have the stamina to beat Jiraiya even while ill.\n\nJust like how Jiraiya had trouble using ninjutsu against the preta path because it would absorb it, Jiraiya would have trouble against Itachi because his Yata Mirror would reflect it (which would be worse for him). Jiraiya's only genjutsu was the sound based genjutsu that required him to run away and take time to setup. Jiraiya can't resist the Tsukuyomi like Sasuke could either. Idk if Jiraiya could dodge the Amaterasu either because even while in sage mode he wasn't able to react to the Asura path's surprise attack. Gamabunta shouldn't be summoned either because the Totsuka blade would seal him (don't sacrifice my boi). Jiraiya may have more experience, but Itachi has w/out a doubt proven to be a smarter fighter as well. \n\nJiraiya has had goat status in my book since I was a child, but there is too much going against him in this hypothetical fight. I don't think the fight would be easy for Itachi, but Itachi would come out on top in the end.",

Because I thought Itachi was pretty much balanced because of his partial blindness and illness. And that's how naruto should have proceeded. Super powers that required super sacrifice, like guy's 8th gate of death which would grant ultimate power but would inevitably result in death.",

If they had infinite chakra none of these would happen. Sorry, jiraiya was probably intended to be as strong as itachi, but as the story progressed, jiraiya was ignored (besides comedic relief) and itachi was not. They need to make the villains stronger as the story progresses otherwise the heroes would just beat them.

The damage he took from that fight is why his condition accelerated and why Sasuke was able to take him out. Jiraiya managed to subdue 4-Tail Naruto in his base state. Pain was completely unconcerned with Oro, and absolutely wrecked him in an instant when they fought. Jiraiya not only put up a good fight in base, but Nagato outright said that if Jiraiya had known the secret behind the Pains, he very well might have won, which puts Sage Jiraiya on a similar level to Sage Naruto, who fought Kurama 1 v 1 and even fought on an even level alongside Tobirama goddamn Senju.",

Took forever to get into sage mode which could have easily been interrupted if all the pains were there from the beginning. He taught valiantly but in the end he still lost quite handily. It feels like the comment was more out of respect than actually true.\n\nNarutos mastery of sage jutsu far surpassed Jiraiya and had the nine tails not been there to bail him out he would have lost to pain. By this point Naruto is already stronger than Jiraiya. By the ninja war arc Naruto is far stronger than he was against pain with or without the nine tails Chakra.\n\nOrochimaru and Jiraiya are designed to be equally strong opposing forces like Naruto and Sasuke or Madara and Hashirama.",

They\u2019re about equal because the force multiplier has more to multiply.\n\nAs for Pain, Naruto was fucking destroying Pain. Pain got one hit in the entire fight, which was when he managed to pin him. Outside of that, he was solidly kicking Pain\u2019s ass.

Anyway orochimaru was in a weakened state from needing a new host body so it's not like we got peak orochimaru there.\n\nYeah Naruto was winning until he wasn't. So was Jiraiya (kinda but not really). That doesn't mean very much imo and Naruto had already surpassed Jiraiya by then.\n\nI have no idea where this Orochimaru vs Pain fight you're talking about exists. Afaik it's not in the anime unless it's filler, in which case it doesn't matter at all.\n\nI'm not saying Orochimaru is stronger than Jiraiya or vise versa. Just that Jiraiya is not significantly stronger than Orochimaru. They're presented as evenly matched rivals. Even if you feel like one would beat the other in a fight their power levels are very similar",

Amaterasu was specific to him among them and he only used it as a trump card like tsukyomi as he didn't try to spam either one like Sasuke. Sage mode is somewhat known but the details aren't only that it increases chakra substantially, and Itachi would put two and two together as Jiraiya is more of an offensive fighter and he would need to halt movement to access it, though I will definitley give that one to you as that is dependent on Itachi being able to have that rumored info and ascertain the trick.

I know they never saw each other much but thats the same with orochimaru and jiraya. I don't see itachi and kisame beating pain. Seems like jiraya could have. Itachi is a really good all around fighter but jiraya is even more prepared for random stuff. He is like a super shikamaru with his weapons tool kit. And he just has way too many counters for both of kisame and Itachi's attacks and would understand what's going on. He would be too dangerous to keep in the water bubble, genjustu would only slightly work. He would be stronger than kisame and he would understand what Itachi is up to and what his susanoo weilds and how dangerous the susanoo is, it's even worse if they fight in Shippuden cause Itachi will die trying to fight. Based on people pointing out that Itachi could have been working with jiraiya, I don't know if Itachi thought he was stronger than jiraya, but I think that Itachi said they both would be killed if they fought just to get kisame to back off, but Itachi was underestimating jiraya there.",

Canon makes it very clear that Itachi wasn\u2019t holding back specifically so he could ensure that Sasuke would be able to survive a fight with \u201cMadara\u201d\n\n3) Sage Mode Naruto is NOT stronger than Sage Mode Jiraiya. As per Nagato, they\u2019re about equal. Naruto\u2019s Sage Mode was stronger but since Jiraiya was just stronger in base it evens out. As per Nagato, Jiraiya would\u2019ve beaten him if he\u2019d known the secret of the Paths technique. Seeing as Naruto is Sage Mode could react and actually manage to beat 3rd Raikage who is >4th Raikage who was on Minato\u2019s level, since Jiraiya is on that same level, he\u2019d definitely be fast enough to avoid Amaterasu, especially since Sage Mode grants precognition.\n\n4) Izanami isn\u2019t a catch all technique that can beat anyone. It\u2019s sole purpose is to trap someone who has become dangerously disconnected with reality. Jiraiya would just shrug it off and then Itachi\u2019s lost an eye for no reason",

Then came mangekyou sharingan and susanoo and all that dragon ball z stuff and well, series went downhill(though I still love naruto) . I am not saying Itachi is to blame. Because I thought Itachi was pretty much balanced because of his partial blindness and illness. And that's how naruto should have proceeded. Super powers that required super sacrifice, like guy's 8th gate of death which would grant ultimate power but would inevitably result in death.",

If they had infinite chakra none of these would happen. Sorry, jiraiya was probably intended to be as strong as itachi, but as the story progressed, jiraiya was ignored (besides comedic relief) and itachi was not. They need to make the villains stronger as the story progresses otherwise the heroes would just beat them.

Took forever to get into sage mode which could have easily been interrupted if all the pains were there from the beginning. He taught valiantly but in the end he still lost quite handily. It feels like the comment was more out of respect than actually true.\n\nNarutos mastery of sage jutsu far surpassed Jiraiya and had the nine tails not been there to bail him out he would have lost to pain. By this point Naruto is already stronger than Jiraiya. By the ninja war arc Naruto is far stronger than he was against pain with or without the nine tails Chakra.\n\nOrochimaru and Jiraiya are designed to be equally strong opposing forces like Naruto and Sasuke or Madara and Hashirama.",

They\u2019re about equal because the force multiplier has more to multiply.\n\nAs for Pain, Naruto was fucking destroying Pain. Pain got one hit in the entire fight, which was when he managed to pin him. Outside of that, he was solidly kicking Pain\u2019s ass. Hell, he even beat Tendo in his base state, meaning the Pain that crushed Oro in an instant would be beaten by Jiraiya, unless you believe Pain Arc Bass Naruto>Jiraiya.",

Like with one of the seals Kakashi used on him but I could be wrong. Also he almost died in the process so idk what to say. Anyway orochimaru was in a weakened state from needing a new host body so it's not like we got peak orochimaru there.\n\nYeah Naruto was winning until he wasn't. So was Jiraiya (kinda but not really). That doesn't mean very much imo and Naruto had already surpassed Jiraiya by then.\n\nI have no idea where this Orochimaru vs Pain fight you're talking about exists. Afaik it's not in the anime unless it's filler, in which case it doesn't matter at all.\n\nI'm not saying Orochimaru is stronger than Jiraiya or vise versa. Just that Jiraiya is not significantly stronger than Orochimaru. They're presented as evenly matched rivals. Even if you feel like one would beat the other in a fight their power levels are very similar",

He might not have been scared but he was secretly in awe as the flames tore a hole through the roads stomache, something that was seemingly impossible. Amaterasu was not legendary as canonically only five people had awoken MS and Itachi only knew two maybe three, as an Uchiha. Amaterasu was specific to him among them and he only used it as a trump card like tsukyomi as he didn't try to spam either one like Sasuke. Sage mode is somewhat known but the details aren't only that it increases chakra substantially, and Itachi would put two and two together as Jiraiya is more of an offensive fighter and he would need to halt movement to access it, though I will definitley give that one to you as that is dependent on Itachi being able to have that rumored info and ascertain the trick. Definitley that point again to you, it would be hard for Itachi to counter them not impossible but very difficult.",

Itachi would end him pretty quickly. Jiraya might be great, but Kisame is basically a tailed beast with his sword. I don't think people understand just how powerful Itachi's genjutsu is. It's so strong that the \"world ending jutsu\" is a large scale version of it and if you look at him wrong you're caught. It's so strong they had to kill him off with a disease because he would have been plot breakingly strong.",

But if we do shonen rock-paper-scissors math, then if Itachi is on par with Sasuke, and Sasuke beat Orochimaru, and Orochimaru is on par with Jiraya, then that would put Itachi above Jiraya, even though that sort of rationale makes no sense.",

Sage Jiraiya was on a completely different level. He\u2019d easily whip out his pre-prepared seal which is what we saw",

If his eyes were atleast like it were in while fighting Kakashi, there's no way sasuke could avoid it. And don't forget itachi was holding back while fighting sasuke and he was already at his limit.\n\nAnd lastly, sage mode naruto > sage jiraiya. Now think about this. Can naruto really dodge or avoid amaterasu? And I don't think u can pre prepare any seal it just doesn't make sense. And it was no where shown or mentioned and even logically it's not possible",

Canon makes it very clear that Itachi wasn\u2019t holding back specifically so he could ensure that Sasuke would be able to survive a fight with \u201cMadara\u201d\n\n3) Sage Mode Naruto is NOT stronger than Sage Mode Jiraiya. As per Nagato, they\u2019re about equal. Naruto\u2019s Sage Mode was stronger but since Jiraiya was just stronger in base it evens out. As per Nagato, Jiraiya would\u2019ve beaten him if he\u2019d known the secret of the Paths technique. Seeing as Naruto is Sage Mode could react and actually manage to beat 3rd Raikage who is >4th Raikage who was on Minato\u2019s level, since Jiraiya is on that same level, he\u2019d definitely be fast enough to avoid Amaterasu, especially since Sage Mode grants precognition.\n\n4) Izanami isn\u2019t a catch all technique that can beat anyone. It\u2019s sole purpose is to trap someone who has become dangerously disconnected with reality. Jiraiya would just shrug it off and then Itachi\u2019s lost an eye for no reason",

If they had infinite chakra none of these would happen. Sorry, jiraiya was probably intended to be as strong as itachi, but as the story progressed, jiraiya was ignored (besides comedic relief) and itachi was not. They need to make the villains stronger as the story progresses otherwise the heroes would just beat them.

Took forever to get into sage mode which could have easily been interrupted if all the pains were there from the beginning. He taught valiantly but in the end he still lost quite handily. It feels like the comment was more out of respect than actually true.\n\nNarutos mastery of sage jutsu far surpassed Jiraiya and had the nine tails not been there to bail him out he would have lost to pain. By this point Naruto is already stronger than Jiraiya. By the ninja war arc Naruto is far stronger than he was against pain with or without the nine tails Chakra.\n\nOrochimaru and Jiraiya are designed to be equally strong opposing forces like Naruto and Sasuke or Madara and Hashirama.",

They\u2019re about equal because the force multiplier has more to multiply.\n\nAs for Pain, Naruto was fucking destroying Pain. Pain got one hit in the entire fight, which was when he managed to pin him. Outside of that, he was solidly kicking Pain\u2019s ass. Hell, he even beat Tendo in his base state, meaning the Pain that crushed Oro in an instant would be beaten by Jiraiya, unless you believe Pain Arc Bass Naruto>Jiraiya.",

Like with one of the seals Kakashi used on him but I could be wrong. Also he almost died in the process so idk what to say. Anyway orochimaru was in a weakened state from needing a new host body so it's not like we got peak orochimaru there.\n\nYeah Naruto was winning until he wasn't. So was Jiraiya (kinda but not really). That doesn't mean very much imo and Naruto had already surpassed Jiraiya by then.\n\nI have no idea where this Orochimaru vs Pain fight you're talking about exists. Afaik it's not in the anime unless it's filler, in which case it doesn't matter at all.\n\nI'm not saying Orochimaru is stronger than Jiraiya or vise versa. Just that Jiraiya is not significantly stronger than Orochimaru. They're presented as evenly matched rivals. Even if you feel like one would beat the other in a fight their power levels are very similar",

Amaterasu was specific to him among them and he only used it as a trump card like tsukyomi as he didn't try to spam either one like Sasuke. Sage mode is somewhat known but the details aren't only that it increases chakra substantially, and Itachi would put two and two together as Jiraiya is more of an offensive fighter and he would need to halt movement to access it, though I will definitley give that one to you as that is dependent on Itachi being able to have that rumored info and ascertain the trick.

But if we do shonen rock-paper-scissors math, then if Itachi is on par with Sasuke, and Sasuke beat Orochimaru, and Orochimaru is on par with Jiraya, then that would put Itachi above Jiraya, even though that sort of rationale makes no sense.",

As per Nagato, they\u2019re about equal. Naruto\u2019s Sage Mode was stronger but since Jiraiya was just stronger in base it evens out. As per Nagato, Jiraiya would\u2019ve beaten him if he\u2019d known the secret of the Paths technique. Seeing as Naruto is Sage Mode could react and actually manage to beat 3rd Raikage who is >4th Raikage who was on Minato\u2019s level, since Jiraiya is on that same level, he\u2019d definitely be fast enough to avoid Amaterasu, especially since Sage Mode grants precognition.\n\n4) Izanami isn\u2019t a catch all technique that can beat anyone. It\u2019s sole purpose is to trap someone who has become dangerously disconnected with reality. Jiraiya would just shrug it off and then Itachi\u2019s lost an eye for no reason",

Amaterasu was specific to him among them and he only used it as a trump card like tsukyomi as he didn't try to spam either one like Sasuke. Sage mode is somewhat known but the details aren't only that it increases chakra substantially, and Itachi would put two and two together as Jiraiya is more of an offensive fighter and he would need to halt movement to access it, though I will definitley give that one to you as that is dependent on Itachi being able to have that rumored info and ascertain the trick. Definitley that point again to you, it would be hard for Itachi to counter them not impossible but very difficult.",

And finally surpassed hashirama when he got kcm.\nIt's not only about kages. It can be anyone of next gen who can surpass the previous ones.

The point is someone shouldn't be stronger just because they are the next generation. They should be stronger because of their own life experiences and training. The whole \"They should be stronger because they are new\" arguement is terrible imo.",

As per Nagato, Jiraiya would\u2019ve beaten him if he\u2019d known the secret of the Paths technique. Seeing as Naruto is Sage Mode could react and actually manage to beat 3rd Raikage who is >4th Raikage who was on Minato\u2019s level, since Jiraiya is on that same level, he\u2019d definitely be fast enough to avoid Amaterasu, especially since Sage Mode grants precognition.\n\n4) Izanami isn\u2019t a catch all technique that can beat anyone. It\u2019s sole purpose is to trap someone who has become dangerously disconnected with reality. Jiraiya would just shrug it off and then Itachi\u2019s lost an eye for no reason",

Anyway orochimaru was in a weakened state from needing a new host body so it's not like we got peak orochimaru there.\n\nYeah Naruto was winning until he wasn't. So was Jiraiya (kinda but not really).

Afaik it's not in the anime unless it's filler, in which case it doesn't matter at all.\n\nI'm not saying Orochimaru is stronger than Jiraiya or vise versa. Just that Jiraiya is not significantly stronger than Orochimaru. They're presented as evenly matched rivals.

As per Nagato, they\u2019re about equal. Naruto\u2019s Sage Mode was stronger but since Jiraiya was just stronger in base it evens out. As per Nagato, Jiraiya would\u2019ve beaten him if he\u2019d known the secret of the Paths technique. Seeing as Naruto is Sage Mode could react and actually manage to beat 3rd Raikage who is >4th Raikage who was on Minato\u2019s level, since Jiraiya is on that same level, he\u2019d definitely be fast enough to avoid Amaterasu, especially since Sage Mode grants precognition.\n\n4) Izanami isn\u2019t a catch all technique that can beat anyone. It\u2019s sole purpose is to trap someone who has become dangerously disconnected with reality. Jiraiya would just shrug it off and then Itachi\u2019s lost an eye for no reason",
