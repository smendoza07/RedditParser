The usual recommendation for that is squarish frames that angle up at the sizes. I think the idea is if you wear obviously squarish (or rectangular) glasses, then by comparison your face looks less square. If you search face shape and glasses, you will find lots of advice. \n\nYour hair looks nice and sharp. You could maybe ask your barber to line it up straight in the front regardless of your actual hairline.",

They fit people with glasses all the time and tend to be pretty nice. You don\u2019t have to buy glasses there\u2014they\u2019re quite expensive. But they have a nice wide selection. This is something I have done many times, and I find they\u2019re used to people trying on glasses to find the right style for them.\n\nI just found that the search sources recommend oval and round styles for square faces, but that\u2019s the opposite of what I have found for recommendations in the past. Why don\u2019t you take your sister or female cousin or a woman friend with you to try on glasses? Unless you are into men, in which case bring your male friends.\n\nBe aware that you might feel pressured by the people you\u2019re with, just because they\u2019re there. If so, you can always go alone, find the ones you like, and THEN bring a friend to help you choose. Or you can just take pics of yourself wearing the ones you like and show them. \n\nTrying on glasses is time consuming, so plan on doing a \u201cresearch\u201d visit and purchasing later. That way there\u2019s no pressure on you. Have fun with it!\n\nI love trying on glasses, but I find I have to try on like a hundred pairs to find the right one. You will know the right one when you immediately feel like they\u2019re a good look and you keep coming back to it. \n\nGood luck my friend\u2014and as for the medal, you put a smile on my face so we\u2019re good \ud83d\ude0e",

The usual recommendation for that is squarish frames that angle up at the sizes.

If you search face shape and glasses, you will find lots of advice. \n\nYour hair looks nice and sharp. You could maybe ask your barber to line it up straight in the front regardless of your actual hairline.",

This is something I have done many times, and I find they\u2019re used to people trying on glasses to find the right style for them.\n\nI just found that the search sources recommend oval and round styles for square faces, but that\u2019s the opposite of what I have found for recommendations in the past. Why don\u2019t you take your sister or female cousin or a woman friend with you to try on glasses? Unless you are into men, in which case bring your male friends.\n\nBe aware that you might feel pressured by the people you\u2019re with, just because they\u2019re there. If so, you can always go alone, find the ones you like, and THEN bring a friend to help you choose. Or you can just take pics of yourself wearing the ones you like and show them. \n\nTrying on glasses is time consuming, so plan on doing a \u201cresearch\u201d visit and purchasing later. That way there\u2019s no pressure on you. Have fun with it!\n\nI love trying on glasses, but I find I have to try on like a hundred pairs to find the right one. You will know the right one when you immediately feel like they\u2019re a good look and you keep coming back to it. \n\nGood luck my friend\u2014and as for the medal, you put a smile on my face so we\u2019re good \ud83d\ude0e",

They fit people with glasses all the time and tend to be pretty nice. You don\u2019t have to buy glasses there\u2014they\u2019re quite expensive. But they have a nice wide selection. This is something I have done many times, and I find they\u2019re used to people trying on glasses to find the right style for them.\n\nI just found that the search sources recommend oval and round styles for square faces, but that\u2019s the opposite of what I have found for recommendations in the past. Why don\u2019t you take your sister or female cousin or a woman friend with you to try on glasses? Unless you are into men, in which case bring your male friends.\n\nBe aware that you might feel pressured by the people you\u2019re with, just because they\u2019re there. If so, you can always go alone, find the ones you like, and THEN bring a friend to help you choose. Or you can just take pics of yourself wearing the ones you like and show them. \n\nTrying on glasses is time consuming, so plan on doing a \u201cresearch\u201d visit and purchasing later. That way there\u2019s no pressure on you. Have fun with it!\n\nI love trying on glasses, but I find I have to try on like a hundred pairs to find the right one. You will know the right one when you immediately feel like they\u2019re a good look and you keep coming back to it. \n\nGood luck my friend\u2014and as for the medal, you put a smile on my face so we\u2019re good \ud83d\ude0e",
