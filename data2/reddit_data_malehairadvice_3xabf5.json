If I still had it i would have shipped it to you for free.\n\nNumber one thing was the smell was just way too powerful for me. I was constantly smelling it once putting in my hair. And it was just a boring salon product smell. It felt like there was dirt in my hair, which I didn't like...kind of made my hair feel dry. It did nothing to tame my waves for me. It just wasn't a product I liked.\n\nFrom everything I'm reading it seems their only worthwhile product is their claymation. A dude on YouTube did a review comparing it to Lockhart matte clay, and daimon barber clay, he liked daimon barber the most and also liked claymation.\n\nA product that did work well for me was Kevin Murphy night rider, but it hardens up, dried out my hair, and left annoying flakes in my hair but it did tame my waves and allowed me to style my hair I wanted in a more matte fashion.\n\nIf you are looking for volume and a matte look, by all means try out claymation from hdf. If you want some volume with some shine, check out grim grease heavy hold or flagship blackship. Both great home brew products.",

If I still had it i would have shipped it to you for free.\n\nNumber one thing was the smell was just way too powerful for me. I was constantly smelling it once putting in my hair. And it was just a boring salon product smell. It felt like there was dirt in my hair, which I didn't like...kind of made my hair feel dry. It did nothing to tame my waves for me. It just wasn't a product I liked.\n\nFrom everything I'm reading it seems their only worthwhile product is their claymation. A dude on YouTube did a review comparing it to Lockhart matte clay, and daimon barber clay, he liked daimon barber the most and also liked claymation.\n\nA product that did work well for me was Kevin Murphy night rider, but it hardens up, dried out my hair, and left annoying flakes in my hair but it did tame my waves and allowed me to style my hair I wanted in a more matte fashion.\n\nIf you are looking for volume and a matte look, by all means try out claymation from hdf. If you want some volume with some shine, check out grim grease heavy hold or flagship blackship. Both great home brew products.",
