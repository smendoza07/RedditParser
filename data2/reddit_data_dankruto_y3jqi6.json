If Naruto becomes loved by the Leaf they would make him hokage and the other countries would fear what Naruto would do.\n\n===\n\nNaruto wants Sasuke out of prison? They let Sasuke out of prison. Why? Because of the implication. The rest of the world keeps him in prison and Naruto ends them.\n\n===\n\nNaruto is a good dude but the number of ppl that really know this is something like the reader, Naruto, Gaara and his siblings, and Bee. The leaf ends up knowing this... But this isn't enough for the rest of the world to not shit their collective pants when this WMD becomes a dictator.\n\n ===\n\nEver wonder why Kurai and Choji get married? Political marriage to Naruto's friend keeps Naruto from targeting Lightning country because Naruto sees Karui as a nice person. Yeah Partial Expansion Jutsu is just, the best thing ever, but political marriage is nice too.\n\n===\n\nPain won, he got exactly what he wanted and not only did he Talk no Jutsu Naruto, he Talk no Jutsu the reader.",

Pain was just smart, and flexible enough, to adapt. If Naruto becomes loved by the Leaf they would make him hokage and the other countries would fear what Naruto would do.\n\n===\n\nNaruto wants Sasuke out of prison? They let Sasuke out of prison. Why? Because of the implication. The rest of the world keeps him in prison and Naruto ends them.\n\n===\n\nNaruto is a good dude but the number of ppl that really know this is something like the reader, Naruto, Gaara and his siblings, and Bee. The leaf ends up knowing this... But this isn't enough for the rest of the world to not shit their collective pants when this WMD becomes a dictator.\n\n ===\n\nEver wonder why Kurai and Choji get married? Political marriage to Naruto's friend keeps Naruto from targeting Lightning country because Naruto sees Karui as a nice person. Yeah Partial Expansion Jutsu is just, the best thing ever, but political marriage is nice too.\n\n===\n\nPain won, he got exactly what he wanted and not only did he Talk no Jutsu Naruto, he Talk no Jutsu the reader.",
