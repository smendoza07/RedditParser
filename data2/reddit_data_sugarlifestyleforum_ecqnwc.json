    "body": "Let me tell you that it was amazing. This man literally treats me like a queen. We laid in bed almost all day screwing, cuddling, and napping. He told me to stay in bed and then brought me snacks. He cleaned me up after each round (where he is very giving I might add). He can always tell when I need a break and stops and cuddles me even if he was getting close. Anyway, we finally got up to eat later on, and then he helped me with my assignments I was struggling with. \n\nHe's in the profession I'm trying to get into so he always tells me to let him know when I need help. I wasn't understanding the last part of the assignment but this man took it step by step with me and explained how each part worked without quite telling me the answer. It was so hot hearing him talk about something he's so knowledgable and experienced with and never making me feel dumb or like I'm lesser than. He's a great teacher. He's so kind. I felt so lucky in that moment that the stars aligned and we got to meet. Sorry y'all, I had to spill the beans to someone, since my sister is the only one who knows about him and I can't quite tell her he made me cum four different times today.",

We reconnected, platonic, she is out of the game, we are crazy close, like best friends. We even have a startup we built together that is growing and close to turning a profit.\n\nMy point is, an arrangement can be an amazing experience if done right. Anyway my 2 cents; glad you found a good one.",
