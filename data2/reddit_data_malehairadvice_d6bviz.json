If you have a widows peak there\u2019s no way you could copy the look closely. \n\n\nYou need to get someone to use clippers on the top your head at maybe a 4 to start and then go smaller afterwards if once brushing it forward doesn\u2019t produce something closer to the desired pic. The sides idk you haven\u2019t posted it. Probably no chance at fade since it looks like they buzzed off all the side instead of a crescent fade along the side of the head along 3 inches down the head. Maybe I am wrong but it seems like you could still get a close haircut.",
