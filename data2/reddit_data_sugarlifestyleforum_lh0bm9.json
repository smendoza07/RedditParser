    "body": "Found this place a few months ago, I\u2019ve had some great conversations with members, had a ton of feedback, and finally jumped in the pool. Set up my SA profile last week after looking at reviews and suggestions here. Within 30 mins my shit was blowing up, it\u2019s like they could smell the fresh blood \ud83e\udd88 lol set up a few M&Gs, got blew off a time or two, no sweat right? Just keep going. \n\nAnd then, I fucking found him. I FOUND him!! Excuse the shouty caps, but this man. My lord this man. Digital chemistry has been 200%. His hustle matches my hustle. We texted, exchanged snaps, FaceTimed, called, the works. He was out of town when we first started talking and cut his trip short to come home and have dinner with me tonight. I hope you won\u2019t mind, but we are about to take over the world together \ud83d\ude06 \n\nFor new SBs, I just want to say, don\u2019t be so intimidated. I\u2019m an alpha female, I\u2019m not made for a weak man, I talk back, I take charge, I make decisions. I\u2019m covered in tattoos. I have a vanilla SO. I legit thought the odds were stacked against me. And some might say, yeah they are, but that\u2019s because that someone wasn\u2019t the one for me and that\u2019s ok. There is a SD out there that wants to scoop your ass up and treat you exactly how you deserve and all the bullshit that you\u2019re worrying about won\u2019t even matter. Use your common sense, have transparency, and I promise you\u2019ll find him.",

            "body": ">  I\u2019m an alpha female,\n\nWhile I think many SDs like submissive women, I have a general impression that there are plenty of us for whom that isn't a requirement.  I love me an alpha female.  I love the general dynamics of how we interact, I often enjoy finding myself helping a young alpha woman transition from a sith lord for whom her personality often creates conflict with others, to a jedi who can inspire loyalty instead.   Plus she might be a bit much for many younger men, so the ease with which we vibe is often extra appreciated.",

In fact, the women who seem to genuinely enjoy being submissive are very strong, independent, Alpha females that have the confidence to let themselves be vulnerable to someone they trust.  Earning the trust of a strong woman is a major turn on, because I know few can meet, or are willing to accept, the challenge.",
