Imagine if you or I had fucking HIV or herpes?! how terrible would that end just because you don\u2019t like the feeling of using a condom? \n\nIM TIRED OF THESE FOOLS!!! \ud83d\ude12",

I'm like, \"No! We need a condom!\" I was kind of appalled that he assumed it was okay to just go in without a condom, and if he does it this easily with me, then I'm sure he's gone bare with anyone that would let him! His first response was, \"There's no way I can get you pregnant,\" alluding to a vasectomy. I'm like, uhhh, what about STDs?! It's like in spite of being highly educated, often having multiple degrees, men play this oblivious card when it comes to that. \n\nThis is also right after we had told each other that we have other partners at dinner and that he also confessed he used to fuck a different girl every night in his earlier years on SA. \n\n>Imagine if you or I had fucking HIV or herpes?!\n\nThese aren't even my main concern; What men often fail to realize is that they can easily be carriers of HPV (most adults have some strain of it, and they typically exhibit no symptoms in men) and some strains can cause cervical cancer. I'm in my mid 30s which means I had just missed the Gardasil vaccine being popularized and covered under insurance. As we all know, cancer ain't no joke. Sorry guys, but I'm not willing to risk cervical cancer for your pleasure.\n\nIt's not just my own health I'm watching out for, it's his too! I could have an STD and his blatant disregard for condom usage shows he doesn't even care about his own health.\n\nI realize some of you guys grew up in a different time. I realize some of you have been married for 30+ years and are no longer intimate with your wives, but PLEASE, have some fucking respect for your own health, the health of your female partners who have many decades of life left and who will be affected by STDs far worse than you ever will simply because STDs typically show no symptoms in men, and have some respect for science and knowledge. With everything we know now about STDs, the incurability of viruses, and the prevention of STD transmission, stop playing dumb and respect the facts.",

People think as long as they wear a condom they are safe, that kind of blind misplaced optimism is a good way to increase risk. You're right that abstinence is the only \"sure thing\" here. Oddly enough science and the Catholic Church are more in agreement here than either is comfortable admitting. In reality we are all accepting risk when we engage in intimate activities. Understanding and managing that risk matters, condoms can be part of that but they don't replace regular testing and health care.",

Good example - SDs don't have to show their faces until the m&g ( I usually don't).  SBs generally do or have to have a liberal assortment of body pics to compensate for a lack of face picture.  \n\nThat said, I think it's irresponsible to NOT use protection, for the SDs own health.

A guy with no STIs isn't giving you one.\n\nAnd a guy who can't cum in a condom and is in his 40s or 50s? Well, that's just life. Does everyone get affected that way? No, of course not.

Any rational person would realize that. Unless of course either both parties are tested (or major trust is involved), and or the pill or IUD is used (or vasectomy etc...). Otherwise it just common sense. \n\nThe guys that get all pissy about condom usage are probably the guys who out of everyone should certainly wear them. Risky behavior. Also, I find that particular thing to sound very much like they just are in it for the sex and nothing else. \n\nCondoms suck. Even good ones. All guys know that.

I can't even imagine fighting over insurance for this bullshit when it's an uphill battle for little shit like asthma medication and blood tests sometimes. With insurance these days, a fucking diarrhea is life ending. So it's not a myth. Closer to reality than most people believe.",

But skills in bed matter. To provide myself as an example: I recently met with three women over the course of a few days. All three seem like great people, with a lot of positives. But one of them touched me in ways that I really liked. I don't have time to date around, so she's the one I'm focusing on. I sent the other two $100 each and said thanks very much for meeting me, my apologies, best wishes.",

Oddly enough science and the Catholic Church are more in agreement here than either is comfortable admitting. In reality we are all accepting risk when we engage in intimate activities. Understanding and managing that risk matters, condoms can be part of that but they don't replace regular testing and health care.",

Good example - SDs don't have to show their faces until the m&g ( I usually don't).  SBs generally do or have to have a liberal assortment of body pics to compensate for a lack of face picture.  \n\nThat said, I think it's irresponsible to NOT use protection, for the SDs own health.

I can't even imagine fighting over insurance for this bullshit when it's an uphill battle for little shit like asthma medication and blood tests sometimes. With insurance these days, a fucking diarrhea is life ending. So it's not a myth. Closer to reality than most people believe.",

Oddly enough science and the Catholic Church are more in agreement here than either is comfortable admitting. In reality we are all accepting risk when we engage in intimate activities. Understanding and managing that risk matters, condoms can be part of that but they don't replace regular testing and health care.",

I can't even imagine fighting over insurance for this bullshit when it's an uphill battle for little shit like asthma medication and blood tests sometimes. With insurance these days, a fucking diarrhea is life ending. So it's not a myth. Closer to reality than most people believe.",

People think as long as they wear a condom they are safe, that kind of blind misplaced optimism is a good way to increase risk. You're right that abstinence is the only \"sure thing\" here. Oddly enough science and the Catholic Church are more in agreement here than either is comfortable admitting. In reality we are all accepting risk when we engage in intimate activities. Understanding and managing that risk matters, condoms can be part of that but they don't replace regular testing and health care.",

I can't even imagine fighting over insurance for this bullshit when it's an uphill battle for little shit like asthma medication and blood tests sometimes. With insurance these days, a fucking diarrhea is life ending. So it's not a myth. Closer to reality than most people believe.",

People think as long as they wear a condom they are safe, that kind of blind misplaced optimism is a good way to increase risk. You're right that abstinence is the only \"sure thing\" here. Oddly enough science and the Catholic Church are more in agreement here than either is comfortable admitting. In reality we are all accepting risk when we engage in intimate activities. Understanding and managing that risk matters, condoms can be part of that but they don't replace regular testing and health care.",

I can't even imagine fighting over insurance for this bullshit when it's an uphill battle for little shit like asthma medication and blood tests sometimes. With insurance these days, a fucking diarrhea is life ending. So it's not a myth. Closer to reality than most people believe.",

Safety class in bondage, also in impact play (for your safety or his, it's very common to experiment with at the very least). Very clear understanding of yourself and what you enjoy, and how to ask for it in a clear and supportive way.\n\nOne way to minimize the chance of one-offs is for the guy to think, \"Oh my god that was amazing, and I've barely scratched the surface.\"\n\nPersonality, confidence, overall connection, are still important -- probably more important, but depends on the guy. But skills in bed matter. To provide myself as an example: I recently met with three women over the course of a few days. All three seem like great people, with a lot of positives. But one of them touched me in ways that I really liked. I don't have time to date around, so she's the one I'm focusing on. I sent the other two $100 each and said thanks very much for meeting me, my apologies, best wishes.",

I can't even imagine fighting over insurance for this bullshit when it's an uphill battle for little shit like asthma medication and blood tests sometimes. With insurance these days, a fucking diarrhea is life ending. So it's not a myth. Closer to reality than most people believe.",

I can't even imagine fighting over insurance for this bullshit when it's an uphill battle for little shit like asthma medication and blood tests sometimes. With insurance these days, a fucking diarrhea is life ending. So it's not a myth. Closer to reality than most people believe.",

That's a dangerous myth.\n\nOne slip up and you're fucked with HIV. Not something i really want to deal with. Also if you don't have the funds it is life ending, if you do it's wallet busting. I can't even imagine fighting over insurance for this bullshit when it's an uphill battle for little shit like asthma medication and blood tests sometimes. With insurance these days, a fucking diarrhea is life ending. So it's not a myth. Closer to reality than most people believe.",
