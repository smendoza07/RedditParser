When will he stop? \n  \nAn afterthought that I hope won't offend: \nI don't mind seeing Instagram posts but I would much rather see clips of the members from present or past episodes or even pictures related to RM episodes. I think more varied comments can be made by a wider group of RM fans that way. Endless comments on looks or excessive praise just comes across as superficial after a while and I can understand why it annoys some people. Surely the RM ladies deserve to be seen as more than just eye candy. I've noticed recently SNS reposts annoys a lot of people. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
