That shot specifically is from the episode before when its first introduced, when they didn't have the budget to go all out with the color design and shading. I've been rewatching Naruto and Shippuden and that show has some real ugly episodes, purely because its an anime coming out on a weekly basis, so the budget needs to be spread out a lot thinner, rather than seasonal, like a lot of anime coming out now. Its quite literally not the animators' fault.",

Something that outlines every single arc, first things first stating manga or anime filler. Then a brief synopsis of each arc, listing its length and \"worth it\" factor (quality vs. length), as well as key episodes or fights to watch in case its an anime-only arc you want to skip. Overall highlighting the \"must-watch\", \"watch if you want\", \"watch x episodes of\" and \"you might want to skip this\" arcs.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHell, I might even one day make this guide myself, if I ever find the free time to do it.",

In the 4th great ninja war we get a flashback of how obito dies, in the middle of him dying (not the rock, but getting killed by Kaguya as he is disintegrating).\n\nThere are the same repetitive flashbacks in every episode, all of that is filler.  I know more people watch then read, but if you had read the manga first the anime is borderline unwatchable.",

In the 4th great ninja war we get a flashback of how obito dies, in the middle of him dying (not the rock, but getting killed by Kaguya as he is disintegrating).\n\nThere are the same repetitive flashbacks in every episode, all of that is filler.  I know more people watch then read, but if you had read the manga first the anime is borderline unwatchable.",

In the 4th great ninja war we get a flashback of how obito dies, in the middle of him dying (not the rock, but getting killed by Kaguya as he is disintegrating).\n\nThere are the same repetitive flashbacks in every episode, all of that is filler.  I know more people watch then read, but if you had read the manga first the anime is borderline unwatchable.",

And since Naruto is Naruto he needs to use more chakra to make a clone. It's just that Kuruma has so incredibly much chakra that that amount isn't enough of his being to take over.",
