    "body": "I wrote a post about having 3 M&G\u2019s in one day so I\u2019d figure I\u2019d share about how today went. \n\nPOT: #1: was shocked in a good way. I forgot he was diamond but he gave me a full ppm (wasn\u2019t even discussed but It was the most I have ever gotten) had a beautiful condo, was able to be platonic, was so generous and I felt so lucky being there. Hoping for future dates and he really liked me. \n\nPOT #2: confirmed this morning then ghosted while I was on my way. Got there and nothing. Got coffee and ended up seeing a friend who was visiting from overseas.I was annoyed that he couldn\u2019t respect me enough to tell me but I moved on. \n\nPOT #3. Was under half my allowance expectations. Both of us said our farewells and good lucks and he thanked me for being classy. \n\nHopefully I caught the eye of my first POT. drove over an hour and definitely did pay off. Can\u2019t wait for the future. He\u2019s already discussing future dates. \n\nJust wanted to share how today went :). Some good and some bad but overall I would consider it a win.",

The 3rd pot didn\u2019t share the same allowance expectations, but that can be avoided by having that discussion beforehand honestly. I really hope your 1st pot works out! I love hearing about great M&Gs. Good luck!",

She didn't provide too many details and I didn't feel I had any right to influence what she elected to do, and I thought it would be fine, realizing I was in somewhat of a special status of GF/SB and not being able to make up for the lost revenue she would incur if she took a new direction with me as her only SD, but it soon became a source of some irritation that she didn't have time for me because the endless need for more $ from others took precedence.  So I was wondering if multiple SDs and one-night-stand clients is a routine occurrence among SB practices or something else entirely.",

She didn't provide too many details and I didn't feel I had any right to influence what she elected to do, and I thought it would be fine, realizing I was in somewhat of a special status of GF/SB and not being able to make up for the lost revenue she would incur if she took a new direction with me as her only SD, but it soon became a source of some irritation that she didn't have time for me because the endless need for more $ from others took precedence.  So I was wondering if multiple SDs and one-night-stand clients is a routine occurrence among SB practices or something else entirely.",
