    "body": "Just a little safety reminder... Even wealthy well known men are in sex trafficking. Many here will debate that it's a low risk when in reality it's a higher risk then what people would like to admit. \n\nSBs are easy prey as they can be easy to groom and manipulate... Even blackmailed.\n\nYou're at higher risk if: \n\nYou have a low self esteem.\n\nSuffer from depression, anxiety, ptsd\n\nYou have a history of trauma\n\nYou are co-dependent\n\nYou are alone (no nearby family, little to no friends,etc)\n\nYou are not a US Citizen\n\nYou have no children or significant other (or if you do they may be well cared for by other family)\n\nYou don't live with family or friends\n\nYou're struggling financially\n\nYou have an addiction or are prone to an addiction\n\n\nYour SD maybe a trafficker IF:\n\nHe love bombs you\n\nOver abundant with gifts and money\n\nIntroduces you to drugs or forces you to do drugs\n\nBegins to isolate you\n\nBegins to emotionally abuse and blackmail you\n\nMakes you feel weak\n\nControlling, violent and unstable\n\nTakes your consent away\n\nPushes you into sexual scenarios with others you ordinarily wouldn't do (threesomes, gang bangs, swinging etc.) \n\nEven IF your \"SD\" isn't trafficking you, it's still domestic violence. \n\nI am speaking as a victim. My ex vanilla bf who had pimped me out at events and parties without my consent or even knowledge. I only found out after I left him when he caught a rape case. He too was a well known affluent govt official. \n\nTrafficking can be very subtle. \n\nIf you suspect you are or might be either a victim of domestic abuse or trafficking these hotlines can help save your life or the life of a loved one....\n\nNational Human Trafficking Hotline:\n1-888-373-7888\n\nThe National Domestic Violence Hotline:\n1-800-799-7233",

            "body": "The most troubling thing to me about guys like Epstine (also applies to rich/athlete kids who face date rape charges) is how much the system protects and shields them from just consequences for their abhorrent behavior because of their privilege. I don't get it, do the judges identify with them because they were rapists in their wild days too? This scumbag had 10 more mulligan years of abusing women (and girls) because they didn't throw the book at him the first time. Thanks for putting your thoughts and those phone #'s for resources out there, OP. At first I was wondering why this was posted on SLF, but there are clearly some vulnerable among the SB population and hopefully they see this. Be safe and be kind y'all.",

That's why President Donald Trump appointed Alexander Acosta, the US Attorney who approved the \"kid \\[so to speak\\] gloves treatment\" plea deal with Epstein, to his cabinet. Trump was rewarding Acosta for protecting Bill Clinton because he loves the Clintons so much. As you know, Trump and his supporters yell \"WE LOVE BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON\" at all their rallies. (... lol)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I\u2019m also not sure how they are prosecuting him today.  This would seem like double jeopardy.\n\nI'm sure the new charges \"seem\" like double jeopardy to Epstein's defense attorneys. The prosecutors will argue that the new charges are for crimes that were not previously charged, and hence not covered by the plea deal. Federal judges at some level, possibly the Supreme Court, will make the ultimate decision on whether the new charges are allowed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand this is interesting too ...\n\n[https://twitter.com/gtconway3d/status/1147843633397284864](https://twitter.com/gtconway3d/status/1147843633397284864)",

Just because someone thinks sugaring is sex work doesn't mean that they are an escort. There are many SDs here who think sugaring is sex work, but they don't assume themselves or the SBs they see to be escorts and/or johns.\n\nIn RussianAsshole's example, in the past year she's never self identified as an escort. If she did before, I didn't scroll that far back. She posted in SexWorkersOnly, but that sub has cam girls, strippers, and sugar babies in it. She has posts saying [other SBs](https://old.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/9vkyhi/nyc_pot_who_refuses_to_take_the_subway/e9envcm/) indicating that she herself is one, but I couldn't find anything from her saying \"other escorts\" or \"other prostitutes\". The only thing I could find in the last year even vaguely alluding to it was a comment about why [escorting is better than sugaring.](https://old.reddit.com/r/SexWorkersOnly/comments/9ym6qa/whats_the_deal_with_sds/ea2smgj/)\n\nSo clearly, it isn't *just* when they're \"Self proclaimed\".

It's a direct copy and paste. \n\n> Totallynotanescort deleted all of her post history, but you can still see that she posted to the SexWorkersOnly reddit. \n\nOkay, so once again: just because someone posts there doesn't explicitly make them an escort. \n\nYou were supplied comments and scenarios where you ONCE AGAIN started escort shaming someone who has never said they were an escort. If totallynotanescort *said* she was? Who cares. You already know rule 12 so check your behavior. The mods have already stated that comparisons aren't welcome, and that escorts are free to post here so long as no comparisons between the escort job and their sugaring is mentioned.\n\nCalling out your bullshit isn't being obtuse. Its supplying facts where you keep *saying* things happened or were said, but the post history is proof that it didn't.  So either you need to go to a doctor to get your memory checked, you need to go to a neurologist for dyslexia, or you are trolling and pot stirring for no reason. \n\n\nAlso I have no idea how saying [\"women age like milk\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/SugarDatingForum/comments/bufq17/congratulations/epdxv5x)  or that [women can't attract high calibur men at 30 because their \"looks have faded\" \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/c44lf7/input_needed/eruw4yb) isnt gender bashing. Neither of these comments were made in response to gender bashing so don't even try.",

Read slowly out loud and ask for an adult to help you when you get stuck or the reading becomes too difficult for you.\n\nLet me know if I need to go get my crayons and draw pictures for you. \n\n1) you claimed you only call people escorts who are self identified. \n\n2) I prove this isn't the case as RussianAsshole has never called herself an escort or prostitute, yet you have accused of her such simply because of a sub she posts in. \n\n3)  Updated rule 12 says no comparing of SLF SBs to escorts. If RussianAsshole has never said she is one, how can she be \"self identified\"? Furthermore, [the extended rules have the admins agreeing that SBs can be escorts and escorts can be SBs but to leave all talk or comparisons at the door.](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/bisfdf/calcification_for_rule_12/em3kwwf)The update specific said, from the mods as represented by /u/malibijones\n\n> Going forward the Mods will be more aggressive with enforcing rule #12. If we see posts promoting sexworkers, **comparing SBs to Escorts, bringing up Escorts for the hell of it (examples list above)** we will remove the post. If we see the OP **is/was attempting to stir the pot**, side step the rule or ignore it we will ban the poster without warning. \n\n> Promoting the lifestyle, pushing $$ amounts, **bringing up Escorts for the hell of it, using the term to attack/shame/compare with someone else.**\n\nSo yeah. Given that the users you \"called out for being escorts since they are self proclaimed\" weren't even talking about escorting---**you** brought it up in an attempt to discredit whatever they were saying to begin with. And in the case of RussianAsshole, she is not \"self proclaimed\". You said it 1) as an attack and 2) when comparisons aren't welcome to begin with. She has nothing in her post history in the last year admitting to escorting. The rules don't say \"escorts can't post and their opinions aren't valid or welcome.\" The rule says as long as they dont compare it they're fine. None of the people you've listed have posted in SLF about their escorting experience--you are always the one to bring it up in an attempt to discredit them.

I saw *you* tell her she should seek help because of her past. I saw her say you must have some guilt if you are so vehemently against people protecting themselves against sex trafficking. If you took offense, that's on you, but I do not see any actual personal attacks from her. Only from you. From someone who uses the term snowflake a lot you sure seem to miss the irony.",

That's why President Donald Trump appointed Alexander Acosta, the US Attorney who approved the \"kid \\[so to speak\\] gloves treatment\" plea deal with Epstein, to his cabinet. Trump was rewarding Acosta for protecting Bill Clinton because he loves the Clintons so much. As you know, Trump and his supporters yell \"WE LOVE BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON\" at all their rallies. (... lol)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I\u2019m also not sure how they are prosecuting him today.  This would seem like double jeopardy.\n\nI'm sure the new charges \"seem\" like double jeopardy to Epstein's defense attorneys. The prosecutors will argue that the new charges are for crimes that were not previously charged, and hence not covered by the plea deal. Federal judges at some level, possibly the Supreme Court, will make the ultimate decision on whether the new charges are allowed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand this is interesting too ...\n\n[https://twitter.com/gtconway3d/status/1147843633397284864](https://twitter.com/gtconway3d/status/1147843633397284864)",

Just because someone thinks sugaring is sex work doesn't mean that they are an escort. There are many SDs here who think sugaring is sex work, but they don't assume themselves or the SBs they see to be escorts and/or johns.\n\nIn RussianAsshole's example, in the past year she's never self identified as an escort. If she did before, I didn't scroll that far back. She posted in SexWorkersOnly, but that sub has cam girls, strippers, and sugar babies in it. She has posts saying [other SBs](https://old.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/9vkyhi/nyc_pot_who_refuses_to_take_the_subway/e9envcm/) indicating that she herself is one, but I couldn't find anything from her saying \"other escorts\" or \"other prostitutes\". The only thing I could find in the last year even vaguely alluding to it was a comment about why [escorting is better than sugaring.](https://old.reddit.com/r/SexWorkersOnly/comments/9ym6qa/whats_the_deal_with_sds/ea2smgj/)\n\nSo clearly, it isn't *just* when they're \"Self proclaimed\".

If totallynotanescort *said* she was? Who cares. You already know rule 12 so check your behavior. The mods have already stated that comparisons aren't welcome, and that escorts are free to post here so long as no comparisons between the escort job and their sugaring is mentioned.\n\nCalling out your bullshit isn't being obtuse. Its supplying facts where you keep *saying* things happened or were said, but the post history is proof that it didn't.  So either you need to go to a doctor to get your memory checked, you need to go to a neurologist for dyslexia, or you are trolling and pot stirring for no reason. \n\n\nAlso I have no idea how saying [\"women age like milk\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/SugarDatingForum/comments/bufq17/congratulations/epdxv5x)  or that [women can't attract high calibur men at 30 because their \"looks have faded\" \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/c44lf7/input_needed/eruw4yb) isnt gender bashing.

Read slowly out loud and ask for an adult to help you when you get stuck or the reading becomes too difficult for you.\n\nLet me know if I need to go get my crayons and draw pictures for you. \n\n1) you claimed you only call people escorts who are self identified. \n\n2) I prove this isn't the case as RussianAsshole has never called herself an escort or prostitute, yet you have accused of her such simply because of a sub she posts in. \n\n3)  Updated rule 12 says no comparing of SLF SBs to escorts. If RussianAsshole has never said she is one, how can she be \"self identified\"? Furthermore, [the extended rules have the admins agreeing that SBs can be escorts and escorts can be SBs but to leave all talk or comparisons at the door.](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/bisfdf/calcification_for_rule_12/em3kwwf)The update specific said, from the mods as represented by /u/malibijones\n\n> Going forward the Mods will be more aggressive with enforcing rule #12. If we see posts promoting sexworkers, **comparing SBs to Escorts, bringing up Escorts for the hell of it (examples list above)** we will remove the post. If we see the OP **is/was attempting to stir the pot**, side step the rule or ignore it we will ban the poster without warning. \n\n> Promoting the lifestyle, pushing $$ amounts, **bringing up Escorts for the hell of it, using the term to attack/shame/compare with someone else.**\n\nSo yeah. Given that the users you \"called out for being escorts since they are self proclaimed\" weren't even talking about escorting---**you** brought it up in an attempt to discredit whatever they were saying to begin with. And in the case of RussianAsshole, she is not \"self proclaimed\". You said it 1) as an attack and 2) when comparisons aren't welcome to begin with. She has nothing in her post history in the last year admitting to escorting. The rules don't say \"escorts can't post and their opinions aren't valid or welcome.\" The rule says as long as they dont compare it they're fine. None of the people you've listed have posted in SLF about their escorting experience--you are always the one to bring it up in an attempt to discredit them. So yes, *multiple* violations of rule 12 since the clarification.",

You can try to make me look bad all you want but some of us are aware of the dangers and realities within the bowl.\n\n> If it really irks you then you must have some sort of guilt, etc to work through.\n\nWhat personal attack did she make? I saw *you* tell her she should seek help because of her past. I saw her say you must have some guilt if you are so vehemently against people protecting themselves against sex trafficking. If you took offense, that's on you, but I do not see any actual personal attacks from her. Only from you. From someone who uses the term snowflake a lot you sure seem to miss the irony.",

That's why President Donald Trump appointed Alexander Acosta, the US Attorney who approved the \"kid \\[so to speak\\] gloves treatment\" plea deal with Epstein, to his cabinet. Trump was rewarding Acosta for protecting Bill Clinton because he loves the Clintons so much. As you know, Trump and his supporters yell \"WE LOVE BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON\" at all their rallies. (... lol)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I\u2019m also not sure how they are prosecuting him today.  This would seem like double jeopardy.\n\nI'm sure the new charges \"seem\" like double jeopardy to Epstein's defense attorneys. The prosecutors will argue that the new charges are for crimes that were not previously charged, and hence not covered by the plea deal. Federal judges at some level, possibly the Supreme Court, will make the ultimate decision on whether the new charges are allowed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand this is interesting too ...\n\n[https://twitter.com/gtconway3d/status/1147843633397284864](https://twitter.com/gtconway3d/status/1147843633397284864)",

Just because someone thinks sugaring is sex work doesn't mean that they are an escort. There are many SDs here who think sugaring is sex work, but they don't assume themselves or the SBs they see to be escorts and/or johns.\n\nIn RussianAsshole's example, in the past year she's never self identified as an escort. If she did before, I didn't scroll that far back. She posted in SexWorkersOnly, but that sub has cam girls, strippers, and sugar babies in it. She has posts saying [other SBs](https://old.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/9vkyhi/nyc_pot_who_refuses_to_take_the_subway/e9envcm/) indicating that she herself is one, but I couldn't find anything from her saying \"other escorts\" or \"other prostitutes\". The only thing I could find in the last year even vaguely alluding to it was a comment about why [escorting is better than sugaring.](https://old.reddit.com/r/SexWorkersOnly/comments/9ym6qa/whats_the_deal_with_sds/ea2smgj/)\n\nSo clearly, it isn't *just* when they're \"Self proclaimed\". Thank you for proving my point that you only call others escorts when they don't fit your mold.",

If totallynotanescort *said* she was? Who cares. You already know rule 12 so check your behavior. The mods have already stated that comparisons aren't welcome, and that escorts are free to post here so long as no comparisons between the escort job and their sugaring is mentioned.\n\nCalling out your bullshit isn't being obtuse. Its supplying facts where you keep *saying* things happened or were said, but the post history is proof that it didn't.  So either you need to go to a doctor to get your memory checked, you need to go to a neurologist for dyslexia, or you are trolling and pot stirring for no reason. \n\n\nAlso I have no idea how saying [\"women age like milk\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/SugarDatingForum/comments/bufq17/congratulations/epdxv5x)  or that [women can't attract high calibur men at 30 because their \"looks have faded\" \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/c44lf7/input_needed/eruw4yb) isnt gender bashing.

Read slowly out loud and ask for an adult to help you when you get stuck or the reading becomes too difficult for you.\n\nLet me know if I need to go get my crayons and draw pictures for you. \n\n1) you claimed you only call people escorts who are self identified. \n\n2) I prove this isn't the case as RussianAsshole has never called herself an escort or prostitute, yet you have accused of her such simply because of a sub she posts in. \n\n3)  Updated rule 12 says no comparing of SLF SBs to escorts. If RussianAsshole has never said she is one, how can she be \"self identified\"? Furthermore, [the extended rules have the admins agreeing that SBs can be escorts and escorts can be SBs but to leave all talk or comparisons at the door.](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/bisfdf/calcification_for_rule_12/em3kwwf)The update specific said, from the mods as represented by /u/malibijones\n\n> Going forward the Mods will be more aggressive with enforcing rule #12. If we see posts promoting sexworkers, **comparing SBs to Escorts, bringing up Escorts for the hell of it (examples list above)** we will remove the post. If we see the OP **is/was attempting to stir the pot**, side step the rule or ignore it we will ban the poster without warning. \n\n> Promoting the lifestyle, pushing $$ amounts, **bringing up Escorts for the hell of it, using the term to attack/shame/compare with someone else.**\n\nSo yeah. Given that the users you \"called out for being escorts since they are self proclaimed\" weren't even talking about escorting---**you** brought it up in an attempt to discredit whatever they were saying to begin with. And in the case of RussianAsshole, she is not \"self proclaimed\". You said it 1) as an attack and 2) when comparisons aren't welcome to begin with. She has nothing in her post history in the last year admitting to escorting. The rules don't say \"escorts can't post and their opinions aren't valid or welcome.\" The rule says as long as they dont compare it they're fine. None of the people you've listed have posted in SLF about their escorting experience--you are always the one to bring it up in an attempt to discredit them. So yes, *multiple* violations of rule 12 since the clarification.",

I saw *you* tell her she should seek help because of her past. I saw her say you must have some guilt if you are so vehemently against people protecting themselves against sex trafficking. If you took offense, that's on you, but I do not see any actual personal attacks from her. Only from you. From someone who uses the term snowflake a lot you sure seem to miss the irony.",

Just because someone thinks sugaring is sex work doesn't mean that they are an escort.

If she did before, I didn't scroll that far back. She posted in SexWorkersOnly, but that sub has cam girls, strippers, and sugar babies in it. She has posts saying [other SBs](https://old.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/9vkyhi/nyc_pot_who_refuses_to_take_the_subway/e9envcm/) indicating that she herself is one, but I couldn't find anything from her saying \"other escorts\" or \"other prostitutes\".

It's a direct copy and paste. \n\n> Totallynotanescort deleted all of her post history, but you can still see that she posted to the SexWorkersOnly reddit. \n\nOkay, so once again: just because someone posts there doesn't explicitly make them an escort. \n\nYou were supplied comments and scenarios where you ONCE AGAIN started escort shaming someone who has never said they were an escort. If totallynotanescort *said* she was? Who cares. You already know rule 12 so check your behavior. The mods have already stated that comparisons aren't welcome, and that escorts are free to post here so long as no comparisons between the escort job and their sugaring is mentioned.\n\nCalling out your bullshit isn't being obtuse. Its supplying facts where you keep *saying* things happened or were said, but the post history is proof that it didn't.  So either you need to go to a doctor to get your memory checked, you need to go to a neurologist for dyslexia, or you are trolling and pot stirring for no reason. \n\n\nAlso I have no idea how saying [\"women age like milk\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/SugarDatingForum/comments/bufq17/congratulations/epdxv5x)  or that [women can't attract high calibur men at 30 because their \"looks have faded\" \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/c44lf7/input_needed/eruw4yb) isnt gender bashing. Neither of these comments were made in response to gender bashing so don't even try.",

Read slowly out loud and ask for an adult to help you when you get stuck or the reading becomes too difficult for you.\n\nLet me know if I need to go get my crayons and draw pictures for you. \n\n1) you claimed you only call people escorts who are self identified. \n\n2) I prove this isn't the case as RussianAsshole has never called herself an escort or prostitute, yet you have accused of her such simply because of a sub she posts in. \n\n3)  Updated rule 12 says no comparing of SLF SBs to escorts. If RussianAsshole has never said she is one, how can she be \"self identified\"? Furthermore, [the extended rules have the admins agreeing that SBs can be escorts and escorts can be SBs but to leave all talk or comparisons at the door.](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/bisfdf/calcification_for_rule_12/em3kwwf)The update specific said, from the mods as represented by /u/malibijones\n\n> Going forward the Mods will be more aggressive with enforcing rule #12. If we see posts promoting sexworkers, **comparing SBs to Escorts, bringing up Escorts for the hell of it (examples list above)** we will remove the post. If we see the OP **is/was attempting to stir the pot**, side step the rule or ignore it we will ban the poster without warning. \n\n> Promoting the lifestyle, pushing $$ amounts, **bringing up Escorts for the hell of it, using the term to attack/shame/compare with someone else.**\n\nSo yeah. Given that the users you \"called out for being escorts since they are self proclaimed\" weren't even talking about escorting---**you** brought it up in an attempt to discredit whatever they were saying to begin with. And in the case of RussianAsshole, she is not \"self proclaimed\". You said it 1) as an attack and 2) when comparisons aren't welcome to begin with. She has nothing in her post history in the last year admitting to escorting. The rules don't say \"escorts can't post and their opinions aren't valid or welcome.\" The rule says as long as they dont compare it they're fine. None of the people you've listed have posted in SLF about their escorting experience--you are always the one to bring it up in an attempt to discredit them. So yes, *multiple* violations of rule 12 since the clarification.",

You can try to make me look bad all you want but some of us are aware of the dangers and realities within the bowl.\n\n> If it really irks you then you must have some sort of guilt, etc to work through.\n\nWhat personal attack did she make? I saw *you* tell her she should seek help because of her past. I saw her say you must have some guilt if you are so vehemently against people protecting themselves against sex trafficking. If you took offense, that's on you, but I do not see any actual personal attacks from her. Only from you. From someone who uses the term snowflake a lot you sure seem to miss the irony.",

Just because someone thinks sugaring is sex work doesn't mean that they are an escort. There are many SDs here who think sugaring is sex work, but they don't assume themselves or the SBs they see to be escorts and/or johns.\n\nIn RussianAsshole's example, in the past year she's never self identified as an escort. If she did before, I didn't scroll that far back. She posted in SexWorkersOnly, but that sub has cam girls, strippers, and sugar babies in it. She has posts saying [other SBs](https://old.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/9vkyhi/nyc_pot_who_refuses_to_take_the_subway/e9envcm/) indicating that she herself is one, but I couldn't find anything from her saying \"other escorts\" or \"other prostitutes\". The only thing I could find in the last year even vaguely alluding to it was a comment about why [escorting is better than sugaring.](https://old.reddit.com/r/SexWorkersOnly/comments/9ym6qa/whats_the_deal_with_sds/ea2smgj/)\n\nSo clearly, it isn't *just* when they're \"Self proclaimed\".

If totallynotanescort *said* she was? Who cares. You already know rule 12 so check your behavior. The mods have already stated that comparisons aren't welcome, and that escorts are free to post here so long as no comparisons between the escort job and their sugaring is mentioned.\n\nCalling out your bullshit isn't being obtuse. Its supplying facts where you keep *saying* things happened or were said, but the post history is proof that it didn't.  So either you need to go to a doctor to get your memory checked, you need to go to a neurologist for dyslexia, or you are trolling and pot stirring for no reason. \n\n\nAlso I have no idea how saying [\"women age like milk\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/SugarDatingForum/comments/bufq17/congratulations/epdxv5x)  or that [women can't attract high calibur men at 30 because their \"looks have faded\" \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/c44lf7/input_needed/eruw4yb) isnt gender bashing.

If RussianAsshole has never said she is one, how can she be \"self identified\"? Furthermore, [the extended rules have the admins agreeing that SBs can be escorts and escorts can be SBs but to leave all talk or comparisons at the door.](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/bisfdf/calcification_for_rule_12/em3kwwf)The update specific said, from the mods as represented by /u/malibijones\n\n> Going forward the Mods will be more aggressive with enforcing rule #12. If we see posts promoting sexworkers, **comparing SBs to Escorts, bringing up Escorts for the hell of it (examples list above)** we will remove the post. If we see the OP **is/was attempting to stir the pot**, side step the rule or ignore it we will ban the poster without warning. \n\n> Promoting the lifestyle, pushing $$ amounts, **bringing up Escorts for the hell of it, using the term to attack/shame/compare with someone else.**\n\nSo yeah. Given that the users you \"called out for being escorts since they are self proclaimed\" weren't even talking about escorting---**you** brought it up in an attempt to discredit whatever they were saying to begin with. And in the case of RussianAsshole, she is not \"self proclaimed\". You said it 1) as an attack and 2) when comparisons aren't welcome to begin with. She has nothing in her post history in the last year admitting to escorting. The rules don't say \"escorts can't post and their opinions aren't valid or welcome.\" The rule says as long as they dont compare it they're fine. None of the people you've listed have posted in SLF about their escorting experience--you are always the one to bring it up in an attempt to discredit them. So yes, *multiple* violations of rule 12 since the clarification.",

You can try to make me look bad all you want but some of us are aware of the dangers and realities within the bowl.\n\n> If it really irks you then you must have some sort of guilt, etc to work through.\n\nWhat personal attack did she make? I saw *you* tell her she should seek help because of her past. I saw her say you must have some guilt if you are so vehemently against people protecting themselves against sex trafficking. If you took offense, that's on you, but I do not see any actual personal attacks from her. Only from you. From someone who uses the term snowflake a lot you sure seem to miss the irony.",

It's a direct copy and paste. \n\n> Totallynotanescort deleted all of her post history, but you can still see that she posted to the SexWorkersOnly reddit. \n\nOkay, so once again: just because someone posts there doesn't explicitly make them an escort. \n\nYou were supplied comments and scenarios where you ONCE AGAIN started escort shaming someone who has never said they were an escort. If totallynotanescort *said* she was? Who cares. You already know rule 12 so check your behavior. The mods have already stated that comparisons aren't welcome, and that escorts are free to post here so long as no comparisons between the escort job and their sugaring is mentioned.\n\nCalling out your bullshit isn't being obtuse. Its supplying facts where you keep *saying* things happened or were said, but the post history is proof that it didn't.  So either you need to go to a doctor to get your memory checked, you need to go to a neurologist for dyslexia, or you are trolling and pot stirring for no reason. \n\n\nAlso I have no idea how saying [\"women age like milk\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/SugarDatingForum/comments/bufq17/congratulations/epdxv5x)  or that [women can't attract high calibur men at 30 because their \"looks have faded\" \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/c44lf7/input_needed/eruw4yb) isnt gender bashing. Neither of these comments were made in response to gender bashing so don't even try.",

Read slowly out loud and ask for an adult to help you when you get stuck or the reading becomes too difficult for you.\n\nLet me know if I need to go get my crayons and draw pictures for you. \n\n1) you claimed you only call people escorts who are self identified. \n\n2) I prove this isn't the case as RussianAsshole has never called herself an escort or prostitute, yet you have accused of her such simply because of a sub she posts in. \n\n3)  Updated rule 12 says no comparing of SLF SBs to escorts. If RussianAsshole has never said she is one, how can she be \"self identified\"? Furthermore, [the extended rules have the admins agreeing that SBs can be escorts and escorts can be SBs but to leave all talk or comparisons at the door.](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/bisfdf/calcification_for_rule_12/em3kwwf)The update specific said, from the mods as represented by /u/malibijones\n\n> Going forward the Mods will be more aggressive with enforcing rule #12. If we see posts promoting sexworkers, **comparing SBs to Escorts, bringing up Escorts for the hell of it (examples list above)** we will remove the post. If we see the OP **is/was attempting to stir the pot**, side step the rule or ignore it we will ban the poster without warning. \n\n> Promoting the lifestyle, pushing $$ amounts, **bringing up Escorts for the hell of it, using the term to attack/shame/compare with someone else.**\n\nSo yeah. Given that the users you \"called out for being escorts since they are self proclaimed\" weren't even talking about escorting---**you** brought it up in an attempt to discredit whatever they were saying to begin with. And in the case of RussianAsshole, she is not \"self proclaimed\". You said it 1) as an attack and 2) when comparisons aren't welcome to begin with. She has nothing in her post history in the last year admitting to escorting. The rules don't say \"escorts can't post and their opinions aren't valid or welcome.\" The rule says as long as they dont compare it they're fine. None of the people you've listed have posted in SLF about their escorting experience--you are always the one to bring it up in an attempt to discredit them. So yes, *multiple* violations of rule 12 since the clarification.",

I saw *you* tell her she should seek help because of her past. I saw her say you must have some guilt if you are so vehemently against people protecting themselves against sex trafficking. If you took offense, that's on you, but I do not see any actual personal attacks from her. Only from you. From someone who uses the term snowflake a lot you sure seem to miss the irony.",

It's a direct copy and paste. \n\n> Totallynotanescort deleted all of her post history, but you can still see that she posted to the SexWorkersOnly reddit. \n\nOkay, so once again: just because someone posts there doesn't explicitly make them an escort. \n\nYou were supplied comments and scenarios where you ONCE AGAIN started escort shaming someone who has never said they were an escort. If totallynotanescort *said* she was? Who cares. You already know rule 12 so check your behavior. The mods have already stated that comparisons aren't welcome, and that escorts are free to post here so long as no comparisons between the escort job and their sugaring is mentioned.\n\nCalling out your bullshit isn't being obtuse. Its supplying facts where you keep *saying* things happened or were said, but the post history is proof that it didn't.  So either you need to go to a doctor to get your memory checked, you need to go to a neurologist for dyslexia, or you are trolling and pot stirring for no reason. \n\n\nAlso I have no idea how saying [\"women age like milk\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/SugarDatingForum/comments/bufq17/congratulations/epdxv5x)  or that [women can't attract high calibur men at 30 because their \"looks have faded\" \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/c44lf7/input_needed/eruw4yb) isnt gender bashing. Neither of these comments were made in response to gender bashing so don't even try.",

Read slowly out loud and ask for an adult to help you when you get stuck or the reading becomes too difficult for you.\n\nLet me know if I need to go get my crayons and draw pictures for you. \n\n1) you claimed you only call people escorts who are self identified. \n\n2) I prove this isn't the case as RussianAsshole has never called herself an escort or prostitute, yet you have accused of her such simply because of a sub she posts in. \n\n3)  Updated rule 12 says no comparing of SLF SBs to escorts. If RussianAsshole has never said she is one, how can she be \"self identified\"? Furthermore, [the extended rules have the admins agreeing that SBs can be escorts and escorts can be SBs but to leave all talk or comparisons at the door.](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/bisfdf/calcification_for_rule_12/em3kwwf)The update specific said, from the mods as represented by /u/malibijones\n\n> Going forward the Mods will be more aggressive with enforcing rule #12. If we see posts promoting sexworkers, **comparing SBs to Escorts, bringing up Escorts for the hell of it (examples list above)** we will remove the post. If we see the OP **is/was attempting to stir the pot**, side step the rule or ignore it we will ban the poster without warning. \n\n> Promoting the lifestyle, pushing $$ amounts, **bringing up Escorts for the hell of it, using the term to attack/shame/compare with someone else.**\n\nSo yeah. Given that the users you \"called out for being escorts since they are self proclaimed\" weren't even talking about escorting---**you** brought it up in an attempt to discredit whatever they were saying to begin with. And in the case of RussianAsshole, she is not \"self proclaimed\". You said it 1) as an attack and 2) when comparisons aren't welcome to begin with. She has nothing in her post history in the last year admitting to escorting. The rules don't say \"escorts can't post and their opinions aren't valid or welcome.\" The rule says as long as they dont compare it they're fine. None of the people you've listed have posted in SLF about their escorting experience--you are always the one to bring it up in an attempt to discredit them. So yes, *multiple* violations of rule 12 since the clarification.",

I saw *you* tell her she should seek help because of her past. I saw her say you must have some guilt if you are so vehemently against people protecting themselves against sex trafficking. If you took offense, that's on you, but I do not see any actual personal attacks from her. Only from you. From someone who uses the term snowflake a lot you sure seem to miss the irony.",

But the football player makes more so his time must be sooo much more valuable? \n\n\n[Calling a user \"old and washed up\" because they've been in the bowl for \"years\".](https://old.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/bhnr2e/major_warning/elws2ro/?context=3)Years could be 2, could be 3, could be 8 or even 12. But you had to attack her with ageism AND calling her washed up for...what reason?  Where were you attacked here? Did you feel personally insulted or have a nerve struck because she didn't seem to have a high opinion of SDs in general? \n\n\nBut you're right, clearly, even though these are direct links to obviously sexist comments and multiple unwarranted attacks, you have *never* made an off color comment and always engage this form with a nuetral, grounded perspective. \n\nPractice what you preach. \n\n[Bonus hilarious irony](https://old.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/bs46e7/payment_to_establish_chemistry/eoj5jvs/?context=3)",

If totallynotanescort *said* she was? Who cares. You already know rule 12 so check your behavior.

Read slowly out loud and ask for an adult to help you when you get stuck or the reading becomes too difficult for you.\n\nLet me know if I need to go get my crayons and draw pictures for you. \n\n1) you claimed you only call people escorts who are self identified. \n\n2) I prove this isn't the case as RussianAsshole has never called herself an escort or prostitute, yet you have accused of her such simply because of a sub she posts in. \n\n3)  Updated rule 12 says no comparing of SLF SBs to escorts. If RussianAsshole has never said she is one, how can she be \"self identified\"? Furthermore, [the extended rules have the admins agreeing that SBs can be escorts and escorts can be SBs but to leave all talk or comparisons at the door.](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/bisfdf/calcification_for_rule_12/em3kwwf)The update specific said, from the mods as represented by /u/malibijones\n\n> Going forward the Mods will be more aggressive with enforcing rule #12. If we see posts promoting sexworkers, **comparing SBs to Escorts, bringing up Escorts for the hell of it (examples list above)** we will remove the post. If we see the OP **is/was attempting to stir the pot**, side step the rule or ignore it we will ban the poster without warning. \n\n> Promoting the lifestyle, pushing $$ amounts, **bringing up Escorts for the hell of it, using the term to attack/shame/compare with someone else.**\n\nSo yeah. Given that the users you \"called out for being escorts since they are self proclaimed\" weren't even talking about escorting---**you** brought it up in an attempt to discredit whatever they were saying to begin with. And in the case of RussianAsshole, she is not \"self proclaimed\". You said it 1) as an attack and 2) when comparisons aren't welcome to begin with. She has nothing in her post history in the last year admitting to escorting. The rules don't say \"escorts can't post and their opinions aren't valid or welcome.\" The rule says as long as they dont compare it they're fine. None of the people you've listed have posted in SLF about their escorting experience--you are always the one to bring it up in an attempt to discredit them. So yes, *multiple* violations of rule 12 since the clarification.",

I saw *you* tell her she should seek help because of her past. I saw her say you must have some guilt if you are so vehemently against people protecting themselves against sex trafficking. If you took offense, that's on you, but I do not see any actual personal attacks from her. Only from you. From someone who uses the term snowflake a lot you sure seem to miss the irony.",

If totallynotanescort *said* she was? Who cares. You already know rule 12 so check your behavior.

Read slowly out loud and ask for an adult to help you when you get stuck or the reading becomes too difficult for you.\n\nLet me know if I need to go get my crayons and draw pictures for you. \n\n1) you claimed you only call people escorts who are self identified. \n\n2) I prove this isn't the case as RussianAsshole has never called herself an escort or prostitute, yet you have accused of her such simply because of a sub she posts in. \n\n3)  Updated rule 12 says no comparing of SLF SBs to escorts. If RussianAsshole has never said she is one, how can she be \"self identified\"? Furthermore, [the extended rules have the admins agreeing that SBs can be escorts and escorts can be SBs but to leave all talk or comparisons at the door.](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/bisfdf/calcification_for_rule_12/em3kwwf)The update specific said, from the mods as represented by /u/malibijones\n\n> Going forward the Mods will be more aggressive with enforcing rule #12. If we see posts promoting sexworkers, **comparing SBs to Escorts, bringing up Escorts for the hell of it (examples list above)** we will remove the post. If we see the OP **is/was attempting to stir the pot**, side step the rule or ignore it we will ban the poster without warning. \n\n> Promoting the lifestyle, pushing $$ amounts, **bringing up Escorts for the hell of it, using the term to attack/shame/compare with someone else.**\n\nSo yeah. Given that the users you \"called out for being escorts since they are self proclaimed\" weren't even talking about escorting---**you** brought it up in an attempt to discredit whatever they were saying to begin with. And in the case of RussianAsshole, she is not \"self proclaimed\". You said it 1) as an attack and 2) when comparisons aren't welcome to begin with. She has nothing in her post history in the last year admitting to escorting. The rules don't say \"escorts can't post and their opinions aren't valid or welcome.\" The rule says as long as they dont compare it they're fine. None of the people you've listed have posted in SLF about their escorting experience--you are always the one to bring it up in an attempt to discredit them. So yes, *multiple* violations of rule 12 since the clarification.",

Just because someone thinks sugaring is sex work doesn't mean that they are an escort. There are many SDs here who think sugaring is sex work, but they don't assume themselves or the SBs they see to be escorts and/or johns.\n\nIn RussianAsshole's example, in the past year she's never self identified as an escort. If she did before, I didn't scroll that far back. She posted in SexWorkersOnly, but that sub has cam girls, strippers, and sugar babies in it. She has posts saying [other SBs](https://old.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/9vkyhi/nyc_pot_who_refuses_to_take_the_subway/e9envcm/) indicating that she herself is one, but I couldn't find anything from her saying \"other escorts\" or \"other prostitutes\". The only thing I could find in the last year even vaguely alluding to it was a comment about why [escorting is better than sugaring.](https://old.reddit.com/r/SexWorkersOnly/comments/9ym6qa/whats_the_deal_with_sds/ea2smgj/)\n\nSo clearly, it isn't *just* when they're \"Self proclaimed\".

If totallynotanescort *said* she was? Who cares. You already know rule 12 so check your behavior. The mods have already stated that comparisons aren't welcome, and that escorts are free to post here so long as no comparisons between the escort job and their sugaring is mentioned.\n\nCalling out your bullshit isn't being obtuse. Its supplying facts where you keep *saying* things happened or were said, but the post history is proof that it didn't.  So either you need to go to a doctor to get your memory checked, you need to go to a neurologist for dyslexia, or you are trolling and pot stirring for no reason. \n\n\nAlso I have no idea how saying [\"women age like milk\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/SugarDatingForum/comments/bufq17/congratulations/epdxv5x)  or that [women can't attract high calibur men at 30 because their \"looks have faded\" \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/c44lf7/input_needed/eruw4yb) isnt gender bashing.

Read slowly out loud and ask for an adult to help you when you get stuck or the reading becomes too difficult for you.\n\nLet me know if I need to go get my crayons and draw pictures for you. \n\n1) you claimed you only call people escorts who are self identified. \n\n2) I prove this isn't the case as RussianAsshole has never called herself an escort or prostitute, yet you have accused of her such simply because of a sub she posts in. \n\n3)  Updated rule 12 says no comparing of SLF SBs to escorts. If RussianAsshole has never said she is one, how can she be \"self identified\"? Furthermore, [the extended rules have the admins agreeing that SBs can be escorts and escorts can be SBs but to leave all talk or comparisons at the door.](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/bisfdf/calcification_for_rule_12/em3kwwf)The update specific said, from the mods as represented by /u/malibijones\n\n> Going forward the Mods will be more aggressive with enforcing rule #12. If we see posts promoting sexworkers, **comparing SBs to Escorts, bringing up Escorts for the hell of it (examples list above)** we will remove the post. If we see the OP **is/was attempting to stir the pot**, side step the rule or ignore it we will ban the poster without warning. \n\n> Promoting the lifestyle, pushing $$ amounts, **bringing up Escorts for the hell of it, using the term to attack/shame/compare with someone else.**\n\nSo yeah. Given that the users you \"called out for being escorts since they are self proclaimed\" weren't even talking about escorting---**you** brought it up in an attempt to discredit whatever they were saying to begin with. And in the case of RussianAsshole, she is not \"self proclaimed\". You said it 1) as an attack and 2) when comparisons aren't welcome to begin with. She has nothing in her post history in the last year admitting to escorting. The rules don't say \"escorts can't post and their opinions aren't valid or welcome.\" The rule says as long as they dont compare it they're fine. None of the people you've listed have posted in SLF about their escorting experience--you are always the one to bring it up in an attempt to discredit them. So yes, *multiple* violations of rule 12 since the clarification.",

You can try to make me look bad all you want but some of us are aware of the dangers and realities within the bowl.\n\n> If it really irks you then you must have some sort of guilt, etc to work through.\n\nWhat personal attack did she make? I saw *you* tell her she should seek help because of her past. I saw her say you must have some guilt if you are so vehemently against people protecting themselves against sex trafficking. If you took offense, that's on you, but I do not see any actual personal attacks from her. Only from you. From someone who uses the term snowflake a lot you sure seem to miss the irony.",

If totallynotanescort *said* she was? Who cares. You already know rule 12 so check your behavior.

If RussianAsshole has never said she is one, how can she be \"self identified\"? Furthermore, [the extended rules have the admins agreeing that SBs can be escorts and escorts can be SBs but to leave all talk or comparisons at the door.](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/bisfdf/calcification_for_rule_12/em3kwwf)The update specific said, from the mods as represented by /u/malibijones\n\n> Going forward the Mods will be more aggressive with enforcing rule #12. If we see posts promoting sexworkers, **comparing SBs to Escorts, bringing up Escorts for the hell of it (examples list above)** we will remove the post. If we see the OP **is/was attempting to stir the pot**, side step the rule or ignore it we will ban the poster without warning. \n\n> Promoting the lifestyle, pushing $$ amounts, **bringing up Escorts for the hell of it, using the term to attack/shame/compare with someone else.**\n\nSo yeah. Given that the users you \"called out for being escorts since they are self proclaimed\" weren't even talking about escorting---**you** brought it up in an attempt to discredit whatever they were saying to begin with. And in the case of RussianAsshole, she is not \"self proclaimed\". You said it 1) as an attack and 2) when comparisons aren't welcome to begin with. She has nothing in her post history in the last year admitting to escorting. The rules don't say \"escorts can't post and their opinions aren't valid or welcome.\" The rule says as long as they dont compare it they're fine. None of the people you've listed have posted in SLF about their escorting experience--you are always the one to bring it up in an attempt to discredit them. So yes, *multiple* violations of rule 12 since the clarification.",

You can try to make me look bad all you want but some of us are aware of the dangers and realities within the bowl.\n\n> If it really irks you then you must have some sort of guilt, etc to work through.\n\nWhat personal attack did she make? I saw *you* tell her she should seek help because of her past. I saw her say you must have some guilt if you are so vehemently against people protecting themselves against sex trafficking. If you took offense, that's on you, but I do not see any actual personal attacks from her. Only from you. From someone who uses the term snowflake a lot you sure seem to miss the irony.",

If totallynotanescort *said* she was? Who cares. You already know rule 12 so check your behavior.

Read slowly out loud and ask for an adult to help you when you get stuck or the reading becomes too difficult for you.\n\nLet me know if I need to go get my crayons and draw pictures for you. \n\n1) you claimed you only call people escorts who are self identified. \n\n2) I prove this isn't the case as RussianAsshole has never called herself an escort or prostitute, yet you have accused of her such simply because of a sub she posts in. \n\n3)  Updated rule 12 says no comparing of SLF SBs to escorts. If RussianAsshole has never said she is one, how can she be \"self identified\"? Furthermore, [the extended rules have the admins agreeing that SBs can be escorts and escorts can be SBs but to leave all talk or comparisons at the door.](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/bisfdf/calcification_for_rule_12/em3kwwf)The update specific said, from the mods as represented by /u/malibijones\n\n> Going forward the Mods will be more aggressive with enforcing rule #12. If we see posts promoting sexworkers, **comparing SBs to Escorts, bringing up Escorts for the hell of it (examples list above)** we will remove the post. If we see the OP **is/was attempting to stir the pot**, side step the rule or ignore it we will ban the poster without warning. \n\n> Promoting the lifestyle, pushing $$ amounts, **bringing up Escorts for the hell of it, using the term to attack/shame/compare with someone else.**\n\nSo yeah. Given that the users you \"called out for being escorts since they are self proclaimed\" weren't even talking about escorting---**you** brought it up in an attempt to discredit whatever they were saying to begin with. And in the case of RussianAsshole, she is not \"self proclaimed\". You said it 1) as an attack and 2) when comparisons aren't welcome to begin with. She has nothing in her post history in the last year admitting to escorting. The rules don't say \"escorts can't post and their opinions aren't valid or welcome.\" The rule says as long as they dont compare it they're fine. None of the people you've listed have posted in SLF about their escorting experience--you are always the one to bring it up in an attempt to discredit them. So yes, *multiple* violations of rule 12 since the clarification.",

You can try to make me look bad all you want but some of us are aware of the dangers and realities within the bowl.\n\n> If it really irks you then you must have some sort of guilt, etc to work through.\n\nWhat personal attack did she make? I saw *you* tell her she should seek help because of her past. I saw her say you must have some guilt if you are so vehemently against people protecting themselves against sex trafficking. If you took offense, that's on you, but I do not see any actual personal attacks from her. Only from you. From someone who uses the term snowflake a lot you sure seem to miss the irony.",

Just because someone thinks sugaring is sex work doesn't mean that they are an escort. There are many SDs here who think sugaring is sex work, but they don't assume themselves or the SBs they see to be escorts and/or johns.\n\nIn RussianAsshole's example, in the past year she's never self identified as an escort. If she did before, I didn't scroll that far back. She posted in SexWorkersOnly, but that sub has cam girls, strippers, and sugar babies in it. She has posts saying [other SBs](https://old.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/9vkyhi/nyc_pot_who_refuses_to_take_the_subway/e9envcm/) indicating that she herself is one, but I couldn't find anything from her saying \"other escorts\" or \"other prostitutes\". The only thing I could find in the last year even vaguely alluding to it was a comment about why [escorting is better than sugaring.](https://old.reddit.com/r/SexWorkersOnly/comments/9ym6qa/whats_the_deal_with_sds/ea2smgj/)\n\nSo clearly, it isn't *just* when they're \"Self proclaimed\".

It's a direct copy and paste. \n\n> Totallynotanescort deleted all of her post history, but you can still see that she posted to the SexWorkersOnly reddit. \n\nOkay, so once again: just because someone posts there doesn't explicitly make them an escort. \n\nYou were supplied comments and scenarios where you ONCE AGAIN started escort shaming someone who has never said they were an escort. If totallynotanescort *said* she was? Who cares. You already know rule 12 so check your behavior. The mods have already stated that comparisons aren't welcome, and that escorts are free to post here so long as no comparisons between the escort job and their sugaring is mentioned.\n\nCalling out your bullshit isn't being obtuse. Its supplying facts where you keep *saying* things happened or were said, but the post history is proof that it didn't.  So either you need to go to a doctor to get your memory checked, you need to go to a neurologist for dyslexia, or you are trolling and pot stirring for no reason. \n\n\nAlso I have no idea how saying [\"women age like milk\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/SugarDatingForum/comments/bufq17/congratulations/epdxv5x)  or that [women can't attract high calibur men at 30 because their \"looks have faded\" \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/c44lf7/input_needed/eruw4yb) isnt gender bashing. Neither of these comments were made in response to gender bashing so don't even try.",

If RussianAsshole has never said she is one, how can she be \"self identified\"? Furthermore, [the extended rules have the admins agreeing that SBs can be escorts and escorts can be SBs but to leave all talk or comparisons at the door.](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/bisfdf/calcification_for_rule_12/em3kwwf)The update specific said, from the mods as represented by /u/malibijones\n\n> Going forward the Mods will be more aggressive with enforcing rule #12. If we see posts promoting sexworkers, **comparing SBs to Escorts, bringing up Escorts for the hell of it (examples list above)** we will remove the post. If we see the OP **is/was attempting to stir the pot**, side step the rule or ignore it we will ban the poster without warning. \n\n> Promoting the lifestyle, pushing $$ amounts, **bringing up Escorts for the hell of it, using the term to attack/shame/compare with someone else.**\n\nSo yeah. Given that the users you \"called out for being escorts since they are self proclaimed\" weren't even talking about escorting---**you** brought it up in an attempt to discredit whatever they were saying to begin with. And in the case of RussianAsshole, she is not \"self proclaimed\". You said it 1) as an attack and 2) when comparisons aren't welcome to begin with. She has nothing in her post history in the last year admitting to escorting. The rules don't say \"escorts can't post and their opinions aren't valid or welcome.\" The rule says as long as they dont compare it they're fine. None of the people you've listed have posted in SLF about their escorting experience--you are always the one to bring it up in an attempt to discredit them. So yes, *multiple* violations of rule 12 since the clarification.",

Just because someone thinks sugaring is sex work doesn't mean that they are an escort. There are many SDs here who think sugaring is sex work, but they don't assume themselves or the SBs they see to be escorts and/or johns.\n\nIn RussianAsshole's example, in the past year she's never self identified as an escort. If she did before, I didn't scroll that far back. She posted in SexWorkersOnly, but that sub has cam girls, strippers, and sugar babies in it. She has posts saying [other SBs](https://old.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/9vkyhi/nyc_pot_who_refuses_to_take_the_subway/e9envcm/) indicating that she herself is one, but I couldn't find anything from her saying \"other escorts\" or \"other prostitutes\". The only thing I could find in the last year even vaguely alluding to it was a comment about why [escorting is better than sugaring.](https://old.reddit.com/r/SexWorkersOnly/comments/9ym6qa/whats_the_deal_with_sds/ea2smgj/)\n\nSo clearly, it isn't *just* when they're \"Self proclaimed\".

It's a direct copy and paste. \n\n> Totallynotanescort deleted all of her post history, but you can still see that she posted to the SexWorkersOnly reddit. \n\nOkay, so once again: just because someone posts there doesn't explicitly make them an escort. \n\nYou were supplied comments and scenarios where you ONCE AGAIN started escort shaming someone who has never said they were an escort. If totallynotanescort *said* she was? Who cares. You already know rule 12 so check your behavior. The mods have already stated that comparisons aren't welcome, and that escorts are free to post here so long as no comparisons between the escort job and their sugaring is mentioned.\n\nCalling out your bullshit isn't being obtuse. Its supplying facts where you keep *saying* things happened or were said, but the post history is proof that it didn't.  So either you need to go to a doctor to get your memory checked, you need to go to a neurologist for dyslexia, or you are trolling and pot stirring for no reason. \n\n\nAlso I have no idea how saying [\"women age like milk\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/SugarDatingForum/comments/bufq17/congratulations/epdxv5x)  or that [women can't attract high calibur men at 30 because their \"looks have faded\" \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/c44lf7/input_needed/eruw4yb) isnt gender bashing. Neither of these comments were made in response to gender bashing so don't even try.",

If RussianAsshole has never said she is one, how can she be \"self identified\"? Furthermore, [the extended rules have the admins agreeing that SBs can be escorts and escorts can be SBs but to leave all talk or comparisons at the door.](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/bisfdf/calcification_for_rule_12/em3kwwf)The update specific said, from the mods as represented by /u/malibijones\n\n> Going forward the Mods will be more aggressive with enforcing rule #12. If we see posts promoting sexworkers, **comparing SBs to Escorts, bringing up Escorts for the hell of it (examples list above)** we will remove the post. If we see the OP **is/was attempting to stir the pot**, side step the rule or ignore it we will ban the poster without warning. \n\n> Promoting the lifestyle, pushing $$ amounts, **bringing up Escorts for the hell of it, using the term to attack/shame/compare with someone else.**\n\nSo yeah. Given that the users you \"called out for being escorts since they are self proclaimed\" weren't even talking about escorting---**you** brought it up in an attempt to discredit whatever they were saying to begin with. And in the case of RussianAsshole, she is not \"self proclaimed\". You said it 1) as an attack and 2) when comparisons aren't welcome to begin with. She has nothing in her post history in the last year admitting to escorting. The rules don't say \"escorts can't post and their opinions aren't valid or welcome.\" The rule says as long as they dont compare it they're fine. None of the people you've listed have posted in SLF about their escorting experience--you are always the one to bring it up in an attempt to discredit them.

Just because someone thinks sugaring is sex work doesn't mean that they are an escort. There are many SDs here who think sugaring is sex work, but they don't assume themselves or the SBs they see to be escorts and/or johns.\n\nIn RussianAsshole's example, in the past year she's never self identified as an escort. If she did before, I didn't scroll that far back. She posted in SexWorkersOnly, but that sub has cam girls, strippers, and sugar babies in it. She has posts saying [other SBs](https://old.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/9vkyhi/nyc_pot_who_refuses_to_take_the_subway/e9envcm/) indicating that she herself is one, but I couldn't find anything from her saying \"other escorts\" or \"other prostitutes\".

It's a direct copy and paste. \n\n> Totallynotanescort deleted all of her post history, but you can still see that she posted to the SexWorkersOnly reddit. \n\nOkay, so once again: just because someone posts there doesn't explicitly make them an escort. \n\nYou were supplied comments and scenarios where you ONCE AGAIN started escort shaming someone who has never said they were an escort. If totallynotanescort *said* she was? Who cares. You already know rule 12 so check your behavior. The mods have already stated that comparisons aren't welcome, and that escorts are free to post here so long as no comparisons between the escort job and their sugaring is mentioned.\n\nCalling out your bullshit isn't being obtuse. Its supplying facts where you keep *saying* things happened or were said, but the post history is proof that it didn't.  So either you need to go to a doctor to get your memory checked, you need to go to a neurologist for dyslexia, or you are trolling and pot stirring for no reason. \n\n\nAlso I have no idea how saying [\"women age like milk\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/SugarDatingForum/comments/bufq17/congratulations/epdxv5x)  or that [women can't attract high calibur men at 30 because their \"looks have faded\" \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/c44lf7/input_needed/eruw4yb) isnt gender bashing.

Read slowly out loud and ask for an adult to help you when you get stuck or the reading becomes too difficult for you.\n\nLet me know if I need to go get my crayons and draw pictures for you. \n\n1) you claimed you only call people escorts who are self identified. \n\n2) I prove this isn't the case as RussianAsshole has never called herself an escort or prostitute, yet you have accused of her such simply because of a sub she posts in. \n\n3)  Updated rule 12 says no comparing of SLF SBs to escorts. If RussianAsshole has never said she is one, how can she be \"self identified\"? Furthermore, [the extended rules have the admins agreeing that SBs can be escorts and escorts can be SBs but to leave all talk or comparisons at the door.](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/bisfdf/calcification_for_rule_12/em3kwwf)The update specific said, from the mods as represented by /u/malibijones\n\n> Going forward the Mods will be more aggressive with enforcing rule #12. If we see posts promoting sexworkers, **comparing SBs to Escorts, bringing up Escorts for the hell of it (examples list above)** we will remove the post. If we see the OP **is/was attempting to stir the pot**, side step the rule or ignore it we will ban the poster without warning. \n\n> Promoting the lifestyle, pushing $$ amounts, **bringing up Escorts for the hell of it, using the term to attack/shame/compare with someone else.**\n\nSo yeah. Given that the users you \"called out for being escorts since they are self proclaimed\" weren't even talking about escorting---**you** brought it up in an attempt to discredit whatever they were saying to begin with. And in the case of RussianAsshole, she is not \"self proclaimed\". You said it 1) as an attack and 2) when comparisons aren't welcome to begin with. She has nothing in her post history in the last year admitting to escorting. The rules don't say \"escorts can't post and their opinions aren't valid or welcome.\" The rule says as long as they dont compare it they're fine. None of the people you've listed have posted in SLF about their escorting experience--you are always the one to bring it up in an attempt to discredit them. So yes, *multiple* violations of rule 12 since the clarification.",

Just because someone thinks sugaring is sex work doesn't mean that they are an escort. There are many SDs here who think sugaring is sex work, but they don't assume themselves or the SBs they see to be escorts and/or johns.\n\nIn RussianAsshole's example, in the past year she's never self identified as an escort. If she did before, I didn't scroll that far back. She posted in SexWorkersOnly, but that sub has cam girls, strippers, and sugar babies in it. She has posts saying [other SBs](https://old.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/9vkyhi/nyc_pot_who_refuses_to_take_the_subway/e9envcm/) indicating that she herself is one, but I couldn't find anything from her saying \"other escorts\" or \"other prostitutes\". The only thing I could find in the last year even vaguely alluding to it was a comment about why [escorting is better than sugaring.](https://old.reddit.com/r/SexWorkersOnly/comments/9ym6qa/whats_the_deal_with_sds/ea2smgj/)\n\nSo clearly, it isn't *just* when they're \"Self proclaimed\".

It's a direct copy and paste. \n\n> Totallynotanescort deleted all of her post history, but you can still see that she posted to the SexWorkersOnly reddit. \n\nOkay, so once again: just because someone posts there doesn't explicitly make them an escort. \n\nYou were supplied comments and scenarios where you ONCE AGAIN started escort shaming someone who has never said they were an escort. If totallynotanescort *said* she was? Who cares. You already know rule 12 so check your behavior. The mods have already stated that comparisons aren't welcome, and that escorts are free to post here so long as no comparisons between the escort job and their sugaring is mentioned.\n\nCalling out your bullshit isn't being obtuse. Its supplying facts where you keep *saying* things happened or were said, but the post history is proof that it didn't.  So either you need to go to a doctor to get your memory checked, you need to go to a neurologist for dyslexia, or you are trolling and pot stirring for no reason. \n\n\nAlso I have no idea how saying [\"women age like milk\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/SugarDatingForum/comments/bufq17/congratulations/epdxv5x)  or that [women can't attract high calibur men at 30 because their \"looks have faded\" \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/c44lf7/input_needed/eruw4yb) isnt gender bashing.

If RussianAsshole has never said she is one, how can she be \"self identified\"? Furthermore, [the extended rules have the admins agreeing that SBs can be escorts and escorts can be SBs but to leave all talk or comparisons at the door.](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/bisfdf/calcification_for_rule_12/em3kwwf)The update specific said, from the mods as represented by /u/malibijones\n\n> Going forward the Mods will be more aggressive with enforcing rule #12. If we see posts promoting sexworkers, **comparing SBs to Escorts, bringing up Escorts for the hell of it (examples list above)** we will remove the post. If we see the OP **is/was attempting to stir the pot**, side step the rule or ignore it we will ban the poster without warning. \n\n> Promoting the lifestyle, pushing $$ amounts, **bringing up Escorts for the hell of it, using the term to attack/shame/compare with someone else.**\n\nSo yeah. Given that the users you \"called out for being escorts since they are self proclaimed\" weren't even talking about escorting---**you** brought it up in an attempt to discredit whatever they were saying to begin with. And in the case of RussianAsshole, she is not \"self proclaimed\". You said it 1) as an attack and 2) when comparisons aren't welcome to begin with. She has nothing in her post history in the last year admitting to escorting. The rules don't say \"escorts can't post and their opinions aren't valid or welcome.\" The rule says as long as they dont compare it they're fine. None of the people you've listed have posted in SLF about their escorting experience--you are always the one to bring it up in an attempt to discredit them. So yes, *multiple* violations of rule 12 since the clarification.",

Just because someone thinks sugaring is sex work doesn't mean that they are an escort. There are many SDs here who think sugaring is sex work, but they don't assume themselves or the SBs they see to be escorts and/or johns.\n\nIn RussianAsshole's example, in the past year she's never self identified as an escort. If she did before, I didn't scroll that far back. She posted in SexWorkersOnly, but that sub has cam girls, strippers, and sugar babies in it. She has posts saying [other SBs](https://old.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/9vkyhi/nyc_pot_who_refuses_to_take_the_subway/e9envcm/) indicating that she herself is one, but I couldn't find anything from her saying \"other escorts\" or \"other prostitutes\". The only thing I could find in the last year even vaguely alluding to it was a comment about why [escorting is better than sugaring.](https://old.reddit.com/r/SexWorkersOnly/comments/9ym6qa/whats_the_deal_with_sds/ea2smgj/)\n\nSo clearly, it isn't *just* when they're \"Self proclaimed\".

It's a direct copy and paste. \n\n> Totallynotanescort deleted all of her post history, but you can still see that she posted to the SexWorkersOnly reddit. \n\nOkay, so once again: just because someone posts there doesn't explicitly make them an escort. \n\nYou were supplied comments and scenarios where you ONCE AGAIN started escort shaming someone who has never said they were an escort. If totallynotanescort *said* she was? Who cares. You already know rule 12 so check your behavior. The mods have already stated that comparisons aren't welcome, and that escorts are free to post here so long as no comparisons between the escort job and their sugaring is mentioned.\n\nCalling out your bullshit isn't being obtuse. Its supplying facts where you keep *saying* things happened or were said, but the post history is proof that it didn't.  So either you need to go to a doctor to get your memory checked, you need to go to a neurologist for dyslexia, or you are trolling and pot stirring for no reason. \n\n\nAlso I have no idea how saying [\"women age like milk\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/SugarDatingForum/comments/bufq17/congratulations/epdxv5x)  or that [women can't attract high calibur men at 30 because their \"looks have faded\" \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/c44lf7/input_needed/eruw4yb) isnt gender bashing.

If we see the OP **is/was attempting to stir the pot**, side step the rule or ignore it we will ban the poster without warning. \n\n> Promoting the lifestyle, pushing $$ amounts, **bringing up Escorts for the hell of it, using the term to attack/shame/compare with someone else.**\n\nSo yeah. Given that the users you \"called out for being escorts since they are self proclaimed\" weren't even talking about escorting---**you** brought it up in an attempt to discredit whatever they were saying to begin with. And in the case of RussianAsshole, she is not \"self proclaimed\". You said it 1) as an attack and 2) when comparisons aren't welcome to begin with. She has nothing in her post history in the last year admitting to escorting. The rules don't say \"escorts can't post and their opinions aren't valid or welcome.\" The rule says as long as they dont compare it they're fine. None of the people you've listed have posted in SLF about their escorting experience--you are always the one to bring it up in an attempt to discredit them. So yes, *multiple* violations of rule 12 since the clarification.",

Just because someone thinks sugaring is sex work doesn't mean that they are an escort. There are many SDs here who think sugaring is sex work, but they don't assume themselves or the SBs they see to be escorts and/or johns.\n\nIn RussianAsshole's example, in the past year she's never self identified as an escort. If she did before, I didn't scroll that far back. She posted in SexWorkersOnly, but that sub has cam girls, strippers, and sugar babies in it. She has posts saying [other SBs](https://old.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/9vkyhi/nyc_pot_who_refuses_to_take_the_subway/e9envcm/) indicating that she herself is one, but I couldn't find anything from her saying \"other escorts\" or \"other prostitutes\". The only thing I could find in the last year even vaguely alluding to it was a comment about why [escorting is better than sugaring.](https://old.reddit.com/r/SexWorkersOnly/comments/9ym6qa/whats_the_deal_with_sds/ea2smgj/)\n\nSo clearly, it isn't *just* when they're \"Self proclaimed\".

If totallynotanescort *said* she was? Who cares. You already know rule 12 so check your behavior. The mods have already stated that comparisons aren't welcome, and that escorts are free to post here so long as no comparisons between the escort job and their sugaring is mentioned.\n\nCalling out your bullshit isn't being obtuse. Its supplying facts where you keep *saying* things happened or were said, but the post history is proof that it didn't.  So either you need to go to a doctor to get your memory checked, you need to go to a neurologist for dyslexia, or you are trolling and pot stirring for no reason. \n\n\nAlso I have no idea how saying [\"women age like milk\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/SugarDatingForum/comments/bufq17/congratulations/epdxv5x)  or that [women can't attract high calibur men at 30 because their \"looks have faded\" \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/c44lf7/input_needed/eruw4yb) isnt gender bashing.

If we see posts promoting sexworkers, **comparing SBs to Escorts, bringing up Escorts for the hell of it (examples list above)** we will remove the post.

Given that the users you \"called out for being escorts since they are self proclaimed\" weren't even talking about escorting---**you** brought it up in an attempt to discredit whatever they were saying to begin with. And in the case of RussianAsshole, she is not \"self proclaimed\". You said it 1) as an attack and 2) when comparisons aren't welcome to begin with. She has nothing in her post history in the last year admitting to escorting. The rules don't say \"escorts can't post and their opinions aren't valid or welcome.\" The rule says as long as they dont compare it they're fine. None of the people you've listed have posted in SLF about their escorting experience--you are always the one to bring it up in an attempt to discredit them. So yes, *multiple* violations of rule 12 since the clarification.",

It's a direct copy and paste. \n\n> Totallynotanescort deleted all of her post history, but you can still see that she posted to the SexWorkersOnly reddit. \n\nOkay, so once again: just because someone posts there doesn't explicitly make them an escort. \n\nYou were supplied comments and scenarios where you ONCE AGAIN started escort shaming someone who has never said they were an escort. If totallynotanescort *said* she was? Who cares. You already know rule 12 so check your behavior. The mods have already stated that comparisons aren't welcome, and that escorts are free to post here so long as no comparisons between the escort job and their sugaring is mentioned.\n\nCalling out your bullshit isn't being obtuse. Its supplying facts where you keep *saying* things happened or were said, but the post history is proof that it didn't.  So either you need to go to a doctor to get your memory checked, you need to go to a neurologist for dyslexia, or you are trolling and pot stirring for no reason. \n\n\nAlso I have no idea how saying [\"women age like milk\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/SugarDatingForum/comments/bufq17/congratulations/epdxv5x)  or that [women can't attract high calibur men at 30 because their \"looks have faded\" \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/c44lf7/input_needed/eruw4yb) isnt gender bashing. Neither of these comments were made in response to gender bashing so don't even try.",

Read slowly out loud and ask for an adult to help you when you get stuck or the reading becomes too difficult for you.\n\nLet me know if I need to go get my crayons and draw pictures for you. \n\n1) you claimed you only call people escorts who are self identified. \n\n2) I prove this isn't the case as RussianAsshole has never called herself an escort or prostitute, yet you have accused of her such simply because of a sub she posts in. \n\n3)  Updated rule 12 says no comparing of SLF SBs to escorts. If RussianAsshole has never said she is one, how can she be \"self identified\"? Furthermore, [the extended rules have the admins agreeing that SBs can be escorts and escorts can be SBs but to leave all talk or comparisons at the door.](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/bisfdf/calcification_for_rule_12/em3kwwf)The update specific said, from the mods as represented by /u/malibijones\n\n> Going forward the Mods will be more aggressive with enforcing rule #12. If we see posts promoting sexworkers, **comparing SBs to Escorts, bringing up Escorts for the hell of it (examples list above)** we will remove the post. If we see the OP **is/was attempting to stir the pot**, side step the rule or ignore it we will ban the poster without warning. \n\n> Promoting the lifestyle, pushing $$ amounts, **bringing up Escorts for the hell of it, using the term to attack/shame/compare with someone else.**\n\nSo yeah. Given that the users you \"called out for being escorts since they are self proclaimed\" weren't even talking about escorting---**you** brought it up in an attempt to discredit whatever they were saying to begin with. And in the case of RussianAsshole, she is not \"self proclaimed\". You said it 1) as an attack and 2) when comparisons aren't welcome to begin with. She has nothing in her post history in the last year admitting to escorting. The rules don't say \"escorts can't post and their opinions aren't valid or welcome.\" The rule says as long as they dont compare it they're fine. None of the people you've listed have posted in SLF about their escorting experience--you are always the one to bring it up in an attempt to discredit them. So yes, *multiple* violations of rule 12 since the clarification.",

It's a direct copy and paste. \n\n> Totallynotanescort deleted all of her post history, but you can still see that she posted to the SexWorkersOnly reddit. \n\nOkay, so once again: just because someone posts there doesn't explicitly make them an escort. \n\nYou were supplied comments and scenarios where you ONCE AGAIN started escort shaming someone who has never said they were an escort. If totallynotanescort *said* she was? Who cares. You already know rule 12 so check your behavior. The mods have already stated that comparisons aren't welcome, and that escorts are free to post here so long as no comparisons between the escort job and their sugaring is mentioned.\n\nCalling out your bullshit isn't being obtuse. Its supplying facts where you keep *saying* things happened or were said, but the post history is proof that it didn't.  So either you need to go to a doctor to get your memory checked, you need to go to a neurologist for dyslexia, or you are trolling and pot stirring for no reason. \n\n\nAlso I have no idea how saying [\"women age like milk\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/SugarDatingForum/comments/bufq17/congratulations/epdxv5x)  or that [women can't attract high calibur men at 30 because their \"looks have faded\" \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/c44lf7/input_needed/eruw4yb) isnt gender bashing. Neither of these comments were made in response to gender bashing so don't even try.",

Read slowly out loud and ask for an adult to help you when you get stuck or the reading becomes too difficult for you.\n\nLet me know if I need to go get my crayons and draw pictures for you. \n\n1) you claimed you only call people escorts who are self identified. \n\n2) I prove this isn't the case as RussianAsshole has never called herself an escort or prostitute, yet you have accused of her such simply because of a sub she posts in. \n\n3)  Updated rule 12 says no comparing of SLF SBs to escorts. If RussianAsshole has never said she is one, how can she be \"self identified\"? Furthermore, [the extended rules have the admins agreeing that SBs can be escorts and escorts can be SBs but to leave all talk or comparisons at the door.](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/bisfdf/calcification_for_rule_12/em3kwwf)The update specific said, from the mods as represented by /u/malibijones\n\n> Going forward the Mods will be more aggressive with enforcing rule #12. If we see posts promoting sexworkers, **comparing SBs to Escorts, bringing up Escorts for the hell of it (examples list above)** we will remove the post. If we see the OP **is/was attempting to stir the pot**, side step the rule or ignore it we will ban the poster without warning. \n\n> Promoting the lifestyle, pushing $$ amounts, **bringing up Escorts for the hell of it, using the term to attack/shame/compare with someone else.**\n\nSo yeah. Given that the users you \"called out for being escorts since they are self proclaimed\" weren't even talking about escorting---**you** brought it up in an attempt to discredit whatever they were saying to begin with. And in the case of RussianAsshole, she is not \"self proclaimed\". You said it 1) as an attack and 2) when comparisons aren't welcome to begin with. She has nothing in her post history in the last year admitting to escorting. The rules don't say \"escorts can't post and their opinions aren't valid or welcome.\" The rule says as long as they dont compare it they're fine. None of the people you've listed have posted in SLF about their escorting experience--you are always the one to bring it up in an attempt to discredit them. So yes, *multiple* violations of rule 12 since the clarification.",

Read slowly out loud and ask for an adult to help you when you get stuck or the reading becomes too difficult for you.\n\nLet me know if I need to go get my crayons and draw pictures for you. \n\n1) you claimed you only call people escorts who are self identified. \n\n2) I prove this isn't the case as RussianAsshole has never called herself an escort or prostitute, yet you have accused of her such simply because of a sub she posts in. \n\n3)  Updated rule 12 says no comparing of SLF SBs to escorts. If RussianAsshole has never said she is one, how can she be \"self identified\"? Furthermore, [the extended rules have the admins agreeing that SBs can be escorts and escorts can be SBs but to leave all talk or comparisons at the door.](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/bisfdf/calcification_for_rule_12/em3kwwf)The update specific said, from the mods as represented by /u/malibijones\n\n> Going forward the Mods will be more aggressive with enforcing rule #12. If we see posts promoting sexworkers, **comparing SBs to Escorts, bringing up Escorts for the hell of it (examples list above)** we will remove the post. If we see the OP **is/was attempting to stir the pot**, side step the rule or ignore it we will ban the poster without warning. \n\n> Promoting the lifestyle, pushing $$ amounts, **bringing up Escorts for the hell of it, using the term to attack/shame/compare with someone else.**\n\nSo yeah. Given that the users you \"called out for being escorts since they are self proclaimed\" weren't even talking about escorting---**you** brought it up in an attempt to discredit whatever they were saying to begin with. And in the case of RussianAsshole, she is not \"self proclaimed\". You said it 1) as an attack and 2) when comparisons aren't welcome to begin with. She has nothing in her post history in the last year admitting to escorting. The rules don't say \"escorts can't post and their opinions aren't valid or welcome.\" The rule says as long as they dont compare it they're fine. None of the people you've listed have posted in SLF about their escorting experience--you are always the one to bring it up in an attempt to discredit them. So yes, *multiple* violations of rule 12 since the clarification.",

Read slowly out loud and ask for an adult to help you when you get stuck or the reading becomes too difficult for you.\n\nLet me know if I need to go get my crayons and draw pictures for you. \n\n1) you claimed you only call people escorts who are self identified. \n\n2) I prove this isn't the case as RussianAsshole has never called herself an escort or prostitute, yet you have accused of her such simply because of a sub she posts in. \n\n3)  Updated rule 12 says no comparing of SLF SBs to escorts. If RussianAsshole has never said she is one, how can she be \"self identified\"? Furthermore, [the extended rules have the admins agreeing that SBs can be escorts and escorts can be SBs but to leave all talk or comparisons at the door.](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/bisfdf/calcification_for_rule_12/em3kwwf)The update specific said, from the mods as represented by /u/malibijones\n\n> Going forward the Mods will be more aggressive with enforcing rule #12. If we see posts promoting sexworkers, **comparing SBs to Escorts, bringing up Escorts for the hell of it (examples list above)** we will remove the post. If we see the OP **is/was attempting to stir the pot**, side step the rule or ignore it we will ban the poster without warning. \n\n> Promoting the lifestyle, pushing $$ amounts, **bringing up Escorts for the hell of it, using the term to attack/shame/compare with someone else.**\n\nSo yeah. Given that the users you \"called out for being escorts since they are self proclaimed\" weren't even talking about escorting---**you** brought it up in an attempt to discredit whatever they were saying to begin with. And in the case of RussianAsshole, she is not \"self proclaimed\". You said it 1) as an attack and 2) when comparisons aren't welcome to begin with. She has nothing in her post history in the last year admitting to escorting. The rules don't say \"escorts can't post and their opinions aren't valid or welcome.\" The rule says as long as they dont compare it they're fine. None of the people you've listed have posted in SLF about their escorting experience--you are always the one to bring it up in an attempt to discredit them. So yes, *multiple* violations of rule 12 since the clarification.",

Read slowly out loud and ask for an adult to help you when you get stuck or the reading becomes too difficult for you.\n\nLet me know if I need to go get my crayons and draw pictures for you. \n\n1) you claimed you only call people escorts who are self identified. \n\n2) I prove this isn't the case as RussianAsshole has never called herself an escort or prostitute, yet you have accused of her such simply because of a sub she posts in. \n\n3)  Updated rule 12 says no comparing of SLF SBs to escorts. If RussianAsshole has never said she is one, how can she be \"self identified\"? Furthermore, [the extended rules have the admins agreeing that SBs can be escorts and escorts can be SBs but to leave all talk or comparisons at the door.](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/bisfdf/calcification_for_rule_12/em3kwwf)The update specific said, from the mods as represented by /u/malibijones\n\n> Going forward the Mods will be more aggressive with enforcing rule #12. If we see posts promoting sexworkers, **comparing SBs to Escorts, bringing up Escorts for the hell of it (examples list above)** we will remove the post. If we see the OP **is/was attempting to stir the pot**, side step the rule or ignore it we will ban the poster without warning. \n\n> Promoting the lifestyle, pushing $$ amounts, **bringing up Escorts for the hell of it, using the term to attack/shame/compare with someone else.**\n\nSo yeah. Given that the users you \"called out for being escorts since they are self proclaimed\" weren't even talking about escorting---**you** brought it up in an attempt to discredit whatever they were saying to begin with. And in the case of RussianAsshole, she is not \"self proclaimed\". You said it 1) as an attack and 2) when comparisons aren't welcome to begin with. She has nothing in her post history in the last year admitting to escorting. The rules don't say \"escorts can't post and their opinions aren't valid or welcome.\" The rule says as long as they dont compare it they're fine. None of the people you've listed have posted in SLF about their escorting experience--you are always the one to bring it up in an attempt to discredit them. So yes, *multiple* violations of rule 12 since the clarification.",

Read slowly out loud and ask for an adult to help you when you get stuck or the reading becomes too difficult for you.\n\nLet me know if I need to go get my crayons and draw pictures for you. \n\n1) you claimed you only call people escorts who are self identified. \n\n2) I prove this isn't the case as RussianAsshole has never called herself an escort or prostitute, yet you have accused of her such simply because of a sub she posts in. \n\n3)  Updated rule 12 says no comparing of SLF SBs to escorts. If RussianAsshole has never said she is one, how can she be \"self identified\"? Furthermore, [the extended rules have the admins agreeing that SBs can be escorts and escorts can be SBs but to leave all talk or comparisons at the door.](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/bisfdf/calcification_for_rule_12/em3kwwf)The update specific said, from the mods as represented by /u/malibijones\n\n> Going forward the Mods will be more aggressive with enforcing rule #12. If we see posts promoting sexworkers, **comparing SBs to Escorts, bringing up Escorts for the hell of it (examples list above)** we will remove the post. If we see the OP **is/was attempting to stir the pot**, side step the rule or ignore it we will ban the poster without warning. \n\n> Promoting the lifestyle, pushing $$ amounts, **bringing up Escorts for the hell of it, using the term to attack/shame/compare with someone else.**\n\nSo yeah. Given that the users you \"called out for being escorts since they are self proclaimed\" weren't even talking about escorting---**you** brought it up in an attempt to discredit whatever they were saying to begin with. And in the case of RussianAsshole, she is not \"self proclaimed\". You said it 1) as an attack and 2) when comparisons aren't welcome to begin with. She has nothing in her post history in the last year admitting to escorting. The rules don't say \"escorts can't post and their opinions aren't valid or welcome.\" The rule says as long as they dont compare it they're fine.

Read slowly out loud and ask for an adult to help you when you get stuck or the reading becomes too difficult for you.\n\nLet me know if I need to go get my crayons and draw pictures for you. \n\n1) you claimed you only call people escorts who are self identified. \n\n2) I prove this isn't the case as RussianAsshole has never called herself an escort or prostitute, yet you have accused of her such simply because of a sub she posts in. \n\n3)  Updated rule 12 says no comparing of SLF SBs to escorts. If RussianAsshole has never said she is one, how can she be \"self identified\"? Furthermore, [the extended rules have the admins agreeing that SBs can be escorts and escorts can be SBs but to leave all talk or comparisons at the door.](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/bisfdf/calcification_for_rule_12/em3kwwf)The update specific said, from the mods as represented by /u/malibijones\n\n> Going forward the Mods will be more aggressive with enforcing rule #12. If we see posts promoting sexworkers, **comparing SBs to Escorts, bringing up Escorts for the hell of it (examples list above)** we will remove the post. If we see the OP **is/was attempting to stir the pot**, side step the rule or ignore it we will ban the poster without warning. \n\n> Promoting the lifestyle, pushing $$ amounts, **bringing up Escorts for the hell of it, using the term to attack/shame/compare with someone else.**\n\nSo yeah. Given that the users you \"called out for being escorts since they are self proclaimed\" weren't even talking about escorting---**you** brought it up in an attempt to discredit whatever they were saying to begin with. And in the case of RussianAsshole, she is not \"self proclaimed\". You said it 1) as an attack and 2) when comparisons aren't welcome to begin with. She has nothing in her post history in the last year admitting to escorting. The rules don't say \"escorts can't post and their opinions aren't valid or welcome.\" The rule says as long as they dont compare it they're fine. None of the people you've listed have posted in SLF about their escorting experience--you are always the one to bring it up in an attempt to discredit them. So yes, *multiple* violations of rule 12 since the clarification.",

Read slowly out loud and ask for an adult to help you when you get stuck or the reading becomes too difficult for you.\n\nLet me know if I need to go get my crayons and draw pictures for you. \n\n1) you claimed you only call people escorts who are self identified. \n\n2) I prove this isn't the case as RussianAsshole has never called herself an escort or prostitute, yet you have accused of her such simply because of a sub she posts in. \n\n3)  Updated rule 12 says no comparing of SLF SBs to escorts. If RussianAsshole has never said she is one, how can she be \"self identified\"? Furthermore, [the extended rules have the admins agreeing that SBs can be escorts and escorts can be SBs but to leave all talk or comparisons at the door.](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/bisfdf/calcification_for_rule_12/em3kwwf)The update specific said, from the mods as represented by /u/malibijones\n\n> Going forward the Mods will be more aggressive with enforcing rule #12. If we see posts promoting sexworkers, **comparing SBs to Escorts, bringing up Escorts for the hell of it (examples list above)** we will remove the post. If we see the OP **is/was attempting to stir the pot**, side step the rule or ignore it we will ban the poster without warning. \n\n> Promoting the lifestyle, pushing $$ amounts, **bringing up Escorts for the hell of it, using the term to attack/shame/compare with someone else.**\n\nSo yeah. Given that the users you \"called out for being escorts since they are self proclaimed\" weren't even talking about escorting---**you** brought it up in an attempt to discredit whatever they were saying to begin with. And in the case of RussianAsshole, she is not \"self proclaimed\". You said it 1) as an attack and 2) when comparisons aren't welcome to begin with. She has nothing in her post history in the last year admitting to escorting. The rules don't say \"escorts can't post and their opinions aren't valid or welcome.\" The rule says as long as they dont compare it they're fine. None of the people you've listed have posted in SLF about their escorting experience--you are always the one to bring it up in an attempt to discredit them. So yes, *multiple* violations of rule 12 since the clarification.",

Read slowly out loud and ask for an adult to help you when you get stuck or the reading becomes too difficult for you.\n\nLet me know if I need to go get my crayons and draw pictures for you. \n\n1) you claimed you only call people escorts who are self identified. \n\n2) I prove this isn't the case as RussianAsshole has never called herself an escort or prostitute, yet you have accused of her such simply because of a sub she posts in. \n\n3)  Updated rule 12 says no comparing of SLF SBs to escorts. If RussianAsshole has never said she is one, how can she be \"self identified\"? Furthermore, [the extended rules have the admins agreeing that SBs can be escorts and escorts can be SBs but to leave all talk or comparisons at the door.](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/bisfdf/calcification_for_rule_12/em3kwwf)The update specific said, from the mods as represented by /u/malibijones\n\n> Going forward the Mods will be more aggressive with enforcing rule #12. If we see posts promoting sexworkers, **comparing SBs to Escorts, bringing up Escorts for the hell of it (examples list above)** we will remove the post. If we see the OP **is/was attempting to stir the pot**, side step the rule or ignore it we will ban the poster without warning. \n\n> Promoting the lifestyle, pushing $$ amounts, **bringing up Escorts for the hell of it, using the term to attack/shame/compare with someone else.**\n\nSo yeah. Given that the users you \"called out for being escorts since they are self proclaimed\" weren't even talking about escorting---**you** brought it up in an attempt to discredit whatever they were saying to begin with. And in the case of RussianAsshole, she is not \"self proclaimed\". You said it 1) as an attack and 2) when comparisons aren't welcome to begin with. She has nothing in her post history in the last year admitting to escorting. The rules don't say \"escorts can't post and their opinions aren't valid or welcome.\" The rule says as long as they dont compare it they're fine. None of the people you've listed have posted in SLF about their escorting experience--you are always the one to bring it up in an attempt to discredit them. So yes, *multiple* violations of rule 12 since the clarification.",

Read slowly out loud and ask for an adult to help you when you get stuck or the reading becomes too difficult for you.\n\nLet me know if I need to go get my crayons and draw pictures for you. \n\n1) you claimed you only call people escorts who are self identified. \n\n2) I prove this isn't the case as RussianAsshole has never called herself an escort or prostitute, yet you have accused of her such simply because of a sub she posts in. \n\n3)  Updated rule 12 says no comparing of SLF SBs to escorts. If RussianAsshole has never said she is one, how can she be \"self identified\"? Furthermore, [the extended rules have the admins agreeing that SBs can be escorts and escorts can be SBs but to leave all talk or comparisons at the door.](http://reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/bisfdf/calcification_for_rule_12/em3kwwf)The update specific said, from the mods as represented by /u/malibijones\n\n> Going forward the Mods will be more aggressive with enforcing rule #12. If we see posts promoting sexworkers, **comparing SBs to Escorts, bringing up Escorts for the hell of it (examples list above)** we will remove the post. If we see the OP **is/was attempting to stir the pot**, side step the rule or ignore it we will ban the poster without warning. \n\n> Promoting the lifestyle, pushing $$ amounts, **bringing up Escorts for the hell of it, using the term to attack/shame/compare with someone else.**\n\nSo yeah. Given that the users you \"called out for being escorts since they are self proclaimed\" weren't even talking about escorting---**you** brought it up in an attempt to discredit whatever they were saying to begin with. And in the case of RussianAsshole, she is not \"self proclaimed\". You said it 1) as an attack and 2) when comparisons aren't welcome to begin with. She has nothing in her post history in the last year admitting to escorting. The rules don't say \"escorts can't post and their opinions aren't valid or welcome.\" The rule says as long as they dont compare it they're fine. None of the people you've listed have posted in SLF about their escorting experience--you are always the one to bring it up in an attempt to discredit them. So yes, *multiple* violations of rule 12 since the clarification.",
