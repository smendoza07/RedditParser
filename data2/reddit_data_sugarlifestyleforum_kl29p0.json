    "body": "Just had my first ever meet and greet after about 6 months of looking. Now I wasn't looking in great places. Tinder, reddit lol, escort sites, etc...but I finally joined Seeking Christmas Eve. Had a lot of responses. More than I could answer.  A few days later and my first M&G was great! We worked out our needs and expectations spent the night together! Pretty sure she is coming over tomorrow and Monday. Super happy to be part of this world and I have been lurking here a while and wanted to thank the community for the advice and insights provided here!\n\nEdit: thank you all for the support and the welcome =-)",

Sometime you are going to have to share your secrets with the rest of us.\n\nGood on you, and I hope you and your new SB are very happy.",
