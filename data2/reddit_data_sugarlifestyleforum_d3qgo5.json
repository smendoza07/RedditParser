    "body": "Earlier this week, I was at the hotel bar with my sb, just chilling with some pear-tinis and trying to use my indoor voice to tell her incest themed jokes. I got this craving for s'mores, so I suggested we roast some marshmallows. I know I look like a nerd in a suit on the outside, but I am 100% Disney princess on the inside.  I admit, 95% of this idea was me wanting dessert, and the other 5% was me enjoying the look on my sbs's face of 'oh my god, am I banging a child?'\n#\nAnyway, shout out to Shutters in Santa Monica, who not only set up a firepit on the beach for us, but sent one of their staff to get smores ingredients for my high maintenance ass.\n#\nWell, we sit down, and my sb just lights up three straight marshmallows. It's not incompetence. She seems to be intentionally turning my adorable date idea into marshmallow Auschwitz.  Ugh. Why do so many girls from seeking turn out to be hot Hitler?  She is making burnt sugar sandwichs, and I'm trying not to gag on my champagne while she eats them.\n#\nMeanwhile, I have slowly turned one marshmallow into a perfect bronze sculpture. I basically have a little Dwayne Johnson on the end of a stick. (Rock, can you smell what *I'm* cooking? Cuz it's you buddy.)  Now there is no way for me to overstate how good my s'mores are. I basically make chocolate flavored heroin. Folks, I really adore this sb, so I offer her half of mine. To be clear, if my own mother wanted half of one of my s'mores, I would promptly tell that s'more whore to get bent. My s'mores are mine. So I hope you understand how much I like this girl.\n#\nI broke my s'more in half and gave her the smaller portion (my generosity has limits). Of course, when she takes a bite, her eyes are all rolling in the back of her head. She says it's \"the best\" thing she ever tasted. Okay, ouch? I take my user name very seriously. \"Babe, don't you mean it's the *second* best thing that's ever been in your mouth?\"  Apparently, my ego is made out of marshmallow, because she burnt the fuck out of that too.",
