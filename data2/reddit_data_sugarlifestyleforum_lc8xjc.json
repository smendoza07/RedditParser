    "body": "I have to gush. Over the summer Reddit helped me find the best SB I've ever had, after 4+ years of doing this on and off. \n\n(Yes, it's a he and I am he. We exist.)\n\nHe's such a catch - he is smart and well educated; we can talk about anything from sports to business to his career to my career; he hasn't got a whiff of snobbery or cattiness to him; he's adventurous and kind and open and warm. He's unbelievably thoughtful - keeping tabs on my challenges at home and work. \n\nPhysically he is an absolute catch. Tall and dark, with great style and swagger; narrow waist, a powerful runners build with a lot of definition. An amazing warm smile. An ass that begs for attention. And a package.. that leaves nothing to be desired.\n\nWe've been seeing each other once a month or so despite COVID lock downs, and to be honest they've been the happiest and most enjoyable dates of my life. New York, Orlando, Daytona Beach, Miami - all a blast. \n\nI had a former SB post some shit about me on this sub, passively aggressively hoping I'd get back in touch even if just to fight, and he was more upset about it than I was.\n\nThe message and takeaway is that meaningful relationships are possible. I get an amazing amount of pleasure from being his SD; he's such a quality person I hope we can continue to enjoy each other for the long-haul. And it makes me wistful thinking about how lucky someone is going to be to match with him long-term. Quality guys are hard to find. And he's the best of the unicorns. A man worth fighting for.",

He is the greatest family man that somehow has so much time and energy for his friends. He so easy to talk to and spend time with. He thinks he's boring; but he's the beginning middle and end of amazing stories that keep me captivated. And motivated to be a slither of the man he is today. \n\nI'm typing this comment at the end of an absolutely amazing date with so maybe I'm floating on cloud 9 but this man is a gem and I couldn't be more grateful I have him in my life. He's probably in the bed snoring right now so I'm gonna end this by saying:\n\nYou're fucking amazing. I'm so grateful to have you in my life. Fuck what anyone has to say. You're the fucking man.
