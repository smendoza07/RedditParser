    "body": "This weekend I met up with a sugar daddy. He seemed nice online, but when I met him, he was the opposite. He looked nothing like his pictures, he was very unattractive, rude and smelled bad. He didn\u2019t even wash his hands properly. The pay was good though, so I tried to force myself to tolerate him.\n\nBefore we slept together I started crying because I felt so horrible about the whole thing. He hugged me which made me feel even worse because I found him repulsive. I was gagging in the bathroom when I was getting ready to have sex with him. \n\nWhen we were about to do it he said that he \u201chas to cum inside of me\u201d. I said no at first but he kept insisting and I just wanted it to be over. He bought be a plan b pill but it was such a stupid decision. I don\u2019t know what I was thinking. I said to him that I don\u2019t want to meet him again and blocked him.\n\nI came home yesterday and I haven\u2019t been able to look at myself in the mirror. I feel like I\u2019m not the same anymore. I look at other people my age (19) and they seem so innocent and full of life, and I feel disgusting compared to them. I think I\u2019ve made the biggest mistake of my life and I don\u2019t know if I should continue.\nHas anyone else had similar feelings after their first time with a sugar daddy? Does it get better?",

It may help others learn from your experience.  \n\nThe best practices on this forum would be:\n\n - Don't do anything you are not comfortable with\n - Don't do anything that you hate just for money...it will eat away at your soul\n - Meet for an uncompensated platonic public M&G to verify you are both real and want to pursue an arrangement. \n - Respect your boundaries and stand your ground.  His pushing to go bare and cum inside you was way over the top and borderline assault. \n\nI hope sharing your story will help in your own recovery as a form of \"paying it forward\" to other potential SBs.",

While I haven\u2019t been in the bowl for a super long time, I\u2019ve been on enough dates to where I felt like I could comfortably establish boundaries with new sugar partners...Unfortunately that was not the case and recently I made a rookie mistake similar to the one you described here. \n\nIt\u2019s totally understandable to feel disgusting and question whether or not you should continue doing this. After all, this was a pretty traumatic event for you. However, he\u2019s ultimately the one at fault her for pressuring you to do something you\u2019re uncomfortable with. No matter how \u201cmature\u201d we may seem, we\u2019re still pretty young and some guys in the bowl will do everything they can to take advantage of us for that reason. Whether it be by offering a decent amount of financial support or through other pressures, they know it\u2019ll be hard for us to turn down those offers.\n\nThankfully there are plenty of guys (both in the lifestyle and outside of it) who are capable of taking no for an answer. This guy was not, and because of that he\u2019s a total asshole not even worthy of being called a SD. \n\nBut to answer your question, it does get better. The important thing to remember is that you at least tried to assert yourself, and I\u2019m sure it was clear to him that you did not want to have sex with him. Once you\u2019ve given yourself time to heal emotionally and physically, I think you should acknowledge the strength you showed by refusing him. It\u2019s hard to enforce boundaries but you did your best and that\u2019s something to be proud of; him pressuring you into saying yes doesn\u2019t negate that. \n\nIf you choose to continue sugaring be patient with yourself and only do things you\u2019re comfortable with. No amount of money can make up for what you had to endure with that repulsive individual. And even though you did endure something awful, I hope it can at least make it easier for you to continue setting boundaries in future arrangements. \ud83d\udd4a",

Now my situations were drastically different in the sense they weren't due to sugar dating. However, at the end of the day, you didn't actually give consent since you felt forced. Unfortunately the money aspect makes reporting your instances extra tricky. However the best advice I can give you is to call RAINN, a National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-4673 to talk to someone who will listen to you and be there for you. Please also get into therapy. That's what really helped me. You'll also have to go to therapy often before you start to feel like it's helping. I'm telling you this so you can stay consistent with it and not be discouraged after 2 or 3 sessions and feel like it's not helping. \n\nYou can also talk to me, I'm a woman in her 20s, but I understand that's probably not appropriate- I just don't want you to feel alone. We are all here for you, please ignore comments that are blaming you. 19 is incredibly young and while technically an adult, our brains are still in a very formative stage at this point. This is NOT your fault. Journaling can also be a very helpful tool.\n\nPlease take care of yourself in whatever ways that means to you and definitely avoid intimacy for awhile. I'm here if you'd like to chat further but try to use the resources of therapy and RAINN first and foremost simply because that's the safest options. While I know I'm not dangerous, I don't want you to start private messaging strangers online because you have no clue who they could be. You will get through this and honestly you will be stronger for it in the end. As far as SA, please don't use it again. There are many rapists on SA and it's not worth chancing for you.",

Maybe have an ounce of sympathy for someone in a worse off position before you jump to save the integrity of SDs when they have more power than most SBs ever have, in their sugar relationship or elsewhere. You can say that it isn\u2019t how sugar relationships are \u201csupposed\u201d to work, but it\u2019s how a vast majority DO work bc we live in a fucked up world where a lot of young women need extra cash and feel this is the only way they can earn it without breaking their back working multiple jobs.",

They uniformly get support with negative comments downvoted. \n\nThe scam stickies are more uniquely tailored to sugaring. Most profiles aren't rapists. A large amount of online interactions for SBs involve scamming. You classify the scams as rinsing making it sound like the stickies are primarily aimed at helping SDs not get rinsed. Of course, this isn't true. They're actually mostly aimed at helping SBs avoid getting scammed by giving their bank acct info or buying a bunch of gift cards, etc. \n\nI don't see anyone getting support by downplaying the severity of rape. But it isn't an outsized issue in sugaring. We're a supportive community when the topic comes up. And there are other communities where it makes more sense to tailor conversations around sexual assault specifically with stickies, etc. \n\nWe constantly post about best practices in terms of platonic meet and greets and letting people you trust know your whereabouts, etc.",

Therefore making  safety a valuable resource.   \nIf I go on a vanilla date and get assaulted, I can easily report the situation without feeling as I will be criminalized or demonized by society. If I go on a date with an older man for financial compensation and get assaulted I will be demonized by society and will not be taken seriously. Being assaulted in the sugaring world is far different than being assaulted in the vanilla dating world. Therefore safety resources should not only be addressed after a victim has been assaulted.",

The situation you posed isn't the fact scenario described in the OP. The OP described a series of prevarications. With the man deliberately putting the woman in a situation where he knew she would be less likely to express her agency and feel pressured to capitulate. That is, in fact, what happened. She convincingly describes being misled about his appearance, his demeanor, and the specifics of the sexual acts he would request of her. The timing and context of the revelations regarding his appearance, character, and sexual demands were absolutely calculated to erode the voluntariness of her consent. \n\nThey were calculated to benefit from her sunk cost fallacies and the decorous norms and etiquette of polite society. Perhaps most chillingly, they may have also involved a calculation regarding situations in which the victim would feel most physically threatened and thus least likely to offer any but the most tepid of resistance.",

In the second situation, I was blackout drunk and thus don't remember saying \"no\" but since the man who raped me then was a professor, he shouldn't have done it for many reasons. Even though I have said no in the past, I understand that for a multitude of factors exist that cause survivors the inability to say \"no.\" While many of us think that \"fight or flight\" are the only reactions we have when dealing with horrifying situations, there is also the very real case of people responding to such situations by freezing. Feel free to research that for yourself if you don't believe me.\n\nSince OP is very young, it's likely they haven't been in scary situations of this magnitude and thus didn't realize their response to fear is paralysis. OP also said they felt intimidated so please don't underestimate how that also factors into a situation like this. It also sounds like OP didn't have much experience prior and felt like this is just how most sugar babies feel. \n\nI genuinely hope no one you know is assaulted and I beg you not to respond in the matter you did to OP. Finally, looks like OP won't be reentering the bowl again which means this situation was scarring for them. Thus you saying OP should be able to \"extract themselves\" isn't that simple. Sometimes when we are intimidated or feel pressured, we do things we wouldn't want to do otherwise. And 19 year old is VERY young so you acting like it's easy for them just to leave something like this isn't always that simple.\n\nThis will likely traumatize OP for life and so saying things that will only add further trauma isn't helpful. When I was first raped, I was 18 and my rapist told me, \"I wasn't woman enough to handle him anyway.\" I've never forgotten that so please tread with nore care & empathy and less judgement as OP likely won't forget all the horrific judgement they're receiving.\n\nYou seem mature enough to really hear what I've said and I hope you'll read my message, take time to reflect, maybe even step away and re-evaluate your response before responding further.

Just make sure you draw the line before you compromise yourself into a bad experience again. \n\nAt the very least do a live video chat with any potential candidates so that if they've misrepresented themselves in pictures, you won't be in for a surprise. \n\nGood luck.\u2764",

He clearly did not see her as a person but as something to fuck. \n\nAre you saying that if you were the SD in a similar situation, you would proceed to have sex with a crying & nervous SB who is barely legal just b/c _technically_ it\u2019s still legal & _technically_ you received consent after continuing to push her boundaries till she does?\n\nEdit \u2014 that I misread the OP\u2019s post & thought it said he brought & not bought Plan B. But the fact that his solution to her not wanting him to cum inside of her is to buy her Plan B, which is not pleasant to take, instead of respecting her boundaries still speaks volumes.",

Maybe have an ounce of sympathy for someone in a worse off position before you jump to save the integrity of SDs when they have more power than most SBs ever have, in their sugar relationship or elsewhere. You can say that it isn\u2019t how sugar relationships are \u201csupposed\u201d to work, but it\u2019s how a vast majority DO work bc we live in a fucked up world where a lot of young women need extra cash and feel this is the only way they can earn it without breaking their back working multiple jobs.",

They uniformly get support with negative comments downvoted. \n\nThe scam stickies are more uniquely tailored to sugaring. Most profiles aren't rapists. A large amount of online interactions for SBs involve scamming. You classify the scams as rinsing making it sound like the stickies are primarily aimed at helping SDs not get rinsed. Of course, this isn't true. They're actually mostly aimed at helping SBs avoid getting scammed by giving their bank acct info or buying a bunch of gift cards, etc. \n\nI don't see anyone getting support by downplaying the severity of rape. But it isn't an outsized issue in sugaring. We're a supportive community when the topic comes up. And there are other communities where it makes more sense to tailor conversations around sexual assault specifically with stickies, etc. \n\nWe constantly post about best practices in terms of platonic meet and greets and letting people you trust know your whereabouts, etc.",

The situation you posed isn't the fact scenario described in the OP. The OP described a series of prevarications.

She convincingly describes being misled about his appearance, his demeanor, and the specifics of the sexual acts he would request of her. The timing and context of the revelations regarding his appearance, character, and sexual demands were absolutely calculated to erode the voluntariness of her consent. \n\nThey were calculated to benefit from her sunk cost fallacies and the decorous norms and etiquette of polite society. Perhaps most chillingly, they may have also involved a calculation regarding situations in which the victim would feel most physically threatened and thus least likely to offer any but the most tepid of resistance.",

In the second situation, I was blackout drunk and thus don't remember saying \"no\" but since the man who raped me then was a professor, he shouldn't have done it for many reasons. Even though I have said no in the past, I understand that for a multitude of factors exist that cause survivors the inability to say \"no.\" While many of us think that \"fight or flight\" are the only reactions we have when dealing with horrifying situations, there is also the very real case of people responding to such situations by freezing. Feel free to research that for yourself if you don't believe me.\n\nSince OP is very young, it's likely they haven't been in scary situations of this magnitude and thus didn't realize their response to fear is paralysis. OP also said they felt intimidated so please don't underestimate how that also factors into a situation like this. It also sounds like OP didn't have much experience prior and felt like this is just how most sugar babies feel. \n\nI genuinely hope no one you know is assaulted and I beg you not to respond in the matter you did to OP. Finally, looks like OP won't be reentering the bowl again which means this situation was scarring for them. Thus you saying OP should be able to \"extract themselves\" isn't that simple. Sometimes when we are intimidated or feel pressured, we do things we wouldn't want to do otherwise. And 19 year old is VERY young so you acting like it's easy for them just to leave something like this isn't always that simple.\n\nThis will likely traumatize OP for life and so saying things that will only add further trauma isn't helpful. When I was first raped, I was 18 and my rapist told me, \"I wasn't woman enough to handle him anyway.\" I've never forgotten that so please tread with nore care & empathy and less judgement as OP likely won't forget all the horrific judgement they're receiving.\n\nYou seem mature enough to really hear what I've said and I hope you'll read my message, take time to reflect, maybe even step away and re-evaluate your response before responding further.

Notice how old men will not fuck old women if they had the choice/money, remember menopause? Nature puts a stop to a female's ability to conceive as it becomes unhealthy and risky. \n\nAre you questioning whether a Woman chosing a man (or many) for his good genes is unhealthy OVER chosing a man for his ''sugar''? \n\nIn the end, we all fuck or get fucked for a mutual benefit whether it is ''sugar\" or whatever, at the expense of ''Dirt''",

They uniformly get support with negative comments downvoted. \n\nThe scam stickies are more uniquely tailored to sugaring. Most profiles aren't rapists. A large amount of online interactions for SBs involve scamming. You classify the scams as rinsing making it sound like the stickies are primarily aimed at helping SDs not get rinsed. Of course, this isn't true. They're actually mostly aimed at helping SBs avoid getting scammed by giving their bank acct info or buying a bunch of gift cards, etc. \n\nI don't see anyone getting support by downplaying the severity of rape. But it isn't an outsized issue in sugaring. We're a supportive community when the topic comes up. And there are other communities where it makes more sense to tailor conversations around sexual assault specifically with stickies, etc. \n\nWe constantly post about best practices in terms of platonic meet and greets and letting people you trust know your whereabouts, etc.",

Therefore making  safety a valuable resource.   \nIf I go on a vanilla date and get assaulted, I can easily report the situation without feeling as I will be criminalized or demonized by society. If I go on a date with an older man for financial compensation and get assaulted I will be demonized by society and will not be taken seriously. Being assaulted in the sugaring world is far different than being assaulted in the vanilla dating world. Therefore safety resources should not only be addressed after a victim has been assaulted.",

She convincingly describes being misled about his appearance, his demeanor, and the specifics of the sexual acts he would request of her. The timing and context of the revelations regarding his appearance, character, and sexual demands were absolutely calculated to erode the voluntariness of her consent. \n\nThey were calculated to benefit from her sunk cost fallacies and the decorous norms and etiquette of polite society. Perhaps most chillingly, they may have also involved a calculation regarding situations in which the victim would feel most physically threatened and thus least likely to offer any but the most tepid of resistance.",

In the second situation, I was blackout drunk and thus don't remember saying \"no\" but since the man who raped me then was a professor, he shouldn't have done it for many reasons. Even though I have said no in the past, I understand that for a multitude of factors exist that cause survivors the inability to say \"no.\" While many of us think that \"fight or flight\" are the only reactions we have when dealing with horrifying situations, there is also the very real case of people responding to such situations by freezing. Feel free to research that for yourself if you don't believe me.\n\nSince OP is very young, it's likely they haven't been in scary situations of this magnitude and thus didn't realize their response to fear is paralysis. OP also said they felt intimidated so please don't underestimate how that also factors into a situation like this. It also sounds like OP didn't have much experience prior and felt like this is just how most sugar babies feel. \n\nI genuinely hope no one you know is assaulted and I beg you not to respond in the matter you did to OP. Finally, looks like OP won't be reentering the bowl again which means this situation was scarring for them. Thus you saying OP should be able to \"extract themselves\" isn't that simple. Sometimes when we are intimidated or feel pressured, we do things we wouldn't want to do otherwise. And 19 year old is VERY young so you acting like it's easy for them just to leave something like this isn't always that simple.\n\nThis will likely traumatize OP for life and so saying things that will only add further trauma isn't helpful. When I was first raped, I was 18 and my rapist told me, \"I wasn't woman enough to handle him anyway.\" I've never forgotten that so please tread with nore care & empathy and less judgement as OP likely won't forget all the horrific judgement they're receiving.\n\nYou seem mature enough to really hear what I've said and I hope you'll read my message, take time to reflect, maybe even step away and re-evaluate your response before responding further.

He clearly did not see her as a person but as something to fuck. \n\nAre you saying that if you were the SD in a similar situation, you would proceed to have sex with a crying & nervous SB who is barely legal just b/c _technically_ it\u2019s still legal & _technically_ you received consent after continuing to push her boundaries till she does?\n\nEdit \u2014 that I misread the OP\u2019s post & thought it said he brought & not bought Plan B.

They uniformly get support with negative comments downvoted. \n\nThe scam stickies are more uniquely tailored to sugaring. Most profiles aren't rapists. A large amount of online interactions for SBs involve scamming. You classify the scams as rinsing making it sound like the stickies are primarily aimed at helping SDs not get rinsed. Of course, this isn't true. They're actually mostly aimed at helping SBs avoid getting scammed by giving their bank acct info or buying a bunch of gift cards, etc. \n\nI don't see anyone getting support by downplaying the severity of rape. But it isn't an outsized issue in sugaring. We're a supportive community when the topic comes up. And there are other communities where it makes more sense to tailor conversations around sexual assault specifically with stickies, etc. \n\nWe constantly post about best practices in terms of platonic meet and greets and letting people you trust know your whereabouts, etc.",

That is, in fact, what happened. She convincingly describes being misled about his appearance, his demeanor, and the specifics of the sexual acts he would request of her. The timing and context of the revelations regarding his appearance, character, and sexual demands were absolutely calculated to erode the voluntariness of her consent. \n\nThey were calculated to benefit from her sunk cost fallacies and the decorous norms and etiquette of polite society. Perhaps most chillingly, they may have also involved a calculation regarding situations in which the victim would feel most physically threatened and thus least likely to offer any but the most tepid of resistance.",

In the second situation, I was blackout drunk and thus don't remember saying \"no\" but since the man who raped me then was a professor, he shouldn't have done it for many reasons. Even though I have said no in the past, I understand that for a multitude of factors exist that cause survivors the inability to say \"no.\" While many of us think that \"fight or flight\" are the only reactions we have when dealing with horrifying situations, there is also the very real case of people responding to such situations by freezing. Feel free to research that for yourself if you don't believe me.\n\nSince OP is very young, it's likely they haven't been in scary situations of this magnitude and thus didn't realize their response to fear is paralysis. OP also said they felt intimidated so please don't underestimate how that also factors into a situation like this. It also sounds like OP didn't have much experience prior and felt like this is just how most sugar babies feel. \n\nI genuinely hope no one you know is assaulted and I beg you not to respond in the matter you did to OP. Finally, looks like OP won't be reentering the bowl again which means this situation was scarring for them. Thus you saying OP should be able to \"extract themselves\" isn't that simple. Sometimes when we are intimidated or feel pressured, we do things we wouldn't want to do otherwise. And 19 year old is VERY young so you acting like it's easy for them just to leave something like this isn't always that simple.\n\nThis will likely traumatize OP for life and so saying things that will only add further trauma isn't helpful. When I was first raped, I was 18 and my rapist told me, \"I wasn't woman enough to handle him anyway.\" I've never forgotten that so please tread with nore care & empathy and less judgement as OP likely won't forget all the horrific judgement they're receiving.\n\nYou seem mature enough to really hear what I've said and I hope you'll read my message, take time to reflect, maybe even step away and re-evaluate your response before responding further.

A large amount of online interactions for SBs involve scamming. You classify the scams as rinsing making it sound like the stickies are primarily aimed at helping SDs not get rinsed. Of course, this isn't true. They're actually mostly aimed at helping SBs avoid getting scammed by giving their bank acct info or buying a bunch of gift cards, etc. \n\nI don't see anyone getting support by downplaying the severity of rape. But it isn't an outsized issue in sugaring. We're a supportive community when the topic comes up. And there are other communities where it makes more sense to tailor conversations around sexual assault specifically with stickies, etc. \n\nWe constantly post about best practices in terms of platonic meet and greets and letting people you trust know your whereabouts, etc.",

In the second situation, I was blackout drunk and thus don't remember saying \"no\" but since the man who raped me then was a professor, he shouldn't have done it for many reasons. Even though I have said no in the past, I understand that for a multitude of factors exist that cause survivors the inability to say \"no.\" While many of us think that \"fight or flight\" are the only reactions we have when dealing with horrifying situations, there is also the very real case of people responding to such situations by freezing. Feel free to research that for yourself if you don't believe me.\n\nSince OP is very young, it's likely they haven't been in scary situations of this magnitude and thus didn't realize their response to fear is paralysis. OP also said they felt intimidated so please don't underestimate how that also factors into a situation like this. It also sounds like OP didn't have much experience prior and felt like this is just how most sugar babies feel. \n\nI genuinely hope no one you know is assaulted and I beg you not to respond in the matter you did to OP. Finally, looks like OP won't be reentering the bowl again which means this situation was scarring for them. Thus you saying OP should be able to \"extract themselves\" isn't that simple. Sometimes when we are intimidated or feel pressured, we do things we wouldn't want to do otherwise. And 19 year old is VERY young so you acting like it's easy for them just to leave something like this isn't always that simple.\n\nThis will likely traumatize OP for life and so saying things that will only add further trauma isn't helpful. When I was first raped, I was 18 and my rapist told me, \"I wasn't woman enough to handle him anyway.\" I've never forgotten that so please tread with nore care & empathy and less judgement as OP likely won't forget all the horrific judgement they're receiving.\n\nYou seem mature enough to really hear what I've said and I hope you'll read my message, take time to reflect, maybe even step away and re-evaluate your response before responding further.

            "body": "I have been raped twice. In the first situation, I said \"no\" and \"stop\" multiple times and was ignored. In the second situation, I was blackout drunk and thus don't remember saying \"no\" but since the man who raped me then was a professor, he shouldn't have done it for many reasons. Even though I have said no in the past, I understand that for a multitude of factors exist that cause survivors the inability to say \"no.\" While many of us think that \"fight or flight\" are the only reactions we have when dealing with horrifying situations, there is also the very real case of people responding to such situations by freezing. Feel free to research that for yourself if you don't believe me.\n\nSince OP is very young, it's likely they haven't been in scary situations of this magnitude and thus didn't realize their response to fear is paralysis. OP also said they felt intimidated so please don't underestimate how that also factors into a situation like this. It also sounds like OP didn't have much experience prior and felt like this is just how most sugar babies feel. \n\nI genuinely hope no one you know is assaulted and I beg you not to respond in the matter you did to OP. Finally, looks like OP won't be reentering the bowl again which means this situation was scarring for them. Thus you saying OP should be able to \"extract themselves\" isn't that simple. Sometimes when we are intimidated or feel pressured, we do things we wouldn't want to do otherwise. And 19 year old is VERY young so you acting like it's easy for them just to leave something like this isn't always that simple.\n\nThis will likely traumatize OP for life and so saying things that will only add further trauma isn't helpful. When I was first raped, I was 18 and my rapist told me, \"I wasn't woman enough to handle him anyway.\" I've never forgotten that so please tread with nore care & empathy and less judgement as OP likely won't forget all the horrific judgement they're receiving.\n\nYou seem mature enough to really hear what I've said and I hope you'll read my message, take time to reflect, maybe even step away and re-evaluate your response before responding further. Thank-you.",

The OP described a series of prevarications. With the man deliberately putting the woman in a situation where he knew she would be less likely to express her agency and feel pressured to capitulate. That is, in fact, what happened. She convincingly describes being misled about his appearance, his demeanor, and the specifics of the sexual acts he would request of her. The timing and context of the revelations regarding his appearance, character, and sexual demands were absolutely calculated to erode the voluntariness of her consent. \n\nThey were calculated to benefit from her sunk cost fallacies and the decorous norms and etiquette of polite society. Perhaps most chillingly, they may have also involved a calculation regarding situations in which the victim would feel most physically threatened and thus least likely to offer any but the most tepid of resistance.",
