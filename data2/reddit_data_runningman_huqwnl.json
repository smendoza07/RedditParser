Cuz when JiHyo was grabbing for her life, she says it was a blue balloon, but he says it\u2019s yellow. We don\u2019t know if she\u2019s really the sister or getting this info wrong or manipulated from the psychiatrist. She says if she dies, he\u2019ll never know. At the conclusion, he decides to shred the true DNA test result. He did this test using her hair and his saliva swab, he chooses to not know (and the viewer not to know) if JiHyo is the sister or not. !<",
