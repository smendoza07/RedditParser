It would amplify the demure vibe and break up the consistency in the rest of the photos a bit.\n\nAll the others are great!!",

I your care with your face and body fully shaded is usually a good one. Take it with your arm fully extended and slightly above eye level. \nCenter left - Crop it to just above your bellybutton. The shadow is unflattering in your waist.\nCenter right - GREAT!\nBottom left - I agree with the other comments, remove.\nBottom right - good, keep.",

They aren\u2019t exposed to that artsier selfie aesthetic. Also, older men are all about the smile. \n\nThe white dress shot is not flattering to your midriff and many boomer men will find that you look unapproachable because you\u2019re not making eye contact and you\u2019re not smiling. \n\nThe diner shot doesn\u2019t showcase you as \u201cgorgeous yet down-to-earth\u201d arm candy like the other images do. \n\nLove your choice for primary profile pic!!",
