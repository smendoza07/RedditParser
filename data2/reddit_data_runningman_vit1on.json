However, the premise didn't sound like a comedy to me. Three people from the lower classes of society; one is a struggling single mother of two with an addiction, one in an abusive relationship, one inexperienced and completely na\u00efve... In addition, the lead actress is the mother from Sky Castle (I only watched a few episode) and JSM, who has mostly done dramas and not comedies. Unless the show was marketed as a comedy series, I don't think any of the signs from the cast to the storyline point to it being one. A dramedy perhaps, but it mostly sounds like a drama about the society, class differences, family dynamics and friendships. \n\nI also haven't watched the original UK versio in full, but from what I did see, the lead character is in fact a selfish and horrible person. I watched world of marriage (because of Dreamcatcher making a parody of it!) and quickly realized it's based on Dr Foster, which was fantastic. (I'm a huge fan of Suranne and Jodie) The Korean remake actually followed the show almost exactly, so I'm thinking they won't deviate from the story that much. which means, that is the character: A person who lies and cheats others with a justification that sounds convincing only to prove she can't be trusted because she will then gamble it all away or just waste it all.",

When meeting someone for the first time and getting to know them, using MBTI, Zodiac, and blood type as a conversation starter is a great way to ask someone what their personality is like without literally saying \"What is your personality like?\". For a culture that hates wasted time, it opens up the discussion to talk about whether someone is more outgoing, logical, reserved, confrontational, and etc.\n\n\n**this is from last year (2020) ..i dont follow this news but read it by coincident .\ud83d\udc47\n\n\"We hire by checking your MBTI type.

Exceptions: ENTJ, ESFJ types cannot apply.\u201d\n\nThis was part of a notice for a part-time job opening posted by a caf\u00e9 in Mapo-gu, Seoul. People showed mixed reactions to this notice. Some said they could understand since the MBTI has firmly taken root as a common topic of interest, while others argued that it was just a leisure activity and that a personality test should not be applied as a recruitment standard.",

They talked about JSM ripping a nametag of someone she disliked very early in a game at one point. I'm trying to rack my brain as to when she's ever done this, and all I can think of is her ripping LKS's nametag in the TWICE episode literally 2 minutes into the game.

However, the premise didn't sound like a comedy to me. Three people from the lower classes of society; one is a struggling single mother of two with an addiction, one in an abusive relationship, one inexperienced and completely na\u00efve... In addition, the lead actress is the mother from Sky Castle (I only watched a few episode) and JSM, who has mostly done dramas and not comedies. Unless the show was marketed as a comedy series, I don't think any of the signs from the cast to the storyline point to it being one. A dramedy perhaps, but it mostly sounds like a drama about the society, class differences, family dynamics and friendships. \n\nI also haven't watched the original UK versio in full, but from what I did see, the lead character is in fact a selfish and horrible person. I watched world of marriage (because of Dreamcatcher making a parody of it!) and quickly realized it's based on Dr Foster, which was fantastic. (I'm a huge fan of Suranne and Jodie) The Korean remake actually followed the show almost exactly, so I'm thinking they won't deviate from the story that much. which means, that is the character: A person who lies and cheats others with a justification that sounds convincing only to prove she can't be trusted because she will then gamble it all away or just waste it all.",

For a culture that hates wasted time, it opens up the discussion to talk about whether someone is more outgoing, logical, reserved, confrontational, and etc.\n\n\n**this is from last year (2020) ..i dont follow this news but read it by coincident .\ud83d\udc47\n\n\"We hire by checking your MBTI type.

However, the premise didn't sound like a comedy to me. Three people from the lower classes of society; one is a struggling single mother of two with an addiction, one in an abusive relationship, one inexperienced and completely na\u00efve... In addition, the lead actress is the mother from Sky Castle (I only watched a few episode) and JSM, who has mostly done dramas and not comedies. Unless the show was marketed as a comedy series, I don't think any of the signs from the cast to the storyline point to it being one. A dramedy perhaps, but it mostly sounds like a drama about the society, class differences, family dynamics and friendships. \n\nI also haven't watched the original UK versio in full, but from what I did see, the lead character is in fact a selfish and horrible person. I watched world of marriage (because of Dreamcatcher making a parody of it!) and quickly realized it's based on Dr Foster, which was fantastic. (I'm a huge fan of Suranne and Jodie) The Korean remake actually followed the show almost exactly, so I'm thinking they won't deviate from the story that much. which means, that is the character: A person who lies and cheats others with a justification that sounds convincing only to prove she can't be trusted because she will then gamble it all away or just waste it all.",
