I stopped cutting my hair around january 2019, and it was already somewhat long at that point. awkward stage wasn\u2019t that bad for me but it was still annoying. just push through it and you\u2019ll be fine, don\u2019t get any trims until you\u2019re satisfied with the length and want to even it out a bit. enjoy your hair growth journey, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll rock it",
