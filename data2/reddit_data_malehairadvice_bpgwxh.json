Most people liked it, some loved it, a few hated it, and a lot of people called me Chad...\n\nIn the end, I wasn't a fan of the spikes and couldn't reproduce them with the product I like to use anyway. So I've gone back to my usual with a fade. Its been like this for a few years now and I think I like it enough to keep it for a few more.",
