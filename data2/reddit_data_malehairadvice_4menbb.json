I go to a girly hair salon but I have long hair.\n\nMath:\n\nThink of it this way: You might buy a shirt for $20, that you don't have any problem paying. Lets say you wear the shirt 1/7 days of the week for 6 months. $20 lasts you 26 wearings. ($0.76/wear)\n\n~~You wear the hair on your head *every day.* 7/7 days of the week, and you get it cut every 6 months. 7d * 26w = 182 wearings. Per day, the equivalent value for the shirt would be a $138 haircut. ($138 / 182 wearings = $0.76/wear)~~\n\nTherefore: Don't be afraid to splurge on a haircut, because it's per-day usage is high compared to a cheaper clothing item.\n\nEDIT: I forgot that normal people cut their hair every 4-6 weeks. so the new math should be, for an equivalent $0.76 shirt:\n\n7/7 days of the week, for ~5 weeks, is (x/35 wearings = $0.76/wear), so ~$46 haircut would give you the equivalent of a $20 shirt's worth of weekly wearings.\n\nAnyways, the point still stands but now my math is correct.",

I go to a girly hair salon but I have long hair.\n\nMath:\n\nThink of it this way: You might buy a shirt for $20, that you don't have any problem paying. Lets say you wear the shirt 1/7 days of the week for 6 months. $20 lasts you 26 wearings. ($0.76/wear)\n\n~~You wear the hair on your head *every day.* 7/7 days of the week, and you get it cut every 6 months. 7d * 26w = 182 wearings. Per day, the equivalent value for the shirt would be a $138 haircut. ($138 / 182 wearings = $0.76/wear)~~\n\nTherefore: Don't be afraid to splurge on a haircut, because it's per-day usage is high compared to a cheaper clothing item.\n\nEDIT: I forgot that normal people cut their hair every 4-6 weeks. so the new math should be, for an equivalent $0.76 shirt:\n\n7/7 days of the week, for ~5 weeks, is (x/35 wearings = $0.76/wear), so ~$46 haircut would give you the equivalent of a $20 shirt's worth of weekly wearings.\n\nAnyways, the point still stands but now my math is correct.",

I get a pretty boring/standard haircut but I keep going just because they really take their time and it feels like they know what they're doing.  I pay \u00a315 for the cut and \u00a33 in bus fares when I could get a cut at a walking-distance barber for \u00a37.  These kinds of barbers aren't common, but they do exist.  Just research what's in your area.\n\nI fucking love my barber.  They have skateboards on the walls, an arcade machine and free beers.",

I go to a girly hair salon but I have long hair.\n\nMath:\n\nThink of it this way: You might buy a shirt for $20, that you don't have any problem paying. Lets say you wear the shirt 1/7 days of the week for 6 months. $20 lasts you 26 wearings. ($0.76/wear)\n\n~~You wear the hair on your head *every day.* 7/7 days of the week, and you get it cut every 6 months. 7d * 26w = 182 wearings. Per day, the equivalent value for the shirt would be a $138 haircut. ($138 / 182 wearings = $0.76/wear)~~\n\nTherefore: Don't be afraid to splurge on a haircut, because it's per-day usage is high compared to a cheaper clothing item.\n\nEDIT: I forgot that normal people cut their hair every 4-6 weeks. so the new math should be, for an equivalent $0.76 shirt:\n\n7/7 days of the week, for ~5 weeks, is (x/35 wearings = $0.76/wear), so ~$46 haircut would give you the equivalent of a $20 shirt's worth of weekly wearings.\n\nAnyways, the point still stands but now my math is correct.",
