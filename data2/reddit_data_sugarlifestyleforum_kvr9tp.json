    "body": "I have been with my SD for some time now and I absolutely love this man and hope to continue seeing him. That\u2019s the reason why I was so scared to ask for a raise in my allowance , that I\u2019d push him away. So I finally went for it yesterday after much thought and planning. I even had practiced a whole pitch \ud83d\ude05 . When the moment was right, I pitched my heart away. He asked questions such as what %, etc and I tried to answer them as best I could. \nHe laughed. And said yes! \nThen we went on to talk so much about asking for raises and promotions at work, negotiating salaries etc. He told me about his previous experiences on the same when he was still climbing the ladder. And now, as a top executive how he would respond to such requests and what he\u2019d consider when evaluating the same. \nThis is why I love sugar \ud83d\udc95 . Access to $ and also a wealth of knowledge!\n\nEDIT: thank you all for your love and the awards!!",

Work on increasing your value over time and record your accomplishments. \n2. Pitch what value you have added so far and how you can add more in the future . \n2. Timing is everything. Ask at the right moment. \n3. Be specific and confident about what you want \n4. If you have other options at hand , you may creatively leverage that to show your value \n5. Number 5 may backfire, so be ready for that, and also for a No.",
