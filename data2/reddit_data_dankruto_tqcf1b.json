Dudes a wanted war criminal who was only spared Because he killed the first alien and Naruto would risk his life to defend sauskes and noone wants to fuck with Naruto. Dude has a lot of innate reasons to not want to join the village. You can see in some filler episodes that he's trying to work on it, but ultimately 20 years of isolation will wreck your social abilities.

Dudes a wanted war criminal who was only spared Because he killed the first alien and Naruto would risk his life to defend sauskes and noone wants to fuck with Naruto. Dude has a lot of innate reasons to not want to join the village. You can see in some filler episodes that he's trying to work on it, but ultimately 20 years of isolation will wreck your social abilities.

Since Boruto is marketed towards children and early teens, subtlety isn't a thing in Boruto. So a character like Sasuke is literally there to appeal to dumb readers who can't comprehend subtlety in storytelling.\n\nRather than having Sasuke interact with his environment like an adult human would, while still portraying his solitary nature resulting from the Uchiha massacre. \n\nBut that requires subtlety, which goes over many viewers head, especially children and young teens.",

Dudes a wanted war criminal who was only spared Because he killed the first alien and Naruto would risk his life to defend sauskes and noone wants to fuck with Naruto. Dude has a lot of innate reasons to not want to join the village. You can see in some filler episodes that he's trying to work on it, but ultimately 20 years of isolation will wreck your social abilities.

Then he was alone by himself hunting aliens for like a decade after not being allowed to return to the village because he kinda tried to kill all the kage. Dudes a wanted war criminal who was only spared Because he killed the first alien and Naruto would risk his life to defend sauskes and noone wants to fuck with Naruto. Dude has a lot of innate reasons to not want to join the village. You can see in some filler episodes that he's trying to work on it, but ultimately 20 years of isolation will wreck your social abilities. Gonna probably get some more development in this half of Boruto.",
