    "body": "Rant\n\nSo I met up with my SD recently. He is married  with 2 children and I've known this from the beginning. We've been together since December and all this time i never gave much thought regarding his regular life. It was just 'us' when we were together in our blissful little world haha \n\nAnyway, before our most recent meet up I looked up his social media and saw pictures of his wife and kids. Didn't really feel anything other than thinking 'aww that's nice' and moved on. \n\nWe met up this week it was great, the sex was mind blowing  he is generous, kind etc etc. I was on a high. But after he left i felt this horrible crashing feeling and started thinking about who he is going home to and though he told me why he is having an affair, it really hurt to think his wife gets to enjoy a side of him i may never will doing normal things like walking the dogs and watching tv without the time constraints. I wouldn't say I'm in love with him, but i care deeply for him and it just sucked that i now have a mental picture of what his normal life is like. I literally went from a 100 to 0 haha and even cried \n\nAnd yes i should have thought about this before getting involved with a married man. Since i have no one to tell just wanted somewhere to vent my feelings",

And yes, they must chase career but believe me, once you are a dreamgirl to one of them you will experience some real special treatment. But the fact that you are their dream girl does not mean they are what you want. And yeah, they do not give a damn about escorting. Maybe do your research how many wives of high earning men were escorts, and how many of them actually met at work. Of course it wont be written explicitly. It is like the movie breakfast at tiffanys which is about escort, and so many people do not get it lol :D. But yeah, the reason why I say not impossible is because for some it will be easier then for others. I do not know how the girls looks like, how are their manners, intelligence, social skills etc. If you are model material with rubbish personality your chances are low.",

It\u2019s ok to \u201ccatch feelings\u201d but as someone who was in this dilemma with an old divorced SD is that I only cared about the money, while he just only cared about being involved in my sex life only. He admitted to me before that he\u2019d like a \u201crelationship in the future\u201d but all of his energy and actions towards me were just geared to have a \u2018sexual life\u2019 with me. I too said I wanted \u201ca relationship\u201d but I knew for a fact it was only for his money, anything else that wasn\u2019t money-related nor materialistic I wouldn\u2019t even be talking to him in the first place.\n\nWe had an argument and after that I just left. My feelings did linger on what could\u2019ve been the infinite in the unknown but all I have left from him is saved money, 2 high-end necklaces, and memories of an old man taking me to eat then \u201chaving fun\u201d. We had a sexual relationship, not a romantic one. Anyone could f*ck anyone especially in this day and age where \u2018side chicks\u2019 are pretty ubiquitous but never acknowledged to be a \u201cserious thing\u201d.\n\nI love how you knew what you were getting involved in because it shows \u2018acceptance\u2019. But you need to not make this life of simply just being a mistress of the situation into something bigger. Sugaring will always be a temporary thing no matter how much ppl like to romanticize it and prolong it. It sounds to me that you grew attached because you only have this arrangement as the only thing being \u201cexciting\u201d in your life. SDs aren\u2019t into the fact of marriage nor long term commitment, both SBs and SDs are in this lifestyle for a \u2018good time\u2019 not a long time.\n\nMy three biggest advice for you: (1) Social media is the worst place to lurk for anyone\u2019s business, especially when you\u2019re growing an attachment to that person. Block everything and harness your social media usage. Lurking around a space where everything is artificial is the worst thing you could do with your real emotions and mental health. (2) Most things that don\u2019t work are just better off being that way. Things that don\u2019t work out, don\u2019t work out for a reason and you must accept it and either move on or waste your life on it whilst the other person is already moving through the next phase. Don\u2019t try to force it. Don\u2019t complicate it. When the \u201cfun\u201d ends, make closure with it and move on. (3) Build your own life not a life that\u2019s already been established. Don\u2019t make it around sugaring because as you get older you\u2019ll just see yourself as a person being only used for intimacy, not a real connection. Yes you may have fallen in love with a married man but not to be a Debby Downer, who\u2019s to say he\u2019s still looking for intimacy from various other people? He went on a website to cheat on his wife. He gave you and thousands of other SBs a chance for him to carry on his infidelities. You deserve more than that, trust me.",

In a typical SR, the SD won't burden you with his real-life concerns. So he may not ask you about college funds, retirement goals, or his sciatica. Maybe those stolen moments with you are his very best?  \n\nJust ignore social media. No one wants to post photos of the bad, ugly, hard stuff in real family life. Behind that happy photo of walking the dogs or kids playing in the park, there's the sad reality of feeding screaming kids or cleaning up dog diarrhea on the bed.",

My rodeo girl, SB 2, lives in our garage apartment; she pays rent every month but I give it back to her.  It\u2019s kind of a polite fiction so her parents don\u2019t have to acknowledge that she\u2019s a SB.  SB1 has an apartment but she\u2019s at the house almost daily.  Her apartment complex won\u2019t allow dogs bigger than 30 lbs so her dog (black lab) stays with me.  Her other option is her mother\u2019s house, which is 80 miles away.  This way her dog has a couple acres to run around on and she can see her fur baby almost every day instead of a few times a month.\n\nThe SBs regularly eat meals with us; we grocery shop for the family plus them.  They do their laundry here.  They\u2019ve gone hiking, camping, and boating with my family.\n\nThe biggest drawback for the SBs is my wife will talk their ears off about doTERRA essential oils or Youngevity.\n\nI suspect most SBs wouldn\u2019t want to be this close to their SD and his family.",

I should clarify; we have a detached garage with an apartment over it.  She\u2019s not involved in the sexual part, although she has watched a few times.  She would be willing to do more but the SBs aren\u2019t willing.  For years before this developed she had a cuckquean fantasy, and she intentionally put temptation in my path on multiple occasions.  I never went for it.  Eight years ago I found out that she had had two affairs years earlier, one with her boss in the first couple years of our marriage and the second one with a neighbor while I was in Afghanistan.  We came really close to a divorce.  If it wasn\u2019t for the kids, I would have left.  Marriage counseling, a lot of honesty, working out anger, bitterness, and resentment.  We did relationship workshops and did a lot of reading.  \u2018Passionate Marriage\u2019 by David Schnarch and \u2018Come as You Are\u2019 by Emily Nagoski are both books I recommend.\n\nOur marriage obviously survived but changed.  Before, our relationship was pure vanilla.  I had been pretty kinky before our marriage but she was very religious when we met and I gave that up for her.  I brought kink into the bedroom.  I learned to be a Master in the BDSM sense.  We started going to Dungeons.  After a couple years of working on our relationship we decided to try swinging and swapping.  We started out very cautiously and talked constantly every step of the way.  We had to be extremely discreet because I was still on active duty in the military, and I could have been prosecuted for adultery.  We still swing and swap but not often.\n\nI think that on some level her acceptance of the SRs is penance on her part for the affairs she had, like she deserves to feel the angst.  I think that had a lot to do with her putting temptation in my path years earlier.\n\nShe has a current relationship with a guy from FetLife that I have met once, at the beginning of their relationship to lay down the ground rules.  TBH I\u2019m not happy about it but I permit it.  He does things for her that I have a hard time doing.  I deal with it by not thinking about it, and she doesn\u2019t tell me anything about it because I don\u2019t want to know.\n\nIt isn\u2019t all champagne and roses.",

I look forward to the escape of sugar and look forward to the stability of my family.  In my case, both are amazing.\n\nWhen I started in this life sugar was amazing and home sucked.  The joy of my sugar time made me realize I had to get more deliberate about making normal life great too.\n\nMy thermostat wanted to bring down sugaring because it was too good. It seems you may be trying to do that.  Your fantasy is about what you don't have.  I highly encourage you to work hard at making your other time amazing.\n\nI hope that makes sense.\n\nWe can have it all in life, but it requires different parts of ourselves being filled in different ways.  No one aspect will do it all.  You and I are complicated. Treat each part well and you'll be high much more often.\n\nBest of luck to you. I hope you can find a way to process your feeling and continue to add to your life.",

But the fact that you are their dream girl does not mean they are what you want. And yeah, they do not give a damn about escorting. Maybe do your research how many wives of high earning men were escorts, and how many of them actually met at work. Of course it wont be written explicitly. It is like the movie breakfast at tiffanys which is about escort, and so many people do not get it lol :D. But yeah, the reason why I say not impossible is because for some it will be easier then for others. I do not know how the girls looks like, how are their manners, intelligence, social skills etc. If you are model material with rubbish personality your chances are low.",

Stanley created a big family with his four women , each left him offsprings and they are all properly recorded in the family tree.",

I should clarify; we have a detached garage with an apartment over it.  She\u2019s not involved in the sexual part, although she has watched a few times.  She would be willing to do more but the SBs aren\u2019t willing.  For years before this developed she had a cuckquean fantasy, and she intentionally put temptation in my path on multiple occasions.  I never went for it.  Eight years ago I found out that she had had two affairs years earlier, one with her boss in the first couple years of our marriage and the second one with a neighbor while I was in Afghanistan.  We came really close to a divorce.  If it wasn\u2019t for the kids, I would have left.  Marriage counseling, a lot of honesty, working out anger, bitterness, and resentment.  We did relationship workshops and did a lot of reading.  \u2018Passionate Marriage\u2019 by David Schnarch and \u2018Come as You Are\u2019 by Emily Nagoski are both books I recommend.\n\nOur marriage obviously survived but changed.  Before, our relationship was pure vanilla.  I had been pretty kinky before our marriage but she was very religious when we met and I gave that up for her.  I brought kink into the bedroom.  I learned to be a Master in the BDSM sense.  We started going to Dungeons.  After a couple years of working on our relationship we decided to try swinging and swapping.  We started out very cautiously and talked constantly every step of the way.  We had to be extremely discreet because I was still on active duty in the military, and I could have been prosecuted for adultery.  We still swing and swap but not often.\n\nI think that on some level her acceptance of the SRs is penance on her part for the affairs she had, like she deserves to feel the angst.  I think that had a lot to do with her putting temptation in my path years earlier.\n\nShe has a current relationship with a guy from FetLife that I have met once, at the beginning of their relationship to lay down the ground rules.  TBH I\u2019m not happy about it but I permit it.  He does things for her that I have a hard time doing.  I deal with it by not thinking about it, and she doesn\u2019t tell me anything about it because I don\u2019t want to know.\n\nIt isn\u2019t all champagne and roses.",

Maybe do your research how many wives of high earning men were escorts, and how many of them actually met at work. Of course it wont be written explicitly. It is like the movie breakfast at tiffanys which is about escort, and so many people do not get it lol :D. But yeah, the reason why I say not impossible is because for some it will be easier then for others.

In many religious or historical contexts, a man owns multi women because of gender inequality. For example, women can\u2019t inherit land or properties. And many women were forced to share a man. \n\nBut if they are not forced and everyone knows exactly what\u2019s going on, you will have the empire Stanley Ho created. \n\nIn reality, it\u2019s extremely hard work to have more than one women (this different from group sex you are talking about ) .. Stanley created a big family with his four women , each left him offsprings and they are all properly recorded in the family tree.",

I should clarify; we have a detached garage with an apartment over it.  She\u2019s not involved in the sexual part, although she has watched a few times.  She would be willing to do more but the SBs aren\u2019t willing.  For years before this developed she had a cuckquean fantasy, and she intentionally put temptation in my path on multiple occasions.  I never went for it.  Eight years ago I found out that she had had two affairs years earlier, one with her boss in the first couple years of our marriage and the second one with a neighbor while I was in Afghanistan.  We came really close to a divorce.  If it wasn\u2019t for the kids, I would have left.  Marriage counseling, a lot of honesty, working out anger, bitterness, and resentment.  We did relationship workshops and did a lot of reading.  \u2018Passionate Marriage\u2019 by David Schnarch and \u2018Come as You Are\u2019 by Emily Nagoski are both books I recommend.\n\nOur marriage obviously survived but changed.  Before, our relationship was pure vanilla.  I had been pretty kinky before our marriage but she was very religious when we met and I gave that up for her.  I brought kink into the bedroom.  I learned to be a Master in the BDSM sense.  We started going to Dungeons.  After a couple years of working on our relationship we decided to try swinging and swapping.  We started out very cautiously and talked constantly every step of the way.  We had to be extremely discreet because I was still on active duty in the military, and I could have been prosecuted for adultery.  We still swing and swap but not often.\n\nI think that on some level her acceptance of the SRs is penance on her part for the affairs she had, like she deserves to feel the angst.  I think that had a lot to do with her putting temptation in my path years earlier.\n\nShe has a current relationship with a guy from FetLife that I have met once, at the beginning of their relationship to lay down the ground rules.  TBH I\u2019m not happy about it but I permit it.  He does things for her that I have a hard time doing.  I deal with it by not thinking about it, and she doesn\u2019t tell me anything about it because I don\u2019t want to know.\n\nIt isn\u2019t all champagne and roses.",

It is like the movie breakfast at tiffanys which is about escort, and so many people do not get it lol :D.

Maybe do your research how many wives of high earning men were escorts, and how many of them actually met at work. Of course it wont be written explicitly. It is like the movie breakfast at tiffanys which is about escort, and so many people do not get it lol :D. But yeah, the reason why I say not impossible is because for some it will be easier then for others.

In many religious or historical contexts, a man owns multi women because of gender inequality. For example, women can\u2019t inherit land or properties. And many women were forced to share a man. \n\nBut if they are not forced and everyone knows exactly what\u2019s going on, you will have the empire Stanley Ho created. \n\nIn reality, it\u2019s extremely hard work to have more than one women (this different from group sex you are talking about ) .. Stanley created a big family with his four women , each left him offsprings and they are all properly recorded in the family tree.",
