    "body": "So, there was a SD who messaged me. We talked, and both figured out quickly we both wanted the same things. Well because of my job and lack of time and his busy life running multiple businesses, meet and greets kept falling through. But on Thursday he asked if he could meet me before work (6:15am) for coffee. I said absolutely yes. So we meet, he is much more handsome in person, which I was excited about. We met, and it felt so natural. We both chatted about work, and life stuff. Then I had to head out because of work. He messages me 2 hrs later asking if he can see me quickly because he wanted to pay for my hair appt on Saturday (today). I told him how sweet that was of him and made arrangement for him to meet me. He drove up, said he was sorry he was late for the meet, I told him no worries and I hope is afternoon does not get too crazy and he has an awesome day. He then gently hands me an envelope and said here you go, go enjoy your salon appt on me. I was just blown away by him really. His demeanor, personality, everything. I'm so excited to see him again and spend time with him, just because I truly enjoy him. So anyways, I just wanted to share my successful match \u2764 thank you to everyone for all the advice and support that is provided here!",
