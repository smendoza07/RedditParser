    "body": "We see this question a lot, and a lot of times by surprisingly young women / people. No you are not too old, unless you are retirement age / close to it, then yeah you probably are for the majority. \n\nYes, there are a lot of SDs who prefer them young. And that's fine. But plenty are open to late 20s on up crowd (using that as a loose age, since that's when we see a lot of women asking the question). I know some guys, such as me, prefer a woman with some life experience / maturity etc... vs. Immaturity, naivety,  flakeness etc...\n\nBut the elephant in the room crux of this question shouldn't be are you too old, but rather are you attractive enough? \n\nThe bowl is a shallow place by in large. Age is relatively irrelevant, but looks are not. Looks get you in the door. \n\nSo instead of \"Am I too old?\" Maybe think \"Do I look good at my age?\" E.g., a 40 something frumpy house frau type, OR a hot 40 something fitness guru. \n\nIf the former you will have problems finding an SD, if the latter you shouldn't have problems finding an SD, and may even attract someone a little younger than you.\n\nGood luck.",

People meeting me usually assume I\u2019m in my late 30s, early 40s, and although a lot of that is attitude and interests, I do have a boyish face and a decent level of fitness. \n\nI\u2019ve had SBs and pots from 18-42. Honestly, the very best looking of them was probably a 6 and the worst about a 3. It turns out what\u2019s made the difference between the keepers and rejects isn\u2019t age or appearance, per se, but attitude and intelligence. The plump but cute 18 year old with an agile mind, a love of experimentation, and a sex drive that\u2019d put a rabbit to shame was a a keeper. The model trim 22 year old with a beautiful face that couldn\u2019t understand what I did for a living and had a lot of bizarre rules for sex was not a keeper. The tall, gangly, and bespectacled 30 year old whose only physical calling cards were a thin waist and giant breasts was a keeper because she was brilliant, funny, up for adventure, and probably better in bed that any woman I\u2019ve been with before or since.\n\nTL;dr - Age is a number. There are 40 year olds that have it and 20 year olds that don\u2019t. My sweet spot is 26-32 simply because you\u2019re more likely to get looks and personality.\n\n* 10s are not common in the real world. The most beautiful woman I\u2019ve ever vanilla dated was, at best, an 8.",

Men's looks peak about 8-10 years later than women, it's just the way of things.  I was at my peak hotness circa 30-33.  For women it's typically 20-24.\n\nHOWEVER, an arrangement is more than a lay.  Personality also plays a role and I will give a 35 year old who's cool and likes me a shot over a 22 year old who's boring and only in it for the cash.

In general I am fairly flexible on pictures and wait until the in-person meet to really judge looks.  My experience is that SBs are either better looking or worse looking than their pictures.  It's pretty weird how I very rarely come out of a m&g thinking \"she is exactly what I expected from the pictures.\"\n\nI can't explain exactly what it is that makes me message an SB profile... basically if they're my type I'll do it and if they're not I won't.  I'm pretty flexible on weight and looks if they're my type.  I'll message anyone from 18 up to my current age of 38.  I tend not to message women older than me though, and probably not that many from 35-37.  It feels a little too close to normal online dating.  But I still do occasionally.",

Of course it is up to the SD to choose what kind of bagage and drama he finds acceptable for his SR.\n\n*> All of this makes also it more difficult to sugar date older women.*\n\nThat depends, some SDs explicitly search for this life experience because for them that  brings positives to the SR.\n\n*> For a hypothetical 50 year old married man, dating a 41 year old sugar baby is more like cheating. But dating a 23 year old student is more like a sexual transgression like visiting a sex worker.*\n\nThis is the only thing in the usual anti 'older SB' arguments that makes some sense.\n\n*> It is also much more difficult to justify paying for dates, if age difference is smaller.*\n\nBS!  Allowances are paid to compensate for what the SD *cannot* offer his SB by what he *can*.\n\nThe allowance make us oversee flaws we wouldn't oversee in vanilla partners. These flaws may vary wildly: from age gap, availability, personality, level of attractiveness, to lack of future perspective and being married etc.",

They won't be on SA, or even be a freestyling SB, if they decide they want someone to take care of them they are the mistress to a billionaire.\n\n9's are famous runway models who make more money than the SDs that want to date them, you don't see them on SA either.\n\nOccasionally you see an 8, but they want 5x the normal allowance and are taken within a few weeks at most.\n\n6s and 7s drive the bowl, but most aren't willing to rate themselves as that because they think their most beautiful friend is a 10, when she's actually an 8 at best, and don't want to consider themselves 3-4 points lower than their friend.  Even as a 6 they are still more attractive than over half the population which should be enough for their self esteem.",

There is hot for 35 and then there is hot for 22 and a 22-6 will in most cases beats out a 35-8 et cetera.  Or to be more clear the 22 year old is an 8 and the 35 year old is a 6.  Men's looks peak about 8-10 years later than women, it's just the way of things.  I was at my peak hotness circa 30-33.  For women it's typically 20-24.\n\nHOWEVER, an arrangement is more than a lay.  Personality also plays a role and I will give a 35 year old who's cool and likes me a shot over a 22 year old who's boring and only in it for the cash.  Maybe I'm getting older myself but I've had some trouble lately finding things to talk about with the younger SBs.",
