    "body": "Long-time lurker here. \n\nI don\u2019t think I have enough courage to be an SB to be honest but let me tell you that you are all amazing. I enjoy reading your stories and successes.\n\nMy friends and I were discussing about a girl from college who suddenly became rich, got a surgery, traveled frequently and with a new flashy car. One of them pointed out that she must\u2019ve a sugar daddy and said things which I didn\u2019t like. I calmly told them that if ever she has a sugar daddy, if it is transactional and the relationship is consensual, I see nothing wrong with it. She wants the $$$ and he wants her youth and time. I think that shut their mouths.\n\nReading at your stories, I don\u2019t think I can date someone who\u2019s broke and unintelligent, ever again. Success and wealth are sexy. Being mentored is a major plus.  I can never sleep with a guy who can\u2019t even match at least the current lifestyle that I have because of all of you.\n\nThank you for helping me discover this.\n\nI wish you all the best!",

So I guess I lump women who know and do hair/makeup/skin who also tend to be very attractive and put together into the Cosmo girl label.  She hates it because she is not studying cosmetology and thinks cosmetology is for the birds.  I thought it was complementary because she would be a natural on the cover of Cosmopolitan magazine.\n\nSo I think our minds favor simple files we can slip people into.  We have to actually delve deeper/get educated to appreciate distinctions, including between sex workers and sugar babies.\n\nBTW I also think sex work is totally legit,  Doubtless many providers really enjoy it and do well, many do have great relationships with their clients, its for women to decide what to do with their bodies.

She hates it because she is not studying cosmetology and thinks cosmetology is for the birds.  I thought it was complementary because she would be a natural on the cover of Cosmopolitan magazine.\n\nSo I think our minds favor simple files we can slip people into.  We have to actually delve deeper/get educated to appreciate distinctions, including between sex workers and sugar babies.\n\nBTW I also think sex work is totally legit,  Doubtless many providers really enjoy it and do well, many do have great relationships with their clients, its for women to decide what to do with their bodies.

A few months later, I had a hernia that needed to be repaired and yet another surgery. In the past three months have gotten so far behind it isn't funny.

So I guess I lump women who know and do hair/makeup/skin who also tend to be very attractive and put together into the Cosmo girl label.  She hates it because she is not studying cosmetology and thinks cosmetology is for the birds.  I thought it was complementary because she would be a natural on the cover of Cosmopolitan magazine.\n\nSo I think our minds favor simple files we can slip people into.  We have to actually delve deeper/get educated to appreciate distinctions, including between sex workers and sugar babies.\n\nBTW I also think sex work is totally legit,  Doubtless many providers really enjoy it and do well, many do have great relationships with their clients, its for women to decide what to do with their bodies.  Legalize, regulate, protect.",
