I have been using clay for the non-shiny effect and does not look like you have any hair product on your hair giving the \"natural\" look. Most barbers in China use gel but the result feel a bit slimy(?) and look spiky. Is there a gel/clay that could fulfill all these requirements? Or a method to use gel for Asian hair? \n\nMost youtube tutorial videos use straightener and clay but spending almost an hour everyday on styling your head seems overboard if I'm just going to school/work for 5 hours and not to a party or somewhere where you have to dress up nicely. And almost all gel videos are just Japanese spiky hairstyles. ",
