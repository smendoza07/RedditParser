    "body": "Me and my SB have been together for almost a year.  We call each other bf and gf in public but still are clear that it\u2019s an arrangement.  I still provide my monthly support, which even for NYC standards is non trivial.  It provides a comfortable apartment in the city and pays for all of her living expenses.\n\nWe meet one night a week, while we have traditional feelings for each other I still provide the financial support as agreed at the beginning of our arrangement.  Two weeks ago we met and she wasn\u2019t feeling good because of her monthly visitor.  No problem that is to be expected, it happens.  We still meet and enjoy dinner out and occasional shopping in these situations.  Ending the evening with a drink and retire to bed.  No sex, which is fine given the circumstances.  \n\nLast week we met and she said she was feeling better but and over her monthly visitor.  I was excited because it was two weeks since we enjoyed each other\u2019s company intimately.  Long story short, no sex a second week in a row.  \n\nI made a few moves which she deflected.   I asked her if she was ok, to which she responded that she was stressed about a few family issues.  We have discussed them in the past and we spent the rest of the night talking about them.  I get that times were less than ideal, but with all due respect this is still an arrangement.  It\u2019s been half a month with no sex and all the financial commitments were met.  We have traditional look and feel, but the underlying tone is still there, we are clear about that.  I don\u2019t state financial concerns or burdens as to why I may not want to pay for the months commitments.  I meet my commitment, almost for 12 months now. \n\nSo SB\u2019s, don\u2019t fall into the trap of taking things for granted.  This type of arrangement started for a reason.  Please don\u2019t make your SD ask for intimacy if he is still meeting his commitments.  I imagine like in my case, your SD doesn\u2019t require you to ask for the financial support.",

The SB can miss a date here and there. The SD can occasionally ask to meet up more than agreed.\n\nThis is the healthiest attitude for an allowance based SR. Things should flow more naturally and less mercenary. But *always* in TWO directions! Otherwise better stick to PPM.",

This might be why she doesn't want intimacy and op is feeling something similar. Might be worth thinking about whether it's the lack of sex on a single date that is bothering op or something serious and that the relationship might be coming to an end. Sometimes we are looking for an excuse to end things without realising.",

Or even worse he never even says it just expects the gal to grin and bear it. I understand that score keeping is not the right way to do this but there is an unspoken rule on how SRs should work.

I will not call a lot of what we read on SLF as mainstream. SLF has a massive pro SB / sex worker skew where SDs are explicitly portrayed as old, lonely, fat douche bags who manipulate women. As for the allowance thread take it with a grain of salt. Most SDs in that thread are quoting a ppm and SBs are quoting a ppm 3x what SDs are.\n\nBtw what we hear is that ladies have lost the incentive to date douches in their own age group who cannot support themselves financially, are cheating and indulging in abusive behavior and are not good in bed.",

If you want to stay on PPM and have sex every time you meet then by all means get a regular escort. But sadly she won\u2019t pretend to like you, won\u2019t text you in between meets, won\u2019t listen to YOUR problems, won\u2019t get you sweet gifts on your birthday or Christmas and won\u2019t be seen in public with you, not to mention the unprotected sex you all want and exclusivity on our side yet 90 percent of SDs are married. What an Sb offers is so much more than being reduced to just sex, especially if you\u2019ve been intimate with your SB every single date for a year bar 2 dates. \nLook up the escorts rates in your area and realise that for a girl of the same calibre as your current Sb you\u2019d probably only get 1-2 hours for your ppm or a couple of overnight dates for your monthly allowance like for like even if the allowance you offer is in the 4 figures. That wouldn\u2019t get you much with a high end professional. \nMost SDs get a very good deal from their Sb that\u2019s why sugaring is so popular. \nMy SD has turned down sex with me a few times due to periods of high stress in his life, we still chilled and ate food or went for a walk he talked to me about his problems and left feeling a lot better and still paid the allowance, it seems that a lot of guys here put zero \u2018value\u2019 on all the additional little extras we do as SBs.",

If an SR is a genuine relationship it wouldn't be just because she's to giving him sex through no fault of her own. He would still wanna help her regardless.  If she's still giving you her emotions, her time, her thoughts etc that she would give you on a normal date but you dont want to gift her because she doesn't give sex then?  Thats how a relationship works you don't withhold things when you don't get what you want once or twice. What you're talking about is a transaction. Which I don't see anything wrong with it but dont get upset when people call it what it is.",

No SR is completely the same and you'll have wildly different experiences depending on what each SD / SB is looking for.  So to answer your question, no I do not believe that sex is absolutely required Every time they meet for me personally. but the SD is starting to feel that the relationship is no longer mutually beneficial. If either party starts to feel like the SR is no longer mutually beneficial they need to work it out or move on.",

Ones where the SD supports me because he\u2019s able to and because it helps me with my goals. Certainly, part of the reason they care for me as much as they do is that we have amazing sex. But that\u2019s not all there is. And if it\u2019s absent occasionally, that hasn\u2019t been an issue for us.\n\nThe reason I react so strongly to your post is that you claim to have traditional feelings for this woman yet don\u2019t extend a pretty basic level of consideration and trust to her. I understand that many SDs have been burned before, but you guys have been together a year! Doesn\u2019t that earn her some of your trust? And if it doesn\u2019t, it sounds like that\u2019s a broader problem with your SR than just her not wanting sex for two dates.\n\nAlso, not that we\u2019re voting, but quite a few SDs chimed in that 1) you should be understanding and, 2) if you aren\u2019t happy you should communicate.",

I keep trying to communicate and provide to ease her tensions but it does not work. On top of that she still can\u2019t see I have needs too. I feel ignored. I feel not seen. I have needs. Intimacy and romance - joy, excitement and happiness is important to me - it is MY love language. I NEED physical touch. I am not feeling fulfilled because my needs aren\u2019t meant and she was suppose to be that for me. Now I\u2019m disappointed and lost because it is not the same and I don\u2019t have a solution to make it better.\u201d*\n\n  Pretty sure it more than just denial of physical touch. I think it goes deeper. I have nothing but sympathy because I know how much rejection hurts. I am a physical touch kind of person and when rejected pain runs chest deep. Not exactly controllable. He needs to find his happiness elsewhere and back away from her for a bit. Once out of this cloud he will wonder why he kept trying as life will be easier.",

Especially after learning that this sub has the most overlap with an essentially incel / anti feminist one. Why wouldn\u2019t I feel animosity? (That\u2019s rhetorical. Again, what you think of me or my perceived problems is not actually my problem. And asking what happened to a sworker to scorn them so might seem cheeky and fun is pretty gross to me too)",

I would think you would have some kind of routine in place by this time - either that you schedule on a different day or you're ok with period sex.  Especially since you're only meeting once a week.  Seems like from what you said that historically you have the routine of meeting anyways and having a sexless sleepover.  So I can't blame her on this if this is the routine you've established.\n\nThe second week seems like the aberration.  My opinion - It seems this SR has expired based on the way you described the second interaction.  If you're in a sexless SR, then you only have yourself to blame at this point.  I don't think there is any way to recover and I think you're fooling yourself by thinking you two somehow evolved into something traditional.  She really doesn't care about you at all and maybe, like others have said, she has a boyfriend.\n\nIf the girl is into you in a traditional way, she will be waking you up for sex and meeting more than once a week.",

Communication has to be at least attempted, and is generally initiated by the partner that feels left out or slighted.  Addressing the issue, rather than the person, works so much better.",

SRs are *mutually* beneficial. And while it's not a straight cash-for-sex exchange, it doesn't take a lot of SLF reading to understand that platonic, sexless relationships don't cut it for SDs and don't form the basis of SRs. SBs pretty much know this. How would the SB react if SD told her that business was slow, so he wouldn't be able to give her any money for a while?  \n\n\n>Feels . . . as if the whole arrangement is just about paying for sex.\n\nArrangements aren't ONLY about paying for sex, but physical intimacy is definitely part of it",

Pull back big time! She is suppose to be your fun escape - not a burden. She can save her drama for her mama or therapist! A man (in any role, especially this one) does not have the proper advice and should never be a sounding board. Gently pull away and find someone mature enough who knows how to give and take appropriately. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this. Rejection and lack of intimacy sucks especially when you give so much. By the way - your happiness is important! Take care of yourself too!",

So I wouldn\u2019t worry unless she shoots you down a third time in a row.\n\nThat said, with once weekly dates, I wouldn\u2019t have recommended you to move her beyond a PPM arrangement. I personally start my SBs on a weekly allowance. It\u2019s up to them to show me whether they\u2019re going to do the bare minimum (once/wk) or if they\u2019ll treat it more like a relationship (at least once/wk with some chit chat/flirting throughout the week). If they\u2019re the bare minimum type, I leave it at a weekly allowance (which is basically PPM at that point). If they go above and beyond, I start to move towards biweekly/monthly allowance, mix in platonic dates, throw in shopping, etc. Sounds like you\u2019re dealing with a bare minimum SB but giving her the allowance treatment, which is causing you to continue to \u201ckeep count\u201d.",

Long story short we made a great coupon clipping team and she raised the bar in my household so that I became an excellent single father. I owe her more than I can say.\n\nThese days she lives with me, has a car and money to spend, but still keeps a job to maintain her independence. We dont have sex for a health reason on her end and she is fine with me sugar dating on the side. \n\nI do occasionally get the feeling that I am married again to another imperfect woman who finds it easier to put up with me than to strike out on her own. The resentment fades, and lets be honest, I date women half her age on the side so I am no saint. \n\nHowever..... Its not at all a sugar relationship. If your SB expects you to treat her as if it is a real relationship, but withholds sex....in the immortal words of my divorce attorney.... \"you can try to put it back together but once you stop having sex it's time to admit it's over and you need to protect yourself.\" Naturally I didnt believe him at the time and continued sinking further into debt trying to keep my family together. \n\nDont mistake financial laziness or dependency with love. My wife stuck around because she was funneling money to her online boyfriend so they would have a nest egg after the divorce was filed. When I realized that I gave my attorney the nuclear codes and thats why I have my house and custody of my son and business after the divorce. \n\nTreat your SB like a girlfriend or a wife if you like, just remember when the sex stops, the relationship is over no matter what kind of relationship it is.",

I will not call a lot of what we read on SLF as mainstream. SLF has a massive pro SB / sex worker skew where SDs are explicitly portrayed as old, lonely, fat douche bags who manipulate women. As for the allowance thread take it with a grain of salt. Most SDs in that thread are quoting a ppm and SBs are quoting a ppm 3x what SDs are.\n\nBtw what we hear is that ladies have lost the incentive to date douches in their own age group who cannot support themselves financially, are cheating and indulging in abusive behavior and are not good in bed.",

There are many shades of gray in the bowl, some sbs operate more like escorts transactionally and some more closer to regular dating like a spoiled gf type of situation. No SR is completely the same and you'll have wildly different experiences depending on what each SD / SB is looking for.  So to answer your question, no I do not believe that sex is absolutely required Every time they meet for me personally. but the SD is starting to feel that the relationship is no longer mutually beneficial. If either party starts to feel like the SR is no longer mutually beneficial they need to work it out or move on.",

Intimacy and romance - joy, excitement and happiness is important to me - it is MY love language. I NEED physical touch. I am not feeling fulfilled because my needs aren\u2019t meant and she was suppose to be that for me. Now I\u2019m disappointed and lost because it is not the same and I don\u2019t have a solution to make it better.\u201d*\n\n  Pretty sure it more than just denial of physical touch. I think it goes deeper. I have nothing but sympathy because I know how much rejection hurts. I am a physical touch kind of person and when rejected pain runs chest deep. Not exactly controllable. He needs to find his happiness elsewhere and back away from her for a bit. Once out of this cloud he will wonder why he kept trying as life will be easier.",

I know you are going through some stuff right now, and I have been right there for you and helping as best I can.  Since we hopefully based on clear and honest communication, what can we do together that helps me through this bumpy spot too?  I feel ( very important to include your feelings, they are as important as hers, she should get this) very guilty about having to ask for attention, but if I don't that guilt will turn to resentment and thats bad for us.  Imagine how you'd feel, if on the first, your rent money didn't come through, and all I could focus on was a business issue I was having.  You'd maybe be concerned for me, then worried for your situation, then resentful that I wasn't carrying my share, I have to guess.\"\n\nThis. Very well written.",

SRs are *mutually* beneficial. And while it's not a straight cash-for-sex exchange, it doesn't take a lot of SLF reading to understand that platonic, sexless relationships don't cut it for SDs and don't form the basis of SRs. SBs pretty much know this. How would the SB react if SD told her that business was slow, so he wouldn't be able to give her any money for a while?  \n\n\n>Feels . . . as if the whole arrangement is just about paying for sex.\n\nArrangements aren't ONLY about paying for sex, but physical intimacy is definitely part of it",

I would so much rather be in a relationship with a person who can healthily communicate their feelings and say when they're not up to sex, rather than someone who pushes through their own reservations and then ends up traumatizing themselves by having sex they don't want. I have been that dishonest partner who goes along to get along, and it hurts us both in the end. \n\nThere is simply no comparison between someone spending money which they clearly comfortably have, and someone pressuring themselves into performing sex acts when they're not in the right headspace. It just isn't even in the same ballpark. \n\nIt's the holiday season. Enjoy your position as someone who can give selflessly both emotionally and financially, for at least a little while.

I understand that many SDs have been burned before, but you guys have been together a year! Doesn\u2019t that earn her some of your trust? And if it doesn\u2019t, it sounds like that\u2019s a broader problem with your SR than just her not wanting sex for two dates.\n\nAlso, not that we\u2019re voting, but quite a few SDs chimed in that 1) you should be understanding and, 2) if you aren\u2019t happy you should communicate.",

SBs pretty much know this. How would the SB react if SD told her that business was slow, so he wouldn't be able to give her any money for a while?  \n\n\n>Feels . . . as if the whole arrangement is just about paying for sex.\n\nArrangements aren't ONLY about paying for sex, but physical intimacy is definitely part of it",

If an SR is a genuine relationship it wouldn't be just because she's to giving him sex through no fault of her own. He would still wanna help her regardless.  If she's still giving you her emotions, her time, her thoughts etc that she would give you on a normal date but you dont want to gift her because she doesn't give sex then?  Thats how a relationship works you don't withhold things when you don't get what you want once or twice. What you're talking about is a transaction. Which I don't see anything wrong with it but dont get upset when people call it what it is.",

There are many shades of gray in the bowl, some sbs operate more like escorts transactionally and some more closer to regular dating like a spoiled gf type of situation. No SR is completely the same and you'll have wildly different experiences depending on what each SD / SB is looking for.  So to answer your question, no I do not believe that sex is absolutely required Every time they meet for me personally. but the SD is starting to feel that the relationship is no longer mutually beneficial. If either party starts to feel like the SR is no longer mutually beneficial they need to work it out or move on.",

I will not call a lot of what we read on SLF as mainstream. SLF has a massive pro SB / sex worker skew where SDs are explicitly portrayed as old, lonely, fat douche bags who manipulate women. As for the allowance thread take it with a grain of salt. Most SDs in that thread are quoting a ppm and SBs are quoting a ppm 3x what SDs are.\n\nBtw what we hear is that ladies have lost the incentive to date douches in their own age group who cannot support themselves financially, are cheating and indulging in abusive behavior and are not good in bed.",

An SB can choose to operate like a sex worker / escort  if she wants. Some SRs resemble more like regular relationships while some can resemble more like transactional meets. It's really how 2 people connect and it's all individual no one size fits all here.",

So to answer your question, no I do not believe that sex is absolutely required Every time they meet for me personally. but the SD is starting to feel that the relationship is no longer mutually beneficial.

Most SDs in that thread are quoting a ppm and SBs are quoting a ppm 3x what SDs are.\n\nBtw what we hear is that ladies have lost the incentive to date douches in their own age group who cannot support themselves financially, are cheating and indulging in abusive behavior and are not good in bed.",

No SR is completely the same and you'll have wildly different experiences depending on what each SD / SB is looking for.  So to answer your question, no I do not believe that sex is absolutely required Every time they meet for me personally. but the SD is starting to feel that the relationship is no longer mutually beneficial. If either party starts to feel like the SR is no longer mutually beneficial they need to work it out or move on.",

So to answer your question, no I do not believe that sex is absolutely required Every time they meet for me personally. but the SD is starting to feel that the relationship is no longer mutually beneficial.
