            "body": "Idk how I feel about Gary, KJK, and JSJ. I'll admit I didn't watch too many episodes with Gary. Then the reason why I'm iffy about KJK there is bc his whole persona is the gangster despite him being a genuinely nice person. Like I would get the good bc he's nice and bc he doesn't take unnecessary risks but that whole thug persona is making this hard for me. And then there's JSJ, the narcissist \ud83d\ude02\u2764. Weak, gets \"bullied\" easily, is lost often, but is still a tiger moth who'd betray and yell at people. I feel like there are simply too many members that overlap. Also, I was initially alright with LJS and HH where they were but as I ttped this post I realized LKS is always chaotic and always evil (betrayal king). At least HH sometimes tells the truth and he's a lot smarter and sneakier about being evil. Plus, a lot of the time he just stays quiet and plays a more positive role like pushing the love lines, so the fact that he can be both a positive and negative force make me lean more towards neutral. Similar change happened with me regarding KJK and SJH only bc JH betrays others on occasion. It's extremely rare for JK to do the same. Plus, JH is so quiet as of late and doesn't get as much screen time, which would contribute to her simply being there. Kinda like a seen and not heard, which is very reminiscent of neutral, neutral.",
