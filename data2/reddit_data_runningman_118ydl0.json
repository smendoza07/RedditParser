I haven't seen him outside of running man on other shows much except the roommate thing he did with JSM, but from what I've seen so far I think him being kind of assertive, confident and firm in his stance and values is very manly. I don't know why this clip reminded me of that, though. \ud83d\ude01\n\nEdit: \nI wanna clarify something. When I say he might not be good looking, I'm only talking about the ridiculous Kbeauty standards and like what most people would consider attractive. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and I don't think he's unattractive at all. In fact, when he cleans up (does his hair or doesn't dress like a teenager or an old man) he looks very handsome. Just wanted to clarify this.",

But, that's actually one thing that I find very attractive too. He is so fatherly towards younger women, and I suspect that's the reason they feel so comfortable with him. Heck, Jessi even outright said that YJS reminded her of her dad. There's something so endearing about a man who really doesn't see these attractive young women around him as any other way than his younger sisters/daughters. He is the standard.",

But, that's actually one thing that I find very attractive too. He is so fatherly towards younger women, and I suspect that's the reason they feel so comfortable with him. Heck, Jessi even outright said that YJS reminded her of her dad. There's something so endearing about a man who really doesn't see these attractive young women around him as any other way than his younger sisters/daughters. He is the standard.",
