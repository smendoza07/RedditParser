    "body": "I\u2019ve noticed many girls telling me that more and more younger guys are trying to get into this lifestyle.\n\nI started when I was 24 so I think I can give you all some wonderful insight.\n\nFirst off, I had money generational wealth. If you don\u2019t have money I HIGHLY suggest you stay away from this lifestyle and work or you will quickly burn away cash that you probably need.\n\nI understand that many younger guys are coming onto this lifestyle because modern dating and dating apps is very much against you. You will NOT find love here. Most of these girls are looking for a fun time and to be paid, that is all. You are in a sense being used, do not think anything other than this. That being said you are also \u201cusing\u201d them. That is why often people start to feel that these types of relationship feel \u201ctransactional\u201d. If you are nodding your head to all of this then ok congratulations I think you\u2019re ready to jump in. 1. Just because you\u2019re young doesn\u2019t mean girls will lower their allowance expectations for you 2. Don\u2019t want to feel transactional? Get some actual chemistry going on then. Make her laugh. Make it feel normal, otherwise it\u2019s time to leave the bowl or find someone else 3. BE SAFE, it\u2019s very easy in this lifestyle to have multiple partners so stay safe.\n\nI have been robbed, forced into intimacy, blackmailed and scammed. These will happen to you. You can be the smartest man but one mistake led by your other head can land you exactly where I was too.\n\nI have also spent too much money than I probably shouldn\u2019t have.\nGuys, relationships/sex aren\u2019t traits that make a man. Don\u2019t set value of yourself based on that or you will regret it.\n\nThat being all said:\nI am officially going to retire. I noticed I have begun to see women in a darker light which stems from being involved in this lifestyle. Wishing no longer to behave this way I am taking my leave.\n\nEdit:\nPeople seem to think I\u2019ve only had bad experiences.\nI have had WONDERFUL experiences in this lifestyle and even turned sugar relationships into vanilla ones. This lifestyle can be very fun if you have the means and can handle the risks / emotions involved in it. It\u2019s not for everyone but for those that it appeals to, it\u2019s a nice time.",

And as you've found out, it gets extremely expensive, even coming in with old money like you, being in the bowl for 4 solid years has set you back a shitload. You should have spent that time getting experience in vanilla relationships , saving and investing as these are your prime earning years. I think a lot of young dudes just think, im not good with women so ill just get a sugar baby and ill be happy because shes having sex with me. Then they realize the woman doesnt really like them and is only seeing them for the money. Paying someone for companionship doesn't automatically make you a good boyfriend / lover.  It can really start to mess with your head and sometimes its better to just be single than directly  paying for companionship lol. I agree with pretty much everything else. The bowl is a black hole.",

The instincts you learn in iffy situations really help in the long run. \n\nI didn't bring up the diner waitress who was obsessed over by truckers and locals of the town, but that's just an easy example of a regular person who didn't see people in a 'darker light.' I think the darkness makes you grateful for the well-lit people in your life or that you come to meet. And more careful in dim situations",

No matter how nice someone is to you, having things in common/having mutual attraction - there's always possibility of risk. Sugaring is dangerous in so many tiers of development. I meant what I said when anyone can work/be involved in something and become wary of a group of people. A stripper, a SD, even a diner waitress. \n\nMistrust is good to learn early on. Knowing when to stop sugaring before becoming jaded is admirable.",

Free is a relative term. Some SBs will do that because, after all, they are women and they want to date a hot young dude. There is nothing surprising there.\n\nBut many of those SBs are likely looking for a husband because that is also what women do. They have fun until they find the 'right one'. If the guy is sufficiently wealthy and falling in love, they don't need to lower the price if they're smart.\n\nYou know what, men do the same thing - have fun dating until Mrs. Right comes along.\n\nWhen you marry a girl the price is actually much higher than dating or sugaring. Youth has nothing to do with it really when it comes to marriage, unless that is what you want to have. Several of my friends have met their young wives through the sugar bowl and had very happy marriages. They were happy because the women were young, beautiful, well-mannered, educated and brought up in good families while the men were old, professional, smart and very wealthy. The women knew they would in all likelihood outlast the men by decades and have tons of money by time they were left single widows in the 30-50 age range. So they made sure to treat the husbands like the personal gold mines they were. And that is exactly what happened in one case already; he died and left her wealthy and single. Their first date was a double date with me and another girl. She's now the Merry Widow.",

Everyone wants to have a good time. Clearly you didn\u2019t read this post and just brushed it off. \n\nAlso misogynistic!? I also didn\u2019t blame the women at all in this post \ud83d\ude02 seems to me like you\u2019re doing some projecting my guy",

I always say a woman can say whatever she wants but I only take woman seriously that date me with NO ALLOWANCE. If there is an allowance involved assume the girl does not give a shit and treat her as such meaning DO NOT DEVELOP FEELINGS FOR ANY OF THESE GIRLS YOU MEET ON SEEKING.\n\nAlso, I found seeking in my 40's after my divorce and I am glad that I did. That being said the quality of woman is going downhill fast and I tell my son all the time to not get married and work on making money. The majority of woman are simply not worth it. I have taken breaks from seeking and came back. That being said if I was in my 20's I would just concentrate on vanilla dating being you are the same girls age.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would also like to say that when you pay for a womans companionship they lose respect for you and they will respect the broke guy more than you. The girls on seeking are vanilla dating complete losers. I have many of their instagrams and the dudes they are dating and giving their time for free are a step above a convict. Also, I don't know if it is younger woman in general or girls from seeking but they all seem to take meds for some type of mental disorder wether it is depression or bipolar or some shit like that. Many of them are intelligent and would be great at sales. You have to be to be in this lifestyle, that being said I keep them at arms length.",

Free is a relative term. Some SBs will do that because, after all, they are women and they want to date a hot young dude. There is nothing surprising there.\n\nBut many of those SBs are likely looking for a husband because that is also what women do. They have fun until they find the 'right one'. If the guy is sufficiently wealthy and falling in love, they don't need to lower the price if they're smart.\n\nYou know what, men do the same thing - have fun dating until Mrs. Right comes along.\n\nWhen you marry a girl the price is actually much higher than dating or sugaring. Youth has nothing to do with it really when it comes to marriage, unless that is what you want to have. Several of my friends have met their young wives through the sugar bowl and had very happy marriages. They were happy because the women were young, beautiful, well-mannered, educated and brought up in good families while the men were old, professional, smart and very wealthy. The women knew they would in all likelihood outlast the men by decades and have tons of money by time they were left single widows in the 30-50 age range. So they made sure to treat the husbands like the personal gold mines they were. And that is exactly what happened in one case already; he died and left her wealthy and single. Their first date was a double date with me and another girl. She's now the Merry Widow.",

You start getting involved with people who wouldn't be with you if it weren't for the money at a young age and it will really warp your mind and perspective.

I meant what I said when anyone can work/be involved in something and become wary of a group of people. A stripper, a SD, even a diner waitress. \n\nMistrust is good to learn early on.

Free is a relative term. Some SBs will do that because, after all, they are women and they want to date a hot young dude. There is nothing surprising there.\n\nBut many of those SBs are likely looking for a husband because that is also what women do. They have fun until they find the 'right one'. If the guy is sufficiently wealthy and falling in love, they don't need to lower the price if they're smart.\n\nYou know what, men do the same thing - have fun dating until Mrs. Right comes along.\n\nWhen you marry a girl the price is actually much higher than dating or sugaring. Youth has nothing to do with it really when it comes to marriage, unless that is what you want to have. Several of my friends have met their young wives through the sugar bowl and had very happy marriages. They were happy because the women were young, beautiful, well-mannered, educated and brought up in good families while the men were old, professional, smart and very wealthy. The women knew they would in all likelihood outlast the men by decades and have tons of money by time they were left single widows in the 30-50 age range. So they made sure to treat the husbands like the personal gold mines they were. And that is exactly what happened in one case already; he died and left her wealthy and single. Their first date was a double date with me and another girl. She's now the Merry Widow.",

Some SBs will do that because, after all, they are women and they want to date a hot young dude. There is nothing surprising there.\n\nBut many of those SBs are likely looking for a husband because that is also what women do. They have fun until they find the 'right one'. If the guy is sufficiently wealthy and falling in love, they don't need to lower the price if they're smart.\n\nYou know what, men do the same thing - have fun dating until Mrs. Right comes along.\n\nWhen you marry a girl the price is actually much higher than dating or sugaring. Youth has nothing to do with it really when it comes to marriage, unless that is what you want to have. Several of my friends have met their young wives through the sugar bowl and had very happy marriages. They were happy because the women were young, beautiful, well-mannered, educated and brought up in good families while the men were old, professional, smart and very wealthy. The women knew they would in all likelihood outlast the men by decades and have tons of money by time they were left single widows in the 30-50 age range. So they made sure to treat the husbands like the personal gold mines they were. And that is exactly what happened in one case already; he died and left her wealthy and single. Their first date was a double date with me and another girl. She's now the Merry Widow.",
