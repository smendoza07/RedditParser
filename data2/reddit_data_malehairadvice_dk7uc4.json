However they are not wrong, if you want a nice hair cut, you do have to invest, barbershop, hair product and the effort. Especially those barbershop appointment maybe expensive and run you around 20 to 30 bucks and you may never find it satisfied after leaving the barbershop. I honestly wish i had good head shape to be able to pull the look. The money you save from the barbershop can get you 2 to 4 outfit with additional items that can last you at least 1 and half year. Ofc you do have to have some basic knowledge of being fashionable without breaking your bank.\n\nSummary: the money you saved from barbershop will be enough for you to do some affordable \"fashionable shopping\". It is kinda balance. I am one of those people who never get satisfield with new haircut, i shaved my head once, doesn't look right, so i am kinda jealous of you.",

It\u2019ll start of with a couple clothes. Model yourself after models/ musicians/ actors. Anyone who inspires you pretty much. Make your style personal but not over the top and it will be easy. I also recommend if you don\u2019t have the chance to go to the thrift to get blanks, like Hanes Gildan all that and using accessories like necklaces. I get all my accessories on eBay for 1-2$ and it adds like an extra bit to your style. Hope this helps :-)",

It\u2019s easier to maintain than shaving it close, you won\u2019t have to worry about it sticking out once it grows bc it would already be heavy enough to lay down. You\u2019re pretty round and keeping weight on the ridge/round of your head will create a square shape. It\u2019ll take time to get to that point but try it out! The taper makes it less \u201cboring\u201d  and becomes young and modern. You could fade it as well just keep it a low fade so you can build weight towards the top. . I just wouldn\u2019t go for a cut where the top is disconnected and the side is shaved up to the part like you had previously. Those are high maintenance anyways",
