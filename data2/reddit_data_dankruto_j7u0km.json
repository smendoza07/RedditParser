                                            "body": "Ok not necessarily, I mean no one is handling kyubi and hachibi together, but from what we have seen from most kage\u2019s (not all) they can handle any 2 of the lower tailed beasts together.\n\n\nHashirama: nothing needs to be said\n\nTobirama: Water style that rival\u2019s Kisame\u2019s, more intelligent than kisame, has more Jutsu\u2019s than him, better weaponry, etc. And we know Kisame can subdue tailed beasts handily and if he wanted to even kill them. Tobirama could probably do so better.\n\nMinato: This dude was dancing circles around the Kyubi, he can easily slap down any of the lower beasts, as long as he has nothing to sacrifice himself for they wouldn\u2019t even be able to hit him.\n\nSarutobi: idk actually, in his prime he could\u2019ve been exceptionally powerful but I think he could only handle 1 tailed beast, below the 7 tails as well.\n\nTsunade: once again idk, her healing is OP and her punches can crack a Susanoo, she has a fair chance of taking down a higher tailed beast, or maybe to lower ones. \n\n\nKakashi: We are not counting DMS (it\u2019s too broken, no tailed beast stands a chance since they can\u2019t counter Kamui or sharingan genjutsu), we see him and Guy fighting off 4 tailed beasts at the same time. They aren\u2019t winning but they are holding their own very well against the 3, 4, 5, 6 tails, even with the Bijuu doing combo moves, and basic maths means that either Kakashi or Guy could handle 2 lower tailed beasts (albeit with difficulty). \n\nNaruto: nothing needs to be said, he bitch-slapped half Kuruma\n\n3rd Raikage: this beast of a man seems like a tailed beast himself on the battlefield, fighting 10000 shinobi non-stop for 3 days, his skin is unnaturally tough and his power output is crazy. He could defeat 8 tails alone, and basic maths would mean he could handle 2 lower tailed beasts.\n\n4th Raikage (A): nearly the same stats as his dad, higher speed tho, can defeat 8 tails alone (not a perfect Junchuriki with 8 tails tho), basic maths means he can defeat 2 lower tailed beasts.\n\n3rd Tsuchikage: particle style that is akin to tailed beast bombs, I don\u2019t see how the Bijuu could counter this. Also can turn himself invisible to sensory, and this means his surprise attacks can do devastating damage. Also he is an escape artist so at the very least the tailed beasts wouldn\u2019t be able to finish him.\n\nOhnoki: Same as his predecessor, but with his mass changing techniques instead of invisibility. \nDidn\u2019t immediately die to a trolling Madara so that\u2019s in his favour.\n\n3rd Mizukage: literally a Jinchuriki.\n\n4th Mizukage: Multiple Kekkei Genkai, similar to tailed beast styles. I however do think she would lose due to having no way to counter Bijuu bombs.\n\n3rd Kazekage: Would lose. (Lost to Orochimaru, tailed beasts would have no problem).\n\nGaara: Literally (was?) a Jinchuriki. His sand techniques are on Par with Ichibi, may lose to 2 tailed beasts.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s pretty much it. Not all the Kage\u2019s but many of them have shown themselves capable enough to handle 2 lower tailed beasts or 1 higher, with a few Kage\u2019s shown to be able to handle even more (e.g: Hashirama, Naruto, Minato). \n\n\nI didn\u2019t make such a bold statement without some proof. Hope you enjoyed :)",

Tobirama could probably do so better.\n\nMinato: This dude was dancing circles around the Kyubi, he can easily slap down any of the lower beasts, as long as he has nothing to sacrifice himself for they wouldn\u2019t even be able to hit him.\n\nSarutobi: idk actually, in his prime he could\u2019ve been exceptionally powerful but I think he could only handle 1 tailed beast, below the 7 tails as well.\n\nTsunade: once again idk, her healing is OP and her punches can crack a Susanoo, she has a fair chance of taking down a higher tailed beast, or maybe to lower ones. \n\n\nKakashi: We are not counting DMS (it\u2019s too broken, no tailed beast stands a chance since they can\u2019t counter Kamui or sharingan genjutsu), we see him and Guy fighting off 4 tailed beasts at the same time. They aren\u2019t winning but they are holding their own very well against the 3, 4, 5, 6 tails, even with the Bijuu doing combo moves, and basic maths means that either Kakashi or Guy could handle 2 lower tailed beasts (albeit with difficulty). \n\nNaruto: nothing needs to be said, he bitch-slapped half Kuruma\n\n3rd Raikage: this beast of a man seems like a tailed beast himself on the battlefield, fighting 10000 shinobi non-stop for 3 days, his skin is unnaturally tough and his power output is crazy. He could defeat 8 tails alone, and basic maths would mean he could handle 2 lower tailed beasts.\n\n4th Raikage (A): nearly the same stats as his dad, higher speed tho, can defeat 8 tails alone (not a perfect Junchuriki with 8 tails tho), basic maths means he can defeat 2 lower tailed beasts.\n\n3rd Tsuchikage: particle style that is akin to tailed beast bombs, I don\u2019t see how the Bijuu could counter this. Also can turn himself invisible to sensory, and this means his surprise attacks can do devastating damage. Also he is an escape artist so at the very least the tailed beasts wouldn\u2019t be able to finish him.\n\nOhnoki: Same as his predecessor, but with his mass changing techniques instead of invisibility. \nDidn\u2019t immediately die to a trolling Madara so that\u2019s in his favour.\n\n3rd Mizukage: literally a Jinchuriki.\n\n4th Mizukage: Multiple Kekkei Genkai, similar to tailed beast styles. I however do think she would lose due to having no way to counter Bijuu bombs.\n\n3rd Kazekage: Would lose. (Lost to Orochimaru, tailed beasts would have no problem).\n\nGaara: Literally (was?) a Jinchuriki. His sand techniques are on Par with Ichibi, may lose to 2 tailed beasts.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s pretty much it. Not all the Kage\u2019s but many of them have shown themselves capable enough to handle 2 lower tailed beasts or 1 higher, with a few Kage\u2019s shown to be able to handle even more (e.g: Hashirama, Naruto, Minato). \n\n\nI didn\u2019t make such a bold statement without some proof. Hope you enjoyed :)",

                            "body": "Ok not necessarily, I mean no one is handling kyubi and hachibi together, but from what we have seen from most kage\u2019s (not all) they can handle any 2 of the lower tailed beasts together.\n\n\nHashirama: nothing needs to be said\n\nTobirama: Water style that rival\u2019s Kisame\u2019s, more intelligent than kisame, has more Jutsu\u2019s than him, better weaponry, etc. And we know Kisame can subdue tailed beasts handily and if he wanted to even kill them. Tobirama could probably do so better.\n\nMinato: This dude was dancing circles around the Kyubi, he can easily slap down any of the lower beasts, as long as he has nothing to sacrifice himself for they wouldn\u2019t even be able to hit him.\n\nSarutobi: idk actually, in his prime he could\u2019ve been exceptionally powerful but I think he could only handle 1 tailed beast, below the 7 tails as well.\n\nTsunade: once again idk, her healing is OP and her punches can crack a Susanoo, she has a fair chance of taking down a higher tailed beast, or maybe to lower ones. \n\n\nKakashi: We are not counting DMS (it\u2019s too broken, no tailed beast stands a chance since they can\u2019t counter Kamui or sharingan genjutsu), we see him and Guy fighting off 4 tailed beasts at the same time. They aren\u2019t winning but they are holding their own very well against the 3, 4, 5, 6 tails, even with the Bijuu doing combo moves, and basic maths means that either Kakashi or Guy could handle 2 lower tailed beasts (albeit with difficulty). \n\nNaruto: nothing needs to be said, he bitch-slapped half Kuruma\n\n3rd Raikage: this beast of a man seems like a tailed beast himself on the battlefield, fighting 10000 shinobi non-stop for 3 days, his skin is unnaturally tough and his power output is crazy. He could defeat 8 tails alone, and basic maths would mean he could handle 2 lower tailed beasts.\n\n4th Raikage (A): nearly the same stats as his dad, higher speed tho, can defeat 8 tails alone (not a perfect Junchuriki with 8 tails tho), basic maths means he can defeat 2 lower tailed beasts.\n\n3rd Tsuchikage: particle style that is akin to tailed beast bombs, I don\u2019t see how the Bijuu could counter this. Also can turn himself invisible to sensory, and this means his surprise attacks can do devastating damage. Also he is an escape artist so at the very least the tailed beasts wouldn\u2019t be able to finish him.\n\nOhnoki: Same as his predecessor, but with his mass changing techniques instead of invisibility. \nDidn\u2019t immediately die to a trolling Madara so that\u2019s in his favour.\n\n3rd Mizukage: literally a Jinchuriki.\n\n4th Mizukage: Multiple Kekkei Genkai, similar to tailed beast styles. I however do think she would lose due to having no way to counter Bijuu bombs.\n\n3rd Kazekage: Would lose. (Lost to Orochimaru, tailed beasts would have no problem).\n\nGaara: Literally (was?) a Jinchuriki. His sand techniques are on Par with Ichibi, may lose to 2 tailed beasts.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s pretty much it. Not all the Kage\u2019s but many of them have shown themselves capable enough to handle 2 lower tailed beasts or 1 higher, with a few Kage\u2019s shown to be able to handle even more (e.g: Hashirama, Naruto, Minato). \n\n\nI didn\u2019t make such a bold statement without some proof. Hope you enjoyed :)",

                    "body": "Ok not necessarily, I mean no one is handling kyubi and hachibi together, but from what we have seen from most kage\u2019s (not all) they can handle any 2 of the lower tailed beasts together.\n\n\nHashirama: nothing needs to be said\n\nTobirama: Water style that rival\u2019s Kisame\u2019s, more intelligent than kisame, has more Jutsu\u2019s than him, better weaponry, etc. And we know Kisame can subdue tailed beasts handily and if he wanted to even kill them. Tobirama could probably do so better.\n\nMinato: This dude was dancing circles around the Kyubi, he can easily slap down any of the lower beasts, as long as he has nothing to sacrifice himself for they wouldn\u2019t even be able to hit him.\n\nSarutobi: idk actually, in his prime he could\u2019ve been exceptionally powerful but I think he could only handle 1 tailed beast, below the 7 tails as well.\n\nTsunade: once again idk, her healing is OP and her punches can crack a Susanoo, she has a fair chance of taking down a higher tailed beast, or maybe to lower ones. \n\n\nKakashi: We are not counting DMS (it\u2019s too broken, no tailed beast stands a chance since they can\u2019t counter Kamui or sharingan genjutsu), we see him and Guy fighting off 4 tailed beasts at the same time. They aren\u2019t winning but they are holding their own very well against the 3, 4, 5, 6 tails, even with the Bijuu doing combo moves, and basic maths means that either Kakashi or Guy could handle 2 lower tailed beasts (albeit with difficulty). \n\nNaruto: nothing needs to be said, he bitch-slapped half Kuruma\n\n3rd Raikage: this beast of a man seems like a tailed beast himself on the battlefield, fighting 10000 shinobi non-stop for 3 days, his skin is unnaturally tough and his power output is crazy. He could defeat 8 tails alone, and basic maths would mean he could handle 2 lower tailed beasts.\n\n4th Raikage (A): nearly the same stats as his dad, higher speed tho, can defeat 8 tails alone (not a perfect Junchuriki with 8 tails tho), basic maths means he can defeat 2 lower tailed beasts.\n\n3rd Tsuchikage: particle style that is akin to tailed beast bombs, I don\u2019t see how the Bijuu could counter this. Also can turn himself invisible to sensory, and this means his surprise attacks can do devastating damage. Also he is an escape artist so at the very least the tailed beasts wouldn\u2019t be able to finish him.\n\nOhnoki: Same as his predecessor, but with his mass changing techniques instead of invisibility. \nDidn\u2019t immediately die to a trolling Madara so that\u2019s in his favour.\n\n3rd Mizukage: literally a Jinchuriki.\n\n4th Mizukage: Multiple Kekkei Genkai, similar to tailed beast styles. I however do think she would lose due to having no way to counter Bijuu bombs.\n\n3rd Kazekage: Would lose. (Lost to Orochimaru, tailed beasts would have no problem).\n\nGaara: Literally (was?) a Jinchuriki. His sand techniques are on Par with Ichibi, may lose to 2 tailed beasts.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s pretty much it. Not all the Kage\u2019s but many of them have shown themselves capable enough to handle 2 lower tailed beasts or 1 higher, with a few Kage\u2019s shown to be able to handle even more (e.g: Hashirama, Naruto, Minato). \n\n\nI didn\u2019t make such a bold statement without some proof. Hope you enjoyed :)",

            "body": "Ok not necessarily, I mean no one is handling kyubi and hachibi together, but from what we have seen from most kage\u2019s (not all) they can handle any 2 of the lower tailed beasts together.\n\n\nHashirama: nothing needs to be said\n\nTobirama: Water style that rival\u2019s Kisame\u2019s, more intelligent than kisame, has more Jutsu\u2019s than him, better weaponry, etc. And we know Kisame can subdue tailed beasts handily and if he wanted to even kill them. Tobirama could probably do so better.\n\nMinato: This dude was dancing circles around the Kyubi, he can easily slap down any of the lower beasts, as long as he has nothing to sacrifice himself for they wouldn\u2019t even be able to hit him.\n\nSarutobi: idk actually, in his prime he could\u2019ve been exceptionally powerful but I think he could only handle 1 tailed beast, below the 7 tails as well.\n\nTsunade: once again idk, her healing is OP and her punches can crack a Susanoo, she has a fair chance of taking down a higher tailed beast, or maybe to lower ones. \n\n\nKakashi: We are not counting DMS (it\u2019s too broken, no tailed beast stands a chance since they can\u2019t counter Kamui or sharingan genjutsu), we see him and Guy fighting off 4 tailed beasts at the same time. They aren\u2019t winning but they are holding their own very well against the 3, 4, 5, 6 tails, even with the Bijuu doing combo moves, and basic maths means that either Kakashi or Guy could handle 2 lower tailed beasts (albeit with difficulty). \n\nNaruto: nothing needs to be said, he bitch-slapped half Kuruma\n\n3rd Raikage: this beast of a man seems like a tailed beast himself on the battlefield, fighting 10000 shinobi non-stop for 3 days, his skin is unnaturally tough and his power output is crazy. He could defeat 8 tails alone, and basic maths would mean he could handle 2 lower tailed beasts.\n\n4th Raikage (A): nearly the same stats as his dad, higher speed tho, can defeat 8 tails alone (not a perfect Junchuriki with 8 tails tho), basic maths means he can defeat 2 lower tailed beasts.\n\n3rd Tsuchikage: particle style that is akin to tailed beast bombs, I don\u2019t see how the Bijuu could counter this. Also can turn himself invisible to sensory, and this means his surprise attacks can do devastating damage. Also he is an escape artist so at the very least the tailed beasts wouldn\u2019t be able to finish him.\n\nOhnoki: Same as his predecessor, but with his mass changing techniques instead of invisibility. \nDidn\u2019t immediately die to a trolling Madara so that\u2019s in his favour.\n\n3rd Mizukage: literally a Jinchuriki.\n\n4th Mizukage: Multiple Kekkei Genkai, similar to tailed beast styles. I however do think she would lose due to having no way to counter Bijuu bombs.\n\n3rd Kazekage: Would lose. (Lost to Orochimaru, tailed beasts would have no problem).\n\nGaara: Literally (was?) a Jinchuriki. His sand techniques are on Par with Ichibi, may lose to 2 tailed beasts.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s pretty much it. Not all the Kage\u2019s but many of them have shown themselves capable enough to handle 2 lower tailed beasts or 1 higher, with a few Kage\u2019s shown to be able to handle even more (e.g: Hashirama, Naruto, Minato). \n\n\nI didn\u2019t make such a bold statement without some proof. Hope you enjoyed :)",
