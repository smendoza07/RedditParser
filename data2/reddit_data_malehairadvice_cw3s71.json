What I did to try and combat this was alternating between using a volumizing shampoo/conditioner (specifically volumizing because volumizing products are usually light and help get rid of extra oil that can weigh your hair down) and just rinsing with water. Id wash my hair with the shampoo and conditioner (always condition after using shampoo)  at the beginning of the week then the next day Id only use water to rinse out any grime and oil, be sure to really rinse it out not just get it wet because that can cause it to become oily, then the next day use the shampoo and conditioner again, and repeat. After about a week or two of doing this you should feel a difference in your hair.",

Its a little pricey being $30 on amazon for both of them, but theyre super good for your hair, they're completely sulfate and paraben free, theyll last you a long time (like a month or two) if you alternate washes like i suggested, and theyre specifically made with thick, heavy, oily hair in mind. But honestly if you want good products but are on a budget look in the \"Womens\" section of your local stores haircare products. For some reason a lot of people think men should smell a certain way and that they all need the same kind of rough shampoo, which is crazy, at least the womens section will actually give you options.",

What I did to try and combat this was alternating between using a volumizing shampoo/conditioner (specifically volumizing because volumizing products are usually light and help get rid of extra oil that can weigh your hair down) and just rinsing with water. Id wash my hair with the shampoo and conditioner (always condition after using shampoo)  at the beginning of the week then the next day Id only use water to rinse out any grime and oil, be sure to really rinse it out not just get it wet because that can cause it to become oily, then the next day use the shampoo and conditioner again, and repeat. After about a week or two of doing this you should feel a difference in your hair.",

Its a little pricey being $30 on amazon for both of them, but theyre super good for your hair, they're completely sulfate and paraben free, theyll last you a long time (like a month or two) if you alternate washes like i suggested, and theyre specifically made with thick, heavy, oily hair in mind. But honestly if you want good products but are on a budget look in the \"Womens\" section of your local stores haircare products. For some reason a lot of people think men should smell a certain way and that they all need the same kind of rough shampoo, which is crazy, at least the womens section will actually give you options.",

What I did to try and combat this was alternating between using a volumizing shampoo/conditioner (specifically volumizing because volumizing products are usually light and help get rid of extra oil that can weigh your hair down) and just rinsing with water. Id wash my hair with the shampoo and conditioner (always condition after using shampoo)  at the beginning of the week then the next day Id only use water to rinse out any grime and oil, be sure to really rinse it out not just get it wet because that can cause it to become oily, then the next day use the shampoo and conditioner again, and repeat. After about a week or two of doing this you should feel a difference in your hair.",

Its a little pricey being $30 on amazon for both of them, but theyre super good for your hair, they're completely sulfate and paraben free, theyll last you a long time (like a month or two) if you alternate washes like i suggested, and theyre specifically made with thick, heavy, oily hair in mind. But honestly if you want good products but are on a budget look in the \"Womens\" section of your local stores haircare products. For some reason a lot of people think men should smell a certain way and that they all need the same kind of rough shampoo, which is crazy, at least the womens section will actually give you options.",

Id wash my hair with the shampoo and conditioner (always condition after using shampoo)  at the beginning of the week then the next day Id only use water to rinse out any grime and oil, be sure to really rinse it out not just get it wet because that can cause it to become oily, then the next day use the shampoo and conditioner again, and repeat.

Its a little pricey being $30 on amazon for both of them, but theyre super good for your hair, they're completely sulfate and paraben free, theyll last you a long time (like a month or two) if you alternate washes like i suggested, and theyre specifically made with thick, heavy, oily hair in mind. But honestly if you want good products but are on a budget look in the \"Womens\" section of your local stores haircare products. For some reason a lot of people think men should smell a certain way and that they all need the same kind of rough shampoo, which is crazy, at least the womens section will actually give you options.",
