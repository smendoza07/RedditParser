For instance, was this a first in person meet? Or your anniversary with your SB? Because I treat SB\u2019s really well, and I hear all the stories but this is NOT typical, but you lost it like it\u2019s a guideline of what SB\u2019s should be looking for.

I agree with you, not a sugar relationship.\n\nYour response is that you want to build a relationship, and have a monthly allowance.  I agree with you, that's a sugar relationship.    But, if you are implying a sugar relationship can't be built on PPM, that's not true.  You can build a perfectly wonderful SR on PPM -- but it has to be an SR, not just \"meet for sex\".  It's not the details of the logistics of financial support that makes it a sugar relationship, it's that there is a relationship and there is financial support.",

The conversation also suffers from two people who are overly-terse in the way they communicate, but if he meant more than \"sex and PPM\", he needed to say it (OP is overly-terse also, and the exchange is an example of what happens when both people are overly terse).\n\nOn SDs talking about sex, you have a point -- why shouldn't we be able to say intimacy is expected.   I don't think it should be very different from financial support -- should message a bit before bringing this up, or you can give the wrong impression.  Still, I rarely bring up sex explicitly until later, and that's because I've found there's almost never a need to.  I've never had to explain this, and never been surprised by an SB who assumed we were going to be platonic",

If the woman is interested in intimacy primarily (she has a high libido,  she loves experimentation, she has limited time due to familial or work obligations), as arrangement based on intimacy and post coitus relaxation may be exactly what she is looking for. \n\nMy point is this:pragmatically, this lifestyle is already marginalized. When we disparage that guy, we stratify this even more. That is judgment, and it would be folly for anyone of us to start casting stones.\n\nShe should NEVER do anything she is not comfortable with and men should never feel ashamed for saying that they want intimacy alone, even though that is too transactional for me.",

We can sit around and argue what is or isn't a loaf of bread, but even if it's fuzzy, \"loaf of bread\" has some limits -- a game of golf, for example, is not a loaf of bread.  If we can't agree on that, it's hard to see how we can communicate at all.\n\nCome to my room, bang, get PPM, is not an SR.  There are many other things that could be an SR that we might quibble about.  I suppose, for example, that one might have an SR where they're also a paypig, to use your example.  Hell, an SR that's all in a hotel room, but the first hour or two is bonding over lunch of a move, is arguably an SR -- at least there's a relationship being built beyond the sexual encounter.  But room/bang/PPM is just a paid-for sexual encounter, no matter how big tent we all want to be.  IMO of course!",

Guys are generally willing to pay significant amounts of money for intimacy, but not for a dinner and activity companion.  If you cannot get past the concept of someone paying you for 'meeting up to get naughty', I don't know that SR's will out work for you.

If you get to sit down and say hi before deciding whether to get intimate, it\u2019s much more like a SR, hookup, or whatever. \n\nYou will not get to long term without doing the  short term. You may have to do dozens of short terms before you find someone suitable for long term. \n\nYou can also check your girl game. Finding a man to sleep with you once is easy. Keeping him around in any capacity, takes skill. The more rich, powerful or attractive he is, the more game you need to have. \n\nAll of my long term SRs started as no strings attached hotel meets, some with coffee meet and greet first. None were too different from prostitution until the 2nd or 3rd dates, which lead to dinners, shopping and vacation.

Then it can evolve into activities together as friends, as opposed to formal dating.\n\nIt's a trade-off, I always tell SBs it's the same amount of support if we spend all day together doing activities, but it's more of your time. \n\nPlus, I get really confused when they want to do activities and they have a boyfriend at home, my brain can't process it. I tried it, but it feels like dating and it leads to the 'what are we' discussion. It's really embarrassing.\n\nGoing in public is a fun exoerience though, you stress out about meeting people you know, it's quite a thrill :)",

Many guys here try to thread the needle by capitulating to the definitions used by women to keep peace.\n\nI don't like transactions. That said, intimacy is what I want. \n\nI do not want to just have dinner, talk, take a trip, get advice,  etc without intimacy if I have an arrangement. Any man who tells you that he just wants to talk means that there would not be any need for pictures on any site. Why bother? All he wants is conversation,  right? \n\nThis is the problem. This forum and other forums will pile on men of he doesn't pay,  pays less than agreed upon,  etc. And if the man does not uphold his end, he should be criticized. \n\nBut if a man DARES to say, \"I want intimacy\", the ad hominem attacks start. He's a this,  he's a that. \n\nTHAT is why many guys don't want to speak up. They will be labeled in this forum and others.\n\nOne of ironies is that people are quick to label men if they ask for intimacy, but they do not \u013aabel the recipient of the allowance.

Any man saying this is being dishonest. This is easy to prove-if that is all he is looking for, then any relatively unattractive woman can be a SB.\n\nHe is looking for intimacy. It can be intimacy in addition to the above, but intimacy is paramount. \n\nIt makes no sense for any woman to lay out what they want from the relationship in terms of allowance, gifts, trips etc and the man having to suppress what he wants, which is intimacy. \n\nThere is a tenor in this forum that seems to lean towards men letting SBs know that intimacy is expected is verboten. This is problematic.\n\nI personally do not like transactional relationships and I love gift giving so that I can see her reaction. Louis Vuitton purses times two, Ferragamo purse times one, Louboutin shoes times two, Gucci purses times one, Apple headphones (the expensive ones) trips to LA, Half Moon Bay, etc. And the cash was gifted as well. \n\nBut it was earned. She made sure I was happy as well and what I wanted was intimacy.\n\nThe man in the OP's post is exactly right to ask for intimacy. Otherwise, what is he paying for?\n\nOnce he has satisfied his end of the agreement, the woman needs to uphold hers.\n\nThis forum really tries to absolve the woman of that responsibility, making it seem like the man is somehow sullying the purity of giving a woman a financial incentive to skip the pro forma and getting what he wants.\n\nIn edit-sorry if this is a double post.",

His message seems pretty simple: his idea of an SR is to have sex and give PPM.  That's just not an SR, IMO.  Without any of the relationship features, it's not a sugar relationship.  The conversation also suffers from two people who are overly-terse in the way they communicate, but if he meant more than \"sex and PPM\", he needed to say it (OP is overly-terse also, and the exchange is an example of what happens when both people are overly terse).\n\nOn SDs talking about sex, you have a point -- why shouldn't we be able to say intimacy is expected.   I don't think it should be very different from financial support -- should message a bit before bringing this up, or you can give the wrong impression.  Still, I rarely bring up sex explicitly until later, and that's because I've found there's almost never a need to.  I've never had to explain this, and never been surprised by an SB who assumed we were going to be platonic",

If the woman is interested in intimacy primarily (she has a high libido,  she loves experimentation, she has limited time due to familial or work obligations), as arrangement based on intimacy and post coitus relaxation may be exactly what she is looking for. \n\nMy point is this:pragmatically, this lifestyle is already marginalized. When we disparage that guy, we stratify this even more. That is judgment, and it would be folly for anyone of us to start casting stones.\n\nShe should NEVER do anything she is not comfortable with and men should never feel ashamed for saying that they want intimacy alone, even though that is too transactional for me.",

We can sit around and argue what is or isn't a loaf of bread, but even if it's fuzzy, \"loaf of bread\" has some limits -- a game of golf, for example, is not a loaf of bread.  If we can't agree on that, it's hard to see how we can communicate at all.\n\nCome to my room, bang, get PPM, is not an SR.  There are many other things that could be an SR that we might quibble about.  I suppose, for example, that one might have an SR where they're also a paypig, to use your example.  Hell, an SR that's all in a hotel room, but the first hour or two is bonding over lunch of a move, is arguably an SR -- at least there's a relationship being built beyond the sexual encounter.  But room/bang/PPM is just a paid-for sexual encounter, no matter how big tent we all want to be.  IMO of course!",

Any man saying this is being dishonest. This is easy to prove-if that is all he is looking for, then any relatively unattractive woman can be a SB.\n\nHe is looking for intimacy. It can be intimacy in addition to the above, but intimacy is paramount. \n\nIt makes no sense for any woman to lay out what they want from the relationship in terms of allowance, gifts, trips etc and the man having to suppress what he wants, which is intimacy. \n\nThere is a tenor in this forum that seems to lean towards men letting SBs know that intimacy is expected is verboten. This is problematic.\n\nI personally do not like transactional relationships and I love gift giving so that I can see her reaction. Louis Vuitton purses times two, Ferragamo purse times one, Louboutin shoes times two, Gucci purses times one, Apple headphones (the expensive ones) trips to LA, Half Moon Bay, etc. And the cash was gifted as well. \n\nBut it was earned. She made sure I was happy as well and what I wanted was intimacy.\n\nThe man in the OP's post is exactly right to ask for intimacy. Otherwise, what is he paying for?\n\nOnce he has satisfied his end of the agreement, the woman needs to uphold hers.\n\nThis forum really tries to absolve the woman of that responsibility, making it seem like the man is somehow sullying the purity of giving a woman a financial incentive to skip the pro forma and getting what he wants.",

And if you say it is then you\u2019re basically saying that arrangements are just a man wanting to pay for sex and would in turn make you a hypocrite because many SD\u2019s claim that\u2019s not what SR are, so who\u2019s lying..?

Many guys here try to thread the needle by capitulating to the definitions used by women to keep peace.\n\nI don't like transactions. That said, intimacy is what I want. \n\nI do not want to just have dinner, talk, take a trip, get advice,  etc without intimacy if I have an arrangement. Any man who tells you that he just wants to talk means that there would not be any need for pictures on any site. Why bother? All he wants is conversation,  right? \n\nThis is the problem. This forum and other forums will pile on men of he doesn't pay,  pays less than agreed upon,  etc. And if the man does not uphold his end, he should be criticized. \n\nBut if a man DARES to say, \"I want intimacy\", the ad hominem attacks start. He's a this,  he's a that. \n\nTHAT is why many guys don't want to speak up. They will be labeled in this forum and others.\n\nOne of ironies is that people are quick to label men if they ask for intimacy, but they do not \u013aabel the recipient of the allowance. That is just a head scratcher to me.",

It\u2019s not about spending money, lord knows I\u2019ve shelled out, but just the whole post of the itinerary and how much thought went into the formatting, it\u2019s not doing anyone any favors and says a bit about you imo. However, I don\u2019t hate you, though based on the things you said below I have some hunches about you; but the primary feeling I feel with respect to everything posted (and I\u2019m truly sorry to offend as it\u2019s not for the purpose of attack but honesty,) is a touch of pity. At the end of the day, I have no hate or animosity towards you, but I don\u2019t appreciate braggarts, ESPECIALLY when we\u2019re supposed to set an example. And no, I feel no jealousy or envy, I could brag too, but you\u2019d see how tasteless it comes off as. Just one man\u2019s opinion..",

His message seems pretty simple: his idea of an SR is to have sex and give PPM.  That's just not an SR, IMO.  Without any of the relationship features, it's not a sugar relationship.  The conversation also suffers from two people who are overly-terse in the way they communicate, but if he meant more than \"sex and PPM\", he needed to say it (OP is overly-terse also, and the exchange is an example of what happens when both people are overly terse).\n\nOn SDs talking about sex, you have a point -- why shouldn't we be able to say intimacy is expected.   I don't think it should be very different from financial support -- should message a bit before bringing this up, or you can give the wrong impression.  Still, I rarely bring up sex explicitly until later, and that's because I've found there's almost never a need to.  I've never had to explain this, and never been surprised by an SB who assumed we were going to be platonic",

If the woman is interested in intimacy primarily (she has a high libido,  she loves experimentation, she has limited time due to familial or work obligations), as arrangement based on intimacy and post coitus relaxation may be exactly what she is looking for. \n\nMy point is this:pragmatically, this lifestyle is already marginalized. When we disparage that guy, we stratify this even more. That is judgment, and it would be folly for anyone of us to start casting stones.\n\nShe should NEVER do anything she is not comfortable with and men should never feel ashamed for saying that they want intimacy alone, even though that is too transactional for me.",

We can sit around and argue what is or isn't a loaf of bread, but even if it's fuzzy, \"loaf of bread\" has some limits -- a game of golf, for example, is not a loaf of bread.  If we can't agree on that, it's hard to see how we can communicate at all.\n\nCome to my room, bang, get PPM, is not an SR.  There are many other things that could be an SR that we might quibble about.  I suppose, for example, that one might have an SR where they're also a paypig, to use your example.  Hell, an SR that's all in a hotel room, but the first hour or two is bonding over lunch of a move, is arguably an SR -- at least there's a relationship being built beyond the sexual encounter.  But room/bang/PPM is just a paid-for sexual encounter, no matter how big tent we all want to be.  IMO of course!",

Many guys here try to thread the needle by capitulating to the definitions used by women to keep peace.\n\nI don't like transactions. That said, intimacy is what I want. \n\nI do not want to just have dinner, talk, take a trip, get advice,  etc without intimacy if I have an arrangement. Any man who tells you that he just wants to talk means that there would not be any need for pictures on any site. Why bother? All he wants is conversation,  right? \n\nThis is the problem. This forum and other forums will pile on men of he doesn't pay,  pays less than agreed upon,  etc. And if the man does not uphold his end, he should be criticized. \n\nBut if a man DARES to say, \"I want intimacy\", the ad hominem attacks start. He's a this,  he's a that. \n\nTHAT is why many guys don't want to speak up. They will be labeled in this forum and others.\n\nOne of ironies is that people are quick to label men if they ask for intimacy, but they do not \u013aabel the recipient of the allowance.

If the woman is interested in intimacy primarily (she has a high libido,  she loves experimentation, she has limited time due to familial or work obligations), as arrangement based on intimacy and post coitus relaxation may be exactly what she is looking for. \n\nMy point is this:pragmatically, this lifestyle is already marginalized. When we disparage that guy, we stratify this even more. That is judgment, and it would be folly for anyone of us to start casting stones.\n\nShe should NEVER do anything she is not comfortable with and men should never feel ashamed for saying that they want intimacy alone, even though that is too transactional for me.",

We can sit around and argue what is or isn't a loaf of bread, but even if it's fuzzy, \"loaf of bread\" has some limits -- a game of golf, for example, is not a loaf of bread.  If we can't agree on that, it's hard to see how we can communicate at all.\n\nCome to my room, bang, get PPM, is not an SR.  There are many other things that could be an SR that we might quibble about.  I suppose, for example, that one might have an SR where they're also a paypig, to use your example.  Hell, an SR that's all in a hotel room, but the first hour or two is bonding over lunch of a move, is arguably an SR -- at least there's a relationship being built beyond the sexual encounter.  But room/bang/PPM is just a paid-for sexual encounter, no matter how big tent we all want to be.  IMO of course!",

If it was only sex and money, she was a prostitute.  If you had a relationship, even limited to indoors, that\u2019s still an SR.

There are many other things that could be an SR that we might quibble about.  I suppose, for example, that one might have an SR where they're also a paypig, to use your example.  Hell, an SR that's all in a hotel room, but the first hour or two is bonding over lunch of a move, is arguably an SR -- at least there's a relationship being built beyond the sexual encounter.

At the end of the day, I have no hate or animosity towards you, but I don\u2019t appreciate braggarts, ESPECIALLY when we\u2019re supposed to set an example. And no, I feel no jealousy or envy, I could brag too, but you\u2019d see how tasteless it comes off as. Just one man\u2019s opinion..",

If it was only sex and money, she was a prostitute.  If you had a relationship, even limited to indoors, that\u2019s still an SR.

That is literally the definition.   If you viewed your relationship as \u201cI\u2019m paying for sex\u201d then you viewed her as a prostitute. Nothing wrong with it, but words have meanings.",

Two years of ppm because we never knew when we could meet. Cashapp after every date. Gifts for travel with her kids, trips to Disney World with her kids, clothes for her, lashes, hair, nails.  She ask for more, I gave more. \n\nWas she a prostitute,  or an SB? Did the fact that I gave her cash for the pleasure of her company matter? BTW, we had a 43 year age difference. Would a bueituful 32 yo be with a man 43 years older if not for the money? Does it matter her motivation? \n\nI guess I am trying to say that paying for sex is not always prostitution.",

I wasn\u2019t there, there\u2019s an obvious difference between \u201cI\u2019m here for an hour, get naked and had me your cash\u201d vs \u201clet\u2019s spend time together, laugh and talk, cuddle, and yes have sex.\u201d\n\n>> Did the fact that I gave her cash for the pleasure of her company matter?\n\nSince cash is exchanged in both types of relationships, no, that does not matter. \n\n>> I guess I am trying to say that paying for sex is not always prostitution.\n\nYes, it is.  That is literally the definition.   If you viewed your relationship as \u201cI\u2019m paying for sex\u201d then you viewed her as a prostitute. Nothing wrong with it, but words have meanings.",
