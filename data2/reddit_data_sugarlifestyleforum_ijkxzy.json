    "body": "I had been communicating with a POT for a while and everything seemed fine with him. He was the first person that I seemed to connect to and I was really excited. So we agreed to do a M&G at an outdoor coffee shop. When we got there after our introductions he then loudly told me,  \u201cGet the F*ck away from me you gold digging sl*t.\u201d There was people around me that turned to stare and I couldn\u2019t get out of there fast enough. I was so embarrassed. \n\nI think I\u2019m going to remove myself from the pool for a while. . . I seem to not have any luck. \n\nIf you made it this far, good luck to you in your search.",

Having someone purposefully invite you out to humiliate you is insidious. I disagree that you should have confronted him. Your instincts are valuable, and they told you to get the hell out of there. You may be rightfully upset, but you were not physically harmed. There are seasoned predators on SA who understand how to act and what to say in order to exploit you, and get you where they want you. You learned this lesson early on which bodes well for your future should you decided to return to SA. Sorry this happened to you.",

I avoid using terms like \"should have\" and \"allow\" because she is a victim and we don't want her to feel responsible for the encounter. Victim blaming can happen even if we don't intend it if we aren't careful with our words. I hope OP takes some time to heal. Something like that would really shake me up if I was in her shoes. It is easy to dwell on such an event and regret not reacting differently, and I do not want to facilitate that type of negative feeling for her because she is probably feeling low from what happened already.",
