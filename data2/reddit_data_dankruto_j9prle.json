There's been other jinchuriki but never has someone united all the tailed beasts, and basically the whole ninja world. People give naruto shit because they say his handwork is discredited by all he inherited. But no one else could have done what he did with the cards he was dealt and I believe he would have been an excellent shinobi even without Karama. he did master perfect sage mode all on his own and most of his foolishness early on was because of his lack of upbringing and being shunned from society.",

He had very poor chakra control because the 9 tails kept messing with it. He worked hard to learn the rasengan and the rasenshuriken, his most used jutsu. The only reason he actually managed to use the 9 tails chakra was not because he was the reincarnation or whatever, he tamed the fox, his willpower alone did that. Despite being shunned by everyone around him, he still kept going, still didn't hate the village or wanted revenge. He saved them. In the end, it's not his powers that matter, but his attitude, aka, his talk no jutsu.",

But no one else could have done what he did with the cards he was dealt and I believe he would have been an excellent shinobi even without Karama. he did master perfect sage mode all on his own and most of his foolishness early on was because of his lack of upbringing and being shunned from society.",

He had very poor chakra control because the 9 tails kept messing with it. He worked hard to learn the rasengan and the rasenshuriken, his most used jutsu. The only reason he actually managed to use the 9 tails chakra was not because he was the reincarnation or whatever, he tamed the fox, his willpower alone did that. Despite being shunned by everyone around him, he still kept going, still didn't hate the village or wanted revenge. He saved them.

The only reason he actually managed to use the 9 tails chakra was not because he was the reincarnation or whatever, he tamed the fox, his willpower alone did that. Despite being shunned by everyone around him, he still kept going, still didn't hate the village or wanted revenge. He saved them.

The only reason he actually managed to use the 9 tails chakra was not because he was the reincarnation or whatever, he tamed the fox, his willpower alone did that. Despite being shunned by everyone around him, he still kept going, still didn't hate the village or wanted revenge. He saved them.
