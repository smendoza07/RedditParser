After a while I thought \"you know, I could probably do a better job myself.\" I was right. You just need a good sized mirror you can hold (for doing the back). I also recommend using the same clippers every time. You'll get a feel for them and you'll be a pro in no time. Post results!",

It's a lot easier to go over it two, three, four or more times taking a little at a time than taking off big chunks that now have to grow back. Get two mirrors, a large handled one like the barber uses to see the back of the head. To get the back lined up properly take a piece of string and wrap it around the back where you plan to trim to and define it and at the front hold the string in your lips. This gives you an actual physical line to follow when trimming the back.",

            "body": "Alright, I've been cutting (or at least \"touching up\") my hair at home for the better part of the past year. I'll give my advice on trying to salvage this mess.\n\nTake your clippers, put on the longest guard you have, and go over everything from the back, up to the crown of your head, and probably the sides up around the temples.\n\nFrom there, lower the guard. Do the exact same sections, but aim just a *little* lower than you previously buzzed over.\n\nNow, take a look. Is it still a harshly-defined line? Then lower the guard and do the exact same thing, but in reverse. Buzz just the *tiniest* amount of hair, all around the bottom, then raise the guard, another tiny bit higher, rinse and repeat.\n\nOnce your hair has reached a point it \"fades\" into a longer hair, I'd grab some scissors and touch up from there. That gets into trickier territory, but the goal is to try and make the \"line\" between \"the hair that you buzzed\" and \"the hair you haven't buzzed\" less prominent.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the key to a good haircut is for everything to blend together. Even if the length is *technically* different from the back of your head to the top, there should never be a \"change\" that someone can see.\n\nFinally, if you have an electric razor, I'd probably polish up the back a little bit. Or just remove the guard on your clippers, and *slightly* shave down the \"corners\" of the back of your head. Create a soft line, or no line at all if possible, fading it to \"no hair\".\n\nI mean, I would in all honesty ask if any of your friends have *any* experience, or know anyone with experience cutting hair. I'm just gonna give it to you straight; your shit is jacked up, mayne. But it can definitely be salvaged into *something*.",

I also recommend using the same clippers every time. You'll get a feel for them and you'll be a pro in no time. Post results!",
