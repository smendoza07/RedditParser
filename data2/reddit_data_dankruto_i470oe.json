So uh maybe Choji, Kiba and Rock Lee or Ten Ten? \n\nPretty unresourceful team and all about close range combat but after the top 5 of Shikamaru, Shino, Sasuke, Rock Lee and Neji, you gotta scrape the barrel. \n\nPre-Jiraya Naruto was woefully unprepared for ninja life. He went into battle with Zabuza and Haku with only knowing shadow clone jutsu. Mans should have died if it wasnt for Sasuke, crying and talk no jutsu.",

Naruto, shikamaru and Lee and sasuke, shino and Sakura would be great. I'm teaming sasuke with shino because they both are less intelligent than shikamaru but more than Naruto. It would balance out. And Naruto too has healing powers so sakura can go in the other team.",

Kiba and Shino should probably be enough for sakon but they could also leave Sakura or Hinata. Shikamaru with literally anyone else should be fine for taiyua. That leaves Naruto, Lee, Sakura or Hinata, and the sand trio to dog pile kimimaro (who may warrant summoning gamabunta) then Sasuke",

She\u2019s not even a med ninja. \n\nHave her join that sensory or interrogation division straight out of the academy. \n\nChoji got better but I wouldn\u2019t want him on a team with Sakura. So uh maybe Choji, Kiba and Rock Lee or Ten Ten? \n\nPretty unresourceful team and all about close range combat but after the top 5 of Shikamaru, Shino, Sasuke, Rock Lee and Neji, you gotta scrape the barrel. \n\nPre-Jiraya Naruto was woefully unprepared for ninja life. He went into battle with Zabuza and Haku with only knowing shadow clone jutsu. Mans should have died if it wasnt for Sasuke, crying and talk no jutsu.",

Naruto said in an episode to Konohamaru - \" the leaf has less manpower and we need to fo our missions properly.\" \n\nAll jonin and anbu were busy with more important missions, the chunins were rebuilding the village with the help of academy students and genins. \n\nAnd Sasuke himself volunteered to go to Orochimaru. The only people who knew about this was team 7 and Jiraiya iirc . Kakashi was out of town, Sakura was out of action, naruto was depressed and as for the rest, you know what happened.",

So uh maybe Choji, Kiba and Rock Lee or Ten Ten? \n\nPretty unresourceful team and all about close range combat but after the top 5 of Shikamaru, Shino, Sasuke, Rock Lee and Neji, you gotta scrape the barrel. \n\nPre-Jiraya Naruto was woefully unprepared for ninja life. He went into battle with Zabuza and Haku with only knowing shadow clone jutsu. Mans should have died if it wasnt for Sasuke, crying and talk no jutsu.",
