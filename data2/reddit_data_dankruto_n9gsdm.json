So pls don\u2019t tell me that one Punch  and a couple of rotations can knowck him out... Its clearly plot convenience, imo they should have let him win... he had clearly disabled Narutos Chakra points so even if he has 9 tails chakra he shouldn\u2019t have been able to channel it",

And he repeatedly has slips and outbreaks when she had nothing until the pregnancy and furthermore, even after being separated from Minato, it wasn\u2019t until Obito helped that Kurama busted out.\n\nNot to mention, her chakra actually has Bijuu suppressing properties, which is why Kumo tried to kidnap her.\n\nAs for life force... she birthed a child, survived an extraction and still went on to hold Kurama down until Minato was able to seal him. Naruto instantly croaked when Madara extracted Kurama. He didn\u2019t inherit her life force. Now Naruto was absolutely drained and far more intimately connected with Kurama, but the point stands.\n\nLike, how explicitly do we need to be told that Naruto\u2019s reserves are because of Kurama, not Kushina?

Also, Shukaku is a fraction of Kurama\u2019s strength. Like, not even 5%. He also became stronger without Shukaku, which really makes me wonder if the people who become Jinchuuriki are all held back by their Bijuu until they become Perfect Jinchuuriki.\n\nKushina was actually more likely to have been chosen to be Matatabi\u2019s Jinchuuriki, since B was already selected as Gyuuki\u2019s by that point, and was possibly even already the Jinchuuriki, it\u2019s hard to tell. Alternatively, she wasn\u2019t being used as a Jinchuuriki but as breeding stock for future Jinchuuriki, which is what I would\u2019ve done with her.

Neji\u2019s opinion isn\u2019t based on genealogy, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have looked down on Hinata.\n\nI think you're mixing stuff here. Neji point was that you can't escape your fate, not that your talent follows your lineage, since he was actually stronger than Hinata, but he had to defend her with his life, wich she could take at any moment, even if less talented.\n\nThe thing is, Naruto not inheriting his parent's gifts AND even so becoming Hokage, being a Hokage son himself, is actually proving Neji's point.\n\nI mean, none of them knew that at the time, so Neji thought Naruto wasn't fated to become Hokage and was fated to lose to Neji, since Neji was a talented Hyuuga and Naruto was suposedly a nobody, but Naruto beating him showed him that Naruto will was so strong he could beat someone more important and talented, therefore, \"changing\" his fate.\n\nSo yeah this all kinda went to shit with Shippuden",

Like, Naruto wasn\u2019t officially confirmed and no longer a village secret until the War Arc, and by that point he was already universally loved and respected, and a ninja with pretty much no living equal. Naruto was already going to be Hokage before he was known to be Minato\u2019s son, so him *being* Minato\u2019s son is irrelevant.",

Naruto was chosen to inherit Hagoromo\u2019s strength because he most embodied Hagoromo\u2019s ideals, and Sasuke was chosen because Hagoromo thought entrusting his legacy to only one son was his original mistake. Hagoromo outright says this when Sasuke captures the Bijuu. There\u2019s a reason it was Naruto, not Hashirama, who was gifted Hagoromo\u2019s strength.\n\nHashirama is the Naruto who had every gift. Easier time bonding with a more sane Indra incarnate. Innate gifts. More strength. More charisma. More and better supporters. Yet he failed. Just like Obito. Just like Nagato. Just like Minato. All of whom are candidates to have been the Saviour.\n\nNaruto\u2019s Ascension to Hokage has nothing to do with Minato. Naruto was already set to be the Hokage after TnJ\u2019ing Tsunade, and after winning over the people of the village, which canonically happened *before* he beat Pain. This was then cemented by his victory over Pain, which would\u2019ve been much easier without Kurama there. Kurama was a net detriment to every single one of Naruto\u2019s goals until he managed to purge the hatred from Kurama\u2019s heart.\n\nAnd just in case I need to remind you, Hamura bestowed his power upon Hinata, and Obito did for Kakashi, proving that it\u2019s got nothing to do with being an Incarnate. Literally all the Incarnate means is that Ashura\u2019s chakra and stubborn will clings to Naruto, refusing to die. It does nothing to his mind. Nothing to his power. The only evidence we have of Ashura or Indra affecting their host is when Indra was exacerbating Sasuke\u2019s insanity in the Summit Arc. Like, it only has one effect on their destiny, as it means Naruto must kill or be killed by Sasuke, which Naruto of course broke that chain of destiny.\n\nAlso, Minato would\u2019ve sealed Kurama into literally any child nearby. He just chose Naruto because he was most convenient. And this arguably made things worse, as Kushina outright says that Minato could\u2019ve lived after the sealing if he didn\u2019t use Shiki Fuujin to set up Kushina\u2019s Chakra Imprint so she could see Naruto as an adult. Naruto being Minato\u2019s son meant that the world missed out on having Minato there to off Obito after the Kurama attack, and because Naruto was then associated with Minato\u2019s death, it made getting the respect needed to be Hokage that much harder then it would\u2019ve been if Minato was alive.",

So pls don\u2019t tell me that one Punch  and a couple of rotations can knowck him out... Its clearly plot convenience, imo they should have let him win... he had clearly disabled Narutos Chakra points so even if he has 9 tails chakra he shouldn\u2019t have been able to channel it",

Also, Shukaku is a fraction of Kurama\u2019s strength. Like, not even 5%.

Neji\u2019s opinion isn\u2019t based on genealogy, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have looked down on Hinata.\n\nI think you're mixing stuff here. Neji point was that you can't escape your fate, not that your talent follows your lineage, since he was actually stronger than Hinata, but he had to defend her with his life, wich she could take at any moment, even if less talented.\n\nThe thing is, Naruto not inheriting his parent's gifts AND even so becoming Hokage, being a Hokage son himself, is actually proving Neji's point.\n\nI mean, none of them knew that at the time, so Neji thought Naruto wasn't fated to become Hokage and was fated to lose to Neji, since Neji was a talented Hyuuga and Naruto was suposedly a nobody, but Naruto beating him showed him that Naruto will was so strong he could beat someone more important and talented, therefore, \"changing\" his fate.\n\nSo yeah this all kinda went to shit with Shippuden",

Naruto was chosen to inherit Hagoromo\u2019s strength because he most embodied Hagoromo\u2019s ideals, and Sasuke was chosen because Hagoromo thought entrusting his legacy to only one son was his original mistake. Hagoromo outright says this when Sasuke captures the Bijuu. There\u2019s a reason it was Naruto, not Hashirama, who was gifted Hagoromo\u2019s strength.\n\nHashirama is the Naruto who had every gift. Easier time bonding with a more sane Indra incarnate. Innate gifts. More strength. More charisma. More and better supporters. Yet he failed. Just like Obito. Just like Nagato. Just like Minato. All of whom are candidates to have been the Saviour.\n\nNaruto\u2019s Ascension to Hokage has nothing to do with Minato. Naruto was already set to be the Hokage after TnJ\u2019ing Tsunade, and after winning over the people of the village, which canonically happened *before* he beat Pain. This was then cemented by his victory over Pain, which would\u2019ve been much easier without Kurama there. Kurama was a net detriment to every single one of Naruto\u2019s goals until he managed to purge the hatred from Kurama\u2019s heart.\n\nAnd just in case I need to remind you, Hamura bestowed his power upon Hinata, and Obito did for Kakashi, proving that it\u2019s got nothing to do with being an Incarnate. Literally all the Incarnate means is that Ashura\u2019s chakra and stubborn will clings to Naruto, refusing to die. It does nothing to his mind. Nothing to his power. The only evidence we have of Ashura or Indra affecting their host is when Indra was exacerbating Sasuke\u2019s insanity in the Summit Arc. Like, it only has one effect on their destiny, as it means Naruto must kill or be killed by Sasuke, which Naruto of course broke that chain of destiny.\n\nAlso, Minato would\u2019ve sealed Kurama into literally any child nearby. He just chose Naruto because he was most convenient. And this arguably made things worse, as Kushina outright says that Minato could\u2019ve lived after the sealing if he didn\u2019t use Shiki Fuujin to set up Kushina\u2019s Chakra Imprint so she could see Naruto as an adult. Naruto being Minato\u2019s son meant that the world missed out on having Minato there to off Obito after the Kurama attack, and because Naruto was then associated with Minato\u2019s death, it made getting the respect needed to be Hokage that much harder then it would\u2019ve been if Minato was alive.",

Also, Shukaku is a fraction of Kurama\u2019s strength. Like, not even 5%. He also became stronger without Shukaku, which really makes me wonder if the people who become Jinchuuriki are all held back by their Bijuu until they become Perfect Jinchuuriki.\n\nKushina was actually more likely to have been chosen to be Matatabi\u2019s Jinchuuriki, since B was already selected as Gyuuki\u2019s by that point, and was possibly even already the Jinchuuriki, it\u2019s hard to tell. Alternatively, she wasn\u2019t being used as a Jinchuuriki but as breeding stock for future Jinchuuriki, which is what I would\u2019ve done with her.

Neji\u2019s opinion isn\u2019t based on genealogy, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have looked down on Hinata.\n\nI think you're mixing stuff here. Neji point was that you can't escape your fate, not that your talent follows your lineage, since he was actually stronger than Hinata, but he had to defend her with his life, wich she could take at any moment, even if less talented.\n\nThe thing is, Naruto not inheriting his parent's gifts AND even so becoming Hokage, being a Hokage son himself, is actually proving Neji's point.\n\nI mean, none of them knew that at the time, so Neji thought Naruto wasn't fated to become Hokage and was fated to lose to Neji, since Neji was a talented Hyuuga and Naruto was suposedly a nobody, but Naruto beating him showed him that Naruto will was so strong he could beat someone more important and talented, therefore, \"changing\" his fate.\n\nSo yeah this all kinda went to shit with Shippuden",

Naruto was chosen to inherit Hagoromo\u2019s strength because he most embodied Hagoromo\u2019s ideals, and Sasuke was chosen because Hagoromo thought entrusting his legacy to only one son was his original mistake. Hagoromo outright says this when Sasuke captures the Bijuu. There\u2019s a reason it was Naruto, not Hashirama, who was gifted Hagoromo\u2019s strength.\n\nHashirama is the Naruto who had every gift. Easier time bonding with a more sane Indra incarnate. Innate gifts. More strength. More charisma. More and better supporters. Yet he failed. Just like Obito. Just like Nagato. Just like Minato. All of whom are candidates to have been the Saviour.\n\nNaruto\u2019s Ascension to Hokage has nothing to do with Minato. Naruto was already set to be the Hokage after TnJ\u2019ing Tsunade, and after winning over the people of the village, which canonically happened *before* he beat Pain. This was then cemented by his victory over Pain, which would\u2019ve been much easier without Kurama there. Kurama was a net detriment to every single one of Naruto\u2019s goals until he managed to purge the hatred from Kurama\u2019s heart.\n\nAnd just in case I need to remind you, Hamura bestowed his power upon Hinata, and Obito did for Kakashi, proving that it\u2019s got nothing to do with being an Incarnate. Literally all the Incarnate means is that Ashura\u2019s chakra and stubborn will clings to Naruto, refusing to die. It does nothing to his mind. Nothing to his power. The only evidence we have of Ashura or Indra affecting their host is when Indra was exacerbating Sasuke\u2019s insanity in the Summit Arc. Like, it only has one effect on their destiny, as it means Naruto must kill or be killed by Sasuke, which Naruto of course broke that chain of destiny.\n\nAlso, Minato would\u2019ve sealed Kurama into literally any child nearby. He just chose Naruto because he was most convenient. And this arguably made things worse, as Kushina outright says that Minato could\u2019ve lived after the sealing if he didn\u2019t use Shiki Fuujin to set up Kushina\u2019s Chakra Imprint so she could see Naruto as an adult. Naruto being Minato\u2019s son meant that the world missed out on having Minato there to off Obito after the Kurama attack, and because Naruto was then associated with Minato\u2019s death, it made getting the respect needed to be Hokage that much harder then it would\u2019ve been if Minato was alive.",

So pls don\u2019t tell me that one Punch  and a couple of rotations can knowck him out...

And he repeatedly has slips and outbreaks when she had nothing until the pregnancy and furthermore, even after being separated from Minato, it wasn\u2019t until Obito helped that Kurama busted out.\n\nNot to mention, her chakra actually has Bijuu suppressing properties, which is why Kumo tried to kidnap her.\n\nAs for life force... she birthed a child, survived an extraction and still went on to hold Kurama down until Minato was able to seal him. Naruto instantly croaked when Madara extracted Kurama. He didn\u2019t inherit her life force. Now Naruto was absolutely drained and far more intimately connected with Kurama, but the point stands.\n\nLike, how explicitly do we need to be told that Naruto\u2019s reserves are because of Kurama, not Kushina?

Also, Shukaku is a fraction of Kurama\u2019s strength. Like, not even 5%. He also became stronger without Shukaku, which really makes me wonder if the people who become Jinchuuriki are all held back by their Bijuu until they become Perfect Jinchuuriki.\n\nKushina was actually more likely to have been chosen to be Matatabi\u2019s Jinchuuriki, since B was already selected as Gyuuki\u2019s by that point, and was possibly even already the Jinchuuriki, it\u2019s hard to tell.

                                    "body": "Wrong. Him being Ashura\u2019s Incarnate meant nothing. Hagoromo says this himself, it grants no strength and no abilities. Naruto was chosen to inherit Hagoromo\u2019s strength because he most embodied Hagoromo\u2019s ideals, and Sasuke was chosen because Hagoromo thought entrusting his legacy to only one son was his original mistake. Hagoromo outright says this when Sasuke captures the Bijuu. There\u2019s a reason it was Naruto, not Hashirama, who was gifted Hagoromo\u2019s strength.\n\nHashirama is the Naruto who had every gift. Easier time bonding with a more sane Indra incarnate. Innate gifts. More strength. More charisma. More and better supporters. Yet he failed. Just like Obito. Just like Nagato. Just like Minato. All of whom are candidates to have been the Saviour.\n\nNaruto\u2019s Ascension to Hokage has nothing to do with Minato. Naruto was already set to be the Hokage after TnJ\u2019ing Tsunade, and after winning over the people of the village, which canonically happened *before* he beat Pain. This was then cemented by his victory over Pain, which would\u2019ve been much easier without Kurama there. Kurama was a net detriment to every single one of Naruto\u2019s goals until he managed to purge the hatred from Kurama\u2019s heart.\n\nAnd just in case I need to remind you, Hamura bestowed his power upon Hinata, and Obito did for Kakashi, proving that it\u2019s got nothing to do with being an Incarnate. Literally all the Incarnate means is that Ashura\u2019s chakra and stubborn will clings to Naruto, refusing to die. It does nothing to his mind. Nothing to his power. The only evidence we have of Ashura or Indra affecting their host is when Indra was exacerbating Sasuke\u2019s insanity in the Summit Arc. Like, it only has one effect on their destiny, as it means Naruto must kill or be killed by Sasuke, which Naruto of course broke that chain of destiny.\n\nAlso, Minato would\u2019ve sealed Kurama into literally any child nearby. He just chose Naruto because he was most convenient. And this arguably made things worse, as Kushina outright says that Minato could\u2019ve lived after the sealing if he didn\u2019t use Shiki Fuujin to set up Kushina\u2019s Chakra Imprint so she could see Naruto as an adult. Naruto being Minato\u2019s son meant that the world missed out on having Minato there to off Obito after the Kurama attack, and because Naruto was then associated with Minato\u2019s death, it made getting the respect needed to be Hokage that much harder then it would\u2019ve been if Minato was alive.",

Also, Shukaku is a fraction of Kurama\u2019s strength. Like, not even 5%.

                            "body": "Wrong. Him being Ashura\u2019s Incarnate meant nothing. Hagoromo says this himself, it grants no strength and no abilities. Naruto was chosen to inherit Hagoromo\u2019s strength because he most embodied Hagoromo\u2019s ideals, and Sasuke was chosen because Hagoromo thought entrusting his legacy to only one son was his original mistake. Hagoromo outright says this when Sasuke captures the Bijuu. There\u2019s a reason it was Naruto, not Hashirama, who was gifted Hagoromo\u2019s strength.\n\nHashirama is the Naruto who had every gift. Easier time bonding with a more sane Indra incarnate. Innate gifts. More strength. More charisma. More and better supporters. Yet he failed. Just like Obito. Just like Nagato. Just like Minato. All of whom are candidates to have been the Saviour.\n\nNaruto\u2019s Ascension to Hokage has nothing to do with Minato. Naruto was already set to be the Hokage after TnJ\u2019ing Tsunade, and after winning over the people of the village, which canonically happened *before* he beat Pain. This was then cemented by his victory over Pain, which would\u2019ve been much easier without Kurama there. Kurama was a net detriment to every single one of Naruto\u2019s goals until he managed to purge the hatred from Kurama\u2019s heart.\n\nAnd just in case I need to remind you, Hamura bestowed his power upon Hinata, and Obito did for Kakashi, proving that it\u2019s got nothing to do with being an Incarnate. Literally all the Incarnate means is that Ashura\u2019s chakra and stubborn will clings to Naruto, refusing to die. It does nothing to his mind. Nothing to his power. The only evidence we have of Ashura or Indra affecting their host is when Indra was exacerbating Sasuke\u2019s insanity in the Summit Arc. Like, it only has one effect on their destiny, as it means Naruto must kill or be killed by Sasuke, which Naruto of course broke that chain of destiny.\n\nAlso, Minato would\u2019ve sealed Kurama into literally any child nearby. He just chose Naruto because he was most convenient. And this arguably made things worse, as Kushina outright says that Minato could\u2019ve lived after the sealing if he didn\u2019t use Shiki Fuujin to set up Kushina\u2019s Chakra Imprint so she could see Naruto as an adult. Naruto being Minato\u2019s son meant that the world missed out on having Minato there to off Obito after the Kurama attack, and because Naruto was then associated with Minato\u2019s death, it made getting the respect needed to be Hokage that much harder then it would\u2019ve been if Minato was alive.",

                    "body": "Wrong. Him being Ashura\u2019s Incarnate meant nothing. Hagoromo says this himself, it grants no strength and no abilities. Naruto was chosen to inherit Hagoromo\u2019s strength because he most embodied Hagoromo\u2019s ideals, and Sasuke was chosen because Hagoromo thought entrusting his legacy to only one son was his original mistake. Hagoromo outright says this when Sasuke captures the Bijuu. There\u2019s a reason it was Naruto, not Hashirama, who was gifted Hagoromo\u2019s strength.\n\nHashirama is the Naruto who had every gift. Easier time bonding with a more sane Indra incarnate. Innate gifts. More strength. More charisma. More and better supporters. Yet he failed. Just like Obito. Just like Nagato. Just like Minato. All of whom are candidates to have been the Saviour.\n\nNaruto\u2019s Ascension to Hokage has nothing to do with Minato. Naruto was already set to be the Hokage after TnJ\u2019ing Tsunade, and after winning over the people of the village, which canonically happened *before* he beat Pain. This was then cemented by his victory over Pain, which would\u2019ve been much easier without Kurama there. Kurama was a net detriment to every single one of Naruto\u2019s goals until he managed to purge the hatred from Kurama\u2019s heart.\n\nAnd just in case I need to remind you, Hamura bestowed his power upon Hinata, and Obito did for Kakashi, proving that it\u2019s got nothing to do with being an Incarnate. Literally all the Incarnate means is that Ashura\u2019s chakra and stubborn will clings to Naruto, refusing to die. It does nothing to his mind. Nothing to his power. The only evidence we have of Ashura or Indra affecting their host is when Indra was exacerbating Sasuke\u2019s insanity in the Summit Arc. Like, it only has one effect on their destiny, as it means Naruto must kill or be killed by Sasuke, which Naruto of course broke that chain of destiny.\n\nAlso, Minato would\u2019ve sealed Kurama into literally any child nearby. He just chose Naruto because he was most convenient. And this arguably made things worse, as Kushina outright says that Minato could\u2019ve lived after the sealing if he didn\u2019t use Shiki Fuujin to set up Kushina\u2019s Chakra Imprint so she could see Naruto as an adult. Naruto being Minato\u2019s son meant that the world missed out on having Minato there to off Obito after the Kurama attack, and because Naruto was then associated with Minato\u2019s death, it made getting the respect needed to be Hokage that much harder then it would\u2019ve been if Minato was alive.",

            "body": "Wrong. Him being Ashura\u2019s Incarnate meant nothing. Hagoromo says this himself, it grants no strength and no abilities. Naruto was chosen to inherit Hagoromo\u2019s strength because he most embodied Hagoromo\u2019s ideals, and Sasuke was chosen because Hagoromo thought entrusting his legacy to only one son was his original mistake. Hagoromo outright says this when Sasuke captures the Bijuu. There\u2019s a reason it was Naruto, not Hashirama, who was gifted Hagoromo\u2019s strength.\n\nHashirama is the Naruto who had every gift. Easier time bonding with a more sane Indra incarnate. Innate gifts. More strength. More charisma. More and better supporters. Yet he failed. Just like Obito. Just like Nagato. Just like Minato. All of whom are candidates to have been the Saviour.\n\nNaruto\u2019s Ascension to Hokage has nothing to do with Minato. Naruto was already set to be the Hokage after TnJ\u2019ing Tsunade, and after winning over the people of the village, which canonically happened *before* he beat Pain. This was then cemented by his victory over Pain, which would\u2019ve been much easier without Kurama there. Kurama was a net detriment to every single one of Naruto\u2019s goals until he managed to purge the hatred from Kurama\u2019s heart.\n\nAnd just in case I need to remind you, Hamura bestowed his power upon Hinata, and Obito did for Kakashi, proving that it\u2019s got nothing to do with being an Incarnate. Literally all the Incarnate means is that Ashura\u2019s chakra and stubborn will clings to Naruto, refusing to die. It does nothing to his mind. Nothing to his power. The only evidence we have of Ashura or Indra affecting their host is when Indra was exacerbating Sasuke\u2019s insanity in the Summit Arc. Like, it only has one effect on their destiny, as it means Naruto must kill or be killed by Sasuke, which Naruto of course broke that chain of destiny.\n\nAlso, Minato would\u2019ve sealed Kurama into literally any child nearby. He just chose Naruto because he was most convenient. And this arguably made things worse, as Kushina outright says that Minato could\u2019ve lived after the sealing if he didn\u2019t use Shiki Fuujin to set up Kushina\u2019s Chakra Imprint so she could see Naruto as an adult. Naruto being Minato\u2019s son meant that the world missed out on having Minato there to off Obito after the Kurama attack, and because Naruto was then associated with Minato\u2019s death, it made getting the respect needed to be Hokage that much harder then it would\u2019ve been if Minato was alive.",

His seal was basically useless throughout most of his life, until Naruto beat Shukaku\u2019s ass so hard that Gaara actually had a few minutes to reassert his own control over his body and mind, and Karura\u2019s spirit was canonically imbued into Gaara\u2019s Sand and Chakra, so fuck knows what that does to his ability to suppress Shukaku. Also, Shukaku is a fraction of Kurama\u2019s strength. Like, not even 5%. He also became stronger without Shukaku, which really makes me wonder if the people who become Jinchuuriki are all held back by their Bijuu until they become Perfect Jinchuuriki.\n\nKushina was actually more likely to have been chosen to be Matatabi\u2019s Jinchuuriki, since B was already selected as Gyuuki\u2019s by that point, and was possibly even already the Jinchuuriki, it\u2019s hard to tell. Alternatively, she wasn\u2019t being used as a Jinchuuriki but as breeding stock for future Jinchuuriki, which is what I would\u2019ve done with her. Higher long term gains.\n\nKushina was the Ideal Jinchuuriki because she had the gifts Naruto didn\u2019t inherit.",

But from what we see, Karura\u2019s *soul* was actually *possessing* Gaara\u2019s sand.\n\nA and Minato aren\u2019t the same age. B, Minato and Kushina are the same age, A is about a decade older. \n\nNaruto very clearly doesn\u2019t have Kushina\u2019s vitality. As I pointed out, Kushina went from birthing a child to having what should be (and was for Naruto) an immediately fatal extraction and then holding Kurama down while also being impaled and still surviving for the 15 or so minutes it took Minato to do the seal.\n\nNaruto instantly croaked when he had an extraction",
