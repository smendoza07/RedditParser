Kwang Soo did something similar many episodes later when Gary and a guest were supposed to catch all of them to be able to get married, and Kwang Soo just sat with the Out members and talked to Gary the hunter.\n\nAnd if I remember correctly, this episode in the clip was also one of the first times that we saw how Jong Kook and Kwang Soo are off screen. Jong Kook and Ji Hyo were both sick, I think, and he spent much of the Name Tag hunt hiding because he didn't have energy, with Kwang Soo checking in on him/helping him around. In previous episodes, they'd mostly kept up the image of them being adversaries and Kwang Soo afraid/trying to betray, but in this episode, it was just him looking after his friend/big brother.",
