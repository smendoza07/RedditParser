Only reason why they think that is because Naruto stayed positive, upbeat kid while he could've easily turned out into homicidal maniac like Gaara. Kid likes ramen so much because it was the only thing he could eat. Nobody would sell him anything and Teuchi was only one who showed him a shred of human decency and invinted him to ramen, if he didn't Naruto would have starved to death.",

Look at the Harlow Monkey experiments where baby monkeys were given a choice between a dummy mother that would provide warmth and one that would provide food.  They chose warmth every time. \n\nAlso, these monkeys who were separated from their mothers and had no intimate contact with no one monkey or human, usually grew up so damaged to ever be around other monkeys. The males were unable to breed and the females who were artificially inseminated killed their babies. Gaara\u2019s behavior at his introduction wasn\u2019t some weird quirk that was unique to him. It was the natural conclusion of his upbringing. \n\nThe fact that Naruto has any ability to form real connections or relate to other people is astounding.",

Oh, and he was forced to fight on the frontlines of a world war at like, 12, which is similar to Naruto being a ninja and encountering threats at 12, but still a bit worse. Naruto\u2019s missions at age 12 usually just had a possibility of enemy contact, Obito\u2019s missions were actual warfare operations and had guaranteed enemies.\n\nNaruto was treated pretty badly but he was never permanently maimed or had to watch someone he loved die a brutal death. And ultimately canon showed him having decent friendly interaction with numerous kids his age and even though he was an orphan all of his bills were footed by the government. Finally, his childhood woes were something that could be rectified: case in point, he made friends and real bonds with people, which ended his misery of isolation. What happened to Obito can\u2019t be reversed. Maimed is maimed and dead is dead.\n\nAll of that said, I don\u2019t like Obito much and I don\u2019t think anything he did was justified. But I do think his childhood was worse.",

Or watching someone you love getting her heart blasted out of the back of her chest.\n\nBesides, like I said, Naruto as a show was very inconsistent on just how alone Naruto was. Initially they acted as though literally everyone hated him, but later they show him interacting with plenty of the other Konoha 11 in a pretty friendly manner on a regular basis. So how alone was he really? That said, I could be confusing fillers with canon, because I watched all episodes and it has been some time.\n\nEither way, while being hated and isolated is a very terrible thing not to be understated, nothing\u2019s worse than being dead, as there is no recovering from dead. And that being so, I feel the constant threat of one\u2019s own demise at such as young age is worse than being (arguably?) alone.",

All of that happened after one could consider Naruto a \u2018child.\u2019 The discussion is really only going up to age 12 of their lives or so, so those points are all moot.\n\nFighting a Biju doesn\u2019t really mean that much, if we\u2019re talking Shukaku. It\u2019s not like it was a traumatic experience for Naruto, to him it was just another enemy: just a big scary one.\n\nWhen it comes down to the Nine-Tails, it apparently didn\u2019t even talk to him until he was like, 12, so that only happened at the very end of his childhood, not the whole time. And having the Nine-tails saying \u2018you should die\u2019 isn\u2019t much worse than life telling Obito \u2018you\u2019re probably gonna die cuz world war and all.\u2019 Case in point, Obito practically did die if it weren\u2019t for Madara\u2019s BS hax.\n\nEither way, a lot of what you mentioned happened in Shippuden, so we can\u2019t count that as Naruto\u2019s childhood.

However, I believe he was 14 when he attacked Konoha, and 13 when Rin died. That said, if we extend the argument to all the bad stuff that happened at age 13 or younger, the point stands: Naruto\u2019s life up to 13 was really inconsistent loneliness, living on the government\u2019s dime, and the Nine-Tails occasionally tempting him (also it actually never told him to die because it didn\u2019t want him to. It gave him power tons of times so that specifically wouldn\u2019t happen). \n\nObito\u2019s life up to 13 is a child soldier on the frontlines of a war, brutally maimed, and watches someone he actually has a meaningful relationship with killed by someone he viewed as his friend.

Everywhere I\u2019ve looked said he was 14 when he fought Minato, which was a year after Rin died. If you have evidence to the contrary please share.\n\nNaruto was a child soldier but not during an actual war. His mission had the potential for enemy encounters and death but were not expected to. It\u2019s not the same as being an active duty soldier during an actual war, in which enemy contact and death is a threat on every single mission.\n\nNaruto knew Haku for less than 24 hours. They talked on friendly terms one time, and then Naruto was lead to believe that Haku killed his actual friend. You can\u2019t tell me that I don\u2019t know what he was thinking, but then claim that you do. If Naruto was traumatized by Haku\u2019s death, why does it never come up as a problem for him? Why doesn\u2019t he relive it like a nightmare? Why does he barely mention the incident even in his own thoughts? You\u2019re assuming Naruto was traumatized when he shows no evidence of being so, I\u2019m assuming he wasn\u2019t traumatized because there\u2019s no evidence that he was. Which is more reasonable?\n\nAgain with the ages. Please tell me where you are getting Obito\u2019s age from at the time of Rin\u2019s death. Either way 15 is definitely way beyond the scope of \u2018childhood\u2019 so the Pain attack on the Leaf doesn\u2019t contribute to the argument in any way. I\u2019m not sure why one casualty being a future wife (something that has no significance in the present) or the perpetrator being his cousin (so what, he\u2019s still a complete stranger) would make a difference anyway.\n\nReally, the entirety of this argument hinges on when you want to define \u2018childhood\u2019 and the canon age at which Obito saw Rin die. In fact, I don\u2019t think canon even gives Obito a clear age at any point, so we may both actually be wrong.",

Utakata\u2019s life was pretty shitty, but Han and Roshi don\u2019t get very detailed backstories. And Yagura spent most of his time brainwashed or something, but was nevertheless a Kage before that, so whether or not people disliked him at least didn\u2019t impact what heights he could reach in his village.\n\nSo arguably Naruto had it worse than some of them, possibly better than a few (Better than Gaara for sure), and with people like Han and Roshi it\u2019s unclear.",

Look at the Harlow Monkey experiments where baby monkeys were given a choice between a dummy mother that would provide warmth and one that would provide food.  They chose warmth every time. \n\nAlso, these monkeys who were separated from their mothers and had no intimate contact with no one monkey or human, usually grew up so damaged to ever be around other monkeys. The males were unable to breed and the females who were artificially inseminated killed their babies. Gaara\u2019s behavior at his introduction wasn\u2019t some weird quirk that was unique to him. It was the natural conclusion of his upbringing. \n\nThe fact that Naruto has any ability to form real connections or relate to other people is astounding.",

Any power hungry person could\u2019ve snuck in the village and kidnapped Naruto and no one would\u2019ve cared. \n\nHiruzen could\u2019ve definitely arranged something.

Remember that one episode were he started a fire to cook food... and Hiruzen joined him. They don\u2019t show it in the series that well, but Lord 3rd was taking care of Naruto from the shadows not to cause suspension that Naruto was the Leaf\u2019s jinch\u016briki. I wouldn\u2019t go as far as saying without Teuichi he would have starved. Its pretty clear in other episodes he had a ton of different instant ramen, milk, eggs, cereal and a bunch of snacks in his living quarters. He also probably had the village elders help feed him, clothe him and change his diapers until he was a toddler.",

Oh, and he was forced to fight on the frontlines of a world war at like, 12, which is similar to Naruto being a ninja and encountering threats at 12, but still a bit worse. Naruto\u2019s missions at age 12 usually just had a possibility of enemy contact, Obito\u2019s missions were actual warfare operations and had guaranteed enemies.\n\nNaruto was treated pretty badly but he was never permanently maimed or had to watch someone he loved die a brutal death. And ultimately canon showed him having decent friendly interaction with numerous kids his age and even though he was an orphan all of his bills were footed by the government. Finally, his childhood woes were something that could be rectified: case in point, he made friends and real bonds with people, which ended his misery of isolation. What happened to Obito can\u2019t be reversed. Maimed is maimed and dead is dead.\n\nAll of that said, I don\u2019t like Obito much and I don\u2019t think anything he did was justified. But I do think his childhood was worse.",

Or watching someone you love getting her heart blasted out of the back of her chest.\n\nBesides, like I said, Naruto as a show was very inconsistent on just how alone Naruto was. Initially they acted as though literally everyone hated him, but later they show him interacting with plenty of the other Konoha 11 in a pretty friendly manner on a regular basis. So how alone was he really? That said, I could be confusing fillers with canon, because I watched all episodes and it has been some time.\n\nEither way, while being hated and isolated is a very terrible thing not to be understated, nothing\u2019s worse than being dead, as there is no recovering from dead. And that being so, I feel the constant threat of one\u2019s own demise at such as young age is worse than being (arguably?) alone.",

If the worst thing that happened to one person was that their family disowned them, and the worst thing that happened to someone else is that their family died, well, one is objectively worse than the other, but subjectively it is still the \u2018worst\u2019 for each individual and therefore equally valid.\n\nEither way, Obito\u2019s childhood being worse than Naruto\u2019s is just my opinion.

All of that happened after one could consider Naruto a \u2018child.\u2019 The discussion is really only going up to age 12 of their lives or so, so those points are all moot.\n\nFighting a Biju doesn\u2019t really mean that much, if we\u2019re talking Shukaku. It\u2019s not like it was a traumatic experience for Naruto, to him it was just another enemy: just a big scary one.\n\nWhen it comes down to the Nine-Tails, it apparently didn\u2019t even talk to him until he was like, 12, so that only happened at the very end of his childhood, not the whole time. And having the Nine-tails saying \u2018you should die\u2019 isn\u2019t much worse than life telling Obito \u2018you\u2019re probably gonna die cuz world war and all.\u2019 Case in point, Obito practically did die if it weren\u2019t for Madara\u2019s BS hax.\n\nEither way, a lot of what you mentioned happened in Shippuden, so we can\u2019t count that as Naruto\u2019s childhood.

However, I believe he was 14 when he attacked Konoha, and 13 when Rin died. That said, if we extend the argument to all the bad stuff that happened at age 13 or younger, the point stands: Naruto\u2019s life up to 13 was really inconsistent loneliness, living on the government\u2019s dime, and the Nine-Tails occasionally tempting him (also it actually never told him to die because it didn\u2019t want him to. It gave him power tons of times so that specifically wouldn\u2019t happen). \n\nObito\u2019s life up to 13 is a child soldier on the frontlines of a war, brutally maimed, and watches someone he actually has a meaningful relationship with killed by someone he viewed as his friend.

Everywhere I\u2019ve looked said he was 14 when he fought Minato, which was a year after Rin died. If you have evidence to the contrary please share.\n\nNaruto was a child soldier but not during an actual war. His mission had the potential for enemy encounters and death but were not expected to. It\u2019s not the same as being an active duty soldier during an actual war, in which enemy contact and death is a threat on every single mission.\n\nNaruto knew Haku for less than 24 hours. They talked on friendly terms one time, and then Naruto was lead to believe that Haku killed his actual friend. You can\u2019t tell me that I don\u2019t know what he was thinking, but then claim that you do. If Naruto was traumatized by Haku\u2019s death, why does it never come up as a problem for him? Why doesn\u2019t he relive it like a nightmare? Why does he barely mention the incident even in his own thoughts? You\u2019re assuming Naruto was traumatized when he shows no evidence of being so, I\u2019m assuming he wasn\u2019t traumatized because there\u2019s no evidence that he was. Which is more reasonable?\n\nAgain with the ages. Please tell me where you are getting Obito\u2019s age from at the time of Rin\u2019s death. Either way 15 is definitely way beyond the scope of \u2018childhood\u2019 so the Pain attack on the Leaf doesn\u2019t contribute to the argument in any way. I\u2019m not sure why one casualty being a future wife (something that has no significance in the present) or the perpetrator being his cousin (so what, he\u2019s still a complete stranger) would make a difference anyway.\n\nReally, the entirety of this argument hinges on when you want to define \u2018childhood\u2019 and the canon age at which Obito saw Rin die. In fact, I don\u2019t think canon even gives Obito a clear age at any point, so we may both actually be wrong.",

Oh, and he was forced to fight on the frontlines of a world war at like, 12, which is similar to Naruto being a ninja and encountering threats at 12, but still a bit worse. Naruto\u2019s missions at age 12 usually just had a possibility of enemy contact, Obito\u2019s missions were actual warfare operations and had guaranteed enemies.\n\nNaruto was treated pretty badly but he was never permanently maimed or had to watch someone he loved die a brutal death. And ultimately canon showed him having decent friendly interaction with numerous kids his age and even though he was an orphan all of his bills were footed by the government. Finally, his childhood woes were something that could be rectified: case in point, he made friends and real bonds with people, which ended his misery of isolation. What happened to Obito can\u2019t be reversed. Maimed is maimed and dead is dead.\n\nAll of that said, I don\u2019t like Obito much and I don\u2019t think anything he did was justified.

Initially they acted as though literally everyone hated him, but later they show him interacting with plenty of the other Konoha 11 in a pretty friendly manner on a regular basis. So how alone was he really? That said, I could be confusing fillers with canon, because I watched all episodes and it has been some time.\n\nEither way, while being hated and isolated is a very terrible thing not to be understated, nothing\u2019s worse than being dead, as there is no recovering from dead. And that being so, I feel the constant threat of one\u2019s own demise at such as young age is worse than being (arguably?) alone.",

All of that happened after one could consider Naruto a \u2018child.\u2019 The discussion is really only going up to age 12 of their lives or so, so those points are all moot.\n\nFighting a Biju doesn\u2019t really mean that much, if we\u2019re talking Shukaku. It\u2019s not like it was a traumatic experience for Naruto, to him it was just another enemy: just a big scary one.\n\nWhen it comes down to the Nine-Tails, it apparently didn\u2019t even talk to him until he was like, 12, so that only happened at the very end of his childhood, not the whole time. And having the Nine-tails saying \u2018you should die\u2019 isn\u2019t much worse than life telling Obito \u2018you\u2019re probably gonna die cuz world war and all.\u2019 Case in point, Obito practically did die if it weren\u2019t for Madara\u2019s BS hax.\n\nEither way, a lot of what you mentioned happened in Shippuden, so we can\u2019t count that as Naruto\u2019s childhood.

Come on, Naruto May have felt bad for the guy but to call them friends is a huge stretch. At any rate Haku\u2019s demise clearly didn\u2019t traumatize him; he barely even recalled it until Haku got reanimated years later. \n\nI made an honest mistake in the age Obito was when things happened. However, I believe he was 14 when he attacked Konoha, and 13 when Rin died. That said, if we extend the argument to all the bad stuff that happened at age 13 or younger, the point stands: Naruto\u2019s life up to 13 was really inconsistent loneliness, living on the government\u2019s dime, and the Nine-Tails occasionally tempting him (also it actually never told him to die because it didn\u2019t want him to. It gave him power tons of times so that specifically wouldn\u2019t happen). \n\nObito\u2019s life up to 13 is a child soldier on the frontlines of a war, brutally maimed, and watches someone he actually has a meaningful relationship with killed by someone he viewed as his friend. I personally feel all of that is worse.",

Everywhere I\u2019ve looked said he was 14 when he fought Minato, which was a year after Rin died. If you have evidence to the contrary please share.\n\nNaruto was a child soldier but not during an actual war. His mission had the potential for enemy encounters and death but were not expected to. It\u2019s not the same as being an active duty soldier during an actual war, in which enemy contact and death is a threat on every single mission.\n\nNaruto knew Haku for less than 24 hours. They talked on friendly terms one time, and then Naruto was lead to believe that Haku killed his actual friend. You can\u2019t tell me that I don\u2019t know what he was thinking, but then claim that you do. If Naruto was traumatized by Haku\u2019s death, why does it never come up as a problem for him? Why doesn\u2019t he relive it like a nightmare? Why does he barely mention the incident even in his own thoughts? You\u2019re assuming Naruto was traumatized when he shows no evidence of being so, I\u2019m assuming he wasn\u2019t traumatized because there\u2019s no evidence that he was. Which is more reasonable?\n\nAgain with the ages. Please tell me where you are getting Obito\u2019s age from at the time of Rin\u2019s death. Either way 15 is definitely way beyond the scope of \u2018childhood\u2019 so the Pain attack on the Leaf doesn\u2019t contribute to the argument in any way. I\u2019m not sure why one casualty being a future wife (something that has no significance in the present) or the perpetrator being his cousin (so what, he\u2019s still a complete stranger) would make a difference anyway.\n\nReally, the entirety of this argument hinges on when you want to define \u2018childhood\u2019 and the canon age at which Obito saw Rin die. In fact, I don\u2019t think canon even gives Obito a clear age at any point, so we may both actually be wrong.",

Initially they acted as though literally everyone hated him, but later they show him interacting with plenty of the other Konoha 11 in a pretty friendly manner on a regular basis. So how alone was he really? That said, I could be confusing fillers with canon, because I watched all episodes and it has been some time.\n\nEither way, while being hated and isolated is a very terrible thing not to be understated, nothing\u2019s worse than being dead, as there is no recovering from dead.

All of that happened after one could consider Naruto a \u2018child.\u2019 The discussion is really only going up to age 12 of their lives or so, so those points are all moot.\n\nFighting a Biju doesn\u2019t really mean that much, if we\u2019re talking Shukaku. It\u2019s not like it was a traumatic experience for Naruto, to him it was just another enemy: just a big scary one.\n\nWhen it comes down to the Nine-Tails, it apparently didn\u2019t even talk to him until he was like, 12, so that only happened at the very end of his childhood, not the whole time. And having the Nine-tails saying \u2018you should die\u2019 isn\u2019t much worse than life telling Obito \u2018you\u2019re probably gonna die cuz world war and all.\u2019 Case in point, Obito practically did die if it weren\u2019t for Madara\u2019s BS hax.\n\nEither way, a lot of what you mentioned happened in Shippuden, so we can\u2019t count that as Naruto\u2019s childhood.

However, I believe he was 14 when he attacked Konoha, and 13 when Rin died. That said, if we extend the argument to all the bad stuff that happened at age 13 or younger, the point stands: Naruto\u2019s life up to 13 was really inconsistent loneliness, living on the government\u2019s dime, and the Nine-Tails occasionally tempting him (also it actually never told him to die because it didn\u2019t want him to. It gave him power tons of times so that specifically wouldn\u2019t happen). \n\nObito\u2019s life up to 13 is a child soldier on the frontlines of a war, brutally maimed, and watches someone he actually has a meaningful relationship with killed by someone he viewed as his friend.

Everywhere I\u2019ve looked said he was 14 when he fought Minato, which was a year after Rin died. If you have evidence to the contrary please share.\n\nNaruto was a child soldier but not during an actual war. His mission had the potential for enemy encounters and death but were not expected to. It\u2019s not the same as being an active duty soldier during an actual war, in which enemy contact and death is a threat on every single mission.\n\nNaruto knew Haku for less than 24 hours. They talked on friendly terms one time, and then Naruto was lead to believe that Haku killed his actual friend. You can\u2019t tell me that I don\u2019t know what he was thinking, but then claim that you do. If Naruto was traumatized by Haku\u2019s death, why does it never come up as a problem for him? Why doesn\u2019t he relive it like a nightmare? Why does he barely mention the incident even in his own thoughts? You\u2019re assuming Naruto was traumatized when he shows no evidence of being so, I\u2019m assuming he wasn\u2019t traumatized because there\u2019s no evidence that he was. Which is more reasonable?\n\nAgain with the ages. Please tell me where you are getting Obito\u2019s age from at the time of Rin\u2019s death. Either way 15 is definitely way beyond the scope of \u2018childhood\u2019 so the Pain attack on the Leaf doesn\u2019t contribute to the argument in any way. I\u2019m not sure why one casualty being a future wife (something that has no significance in the present) or the perpetrator being his cousin (so what, he\u2019s still a complete stranger) would make a difference anyway.\n\nReally, the entirety of this argument hinges on when you want to define \u2018childhood\u2019 and the canon age at which Obito saw Rin die. In fact, I don\u2019t think canon even gives Obito a clear age at any point, so we may both actually be wrong.",

Or watching someone you love getting her heart blasted out of the back of her chest.\n\nBesides, like I said, Naruto as a show was very inconsistent on just how alone Naruto was. Initially they acted as though literally everyone hated him, but later they show him interacting with plenty of the other Konoha 11 in a pretty friendly manner on a regular basis. So how alone was he really? That said, I could be confusing fillers with canon, because I watched all episodes and it has been some time.\n\nEither way, while being hated and isolated is a very terrible thing not to be understated, nothing\u2019s worse than being dead, as there is no recovering from dead. And that being so, I feel the constant threat of one\u2019s own demise at such as young age is worse than being (arguably?) alone.",

All of that happened after one could consider Naruto a \u2018child.\u2019 The discussion is really only going up to age 12 of their lives or so, so those points are all moot.\n\nFighting a Biju doesn\u2019t really mean that much, if we\u2019re talking Shukaku. It\u2019s not like it was a traumatic experience for Naruto, to him it was just another enemy: just a big scary one.\n\nWhen it comes down to the Nine-Tails, it apparently didn\u2019t even talk to him until he was like, 12, so that only happened at the very end of his childhood, not the whole time. And having the Nine-tails saying \u2018you should die\u2019 isn\u2019t much worse than life telling Obito \u2018you\u2019re probably gonna die cuz world war and all.\u2019 Case in point, Obito practically did die if it weren\u2019t for Madara\u2019s BS hax.\n\nEither way, a lot of what you mentioned happened in Shippuden, so we can\u2019t count that as Naruto\u2019s childhood.

However, I believe he was 14 when he attacked Konoha, and 13 when Rin died. That said, if we extend the argument to all the bad stuff that happened at age 13 or younger, the point stands: Naruto\u2019s life up to 13 was really inconsistent loneliness, living on the government\u2019s dime, and the Nine-Tails occasionally tempting him (also it actually never told him to die because it didn\u2019t want him to. It gave him power tons of times so that specifically wouldn\u2019t happen). \n\nObito\u2019s life up to 13 is a child soldier on the frontlines of a war, brutally maimed, and watches someone he actually has a meaningful relationship with killed by someone he viewed as his friend.

Everywhere I\u2019ve looked said he was 14 when he fought Minato, which was a year after Rin died. If you have evidence to the contrary please share.\n\nNaruto was a child soldier but not during an actual war. His mission had the potential for enemy encounters and death but were not expected to. It\u2019s not the same as being an active duty soldier during an actual war, in which enemy contact and death is a threat on every single mission.\n\nNaruto knew Haku for less than 24 hours. They talked on friendly terms one time, and then Naruto was lead to believe that Haku killed his actual friend. You can\u2019t tell me that I don\u2019t know what he was thinking, but then claim that you do. If Naruto was traumatized by Haku\u2019s death, why does it never come up as a problem for him? Why doesn\u2019t he relive it like a nightmare? Why does he barely mention the incident even in his own thoughts? You\u2019re assuming Naruto was traumatized when he shows no evidence of being so, I\u2019m assuming he wasn\u2019t traumatized because there\u2019s no evidence that he was. Which is more reasonable?\n\nAgain with the ages. Please tell me where you are getting Obito\u2019s age from at the time of Rin\u2019s death. Either way 15 is definitely way beyond the scope of \u2018childhood\u2019 so the Pain attack on the Leaf doesn\u2019t contribute to the argument in any way. I\u2019m not sure why one casualty being a future wife (something that has no significance in the present) or the perpetrator being his cousin (so what, he\u2019s still a complete stranger) would make a difference anyway.\n\nReally, the entirety of this argument hinges on when you want to define \u2018childhood\u2019 and the canon age at which Obito saw Rin die. In fact, I don\u2019t think canon even gives Obito a clear age at any point, so we may both actually be wrong.",

At any rate Haku\u2019s demise clearly didn\u2019t traumatize him; he barely even recalled it until Haku got reanimated years later. \n\nI made an honest mistake in the age Obito was when things happened. However, I believe he was 14 when he attacked Konoha, and 13 when Rin died. That said, if we extend the argument to all the bad stuff that happened at age 13 or younger, the point stands: Naruto\u2019s life up to 13 was really inconsistent loneliness, living on the government\u2019s dime, and the Nine-Tails occasionally tempting him (also it actually never told him to die because it didn\u2019t want him to. It gave him power tons of times so that specifically wouldn\u2019t happen). \n\nObito\u2019s life up to 13 is a child soldier on the frontlines of a war, brutally maimed, and watches someone he actually has a meaningful relationship with killed by someone he viewed as his friend. I personally feel all of that is worse.",

Everywhere I\u2019ve looked said he was 14 when he fought Minato, which was a year after Rin died. If you have evidence to the contrary please share.\n\nNaruto was a child soldier but not during an actual war. His mission had the potential for enemy encounters and death but were not expected to. It\u2019s not the same as being an active duty soldier during an actual war, in which enemy contact and death is a threat on every single mission.\n\nNaruto knew Haku for less than 24 hours. They talked on friendly terms one time, and then Naruto was lead to believe that Haku killed his actual friend. You can\u2019t tell me that I don\u2019t know what he was thinking, but then claim that you do. If Naruto was traumatized by Haku\u2019s death, why does it never come up as a problem for him? Why doesn\u2019t he relive it like a nightmare? Why does he barely mention the incident even in his own thoughts? You\u2019re assuming Naruto was traumatized when he shows no evidence of being so, I\u2019m assuming he wasn\u2019t traumatized because there\u2019s no evidence that he was. Which is more reasonable?\n\nAgain with the ages. Please tell me where you are getting Obito\u2019s age from at the time of Rin\u2019s death. Either way 15 is definitely way beyond the scope of \u2018childhood\u2019 so the Pain attack on the Leaf doesn\u2019t contribute to the argument in any way. I\u2019m not sure why one casualty being a future wife (something that has no significance in the present) or the perpetrator being his cousin (so what, he\u2019s still a complete stranger) would make a difference anyway.\n\nReally, the entirety of this argument hinges on when you want to define \u2018childhood\u2019 and the canon age at which Obito saw Rin die. In fact, I don\u2019t think canon even gives Obito a clear age at any point, so we may both actually be wrong.",

Which is \u2018worse\u2019 depends on what the person in question values. \n\nThis is why \u2018who had it worse\u2019 debates are kind of silly. Objectively, some things are worse than others: but subjectively, it\u2019s wrong to tell someone that the personal experiences that ruined their life are somehow less meaningful than the experiences that ruined the life of someone else. If the worst thing that happened to one person was that their family disowned them, and the worst thing that happened to someone else is that their family died, well, one is objectively worse than the other, but subjectively it is still the \u2018worst\u2019 for each individual and therefore equally valid.\n\nEither way, Obito\u2019s childhood being worse than Naruto\u2019s is just my opinion. I won\u2019t say anyone disagreeing with me is objectively wrong.",

Come on, Naruto May have felt bad for the guy but to call them friends is a huge stretch. At any rate Haku\u2019s demise clearly didn\u2019t traumatize him; he barely even recalled it until Haku got reanimated years later. \n\nI made an honest mistake in the age Obito was when things happened. However, I believe he was 14 when he attacked Konoha, and 13 when Rin died. That said, if we extend the argument to all the bad stuff that happened at age 13 or younger, the point stands: Naruto\u2019s life up to 13 was really inconsistent loneliness, living on the government\u2019s dime, and the Nine-Tails occasionally tempting him (also it actually never told him to die because it didn\u2019t want him to. It gave him power tons of times so that specifically wouldn\u2019t happen). \n\nObito\u2019s life up to 13 is a child soldier on the frontlines of a war, brutally maimed, and watches someone he actually has a meaningful relationship with killed by someone he viewed as his friend. I personally feel all of that is worse.",

Everywhere I\u2019ve looked said he was 14 when he fought Minato, which was a year after Rin died. If you have evidence to the contrary please share.\n\nNaruto was a child soldier but not during an actual war. His mission had the potential for enemy encounters and death but were not expected to. It\u2019s not the same as being an active duty soldier during an actual war, in which enemy contact and death is a threat on every single mission.\n\nNaruto knew Haku for less than 24 hours. They talked on friendly terms one time, and then Naruto was lead to believe that Haku killed his actual friend. You can\u2019t tell me that I don\u2019t know what he was thinking, but then claim that you do. If Naruto was traumatized by Haku\u2019s death, why does it never come up as a problem for him? Why doesn\u2019t he relive it like a nightmare? Why does he barely mention the incident even in his own thoughts? You\u2019re assuming Naruto was traumatized when he shows no evidence of being so, I\u2019m assuming he wasn\u2019t traumatized because there\u2019s no evidence that he was. Which is more reasonable?\n\nAgain with the ages. Please tell me where you are getting Obito\u2019s age from at the time of Rin\u2019s death. Either way 15 is definitely way beyond the scope of \u2018childhood\u2019 so the Pain attack on the Leaf doesn\u2019t contribute to the argument in any way. I\u2019m not sure why one casualty being a future wife (something that has no significance in the present) or the perpetrator being his cousin (so what, he\u2019s still a complete stranger) would make a difference anyway.\n\nReally, the entirety of this argument hinges on when you want to define \u2018childhood\u2019 and the canon age at which Obito saw Rin die. In fact, I don\u2019t think canon even gives Obito a clear age at any point, so we may both actually be wrong.",

Everywhere I\u2019ve looked said he was 14 when he fought Minato, which was a year after Rin died. If you have evidence to the contrary please share.\n\nNaruto was a child soldier but not during an actual war. His mission had the potential for enemy encounters and death but were not expected to. It\u2019s not the same as being an active duty soldier during an actual war, in which enemy contact and death is a threat on every single mission.\n\nNaruto knew Haku for less than 24 hours. They talked on friendly terms one time, and then Naruto was lead to believe that Haku killed his actual friend. You can\u2019t tell me that I don\u2019t know what he was thinking, but then claim that you do. If Naruto was traumatized by Haku\u2019s death, why does it never come up as a problem for him? Why doesn\u2019t he relive it like a nightmare? Why does he barely mention the incident even in his own thoughts? You\u2019re assuming Naruto was traumatized when he shows no evidence of being so, I\u2019m assuming he wasn\u2019t traumatized because there\u2019s no evidence that he was. Which is more reasonable?\n\nAgain with the ages. Please tell me where you are getting Obito\u2019s age from at the time of Rin\u2019s death. Either way 15 is definitely way beyond the scope of \u2018childhood\u2019 so the Pain attack on the Leaf doesn\u2019t contribute to the argument in any way. I\u2019m not sure why one casualty being a future wife (something that has no significance in the present) or the perpetrator being his cousin (so what, he\u2019s still a complete stranger) would make a difference anyway.\n\nReally, the entirety of this argument hinges on when you want to define \u2018childhood\u2019 and the canon age at which Obito saw Rin die. In fact, I don\u2019t think canon even gives Obito a clear age at any point, so we may both actually be wrong.",

If you have evidence to the contrary please share.\n\nNaruto was a child soldier but not during an actual war. His mission had the potential for enemy encounters and death but were not expected to. It\u2019s not the same as being an active duty soldier during an actual war, in which enemy contact and death is a threat on every single mission.\n\nNaruto knew Haku for less than 24 hours. They talked on friendly terms one time, and then Naruto was lead to believe that Haku killed his actual friend. You can\u2019t tell me that I don\u2019t know what he was thinking, but then claim that you do. If Naruto was traumatized by Haku\u2019s death, why does it never come up as a problem for him? Why doesn\u2019t he relive it like a nightmare? Why does he barely mention the incident even in his own thoughts? You\u2019re assuming Naruto was traumatized when he shows no evidence of being so, I\u2019m assuming he wasn\u2019t traumatized because there\u2019s no evidence that he was. Which is more reasonable?\n\nAgain with the ages. Please tell me where you are getting Obito\u2019s age from at the time of Rin\u2019s death. Either way 15 is definitely way beyond the scope of \u2018childhood\u2019 so the Pain attack on the Leaf doesn\u2019t contribute to the argument in any way. I\u2019m not sure why one casualty being a future wife (something that has no significance in the present) or the perpetrator being his cousin (so what, he\u2019s still a complete stranger) would make a difference anyway.\n\nReally, the entirety of this argument hinges on when you want to define \u2018childhood\u2019 and the canon age at which Obito saw Rin die. In fact, I don\u2019t think canon even gives Obito a clear age at any point, so we may both actually be wrong.",

He was only looking out for himself and tried to weaken the seal so that he could posses him. Gyuki did that with Blue B, his father, his uncle as well and Shukaku did the same thing with Gaara. Isobu also tried to posses Rin when he was sealed inside of her.",
