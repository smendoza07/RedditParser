You can get samples if you have a store near you(if they\u2019re still open). I apply to slightly damp hair post shower after towel drying, work it in with my hand, then use the blow dryer with a circular pronged brush to style. I think something like that routine/product will suit you well, we have very similar hair and cut. Hold tends to last the day, doesn\u2019t fair well if you touch your hair too much though, it\u2019ll grease up slightly.",

            "body": "Looking good! I think it could look even better by using even less pomade, though \u2014 your hair still looks like it has some \u2018crunchiness\u2019 (unless that\u2019s the look you\u2019re going for, in which case disregard everything below!)\n\nTo be able to use less pomade, you need to grow out the top. Because of your hair texture (straight and thick), your hair will always want to stick out in the direction it naturally grows. You can tell where it wants to naturally grow by looking at the angle it grows out of your head from (at the root of the hair). For you, it looks like the hairs on the right side of your part would naturally stick out to the left, and probably require the most effort to hold in place when combed over. By growing out that hair, the hair itself will become heavier and weight itself down as it sits to the right, requiring less product to be held in that position. If you want to do this, just tell your barber/stylist that you\u2019re trying to grow out the top so that it\u2019ll more naturally comb over without as much product. Hope this is helpful!",

Be careful though, a little goes a long way and too much leaves your hair feeling stiff and unmanageable.

I would recommend Dry Paste by MVRCK. it's a medium hold, matte clay pomade but I would argue it has a stronger hold than medium.",

However, if you ever want to go for an everyday casual vibe, I usually go for a pomade with high hold and low shine. I use Hanz de fuko quicksand on casual days and if I\u2019m dressing up or want to add a little pizazz I\u2019ll go with something with more shine. Looking sharp.",
