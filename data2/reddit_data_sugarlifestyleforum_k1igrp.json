    "body": "A year ago I posted on how to end a 4 year arrangement since my SB had found a vanilla relationship.  After some great feedback from the readers I had her decide which direction she wanted to take. We decided to stop seeing each other. \n\nThat lasted three months until we both realized how much we missed having each other in each others lives. Our relationship wasn't about sex and money we were friends and lovers.\n\nShe started working with me while I trained her and she obtained her professional license . Her lease was up on her apartment.  I told her I knew a place that was close to work. We decided that she would move in.\n\nMy last post was about the best and worst week of my live. The week she moved in I found out my cancer had returned. I told her that she hadn't signed up for this and I was sicker than I had been last time. I told her she could change her mind. She told me we were going to fight this together. I promised her that I wouldn't die on her but didn't tell her I had a 40% chance of living. \n\nI started my treatment which was one 5 hour day of chemo and the second day they shot chemo into my spine and brain to keep the cancer from spreading to those areas. I was a very sick man. B was there everyday for me on my okay and bad days. \n\nI went to take care of end of life arrangements which included changing my will to make sure B would be taken care of while she finished school and got a great start on life. I came back and gave her a copy of my will. She read it and put it down. She told me I don't want your money I want you. I have been married twice and neither wife has ever told me that before. \n\nB has given me the will to live. The strength to fight the toughest battle of my life. To live and plan for our future not thinking that we wouldn't have one.\n\nI just went in for a Pet scan after my third treatment. It was to see what they were doing was working, if they needed  to try something else or there was nothing else that they could do. \n\nI am happy to say I received a clean PET scan with no signs of cancer. I still need to complete my next three treatments but I will live. We will be able to be in each others lives and plan for a future. \n\nWhen we have dinner with our dogs today we will be giving thanks for many things.  The thing that I give most thanks to is my Angle. B thanks for being their for me and I will always love you.\n\nD",
