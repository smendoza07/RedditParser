It\u2019s getting close to kitchen closing time, about 5 minutes. and my Soon to SD walks through the door with a few of his buddies and restaurant opened right back up. (His family owns it). \nWe sat at a round table in the corner of the restaurant over looking the water, start ordering drinks, food, laughing, chatting, had the restaurant sing my best friend happy birthday. \n\nI knew of my future SD and his family in terms of the business world and my state politics but never met him. I had made an innocent comment that the kitchens going to close and he laughed and said we\u2019d be okay. There was a point throughout dinner where he asked for a sip out of my martini and took a bite of my desert or something and I was thinking to myself who the fuck is this person eating off my plate lol. We had exchanged contact info. That night he had texted me and the next morning. We grabbed lunch the following week and the rest is history. Come to find out the whole time I was on a blind date set up by my friend lol.",

I had made an innocent comment that the kitchens going to close and he laughed and said we\u2019d be okay. There was a point throughout dinner where he asked for a sip out of my martini and took a bite of my desert or something and I was thinking to myself who the fuck is this person eating off my plate lol. We had exchanged contact info. That night he had texted me and the next morning. We grabbed lunch the following week and the rest is history.

It\u2019s getting close to kitchen closing time, about 5 minutes. and my Soon to SD walks through the door with a few of his buddies and restaurant opened right back up. (His family owns it). \nWe sat at a round table in the corner of the restaurant over looking the water, start ordering drinks, food, laughing, chatting, had the restaurant sing my best friend happy birthday. \n\nI knew of my future SD and his family in terms of the business world and my state politics but never met him. I had made an innocent comment that the kitchens going to close and he laughed and said we\u2019d be okay. There was a point throughout dinner where he asked for a sip out of my martini and took a bite of my desert or something and I was thinking to myself who the fuck is this person eating off my plate lol. We had exchanged contact info. That night he had texted me and the next morning. We grabbed lunch the following week and the rest is history. Come to find out the whole time I was on a blind date set up by my friend lol.",
