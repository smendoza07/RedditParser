Besides her chest they didn\u2019t really ruin her so she\u2019s fine.\n\nIno plays a very useful role for the village these days after being borderline useless in part 1 and half of Shippuden so she\u2019s fine\n\nKiba got the most design love and decent screentime. He\u2019s also a high ranking police force investigator, famous actor and has a brand new dog he\u2019s training to be stronger than Akamaru. I would\u2019ve preferred if he became an Anbu but most people would say he\u2019s fine\n\nSai is kinda just there, they stopped caring for him after his little character arc in Shippuden tbh\n\nShino got massacred, no explanation needed\n\nChoji I couldn\u2019t care less about since he\u2019s also been a \u2018just there\u2019 character since his peak in the retrieval arc. Although like Kiba, I can really appreciate how they brought back his oldschool look, suits him better than that red shit and hedgehog hairstyle.\n\nRock Lee was violated with his spooky scary skeletons lookin homeless ass not to mention how he gets bodied off screen regularly now lmao\n\nYou can\u2019t possibly make Tenten worse as she falls in the same category as Choji except she\u2019s never been interesting at any point in the series. She got a way better design and actually shows more personality than she ever did prior so she\u2019s much better now.\n\nShikamaru\u2019s also thriving as he has one of the highest jobs in the leaf and actually learned some solid attack jutsus. Really hasn\u2019t changed at all besides his look.\n\nLastly design wise I think Naruto\u2019s short hair makes him come off much more normal and mature and Sasuke\u2019s design alone made me become a Sasuke fan after despising him for most of Shippuden. Personality wise they\u2019ve matured tremendously too. They were done catastrophically dirty with the nerf though but I guess it makes sense to let the new genin thrive.\n\nIn general I\u2019d say the main Naruto cast were more \u2018ruined\u2019 because of the lack of screentime and irrelevancy, not really design and personality (aside from Shino and Lee)",

Due to those characters no longer being the main focus of the story, they\u2019ve been sidelined, leading many fans to feel disconnected from the plot, as it\u2019s vastly different to what they know and love.\n\nIn short, if Kishimoto were to restart, and he fully utilized the characters that he\u2019s already created, the story would be much easier to write, which would undoubtedly lead to a much more fleshed out story that resonates with the fans more than Boruto ever could.",

In Boruto on the other hand, Boruto, Mitsuki and Sarada already look way more competent than Konohamaru. They have done way more than Konohamaru and have much more impressive feats than him which is weird considering Konohamaru is one of the best Jonins in the leaf at the moment. Naruto had Jonins like Guy, Kakashi and even Asuma to some extent was cool and made an impact. No Jonin in Boruto has done shit till now. Atleast let Boruto and Co. be around 16-17 years old before making them surpass the previous generation.",

New gen on the other hand, Boruto (two OP KG Jougan and Karma alongside chunin level ninjutsu), Sarada (literally one of the last Uchiha, but also with Sakura chakra control), Kawaki (Karma alongside modified body and a training more tortourous than even the OG 7) and Mitsuki (literally genetically engineered offspring of Orochimaru whose memory were reset until he could manifest a super strong sage transformation).\n\nThe Kekkei Genkai gap, just like in Naruto, is still a big deal here.

You know just by looking at them that the actors are well into their 20s and 30s, they've clearly got their shit together, they don't have to deal with acne anymore (well, mostly) and they actually have the time to do their hair/face professionally every single day?

Besides her chest they didn\u2019t really ruin her so she\u2019s fine.\n\nIno plays a very useful role for the village these days after being borderline useless in part 1 and half of Shippuden so she\u2019s fine\n\nKiba got the most design love and decent screentime. He\u2019s also a high ranking police force investigator, famous actor and has a brand new dog he\u2019s training to be stronger than Akamaru. I would\u2019ve preferred if he became an Anbu but most people would say he\u2019s fine\n\nSai is kinda just there, they stopped caring for him after his little character arc in Shippuden tbh\n\nShino got massacred, no explanation needed\n\nChoji I couldn\u2019t care less about since he\u2019s also been a \u2018just there\u2019 character since his peak in the retrieval arc. Although like Kiba, I can really appreciate how they brought back his oldschool look, suits him better than that red shit and hedgehog hairstyle.\n\nRock Lee was violated with his spooky scary skeletons lookin homeless ass not to mention how he gets bodied off screen regularly now lmao\n\nYou can\u2019t possibly make Tenten worse as she falls in the same category as Choji except she\u2019s never been interesting at any point in the series. She got a way better design and actually shows more personality than she ever did prior so she\u2019s much better now.\n\nShikamaru\u2019s also thriving as he has one of the highest jobs in the leaf and actually learned some solid attack jutsus. Really hasn\u2019t changed at all besides his look.\n\nLastly design wise I think Naruto\u2019s short hair makes him come off much more normal and mature and Sasuke\u2019s design alone made me become a Sasuke fan after despising him for most of Shippuden. Personality wise they\u2019ve matured tremendously too. They were done catastrophically dirty with the nerf though but I guess it makes sense to let the new genin thrive.\n\nIn general I\u2019d say the main Naruto cast were more \u2018ruined\u2019 because of the lack of screentime and irrelevancy, not really design and personality (aside from Shino and Lee)",

The definition of bitching is the action or practice of grumbling or expressing **displeasure**. I'm not here to argue with the meme, just wanted to point out that the guy who got downvoted is not actually \"literally the only one bitching here\". That's why I said we must be looking at different posts because there are certainly others in here expressing their displeasure. Hope this clears it up man \ud83d\ude42",

He had to find completely new motives and character traits to separate the kids from the established characters, and largely failed to do so. \n\nIf he were to write the story utilizing the already established characters and their already established motives and traits, it would be a lot easier to write a more unique and interesting story, as he could expand on what he and the fans are already very familiar with.\n\nWe got a very intimate look at who Naruto and company are as characters, and for some of us, it impacted our lives as a whole. Due to those characters no longer being the main focus of the story, they\u2019ve been sidelined, leading many fans to feel disconnected from the plot, as it\u2019s vastly different to what they know and love.\n\nIn short, if Kishimoto were to restart, and he fully utilized the characters that he\u2019s already created, the story would be much easier to write, which would undoubtedly lead to a much more fleshed out story that resonates with the fans more than Boruto ever could.",

In Boruto on the other hand, Boruto, Mitsuki and Sarada already look way more competent than Konohamaru. They have done way more than Konohamaru and have much more impressive feats than him which is weird considering Konohamaru is one of the best Jonins in the leaf at the moment. Naruto had Jonins like Guy, Kakashi and even Asuma to some extent was cool and made an impact. No Jonin in Boruto has done shit till now. Atleast let Boruto and Co. be around 16-17 years old before making them surpass the previous generation.",

You know just by looking at them that the actors are well into their 20s and 30s, they've clearly got their shit together, they don't have to deal with acne anymore (well, mostly) and they actually have the time to do their hair/face professionally every single day?

Due to those characters no longer being the main focus of the story, they\u2019ve been sidelined, leading many fans to feel disconnected from the plot, as it\u2019s vastly different to what they know and love.\n\nIn short, if Kishimoto were to restart, and he fully utilized the characters that he\u2019s already created, the story would be much easier to write, which would undoubtedly lead to a much more fleshed out story that resonates with the fans more than Boruto ever could.",

That's why I said we must be looking at different posts because there are certainly others in here expressing their displeasure. Hope this clears it up man \ud83d\ude42",
