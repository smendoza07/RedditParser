Different kinds of people all see the trending topics appear even if they aren't following those topics. Maybe arguing with each other drives engagement which is why you see it more often, I don't know.\n\nBesides, Reddit is not immune to the phenomenon that the user I replied to was talking about. That's why you see people comment about how \"reddit is diverse and has different opinions, it's not a monolith, etc etc\". Twitter is not a monolith so the \"people\" using twitter can have seemingly contradictory views because they aren't the same groups of people.",

In fact, there is a trend where subreddits prefer to be excluded from r/all to avoid brigading or to prevent the general reddit userbase from finding them.\n\nTwitter doesn't have that, at least not really. Different kinds of people all see the trending topics appear even if they aren't following those topics. Maybe arguing with each other drives engagement which is why you see it more often, I don't know.\n\nBesides, Reddit is not immune to the phenomenon that the user I replied to was talking about. That's why you see people comment about how \"reddit is diverse and has different opinions, it's not a monolith, etc etc\". Twitter is not a monolith so the \"people\" using twitter can have seemingly contradictory views because they aren't the same groups of people.",

In fact, there is a trend where subreddits prefer to be excluded from r/all to avoid brigading or to prevent the general reddit userbase from finding them.\n\nTwitter doesn't have that, at least not really. Different kinds of people all see the trending topics appear even if they aren't following those topics. Maybe arguing with each other drives engagement which is why you see it more often, I don't know.\n\nBesides, Reddit is not immune to the phenomenon that the user I replied to was talking about. That's why you see people comment about how \"reddit is diverse and has different opinions, it's not a monolith, etc etc\". Twitter is not a monolith so the \"people\" using twitter can have seemingly contradictory views because they aren't the same groups of people.",

Idk if it's a couch or qualifies as something else, he doesn't sleep in the same bed or room as Hinata. \n\nEven if that last ep of Shippuden is their conception of Naruto and Hinata, Japanese marraiges aren't really like that in general. They aren't super romantic or lovey dovey or whatever.",

We do know that they are married and have 2 kids so fan arts like this do make sense. Maybe Naruto doesnt do this everyday but he might have done it once or twice in 15 years of his marriage. My point is that we all are just making head canons regarding this. None of us have any clue as to how their married life is.",

Different kinds of people all see the trending topics appear even if they aren't following those topics. Maybe arguing with each other drives engagement which is why you see it more often, I don't know.\n\nBesides, Reddit is not immune to the phenomenon that the user I replied to was talking about. That's why you see people comment about how \"reddit is diverse and has different opinions, it's not a monolith, etc etc\". Twitter is not a monolith so the \"people\" using twitter can have seemingly contradictory views because they aren't the same groups of people.",

Different kinds of people all see the trending topics appear even if they aren't following those topics. Maybe arguing with each other drives engagement which is why you see it more often, I don't know.\n\nBesides, Reddit is not immune to the phenomenon that the user I replied to was talking about. That's why you see people comment about how \"reddit is diverse and has different opinions, it's not a monolith, etc etc\". Twitter is not a monolith so the \"people\" using twitter can have seemingly contradictory views because they aren't the same groups of people.",

Different kinds of people all see the trending topics appear even if they aren't following those topics. Maybe arguing with each other drives engagement which is why you see it more often, I don't know.\n\nBesides, Reddit is not immune to the phenomenon that the user I replied to was talking about. That's why you see people comment about how \"reddit is diverse and has different opinions, it's not a monolith, etc etc\". Twitter is not a monolith so the \"people\" using twitter can have seemingly contradictory views because they aren't the same groups of people.",

In fact, there is a trend where subreddits prefer to be excluded from r/all to avoid brigading or to prevent the general reddit userbase from finding them.\n\nTwitter doesn't have that, at least not really. Different kinds of people all see the trending topics appear even if they aren't following those topics. Maybe arguing with each other drives engagement which is why you see it more often, I don't know.\n\nBesides, Reddit is not immune to the phenomenon that the user I replied to was talking about. That's why you see people comment about how \"reddit is diverse and has different opinions, it's not a monolith, etc etc\". Twitter is not a monolith so the \"people\" using twitter can have seemingly contradictory views because they aren't the same groups of people.",
