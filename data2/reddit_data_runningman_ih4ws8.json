He even has the guts to betray Jong Kook or giving him some petty revenge loool Sometimes he gets scared of the nagging, but overall he has this \"I'm the oldest and I lived long enough so f*ck it\" vibe \ud83d\ude02\n\nHe is so funny with Jihyo, but I love how he is when he's paired with Jong Kook as well. Because of those two reactions which are priceless!",
