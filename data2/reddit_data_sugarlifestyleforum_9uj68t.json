We met for a nice dinner, and I asked her if she had voted. She said no. I was a little shocked, she was a college art student and seemed to be politically engaged and genuinely concerned about women's rights and other important issues. I probably lectured her too much on how important it is to vote. But our date went well and it turned into a nice long term SR.\n\nFrom time to time, she would mention how much she regretted not voting. Obviously her one vote wouldn't have changed the outcome, but she told me she always felt bad about not doing her part. We're still friendly although we now live on opposite coasts. But she texted me last night to remind me to vote today.\n\n&#x200B;",

And states where MOST people vote by mail, but voting in person is still an option, generally don't have long lines to vote in person. But different states in the US have very different voting systems. In some states, voting in person on Election Day is the only option. Surprise, those are the states that have the biggest problem with long lines.",

After that, she got clingy and expected I was looking for a vanilla LTR with her, etc. I thought to myself, I don't need this.  So I looked into alternatives and have been sugaring since.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit:  too late now for 2018, but maybe a chance for freelancing.  Guys, go democratic, lots of coeds hanging at those propaganda tents looking for candidates supporting free tuition, Girls switch to republican. Lots of rich guys with nothing else to do but hang around in those tents. ",

And states where MOST people vote by mail, but voting in person is still an option, generally don't have long lines to vote in person. But different states in the US have very different voting systems. In some states, voting in person on Election Day is the only option.

And states where MOST people vote by mail, but voting in person is still an option, generally don't have long lines to vote in person. But different states in the US have very different voting systems. In some states, voting in person on Election Day is the only option.

And states where MOST people vote by mail, but voting in person is still an option, generally don't have long lines to vote in person. But different states in the US have very different voting systems. In some states, voting in person on Election Day is the only option. Surprise, those are the states that have the biggest problem with long lines.",
