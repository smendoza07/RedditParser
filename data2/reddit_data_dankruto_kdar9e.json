For example everyone laughs at Kurenai, just because she lose against Itachi. But Obito couldn't genjutsu Itachi's teammate, who was a genjutsu user, but actually regular human, so not Uchiha. The guy could resist Obito's genjutsu. And I don't think that guy is better at genjutsu than Kurenai. Kurenai is very skilled at genjutsu, she just faced the literally worst opponent ever, Itachi. But it doesn't makes her bad. Kurenai could easily fight every other Uchihas in terms of genjutsu.",

You need someone or yourself to wake you out of genjutsu, for a fact. That takes time, for a fact. During that time the uchiha just kills you. I can believe that. Itachi stomped orochimaru solo with just a look, obito stomped Kurama solo with just a look, if you aren\u2019t a perfect jin or hashirama who is immune to anything that makes him weaker than anyone else, than you\u2019re kinda screwed against even basic genjutsu. Against uchiha genjutsu you\u2019re gonna die unless you get help. That\u2019s why obito never genjutsu\u2019d minato because it would have been a instant stomp. Genjutsu fell off as the series went on because it\u2019s unbeatable if you\u2019re alone or not a jinjuriki. All madara had to do was genjutsu guy and non of that could have happened because he would have interrupted them until someone could physically get to guy, wake him up, and get him fighting all over again. Jiraiya last ditch survival move was genjutsu because he knew if pain got caught by himself, it\u2019s an instant win for him. Genjutsu is boosted. Genjutsu is a instant win in a one on one fight and you trap the other person. Orochimaru trapped hiruzen in a basic genjutsu and it took the most experienced hokage all his effort to barley make it out. A normal shinobi solo is not defeating a uchiha or a uchiha genjutsu.",

I mean sure, he can do Sharingan genjutsus like every Uchiha can, but he really isn't as strong. He uses Kamui, so he likes physical combat, coz he is OP in that.\n\nAnd yes, you're actually right. I mean genjutsu is underrated by many people, while it is just as strong as ninjutsu, if you are good enough with it.

She might have a way easier time fighting off Amaterasu, or Kamui, or tsyukiomi, but I do not think anyone is immune to the genjutsu. Just have easier times with it.

I mean they don't give a fuck about anything. In Boruto when one of them attacked the Chuunin exam or what (idk. I never watched it, just saw the fight), Shikamaru catched him with shadow possession and the guy just casually broke out of it.

After that moment you saw the look in itachis face and he knew he couldn\u2019t toy around in reality with sasuke. Too smart. He started trying after that point, but he was never serious he could kill sasuke any second and he proved that by letting sasuke throw everything he had at him until he had 0 chakra, and only then did Itachi fight back and he still had susanoo. Sasuke would have been a skid mark if it was a real fight",

The guy could resist Obito's genjutsu. And I don't think that guy is better at genjutsu than Kurenai. Kurenai is very skilled at genjutsu, she just faced the literally worst opponent ever, Itachi.

You need someone or yourself to wake you out of genjutsu, for a fact. That takes time, for a fact. During that time the uchiha just kills you. I can believe that. Itachi stomped orochimaru solo with just a look, obito stomped Kurama solo with just a look, if you aren\u2019t a perfect jin or hashirama who is immune to anything that makes him weaker than anyone else, than you\u2019re kinda screwed against even basic genjutsu. Against uchiha genjutsu you\u2019re gonna die unless you get help. That\u2019s why obito never genjutsu\u2019d minato because it would have been a instant stomp. Genjutsu fell off as the series went on because it\u2019s unbeatable if you\u2019re alone or not a jinjuriki. All madara had to do was genjutsu guy and non of that could have happened because he would have interrupted them until someone could physically get to guy, wake him up, and get him fighting all over again. Jiraiya last ditch survival move was genjutsu because he knew if pain got caught by himself, it\u2019s an instant win for him. Genjutsu is boosted. Genjutsu is a instant win in a one on one fight and you trap the other person. Orochimaru trapped hiruzen in a basic genjutsu and it took the most experienced hokage all his effort to barley make it out. A normal shinobi solo is not defeating a uchiha or a uchiha genjutsu.",

I mean sure, he can do Sharingan genjutsus like every Uchiha can, but he really isn't as strong. He uses Kamui, so he likes physical combat, coz he is OP in that.\n\nAnd yes, you're actually right. I mean genjutsu is underrated by many people, while it is just as strong as ninjutsu, if you are good enough with it. And regular ninjas have literally no chance to escape from a genjutsu, casted by an Uchiha.",

Itachi might lose against a group of people but he has a shot of winning against anyone solo with that boosted ass genjutsu. The only question is.....does having a rinnegan or being more godly make you immune? Kaguya was not immune to Amaterasu, was not immune to Kamui, so I can\u2019t just assume she would be immune to another eye jutsu just because she\u2019s a higher level uchiha. She might have a way easier time fighting off Amaterasu, or Kamui, or tsyukiomi, but I do not think anyone is immune to the genjutsu. Just have easier times with it. Sasuke wasn\u2019t even immune to it, he just said he was starting to see through it, as well as see it.",

Madara with EMS would be able to resist Itachi most of the time. Long enough to pull out the Perfect Susanoo and destroy the place. And the Otsutsukis are generally OP. I mean they don't give a fuck about anything. In Boruto when one of them attacked the Chuunin exam or what (idk. I never watched it, just saw the fight), Shikamaru catched him with shadow possession and the guy just casually broke out of it. I don't think any Otsutsuki can be genjutsud or at least they can break out of it for sure. Otherwise Sasuke would just genjutsu them with his Rinnegan+Sharingan and would be GG. IMO.",

You need someone or yourself to wake you out of genjutsu, for a fact. That takes time, for a fact. During that time the uchiha just kills you. I can believe that. Itachi stomped orochimaru solo with just a look, obito stomped Kurama solo with just a look, if you aren\u2019t a perfect jin or hashirama who is immune to anything that makes him weaker than anyone else, than you\u2019re kinda screwed against even basic genjutsu. Against uchiha genjutsu you\u2019re gonna die unless you get help. That\u2019s why obito never genjutsu\u2019d minato because it would have been a instant stomp. Genjutsu fell off as the series went on because it\u2019s unbeatable if you\u2019re alone or not a jinjuriki. All madara had to do was genjutsu guy and non of that could have happened because he would have interrupted them until someone could physically get to guy, wake him up, and get him fighting all over again. Jiraiya last ditch survival move was genjutsu because he knew if pain got caught by himself, it\u2019s an instant win for him. Genjutsu is boosted. Genjutsu is a instant win in a one on one fight and you trap the other person. Orochimaru trapped hiruzen in a basic genjutsu and it took the most experienced hokage all his effort to barley make it out. A normal shinobi solo is not defeating a uchiha or a uchiha genjutsu.",

I mean sure, he can do Sharingan genjutsus like every Uchiha can, but he really isn't as strong. He uses Kamui, so he likes physical combat, coz he is OP in that.\n\nAnd yes, you're actually right. I mean genjutsu is underrated by many people, while it is just as strong as ninjutsu, if you are good enough with it.

She might have a way easier time fighting off Amaterasu, or Kamui, or tsyukiomi, but I do not think anyone is immune to the genjutsu. Just have easier times with it.

Madara with EMS would be able to resist Itachi most of the time. Long enough to pull out the Perfect Susanoo and destroy the place. And the Otsutsukis are generally OP. I mean they don't give a fuck about anything. In Boruto when one of them attacked the Chuunin exam or what (idk. I never watched it, just saw the fight), Shikamaru catched him with shadow possession and the guy just casually broke out of it.

He started trying after that point, but he was never serious he could kill sasuke any second and he proved that by letting sasuke throw everything he had at him until he had 0 chakra, and only then did Itachi fight back and he still had susanoo.

You need someone or yourself to wake you out of genjutsu, for a fact. That takes time, for a fact. During that time the uchiha just kills you. I can believe that. Itachi stomped orochimaru solo with just a look, obito stomped Kurama solo with just a look, if you aren\u2019t a perfect jin or hashirama who is immune to anything that makes him weaker than anyone else, than you\u2019re kinda screwed against even basic genjutsu. Against uchiha genjutsu you\u2019re gonna die unless you get help. That\u2019s why obito never genjutsu\u2019d minato because it would have been a instant stomp. Genjutsu fell off as the series went on because it\u2019s unbeatable if you\u2019re alone or not a jinjuriki. All madara had to do was genjutsu guy and non of that could have happened because he would have interrupted them until someone could physically get to guy, wake him up, and get him fighting all over again. Jiraiya last ditch survival move was genjutsu because he knew if pain got caught by himself, it\u2019s an instant win for him. Genjutsu is boosted. Genjutsu is a instant win in a one on one fight and you trap the other person. Orochimaru trapped hiruzen in a basic genjutsu and it took the most experienced hokage all his effort to barley make it out. A normal shinobi solo is not defeating a uchiha or a uchiha genjutsu.",

Itachi stomped orochimaru solo with just a look, obito stomped Kurama solo with just a look, if you aren\u2019t a perfect jin or hashirama who is immune to anything that makes him weaker than anyone else, than you\u2019re kinda screwed against even basic genjutsu. Against uchiha genjutsu you\u2019re gonna die unless you get help. That\u2019s why obito never genjutsu\u2019d minato because it would have been a instant stomp. Genjutsu fell off as the series went on because it\u2019s unbeatable if you\u2019re alone or not a jinjuriki. All madara had to do was genjutsu guy and non of that could have happened because he would have interrupted them until someone could physically get to guy, wake him up, and get him fighting all over again. Jiraiya last ditch survival move was genjutsu because he knew if pain got caught by himself, it\u2019s an instant win for him. Genjutsu is boosted. Genjutsu is a instant win in a one on one fight and you trap the other person. Orochimaru trapped hiruzen in a basic genjutsu and it took the most experienced hokage all his effort to barley make it out. A normal shinobi solo is not defeating a uchiha or a uchiha genjutsu.",

You need someone or yourself to wake you out of genjutsu, for a fact. That takes time, for a fact. During that time the uchiha just kills you. I can believe that. Itachi stomped orochimaru solo with just a look, obito stomped Kurama solo with just a look, if you aren\u2019t a perfect jin or hashirama who is immune to anything that makes him weaker than anyone else, than you\u2019re kinda screwed against even basic genjutsu. Against uchiha genjutsu you\u2019re gonna die unless you get help. That\u2019s why obito never genjutsu\u2019d minato because it would have been a instant stomp. Genjutsu fell off as the series went on because it\u2019s unbeatable if you\u2019re alone or not a jinjuriki. All madara had to do was genjutsu guy and non of that could have happened because he would have interrupted them until someone could physically get to guy, wake him up, and get him fighting all over again. Jiraiya last ditch survival move was genjutsu because he knew if pain got caught by himself, it\u2019s an instant win for him. Genjutsu is boosted. Genjutsu is a instant win in a one on one fight and you trap the other person. Orochimaru trapped hiruzen in a basic genjutsu and it took the most experienced hokage all his effort to barley make it out. A normal shinobi solo is not defeating a uchiha or a uchiha genjutsu.",

Where did Sasuke use the Kirin, Itachi the Susanoo? Why Itachi got tired? Not because of genjutsu. He had to drain himself out physically to die in his illness, but also had to look like Sasuke kills him.",

The only question is.....does having a rinnegan or being more godly make you immune? Kaguya was not immune to Amaterasu, was not immune to Kamui, so I can\u2019t just assume she would be immune to another eye jutsu just because she\u2019s a higher level uchiha. She might have a way easier time fighting off Amaterasu, or Kamui, or tsyukiomi, but I do not think anyone is immune to the genjutsu. Just have easier times with it. Sasuke wasn\u2019t even immune to it, he just said he was starting to see through it, as well as see it.",

Long enough to pull out the Perfect Susanoo and destroy the place. And the Otsutsukis are generally OP. I mean they don't give a fuck about anything. In Boruto when one of them attacked the Chuunin exam or what (idk. I never watched it, just saw the fight), Shikamaru catched him with shadow possession and the guy just casually broke out of it. I don't think any Otsutsuki can be genjutsud or at least they can break out of it for sure. Otherwise Sasuke would just genjutsu them with his Rinnegan+Sharingan and would be GG. IMO.",
