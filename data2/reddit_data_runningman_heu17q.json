Like in the extended guest intros that are basically talent shows, So Min will try to participate in every single one. It's an error of excessive eagerness so it's forgivable. Reminds me of Kwang Soo's \"Noooooo!\" yell he used to do as a reaction that he did too much so it was kind of cringe at times.",
