And Sasuke stands there processing this information for a solid 10 seconds because wow okay apparently this curse mark and the power Orochimaru promised him isn't all it's hyped up to be.\n\nSo Kabuto finally arrives to pick Sasuke up because he's taking too long to get to the hideout on his own, and Sasuke turns on him and he's like \"Y O U  L I E D  T O  M E\".\n\nHonestly I just wanted a 3 way battle between the Akatsuki, Orochimaru, and Konoha.",

The Sound Four were wiped out by a group of Genins, give me one valid reason why I should bother joining you.\" And so Orochimaru joins the fight against the Akatsuki in this three way battle--oh and also Sasori's informant from the Village Hidden In The Sand alerted him to the fact that Gaara was headed towards the forests surrounding Konoha to act as support for Naruto's team, so him and Deidara arrived not long after Itachi and Kisame with the intent of capturing Gaara too because come on, two jinchuurikis in the same place? That's way too good of an opportunity to pass up.\n\nShit's getting wild lmao.",

The Sound Four were wiped out by a group of Genins, give me one valid reason why I should bother joining you.\" And so Orochimaru joins the fight against the Akatsuki in this three way battle--oh and also Sasori's informant from the Village Hidden In The Sand alerted him to the fact that Gaara was headed towards the forests surrounding Konoha to act as support for Naruto's team, so him and Deidara arrived not long after Itachi and Kisame with the intent of capturing Gaara too because come on, two jinchuurikis in the same place? That's way too good of an opportunity to pass up.\n\nShit's getting wild lmao.",

The Sound Four were wiped out by a group of Genins, give me one valid reason why I should bother joining you.\" And so Orochimaru joins the fight against the Akatsuki in this three way battle--oh and also Sasori's informant from the Village Hidden In The Sand alerted him to the fact that Gaara was headed towards the forests surrounding Konoha to act as support for Naruto's team, so him and Deidara arrived not long after Itachi and Kisame with the intent of capturing Gaara too because come on, two jinchuurikis in the same place? That's way too good of an opportunity to pass up.\n\nShit's getting wild lmao.",
