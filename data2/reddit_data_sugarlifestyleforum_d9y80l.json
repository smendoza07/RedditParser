    "body": "So kind of an odd question, but here goes:\n\nMy dad is cheap. Or at least, he always dreaded the thought of spoiling me or my sister. This means that instead of driving me (12 years old) to my friend's house, he would instead present to me an equation of how much time amd money it would cost him (20 minutes each way + gas + taxes ++), and how I could just take the bus. I don't mind taking the bus, but similar discussions would pop up everytime there was something i wanted. Keep in mind my father is RICH, and he could make my life so much easier if he wasn't obsessed with always spending the bare minimum.\n\nEnough of the unrelated story/rant. You get my point. After years of being slammed down whenever I asked for something, it became incredibly uncomfortable to do so. I hate it, it gives me anxiety just thinking about it.\n\nNow, I brought up financial expectation with my new POT (over text), and he wanted to discuss my needs next time we meet. \n\nMY NEEDS?! I don't \"need\" his money, I will survive on my student loan and part time job. I don't \"need\" more, but I want more. I want to buy a new couch, I want to buy expensive, organic avocados, and I want to buy new shoes that I will only wear one time.\n\nHow do I discuss this when It's so incredibly painful for me to do so? How much do I ask for? We both agreed we wanted a monthly allowance. I reaaally like this guy, but obviously more is more when it comes to sugar. \n\nI really hope this doesn't come across as \"just another newbie question\", because I've noticed this sub is filling up on them.\n\nAny advice from strangers? Thanks in advance",

            "body": "I can completely relate to this.  I grew up poor and in a very abusive neglectful home.  Anytime I would ask for things it was met with verbal or physical abuse so I completely understand shutting down.  It has taken me a lot of therapy and hard work to get better but the bowl has actually helped me.  It\u2019s about letting go and being vulnerable to talk about those things.  If you think doing it over text or phone would be easier for you, do that, don\u2019t feel like you have to do it in person(I get a little akward about it and I am a super confident woman). \n\nRemember, not every man is your dad.  You are going to meet some shitty mean in the bowl, use your experience with your dad to not tolerate that treatment.  Instead find someone who cares about you and wants to do those things for you.  When you do, it can be amazing and can help heal some old wounds too.  Good luck, I hope he is a good guy and it works out",

And I'm happy to hear you've fought through a lot of this.\n\nWhat worries me is that some (most) SDs wants to spend as little as possible in allowance. I think it's naive to believe that they actually LIKE to just give me stuff, based of what I've read in here...\n\nI don't know what I'm scared of.

For me I've done both, see what the minimum I can get away with and go with that--while others send a random Venmo amount without having it brought up.\n\nI can't tell you the exact reasoning behind it but the less needy a girl seems the more I'm willing to give but if they make it clear I'm just an ATM then I'm less enthused to do so.",

I have a job (parents, school loans, whatever) and I don\u2019t need a lot. This is really about having somebody to do fun things with and having some extra money to enjoy. Now as to what I enjoy, there\u2019s so many things and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll discuss many of them over time but many of the normal things people value - travel, nice food, I\u2019d love to upgrade my apt etc. and I wouldn\u2019t mind taking fewer student loans (taking less from parents, working fewer hours) along the way. I\u2019m looking for somebody to help with that. I\u2019m not extravagant but if you\u2019re willing to help with those things I\u2019m interested in hearing what you\u2019re willing to do\u201d.",

First, ask in text or on the phone what ballpark allowance the gent was thinking about and how that might be split into PPMs (the most common method, especially early).  If he is in your ballpark, move forward and convey your interest and your personal positives clearly.  It is super important to be clear what you should expect and for you to be comfortable with the core arrangement before moving forward.  \n\nSecond, my best partner would mention from time to time a financial challenge without asking for help.  For example, \"American higher education seems crazy to me.  Why should I need to pay $90 to submit the thesis expected for the degree I am already enrolled in (blah, blah).\"  She covered ubers to our initial dates, never said a word, and I found out organically.  I covered these costs and she was honestly appreciative.  This great partner (hi Writer Girl!) was raised by less frugal parents than you (the bus thing is crazy).  Still, she is personally very frugal.  I think Writer Girl understood, intuitively, that I literally gave her all I could without messing with my general situation over the last 6-8 weeks of our arrangement.  That was the point where she knew she had not gotten into a PhD program and would need to move away.  \n\nAnyway, with a good SD, this combination of insisting you be clear on the basic allowance and then appreciation for any gifts beyond that might serve you well.  PM if this is not clear or you have a follow on question.",

Instead of thinking about what the SD costs are (like you did with your dad when he was teaching you) to thinking about what your costs are and what you need to receive to get value for what you are offering.\n\nWith this way of thinking, instead of the experience being painful as the one asking, you should be empowered by the experience as the one judging if the amount offered to you is enough (with your costs for travel, clothing, makeup, time etc). Your dad would want you to grow to be the one giving the lesson in value.\n\nAll this may not change how much are requiring as an allowance but it should make you more comfortable with why the amount is reasonable. If you want to give anything extra to your SD, give quality.  He'll remember that for a lot longer than a discount.",

But $50/hr to provide companionship, intimacy, and discretion, is honestly beyond insulting. So let\u2019s bump it up to $100 which to me still is a slightly insulting hourly rate for someone holding your secrets and in most cases letting you decide the sexual energy and stick your dick in someone less than half your age. That\u2019s now $400 for 4 hours which is about the average non-sleepover date that I prefer based on my experience. $400 for 4 hours of work and 24/7 secret keeping is pretty low IMO.

What's the value of being able to sound out how to explain to your parents you decided not to go to medical school?\n\nThat doesn't mean I don't expect to provide an allowance that allows someone to graduate from college debt-free.\n\nAnd the focus on secret keeping is frankly a little concerning. No matter how we meet someone we date, isn't it expected to keep each other secrets. Of course women I date, whether from SA or through traditional dating, tell me information that is intimate, personal, and secret. The thousands of years it's been built into us that we keep that information personal and secret even when we grow apart.",

If you had connections to those grad schools or could give me an internship, then that would be fulfilling the SUGAR part. But there's so many other resources out there to help sort through grad school and internships. Unless the Daddy works in those fields, then his advice is going to be no better or worse than any one else I can get help from. Also, I don't go into sugaring for someone who can help me decide on grad schools...... \n\nI also have many people in my life i can trust and whom care for me, so that's not why I enter sugar relationships. I enter sugar relationships for sugar and to be pounded by an older man because I'm a sexual deviant. The support, etc is part of the \"emotional connection\" that I seek in SR's and the SDs I want to be with also want this connection. That's part of the deal, but I can also get that from literally anyone else without the SUGAR tag. The point of an SR is to provide sugar, get honey. \n\n\"What's the value... new tires\" so that's back to money, you're just proving my point.\n\n\"What's the value... when your vanilla boyfriend hits you?\" whoaaaa if you're in an abusive relationship, an SR is not going to make your life any better and being able to talk to an older gentleman about the abuse you endure is NOT going to help. Only leaving the relationship will help - I know this from personal experience.\n\n\"what's the value... not going to medical school?\" dude do you just assume all sugar babies DONT have any friends? These are all things I can get from a bestie or... you know... my parents. Which, sure, not all SBs have friends or parents, but the things you've listed all sound like very generic conversations that are not particularly exclusive to a sugar daddy. I can get them from friends, parents, college advisors, etc. I personally don't look for SRs for things like help deciding grad school.\n\nWE all have our reasons for getting into sugar relationships, mine are not for generic advice I can get from friends, parents, or college advisers and therefore I see no value in that beyond what is normally expected in a relationship.\n\nWhat is NOT normally expected in a relationship is to keep their secret, work your schedule around theirs, let them lead the sexual energy, ensure discretion,sneak around/frick in a hotel, and do your best to not let their wives find out.",

By and large, I think there is a fairly limited number of men able to afford the type of allowances you are talking.\n\nIt's hard to have these discussions without violating rule number 4.  But yes, some women will have no problem getting these allowances repeatedly - from one arrangement to the next.  But, just like it's the top 5% of the SDs that can offer it, it's the \"top\" (not going to define what that means) 5% of SBs that can get it.\n\nAnd location is going to have a huge impact.

I have a job (parents, school loans, whatever) and I don\u2019t need a lot. This is really about having somebody to do fun things with and having some extra money to enjoy. Now as to what I enjoy, there\u2019s so many things and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll discuss many of them over time but many of the normal things people value - travel, nice food, I\u2019d love to upgrade my apt etc. and I wouldn\u2019t mind taking fewer student loans (taking less from parents, working fewer hours) along the way. I\u2019m looking for somebody to help with that. I\u2019m not extravagant but if you\u2019re willing to help with those things I\u2019m interested in hearing what you\u2019re willing to do\u201d.",

The \u201cI hate taking about money\u201d means you are not going to haggle.   Acting like you are giving something (not getting money if you cancel or reschedule, duh) before setting a firm expectation if the other side makes a change.    Tying those changes to hurting you.   If they push back against you they look unreasonable and somewhat cruel.  That\u2019s all tactical empathy.",

But $50/hr to provide companionship, intimacy, and discretion, is honestly beyond insulting. So let\u2019s bump it up to $100 which to me still is a slightly insulting hourly rate for someone holding your secrets and in most cases letting you decide the sexual energy and stick your dick in someone less than half your age. That\u2019s now $400 for 4 hours which is about the average non-sleepover date that I prefer based on my experience. $400 for 4 hours of work and 24/7 secret keeping is pretty low IMO. But again that should be pennies to a real sugar daddy. What\u2019s the phrase? If you have to ask the price you can\u2019t afford it.",

What's the value of having a guy in your life you trust and can provide a sounding board to your decisions? What's the value in knowing if your car fails inspection because of brakes or tires, your car will magically appear with new tires?  What's the value of having a guy you can talk to when your vanilla boyfriend hits you?

No matter how we meet someone we date, isn't it expected to keep each other secrets. Of course women I date, whether from SA or through traditional dating, tell me information that is intimate, personal, and secret. The thousands of years it's been built into us that we keep that information personal and secret even when we grow apart.",

If you had connections to those grad schools or could give me an internship, then that would be fulfilling the SUGAR part. But there's so many other resources out there to help sort through grad school and internships. Unless the Daddy works in those fields, then his advice is going to be no better or worse than any one else I can get help from. Also, I don't go into sugaring for someone who can help me decide on grad schools...... \n\nI also have many people in my life i can trust and whom care for me, so that's not why I enter sugar relationships. I enter sugar relationships for sugar and to be pounded by an older man because I'm a sexual deviant. The support, etc is part of the \"emotional connection\" that I seek in SR's and the SDs I want to be with also want this connection. That's part of the deal, but I can also get that from literally anyone else without the SUGAR tag. The point of an SR is to provide sugar, get honey. \n\n\"What's the value... new tires\" so that's back to money, you're just proving my point.\n\n\"What's the value... when your vanilla boyfriend hits you?\" whoaaaa if you're in an abusive relationship, an SR is not going to make your life any better and being able to talk to an older gentleman about the abuse you endure is NOT going to help. Only leaving the relationship will help - I know this from personal experience.\n\n\"what's the value... not going to medical school?\" dude do you just assume all sugar babies DONT have any friends? These are all things I can get from a bestie or... you know... my parents. Which, sure, not all SBs have friends or parents, but the things you've listed all sound like very generic conversations that are not particularly exclusive to a sugar daddy. I can get them from friends, parents, college advisors, etc. I personally don't look for SRs for things like help deciding grad school.\n\nWE all have our reasons for getting into sugar relationships, mine are not for generic advice I can get from friends, parents, or college advisers and therefore I see no value in that beyond what is normally expected in a relationship.\n\nWhat is NOT normally expected in a relationship is to keep their secret, work your schedule around theirs, let them lead the sexual energy, ensure discretion,sneak around/frick in a hotel, and do your best to not let their wives find out.",

So if You require 4 hours of work that\u2019s at minimum $200 for 4 hours, which might be more what you\u2019re thinking... and that\u2019s just for design work which doesn\u2019t include secrecy usually. But $50/hr to provide companionship, intimacy, and discretion, is honestly beyond insulting. So let\u2019s bump it up to $100 which to me still is a slightly insulting hourly rate for someone holding your secrets and in most cases letting you decide the sexual energy and stick your dick in someone less than half your age. That\u2019s now $400 for 4 hours which is about the average non-sleepover date that I prefer based on my experience. $400 for 4 hours of work and 24/7 secret keeping is pretty low IMO. But again that should be pennies to a real sugar daddy. What\u2019s the phrase? If you have to ask the price you can\u2019t afford it.",

What's the value of having a guy in your life you trust and can provide a sounding board to your decisions?

What's the value of having a guy you can talk to when your vanilla boyfriend hits you?

No matter how we meet someone we date, isn't it expected to keep each other secrets. Of course women I date, whether from SA or through traditional dating, tell me information that is intimate, personal, and secret. The thousands of years it's been built into us that we keep that information personal and secret even when we grow apart.",

If you had connections to those grad schools or could give me an internship, then that would be fulfilling the SUGAR part. But there's so many other resources out there to help sort through grad school and internships. Unless the Daddy works in those fields, then his advice is going to be no better or worse than any one else I can get help from. Also, I don't go into sugaring for someone who can help me decide on grad schools...... \n\nI also have many people in my life i can trust and whom care for me, so that's not why I enter sugar relationships. I enter sugar relationships for sugar and to be pounded by an older man because I'm a sexual deviant. The support, etc is part of the \"emotional connection\" that I seek in SR's and the SDs I want to be with also want this connection. That's part of the deal, but I can also get that from literally anyone else without the SUGAR tag. The point of an SR is to provide sugar, get honey. \n\n\"What's the value... new tires\" so that's back to money, you're just proving my point.\n\n\"What's the value... when your vanilla boyfriend hits you?\" whoaaaa if you're in an abusive relationship, an SR is not going to make your life any better and being able to talk to an older gentleman about the abuse you endure is NOT going to help. Only leaving the relationship will help - I know this from personal experience.\n\n\"what's the value... not going to medical school?\" dude do you just assume all sugar babies DONT have any friends? These are all things I can get from a bestie or... you know... my parents. Which, sure, not all SBs have friends or parents, but the things you've listed all sound like very generic conversations that are not particularly exclusive to a sugar daddy. I can get them from friends, parents, college advisors, etc. I personally don't look for SRs for things like help deciding grad school.\n\nWE all have our reasons for getting into sugar relationships, mine are not for generic advice I can get from friends, parents, or college advisers and therefore I see no value in that beyond what is normally expected in a relationship.\n\nWhat is NOT normally expected in a relationship is to keep their secret, work your schedule around theirs, let them lead the sexual energy, ensure discretion,sneak around/frick in a hotel, and do your best to not let their wives find out.",

So if You require 4 hours of work that\u2019s at minimum $200 for 4 hours, which might be more what you\u2019re thinking... and that\u2019s just for design work which doesn\u2019t include secrecy usually. But $50/hr to provide companionship, intimacy, and discretion, is honestly beyond insulting. So let\u2019s bump it up to $100 which to me still is a slightly insulting hourly rate for someone holding your secrets and in most cases letting you decide the sexual energy and stick your dick in someone less than half your age. That\u2019s now $400 for 4 hours which is about the average non-sleepover date that I prefer based on my experience. $400 for 4 hours of work and 24/7 secret keeping is pretty low IMO. But again that should be pennies to a real sugar daddy. What\u2019s the phrase? If you have to ask the price you can\u2019t afford it.",

What's the value in having someone in your life who cares about you and helps you sort through internships or grad school options? What's the value of having a guy in your life you trust and can provide a sounding board to your decisions? What's the value in knowing if your car fails inspection because of brakes or tires, your car will magically appear with new tires?  What's the value of having a guy you can talk to when your vanilla boyfriend hits you? What's the value of being able to sound out how to explain to your parents you decided not to go to medical school?\n\nThat doesn't mean I don't expect to provide an allowance that allows someone to graduate from college debt-free.\n\nAnd the focus on secret keeping is frankly a little concerning. No matter how we meet someone we date, isn't it expected to keep each other secrets. Of course women I date, whether from SA or through traditional dating, tell me information that is intimate, personal, and secret. The thousands of years it's been built into us that we keep that information personal and secret even when we grow apart.",

If you had connections to those grad schools or could give me an internship, then that would be fulfilling the SUGAR part. But there's so many other resources out there to help sort through grad school and internships. Unless the Daddy works in those fields, then his advice is going to be no better or worse than any one else I can get help from. Also, I don't go into sugaring for someone who can help me decide on grad schools...... \n\nI also have many people in my life i can trust and whom care for me, so that's not why I enter sugar relationships. I enter sugar relationships for sugar and to be pounded by an older man because I'm a sexual deviant. The support, etc is part of the \"emotional connection\" that I seek in SR's and the SDs I want to be with also want this connection. That's part of the deal, but I can also get that from literally anyone else without the SUGAR tag. The point of an SR is to provide sugar, get honey. \n\n\"What's the value... new tires\" so that's back to money, you're just proving my point.\n\n\"What's the value... when your vanilla boyfriend hits you?\" whoaaaa if you're in an abusive relationship, an SR is not going to make your life any better and being able to talk to an older gentleman about the abuse you endure is NOT going to help. Only leaving the relationship will help - I know this from personal experience.\n\n\"what's the value... not going to medical school?\" dude do you just assume all sugar babies DONT have any friends? These are all things I can get from a bestie or... you know... my parents. Which, sure, not all SBs have friends or parents, but the things you've listed all sound like very generic conversations that are not particularly exclusive to a sugar daddy. I can get them from friends, parents, college advisors, etc. I personally don't look for SRs for things like help deciding grad school.\n\nWE all have our reasons for getting into sugar relationships, mine are not for generic advice I can get from friends, parents, or college advisers and therefore I see no value in that beyond what is normally expected in a relationship.\n\nWhat is NOT normally expected in a relationship is to keep their secret, work your schedule around theirs, let them lead the sexual energy, ensure discretion,sneak around/frick in a hotel, and do your best to not let their wives find out.",

So if You require 4 hours of work that\u2019s at minimum $200 for 4 hours, which might be more what you\u2019re thinking... and that\u2019s just for design work which doesn\u2019t include secrecy usually. But $50/hr to provide companionship, intimacy, and discretion, is honestly beyond insulting. So let\u2019s bump it up to $100 which to me still is a slightly insulting hourly rate for someone holding your secrets and in most cases letting you decide the sexual energy and stick your dick in someone less than half your age. That\u2019s now $400 for 4 hours which is about the average non-sleepover date that I prefer based on my experience. $400 for 4 hours of work and 24/7 secret keeping is pretty low IMO. But again that should be pennies to a real sugar daddy. What\u2019s the phrase? If you have to ask the price you can\u2019t afford it.",

What's the value in having someone in your life who cares about you and helps you sort through internships or grad school options? What's the value of having a guy in your life you trust and can provide a sounding board to your decisions? What's the value in knowing if your car fails inspection because of brakes or tires, your car will magically appear with new tires?  What's the value of having a guy you can talk to when your vanilla boyfriend hits you? What's the value of being able to sound out how to explain to your parents you decided not to go to medical school?\n\nThat doesn't mean I don't expect to provide an allowance that allows someone to graduate from college debt-free.\n\nAnd the focus on secret keeping is frankly a little concerning. No matter how we meet someone we date, isn't it expected to keep each other secrets. Of course women I date, whether from SA or through traditional dating, tell me information that is intimate, personal, and secret. The thousands of years it's been built into us that we keep that information personal and secret even when we grow apart.",

If you had connections to those grad schools or could give me an internship, then that would be fulfilling the SUGAR part. But there's so many other resources out there to help sort through grad school and internships. Unless the Daddy works in those fields, then his advice is going to be no better or worse than any one else I can get help from. Also, I don't go into sugaring for someone who can help me decide on grad schools...... \n\nI also have many people in my life i can trust and whom care for me, so that's not why I enter sugar relationships. I enter sugar relationships for sugar and to be pounded by an older man because I'm a sexual deviant. The support, etc is part of the \"emotional connection\" that I seek in SR's and the SDs I want to be with also want this connection. That's part of the deal, but I can also get that from literally anyone else without the SUGAR tag. The point of an SR is to provide sugar, get honey. \n\n\"What's the value... new tires\" so that's back to money, you're just proving my point.\n\n\"What's the value... when your vanilla boyfriend hits you?\" whoaaaa if you're in an abusive relationship, an SR is not going to make your life any better and being able to talk to an older gentleman about the abuse you endure is NOT going to help. Only leaving the relationship will help - I know this from personal experience.\n\n\"what's the value... not going to medical school?\" dude do you just assume all sugar babies DONT have any friends? These are all things I can get from a bestie or... you know... my parents. Which, sure, not all SBs have friends or parents, but the things you've listed all sound like very generic conversations that are not particularly exclusive to a sugar daddy. I can get them from friends, parents, college advisors, etc. I personally don't look for SRs for things like help deciding grad school.\n\nWE all have our reasons for getting into sugar relationships, mine are not for generic advice I can get from friends, parents, or college advisers and therefore I see no value in that beyond what is normally expected in a relationship.\n\nWhat is NOT normally expected in a relationship is to keep their secret, work your schedule around theirs, let them lead the sexual energy, ensure discretion,sneak around/frick in a hotel, and do your best to not let their wives find out.",

What's the value of having a guy in your life you trust and can provide a sounding board to your decisions?

No matter how we meet someone we date, isn't it expected to keep each other secrets. Of course women I date, whether from SA or through traditional dating, tell me information that is intimate, personal, and secret. The thousands of years it's been built into us that we keep that information personal and secret even when we grow apart.",

But there's so many other resources out there to help sort through grad school and internships. Unless the Daddy works in those fields, then his advice is going to be no better or worse than any one else I can get help from. Also, I don't go into sugaring for someone who can help me decide on grad schools...... \n\nI also have many people in my life i can trust and whom care for me, so that's not why I enter sugar relationships. I enter sugar relationships for sugar and to be pounded by an older man because I'm a sexual deviant. The support, etc is part of the \"emotional connection\" that I seek in SR's and the SDs I want to be with also want this connection. That's part of the deal, but I can also get that from literally anyone else without the SUGAR tag. The point of an SR is to provide sugar, get honey. \n\n\"What's the value... new tires\" so that's back to money, you're just proving my point.\n\n\"What's the value... when your vanilla boyfriend hits you?\" whoaaaa if you're in an abusive relationship, an SR is not going to make your life any better and being able to talk to an older gentleman about the abuse you endure is NOT going to help. Only leaving the relationship will help - I know this from personal experience.\n\n\"what's the value... not going to medical school?\" dude do you just assume all sugar babies DONT have any friends? These are all things I can get from a bestie or... you know... my parents. Which, sure, not all SBs have friends or parents, but the things you've listed all sound like very generic conversations that are not particularly exclusive to a sugar daddy. I can get them from friends, parents, college advisors, etc. I personally don't look for SRs for things like help deciding grad school.\n\nWE all have our reasons for getting into sugar relationships, mine are not for generic advice I can get from friends, parents, or college advisers and therefore I see no value in that beyond what is normally expected in a relationship.\n\nWhat is NOT normally expected in a relationship is to keep their secret, work your schedule around theirs, let them lead the sexual energy, ensure discretion,sneak around/frick in a hotel, and do your best to not let their wives find out.",

If you had connections to those grad schools or could give me an internship, then that would be fulfilling the SUGAR part. But there's so many other resources out there to help sort through grad school and internships. Unless the Daddy works in those fields, then his advice is going to be no better or worse than any one else I can get help from. Also, I don't go into sugaring for someone who can help me decide on grad schools...... \n\nI also have many people in my life i can trust and whom care for me, so that's not why I enter sugar relationships. I enter sugar relationships for sugar and to be pounded by an older man because I'm a sexual deviant. The support, etc is part of the \"emotional connection\" that I seek in SR's and the SDs I want to be with also want this connection. That's part of the deal, but I can also get that from literally anyone else without the SUGAR tag. The point of an SR is to provide sugar, get honey. \n\n\"What's the value... new tires\" so that's back to money, you're just proving my point.\n\n\"What's the value... when your vanilla boyfriend hits you?\" whoaaaa if you're in an abusive relationship, an SR is not going to make your life any better and being able to talk to an older gentleman about the abuse you endure is NOT going to help. Only leaving the relationship will help - I know this from personal experience.\n\n\"what's the value... not going to medical school?\" dude do you just assume all sugar babies DONT have any friends? These are all things I can get from a bestie or... you know... my parents. Which, sure, not all SBs have friends or parents, but the things you've listed all sound like very generic conversations that are not particularly exclusive to a sugar daddy. I can get them from friends, parents, college advisors, etc. I personally don't look for SRs for things like help deciding grad school.\n\nWE all have our reasons for getting into sugar relationships, mine are not for generic advice I can get from friends, parents, or college advisers and therefore I see no value in that beyond what is normally expected in a relationship.\n\nWhat is NOT normally expected in a relationship is to keep their secret, work your schedule around theirs, let them lead the sexual energy, ensure discretion,sneak around/frick in a hotel, and do your best to not let their wives find out.",
