SasuSaku is second place for Sasuke and NaruHina is second place for Naruto.\n\nNaruSaku is a bit more popular than SasuHina though in fan fics but they're closer to the same level nowadays. Most of the NaruSaku fandom got absorbed by the SasuSaku fandom and they're now SS shippers now.\n\n>Also, why is SasuSaku so popular? Its such a toxic and poorly developed ship imo.\n\nI mean all the canon ships in Naruto are like that. Temari hits Shikamaru, Ino has tried to get into a fist fight with Sai and Sai thought Ino was ugly, Sakura used to beat Naruto's ass constantly and verbally abuse him,  Sasuke & Sakura tried to kill each other and Naruto neglects Hinata when they're married & they barely interacted with each other in the manga\n\nThat said, Sasuke & Sakura look hot together, they have the most development out of the canon ships no matter how poorly written that is and they have the all-loving girl x bad boy dynamic that fans love. That's why SasuSaku is the most popular hetero ship in Naruto",

None of those people were alive for particularly long, certainly nowhere near as long as Madara. Danzo didn't have all those sharingan or the Hashirama cells until he was already a fairly old man (we know this thanks to the helpful note that he was assisted by Orochimaru who is much younger and was already a fugitive having left the village when Danzo collaborated with him, and also that his sharingan are from the Uchiha massacre not prior). So he probably wouldn't have manifested rinnegan anyways before dying of old age. Not to mention that his sharingan were all normal 3 tomoe with the exception of Shisui's. That may also play a part. Perhaps one needs to be fully advanced to the mangekyo in order to get the rinnegan; after all the rinnegan is called the final progression of the sharingan by multiple people. That would also explain Obito (besides the time thing) since he didn't have the eternal mangekyo. Same goes for Shin and his clones, not only do they not have eternal mangekyo, they don't even have normal sharingan. Their eyes are somewhat different. \n\nAgain, this is all speculative but there's precedent for it so I wouldn't be surprised if it were the case.",

And he was only able to summon it after his rinnegan developed. It looked like he and Hashirama were maybe in their 30s or 40s at the final battle? *Maybe* 50s. So it didn't really take him that long in comparison to develop rinnegan. \n\nGood point about it maybe requiring EMS first though.",

What did Madara do during the down period of time after the battle? When he only had one working sharingan, and was still young and healthy enough to be one of the most dominant forces on the planet even with that handicap",

The only way this could ever happen is if, for example, Sarada and Boruto (who carry the bloodlines) have children, and one of their descendants just happens to be the reincarnation of both Ashura and Indra at the same time. Only then is when a person would get a natural Rinnegan. But such a thing is very unlikely to happen at all, as they would most certainly be reincarnated in different people.",

How she grew up with naruto and Sasuke and did this to her child is beyond me.",

Even her backstory about meeting Sasuke in the exams was... Weird. Like, not everyone needs to be related or have some background with each other. \n\nI don't dislike Karin, I just think it cheapens her character.\n\nWhat makes her character work enough is that Karin is, essentially, Naruto + Sakura. You can show that Sasuke is still attached to his old team by making his new team similar. Each person reminding Sasuke of Team 7 is poetic. Karin is Sakura/Naruto, Suigetsu is Naruto/Sasuke (loud mouth but very capable), and Jugo is Kakashi/Naruto (calm and powerful... but with a \"monster\" inside when angered). Making them mirror Team 7 more would have done so much more than throwing out Karin is an Uzumaki and got saved by Sasuke (which, doesn't feel like it adds up).",

But there\u2019s a big possibility that you and I share the same distant relative. Fun fact,a lot of people are in some way related to Gengis Kahn, because he boned like EVERYONE he conquered or encountered, then those people spread out and meet Europeans and so on.\n\n Same with uchiha, I don\u2019t think Izumi and Itachi are related. They just both have the same very distant ancestor. Though it is possible with the aristocratic uchiha, cus in real life, ancient aristocrats did commit incest sometimes for \u201cpure bloodline\u201d stuff. \n\nRegardless, Karin and Naruto are a bad ship XD funny though. Could be an interesting read.",

SasuSaku is second place for Sasuke and NaruHina is second place for Naruto.\n\nNaruSaku is a bit more popular than SasuHina though in fan fics but they're closer to the same level nowadays. Most of the NaruSaku fandom got absorbed by the SasuSaku fandom and they're now SS shippers now.\n\n>Also, why is SasuSaku so popular? Its such a toxic and poorly developed ship imo.\n\nI mean all the canon ships in Naruto are like that. Temari hits Shikamaru, Ino has tried to get into a fist fight with Sai and Sai thought Ino was ugly, Sakura used to beat Naruto's ass constantly and verbally abuse him,  Sasuke & Sakura tried to kill each other and Naruto neglects Hinata when they're married & they barely interacted with each other in the manga\n\nThat said, Sasuke & Sakura look hot together, they have the most development out of the canon ships no matter how poorly written that is and they have the all-loving girl x bad boy dynamic that fans love. That's why SasuSaku is the most popular hetero ship in Naruto",

Even in Obito's case, he did have Senju chakra but he didn't live particularly long so it's perfectly possible it just would've awakened at a later date. No one in the manga said that Madara was outright wrong, and that Senju - Uchiha chakra doesn't awaken the rinnegan. They simply say that that isn't the reason Madara's rinnegan specifically awakened.\n\nI dunno, it's a bit speculative but there's plenty of precedent for it. Could be wrong.",

None of those people were alive for particularly long, certainly nowhere near as long as Madara. Danzo didn't have all those sharingan or the Hashirama cells until he was already a fairly old man (we know this thanks to the helpful note that he was assisted by Orochimaru who is much younger and was already a fugitive having left the village when Danzo collaborated with him, and also that his sharingan are from the Uchiha massacre not prior). So he probably wouldn't have manifested rinnegan anyways before dying of old age. Not to mention that his sharingan were all normal 3 tomoe with the exception of Shisui's. That may also play a part. Perhaps one needs to be fully advanced to the mangekyo in order to get the rinnegan; after all the rinnegan is called the final progression of the sharingan by multiple people. That would also explain Obito (besides the time thing) since he didn't have the eternal mangekyo. Same goes for Shin and his clones, not only do they not have eternal mangekyo, they don't even have normal sharingan. Their eyes are somewhat different. \n\nAgain, this is all speculative but there's precedent for it so I wouldn't be surprised if it were the case.",

No random Uchiha or Senju/Uzumaki could ever awaken the Rinnegan, not even by procreating with each other. The only way this could ever happen is if, for example, Sarada and Boruto (who carry the bloodlines) have children, and one of their descendants just happens to be the reincarnation of both Ashura and Indra at the same time. Only then is when a person would get a natural Rinnegan. But such a thing is very unlikely to happen at all, as they would most certainly be reincarnated in different people.",

Kakashi is support and Sakura is Healer. \n\nIf you fall out of formation then that can cost you the match, her role is extremely vital. It\u2019s implied after every injury she\u2019s the one who heals them, which is why they could go from fight to fight because Sakura heals them in between or provides supplements. But if they keep showing that people gonna say oh wow she\u2019s nothing but a medical nin. \n\nI hope you understand my point, and no disrespect to you, the character, author, or show.",

Even her backstory about meeting Sasuke in the exams was... Weird. Like, not everyone needs to be related or have some background with each other. \n\nI don't dislike Karin, I just think it cheapens her character.\n\nWhat makes her character work enough is that Karin is, essentially, Naruto + Sakura. You can show that Sasuke is still attached to his old team by making his new team similar. Each person reminding Sasuke of Team 7 is poetic. Karin is Sakura/Naruto, Suigetsu is Naruto/Sasuke (loud mouth but very capable), and Jugo is Kakashi/Naruto (calm and powerful... but with a \"monster\" inside when angered). Making them mirror Team 7 more would have done so much more than throwing out Karin is an Uzumaki and got saved by Sasuke (which, doesn't feel like it adds up).",

NaruHina would have been a really good ship had it been developed right after the Pain Arc. The way Hinata's confession was completely ignored in the story was infuriating. SasuSaku on the other hand should never have happened after Sasuke almost killed her.",

SasuSaku is second place for Sasuke and NaruHina is second place for Naruto.\n\nNaruSaku is a bit more popular than SasuHina though in fan fics but they're closer to the same level nowadays. Most of the NaruSaku fandom got absorbed by the SasuSaku fandom and they're now SS shippers now.\n\n>Also, why is SasuSaku so popular? Its such a toxic and poorly developed ship imo.\n\nI mean all the canon ships in Naruto are like that. Temari hits Shikamaru, Ino has tried to get into a fist fight with Sai and Sai thought Ino was ugly, Sakura used to beat Naruto's ass constantly and verbally abuse him,  Sasuke & Sakura tried to kill each other and Naruto neglects Hinata when they're married & they barely interacted with each other in the manga\n\nThat said, Sasuke & Sakura look hot together, they have the most development out of the canon ships no matter how poorly written that is and they have the all-loving girl x bad boy dynamic that fans love. That's why SasuSaku is the most popular hetero ship in Naruto",

In chapter 606 Madara says that you cannot awaken the rinnegan without the chakra of the Senju and the Uchiha as one, during his explanation to Obito.

No other Uchiha had the knowledge, the incentive, the power, or the opportunity to attempt getting Senju chakra to try the same thing. Even in Obito's case, he did have Senju chakra but he didn't live particularly long so it's perfectly possible it just would've awakened at a later date. No one in the manga said that Madara was outright wrong, and that Senju - Uchiha chakra doesn't awaken the rinnegan. They simply say that that isn't the reason Madara's rinnegan specifically awakened.\n\nI dunno, it's a bit speculative but there's plenty of precedent for it. Could be wrong.",

None of those people were alive for particularly long, certainly nowhere near as long as Madara. Danzo didn't have all those sharingan or the Hashirama cells until he was already a fairly old man (we know this thanks to the helpful note that he was assisted by Orochimaru who is much younger and was already a fugitive having left the village when Danzo collaborated with him, and also that his sharingan are from the Uchiha massacre not prior). So he probably wouldn't have manifested rinnegan anyways before dying of old age. Not to mention that his sharingan were all normal 3 tomoe with the exception of Shisui's. That may also play a part. Perhaps one needs to be fully advanced to the mangekyo in order to get the rinnegan; after all the rinnegan is called the final progression of the sharingan by multiple people. That would also explain Obito (besides the time thing) since he didn't have the eternal mangekyo. Same goes for Shin and his clones, not only do they not have eternal mangekyo, they don't even have normal sharingan. Their eyes are somewhat different. \n\nAgain, this is all speculative but there's precedent for it so I wouldn't be surprised if it were the case.",

No random Uchiha or Senju/Uzumaki could ever awaken the Rinnegan, not even by procreating with each other. The only way this could ever happen is if, for example, Sarada and Boruto (who carry the bloodlines) have children, and one of their descendants just happens to be the reincarnation of both Ashura and Indra at the same time. Only then is when a person would get a natural Rinnegan. But such a thing is very unlikely to happen at all, as they would most certainly be reincarnated in different people.",

Kishimoto did her really dirty. I was seriously starting to like her as a character after finishing the Kazekage Rescue Arc but she became my least favorite character in the series by the end of Shippuden. I still dont hate her but god it was really annoying to see just cry and beg in front of Sasuke. She was strong in Shippuden in terms of physical strength and abilities but in terms of mental strength she was still the same old Sakura.",

I understood everything she had done and the reasoning why, simply Because I\u2019ve had my heart broken before and also found the love of my life and was completely nervous when meeting up with her. And I\u2019m a man. Lol. But I understand you wanting more involvement with her character. I\u2019m just glad she had some big roles in the fight against Kaguya, it was great seeing all of team 7 in their final battle of shippuden.",

SasuSaku is second place for Sasuke and NaruHina is second place for Naruto.\n\nNaruSaku is a bit more popular than SasuHina though in fan fics but they're closer to the same level nowadays. Most of the NaruSaku fandom got absorbed by the SasuSaku fandom and they're now SS shippers now.\n\n>Also, why is SasuSaku so popular? Its such a toxic and poorly developed ship imo.\n\nI mean all the canon ships in Naruto are like that. Temari hits Shikamaru, Ino has tried to get into a fist fight with Sai and Sai thought Ino was ugly, Sakura used to beat Naruto's ass constantly and verbally abuse him,  Sasuke & Sakura tried to kill each other and Naruto neglects Hinata when they're married & they barely interacted with each other in the manga\n\nThat said, Sasuke & Sakura look hot together, they have the most development out of the canon ships no matter how poorly written that is and they have the all-loving girl x bad boy dynamic that fans love. That's why SasuSaku is the most popular hetero ship in Naruto",

Even in Obito's case, he did have Senju chakra but he didn't live particularly long so it's perfectly possible it just would've awakened at a later date. No one in the manga said that Madara was outright wrong, and that Senju - Uchiha chakra doesn't awaken the rinnegan.

None of those people were alive for particularly long, certainly nowhere near as long as Madara. Danzo didn't have all those sharingan or the Hashirama cells until he was already a fairly old man (we know this thanks to the helpful note that he was assisted by Orochimaru who is much younger and was already a fugitive having left the village when Danzo collaborated with him, and also that his sharingan are from the Uchiha massacre not prior). So he probably wouldn't have manifested rinnegan anyways before dying of old age. Not to mention that his sharingan were all normal 3 tomoe with the exception of Shisui's. That may also play a part. Perhaps one needs to be fully advanced to the mangekyo in order to get the rinnegan; after all the rinnegan is called the final progression of the sharingan by multiple people. That would also explain Obito (besides the time thing) since he didn't have the eternal mangekyo. Same goes for Shin and his clones, not only do they not have eternal mangekyo, they don't even have normal sharingan. Their eyes are somewhat different. \n\nAgain, this is all speculative but there's precedent for it so I wouldn't be surprised if it were the case.",

And he was only able to summon it after his rinnegan developed. It looked like he and Hashirama were maybe in their 30s or 40s at the final battle? *Maybe* 50s. So it didn't really take him that long in comparison to develop rinnegan. \n\nGood point about it maybe requiring EMS first though.",

No random Uchiha or Senju/Uzumaki could ever awaken the Rinnegan, not even by procreating with each other. The only way this could ever happen is if, for example, Sarada and Boruto (who carry the bloodlines) have children, and one of their descendants just happens to be the reincarnation of both Ashura and Indra at the same time. Only then is when a person would get a natural Rinnegan. But such a thing is very unlikely to happen at all, as they would most certainly be reincarnated in different people.",

Kishimoto did her really dirty. I was seriously starting to like her as a character after finishing the Kazekage Rescue Arc but she became my least favorite character in the series by the end of Shippuden. I still dont hate her but god it was really annoying to see just cry and beg in front of Sasuke. She was strong in Shippuden in terms of physical strength and abilities but in terms of mental strength she was still the same old Sakura.",

She can\u2019t go spamming that deal, it doesn\u2019t collect energy for her or give her energy, it\u2019s just a pocket for her to store energy into every single day so she can use it later. It\u2019s a rare skill but not used the way you think it should be used, otherwise Tsunade would have been a different story entirely.",

SasuSaku is second place for Sasuke and NaruHina is second place for Naruto.\n\nNaruSaku is a bit more popular than SasuHina though in fan fics but they're closer to the same level nowadays. Most of the NaruSaku fandom got absorbed by the SasuSaku fandom and they're now SS shippers now.\n\n>Also, why is SasuSaku so popular? Its such a toxic and poorly developed ship imo.\n\nI mean all the canon ships in Naruto are like that. Temari hits Shikamaru, Ino has tried to get into a fist fight with Sai and Sai thought Ino was ugly, Sakura used to beat Naruto's ass constantly and verbally abuse him,  Sasuke & Sakura tried to kill each other and Naruto neglects Hinata when they're married & they barely interacted with each other in the manga\n\nThat said, Sasuke & Sakura look hot together, they have the most development out of the canon ships no matter how poorly written that is and they have the all-loving girl x bad boy dynamic that fans love. That's why SasuSaku is the most popular hetero ship in Naruto",

No other Uchiha had the knowledge, the incentive, the power, or the opportunity to attempt getting Senju chakra to try the same thing. Even in Obito's case, he did have Senju chakra but he didn't live particularly long so it's perfectly possible it just would've awakened at a later date. No one in the manga said that Madara was outright wrong, and that Senju - Uchiha chakra doesn't awaken the rinnegan. They simply say that that isn't the reason Madara's rinnegan specifically awakened.\n\nI dunno, it's a bit speculative but there's plenty of precedent for it. Could be wrong.",

None of those people were alive for particularly long, certainly nowhere near as long as Madara. Danzo didn't have all those sharingan or the Hashirama cells until he was already a fairly old man (we know this thanks to the helpful note that he was assisted by Orochimaru who is much younger and was already a fugitive having left the village when Danzo collaborated with him, and also that his sharingan are from the Uchiha massacre not prior). So he probably wouldn't have manifested rinnegan anyways before dying of old age. Not to mention that his sharingan were all normal 3 tomoe with the exception of Shisui's. That may also play a part. Perhaps one needs to be fully advanced to the mangekyo in order to get the rinnegan; after all the rinnegan is called the final progression of the sharingan by multiple people. That would also explain Obito (besides the time thing) since he didn't have the eternal mangekyo. Same goes for Shin and his clones, not only do they not have eternal mangekyo, they don't even have normal sharingan. Their eyes are somewhat different. \n\nAgain, this is all speculative but there's precedent for it so I wouldn't be surprised if it were the case.",

Kishimoto did her really dirty. I was seriously starting to like her as a character after finishing the Kazekage Rescue Arc but she became my least favorite character in the series by the end of Shippuden. I still dont hate her but god it was really annoying to see just cry and beg in front of Sasuke. She was strong in Shippuden in terms of physical strength and abilities but in terms of mental strength she was still the same old Sakura.",

Its such a toxic and poorly developed ship imo.\n\nI mean all the canon ships in Naruto are like that. Temari hits Shikamaru, Ino has tried to get into a fist fight with Sai and Sai thought Ino was ugly, Sakura used to beat Naruto's ass constantly and verbally abuse him,  Sasuke & Sakura tried to kill each other and Naruto neglects Hinata when they're married & they barely interacted with each other in the manga\n\nThat said, Sasuke & Sakura look hot together, they have the most development out of the canon ships no matter how poorly written that is and they have the all-loving girl x bad boy dynamic that fans love. That's why SasuSaku is the most popular hetero ship in Naruto",

No other Uchiha had the knowledge, the incentive, the power, or the opportunity to attempt getting Senju chakra to try the same thing. Even in Obito's case, he did have Senju chakra but he didn't live particularly long so it's perfectly possible it just would've awakened at a later date. No one in the manga said that Madara was outright wrong, and that Senju - Uchiha chakra doesn't awaken the rinnegan.

None of those people were alive for particularly long, certainly nowhere near as long as Madara. Danzo didn't have all those sharingan or the Hashirama cells until he was already a fairly old man (we know this thanks to the helpful note that he was assisted by Orochimaru who is much younger and was already a fugitive having left the village when Danzo collaborated with him, and also that his sharingan are from the Uchiha massacre not prior). So he probably wouldn't have manifested rinnegan anyways before dying of old age. Not to mention that his sharingan were all normal 3 tomoe with the exception of Shisui's. That may also play a part. Perhaps one needs to be fully advanced to the mangekyo in order to get the rinnegan; after all the rinnegan is called the final progression of the sharingan by multiple people. That would also explain Obito (besides the time thing) since he didn't have the eternal mangekyo. Same goes for Shin and his clones, not only do they not have eternal mangekyo, they don't even have normal sharingan. Their eyes are somewhat different. \n\nAgain, this is all speculative but there's precedent for it so I wouldn't be surprised if it were the case.",

No random Uchiha or Senju/Uzumaki could ever awaken the Rinnegan, not even by procreating with each other. The only way this could ever happen is if, for example, Sarada and Boruto (who carry the bloodlines) have children, and one of their descendants just happens to be the reincarnation of both Ashura and Indra at the same time. Only then is when a person would get a natural Rinnegan. But such a thing is very unlikely to happen at all, as they would most certainly be reincarnated in different people.",

Kishimoto did her really dirty. I was seriously starting to like her as a character after finishing the Kazekage Rescue Arc but she became my least favorite character in the series by the end of Shippuden. I still dont hate her but god it was really annoying to see just cry and beg in front of Sasuke. She was strong in Shippuden in terms of physical strength and abilities but in terms of mental strength she was still the same old Sakura.",

No other Uchiha had the knowledge, the incentive, the power, or the opportunity to attempt getting Senju chakra to try the same thing. Even in Obito's case, he did have Senju chakra but he didn't live particularly long so it's perfectly possible it just would've awakened at a later date. No one in the manga said that Madara was outright wrong, and that Senju - Uchiha chakra doesn't awaken the rinnegan.

None of those people were alive for particularly long, certainly nowhere near as long as Madara. Danzo didn't have all those sharingan or the Hashirama cells until he was already a fairly old man (we know this thanks to the helpful note that he was assisted by Orochimaru who is much younger and was already a fugitive having left the village when Danzo collaborated with him, and also that his sharingan are from the Uchiha massacre not prior). So he probably wouldn't have manifested rinnegan anyways before dying of old age. Not to mention that his sharingan were all normal 3 tomoe with the exception of Shisui's. That may also play a part. Perhaps one needs to be fully advanced to the mangekyo in order to get the rinnegan; after all the rinnegan is called the final progression of the sharingan by multiple people. That would also explain Obito (besides the time thing) since he didn't have the eternal mangekyo. Same goes for Shin and his clones, not only do they not have eternal mangekyo, they don't even have normal sharingan. Their eyes are somewhat different. \n\nAgain, this is all speculative but there's precedent for it so I wouldn't be surprised if it were the case.",

Even in Obito's case, he did have Senju chakra but he didn't live particularly long so it's perfectly possible it just would've awakened at a later date. No one in the manga said that Madara was outright wrong, and that Senju - Uchiha chakra doesn't awaken the rinnegan.

None of those people were alive for particularly long, certainly nowhere near as long as Madara. Danzo didn't have all those sharingan or the Hashirama cells until he was already a fairly old man (we know this thanks to the helpful note that he was assisted by Orochimaru who is much younger and was already a fugitive having left the village when Danzo collaborated with him, and also that his sharingan are from the Uchiha massacre not prior). So he probably wouldn't have manifested rinnegan anyways before dying of old age. Not to mention that his sharingan were all normal 3 tomoe with the exception of Shisui's. That may also play a part. Perhaps one needs to be fully advanced to the mangekyo in order to get the rinnegan; after all the rinnegan is called the final progression of the sharingan by multiple people. That would also explain Obito (besides the time thing) since he didn't have the eternal mangekyo. Same goes for Shin and his clones, not only do they not have eternal mangekyo, they don't even have normal sharingan.

And he was only able to summon it after his rinnegan developed. It looked like he and Hashirama were maybe in their 30s or 40s at the final battle? *Maybe* 50s.

I understood everything she had done and the reasoning why, simply Because I\u2019ve had my heart broken before and also found the love of my life and was completely nervous when meeting up with her. And I\u2019m a man. Lol. But I understand you wanting more involvement with her character.

Madara's case showed us that the rinnegan takes a while to awaken, as it didn't show up until he was in his eighties and close to death. No other Uchiha had the knowledge, the incentive, the power, or the opportunity to attempt getting Senju chakra to try the same thing. Even in Obito's case, he did have Senju chakra but he didn't live particularly long so it's perfectly possible it just would've awakened at a later date. No one in the manga said that Madara was outright wrong, and that Senju - Uchiha chakra doesn't awaken the rinnegan. They simply say that that isn't the reason Madara's rinnegan specifically awakened.\n\nI dunno, it's a bit speculative but there's plenty of precedent for it. Could be wrong.",

None of those people were alive for particularly long, certainly nowhere near as long as Madara. Danzo didn't have all those sharingan or the Hashirama cells until he was already a fairly old man (we know this thanks to the helpful note that he was assisted by Orochimaru who is much younger and was already a fugitive having left the village when Danzo collaborated with him, and also that his sharingan are from the Uchiha massacre not prior). So he probably wouldn't have manifested rinnegan anyways before dying of old age. Not to mention that his sharingan were all normal 3 tomoe with the exception of Shisui's. That may also play a part. Perhaps one needs to be fully advanced to the mangekyo in order to get the rinnegan; after all the rinnegan is called the final progression of the sharingan by multiple people. That would also explain Obito (besides the time thing) since he didn't have the eternal mangekyo. Same goes for Shin and his clones, not only do they not have eternal mangekyo, they don't even have normal sharingan. Their eyes are somewhat different. \n\nAgain, this is all speculative but there's precedent for it so I wouldn't be surprised if it were the case.",

Madara's case showed us that the rinnegan takes a while to awaken, as it didn't show up until he was in his eighties and close to death. No other Uchiha had the knowledge, the incentive, the power, or the opportunity to attempt getting Senju chakra to try the same thing. Even in Obito's case, he did have Senju chakra but he didn't live particularly long so it's perfectly possible it just would've awakened at a later date. No one in the manga said that Madara was outright wrong, and that Senju - Uchiha chakra doesn't awaken the rinnegan. They simply say that that isn't the reason Madara's rinnegan specifically awakened.\n\nI dunno, it's a bit speculative but there's plenty of precedent for it. Could be wrong.",

None of those people were alive for particularly long, certainly nowhere near as long as Madara. Danzo didn't have all those sharingan or the Hashirama cells until he was already a fairly old man (we know this thanks to the helpful note that he was assisted by Orochimaru who is much younger and was already a fugitive having left the village when Danzo collaborated with him, and also that his sharingan are from the Uchiha massacre not prior). So he probably wouldn't have manifested rinnegan anyways before dying of old age. Not to mention that his sharingan were all normal 3 tomoe with the exception of Shisui's. That may also play a part. Perhaps one needs to be fully advanced to the mangekyo in order to get the rinnegan; after all the rinnegan is called the final progression of the sharingan by multiple people. That would also explain Obito (besides the time thing) since he didn't have the eternal mangekyo. Same goes for Shin and his clones, not only do they not have eternal mangekyo, they don't even have normal sharingan. Their eyes are somewhat different. \n\nAgain, this is all speculative but there's precedent for it so I wouldn't be surprised if it were the case.",

None of those people were alive for particularly long, certainly nowhere near as long as Madara. Danzo didn't have all those sharingan or the Hashirama cells until he was already a fairly old man (we know this thanks to the helpful note that he was assisted by Orochimaru who is much younger and was already a fugitive having left the village when Danzo collaborated with him, and also that his sharingan are from the Uchiha massacre not prior). So he probably wouldn't have manifested rinnegan anyways before dying of old age. Not to mention that his sharingan were all normal 3 tomoe with the exception of Shisui's. That may also play a part. Perhaps one needs to be fully advanced to the mangekyo in order to get the rinnegan; after all the rinnegan is called the final progression of the sharingan by multiple people. That would also explain Obito (besides the time thing) since he didn't have the eternal mangekyo. Same goes for Shin and his clones, not only do they not have eternal mangekyo, they don't even have normal sharingan. Their eyes are somewhat different. \n\nAgain, this is all speculative but there's precedent for it so I wouldn't be surprised if it were the case.",

None of those people were alive for particularly long, certainly nowhere near as long as Madara. Danzo didn't have all those sharingan or the Hashirama cells until he was already a fairly old man (we know this thanks to the helpful note that he was assisted by Orochimaru who is much younger and was already a fugitive having left the village when Danzo collaborated with him, and also that his sharingan are from the Uchiha massacre not prior). So he probably wouldn't have manifested rinnegan anyways before dying of old age. Not to mention that his sharingan were all normal 3 tomoe with the exception of Shisui's. That may also play a part. Perhaps one needs to be fully advanced to the mangekyo in order to get the rinnegan; after all the rinnegan is called the final progression of the sharingan by multiple people. That would also explain Obito (besides the time thing) since he didn't have the eternal mangekyo. Same goes for Shin and his clones, not only do they not have eternal mangekyo, they don't even have normal sharingan. Their eyes are somewhat different. \n\nAgain, this is all speculative but there's precedent for it so I wouldn't be surprised if it were the case.",
