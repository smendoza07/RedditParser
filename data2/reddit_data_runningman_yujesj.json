Then ji hyo brought up saying she was making a call on the phone and when the person she was calling to then said she forgot her phone so the person who ji hyo talked said why she forgot her phone. Then Suk jin asked her who she was talking to on the phone and she answered her brother. Then Haha brought up another story.",
