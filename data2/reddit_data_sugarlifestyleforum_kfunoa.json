    "body": "One of the moments I always cherish on dates with my SB is that very first glimpse of her that I see for that day. When she appears from behind the door to pick me up from the entrance of her apartment or when she appears in my line of sight waiting for me near the parking garage close to her apartment.\n\nA smile automatically forms on my face as I see this beautiful woman appearing before my eyes.\n\nToday we decided to have a short little date on her lunch break and I made my way to her family home in the suburbs where she has her dog with her.\n\nAs I turned round the corner to her house, I saw my SB and her dog waiting adorably for me at the sidewalk and the biggest smile automatically formed on my face.\n\nShe introduced me to her dog and her dog\u2019s tail was wagging which I hope is a good sign \ud83d\ude06\n\nAnd now I will always have this adorable memory of her and her dog waiting for me. The two of them so perfect individually and together.\n\nIt\u2019s been six months since we\u2019ve been in a SR and I still get so excited whenever I catch that first glimpse of my SB for the day. \n\nAnd I hope that excitement will last for as long as it can. \u2764\ufe0f",

            "body": "The first time I saw my SGF (26) in real life, I (51) was sitting in a nice Italian Restaurant (Angelines in Charlotte, NC) and waiting for her Uber to arrive. The moment she walked in the door, I was stunned. She was BEAUTIFUL! She was wearing a pinkish club dress and high heels... It turns out that this is ALL she was wearing. \ud83d\ude0d\n\nWe ended up having a great dinner and conversation. She asked me if I had ever tried pickle back with whiskey. I hadn't... and while I will never drink that again in life, we ended up having a couple of those in addition to the double Titos and Ginger that I prefer. Whenever she mentions pickle back she does this cute little thing with her tongue on her teeth. I don't know how to describe it. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nI am not sure if I am an anomaly, but I tell all of the girls that I have met on SA the same thing. I thank them for dinner and conversation and give them the money they requested for PPM right then. Then, I ask them if they would be interested in continuing the evening. In her case, she smiled and said \"Absolutely!\". \n\nWhen we left the restaurant to walk to my car (which was parked a few blocks away in a parking garage due to President Trump visiting for a campaign rally), we found that the entire area was locked down due to an impromptu Black Lives Matter protest (which I support btw). There were walls of police blocking every path to my car except the ramp where the cars drive out. This ramp begins underground, so it is a very steep incline. I picked her up and carried her down the ramp and she was giggling and shreeking the entire way down. Once we got to the bottom and I put her down, she grabbed me and kissed me. \ud83d\ude0d\n\nWe spent the rest of the evening talking and ultimately ended up in bed laying in each other's arms exhausted from making love.\n\nFast forward 4 months and now she is my SGF (kinda vanilla but I'm still giving her support - read spoil her). I have been frustrated at points and she probably has too (we both suffer from anxiety) ... But all of that fades as soon as we see each other. She wraps her arms around me kisses me so passionately every time I pick her up and every time I drop her off. Many times we sit in the car at the end of the night with her asking me for more kisses...\n\nI am 3x divorced. I have fallen for her (for the record, she told me first). Will it last long term? I sure hope so... But I am a realist and a romantic. It is better to love and lost than to never have loved at all. She is so beautiful, intelligent and sweetly naughty and is an amazing lover. She really makes me look forward to my week. She makes me feel like I have a purpose in my personal life.",
