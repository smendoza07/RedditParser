Oh! so one of our most talented and dangerous shinobi went rouge because we didn't like him killing people and experimenting on their bodies, hope that doesn't turn out wrong let's not track his movements whatsoever and let him roam free. Oh look at that he created his own village and their joining the chunin exams  held in the he village he hates so much. Oh he interrupted the exams and almost killed one of the curator's let's not investigate the shinobi from his villages (sand and sound) and let's \"beef up\" security with a few more chunin level guards who can't undo genjutsu.\n\nHiruzen is probably the second worst Hokage in history",

That is basically only used to do evil including attacking the leaf and being the main fighting force for the enemy during the 4th ninja war. Tobirama did more damage to the ninja world. People dislike hiruzen because he is soft on orochimaru and danzo but hashirama was equally soft towards his enemies. Arguably hashirama should have killed madara a long time ago then none of this happens. If he kills madara the Uchiha surrender and he could have made the village anyway with an alliance with the other Uchiha. Ultimately with his teaching and philosophy hiruzen spread the will of fire to multiple generations. I'll take that over the fucking chunin exams and anbu, which almost any military leader would establish.

I didn't say the dude was perfect but his mistakes were less damaging than tobiramas. Of course he started spying on the Uchiha they were planning a coup that would have started a civil war it would be irresponsible to not watch them. It's also implied that the foundation did stop a lot of harm to the leaf at times as well not just all evil shit. The light can't beat everything that's why darkness is needed sometimes.  Same reason orochimaru is given autonomy in boruto. Sometimes you need a monster to beat a monster. Let's be clear tobiramas mistakes fucked up the entire ninja world not just the leaf. Hiruzen never did anything half as harmful as creating the reanimation jutsu. Also keep in mind that not killing orochimaru was kind of like not killing gollum in lord of the rings he ends up doing good in the end lol.",

This show has themes and light needing the darkness is one of them. That's why Naruto needs Sasuke. \n\nThis is also a world were every old person was at one time a child soldier this is an extremely violent place we are talking about. Kids are trained to kill at the age of like 6 or 7 so get over it I guess. Watch the first big fight in Naruto. Zabuza a fan favorite uses a little boy as his tool in a very inappropriate relationship. This is the process of a violent treacherous world slowly becoming less violent and treacherous another theme in the show. The leaders are trying to make sense of a terrible world without a guide book. Compare the leaf to the blood mist village or the sand during the same point in time I'm betting you'd like to be In hiruzens village rather than anywhere else.",

You don't really read the manga properly. \nThe Hokage **election** is sort of democratical. Since the both the Jonin and the Fire Lord **must** approve the candidate.\nOnce the Hokage is elected, he very much is a dictator. \nHashirama **was not a Hokage** when he tried to make Madara one, there was no Hokage by then.\n\n\n\n\n>Danzo did not have his station until his death.\n\nExcept he was?? He was still one of the elders and he still controlled Root.\n\n\n\n\n>Hiruzen couldn't have known he was still fucking with the foundation because everyone in the foundation had a silence curse mark on them.\n\nHe did know lol. Danzo created the Root and it was still running under Hiruzen.\n\n\n\n>Did the Uchiha ever once talk to the hokage about their displeasure not that I know of they just got pissed and started plotting a coup\n\nNo, they do not.",

He was pretty much just telling Sasuke to give up which was wrong for so many reasons but the main one being Itachi at the forefront of the kid's mind for the past 6-7 years; letting go was not that simple. Just imagine the nightmares.\n\nThe equivalent of what Kakashi did is telling a long time drug addict the consequences of drugs, telling them to stop and then leaving them to their own devices expecting them to stop. \n\n> The story clearly indicates that, had the Oto Nin not interfered, Kakashi could have actually changed Sasuke\u2018s mind. \n\nYeah, because Kakashi used Sasuke's words against him in a misleading way (it was very shinobi of him).\n\nThat's why I never liked Kakashi's talk with Sasuke. He makes seem like he went through a tragedy similar to Sasuke but all his loved ones died in non regrettable situations, whether that's going out by their own violation, or dying doing their duty as shinobi/shinobi leaders. \n\nKakashi's backstory is sad, arguably sadder than Sasuke's, but it's not as traumatizing, just depressing. How is he supposed to personally understand Sasuke's feeling of betrayal and desire for revenge (watching your whole family get slaughtered by the person you trusted most in the world so he could \"test\" his power, during a \"peaceful\" era too) or need for power (I mean, he was Jonin at Sasuke's age).",

They are also the last known Uchihas to develop the mangekyo sharingan through the original asamuku uso method, which involved placing yourself under genjutsu and convincing yourself that an enemy combatant was a loved one. Then, by gruesomely torturing that loved one, they awoke even stronger Mangekyo Sharingans than any other character in the series. They are by far some of the most despicable and bloodthirsty characters in the manga, were easily Kage level, and were going to be the cornerstone of the Uchiha rebellion.\n\nSo yeah, LOL, act like Itachi wasn't doing the world a favor when you're just spouting your \"DANK MEME\" in ignorance.",

He could've just targeted only members of the coup. Like, we know for fact there were other Uchiha children and elderly and other casual Uchiha citizens who wouldn't reasonably have known anything about the coup. What was the point of killing them? And what about Uchiha who married outside the clan. I'm certain some exist, even the Hyuga sometimes married outside the clan, and they're way more obsessive pureblood zealots than the Uchiha ever were. Not to mention we sometimes see random children in the background of certain panels of the manga (and clips of the anime of course) who are wearing the Uchiha crest. I doubt that shit is being sold as merchandise, that'd be extremely inappropriate and insensitive.",

That is basically only used to do evil including attacking the leaf and being the main fighting force for the enemy during the 4th ninja war. Tobirama did more damage to the ninja world. People dislike hiruzen because he is soft on orochimaru and danzo but hashirama was equally soft towards his enemies. Arguably hashirama should have killed madara a long time ago then none of this happens. If he kills madara the Uchiha surrender and he could have made the village anyway with an alliance with the other Uchiha. Ultimately with his teaching and philosophy hiruzen spread the will of fire to multiple generations. I'll take that over the fucking chunin exams and anbu, which almost any military leader would establish.

I didn't say the dude was perfect but his mistakes were less damaging than tobiramas. Of course he started spying on the Uchiha they were planning a coup that would have started a civil war it would be irresponsible to not watch them. It's also implied that the foundation did stop a lot of harm to the leaf at times as well not just all evil shit. The light can't beat everything that's why darkness is needed sometimes.  Same reason orochimaru is given autonomy in boruto. Sometimes you need a monster to beat a monster. Let's be clear tobiramas mistakes fucked up the entire ninja world not just the leaf. Hiruzen never did anything half as harmful as creating the reanimation jutsu. Also keep in mind that not killing orochimaru was kind of like not killing gollum in lord of the rings he ends up doing good in the end lol.",

You act like hiruzen was watching everytime something bad happened. Like he knew every single thing danzo and orochimaru did while they were doing it. They were ninja trying to keep a secret. This show has themes and light needing the darkness is one of them. That's why Naruto needs Sasuke. \n\nThis is also a world were every old person was at one time a child soldier this is an extremely violent place we are talking about. Kids are trained to kill at the age of like 6 or 7 so get over it I guess. Watch the first big fight in Naruto. Zabuza a fan favorite uses a little boy as his tool in a very inappropriate relationship. This is the process of a violent treacherous world slowly becoming less violent and treacherous another theme in the show. The leaders are trying to make sense of a terrible world without a guide book. Compare the leaf to the blood mist village or the sand during the same point in time I'm betting you'd like to be In hiruzens village rather than anywhere else.",

It didn't come from nowhere so I'm betting it came from the dude who distrusted all of the Uchiha.",

He is absolutely trying to kill him with reaper death seal and only takes his arms at the end when he realizes he doesn't have the power to take his whole soul.

The moment he actually might try, he realizes that he can't actually.\n\n\n\n\n>The massive army didn't have shit to do with chunin exams or anbu his contributions. So is tsunade a great hokage because she introduced having a medical ninja on all teams? Having a good idea doesn't make you a great leader. \n\nAre you for real??\nWhere exactly do you think that massive army was trained lol?? In the streets??\nAre you actually trying to argue that there's no correlation between the schools and military institutions Tobirama created and later everyone would replicate... And the armies and Shinobis we see in the series... All educated and trained... In those same institutions??\n\nFor real?? But yes, positivity wins the day.

Tobirama let Hiruzen a stable village.

He was pretty much just telling Sasuke to give up which was wrong for so many reasons but the main one being Itachi at the forefront of the kid's mind for the past 6-7 years; letting go was not that simple. Just imagine the nightmares.\n\nThe equivalent of what Kakashi did is telling a long time drug addict the consequences of drugs, telling them to stop and then leaving them to their own devices expecting them to stop. \n\n> The story clearly indicates that, had the Oto Nin not interfered, Kakashi could have actually changed Sasuke\u2018s mind. \n\nYeah, because Kakashi used Sasuke's words against him in a misleading way (it was very shinobi of him).\n\nThat's why I never liked Kakashi's talk with Sasuke. He makes seem like he went through a tragedy similar to Sasuke but all his loved ones died in non regrettable situations, whether that's going out by their own violation, or dying doing their duty as shinobi/shinobi leaders. \n\nKakashi's backstory is sad, arguably sadder than Sasuke's, but it's not as traumatizing, just depressing. How is he supposed to personally understand Sasuke's feeling of betrayal and desire for revenge (watching your whole family get slaughtered by the person you trusted most in the world so he could \"test\" his power, during a \"peaceful\" era too) or need for power (I mean, he was Jonin at Sasuke's age).",

Itachi always had constant reminders of how much better he was than the average person, especially in comparison to Sasuke. So him being as smart as he was; thinking that making Sasuke hateful was the approach made no sense to me as it led him down a dark path, literally giving opportunities for people like Orochimaru to take advantage of him. \n\nWhat was Orochimaru's main claim when getting Sasuke on his side, \"Don't you want the power to kill Itachi?\"",

Oh he interrupted the exams and almost killed one of the curator's let's not investigate the shinobi from his villages (sand and sound) and let's \"beef up\" security with a few more chunin level guards who can't undo genjutsu.\n\nHiruzen is probably the second worst Hokage in history",

That is basically only used to do evil including attacking the leaf and being the main fighting force for the enemy during the 4th ninja war. Tobirama did more damage to the ninja world. People dislike hiruzen because he is soft on orochimaru and danzo but hashirama was equally soft towards his enemies. Arguably hashirama should have killed madara a long time ago then none of this happens. If he kills madara the Uchiha surrender and he could have made the village anyway with an alliance with the other Uchiha. Ultimately with his teaching and philosophy hiruzen spread the will of fire to multiple generations. I'll take that over the fucking chunin exams and anbu, which almost any military leader would establish.

I didn't say the dude was perfect but his mistakes were less damaging than tobiramas. Of course he started spying on the Uchiha they were planning a coup that would have started a civil war it would be irresponsible to not watch them. It's also implied that the foundation did stop a lot of harm to the leaf at times as well not just all evil shit. The light can't beat everything that's why darkness is needed sometimes.  Same reason orochimaru is given autonomy in boruto. Sometimes you need a monster to beat a monster. Let's be clear tobiramas mistakes fucked up the entire ninja world not just the leaf. Hiruzen never did anything half as harmful as creating the reanimation jutsu. Also keep in mind that not killing orochimaru was kind of like not killing gollum in lord of the rings he ends up doing good in the end lol.",

That's why Naruto needs Sasuke. \n\nThis is also a world were every old person was at one time a child soldier this is an extremely violent place we are talking about. Kids are trained to kill at the age of like 6 or 7 so get over it I guess. Watch the first big fight in Naruto. Zabuza a fan favorite uses a little boy as his tool in a very inappropriate relationship. This is the process of a violent treacherous world slowly becoming less violent and treacherous another theme in the show.

And remember I'm pretty sure danzo was a body guard to tobirama where do you think he learned all his distrust for the Uchiha from. It didn't come from nowhere so I'm betting it came from the dude who distrusted all of the Uchiha.",

He was pretty much just telling Sasuke to give up which was wrong for so many reasons but the main one being Itachi at the forefront of the kid's mind for the past 6-7 years; letting go was not that simple. Just imagine the nightmares.\n\nThe equivalent of what Kakashi did is telling a long time drug addict the consequences of drugs, telling them to stop and then leaving them to their own devices expecting them to stop. \n\n> The story clearly indicates that, had the Oto Nin not interfered, Kakashi could have actually changed Sasuke\u2018s mind. \n\nYeah, because Kakashi used Sasuke's words against him in a misleading way (it was very shinobi of him).\n\nThat's why I never liked Kakashi's talk with Sasuke. He makes seem like he went through a tragedy similar to Sasuke but all his loved ones died in non regrettable situations, whether that's going out by their own violation, or dying doing their duty as shinobi/shinobi leaders. \n\nKakashi's backstory is sad, arguably sadder than Sasuke's, but it's not as traumatizing, just depressing. How is he supposed to personally understand Sasuke's feeling of betrayal and desire for revenge (watching your whole family get slaughtered by the person you trusted most in the world so he could \"test\" his power, during a \"peaceful\" era too) or need for power (I mean, he was Jonin at Sasuke's age).",

Even if Sasuke never learned the truth, he's already a missing-nin, he has no home and I wouldn't want that on my own brother. And despite his status, Itachi still planned on forcing Sasuke back to Konoha through Mind Control. \n\nIf I was Itachi, I would just tell Sasuke what Itachi told him when the Edo Tensei was being released, tell him he has a limited time to train and then let him do his own thing.

That is basically only used to do evil including attacking the leaf and being the main fighting force for the enemy during the 4th ninja war. Tobirama did more damage to the ninja world. People dislike hiruzen because he is soft on orochimaru and danzo but hashirama was equally soft towards his enemies. Arguably hashirama should have killed madara a long time ago then none of this happens. If he kills madara the Uchiha surrender and he could have made the village anyway with an alliance with the other Uchiha. Ultimately with his teaching and philosophy hiruzen spread the will of fire to multiple generations. I'll take that over the fucking chunin exams and anbu, which almost any military leader would establish. It doesn't take a genius to know you should have a way to test your recruits and have an elite fighting force under your control",

I didn't say the dude was perfect but his mistakes were less damaging than tobiramas. Of course he started spying on the Uchiha they were planning a coup that would have started a civil war it would be irresponsible to not watch them. It's also implied that the foundation did stop a lot of harm to the leaf at times as well not just all evil shit. The light can't beat everything that's why darkness is needed sometimes.  Same reason orochimaru is given autonomy in boruto. Sometimes you need a monster to beat a monster. Let's be clear tobiramas mistakes fucked up the entire ninja world not just the leaf. Hiruzen never did anything half as harmful as creating the reanimation jutsu. Also keep in mind that not killing orochimaru was kind of like not killing gollum in lord of the rings he ends up doing good in the end lol.",

That's why Naruto needs Sasuke. \n\nThis is also a world were every old person was at one time a child soldier this is an extremely violent place we are talking about. Kids are trained to kill at the age of like 6 or 7 so get over it I guess. Watch the first big fight in Naruto. Zabuza a fan favorite uses a little boy as his tool in a very inappropriate relationship. This is the process of a violent treacherous world slowly becoming less violent and treacherous another theme in the show. The leaders are trying to make sense of a terrible world without a guide book.

You don't really read the manga properly. \nThe Hokage **election** is sort of democratical. Since the both the Jonin and the Fire Lord **must** approve the candidate.\nOnce the Hokage is elected, he very much is a dictator. \nHashirama **was not a Hokage** when he tried to make Madara one, there was no Hokage by then.\n\n\n\n\n>Danzo did not have his station until his death.\n\nExcept he was?? He was still one of the elders and he still controlled Root.\n\n\n\n\n>Hiruzen couldn't have known he was still fucking with the foundation because everyone in the foundation had a silence curse mark on them.\n\nHe did know lol. Danzo created the Root and it was still running under Hiruzen.\n\n\n\n>Did the Uchiha ever once talk to the hokage about their displeasure not that I know of they just got pissed and started plotting a coup\n\nNo, they do not.",

He was pretty much just telling Sasuke to give up which was wrong for so many reasons but the main one being Itachi at the forefront of the kid's mind for the past 6-7 years; letting go was not that simple. Just imagine the nightmares.\n\nThe equivalent of what Kakashi did is telling a long time drug addict the consequences of drugs, telling them to stop and then leaving them to their own devices expecting them to stop. \n\n> The story clearly indicates that, had the Oto Nin not interfered, Kakashi could have actually changed Sasuke\u2018s mind. \n\nYeah, because Kakashi used Sasuke's words against him in a misleading way (it was very shinobi of him).\n\nThat's why I never liked Kakashi's talk with Sasuke. He makes seem like he went through a tragedy similar to Sasuke but all his loved ones died in non regrettable situations, whether that's going out by their own violation, or dying doing their duty as shinobi/shinobi leaders. \n\nKakashi's backstory is sad, arguably sadder than Sasuke's, but it's not as traumatizing, just depressing. How is he supposed to personally understand Sasuke's feeling of betrayal and desire for revenge (watching your whole family get slaughtered by the person you trusted most in the world so he could \"test\" his power, during a \"peaceful\" era too) or need for power (I mean, he was Jonin at Sasuke's age).",

Even if Sasuke never learned the truth, he's already a missing-nin, he has no home and I wouldn't want that on my own brother. And despite his status, Itachi still planned on forcing Sasuke back to Konoha through Mind Control. \n\nIf I was Itachi, I would just tell Sasuke what Itachi told him when the Edo Tensei was being released, tell him he has a limited time to train and then let him do his own thing.

Itachi always had constant reminders of how much better he was than the average person, especially in comparison to Sasuke. So him being as smart as he was; thinking that making Sasuke hateful was the approach made no sense to me as it led him down a dark path, literally giving opportunities for people like Orochimaru to take advantage of him. \n\nWhat was Orochimaru's main claim when getting Sasuke on his side, \"Don't you want the power to kill Itachi?\"",

That is basically only used to do evil including attacking the leaf and being the main fighting force for the enemy during the 4th ninja war. Tobirama did more damage to the ninja world. People dislike hiruzen because he is soft on orochimaru and danzo but hashirama was equally soft towards his enemies. Arguably hashirama should have killed madara a long time ago then none of this happens. If he kills madara the Uchiha surrender and he could have made the village anyway with an alliance with the other Uchiha. Ultimately with his teaching and philosophy hiruzen spread the will of fire to multiple generations. I'll take that over the fucking chunin exams and anbu, which almost any military leader would establish.

I didn't say the dude was perfect but his mistakes were less damaging than tobiramas. Of course he started spying on the Uchiha they were planning a coup that would have started a civil war it would be irresponsible to not watch them. It's also implied that the foundation did stop a lot of harm to the leaf at times as well not just all evil shit. The light can't beat everything that's why darkness is needed sometimes.  Same reason orochimaru is given autonomy in boruto. Sometimes you need a monster to beat a monster. Let's be clear tobiramas mistakes fucked up the entire ninja world not just the leaf. Hiruzen never did anything half as harmful as creating the reanimation jutsu. Also keep in mind that not killing orochimaru was kind of like not killing gollum in lord of the rings he ends up doing good in the end lol.",

That's why Naruto needs Sasuke. \n\nThis is also a world were every old person was at one time a child soldier this is an extremely violent place we are talking about. Kids are trained to kill at the age of like 6 or 7 so get over it I guess. Watch the first big fight in Naruto. Zabuza a fan favorite uses a little boy as his tool in a very inappropriate relationship. This is the process of a violent treacherous world slowly becoming less violent and treacherous another theme in the show.

You don't really read the manga properly. \nThe Hokage **election** is sort of democratical. Since the both the Jonin and the Fire Lord **must** approve the candidate.\nOnce the Hokage is elected, he very much is a dictator. \nHashirama **was not a Hokage** when he tried to make Madara one, there was no Hokage by then.\n\n\n\n\n>Danzo did not have his station until his death.\n\nExcept he was?? He was still one of the elders and he still controlled Root.\n\n\n\n\n>Hiruzen couldn't have known he was still fucking with the foundation because everyone in the foundation had a silence curse mark on them.\n\nHe did know lol. Danzo created the Root and it was still running under Hiruzen.\n\n\n\n>Did the Uchiha ever once talk to the hokage about their displeasure not that I know of they just got pissed and started plotting a coup\n\nNo, they do not.",

Guy and Kakashi with a small team could probably take on several platoons by themselves plus the prospect of facing Tsunade, Jiraiya, or even worse a rampaging Kyuubi.\n\nSuna and Konoha also formed a formal alliance shortly afterwards so the invaders would likely have to face Gaara as well. Unless the other villages formed an alliance and attack Konoha and Suna separately, I don't think it was a viable option to invade just one of them. Suna's invasion only worked because Orochimaru and Kabuto acted as insiders and helped from the inside. Attacking from the outside is a different challenge logistically.",

Itachi always had constant reminders of how much better he was than the average person, especially in comparison to Sasuke. So him being as smart as he was; thinking that making Sasuke hateful was the approach made no sense to me as it led him down a dark path, literally giving opportunities for people like Orochimaru to take advantage of him. \n\nWhat was Orochimaru's main claim when getting Sasuke on his side, \"Don't you want the power to kill Itachi?\"",

That is basically only used to do evil including attacking the leaf and being the main fighting force for the enemy during the 4th ninja war. Tobirama did more damage to the ninja world. People dislike hiruzen because he is soft on orochimaru and danzo but hashirama was equally soft towards his enemies. Arguably hashirama should have killed madara a long time ago then none of this happens. If he kills madara the Uchiha surrender and he could have made the village anyway with an alliance with the other Uchiha. Ultimately with his teaching and philosophy hiruzen spread the will of fire to multiple generations. I'll take that over the fucking chunin exams and anbu, which almost any military leader would establish.

It's also implied that the foundation did stop a lot of harm to the leaf at times as well not just all evil shit. The light can't beat everything that's why darkness is needed sometimes.  Same reason orochimaru is given autonomy in boruto. Sometimes you need a monster to beat a monster. Let's be clear tobiramas mistakes fucked up the entire ninja world not just the leaf. Hiruzen never did anything half as harmful as creating the reanimation jutsu.

Kids are trained to kill at the age of like 6 or 7 so get over it I guess. Watch the first big fight in Naruto. Zabuza a fan favorite uses a little boy as his tool in a very inappropriate relationship.

So him being as smart as he was; thinking that making Sasuke hateful was the approach made no sense to me as it led him down a dark path, literally giving opportunities for people like Orochimaru to take advantage of him. \n\nWhat was Orochimaru's main claim when getting Sasuke on his side, \"Don't you want the power to kill Itachi?\"",

That is basically only used to do evil including attacking the leaf and being the main fighting force for the enemy during the 4th ninja war. Tobirama did more damage to the ninja world. People dislike hiruzen because he is soft on orochimaru and danzo but hashirama was equally soft towards his enemies. Arguably hashirama should have killed madara a long time ago then none of this happens. If he kills madara the Uchiha surrender and he could have made the village anyway with an alliance with the other Uchiha. Ultimately with his teaching and philosophy hiruzen spread the will of fire to multiple generations. I'll take that over the fucking chunin exams and anbu, which almost any military leader would establish.

I didn't say the dude was perfect but his mistakes were less damaging than tobiramas. Of course he started spying on the Uchiha they were planning a coup that would have started a civil war it would be irresponsible to not watch them. It's also implied that the foundation did stop a lot of harm to the leaf at times as well not just all evil shit. The light can't beat everything that's why darkness is needed sometimes.  Same reason orochimaru is given autonomy in boruto. Sometimes you need a monster to beat a monster. Let's be clear tobiramas mistakes fucked up the entire ninja world not just the leaf. Hiruzen never did anything half as harmful as creating the reanimation jutsu. Also keep in mind that not killing orochimaru was kind of like not killing gollum in lord of the rings he ends up doing good in the end lol.",

That's why Naruto needs Sasuke. \n\nThis is also a world were every old person was at one time a child soldier this is an extremely violent place we are talking about. Kids are trained to kill at the age of like 6 or 7 so get over it I guess. Watch the first big fight in Naruto. Zabuza a fan favorite uses a little boy as his tool in a very inappropriate relationship. This is the process of a violent treacherous world slowly becoming less violent and treacherous another theme in the show. The leaders are trying to make sense of a terrible world without a guide book. Compare the leaf to the blood mist village or the sand during the same point in time I'm betting you'd like to be In hiruzens village rather than anywhere else.",

He is absolutely trying to kill him with reaper death seal and only takes his arms at the end when he realizes he doesn't have the power to take his whole soul. You can do better. \n\nNo, you can do better. Hiruzen never had any intention to kill. The moment he actually might try, he realizes that he can't actually.\n\n\n\n\n>The massive army didn't have shit to do with chunin exams or anbu his contributions. So is tsunade a great hokage because she introduced having a medical ninja on all teams? Having a good idea doesn't make you a great leader. \n\nAre you for real??\nWhere exactly do you think that massive army was trained lol?? In the streets??\nAre you actually trying to argue that there's no correlation between the schools and military institutions Tobirama created and later everyone would replicate... And the armies and Shinobis we see in the series... All educated and trained... In those same institutions??\n\nFor real?? But yes, positivity wins the day. Who the hell cares of actual ruling when you can just say \"will of fire\".\n\n\n\n\n\n>but tobiramas short sightedness with his jutsu and the Uchiha did more damage than hiruzen trusting danzo too long\n\nLol. Tobirama let Hiruzen a stable village. And he and Danzo managed to alienate the Uchiha to the point of only genocide being the alternative.\n\nYou can keep arguing that superstition is the reason why things are wrong tho.\n\n\n\n\n>And remember I'm pretty sure danzo was a body guard to tobirama\n\nYes.\n\n\n\n\n>where do you think he learned all his distrust for the Uchiha from.\n\nDon't know, since Tobirama's actual **students** do not present such prejudice lol.\n\n\n\n>It didn't come from nowhere so I'm betting it came from the dude who distrusted all of the Uchiha.\n\nAnd you'd be wrong.",

Danzo did that.\nThe Police Force was on the outskirts of the village, but that's a **work place**, nor where they lived.\n\n\n\n>that and created suspicion on both sides.\n\nNo, he said that granting them a lot of power turned them arrogant and that people disliked cops. That's about it. \nIt's the dumbest reasoning I've ever heard.\n\n\n\n>He also has a very legitimate point about how dumb it was to create the reanimation jutsu.\n\nEeeh no.\nHe doesn't.

People dislike hiruzen because he is soft on orochimaru and danzo but hashirama was equally soft towards his enemies. Arguably hashirama should have killed madara a long time ago then none of this happens. If he kills madara the Uchiha surrender and he could have made the village anyway with an alliance with the other Uchiha. Ultimately with his teaching and philosophy hiruzen spread the will of fire to multiple generations.

I didn't say the dude was perfect but his mistakes were less damaging than tobiramas. Of course he started spying on the Uchiha they were planning a coup that would have started a civil war it would be irresponsible to not watch them. It's also implied that the foundation did stop a lot of harm to the leaf at times as well not just all evil shit. The light can't beat everything that's why darkness is needed sometimes.  Same reason orochimaru is given autonomy in boruto. Sometimes you need a monster to beat a monster. Let's be clear tobiramas mistakes fucked up the entire ninja world not just the leaf. Hiruzen never did anything half as harmful as creating the reanimation jutsu. Also keep in mind that not killing orochimaru was kind of like not killing gollum in lord of the rings he ends up doing good in the end lol.",

That's why Naruto needs Sasuke. \n\nThis is also a world were every old person was at one time a child soldier this is an extremely violent place we are talking about. Kids are trained to kill at the age of like 6 or 7 so get over it I guess. Watch the first big fight in Naruto. Zabuza a fan favorite uses a little boy as his tool in a very inappropriate relationship. This is the process of a violent treacherous world slowly becoming less violent and treacherous another theme in the show.

Have you seen Naruto as Hokage??\n\n\n\n\n>Compared to the leaf village the other villages weren't as strong. They all had anbu and chunnin exams but the village with the will of fire was better than all of them\n\n??? This is a good strawman.\nNot only this is just partially true... But what this has to do with your original point??\n\n\n\n\n>No one did it before him because there were no villages before hashirama so how would anybody else have created the chunnin exams or the anbu before that?\n\nTobirama was the second Hokage. He created those institutions after Hashirama was death and that was years after the creation of not only the Leaf but of every other major village.\nYou can do better than this.",

Danzo did that.\nThe Police Force was on the outskirts of the village, but that's a **work place**, nor where they lived.\n\n\n\n>that and created suspicion on both sides.\n\nNo, he said that granting them a lot of power turned them arrogant and that people disliked cops. That's about it. \nIt's the dumbest reasoning I've ever heard.\n\n\n\n>He also has a very legitimate point about how dumb it was to create the reanimation jutsu.\n\nEeeh no.\nHe doesn't. People might misuse it it's not a legitimate reason lol, people might misuse a good lot of things.",

People dislike hiruzen because he is soft on orochimaru and danzo but hashirama was equally soft towards his enemies. Arguably hashirama should have killed madara a long time ago then none of this happens. If he kills madara the Uchiha surrender and he could have made the village anyway with an alliance with the other Uchiha. Ultimately with his teaching and philosophy hiruzen spread the will of fire to multiple generations. I'll take that over the fucking chunin exams and anbu, which almost any military leader would establish. It doesn't take a genius to know you should have a way to test your recruits and have an elite fighting force under your control",

I didn't say the dude was perfect but his mistakes were less damaging than tobiramas. Of course he started spying on the Uchiha they were planning a coup that would have started a civil war it would be irresponsible to not watch them. It's also implied that the foundation did stop a lot of harm to the leaf at times as well not just all evil shit. The light can't beat everything that's why darkness is needed sometimes.  Same reason orochimaru is given autonomy in boruto. Sometimes you need a monster to beat a monster. Let's be clear tobiramas mistakes fucked up the entire ninja world not just the leaf. Hiruzen never did anything half as harmful as creating the reanimation jutsu. Also keep in mind that not killing orochimaru was kind of like not killing gollum in lord of the rings he ends up doing good in the end lol.",

Well he was the only one who dabbled with that becuz he had access and the knowledge to do so.\n\n\nAnd you are disgusting, its not a matter of light and darkness to take  an orphan and do science experiments with it to finally construct a clone after many torturous failed ones.

Like he knew every single thing danzo and orochimaru did while they were doing it. They were ninja trying to keep a secret. This show has themes and light needing the darkness is one of them. That's why Naruto needs Sasuke. \n\nThis is also a world were every old person was at one time a child soldier this is an extremely violent place we are talking about. Kids are trained to kill at the age of like 6 or 7 so get over it I guess. Watch the first big fight in Naruto. Zabuza a fan favorite uses a little boy as his tool in a very inappropriate relationship. This is the process of a violent treacherous world slowly becoming less violent and treacherous another theme in the show. The leaders are trying to make sense of a terrible world without a guide book. Compare the leaf to the blood mist village or the sand during the same point in time I'm betting you'd like to be In hiruzens village rather than anywhere else.",

You don't really read the manga properly. \nThe Hokage **election** is sort of democratical. Since the both the Jonin and the Fire Lord **must** approve the candidate.\nOnce the Hokage is elected, he very much is a dictator. \nHashirama **was not a Hokage** when he tried to make Madara one, there was no Hokage by then.\n\n\n\n\n>Danzo did not have his station until his death.\n\nExcept he was??

People dislike hiruzen because he is soft on orochimaru and danzo but hashirama was equally soft towards his enemies. Arguably hashirama should have killed madara a long time ago then none of this happens. If he kills madara the Uchiha surrender and he could have made the village anyway with an alliance with the other Uchiha. Ultimately with his teaching and philosophy hiruzen spread the will of fire to multiple generations.

I didn't say the dude was perfect but his mistakes were less damaging than tobiramas. Of course he started spying on the Uchiha they were planning a coup that would have started a civil war it would be irresponsible to not watch them. It's also implied that the foundation did stop a lot of harm to the leaf at times as well not just all evil shit. The light can't beat everything that's why darkness is needed sometimes.  Same reason orochimaru is given autonomy in boruto. Sometimes you need a monster to beat a monster. Let's be clear tobiramas mistakes fucked up the entire ninja world not just the leaf. Hiruzen never did anything half as harmful as creating the reanimation jutsu. Also keep in mind that not killing orochimaru was kind of like not killing gollum in lord of the rings he ends up doing good in the end lol.",

That's why Naruto needs Sasuke. \n\nThis is also a world were every old person was at one time a child soldier this is an extremely violent place we are talking about. Kids are trained to kill at the age of like 6 or 7 so get over it I guess. Watch the first big fight in Naruto. Zabuza a fan favorite uses a little boy as his tool in a very inappropriate relationship. This is the process of a violent treacherous world slowly becoming less violent and treacherous another theme in the show.

Have you seen Naruto as Hokage??\n\n\n\n\n>Compared to the leaf village the other villages weren't as strong. They all had anbu and chunnin exams but the village with the will of fire was better than all of them\n\n??? This is a good strawman.\nNot only this is just partially true... But what this has to do with your original point??\n\n\n\n\n>No one did it before him because there were no villages before hashirama so how would anybody else have created the chunnin exams or the anbu before that?\n\nTobirama was the second Hokage. He created those institutions after Hashirama was death and that was years after the creation of not only the Leaf but of every other major village.\nYou can do better than this.",

That's why Naruto needs Sasuke. \n\nThis is also a world were every old person was at one time a child soldier this is an extremely violent place we are talking about. Kids are trained to kill at the age of like 6 or 7 so get over it I guess. Watch the first big fight in Naruto. Zabuza a fan favorite uses a little boy as his tool in a very inappropriate relationship. This is the process of a violent treacherous world slowly becoming less violent and treacherous another theme in the show.

How do you think a massive army is gathered to fight against evil if not trough bureaucracy.\nAre you actually arguing that bureaucracy is immaterial??\nLike, as long as you have positivity, it's on?? Have you seen Naruto as Hokage??\n\n\n\n\n>Compared to the leaf village the other villages weren't as strong.

But what this has to do with your original point??\n\n\n\n\n>No one did it before him because there were no villages before hashirama so how would anybody else have created the chunnin exams or the anbu before that?\n\nTobirama was the second Hokage. He created those institutions after Hashirama was death and that was years after the creation of not only the Leaf but of every other major village.\nYou can do better than this.",

It's also implied that the foundation did stop a lot of harm to the leaf at times as well not just all evil shit. The light can't beat everything that's why darkness is needed sometimes.  Same reason orochimaru is given autonomy in boruto. Sometimes you need a monster to beat a monster. Let's be clear tobiramas mistakes fucked up the entire ninja world not just the leaf. Hiruzen never did anything half as harmful as creating the reanimation jutsu. Also keep in mind that not killing orochimaru was kind of like not killing gollum in lord of the rings he ends up doing good in the end lol.",

That's why Naruto needs Sasuke. \n\nThis is also a world were every old person was at one time a child soldier this is an extremely violent place we are talking about. Kids are trained to kill at the age of like 6 or 7 so get over it I guess. Watch the first big fight in Naruto. Zabuza a fan favorite uses a little boy as his tool in a very inappropriate relationship. This is the process of a violent treacherous world slowly becoming less violent and treacherous another theme in the show. The leaders are trying to make sense of a terrible world without a guide book.

You don't really read the manga properly. \nThe Hokage **election** is sort of democratical. Since the both the Jonin and the Fire Lord **must** approve the candidate.\nOnce the Hokage is elected, he very much is a dictator. \nHashirama **was not a Hokage** when he tried to make Madara one, there was no Hokage by then.\n\n\n\n\n>Danzo did not have his station until his death.\n\nExcept he was?? He was still one of the elders and he still controlled Root.\n\n\n\n\n>Hiruzen couldn't have known he was still fucking with the foundation because everyone in the foundation had a silence curse mark on them.\n\nHe did know lol.

You don't really read the manga properly. \nThe Hokage **election** is sort of democratical. Since the both the Jonin and the Fire Lord **must** approve the candidate.\nOnce the Hokage is elected, he very much is a dictator. \nHashirama **was not a Hokage** when he tried to make Madara one, there was no Hokage by then.\n\n\n\n\n>Danzo did not have his station until his death.\n\nExcept he was??

That's why Naruto needs Sasuke. \n\nThis is also a world were every old person was at one time a child soldier this is an extremely violent place we are talking about. Kids are trained to kill at the age of like 6 or 7 so get over it I guess. Watch the first big fight in Naruto. Zabuza a fan favorite uses a little boy as his tool in a very inappropriate relationship. This is the process of a violent treacherous world slowly becoming less violent and treacherous another theme in the show.

The moment he actually might try, he realizes that he can't actually.\n\n\n\n\n>The massive army didn't have shit to do with chunin exams or anbu his contributions.

In the streets??\nAre you actually trying to argue that there's no correlation between the schools and military institutions Tobirama created and later everyone would replicate...

Did the Uchiha ever once talk to the hokage about their displeasure not that I know of they just got pissed and started plotting a coup",
