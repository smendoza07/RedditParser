Thank you again for the great strength you guys have sent me during a new start.\n\nIt's a little embarrassing, but\u2026 I\u2019ve decided to donate all (except a small production fee) the proceeds, from the five videos I\u2019ve uploaded this month. (I don\u2019t think the views will continue to be this high from now on). \n\nThis was not just my own achievement but was possible through all of your support, so I thought it would be meaningful for all of us to see how our love for workout leads to more good influences.  \n\nYou all took part in this donation, so please feel proud of yourselves, and continue to work out healthily!  \n\nThank you.\n\nTranslation by: [OneKJK](https://www.instagram.com/onekjk/)",
