    "body": "I just had a tonsillectomy today and a week ago I asked my SD if he could pick me up from the hospital as they wouldn\u2019t release me without a ride home from someone I know. So an Uber/taxi was off the table. Not only did he put aside his usual plans to agree to pick me up but he also offered to stay with me and bring me there. He got me pure honey when I had said I forgot to grab it myself along with chicken and beef broth. He paid for my meds even though I had my debit card out, ready to pay for them myself. The kindness and compassion this man has shown towards me is worth more than any money he could provide me with. I truly adore him and am so thankful to have him in my life, even if it may not be for a long time I will always cherish him and the time we spend together.  It\u2019s nice to feel genuinely cared for instead of just a piece of meat. \ud83e\udd70\ud83d\ude0d\u2764\ufe0f",

Yeah, I am tired of feeling used and it\u2019s not just guys who have done it but friends. I would rather have no one in my life if it means feeling this way but he puts in the effort to give me what I need emotionally even though I have never told him that about myself. He is a real man though and the thing I adore about him is that he has respect for his ex wife. They are like best friends and clearly ended amicably. I think that\u2019s a positive role model for his teenage boys he helps raise. Ohh I definitely did, I was thanking him all day and kissing him, putting my head on his arm/shoulder. When I heal I know of other ways I am going to thank him \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude08 hahaha. Thank you so much !",

My friend sent me home in one by myself and when I thought I didn\u2019t pay I called the taxi company all worried the next day but they said it was taken care of and my friend said she paid for me. Some taxi and Uber drivers will take advantage of you if they can, you never know. I will never know if that dude did but based on not feeling weird down there the next day I doubt it. Another friend of mine was drunk before but still aware of her surroundings and the taxi driver had the nerve to bring her back to his apartment instead of where she lived and tried to get her to drink with him. He kept telling her to put her phone away so when she got to his apartment used the bathroom and told her friend to call the cops, they traced the guy and called him telling him to bring her to the station ASAP, mind you this was a grown ass man and she was 17 at the time. These people can be predatory and sorry for going on but I am glad the hospital takes precautions like that. Besides, I was being taken care of, why would I want to leave ? Haha",

I think that\u2019s a positive role model for his teenage boys he helps raise. Ohh I definitely did, I was thanking him all day and kissing him, putting my head on his arm/shoulder.

Some taxi and Uber drivers will take advantage of you if they can, you never know. I will never know if that dude did but based on not feeling weird down there the next day I doubt it. Another friend of mine was drunk before but still aware of her surroundings and the taxi driver had the nerve to bring her back to his apartment instead of where she lived and tried to get her to drink with him. He kept telling her to put her phone away so when she got to his apartment used the bathroom and told her friend to call the cops, they traced the guy and called him telling him to bring her to the station ASAP, mind you this was a grown ass man and she was 17 at the time. These people can be predatory and sorry for going on but I am glad the hospital takes precautions like that. Besides, I was being taken care of, why would I want to leave ? Haha",
