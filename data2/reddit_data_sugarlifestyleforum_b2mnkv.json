    "body": "Recap: a few weeks ago I received a text message on my private unpublished cell phone which referenced this sub and my sugar lifestyle and made a veiled threat to \u2018out\u2019 me. Not wanting to take chances, I nuked my Reddit profile and handed everything over to a private investigator. \n\nUpdate: It was my newest SB\u2019s brother. \n\nShe had confided in him about what she was doing. He didn\u2019t approve and says he wanted to frighten me off, but in actuality he wanted a payoff. He snooped her phone and got my info. \n\nMy PI strung him along, feigning fear and wanting to do whatever we can to \u2018keep this quiet\u2019. Eventually got enough information to identify him and then confronted him with two off duty cops (who conveniently had not yet changed out of uniform). He was persuaded to stop, no second chances. \n\nI revealed it to her, she seemed legit shocked and angry, and they both insist she was not involved. She also beat the ever loving shit out of him. But I\u2019m still a bit leary. If she wasn\u2019t so amazing I\u2019d drop her in a second, just to be safe, but she engages me in thoughtful conversation unlike anyone I\u2019ve ever met.\n\nThank you all for the replies and PMs of support, and ideas on how to proceed. It\u2019s great to be a part of a community that takes care of one another.\n\n\n",
