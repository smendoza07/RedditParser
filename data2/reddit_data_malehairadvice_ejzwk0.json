You have fantastic wavy hair.\n\nYou have a bit of a Timothee Chalamet vibe, especially in the lower right pic.\n\nHave you ever moved you part over to the  left more?  It's an easy not cut change to try for something different. \n\nJust keep it trimmed it you like this length.  \n\nI'd suggest checking out the r/curlyhair sub?",
