And by majority, I mean when she initially started charging it she was using so much chakra at all times (even while sleeping, side note) that she would struggle to go on \u2018long walks\u2019. It was stated to take 3 years of stored chakra just to make it appear in the first place. And while I agree it was moderately convenient for it to appear DURING the war, it did still require that time to charge. \n\nFor context, this means that while fighting Sasori and during Pain\u2019s attack, Sakura was INSANELY nerfed and had she stopped charging the seal (it\u2019s never explained what would happen but I assume she never stopped because if she did she wouldn\u2019t be able to make it happen again) she likely could\u2019ve mid-low diffed Sasori and been a massive problem for Pain.\n\nAnd Katsuyu is simple. She made a summoning contract with her, but during the war Katsuyu says she relies on the power of the Byakugo seal to work, meaning Sakura couldn\u2019t use her until she had it too.",

If anything, Sakura is mid-high Kage level with the Byakugo seal going by databooks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd it would be FAR more than twice the speed. Her power level goes from this [https://cm.blazefast.co/c7/6d/c76d77d58c728ae8455bc4f8787c5dbd.jpg](https://cm.blazefast.co/c7/6d/c76d77d58c728ae8455bc4f8787c5dbd.jpg) (note the size of this explosion in relation to her body) to this [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Di-GfkNUYAAbnaa.jpg](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Di-GfkNUYAAbnaa.jpg) . It is fairly hard to tell because Sakura herself is \\*too small to be visible in this image of the explosion\\* but if you look closely into the middle, you can see various circles, notable for being the biggest of the 10 tails summons. Here is what they look like in relation to Sakura. [https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Naruto/0632-017.png](https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Naruto/0632-017.png) So it should be quite plainly obvious that Sakura's power level has increased by a pretty incredulous amount. And her speed went from being whatever it was at the start to her being considered on this level as well, so it did have to increase massively. After all, no matter how strong you are if you're too slow to land an attack your strength is useless, but it was made quite clear she was not in that situation until Six Paths tier enemies began appearing.",

This is blatantly obvious by him being able to keep up with Kakashi, who is high jonin low kage level. He was losing so he's not equal, but he was keeping up with him. If both of them were hardly chunin level, then them having the ability to beat Kakashi would once again downplay the power of every character by making people that are low kage level susceptible to chunins, it just makes all the power levels in the verse weird as hell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou need to remember that on Naruto's first missions he was fighting the Sanin and the Akatsuki. Orochimaru is the strongest of the Sanin and easily Kage level while all members of the Akatsuki are stated in the Databooks to be Bijuu level, including Hidan. Bijuu level, by the way, is nearly the same as Kage level. In fact, there are some bijuu who are outright stronger than some of the Kage. So once again, for Naruto and Sakura to only be chunin level and able to even exist on the same level of fight as these people is simply ludicrous and almost contradictory to how power levels have worked in Naruto. While sometimes a weaker character can win, the power difference between a chunin and Orochimaru or a chunin and Deidara or a chunin and Sasori is just too much to overcome.",

Physically he could be at the level of a low jounin but he's clearly lacking in every other area. \n\nIt's not like Sakura solo'd Sasori. She worked in conjunction with a much stronger ninja and played her part in the fight. \n\nNaruto accomplished nothing vs deidara or orochimaru without the Ninetails chakra taking over. You can't really call that his power at that point since he loses control. When he encounters Sasuke (someone who's actually at jounin level) he is powerless. It's embarrassing how much stronger Sasuke is than him.\n\nNaruto is much stronger by the time he fights Kakuzu. To get to that level took intense training only he could do because of his stamina. By the end of it Yamato calls him a completely new ninja or something to emphasize how much he's changed.

Between the start of Shippudden and the Kakuzu fight Kakashi went under no significant training, so he himself was easily on the level of a mid-high tier Akatsuki member. Considering Naruto and Sakura wound up needing help and one of them couldn't even beat the Akatsuki member (read: Bijuu/Kage level ninja) they were fighting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSasuke himself is also very arguably high-end Jonin level. Think about it, he's able to handle Orochimaru even when he uses his forms where he is less inhibited by sickness like the giant snake, and he shows changes in chakra shape that even Orochimaru wasn't prepared for (that lightning sword). So honestly you could make a solid case for him being low-Kage level, which is further supported by him being able to take on Deidara who beat Gaara, an actual kage. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTyping that, I realize that Sasuke is just actually Kage level. He literally beat a guy that beat a kage after all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're right, Rasenshuriken Training Naruto is MUCH stronger than he was at the start and actually on the level of Akatsuki members, whom I remind you are Bijuu - Kage level. In particular, anyone stronger than Deidara (this includes Sasori and Kakuzu) are objectively Kage level, since they're stronger than a Kage buster.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo summarize since I've connected some more dots while typing this: Sasuke, Kakashi, Sasori, Deidara, and Kakuzu are all Kage level to some extent. They may not be the strongest Kage level, but they're definitely on that level. I don't think you need me to explain that most of them would probably beat Mei, though she's a particularly weak Kage so that means little. And that would also support low-mid jonin Naruto and Sakura.",

I don't think there are any at the start of Shippuden. Same goes for Sakura.\n\nSasuke himself states that Orochimaru was heavily weakened when he beat him.  Implying that he was still significantly weaker than Orochimaru at the time. I'd put him as a strong to elite jounin not quite as strong as kakashi but strong enough to give him a lot of trouble. The difference in level between him and Naruto when they first meet is immense. Way too much to consider them even remotely in the same class of ninja.",

Kabuto, who knew how weakened Orochimaru was even after getting sick, was still shitting himself when he saw what Sasuke did. If Orochimaru had weakened past Kabuto's level (and thus Kakashi's level at least going by Part 1) then Kabuto would have been MUCH less surprised and scared. But that's irrelevant to Naruto and Sakura, who were in fact able to either keep up with, press, or scare the shit out of Kakashi.",

And, referring back to the overall point, if she wasn't charging the Byakugo she absolutely would've been at minimum near the top of Jonin tier though I still think she would've been around Kage level.",

The other three guys at their peaks are damn near on god level, Even Kakashi with dms...\nThats what bothers me. Give her a good character. If needed give her some training episodes, some goals, Even some hax powers... Just get her close to her team in terms of accomplishments or anything really. As a complete side character she would be fine. As the part of the Team seven, packed with god reincarnations, while those guys have amazing backstories, pain, and development? Its not enough... Just lazy... Thats why shes hated on.",

Like how if you punch a hard wall you feel it more than if you punch a pillow, the limbo clone wouldn't budge an inch so Guy would probably just collapse into the clone and become a pile of mushy Guy Goo on the ground due to all that force suddenly stopping at once.",

Remember when she punched the Hiruko shell and his heart came out? Imagine what would've happened to it if she was dozens if not more than a hundred times stronger. Because if you compare the size of the explosions made by her punches, that's about the difference.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd even if Sasori survived that punch, since Sakura had both an antidote to his poison and was learning how he fought fast enough that after a very very short window of time was able to handle him on her own, having War Arc level speed would allow her to just overpower him.",

Even if it was the heart that came out he effortlessly transfered it to another puppet so I don't think it was a problem for him. And this was only possible with Chiyo's help anyway. Sakura on her own lacks speed and any diversionary tactics or jutsu to gain an advantage and get in for the kill. She's just raw power. \n\nHer only combat achievements are beating up mindless 10 tails fission beings and getting carried by Chiyo against Sasori.

However, both by scaring the everliving shit out if Naruto, keeping up with him and Sasuke numerous times, and the Databooks, we have conclusive evidence she was KCM level. And the only difference between her Sasori fight self and 4th war self was her putting most of her chakra in the Byakugo, so I am saying if she stopped charging it she would become KCM level even at the start if Shippudden.\n\nImagine it like this: Since ninja use chakra for nearly everything, not having access to it weakens the person significantly. Sakura had to deal with that and train her body to manage under those conditions, so when she regained full access to her chakra her unmatched levels of chakra control essentially made her a monster in the basics. Ninja can put chakra into their legs to move faster, Sakura can move faster with less chakra than normal people. Her strength is especially amped because CES (her and Tsunade\u2019s ability to hit really hard) specifically explains to be stronger with better chakra control. So imagine Sakura is like Rock Lee with chakra that amps his stats more than usual. If Rock Lee had massive stores of chakra that he could use for Gates like effects without gates, how strong do you think he would be?",

Yet, to disregard what others did because apparently Sakura was the only one who worked hard and everyone else got their powers handed out to them, like the OP means, is plain stupid.\n\nSakura is a medical prodigy, for me however, she has done nothing to surpass Tsunade because pure skills wise, Tsunade has changed the entire medical structure of the Ninja world and Sakura has just learned from her and not made any new innovations. This just means that Sakura is not on the same level as Tsunade, not that she is in anyway a bad Medic, infact she maybe second best.\n\nWhat I meant was, if Sasuke had only made Raikiri better and not shown any unique Jutsu, I would have called him inferior to Kakashi in lightning usage. HOWEVER, Sasuke has shown the capability to adapt to the circumstances ,and use lightning release in various different ways. Naruto also improved on the learning of Rasengan and ADDED something to it while training hard.  Had he only used all of Jiraiya's techniques and none of his own, even if had used them better, I would have called him to not be in the same skill level as Jiraiya, why? Because actually coming up with stuff when the resources are limited requires way more talent and hard work than to learn it from an expert and copy-paste.\n\nThat is the difference between a chef who can pull-off the dishes when the ingredients are missing and innovate to make something new and another great chef who follows the recipe.\n\nWhat had Sakura created? She uses CES (Tsunade's creation) and Hundred Healing (again Tsunade's creation), I would have considered her a greater medical genius than Tsunade if she showed medical aptitude beyond what Tsunade created, Sakura was an excellent user of medical ninjutsu, yet she did nothing to surpass Tsunade.",

But she did work hard too. Just not in the way that I see so many Sakura fans say.), you guys get angry. \n\nSmh.

It\u2019s just that you\u2019re just oddly aggressive. I was actively trying to downplay Sakura cause her excellent chakra control doesn\u2019t mean shit to other broken abilities but apparently that means I\u2019m trying to follow some agenda made by the Sakura fans lmao. \n\nAnyways, from the start it just looked like you were nitpicking a specific part instead of looking at the big picture. Naruto and Sasuke\u2019s abilities are fucking broken. You even say that they shouldn\u2019t be compared to Sakura because only past quarter otsutsuki reincarnates are comparable to them. THATS THE FUCKING POINT! THOSE TWO HAVE BUSTED ASS ABILITIES AND EXCELLENT CHAKRA CONTROL AINT GOT SHIT! Sure, she had that at the start of the show but it doesn\u2019t hold a fucking candle to the other shit. \n\nAlso you never really answered it, how many times does it reference the excellent chakra control? Just as much as kuruma? Or the sharingan? Is it as important as those two? The answer is probably no. So it just isn\u2019t that important. She had that ability, I\u2019ll give you that. But if that ability was never written in the story, I wouldn\u2019t think it would change Sakura at all. Lol.",

The only reason the Sage shows up in front of Naruto is because Naruto was able to acquire chakra from all Nine Tailed Beasts which summoned him. So unless you want to argue that Naruto never had to get strong to do that I think we're done here. Also, the only reason the Sage gave them powers is because of the threat of Kaguya. He didn't give it to him just because they had his sons' chakra signatures.\n\nAs for Neji, what was he right about? That destiny is a real thing? Yeah nobody ever said it wasn't. What Naruto argued is that your destiny is something you choose and he proved that every step of the way throughout the story.",

And we can't talk about narrative guarantee because that's the writers choice. We can only talk about what could and what is.  \n Otherwise i could say the same about Sakura, Like she had a narrative guarantee to be the strongest female ninja in Konoha and become a Sanin and all the power she got instead of someone like idk Tenten or Ino.",

It took Naruto years to get to that level to do so. Imagine ignoring all of the hours of training Naruto took to improve himself being invalidated about a special \"hand out\" that he was given that he himself had to earn to right to use. \n\nHell, that right there isn't a hand out. The fact Naruto HAD to not only acquire the strength but also the right to have Kurama cooperate with him shows that this is anything but a handout. \n\nSix paths power was a hand out though.",

Yes, he had benefits from the kyuubi but that doesn't magically negate the hard work he put in.\n\nTo even use the kyuubi's chakra he had to work his ass off to become strong enough to fight Kyuubi to have KCM. It took Naruto working hard to become a sage. It took Naruto hard work to get where he was at the war arc before six path bs.\n\nIf you think Naruto could get strong without hard work, then you think he could've just sat down everyday doing nothing but eat ramen all day and still become strong.",

He trained in the toad mountains and earned the power of a sage. Eventuallya t war arc is where he acquired kuramas full powers without suffering harm in the process. \n\nSasuke was born with tye sharingan. Its hereditary. That rinnegqn is technically hereditary as well as only a user of the mangekyo or eternal mangekyo can acquire it. But before the rinnegan, buddy trained hard to develop his sharingan into a mangekyo, then used itachis eyes to acquire Eternal Mangekyo. He surpassed kage level far before he even got the eternal mangekyo alone. Guy took on 5 kages and their henchman alone. Suigetsu and jugo and karin were basically useless in thought battles. He even dare i say, won. They couldnt capture and kill him, he forced Raikage to sever his arm and accept death by going for an all out last resort attack on his amaterasu encased susanoo. Whereby, he killed danzo shortly after. Their power gained solely by training far surpassed anything sakura has amounted to, respectfully. Naruto at pain arc is stronger than boruto sakura. And boruto sakura is hella strong. Sasuke at 5 kage summit is stronger than boruto sakura as well. Forget about Kcm + Sosp   + Baryon Mode Naruto. Forget about 6 Tomoe Rinnegan Sasuke. Were talking sage mode naruto and Mengekyo sasuke.\n\nKakashi. He was gifted a 1 tomoe sharingan. But far before that, at the age of 11 he was gien the title of Jonin and made into anbu the moment obito was thought to have died. Kakashi at 11 and 12 being jonin worked immensly hard for thise skills. This kid was on high level missions constantly. He surpassed about 90% of jonins in konoha at the age of 11. It was after he acquired sharingan that he became far morw formidable. Eventually he trained that sharingan to acquire more tomoes and he acquired mangekyo upon rins death. Never had handouts. Worked for everything he was worth before he even obtained the sharingan. He was keeping pace with minato in training even.",

After getting his lungs torn out by sasuke he was back soon anyway because kuramas healing supplements normal healing even when fully sealed. It's definitely a fucking handout. No one had such advantages. That helped him train 10x of anyone cause he fucking recovers with barely any rest. Can Sakura do that?? No one can other than jinchurikis. Plus got a gift from ninja christ to activate sage of six paths mode.\n\n\nNow Sasuke. The sharingan is a handout. It's a bloody hax eyes. It can basically do anything. Grants you a photographic memory, prediction, copying moves. A little more trauma, you can light inextinguishable black flames from thin air, can form a body suit from your eyes that rivals fucking tailed beasts in power. Oh the best part about this, you can cheat your own death twice. Who gets so many born benefits? At the end ninja christ gave him a god level eye in the rinnegan. \n\nThese 2 got these gifts because they were bloody demigod incarnates. Compared to a normal human, yes it's bloody unfair advantage these 2 have. No one can come close with their born advantages. Don't be stupid.",

She literally brings nothing new to the table like Sasuke and Naruto both do.\n\nNaruto takes nature energy to a whole new level compared to Jirya, even mastering the scrolls his former master could not. Making techniques never used, seen or practiced before and reaching whole new heights of mastery.\n\nSasuke takes his lightning techniques and training from kikashi, then his training and boosts from Orochimaru and still, doesn't even resemble either of them even slightly. He takes there knowledge but he uses for HIS style HIS techniques and HIS preferences!\n\nAll Sakura does is mimic her teacher. That's it. Nothing new. No techniques she comes up with.

But yall will just ignore that. \n\nAnd sasuke, he already trained a bit before the massacre the man learned fire release at 7 which is supposed to be a jonin level feat, but yall ignore that, and didn't sasuke also know  2different fire jutsus like the Phoenix flower and dragon flame jutsu, he had shuriken and taijutsu training, but yall ignore that too and pass it off as indra and ashura Chakra for some reason, the man trained with kakashi and learned chidori used his sharingan to copy lees taijutsu and worked hard to get It, went off to orochimaru learned 3 different shape transformations for the chidori and created kirin something kakashi never did, learned Kenjutsu trained and mastered his curse mark which is why he didn't get paralyzed when he was still using it, mastered his sharingan to the point where he could break out of tsukuyomi and etc... But keep on hating on the 2 main characters. \n\nLet me remind ya'll that sakura had better Chakra control then the both of them, she was so good she mastered the byakugou seal in just 3 years when shizune someone who trained with tsunade for so long couldn't even do it, little to no one can do what sakura can, not ino or hinata, and sasukes sharingan is his genetics just like the 8 gates is in everybody's genetics, the boy had to go through multiple traumatic experiences to get them and had to fight itachi to the death for his eyes, the 5 kage, danzo and kakashi to get all the stages of susano'o, and had to nearly die to get hagoromos Chakra this post isn't facts its just ignorant.",

Guilt, fear, pain, determination. All this, while Sakura is simping, and beating up a kinda weak Akatsuki member. Thats all she did in the whole show except bonking Kaguya in the head once. While both three got immense abilities handed over to them, let it be DMS, Rinnegan, or SO6P, we've seen them truly work and train and suffer. Kakashi's MS was literally the symbol of his pain and suffering. And so, those are not only deserved, but very cool, and heart warming for me of some kind.\nYou could also say that Hinata did even less but guess what: She's a full on side character, and she wasn't an arrogant b*tsh to our loved MC, and she didnt have her whole team stacking godlike powers while she's still on the level of Pain arc Naruto at almost the beginning of the show.\nIf Sakura would've been even a bit remotely close to what the other three has accomplished, let it be as a character or as in strength, i'd be the first person to have some sympathy towards her. Also ill never forget how she lied to Naruto, about loving him, so he doesn't go after Sasuke, and lied to Sasuke so she can kill him.\nThat shows us how impactless, and yes, ill say it: Useless her character design was, so even if she lies to her TEAMMATES she cant do anything about them, cant stop or change their minds. What does she do about it? nothing. Whining and gathering chakra so she's beefier, and maybe she could put up a fight against Naruto 430 episode earlier.\n So yes. That's why she's hated, and in my opinion, its a deserved hate.",

Now wtf did sakura go through. Also let's not forget that naruto and saduke had to train a lot more and harder than she did. Especially naruto since most his life the 9 tails was messing with his chakra making it very difficult for him to do anything.

Like her being weaker than her teammates & having self-esteem issue certainly make sense, such a character especially when being written as female & the main character on top of that requires nuance tho, it's too easy for such a charcter to fall in damsel in distress or girl/lamp tropes and that is what ended up happening in the anime, like she did get some arc but she got mary sued for the most of it cuz mostly the writer either didn't know how to right female characters, weaker characters or both, they literally wrote her as just a side piece despite keep alluding to the fact that she was part of the triage and she still could have been a worthwile main part of the trio despite her lack of strength if they have actually for a while actually focused on her as a character. It was always going to be just naruto/sasuke & all the other lore, stories & characters of the series got side-tracked for that.",

And by majority, I mean when she initially started charging it she was using so much chakra at all times (even while sleeping, side note) that she would struggle to go on \u2018long walks\u2019. It was stated to take 3 years of stored chakra just to make it appear in the first place. And while I agree it was moderately convenient for it to appear DURING the war, it did still require that time to charge. \n\nFor context, this means that while fighting Sasori and during Pain\u2019s attack, Sakura was INSANELY nerfed and had she stopped charging the seal (it\u2019s never explained what would happen but I assume she never stopped because if she did she wouldn\u2019t be able to make it happen again) she likely could\u2019ve mid-low diffed Sasori and been a massive problem for Pain.\n\nAnd Katsuyu is simple. She made a summoning contract with her, but during the war Katsuyu says she relies on the power of the Byakugo seal to work, meaning Sakura couldn\u2019t use her until she had it too.",

It's fine if it's your headcanon, I just disagree because if something that major happened it would've been mentioned.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd yeah I guess it's not outside the realm, but I just think it feels weird for that to be the case since it once again detracts from Sakura's abilities which is what Kishimoto was trying NOT to do at that point since he needed to force her to be strong for story reasons.",

It is fairly hard to tell because Sakura herself is \\*too small to be visible in this image of the explosion\\* but if you look closely into the middle, you can see various circles, notable for being the biggest of the 10 tails summons. Here is what they look like in relation to Sakura.

And her speed went from being whatever it was at the start to her being considered on this level as well, so it did have to increase massively. After all, no matter how strong you are if you're too slow to land an attack your strength is useless, but it was made quite clear she was not in that situation until Six Paths tier enemies began appearing.",

This is blatantly obvious by him being able to keep up with Kakashi, who is high jonin low kage level. He was losing so he's not equal, but he was keeping up with him. If both of them were hardly chunin level, then them having the ability to beat Kakashi would once again downplay the power of every character by making people that are low kage level susceptible to chunins, it just makes all the power levels in the verse weird as hell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou need to remember that on Naruto's first missions he was fighting the Sanin and the Akatsuki. Orochimaru is the strongest of the Sanin and easily Kage level while all members of the Akatsuki are stated in the Databooks to be Bijuu level, including Hidan. Bijuu level, by the way, is nearly the same as Kage level. In fact, there are some bijuu who are outright stronger than some of the Kage. So once again, for Naruto and Sakura to only be chunin level and able to even exist on the same level of fight as these people is simply ludicrous and almost contradictory to how power levels have worked in Naruto. While sometimes a weaker character can win, the power difference between a chunin and Orochimaru or a chunin and Deidara or a chunin and Sasori is just too much to overcome.",

Kakashi was able to fend then off 1v2 in the training exercise playing defense only without to much trouble. He caught up to Naruto easily when they were chasing deidara and was able to seal guess power when he went berserk. Naruto only made an impact when he let the Ninetails take control. Physically he could be at the level of a low jounin but he's clearly lacking in every other area. \n\nIt's not like Sakura solo'd Sasori. She worked in conjunction with a much stronger ninja and played her part in the fight. \n\nNaruto accomplished nothing vs deidara or orochimaru without the Ninetails chakra taking over. You can't really call that his power at that point since he loses control. When he encounters Sasuke (someone who's actually at jounin level) he is powerless. It's embarrassing how much stronger Sasuke is than him.\n\nNaruto is much stronger by the time he fights Kakuzu. To get to that level took intense training only he could do because of his stamina. By the end of it Yamato calls him a completely new ninja or something to emphasize how much he's changed. It's not until this point that Naruto becomes an actual strong ninja capable of fighting on his own.",

Between the start of Shippudden and the Kakuzu fight Kakashi went under no significant training, so he himself was easily on the level of a mid-high tier Akatsuki member. Considering Naruto and Sakura wound up needing help and one of them couldn't even beat the Akatsuki member (read: Bijuu/Kage level ninja) they were fighting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSasuke himself is also very arguably high-end Jonin level. Think about it, he's able to handle Orochimaru even when he uses his forms where he is less inhibited by sickness like the giant snake, and he shows changes in chakra shape that even Orochimaru wasn't prepared for (that lightning sword). So honestly you could make a solid case for him being low-Kage level, which is further supported by him being able to take on Deidara who beat Gaara, an actual kage. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTyping that, I realize that Sasuke is just actually Kage level. He literally beat a guy that beat a kage after all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're right, Rasenshuriken Training Naruto is MUCH stronger than he was at the start and actually on the level of Akatsuki members, whom I remind you are Bijuu - Kage level. In particular, anyone stronger than Deidara (this includes Sasori and Kakuzu) are objectively Kage level, since they're stronger than a Kage buster.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo summarize since I've connected some more dots while typing this: Sasuke, Kakashi, Sasori, Deidara, and Kakuzu are all Kage level to some extent. They may not be the strongest Kage level, but they're definitely on that level. I don't think you need me to explain that most of them would probably beat Mei, though she's a particularly weak Kage so that means little. And that would also support low-mid jonin Naruto and Sakura.",

And, referring back to the overall point, if she wasn't charging the Byakugo she absolutely would've been at minimum near the top of Jonin tier though I still think she would've been around Kage level.",

The other three guys at their peaks are damn near on god level, Even Kakashi with dms...\nThats what bothers me. Give her a good character. If needed give her some training episodes, some goals, Even some hax powers... Just get her close to her team in terms of accomplishments or anything really. As a complete side character she would be fine. As the part of the Team seven, packed with god reincarnations, while those guys have amazing backstories, pain, and development? Its not enough... Just lazy... Thats why shes hated on.",

The shockwave and air also aren't major factors because they would be FAR weaker than the strike itself, especially if Madara is behind the clone because the force would get blocked by said clone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo essentially, a Limbo could 100% block a punch with a shockwave and the air force, and unless it was an OPM situation where Saitama is Large Planet level to his opponents continent level, the shockwaves and air force will not be enough to do anything relevant.",

Like how if you punch a hard wall you feel it more than if you punch a pillow, the limbo clone wouldn't budge an inch so Guy would probably just collapse into the clone and become a pile of mushy Guy Goo on the ground due to all that force suddenly stopping at once.",

[https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EuzHtTUXcAE04fo.jpg](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EuzHtTUXcAE04fo.jpg)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd for that claim about Sakura being a match for Sasori, consider that from the start of Shippudden to the war she has not gone under much notable intensive training (aside from possibly the Sasori fight), and yet she still went from being the weakest member of the group by far to on the level of KCM1.5 (Mastered KCM1) Naruto and EMS Sasuke according to the databooks [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/842208769110310922/842209695627870238/Sakura\\_Scaling\\_with\\_markings.jpg](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/842208769110310922/842209695627870238/Sakura_Scaling_with_markings.jpg) The red circle specifically applied to base Byakugo, where she is simply using her own no longer limited chakra and not the chakra stored in the seal. In other words, start of Shippudden Sakura would (if she wasn't nerfing herself) have been the strongest of the three, but she also would not have been able to scale into any stronger forms.",

Remember when she punched the Hiruko shell and his heart came out? Imagine what would've happened to it if she was dozens if not more than a hundred times stronger. Because if you compare the size of the explosions made by her punches, that's about the difference.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd even if Sasori survived that punch, since Sakura had both an antidote to his poison and was learning how he fought fast enough that after a very very short window of time was able to handle him on her own, having War Arc level speed would allow her to just overpower him.",

She's definitely not funneling 99 percent of her chakra into her forehead so she's not getting 100x stronger. I think you're wildly overestimating both her speed and how much chakra is being funneled. \n\nI'm confident it was Sasori the human puppet that came out of hiruko not his flesh heart. Even if it was the heart that came out he effortlessly transfered it to another puppet so I don't think it was a problem for him. And this was only possible with Chiyo's help anyway. Sakura on her own lacks speed and any diversionary tactics or jutsu to gain an advantage and get in for the kill. She's just raw power. \n\nHer only combat achievements are beating up mindless 10 tails fission beings and getting carried by Chiyo against Sasori. And Sasori even let himself like she for sentimental reasons.",

On top of that, the abilities Sakura has (Chakra Enhanced Strength and 100 Healings) are both Kage level abilities stressing the need for \\*PRODIGAL\\* chakra control. Like, Shizune the apprentice of Tsunade for years and arguably another of the best medical ninja in the world was incapable of using them.

However, both by scaring the everliving shit out if Naruto, keeping up with him and Sasuke numerous times, and the Databooks, we have conclusive evidence she was KCM level. And the only difference between her Sasori fight self and 4th war self was her putting most of her chakra in the Byakugo, so I am saying if she stopped charging it she would become KCM level even at the start if Shippudden.\n\nImagine it like this: Since ninja use chakra for nearly everything, not having access to it weakens the person significantly. Sakura had to deal with that and train her body to manage under those conditions, so when she regained full access to her chakra her unmatched levels of chakra control essentially made her a monster in the basics. Ninja can put chakra into their legs to move faster, Sakura can move faster with less chakra than normal people. Her strength is especially amped because CES (her and Tsunade\u2019s ability to hit really hard) specifically explains to be stronger with better chakra control. So imagine Sakura is like Rock Lee with chakra that amps his stats more than usual. If Rock Lee had massive stores of chakra that he could use for Gates like effects without gates, how strong do you think he would be?",

Yet, to disregard what others did because apparently Sakura was the only one who worked hard and everyone else got their powers handed out to them, like the OP means, is plain stupid.\n\nSakura is a medical prodigy, for me however, she has done nothing to surpass Tsunade because pure skills wise, Tsunade has changed the entire medical structure of the Ninja world and Sakura has just learned from her and not made any new innovations. This just means that Sakura is not on the same level as Tsunade, not that she is in anyway a bad Medic, infact she maybe second best.\n\nWhat I meant was, if Sasuke had only made Raikiri better and not shown any unique Jutsu, I would have called him inferior to Kakashi in lightning usage. HOWEVER, Sasuke has shown the capability to adapt to the circumstances ,and use lightning release in various different ways. Naruto also improved on the learning of Rasengan and ADDED something to it while training hard.  Had he only used all of Jiraiya's techniques and none of his own, even if had used them better, I would have called him to not be in the same skill level as Jiraiya, why? Because actually coming up with stuff when the resources are limited requires way more talent and hard work than to learn it from an expert and copy-paste.\n\nThat is the difference between a chef who can pull-off the dishes when the ingredients are missing and innovate to make something new and another great chef who follows the recipe.\n\nWhat had Sakura created? She uses CES (Tsunade's creation) and Hundred Healing (again Tsunade's creation), I would have considered her a greater medical genius than Tsunade if she showed medical aptitude beyond what Tsunade created, Sakura was an excellent user of medical ninjutsu, yet she did nothing to surpass Tsunade.",

(well maybe she can have 100 seal thing bring in nature chakra instead of hers.) \n\nalso I never disregarded what others did. I was just stating that nothing was handed to her.

So unless you want to argue that Naruto never had to get strong to do that I think we're done here. Also, the only reason the Sage gave them powers is because of the threat of Kaguya. He didn't give it to him just because they had his sons' chakra signatures.\n\nAs for Neji, what was he right about? That destiny is a real thing? Yeah nobody ever said it wasn't. What Naruto argued is that your destiny is something you choose and he proved that every step of the way throughout the story.",

Then we learn the Uzumakis were op, his dad is the 4th hokage, the 9 tails becomes his primary power, and then destiny is his ultimate power up.\n\nSasuke \"learning\" rock Lee's speed is literally an example of hard work being overrated.

But the biggest advantage is super healing. Like after Final Valley the dude got his lungs torn out. Just a lil visit to the hospital and he's fine for training again.

Which are literally just Kurama super sayian boosts lol. \n\nAnd those boots even don't make sense at all. It makes no sense that the nine tails who is relevant to Kage level characters itself at 100% somehow boosts Naruto this much. KCM was believable scale wise to how much it boosted him but KCM 2 not really lol then counting Boruto Baryon mode hell no lol. A kage level tailed beast boosts him to wrecking the strongest Otsustuki lol.",

After getting his lungs torn out by sasuke he was back soon anyway because kuramas healing supplements normal healing even when fully sealed. It's definitely a fucking handout. No one had such advantages. That helped him train 10x of anyone cause he fucking recovers with barely any rest. Can Sakura do that?? No one can other than jinchurikis. Plus got a gift from ninja christ to activate sage of six paths mode.\n\n\nNow Sasuke. The sharingan is a handout. It's a bloody hax eyes. It can basically do anything. Grants you a photographic memory, prediction, copying moves. A little more trauma, you can light inextinguishable black flames from thin air, can form a body suit from your eyes that rivals fucking tailed beasts in power. Oh the best part about this, you can cheat your own death twice. Who gets so many born benefits? At the end ninja christ gave him a god level eye in the rinnegan. \n\nThese 2 got these gifts because they were bloody demigod incarnates.

If anything, Sakura is mid-high Kage level with the Byakugo seal going by databooks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd it would be FAR more than twice the speed. Her power level goes from this [https://cm.blazefast.co/c7/6d/c76d77d58c728ae8455bc4f8787c5dbd.jpg](https://cm.blazefast.co/c7/6d/c76d77d58c728ae8455bc4f8787c5dbd.jpg) (note the size of this explosion in relation to her body) to this [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Di-GfkNUYAAbnaa.jpg](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Di-GfkNUYAAbnaa.jpg) . It is fairly hard to tell because Sakura herself is \\*too small to be visible in this image of the explosion\\* but if you look closely into the middle, you can see various circles, notable for being the biggest of the 10 tails summons. Here is what they look like in relation to Sakura. [https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Naruto/0632-017.png](https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Naruto/0632-017.png) So it should be quite plainly obvious that Sakura's power level has increased by a pretty incredulous amount. And her speed went from being whatever it was at the start to her being considered on this level as well, so it did have to increase massively. After all, no matter how strong you are if you're too slow to land an attack your strength is useless, but it was made quite clear she was not in that situation until Six Paths tier enemies began appearing.",

This is blatantly obvious by him being able to keep up with Kakashi, who is high jonin low kage level. He was losing so he's not equal, but he was keeping up with him. If both of them were hardly chunin level, then them having the ability to beat Kakashi would once again downplay the power of every character by making people that are low kage level susceptible to chunins, it just makes all the power levels in the verse weird as hell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou need to remember that on Naruto's first missions he was fighting the Sanin and the Akatsuki. Orochimaru is the strongest of the Sanin and easily Kage level while all members of the Akatsuki are stated in the Databooks to be Bijuu level, including Hidan. Bijuu level, by the way, is nearly the same as Kage level. In fact, there are some bijuu who are outright stronger than some of the Kage. So once again, for Naruto and Sakura to only be chunin level and able to even exist on the same level of fight as these people is simply ludicrous and almost contradictory to how power levels have worked in Naruto. While sometimes a weaker character can win, the power difference between a chunin and Orochimaru or a chunin and Deidara or a chunin and Sasori is just too much to overcome.",

Physically he could be at the level of a low jounin but he's clearly lacking in every other area. \n\nIt's not like Sakura solo'd Sasori. She worked in conjunction with a much stronger ninja and played her part in the fight. \n\nNaruto accomplished nothing vs deidara or orochimaru without the Ninetails chakra taking over. You can't really call that his power at that point since he loses control. When he encounters Sasuke (someone who's actually at jounin level) he is powerless. It's embarrassing how much stronger Sasuke is than him.\n\nNaruto is much stronger by the time he fights Kakuzu. To get to that level took intense training only he could do because of his stamina. By the end of it Yamato calls him a completely new ninja or something to emphasize how much he's changed. It's not until this point that Naruto becomes an actual strong ninja capable of fighting on his own.",

Between the start of Shippudden and the Kakuzu fight Kakashi went under no significant training, so he himself was easily on the level of a mid-high tier Akatsuki member. Considering Naruto and Sakura wound up needing help and one of them couldn't even beat the Akatsuki member (read: Bijuu/Kage level ninja) they were fighting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSasuke himself is also very arguably high-end Jonin level. Think about it, he's able to handle Orochimaru even when he uses his forms where he is less inhibited by sickness like the giant snake, and he shows changes in chakra shape that even Orochimaru wasn't prepared for (that lightning sword). So honestly you could make a solid case for him being low-Kage level, which is further supported by him being able to take on Deidara who beat Gaara, an actual kage. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTyping that, I realize that Sasuke is just actually Kage level. He literally beat a guy that beat a kage after all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're right, Rasenshuriken Training Naruto is MUCH stronger than he was at the start and actually on the level of Akatsuki members, whom I remind you are Bijuu - Kage level. In particular, anyone stronger than Deidara (this includes Sasori and Kakuzu) are objectively Kage level, since they're stronger than a Kage buster.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo summarize since I've connected some more dots while typing this: Sasuke, Kakashi, Sasori, Deidara, and Kakuzu are all Kage level to some extent. They may not be the strongest Kage level, but they're definitely on that level. I don't think you need me to explain that most of them would probably beat Mei, though she's a particularly weak Kage so that means little. And that would also support low-mid jonin Naruto and Sakura.",

And I don't have a hard list of every jonin ever to give you names, but what it comes down to at least for Sakura is that she literally became a Jonin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd even the weakened Orochimaru was still a terror. Kabuto, who knew how weakened Orochimaru was even after getting sick, was still shitting himself when he saw what Sasuke did. If Orochimaru had weakened past Kabuto's level (and thus Kakashi's level at least going by Part 1) then Kabuto would have been MUCH less surprised and scared. But that's irrelevant to Naruto and Sakura, who were in fact able to either keep up with, press, or scare the shit out of Kakashi.",

She's a lot stronger at the end of the series! She trained hard, gained experience and mastered the 100 healings jutsu as well as summoning. We might not have seen her training first hand but it's not like she curled up into the fetal position while she wasn't on screen. \n\nKakashi was just testing their growth. He wasn't trying to beat them. It makes zero sense to say they were even with kakashi but helpless against Sasuke. \n\nKabuto was extra shook because his entire identity was being Orochimaru's right hand man.

And, referring back to the overall point, if she wasn't charging the Byakugo she absolutely would've been at minimum near the top of Jonin tier though I still think she would've been around Kage level.",

The other three guys at their peaks are damn near on god level, Even Kakashi with dms...\nThats what bothers me. Give her a good character. If needed give her some training episodes, some goals, Even some hax powers... Just get her close to her team in terms of accomplishments or anything really. As a complete side character she would be fine. As the part of the Team seven, packed with god reincarnations, while those guys have amazing backstories, pain, and development? Its not enough... Just lazy... Thats why shes hated on.",

First, Sasori wasn't serious at the start, and second, the sheer area her punch can cover means that in that first punch she likely would destroy Sasori's flesh heart. Remember when she punched the Hiruko shell and his heart came out? Imagine what would've happened to it if she was dozens if not more than a hundred times stronger. Because if you compare the size of the explosions made by her punches, that's about the difference.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd even if Sasori survived that punch, since Sakura had both an antidote to his poison and was learning how he fought fast enough that after a very very short window of time was able to handle him on her own, having War Arc level speed would allow her to just overpower him.",

She's definitely not funneling 99 percent of her chakra into her forehead so she's not getting 100x stronger. I think you're wildly overestimating both her speed and how much chakra is being funneled. \n\nI'm confident it was Sasori the human puppet that came out of hiruko not his flesh heart. Even if it was the heart that came out he effortlessly transfered it to another puppet so I don't think it was a problem for him. And this was only possible with Chiyo's help anyway. Sakura on her own lacks speed and any diversionary tactics or jutsu to gain an advantage and get in for the kill. She's just raw power. \n\nHer only combat achievements are beating up mindless 10 tails fission beings and getting carried by Chiyo against Sasori. And Sasori even let himself like she for sentimental reasons.",

On top of that, the abilities Sakura has (Chakra Enhanced Strength and 100 Healings) are both Kage level abilities stressing the need for \\*PRODIGAL\\* chakra control. Like, Shizune the apprentice of Tsunade for years and arguably another of the best medical ninja in the world was incapable of using them.

However, both by scaring the everliving shit out if Naruto, keeping up with him and Sasuke numerous times, and the Databooks, we have conclusive evidence she was KCM level. And the only difference between her Sasori fight self and 4th war self was her putting most of her chakra in the Byakugo, so I am saying if she stopped charging it she would become KCM level even at the start if Shippudden.\n\nImagine it like this: Since ninja use chakra for nearly everything, not having access to it weakens the person significantly. Sakura had to deal with that and train her body to manage under those conditions, so when she regained full access to her chakra her unmatched levels of chakra control essentially made her a monster in the basics. Ninja can put chakra into their legs to move faster, Sakura can move faster with less chakra than normal people. Her strength is especially amped because CES (her and Tsunade\u2019s ability to hit really hard) specifically explains to be stronger with better chakra control. So imagine Sakura is like Rock Lee with chakra that amps his stats more than usual. If Rock Lee had massive stores of chakra that he could use for Gates like effects without gates, how strong do you think he would be?",

People saying that Sakura is a medical prodigy greater than Tsunade sounds like cap to me simply because everything she used was INVENTED BY and taught to her by Tsunade.\n\nIt's like saying today's scientists are greater than Einstein just because they can make more effective nuclear bombs.

Yet, to disregard what others did because apparently Sakura was the only one who worked hard and everyone else got their powers handed out to them, like the OP means, is plain stupid.\n\nSakura is a medical prodigy, for me however, she has done nothing to surpass Tsunade because pure skills wise, Tsunade has changed the entire medical structure of the Ninja world and Sakura has just learned from her and not made any new innovations. This just means that Sakura is not on the same level as Tsunade, not that she is in anyway a bad Medic, infact she maybe second best.\n\nWhat I meant was, if Sasuke had only made Raikiri better and not shown any unique Jutsu, I would have called him inferior to Kakashi in lightning usage. HOWEVER, Sasuke has shown the capability to adapt to the circumstances ,and use lightning release in various different ways. Naruto also improved on the learning of Rasengan and ADDED something to it while training hard.  Had he only used all of Jiraiya's techniques and none of his own, even if had used them better, I would have called him to not be in the same skill level as Jiraiya, why? Because actually coming up with stuff when the resources are limited requires way more talent and hard work than to learn it from an expert and copy-paste.\n\nThat is the difference between a chef who can pull-off the dishes when the ingredients are missing and innovate to make something new and another great chef who follows the recipe.\n\nWhat had Sakura created? She uses CES (Tsunade's creation) and Hundred Healing (again Tsunade's creation), I would have considered her a greater medical genius than Tsunade if she showed medical aptitude beyond what Tsunade created, Sakura was an excellent user of medical ninjutsu, yet she did nothing to surpass Tsunade.",

Naruto and Sasuke\u2019s abilities are fucking broken. You even say that they shouldn\u2019t be compared to Sakura because only past quarter otsutsuki reincarnates are comparable to them. THATS THE FUCKING POINT! THOSE TWO HAVE BUSTED ASS ABILITIES AND EXCELLENT CHAKRA CONTROL AINT GOT SHIT! Sure, she had that at the start of the show but it doesn\u2019t hold a fucking candle to the other shit. \n\nAlso you never really answered it, how many times does it reference the excellent chakra control? Just as much as kuruma? Or the sharingan? Is it as important as those two? The answer is probably no. So it just isn\u2019t that important. She had that ability, I\u2019ll give you that.

Plus you\u2019re talking as if she was a god at chakra control when she was above average in the beginning of the series , the only thing she got the hang of naturally was climbing trees and walking on water which is a skill easily obtained by all ninjas. After that point she still had to train hard to improve her chakra control in order to do the stuff that she\u2019s capable of doing, not to mention she trained under one of the Sanin and learned techniques that required an even more extensive proficiency in chakra control so it all adds up. Was she talented in Chakra control absolutely but she still had to train a shit ton to get to the point where she\u2019s at now.",

She definitely is nowhere near Kage level, as she's basically the weaker version of tsunade, one of the weakest kages, but it's unfair to act like she doesn't at least deserve to be on a team. She could probably do at least somewhat decently on a balanced team, but compared to the rest of team 7, she really is useless.",

So unless you want to argue that Naruto never had to get strong to do that I think we're done here. Also, the only reason the Sage gave them powers is because of the threat of Kaguya. He didn't give it to him just because they had his sons' chakra signatures.\n\nAs for Neji, what was he right about? That destiny is a real thing? Yeah nobody ever said it wasn't. What Naruto argued is that your destiny is something you choose and he proved that every step of the way throughout the story.",

Naruto had uzumaki genes which granted more chakra than anyone. Filled with the occasional tailed beast chakra healing you. The dude could train way harder than anyone and be fine the next day. Sure tailed beats have disadvantages like horrible social life. But the biggest advantage is super healing. Like after Final Valley the dude got his lungs torn out. Just a lil visit to the hospital and he's fine for training again. Like Sasuke had such an injury he would have been out for a few years.\n\nHonestly Rock Lee and Might Guy training at their levels without some hack abilities is a testament to them.",

And we can't talk about narrative guarantee because that's the writers choice. We can only talk about what could and what is.  \n Otherwise i could say the same about Sakura, Like she had a narrative guarantee to be the strongest female ninja in Konoha and become a Sanin and all the power she got instead of someone like idk Tenten or Ino.",

If anything, Sakura is mid-high Kage level with the Byakugo seal going by databooks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd it would be FAR more than twice the speed. Her power level goes from this [https://cm.blazefast.co/c7/6d/c76d77d58c728ae8455bc4f8787c5dbd.jpg](https://cm.blazefast.co/c7/6d/c76d77d58c728ae8455bc4f8787c5dbd.jpg) (note the size of this explosion in relation to her body) to this [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Di-GfkNUYAAbnaa.jpg](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Di-GfkNUYAAbnaa.jpg) . It is fairly hard to tell because Sakura herself is \\*too small to be visible in this image of the explosion\\* but if you look closely into the middle, you can see various circles, notable for being the biggest of the 10 tails summons. Here is what they look like in relation to Sakura. [https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Naruto/0632-017.png](https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Naruto/0632-017.png) So it should be quite plainly obvious that Sakura's power level has increased by a pretty incredulous amount. And her speed went from being whatever it was at the start to her being considered on this level as well, so it did have to increase massively. After all, no matter how strong you are if you're too slow to land an attack your strength is useless, but it was made quite clear she was not in that situation until Six Paths tier enemies began appearing.",

This is blatantly obvious by him being able to keep up with Kakashi, who is high jonin low kage level. He was losing so he's not equal, but he was keeping up with him. If both of them were hardly chunin level, then them having the ability to beat Kakashi would once again downplay the power of every character by making people that are low kage level susceptible to chunins, it just makes all the power levels in the verse weird as hell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou need to remember that on Naruto's first missions he was fighting the Sanin and the Akatsuki. Orochimaru is the strongest of the Sanin and easily Kage level while all members of the Akatsuki are stated in the Databooks to be Bijuu level, including Hidan. Bijuu level, by the way, is nearly the same as Kage level. In fact, there are some bijuu who are outright stronger than some of the Kage. So once again, for Naruto and Sakura to only be chunin level and able to even exist on the same level of fight as these people is simply ludicrous and almost contradictory to how power levels have worked in Naruto. While sometimes a weaker character can win, the power difference between a chunin and Orochimaru or a chunin and Deidara or a chunin and Sasori is just too much to overcome.",

Kakashi was able to fend then off 1v2 in the training exercise playing defense only without to much trouble. He caught up to Naruto easily when they were chasing deidara and was able to seal guess power when he went berserk. Naruto only made an impact when he let the Ninetails take control. Physically he could be at the level of a low jounin but he's clearly lacking in every other area. \n\nIt's not like Sakura solo'd Sasori. She worked in conjunction with a much stronger ninja and played her part in the fight. \n\nNaruto accomplished nothing vs deidara or orochimaru without the Ninetails chakra taking over. You can't really call that his power at that point since he loses control. When he encounters Sasuke (someone who's actually at jounin level) he is powerless. It's embarrassing how much stronger Sasuke is than him.\n\nNaruto is much stronger by the time he fights Kakuzu. To get to that level took intense training only he could do because of his stamina. By the end of it Yamato calls him a completely new ninja or something to emphasize how much he's changed. It's not until this point that Naruto becomes an actual strong ninja capable of fighting on his own.",

Between the start of Shippudden and the Kakuzu fight Kakashi went under no significant training, so he himself was easily on the level of a mid-high tier Akatsuki member. Considering Naruto and Sakura wound up needing help and one of them couldn't even beat the Akatsuki member (read: Bijuu/Kage level ninja) they were fighting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSasuke himself is also very arguably high-end Jonin level. Think about it, he's able to handle Orochimaru even when he uses his forms where he is less inhibited by sickness like the giant snake, and he shows changes in chakra shape that even Orochimaru wasn't prepared for (that lightning sword). So honestly you could make a solid case for him being low-Kage level, which is further supported by him being able to take on Deidara who beat Gaara, an actual kage. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTyping that, I realize that Sasuke is just actually Kage level. He literally beat a guy that beat a kage after all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're right, Rasenshuriken Training Naruto is MUCH stronger than he was at the start and actually on the level of Akatsuki members, whom I remind you are Bijuu - Kage level. In particular, anyone stronger than Deidara (this includes Sasori and Kakuzu) are objectively Kage level, since they're stronger than a Kage buster.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo summarize since I've connected some more dots while typing this: Sasuke, Kakashi, Sasori, Deidara, and Kakuzu are all Kage level to some extent. They may not be the strongest Kage level, but they're definitely on that level. I don't think you need me to explain that most of them would probably beat Mei, though she's a particularly weak Kage so that means little. And that would also support low-mid jonin Naruto and Sakura.",

She's a lot stronger at the end of the series! She trained hard, gained experience and mastered the 100 healings jutsu as well as summoning. We might not have seen her training first hand but it's not like she curled up into the fetal position while she wasn't on screen. \n\nKakashi was just testing their growth. He wasn't trying to beat them. It makes zero sense to say they were even with kakashi but helpless against Sasuke. \n\nKabuto was extra shook because his entire identity was being Orochimaru's right hand man. I don't think he was capable of imagining a reality without Orochimaru around.",

And, referring back to the overall point, if she wasn't charging the Byakugo she absolutely would've been at minimum near the top of Jonin tier though I still think she would've been around Kage level.",

Like how if you punch a hard wall you feel it more than if you punch a pillow, the limbo clone wouldn't budge an inch so Guy would probably just collapse into the clone and become a pile of mushy Guy Goo on the ground due to all that force suddenly stopping at once.",

[https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EuzHtTUXcAE04fo.jpg](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EuzHtTUXcAE04fo.jpg)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd for that claim about Sakura being a match for Sasori, consider that from the start of Shippudden to the war she has not gone under much notable intensive training (aside from possibly the Sasori fight), and yet she still went from being the weakest member of the group by far to on the level of KCM1.5 (Mastered KCM1) Naruto and EMS Sasuke according to the databooks [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/842208769110310922/842209695627870238/Sakura\\_Scaling\\_with\\_markings.jpg](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/842208769110310922/842209695627870238/Sakura_Scaling_with_markings.jpg) The red circle specifically applied to base Byakugo, where she is simply using her own no longer limited chakra and not the chakra stored in the seal. In other words, start of Shippudden Sakura would (if she wasn't nerfing herself) have been the strongest of the three, but she also would not have been able to scale into any stronger forms.",

First, Sasori wasn't serious at the start, and second, the sheer area her punch can cover means that in that first punch she likely would destroy Sasori's flesh heart. Remember when she punched the Hiruko shell and his heart came out? Imagine what would've happened to it if she was dozens if not more than a hundred times stronger. Because if you compare the size of the explosions made by her punches, that's about the difference.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd even if Sasori survived that punch, since Sakura had both an antidote to his poison and was learning how he fought fast enough that after a very very short window of time was able to handle him on her own, having War Arc level speed would allow her to just overpower him.",

She's definitely not funneling 99 percent of her chakra into her forehead so she's not getting 100x stronger. I think you're wildly overestimating both her speed and how much chakra is being funneled. \n\nI'm confident it was Sasori the human puppet that came out of hiruko not his flesh heart. Even if it was the heart that came out he effortlessly transfered it to another puppet so I don't think it was a problem for him. And this was only possible with Chiyo's help anyway. Sakura on her own lacks speed and any diversionary tactics or jutsu to gain an advantage and get in for the kill. She's just raw power. \n\nHer only combat achievements are beating up mindless 10 tails fission beings and getting carried by Chiyo against Sasori.

However, both by scaring the everliving shit out if Naruto, keeping up with him and Sasuke numerous times, and the Databooks, we have conclusive evidence she was KCM level. And the only difference between her Sasori fight self and 4th war self was her putting most of her chakra in the Byakugo, so I am saying if she stopped charging it she would become KCM level even at the start if Shippudden.\n\nImagine it like this: Since ninja use chakra for nearly everything, not having access to it weakens the person significantly. Sakura had to deal with that and train her body to manage under those conditions, so when she regained full access to her chakra her unmatched levels of chakra control essentially made her a monster in the basics. Ninja can put chakra into their legs to move faster, Sakura can move faster with less chakra than normal people. Her strength is especially amped because CES (her and Tsunade\u2019s ability to hit really hard) specifically explains to be stronger with better chakra control. So imagine Sakura is like Rock Lee with chakra that amps his stats more than usual. If Rock Lee had massive stores of chakra that he could use for Gates like effects without gates, how strong do you think he would be?",

Yet, to disregard what others did because apparently Sakura was the only one who worked hard and everyone else got their powers handed out to them, like the OP means, is plain stupid.\n\nSakura is a medical prodigy, for me however, she has done nothing to surpass Tsunade because pure skills wise, Tsunade has changed the entire medical structure of the Ninja world and Sakura has just learned from her and not made any new innovations. This just means that Sakura is not on the same level as Tsunade, not that she is in anyway a bad Medic, infact she maybe second best.\n\nWhat I meant was, if Sasuke had only made Raikiri better and not shown any unique Jutsu, I would have called him inferior to Kakashi in lightning usage. HOWEVER, Sasuke has shown the capability to adapt to the circumstances ,and use lightning release in various different ways. Naruto also improved on the learning of Rasengan and ADDED something to it while training hard.  Had he only used all of Jiraiya's techniques and none of his own, even if had used them better, I would have called him to not be in the same skill level as Jiraiya, why? Because actually coming up with stuff when the resources are limited requires way more talent and hard work than to learn it from an expert and copy-paste.\n\nThat is the difference between a chef who can pull-off the dishes when the ingredients are missing and innovate to make something new and another great chef who follows the recipe.\n\nWhat had Sakura created? She uses CES (Tsunade's creation) and Hundred Healing (again Tsunade's creation), I would have considered her a greater medical genius than Tsunade if she showed medical aptitude beyond what Tsunade created, Sakura was an excellent user of medical ninjutsu, yet she did nothing to surpass Tsunade.",

Naruto and Sasuke\u2019s abilities are fucking broken. You even say that they shouldn\u2019t be compared to Sakura because only past quarter otsutsuki reincarnates are comparable to them. THATS THE FUCKING POINT! THOSE TWO HAVE BUSTED ASS ABILITIES AND EXCELLENT CHAKRA CONTROL AINT GOT SHIT! Sure, she had that at the start of the show but it doesn\u2019t hold a fucking candle to the other shit. \n\nAlso you never really answered it, how many times does it reference the excellent chakra control? Just as much as kuruma? Or the sharingan? Is it as important as those two? The answer is probably no. So it just isn\u2019t that important. She had that ability, I\u2019ll give you that.

The only reason the Sage shows up in front of Naruto is because Naruto was able to acquire chakra from all Nine Tailed Beasts which summoned him. So unless you want to argue that Naruto never had to get strong to do that I think we're done here. Also, the only reason the Sage gave them powers is because of the threat of Kaguya. He didn't give it to him just because they had his sons' chakra signatures.\n\nAs for Neji, what was he right about? That destiny is a real thing? Yeah nobody ever said it wasn't. What Naruto argued is that your destiny is something you choose and he proved that every step of the way throughout the story.",

Yes, he had benefits from the kyuubi but that doesn't magically negate the hard work he put in.\n\nTo even use the kyuubi's chakra he had to work his ass off to become strong enough to fight Kyuubi to have KCM. It took Naruto working hard to become a sage. It took Naruto hard work to get where he was at the war arc before six path bs.\n\nIf you think Naruto could get strong without hard work, then you think he could've just sat down everyday doing nothing but eat ramen all day and still become strong.",

If anything, Sakura is mid-high Kage level with the Byakugo seal going by databooks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd it would be FAR more than twice the speed. Her power level goes from this [https://cm.blazefast.co/c7/6d/c76d77d58c728ae8455bc4f8787c5dbd.jpg](https://cm.blazefast.co/c7/6d/c76d77d58c728ae8455bc4f8787c5dbd.jpg) (note the size of this explosion in relation to her body) to this [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Di-GfkNUYAAbnaa.jpg](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Di-GfkNUYAAbnaa.jpg) . It is fairly hard to tell because Sakura herself is \\*too small to be visible in this image of the explosion\\* but if you look closely into the middle, you can see various circles, notable for being the biggest of the 10 tails summons. Here is what they look like in relation to Sakura. [https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Naruto/0632-017.png](https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Naruto/0632-017.png) So it should be quite plainly obvious that Sakura's power level has increased by a pretty incredulous amount. And her speed went from being whatever it was at the start to her being considered on this level as well, so it did have to increase massively. After all, no matter how strong you are if you're too slow to land an attack your strength is useless, but it was made quite clear she was not in that situation until Six Paths tier enemies began appearing.",

If both of them were hardly chunin level, then them having the ability to beat Kakashi would once again downplay the power of every character by making people that are low kage level susceptible to chunins, it just makes all the power levels in the verse weird as hell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou need to remember that on Naruto's first missions he was fighting the Sanin and the Akatsuki. Orochimaru is the strongest of the Sanin and easily Kage level while all members of the Akatsuki are stated in the Databooks to be Bijuu level, including Hidan. Bijuu level, by the way, is nearly the same as Kage level. In fact, there are some bijuu who are outright stronger than some of the Kage. So once again, for Naruto and Sakura to only be chunin level and able to even exist on the same level of fight as these people is simply ludicrous and almost contradictory to how power levels have worked in Naruto. While sometimes a weaker character can win, the power difference between a chunin and Orochimaru or a chunin and Deidara or a chunin and Sasori is just too much to overcome.",

Kakashi was able to fend then off 1v2 in the training exercise playing defense only without to much trouble. He caught up to Naruto easily when they were chasing deidara and was able to seal guess power when he went berserk. Naruto only made an impact when he let the Ninetails take control. Physically he could be at the level of a low jounin but he's clearly lacking in every other area. \n\nIt's not like Sakura solo'd Sasori. She worked in conjunction with a much stronger ninja and played her part in the fight. \n\nNaruto accomplished nothing vs deidara or orochimaru without the Ninetails chakra taking over. You can't really call that his power at that point since he loses control. When he encounters Sasuke (someone who's actually at jounin level) he is powerless. It's embarrassing how much stronger Sasuke is than him.\n\nNaruto is much stronger by the time he fights Kakuzu. To get to that level took intense training only he could do because of his stamina. By the end of it Yamato calls him a completely new ninja or something to emphasize how much he's changed. It's not until this point that Naruto becomes an actual strong ninja capable of fighting on his own.",

Between the start of Shippudden and the Kakuzu fight Kakashi went under no significant training, so he himself was easily on the level of a mid-high tier Akatsuki member. Considering Naruto and Sakura wound up needing help and one of them couldn't even beat the Akatsuki member (read: Bijuu/Kage level ninja) they were fighting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSasuke himself is also very arguably high-end Jonin level. Think about it, he's able to handle Orochimaru even when he uses his forms where he is less inhibited by sickness like the giant snake, and he shows changes in chakra shape that even Orochimaru wasn't prepared for (that lightning sword). So honestly you could make a solid case for him being low-Kage level, which is further supported by him being able to take on Deidara who beat Gaara, an actual kage. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTyping that, I realize that Sasuke is just actually Kage level. He literally beat a guy that beat a kage after all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're right, Rasenshuriken Training Naruto is MUCH stronger than he was at the start and actually on the level of Akatsuki members, whom I remind you are Bijuu - Kage level. In particular, anyone stronger than Deidara (this includes Sasori and Kakuzu) are objectively Kage level, since they're stronger than a Kage buster.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo summarize since I've connected some more dots while typing this: Sasuke, Kakashi, Sasori, Deidara, and Kakuzu are all Kage level to some extent. They may not be the strongest Kage level, but they're definitely on that level. I don't think you need me to explain that most of them would probably beat Mei, though she's a particularly weak Kage so that means little. And that would also support low-mid jonin Naruto and Sakura.",

And, referring back to the overall point, if she wasn't charging the Byakugo she absolutely would've been at minimum near the top of Jonin tier though I still think she would've been around Kage level.",

And even if some of the air force got past, it would be heavily reduced and nowhere near enough to severely damage Madara at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was thinking about this more, and if anything the force of the attack would likely reflect on guy. Like how if you punch a hard wall you feel it more than if you punch a pillow, the limbo clone wouldn't budge an inch so Guy would probably just collapse into the clone and become a pile of mushy Guy Goo on the ground due to all that force suddenly stopping at once.",

Remember when she punched the Hiruko shell and his heart came out? Imagine what would've happened to it if she was dozens if not more than a hundred times stronger. Because if you compare the size of the explosions made by her punches, that's about the difference.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd even if Sasori survived that punch, since Sakura had both an antidote to his poison and was learning how he fought fast enough that after a very very short window of time was able to handle him on her own, having War Arc level speed would allow her to just overpower him.",

Even if it was the heart that came out he effortlessly transfered it to another puppet so I don't think it was a problem for him. And this was only possible with Chiyo's help anyway. Sakura on her own lacks speed and any diversionary tactics or jutsu to gain an advantage and get in for the kill. She's just raw power. \n\nHer only combat achievements are beating up mindless 10 tails fission beings and getting carried by Chiyo against Sasori.

However, both by scaring the everliving shit out if Naruto, keeping up with him and Sasuke numerous times, and the Databooks, we have conclusive evidence she was KCM level. And the only difference between her Sasori fight self and 4th war self was her putting most of her chakra in the Byakugo, so I am saying if she stopped charging it she would become KCM level even at the start if Shippudden.\n\nImagine it like this: Since ninja use chakra for nearly everything, not having access to it weakens the person significantly. Sakura had to deal with that and train her body to manage under those conditions, so when she regained full access to her chakra her unmatched levels of chakra control essentially made her a monster in the basics. Ninja can put chakra into their legs to move faster, Sakura can move faster with less chakra than normal people. Her strength is especially amped because CES (her and Tsunade\u2019s ability to hit really hard) specifically explains to be stronger with better chakra control. So imagine Sakura is like Rock Lee with chakra that amps his stats more than usual. If Rock Lee had massive stores of chakra that he could use for Gates like effects without gates, how strong do you think he would be?",

Yet, to disregard what others did because apparently Sakura was the only one who worked hard and everyone else got their powers handed out to them, like the OP means, is plain stupid.\n\nSakura is a medical prodigy, for me however, she has done nothing to surpass Tsunade because pure skills wise, Tsunade has changed the entire medical structure of the Ninja world and Sakura has just learned from her and not made any new innovations. This just means that Sakura is not on the same level as Tsunade, not that she is in anyway a bad Medic, infact she maybe second best.\n\nWhat I meant was, if Sasuke had only made Raikiri better and not shown any unique Jutsu, I would have called him inferior to Kakashi in lightning usage. HOWEVER, Sasuke has shown the capability to adapt to the circumstances ,and use lightning release in various different ways. Naruto also improved on the learning of Rasengan and ADDED something to it while training hard.  Had he only used all of Jiraiya's techniques and none of his own, even if had used them better, I would have called him to not be in the same skill level as Jiraiya, why? Because actually coming up with stuff when the resources are limited requires way more talent and hard work than to learn it from an expert and copy-paste.\n\nThat is the difference between a chef who can pull-off the dishes when the ingredients are missing and innovate to make something new and another great chef who follows the recipe.\n\nWhat had Sakura created? She uses CES (Tsunade's creation) and Hundred Healing (again Tsunade's creation), I would have considered her a greater medical genius than Tsunade if she showed medical aptitude beyond what Tsunade created, Sakura was an excellent user of medical ninjutsu, yet she did nothing to surpass Tsunade.",

But she did work hard too. Just not in the way that I see so many Sakura fans say.), you guys get angry. \n\nSmh.

Just as much as kuruma? Or the sharingan? Is it as important as those two? The answer is probably no. So it just isn\u2019t that important. She had that ability, I\u2019ll give you that.

She definitely is nowhere near Kage level, as she's basically the weaker version of tsunade, one of the weakest kages, but it's unfair to act like she doesn't at least deserve to be on a team. She could probably do at least somewhat decently on a balanced team, but compared to the rest of team 7, she really is useless.",

So unless you want to argue that Naruto never had to get strong to do that I think we're done here. Also, the only reason the Sage gave them powers is because of the threat of Kaguya. He didn't give it to him just because they had his sons' chakra signatures.\n\nAs for Neji, what was he right about? That destiny is a real thing? Yeah nobody ever said it wasn't. What Naruto argued is that your destiny is something you choose and he proved that every step of the way throughout the story.",

Naruto could train many times faster because he could use his clones to master techniques in a fraction of the time, all thanks to the Kyuubi\n\nSo Naruto never worked hard? Yes, he had benefits from the kyuubi but that doesn't magically negate the hard work he put in.\n\nTo even use the kyuubi's chakra he had to work his ass off to become strong enough to fight Kyuubi to have KCM. It took Naruto working hard to become a sage. It took Naruto hard work to get where he was at the war arc before six path bs.\n\nIf you think Naruto could get strong without hard work, then you think he could've just sat down everyday doing nothing but eat ramen all day and still become strong.",

[https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Naruto/0632-017.png](https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Naruto/0632-017.png) So it should be quite plainly obvious that Sakura's power level has increased by a pretty incredulous amount. And her speed went from being whatever it was at the start to her being considered on this level as well, so it did have to increase massively. After all, no matter how strong you are if you're too slow to land an attack your strength is useless, but it was made quite clear she was not in that situation until Six Paths tier enemies began appearing.",

This is blatantly obvious by him being able to keep up with Kakashi, who is high jonin low kage level. He was losing so he's not equal, but he was keeping up with him. If both of them were hardly chunin level, then them having the ability to beat Kakashi would once again downplay the power of every character by making people that are low kage level susceptible to chunins, it just makes all the power levels in the verse weird as hell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou need to remember that on Naruto's first missions he was fighting the Sanin and the Akatsuki. Orochimaru is the strongest of the Sanin and easily Kage level while all members of the Akatsuki are stated in the Databooks to be Bijuu level, including Hidan. Bijuu level, by the way, is nearly the same as Kage level. In fact, there are some bijuu who are outright stronger than some of the Kage. So once again, for Naruto and Sakura to only be chunin level and able to even exist on the same level of fight as these people is simply ludicrous and almost contradictory to how power levels have worked in Naruto. While sometimes a weaker character can win, the power difference between a chunin and Orochimaru or a chunin and Deidara or a chunin and Sasori is just too much to overcome.",

Physically he could be at the level of a low jounin but he's clearly lacking in every other area. \n\nIt's not like Sakura solo'd Sasori. She worked in conjunction with a much stronger ninja and played her part in the fight. \n\nNaruto accomplished nothing vs deidara or orochimaru without the Ninetails chakra taking over. You can't really call that his power at that point since he loses control. When he encounters Sasuke (someone who's actually at jounin level) he is powerless. It's embarrassing how much stronger Sasuke is than him.\n\nNaruto is much stronger by the time he fights Kakuzu. To get to that level took intense training only he could do because of his stamina. By the end of it Yamato calls him a completely new ninja or something to emphasize how much he's changed.

Between the start of Shippudden and the Kakuzu fight Kakashi went under no significant training, so he himself was easily on the level of a mid-high tier Akatsuki member. Considering Naruto and Sakura wound up needing help and one of them couldn't even beat the Akatsuki member (read: Bijuu/Kage level ninja) they were fighting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSasuke himself is also very arguably high-end Jonin level. Think about it, he's able to handle Orochimaru even when he uses his forms where he is less inhibited by sickness like the giant snake, and he shows changes in chakra shape that even Orochimaru wasn't prepared for (that lightning sword). So honestly you could make a solid case for him being low-Kage level, which is further supported by him being able to take on Deidara who beat Gaara, an actual kage. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTyping that, I realize that Sasuke is just actually Kage level. He literally beat a guy that beat a kage after all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're right, Rasenshuriken Training Naruto is MUCH stronger than he was at the start and actually on the level of Akatsuki members, whom I remind you are Bijuu - Kage level. In particular, anyone stronger than Deidara (this includes Sasori and Kakuzu) are objectively Kage level, since they're stronger than a Kage buster.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo summarize since I've connected some more dots while typing this: Sasuke, Kakashi, Sasori, Deidara, and Kakuzu are all Kage level to some extent. They may not be the strongest Kage level, but they're definitely on that level. I don't think you need me to explain that most of them would probably beat Mei, though she's a particularly weak Kage so that means little. And that would also support low-mid jonin Naruto and Sakura.",

And I don't have a hard list of every jonin ever to give you names, but what it comes down to at least for Sakura is that she literally became a Jonin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd even the weakened Orochimaru was still a terror. Kabuto, who knew how weakened Orochimaru was even after getting sick, was still shitting himself when he saw what Sasuke did. If Orochimaru had weakened past Kabuto's level (and thus Kakashi's level at least going by Part 1) then Kabuto would have been MUCH less surprised and scared. But that's irrelevant to Naruto and Sakura, who were in fact able to either keep up with, press, or scare the shit out of Kakashi.",

He wasn't trying to beat them. It makes zero sense to say they were even with kakashi but helpless against Sasuke. \n\nKabuto was extra shook because his entire identity was being Orochimaru's right hand man.

And, referring back to the overall point, if she wasn't charging the Byakugo she absolutely would've been at minimum near the top of Jonin tier though I still think she would've been around Kage level.",

Like how if you punch a hard wall you feel it more than if you punch a pillow, the limbo clone wouldn't budge an inch so Guy would probably just collapse into the clone and become a pile of mushy Guy Goo on the ground due to all that force suddenly stopping at once.",

First, Sasori wasn't serious at the start, and second, the sheer area her punch can cover means that in that first punch she likely would destroy Sasori's flesh heart. Remember when she punched the Hiruko shell and his heart came out? Imagine what would've happened to it if she was dozens if not more than a hundred times stronger. Because if you compare the size of the explosions made by her punches, that's about the difference.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd even if Sasori survived that punch, since Sakura had both an antidote to his poison and was learning how he fought fast enough that after a very very short window of time was able to handle him on her own, having War Arc level speed would allow her to just overpower him.",

Even if it was the heart that came out he effortlessly transfered it to another puppet so I don't think it was a problem for him. And this was only possible with Chiyo's help anyway. Sakura on her own lacks speed and any diversionary tactics or jutsu to gain an advantage and get in for the kill.

On top of that, the abilities Sakura has (Chakra Enhanced Strength and 100 Healings) are both Kage level abilities stressing the need for \\*PRODIGAL\\* chakra control. Like, Shizune the apprentice of Tsunade for years and arguably another of the best medical ninja in the world was incapable of using them.

However, both by scaring the everliving shit out if Naruto, keeping up with him and Sasuke numerous times, and the Databooks, we have conclusive evidence she was KCM level. And the only difference between her Sasori fight self and 4th war self was her putting most of her chakra in the Byakugo, so I am saying if she stopped charging it she would become KCM level even at the start if Shippudden.\n\nImagine it like this: Since ninja use chakra for nearly everything, not having access to it weakens the person significantly. Sakura had to deal with that and train her body to manage under those conditions, so when she regained full access to her chakra her unmatched levels of chakra control essentially made her a monster in the basics. Ninja can put chakra into their legs to move faster, Sakura can move faster with less chakra than normal people. Her strength is especially amped because CES (her and Tsunade\u2019s ability to hit really hard) specifically explains to be stronger with better chakra control. So imagine Sakura is like Rock Lee with chakra that amps his stats more than usual. If Rock Lee had massive stores of chakra that he could use for Gates like effects without gates, how strong do you think he would be?",

THATS THE FUCKING POINT! THOSE TWO HAVE BUSTED ASS ABILITIES AND EXCELLENT CHAKRA CONTROL AINT GOT SHIT! Sure, she had that at the start of the show but it doesn\u2019t hold a fucking candle to the other shit. \n\nAlso you never really answered it, how many times does it reference the excellent chakra control? Just as much as kuruma? Or the sharingan? Is it as important as those two? The answer is probably no. So it just isn\u2019t that important. She had that ability, I\u2019ll give you that.

Plus you\u2019re talking as if she was a god at chakra control when she was above average in the beginning of the series , the only thing she got the hang of naturally was climbing trees and walking on water which is a skill easily obtained by all ninjas. After that point she still had to train hard to improve her chakra control in order to do the stuff that she\u2019s capable of doing, not to mention she trained under one of the Sanin and learned techniques that required an even more extensive proficiency in chakra control so it all adds up. Was she talented in Chakra control absolutely but she still had to train a shit ton to get to the point where she\u2019s at now.",

If anything, Sakura is mid-high Kage level with the Byakugo seal going by databooks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd it would be FAR more than twice the speed. Her power level goes from this [https://cm.blazefast.co/c7/6d/c76d77d58c728ae8455bc4f8787c5dbd.jpg](https://cm.blazefast.co/c7/6d/c76d77d58c728ae8455bc4f8787c5dbd.jpg) (note the size of this explosion in relation to her body) to this [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Di-GfkNUYAAbnaa.jpg](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Di-GfkNUYAAbnaa.jpg) . It is fairly hard to tell because Sakura herself is \\*too small to be visible in this image of the explosion\\* but if you look closely into the middle, you can see various circles, notable for being the biggest of the 10 tails summons. Here is what they look like in relation to Sakura. [https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Naruto/0632-017.png](https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Naruto/0632-017.png) So it should be quite plainly obvious that Sakura's power level has increased by a pretty incredulous amount. And her speed went from being whatever it was at the start to her being considered on this level as well, so it did have to increase massively. After all, no matter how strong you are if you're too slow to land an attack your strength is useless, but it was made quite clear she was not in that situation until Six Paths tier enemies began appearing.",

He was more of a liability than an asset on his first two missions. He's nowhere near as strong or effective as Sasuke or Sai. \n\nI would say that what Sakura contributed against Sasori is comparable to what Izumo and kotetsu managed against Hidan and Kakuzu. An asset for sure but still mostly supporting a stronger Jounin since they would have no chance solo(ignoring the hypothetical possibility that Sakura is insanely strong and hard nerfing herself)",

This is blatantly obvious by him being able to keep up with Kakashi, who is high jonin low kage level. He was losing so he's not equal, but he was keeping up with him. If both of them were hardly chunin level, then them having the ability to beat Kakashi would once again downplay the power of every character by making people that are low kage level susceptible to chunins, it just makes all the power levels in the verse weird as hell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou need to remember that on Naruto's first missions he was fighting the Sanin and the Akatsuki. Orochimaru is the strongest of the Sanin and easily Kage level while all members of the Akatsuki are stated in the Databooks to be Bijuu level, including Hidan. Bijuu level, by the way, is nearly the same as Kage level. In fact, there are some bijuu who are outright stronger than some of the Kage. So once again, for Naruto and Sakura to only be chunin level and able to even exist on the same level of fight as these people is simply ludicrous and almost contradictory to how power levels have worked in Naruto. While sometimes a weaker character can win, the power difference between a chunin and Orochimaru or a chunin and Deidara or a chunin and Sasori is just too much to overcome.",

Kakashi was able to fend then off 1v2 in the training exercise playing defense only without to much trouble.

Physically he could be at the level of a low jounin but he's clearly lacking in every other area. \n\nIt's not like Sakura solo'd Sasori. She worked in conjunction with a much stronger ninja and played her part in the fight. \n\nNaruto accomplished nothing vs deidara or orochimaru without the Ninetails chakra taking over. You can't really call that his power at that point since he loses control. When he encounters Sasuke (someone who's actually at jounin level) he is powerless. It's embarrassing how much stronger Sasuke is than him.\n\nNaruto is much stronger by the time he fights Kakuzu. To get to that level took intense training only he could do because of his stamina. By the end of it Yamato calls him a completely new ninja or something to emphasize how much he's changed. It's not until this point that Naruto becomes an actual strong ninja capable of fighting on his own.",

Between the start of Shippudden and the Kakuzu fight Kakashi went under no significant training, so he himself was easily on the level of a mid-high tier Akatsuki member. Considering Naruto and Sakura wound up needing help and one of them couldn't even beat the Akatsuki member (read: Bijuu/Kage level ninja) they were fighting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSasuke himself is also very arguably high-end Jonin level. Think about it, he's able to handle Orochimaru even when he uses his forms where he is less inhibited by sickness like the giant snake, and he shows changes in chakra shape that even Orochimaru wasn't prepared for (that lightning sword). So honestly you could make a solid case for him being low-Kage level, which is further supported by him being able to take on Deidara who beat Gaara, an actual kage. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTyping that, I realize that Sasuke is just actually Kage level. He literally beat a guy that beat a kage after all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're right, Rasenshuriken Training Naruto is MUCH stronger than he was at the start and actually on the level of Akatsuki members, whom I remind you are Bijuu - Kage level. In particular, anyone stronger than Deidara (this includes Sasori and Kakuzu) are objectively Kage level, since they're stronger than a Kage buster.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo summarize since I've connected some more dots while typing this: Sasuke, Kakashi, Sasori, Deidara, and Kakuzu are all Kage level to some extent. They may not be the strongest Kage level, but they're definitely on that level. I don't think you need me to explain that most of them would probably beat Mei, though she's a particularly weak Kage so that means little. And that would also support low-mid jonin Naruto and Sakura.",

He wasn't trying to beat them. It makes zero sense to say they were even with kakashi but helpless against Sasuke. \n\nKabuto was extra shook because his entire identity was being Orochimaru's right hand man. I don't think he was capable of imagining a reality without Orochimaru around.",

Remember when she punched the Hiruko shell and his heart came out? Imagine what would've happened to it if she was dozens if not more than a hundred times stronger. Because if you compare the size of the explosions made by her punches, that's about the difference.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd even if Sasori survived that punch, since Sakura had both an antidote to his poison and was learning how he fought fast enough that after a very very short window of time was able to handle him on her own, having War Arc level speed would allow her to just overpower him.",

Even if it was the heart that came out he effortlessly transfered it to another puppet so I don't think it was a problem for him. And this was only possible with Chiyo's help anyway. Sakura on her own lacks speed and any diversionary tactics or jutsu to gain an advantage and get in for the kill. She's just raw power. \n\nHer only combat achievements are beating up mindless 10 tails fission beings and getting carried by Chiyo against Sasori.

On top of that, the abilities Sakura has (Chakra Enhanced Strength and 100 Healings) are both Kage level abilities stressing the need for \\*PRODIGAL\\* chakra control. Like, Shizune the apprentice of Tsunade for years and arguably another of the best medical ninja in the world was incapable of using them.

Especially for one of the main group's characters, it's unlikely they'd be allowed to just come up with something about that character this is completely non-canon and contradictory to the character.",

However, both by scaring the everliving shit out if Naruto, keeping up with him and Sasuke numerous times, and the Databooks, we have conclusive evidence she was KCM level. And the only difference between her Sasori fight self and 4th war self was her putting most of her chakra in the Byakugo, so I am saying if she stopped charging it she would become KCM level even at the start if Shippudden.\n\nImagine it like this: Since ninja use chakra for nearly everything, not having access to it weakens the person significantly. Sakura had to deal with that and train her body to manage under those conditions, so when she regained full access to her chakra her unmatched levels of chakra control essentially made her a monster in the basics. Ninja can put chakra into their legs to move faster, Sakura can move faster with less chakra than normal people. Her strength is especially amped because CES (her and Tsunade\u2019s ability to hit really hard) specifically explains to be stronger with better chakra control. So imagine Sakura is like Rock Lee with chakra that amps his stats more than usual. If Rock Lee had massive stores of chakra that he could use for Gates like effects without gates, how strong do you think he would be?",

THATS THE FUCKING POINT! THOSE TWO HAVE BUSTED ASS ABILITIES AND EXCELLENT CHAKRA CONTROL AINT GOT SHIT! Sure, she had that at the start of the show but it doesn\u2019t hold a fucking candle to the other shit. \n\nAlso you never really answered it, how many times does it reference the excellent chakra control? Just as much as kuruma? Or the sharingan? Is it as important as those two? The answer is probably no. So it just isn\u2019t that important. She had that ability, I\u2019ll give you that. But if that ability was never written in the story, I wouldn\u2019t think it would change Sakura at all. Lol.",

Sakura didn't like training at first while Naruto and Sasuke were training hard even though they were already skilled genin. Sakura only showed interest in training after Sasuke left the village.",

It's fine if it's your headcanon, I just disagree because if something that major happened it would've been mentioned.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd yeah I guess it's not outside the realm, but I just think it feels weird for that to be the case since it once again detracts from Sakura's abilities which is what Kishimoto was trying NOT to do at that point since he needed to force her to be strong for story reasons.",

Her power level goes from this [https://cm.blazefast.co/c7/6d/c76d77d58c728ae8455bc4f8787c5dbd.jpg](https://cm.blazefast.co/c7/6d/c76d77d58c728ae8455bc4f8787c5dbd.jpg) (note the size of this explosion in relation to her body) to this [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Di-GfkNUYAAbnaa.jpg](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Di-GfkNUYAAbnaa.jpg) . It is fairly hard to tell because Sakura herself is \\*too small to be visible in this image of the explosion\\* but if you look closely into the middle, you can see various circles, notable for being the biggest of the 10 tails summons. Here is what they look like in relation to Sakura. [https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Naruto/0632-017.png](https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Naruto/0632-017.png) So it should be quite plainly obvious that Sakura's power level has increased by a pretty incredulous amount. And her speed went from being whatever it was at the start to her being considered on this level as well, so it did have to increase massively. After all, no matter how strong you are if you're too slow to land an attack your strength is useless, but it was made quite clear she was not in that situation until Six Paths tier enemies began appearing.",

Orochimaru is the strongest of the Sanin and easily Kage level while all members of the Akatsuki are stated in the Databooks to be Bijuu level, including Hidan. Bijuu level, by the way, is nearly the same as Kage level. In fact, there are some bijuu who are outright stronger than some of the Kage. So once again, for Naruto and Sakura to only be chunin level and able to even exist on the same level of fight as these people is simply ludicrous and almost contradictory to how power levels have worked in Naruto. While sometimes a weaker character can win, the power difference between a chunin and Orochimaru or a chunin and Deidara or a chunin and Sasori is just too much to overcome.",

Kakashi was able to fend then off 1v2 in the training exercise playing defense only without to much trouble. He caught up to Naruto easily when they were chasing deidara and was able to seal guess power when he went berserk. Naruto only made an impact when he let the Ninetails take control. Physically he could be at the level of a low jounin but he's clearly lacking in every other area. \n\nIt's not like Sakura solo'd Sasori. She worked in conjunction with a much stronger ninja and played her part in the fight. \n\nNaruto accomplished nothing vs deidara or orochimaru without the Ninetails chakra taking over. You can't really call that his power at that point since he loses control. When he encounters Sasuke (someone who's actually at jounin level) he is powerless. It's embarrassing how much stronger Sasuke is than him.\n\nNaruto is much stronger by the time he fights Kakuzu. To get to that level took intense training only he could do because of his stamina. By the end of it Yamato calls him a completely new ninja or something to emphasize how much he's changed. It's not until this point that Naruto becomes an actual strong ninja capable of fighting on his own.",

Between the start of Shippudden and the Kakuzu fight Kakashi went under no significant training, so he himself was easily on the level of a mid-high tier Akatsuki member. Considering Naruto and Sakura wound up needing help and one of them couldn't even beat the Akatsuki member (read: Bijuu/Kage level ninja) they were fighting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSasuke himself is also very arguably high-end Jonin level. Think about it, he's able to handle Orochimaru even when he uses his forms where he is less inhibited by sickness like the giant snake, and he shows changes in chakra shape that even Orochimaru wasn't prepared for (that lightning sword). So honestly you could make a solid case for him being low-Kage level, which is further supported by him being able to take on Deidara who beat Gaara, an actual kage. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTyping that, I realize that Sasuke is just actually Kage level. He literally beat a guy that beat a kage after all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're right, Rasenshuriken Training Naruto is MUCH stronger than he was at the start and actually on the level of Akatsuki members, whom I remind you are Bijuu - Kage level. In particular, anyone stronger than Deidara (this includes Sasori and Kakuzu) are objectively Kage level, since they're stronger than a Kage buster.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo summarize since I've connected some more dots while typing this: Sasuke, Kakashi, Sasori, Deidara, and Kakuzu are all Kage level to some extent. They may not be the strongest Kage level, but they're definitely on that level. I don't think you need me to explain that most of them would probably beat Mei, though she's a particularly weak Kage so that means little. And that would also support low-mid jonin Naruto and Sakura.",

Kabuto, who knew how weakened Orochimaru was even after getting sick, was still shitting himself when he saw what Sasuke did. If Orochimaru had weakened past Kabuto's level (and thus Kakashi's level at least going by Part 1) then Kabuto would have been MUCH less surprised and scared.

First, Sasori wasn't serious at the start, and second, the sheer area her punch can cover means that in that first punch she likely would destroy Sasori's flesh heart. Remember when she punched the Hiruko shell and his heart came out? Imagine what would've happened to it if she was dozens if not more than a hundred times stronger. Because if you compare the size of the explosions made by her punches, that's about the difference.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd even if Sasori survived that punch, since Sakura had both an antidote to his poison and was learning how he fought fast enough that after a very very short window of time was able to handle him on her own, having War Arc level speed would allow her to just overpower him.",

Even if it was the heart that came out he effortlessly transfered it to another puppet so I don't think it was a problem for him. And this was only possible with Chiyo's help anyway. Sakura on her own lacks speed and any diversionary tactics or jutsu to gain an advantage and get in for the kill. She's just raw power. \n\nHer only combat achievements are beating up mindless 10 tails fission beings and getting carried by Chiyo against Sasori.

The reason this is an insane feat and why I think she was hidden Kage level is because this is beyond even Tsunade. Tsunade has never shown this ability. On top of that, the abilities Sakura has (Chakra Enhanced Strength and 100 Healings) are both Kage level abilities stressing the need for \\*PRODIGAL\\* chakra control. Like, Shizune the apprentice of Tsunade for years and arguably another of the best medical ninja in the world was incapable of using them. Sakura's chakra control is on such a level that these abilities are even enhanced beyond what Tsunade herself could usually do.",

However, both by scaring the everliving shit out if Naruto, keeping up with him and Sasuke numerous times, and the Databooks, we have conclusive evidence she was KCM level. And the only difference between her Sasori fight self and 4th war self was her putting most of her chakra in the Byakugo, so I am saying if she stopped charging it she would become KCM level even at the start if Shippudden.\n\nImagine it like this: Since ninja use chakra for nearly everything, not having access to it weakens the person significantly. Sakura had to deal with that and train her body to manage under those conditions, so when she regained full access to her chakra her unmatched levels of chakra control essentially made her a monster in the basics. Ninja can put chakra into their legs to move faster, Sakura can move faster with less chakra than normal people. Her strength is especially amped because CES (her and Tsunade\u2019s ability to hit really hard) specifically explains to be stronger with better chakra control. So imagine Sakura is like Rock Lee with chakra that amps his stats more than usual. If Rock Lee had massive stores of chakra that he could use for Gates like effects without gates, how strong do you think he would be?",

But she did work hard too. Just not in the way that I see so many Sakura fans say.), you guys get angry. \n\nSmh. At the very least, stop comparing Sakura to quarter otsutsuki reincarnates because probably only past quarter otsutsuki reincarnates are the only humans comparable to them.",

This is blatantly obvious by him being able to keep up with Kakashi, who is high jonin low kage level. He was losing so he's not equal, but he was keeping up with him. If both of them were hardly chunin level, then them having the ability to beat Kakashi would once again downplay the power of every character by making people that are low kage level susceptible to chunins, it just makes all the power levels in the verse weird as hell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou need to remember that on Naruto's first missions he was fighting the Sanin and the Akatsuki. Orochimaru is the strongest of the Sanin and easily Kage level while all members of the Akatsuki are stated in the Databooks to be Bijuu level, including Hidan. Bijuu level, by the way, is nearly the same as Kage level. In fact, there are some bijuu who are outright stronger than some of the Kage. So once again, for Naruto and Sakura to only be chunin level and able to even exist on the same level of fight as these people is simply ludicrous and almost contradictory to how power levels have worked in Naruto. While sometimes a weaker character can win, the power difference between a chunin and Orochimaru or a chunin and Deidara or a chunin and Sasori is just too much to overcome.",

Physically he could be at the level of a low jounin but he's clearly lacking in every other area. \n\nIt's not like Sakura solo'd Sasori. She worked in conjunction with a much stronger ninja and played her part in the fight. \n\nNaruto accomplished nothing vs deidara or orochimaru without the Ninetails chakra taking over. You can't really call that his power at that point since he loses control. When he encounters Sasuke (someone who's actually at jounin level) he is powerless. It's embarrassing how much stronger Sasuke is than him.\n\nNaruto is much stronger by the time he fights Kakuzu. To get to that level took intense training only he could do because of his stamina. By the end of it Yamato calls him a completely new ninja or something to emphasize how much he's changed. It's not until this point that Naruto becomes an actual strong ninja capable of fighting on his own.",

Between the start of Shippudden and the Kakuzu fight Kakashi went under no significant training, so he himself was easily on the level of a mid-high tier Akatsuki member. Considering Naruto and Sakura wound up needing help and one of them couldn't even beat the Akatsuki member (read: Bijuu/Kage level ninja) they were fighting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSasuke himself is also very arguably high-end Jonin level. Think about it, he's able to handle Orochimaru even when he uses his forms where he is less inhibited by sickness like the giant snake, and he shows changes in chakra shape that even Orochimaru wasn't prepared for (that lightning sword). So honestly you could make a solid case for him being low-Kage level, which is further supported by him being able to take on Deidara who beat Gaara, an actual kage. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTyping that, I realize that Sasuke is just actually Kage level. He literally beat a guy that beat a kage after all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're right, Rasenshuriken Training Naruto is MUCH stronger than he was at the start and actually on the level of Akatsuki members, whom I remind you are Bijuu - Kage level. In particular, anyone stronger than Deidara (this includes Sasori and Kakuzu) are objectively Kage level, since they're stronger than a Kage buster.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo summarize since I've connected some more dots while typing this: Sasuke, Kakashi, Sasori, Deidara, and Kakuzu are all Kage level to some extent. They may not be the strongest Kage level, but they're definitely on that level. I don't think you need me to explain that most of them would probably beat Mei, though she's a particularly weak Kage so that means little. And that would also support low-mid jonin Naruto and Sakura.",

And I don't have a hard list of every jonin ever to give you names, but what it comes down to at least for Sakura is that she literally became a Jonin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd even the weakened Orochimaru was still a terror. Kabuto, who knew how weakened Orochimaru was even after getting sick, was still shitting himself when he saw what Sasuke did. If Orochimaru had weakened past Kabuto's level (and thus Kakashi's level at least going by Part 1) then Kabuto would have been MUCH less surprised and scared. But that's irrelevant to Naruto and Sakura, who were in fact able to either keep up with, press, or scare the shit out of Kakashi.",

I think you're wildly overestimating both her speed and how much chakra is being funneled. \n\nI'm confident it was Sasori the human puppet that came out of hiruko not his flesh heart. Even if it was the heart that came out he effortlessly transfered it to another puppet so I don't think it was a problem for him. And this was only possible with Chiyo's help anyway. Sakura on her own lacks speed and any diversionary tactics or jutsu to gain an advantage and get in for the kill. She's just raw power. \n\nHer only combat achievements are beating up mindless 10 tails fission beings and getting carried by Chiyo against Sasori.

The reason this is an insane feat and why I think she was hidden Kage level is because this is beyond even Tsunade. Tsunade has never shown this ability. On top of that, the abilities Sakura has (Chakra Enhanced Strength and 100 Healings) are both Kage level abilities stressing the need for \\*PRODIGAL\\* chakra control. Like, Shizune the apprentice of Tsunade for years and arguably another of the best medical ninja in the world was incapable of using them. Sakura's chakra control is on such a level that these abilities are even enhanced beyond what Tsunade herself could usually do.",

However, both by scaring the everliving shit out if Naruto, keeping up with him and Sasuke numerous times, and the Databooks, we have conclusive evidence she was KCM level. And the only difference between her Sasori fight self and 4th war self was her putting most of her chakra in the Byakugo, so I am saying if she stopped charging it she would become KCM level even at the start if Shippudden.\n\nImagine it like this: Since ninja use chakra for nearly everything, not having access to it weakens the person significantly. Sakura had to deal with that and train her body to manage under those conditions, so when she regained full access to her chakra her unmatched levels of chakra control essentially made her a monster in the basics. Ninja can put chakra into their legs to move faster, Sakura can move faster with less chakra than normal people. Her strength is especially amped because CES (her and Tsunade\u2019s ability to hit really hard) specifically explains to be stronger with better chakra control. So imagine Sakura is like Rock Lee with chakra that amps his stats more than usual. If Rock Lee had massive stores of chakra that he could use for Gates like effects without gates, how strong do you think he would be?",

I was actively trying to downplay Sakura cause her excellent chakra control doesn\u2019t mean shit to other broken abilities but apparently that means I\u2019m trying to follow some agenda made by the Sakura fans lmao. \n\nAnyways, from the start it just looked like you were nitpicking a specific part instead of looking at the big picture. Naruto and Sasuke\u2019s abilities are fucking broken. You even say that they shouldn\u2019t be compared to Sakura because only past quarter otsutsuki reincarnates are comparable to them. THATS THE FUCKING POINT! THOSE TWO HAVE BUSTED ASS ABILITIES AND EXCELLENT CHAKRA CONTROL AINT GOT SHIT! Sure, she had that at the start of the show but it doesn\u2019t hold a fucking candle to the other shit. \n\nAlso you never really answered it, how many times does it reference the excellent chakra control? Just as much as kuruma? Or the sharingan? Is it as important as those two? The answer is probably no. So it just isn\u2019t that important. She had that ability, I\u2019ll give you that. But if that ability was never written in the story, I wouldn\u2019t think it would change Sakura at all. Lol.",

If both of them were hardly chunin level, then them having the ability to beat Kakashi would once again downplay the power of every character by making people that are low kage level susceptible to chunins, it just makes all the power levels in the verse weird as hell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou need to remember that on Naruto's first missions he was fighting the Sanin and the Akatsuki. Orochimaru is the strongest of the Sanin and easily Kage level while all members of the Akatsuki are stated in the Databooks to be Bijuu level, including Hidan. Bijuu level, by the way, is nearly the same as Kage level. In fact, there are some bijuu who are outright stronger than some of the Kage. So once again, for Naruto and Sakura to only be chunin level and able to even exist on the same level of fight as these people is simply ludicrous and almost contradictory to how power levels have worked in Naruto. While sometimes a weaker character can win, the power difference between a chunin and Orochimaru or a chunin and Deidara or a chunin and Sasori is just too much to overcome.",

Physically he could be at the level of a low jounin but he's clearly lacking in every other area. \n\nIt's not like Sakura solo'd Sasori. She worked in conjunction with a much stronger ninja and played her part in the fight. \n\nNaruto accomplished nothing vs deidara or orochimaru without the Ninetails chakra taking over. You can't really call that his power at that point since he loses control. When he encounters Sasuke (someone who's actually at jounin level) he is powerless. It's embarrassing how much stronger Sasuke is than him.\n\nNaruto is much stronger by the time he fights Kakuzu. To get to that level took intense training only he could do because of his stamina. By the end of it Yamato calls him a completely new ninja or something to emphasize how much he's changed.

Between the start of Shippudden and the Kakuzu fight Kakashi went under no significant training, so he himself was easily on the level of a mid-high tier Akatsuki member. Considering Naruto and Sakura wound up needing help and one of them couldn't even beat the Akatsuki member (read: Bijuu/Kage level ninja) they were fighting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSasuke himself is also very arguably high-end Jonin level. Think about it, he's able to handle Orochimaru even when he uses his forms where he is less inhibited by sickness like the giant snake, and he shows changes in chakra shape that even Orochimaru wasn't prepared for (that lightning sword). So honestly you could make a solid case for him being low-Kage level, which is further supported by him being able to take on Deidara who beat Gaara, an actual kage. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTyping that, I realize that Sasuke is just actually Kage level. He literally beat a guy that beat a kage after all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're right, Rasenshuriken Training Naruto is MUCH stronger than he was at the start and actually on the level of Akatsuki members, whom I remind you are Bijuu - Kage level. In particular, anyone stronger than Deidara (this includes Sasori and Kakuzu) are objectively Kage level, since they're stronger than a Kage buster.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo summarize since I've connected some more dots while typing this: Sasuke, Kakashi, Sasori, Deidara, and Kakuzu are all Kage level to some extent. They may not be the strongest Kage level, but they're definitely on that level. I don't think you need me to explain that most of them would probably beat Mei, though she's a particularly weak Kage so that means little. And that would also support low-mid jonin Naruto and Sakura.",

And I don't have a hard list of every jonin ever to give you names, but what it comes down to at least for Sakura is that she literally became a Jonin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd even the weakened Orochimaru was still a terror. Kabuto, who knew how weakened Orochimaru was even after getting sick, was still shitting himself when he saw what Sasuke did. If Orochimaru had weakened past Kabuto's level (and thus Kakashi's level at least going by Part 1) then Kabuto would have been MUCH less surprised and scared. But that's irrelevant to Naruto and Sakura, who were in fact able to either keep up with, press, or scare the shit out of Kakashi.",

Like how if you punch a hard wall you feel it more than if you punch a pillow, the limbo clone wouldn't budge an inch so Guy would probably just collapse into the clone and become a pile of mushy Guy Goo on the ground due to all that force suddenly stopping at once.",

On top of that, the abilities Sakura has (Chakra Enhanced Strength and 100 Healings) are both Kage level abilities stressing the need for \\*PRODIGAL\\* chakra control. Like, Shizune the apprentice of Tsunade for years and arguably another of the best medical ninja in the world was incapable of using them. Sakura's chakra control is on such a level that these abilities are even enhanced beyond what Tsunade herself could usually do.",

However, both by scaring the everliving shit out if Naruto, keeping up with him and Sasuke numerous times, and the Databooks, we have conclusive evidence she was KCM level. And the only difference between her Sasori fight self and 4th war self was her putting most of her chakra in the Byakugo, so I am saying if she stopped charging it she would become KCM level even at the start if Shippudden.\n\nImagine it like this: Since ninja use chakra for nearly everything, not having access to it weakens the person significantly. Sakura had to deal with that and train her body to manage under those conditions, so when she regained full access to her chakra her unmatched levels of chakra control essentially made her a monster in the basics. Ninja can put chakra into their legs to move faster, Sakura can move faster with less chakra than normal people. Her strength is especially amped because CES (her and Tsunade\u2019s ability to hit really hard) specifically explains to be stronger with better chakra control. So imagine Sakura is like Rock Lee with chakra that amps his stats more than usual. If Rock Lee had massive stores of chakra that he could use for Gates like effects without gates, how strong do you think he would be?",

This is blatantly obvious by him being able to keep up with Kakashi, who is high jonin low kage level. He was losing so he's not equal, but he was keeping up with him. If both of them were hardly chunin level, then them having the ability to beat Kakashi would once again downplay the power of every character by making people that are low kage level susceptible to chunins, it just makes all the power levels in the verse weird as hell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou need to remember that on Naruto's first missions he was fighting the Sanin and the Akatsuki. Orochimaru is the strongest of the Sanin and easily Kage level while all members of the Akatsuki are stated in the Databooks to be Bijuu level, including Hidan. Bijuu level, by the way, is nearly the same as Kage level. In fact, there are some bijuu who are outright stronger than some of the Kage. So once again, for Naruto and Sakura to only be chunin level and able to even exist on the same level of fight as these people is simply ludicrous and almost contradictory to how power levels have worked in Naruto. While sometimes a weaker character can win, the power difference between a chunin and Orochimaru or a chunin and Deidara or a chunin and Sasori is just too much to overcome.",

Physically he could be at the level of a low jounin but he's clearly lacking in every other area. \n\nIt's not like Sakura solo'd Sasori. She worked in conjunction with a much stronger ninja and played her part in the fight. \n\nNaruto accomplished nothing vs deidara or orochimaru without the Ninetails chakra taking over. You can't really call that his power at that point since he loses control. When he encounters Sasuke (someone who's actually at jounin level) he is powerless. It's embarrassing how much stronger Sasuke is than him.\n\nNaruto is much stronger by the time he fights Kakuzu. To get to that level took intense training only he could do because of his stamina. By the end of it Yamato calls him a completely new ninja or something to emphasize how much he's changed.

Between the start of Shippudden and the Kakuzu fight Kakashi went under no significant training, so he himself was easily on the level of a mid-high tier Akatsuki member. Considering Naruto and Sakura wound up needing help and one of them couldn't even beat the Akatsuki member (read: Bijuu/Kage level ninja) they were fighting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSasuke himself is also very arguably high-end Jonin level. Think about it, he's able to handle Orochimaru even when he uses his forms where he is less inhibited by sickness like the giant snake, and he shows changes in chakra shape that even Orochimaru wasn't prepared for (that lightning sword). So honestly you could make a solid case for him being low-Kage level, which is further supported by him being able to take on Deidara who beat Gaara, an actual kage. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTyping that, I realize that Sasuke is just actually Kage level. He literally beat a guy that beat a kage after all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're right, Rasenshuriken Training Naruto is MUCH stronger than he was at the start and actually on the level of Akatsuki members, whom I remind you are Bijuu - Kage level. In particular, anyone stronger than Deidara (this includes Sasori and Kakuzu) are objectively Kage level, since they're stronger than a Kage buster.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo summarize since I've connected some more dots while typing this: Sasuke, Kakashi, Sasori, Deidara, and Kakuzu are all Kage level to some extent. They may not be the strongest Kage level, but they're definitely on that level. I don't think you need me to explain that most of them would probably beat Mei, though she's a particularly weak Kage so that means little. And that would also support low-mid jonin Naruto and Sakura.",

On top of that, the abilities Sakura has (Chakra Enhanced Strength and 100 Healings) are both Kage level abilities stressing the need for \\*PRODIGAL\\* chakra control. Like, Shizune the apprentice of Tsunade for years and arguably another of the best medical ninja in the world was incapable of using them.

If both of them were hardly chunin level, then them having the ability to beat Kakashi would once again downplay the power of every character by making people that are low kage level susceptible to chunins, it just makes all the power levels in the verse weird as hell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou need to remember that on Naruto's first missions he was fighting the Sanin and the Akatsuki. Orochimaru is the strongest of the Sanin and easily Kage level while all members of the Akatsuki are stated in the Databooks to be Bijuu level, including Hidan. Bijuu level, by the way, is nearly the same as Kage level. In fact, there are some bijuu who are outright stronger than some of the Kage. So once again, for Naruto and Sakura to only be chunin level and able to even exist on the same level of fight as these people is simply ludicrous and almost contradictory to how power levels have worked in Naruto. While sometimes a weaker character can win, the power difference between a chunin and Orochimaru or a chunin and Deidara or a chunin and Sasori is just too much to overcome.",

Physically he could be at the level of a low jounin but he's clearly lacking in every other area. \n\nIt's not like Sakura solo'd Sasori. She worked in conjunction with a much stronger ninja and played her part in the fight. \n\nNaruto accomplished nothing vs deidara or orochimaru without the Ninetails chakra taking over. You can't really call that his power at that point since he loses control. When he encounters Sasuke (someone who's actually at jounin level) he is powerless. It's embarrassing how much stronger Sasuke is than him.\n\nNaruto is much stronger by the time he fights Kakuzu. To get to that level took intense training only he could do because of his stamina.

Considering Naruto and Sakura wound up needing help and one of them couldn't even beat the Akatsuki member (read: Bijuu/Kage level ninja) they were fighting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSasuke himself is also very arguably high-end Jonin level. Think about it, he's able to handle Orochimaru even when he uses his forms where he is less inhibited by sickness like the giant snake, and he shows changes in chakra shape that even Orochimaru wasn't prepared for (that lightning sword). So honestly you could make a solid case for him being low-Kage level, which is further supported by him being able to take on Deidara who beat Gaara, an actual kage. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTyping that, I realize that Sasuke is just actually Kage level. He literally beat a guy that beat a kage after all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're right, Rasenshuriken Training Naruto is MUCH stronger than he was at the start and actually on the level of Akatsuki members, whom I remind you are Bijuu - Kage level. In particular, anyone stronger than Deidara (this includes Sasori and Kakuzu) are objectively Kage level, since they're stronger than a Kage buster.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo summarize since I've connected some more dots while typing this: Sasuke, Kakashi, Sasori, Deidara, and Kakuzu are all Kage level to some extent. They may not be the strongest Kage level, but they're definitely on that level. I don't think you need me to explain that most of them would probably beat Mei, though she's a particularly weak Kage so that means little. And that would also support low-mid jonin Naruto and Sakura.",

Kabuto, who knew how weakened Orochimaru was even after getting sick, was still shitting himself when he saw what Sasuke did. If Orochimaru had weakened past Kabuto's level (and thus Kakashi's level at least going by Part 1) then Kabuto would have been MUCH less surprised and scared.

On top of that, the abilities Sakura has (Chakra Enhanced Strength and 100 Healings) are both Kage level abilities stressing the need for \\*PRODIGAL\\* chakra control. Like, Shizune the apprentice of Tsunade for years and arguably another of the best medical ninja in the world was incapable of using them.

This is blatantly obvious by him being able to keep up with Kakashi, who is high jonin low kage level. He was losing so he's not equal, but he was keeping up with him. If both of them were hardly chunin level, then them having the ability to beat Kakashi would once again downplay the power of every character by making people that are low kage level susceptible to chunins, it just makes all the power levels in the verse weird as hell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou need to remember that on Naruto's first missions he was fighting the Sanin and the Akatsuki. Orochimaru is the strongest of the Sanin and easily Kage level while all members of the Akatsuki are stated in the Databooks to be Bijuu level, including Hidan. Bijuu level, by the way, is nearly the same as Kage level. In fact, there are some bijuu who are outright stronger than some of the Kage. So once again, for Naruto and Sakura to only be chunin level and able to even exist on the same level of fight as these people is simply ludicrous and almost contradictory to how power levels have worked in Naruto. While sometimes a weaker character can win, the power difference between a chunin and Orochimaru or a chunin and Deidara or a chunin and Sasori is just too much to overcome.",

Physically he could be at the level of a low jounin but he's clearly lacking in every other area. \n\nIt's not like Sakura solo'd Sasori. She worked in conjunction with a much stronger ninja and played her part in the fight. \n\nNaruto accomplished nothing vs deidara or orochimaru without the Ninetails chakra taking over. You can't really call that his power at that point since he loses control. When he encounters Sasuke (someone who's actually at jounin level) he is powerless. It's embarrassing how much stronger Sasuke is than him.\n\nNaruto is much stronger by the time he fights Kakuzu. To get to that level took intense training only he could do because of his stamina. By the end of it Yamato calls him a completely new ninja or something to emphasize how much he's changed. It's not until this point that Naruto becomes an actual strong ninja capable of fighting on his own.",

Between the start of Shippudden and the Kakuzu fight Kakashi went under no significant training, so he himself was easily on the level of a mid-high tier Akatsuki member. Considering Naruto and Sakura wound up needing help and one of them couldn't even beat the Akatsuki member (read: Bijuu/Kage level ninja) they were fighting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSasuke himself is also very arguably high-end Jonin level. Think about it, he's able to handle Orochimaru even when he uses his forms where he is less inhibited by sickness like the giant snake, and he shows changes in chakra shape that even Orochimaru wasn't prepared for (that lightning sword). So honestly you could make a solid case for him being low-Kage level, which is further supported by him being able to take on Deidara who beat Gaara, an actual kage. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTyping that, I realize that Sasuke is just actually Kage level. He literally beat a guy that beat a kage after all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're right, Rasenshuriken Training Naruto is MUCH stronger than he was at the start and actually on the level of Akatsuki members, whom I remind you are Bijuu - Kage level. In particular, anyone stronger than Deidara (this includes Sasori and Kakuzu) are objectively Kage level, since they're stronger than a Kage buster.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo summarize since I've connected some more dots while typing this: Sasuke, Kakashi, Sasori, Deidara, and Kakuzu are all Kage level to some extent. They may not be the strongest Kage level, but they're definitely on that level. I don't think you need me to explain that most of them would probably beat Mei, though she's a particularly weak Kage so that means little. And that would also support low-mid jonin Naruto and Sakura.",

This is blatantly obvious by him being able to keep up with Kakashi, who is high jonin low kage level. He was losing so he's not equal, but he was keeping up with him. If both of them were hardly chunin level, then them having the ability to beat Kakashi would once again downplay the power of every character by making people that are low kage level susceptible to chunins, it just makes all the power levels in the verse weird as hell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou need to remember that on Naruto's first missions he was fighting the Sanin and the Akatsuki. Orochimaru is the strongest of the Sanin and easily Kage level while all members of the Akatsuki are stated in the Databooks to be Bijuu level, including Hidan. Bijuu level, by the way, is nearly the same as Kage level. In fact, there are some bijuu who are outright stronger than some of the Kage. So once again, for Naruto and Sakura to only be chunin level and able to even exist on the same level of fight as these people is simply ludicrous and almost contradictory to how power levels have worked in Naruto. While sometimes a weaker character can win, the power difference between a chunin and Orochimaru or a chunin and Deidara or a chunin and Sasori is just too much to overcome.",

Physically he could be at the level of a low jounin but he's clearly lacking in every other area. \n\nIt's not like Sakura solo'd Sasori. She worked in conjunction with a much stronger ninja and played her part in the fight. \n\nNaruto accomplished nothing vs deidara or orochimaru without the Ninetails chakra taking over. You can't really call that his power at that point since he loses control. When he encounters Sasuke (someone who's actually at jounin level) he is powerless. It's embarrassing how much stronger Sasuke is than him.\n\nNaruto is much stronger by the time he fights Kakuzu. To get to that level took intense training only he could do because of his stamina.

Between the start of Shippudden and the Kakuzu fight Kakashi went under no significant training, so he himself was easily on the level of a mid-high tier Akatsuki member. Considering Naruto and Sakura wound up needing help and one of them couldn't even beat the Akatsuki member (read: Bijuu/Kage level ninja) they were fighting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSasuke himself is also very arguably high-end Jonin level. Think about it, he's able to handle Orochimaru even when he uses his forms where he is less inhibited by sickness like the giant snake, and he shows changes in chakra shape that even Orochimaru wasn't prepared for (that lightning sword). So honestly you could make a solid case for him being low-Kage level, which is further supported by him being able to take on Deidara who beat Gaara, an actual kage. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTyping that, I realize that Sasuke is just actually Kage level. He literally beat a guy that beat a kage after all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're right, Rasenshuriken Training Naruto is MUCH stronger than he was at the start and actually on the level of Akatsuki members, whom I remind you are Bijuu - Kage level. In particular, anyone stronger than Deidara (this includes Sasori and Kakuzu) are objectively Kage level, since they're stronger than a Kage buster.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo summarize since I've connected some more dots while typing this: Sasuke, Kakashi, Sasori, Deidara, and Kakuzu are all Kage level to some extent. They may not be the strongest Kage level, but they're definitely on that level. I don't think you need me to explain that most of them would probably beat Mei, though she's a particularly weak Kage so that means little. And that would also support low-mid jonin Naruto and Sakura.",

But that's irrelevant to Naruto and Sakura, who were in fact able to either keep up with, press, or scare the shit out of Kakashi.",

Orochimaru is the strongest of the Sanin and easily Kage level while all members of the Akatsuki are stated in the Databooks to be Bijuu level, including Hidan. Bijuu level, by the way, is nearly the same as Kage level. In fact, there are some bijuu who are outright stronger than some of the Kage. So once again, for Naruto and Sakura to only be chunin level and able to even exist on the same level of fight as these people is simply ludicrous and almost contradictory to how power levels have worked in Naruto. While sometimes a weaker character can win, the power difference between a chunin and Orochimaru or a chunin and Deidara or a chunin and Sasori is just too much to overcome.",

Between the start of Shippudden and the Kakuzu fight Kakashi went under no significant training, so he himself was easily on the level of a mid-high tier Akatsuki member. Considering Naruto and Sakura wound up needing help and one of them couldn't even beat the Akatsuki member (read: Bijuu/Kage level ninja) they were fighting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSasuke himself is also very arguably high-end Jonin level. Think about it, he's able to handle Orochimaru even when he uses his forms where he is less inhibited by sickness like the giant snake, and he shows changes in chakra shape that even Orochimaru wasn't prepared for (that lightning sword). So honestly you could make a solid case for him being low-Kage level, which is further supported by him being able to take on Deidara who beat Gaara, an actual kage. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTyping that, I realize that Sasuke is just actually Kage level. He literally beat a guy that beat a kage after all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're right, Rasenshuriken Training Naruto is MUCH stronger than he was at the start and actually on the level of Akatsuki members, whom I remind you are Bijuu - Kage level. In particular, anyone stronger than Deidara (this includes Sasori and Kakuzu) are objectively Kage level, since they're stronger than a Kage buster.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo summarize since I've connected some more dots while typing this: Sasuke, Kakashi, Sasori, Deidara, and Kakuzu are all Kage level to some extent. They may not be the strongest Kage level, but they're definitely on that level. I don't think you need me to explain that most of them would probably beat Mei, though she's a particularly weak Kage so that means little. And that would also support low-mid jonin Naruto and Sakura.",

This is blatantly obvious by him being able to keep up with Kakashi, who is high jonin low kage level. He was losing so he's not equal, but he was keeping up with him. If both of them were hardly chunin level, then them having the ability to beat Kakashi would once again downplay the power of every character by making people that are low kage level susceptible to chunins, it just makes all the power levels in the verse weird as hell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou need to remember that on Naruto's first missions he was fighting the Sanin and the Akatsuki. Orochimaru is the strongest of the Sanin and easily Kage level while all members of the Akatsuki are stated in the Databooks to be Bijuu level, including Hidan. Bijuu level, by the way, is nearly the same as Kage level. In fact, there are some bijuu who are outright stronger than some of the Kage. So once again, for Naruto and Sakura to only be chunin level and able to even exist on the same level of fight as these people is simply ludicrous and almost contradictory to how power levels have worked in Naruto. While sometimes a weaker character can win, the power difference between a chunin and Orochimaru or a chunin and Deidara or a chunin and Sasori is just too much to overcome.",

Physically he could be at the level of a low jounin but he's clearly lacking in every other area. \n\nIt's not like Sakura solo'd Sasori. She worked in conjunction with a much stronger ninja and played her part in the fight. \n\nNaruto accomplished nothing vs deidara or orochimaru without the Ninetails chakra taking over. You can't really call that his power at that point since he loses control. When he encounters Sasuke (someone who's actually at jounin level) he is powerless. It's embarrassing how much stronger Sasuke is than him.\n\nNaruto is much stronger by the time he fights Kakuzu. To get to that level took intense training only he could do because of his stamina.

Between the start of Shippudden and the Kakuzu fight Kakashi went under no significant training, so he himself was easily on the level of a mid-high tier Akatsuki member. Considering Naruto and Sakura wound up needing help and one of them couldn't even beat the Akatsuki member (read: Bijuu/Kage level ninja) they were fighting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSasuke himself is also very arguably high-end Jonin level. Think about it, he's able to handle Orochimaru even when he uses his forms where he is less inhibited by sickness like the giant snake, and he shows changes in chakra shape that even Orochimaru wasn't prepared for (that lightning sword). So honestly you could make a solid case for him being low-Kage level, which is further supported by him being able to take on Deidara who beat Gaara, an actual kage. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTyping that, I realize that Sasuke is just actually Kage level. He literally beat a guy that beat a kage after all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're right, Rasenshuriken Training Naruto is MUCH stronger than he was at the start and actually on the level of Akatsuki members, whom I remind you are Bijuu - Kage level. In particular, anyone stronger than Deidara (this includes Sasori and Kakuzu) are objectively Kage level, since they're stronger than a Kage buster.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo summarize since I've connected some more dots while typing this: Sasuke, Kakashi, Sasori, Deidara, and Kakuzu are all Kage level to some extent. They may not be the strongest Kage level, but they're definitely on that level. I don't think you need me to explain that most of them would probably beat Mei, though she's a particularly weak Kage so that means little.

She worked in conjunction with a much stronger ninja and played her part in the fight. \n\nNaruto accomplished nothing vs deidara or orochimaru without the Ninetails chakra taking over. You can't really call that his power at that point since he loses control. When he encounters Sasuke (someone who's actually at jounin level) he is powerless. It's embarrassing how much stronger Sasuke is than him.\n\nNaruto is much stronger by the time he fights Kakuzu. To get to that level took intense training only he could do because of his stamina.

Between the start of Shippudden and the Kakuzu fight Kakashi went under no significant training, so he himself was easily on the level of a mid-high tier Akatsuki member. Considering Naruto and Sakura wound up needing help and one of them couldn't even beat the Akatsuki member (read: Bijuu/Kage level ninja) they were fighting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSasuke himself is also very arguably high-end Jonin level. Think about it, he's able to handle Orochimaru even when he uses his forms where he is less inhibited by sickness like the giant snake, and he shows changes in chakra shape that even Orochimaru wasn't prepared for (that lightning sword). So honestly you could make a solid case for him being low-Kage level, which is further supported by him being able to take on Deidara who beat Gaara, an actual kage. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTyping that, I realize that Sasuke is just actually Kage level. He literally beat a guy that beat a kage after all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're right, Rasenshuriken Training Naruto is MUCH stronger than he was at the start and actually on the level of Akatsuki members, whom I remind you are Bijuu - Kage level. In particular, anyone stronger than Deidara (this includes Sasori and Kakuzu) are objectively Kage level, since they're stronger than a Kage buster.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo summarize since I've connected some more dots while typing this: Sasuke, Kakashi, Sasori, Deidara, and Kakuzu are all Kage level to some extent. They may not be the strongest Kage level, but they're definitely on that level. I don't think you need me to explain that most of them would probably beat Mei, though she's a particularly weak Kage so that means little. And that would also support low-mid jonin Naruto and Sakura.",

Kabuto, who knew how weakened Orochimaru was even after getting sick, was still shitting himself when he saw what Sasuke did.

Think about it, he's able to handle Orochimaru even when he uses his forms where he is less inhibited by sickness like the giant snake, and he shows changes in chakra shape that even Orochimaru wasn't prepared for (that lightning sword). So honestly you could make a solid case for him being low-Kage level, which is further supported by him being able to take on Deidara who beat Gaara, an actual kage. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTyping that, I realize that Sasuke is just actually Kage level. He literally beat a guy that beat a kage after all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're right, Rasenshuriken Training Naruto is MUCH stronger than he was at the start and actually on the level of Akatsuki members, whom I remind you are Bijuu - Kage level. In particular, anyone stronger than Deidara (this includes Sasori and Kakuzu) are objectively Kage level, since they're stronger than a Kage buster.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo summarize since I've connected some more dots while typing this: Sasuke, Kakashi, Sasori, Deidara, and Kakuzu are all Kage level to some extent. They may not be the strongest Kage level, but they're definitely on that level. I don't think you need me to explain that most of them would probably beat Mei, though she's a particularly weak Kage so that means little. And that would also support low-mid jonin Naruto and Sakura.",
