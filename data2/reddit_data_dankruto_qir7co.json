As just anime watchers, Hiruzen was an oldie roaming around with a staff and being hokage. But then he turns badass and shows the us why he became a hokage in the first place. He took on not only hashirama but also tobirama and made sure they were not able to finish the job. Hiruzen dying and his sacrifice as a hokage should be forever remembered. We can all claim other fights as being epic but for me, a novice Naruto watcher, when I watched this, gave me shivers and made me cry for konohamaru.",

No asspulls about who is pulling the strings of someone else of someone else of someone else but oh wait it\u2019s not done yet because actually this dude you never expected and know barely anything about was actually pulling the strings the entire time!!!\n\nBut then all the damn fillers in Boruto makes it extremely unpopular but the real cannon episodes are pretty damn good at least for me. I really feel like they should have waited quite a few years to start the anime. Hell even five years might have been appropriate. But people tend to forget that Naruto had it\u2019s negatives too because they are blinded by nostalgia. Most notably is all the unnecessarily looooong flashbacks of shit that literally just happened within the last few episodes. Hell sometimes it happened in the previous episode. Plus how they would use the same fucking long ass flashbacks over and over. It was honestly insulting to the viewer thinking we\u2019re all so fucking stupid the need to flashback for 20% of the episode like we don\u2019t have the capacity to remember what literally just fucking happened lol. \n\nI watched all of Naruto & Shippuden after it was all released but if I was having to catch episodes by the week I would have been pissed and probably would have just gave up and probably just waited years for it to get way far ahead or completed. Just imagining waiting all week just to see long ass flashbacks again taking up like a quarter of the episode. All that being said though I still like Naruto more it\u2019s just the asspulls in the war arc that left a sour taste in my mouth.",

But still Naruto is rated very highly because Kishimoto actually made effort in writing its story. Boruto has to be the worst written shonen I have ever seen besides Baki. Baki is even worse than Boruto in terms of writing. Also, the problem of flashbacks can atleast be avoided by reading the manga instead of watching the anime but Boruto's writing is inexcusable even if you only read the Manga.",

Kishi really made a lot of the characters very interesting which is something lacking in Boruto. Outside of team 7 you don\u2019t see much development of many characters. There is a lot of filler with the other characters but nothing ever noteworthy. Any time we see side characters they usually just seem average and nothing stands out. That being said I do find the Otsusuki lore kind of interesting especially how the karma works. Other than that I really want to get to see the jougan in action and find out about it\u2019s abilities.",

Naruto & Sasuke need to find a way to make up their lost powers before fighting Code. They decide to use more tactics in battle instead of only raw power, which led to their first defeat vs Jigen.\n\n2. Training for new sage buffs, the Hidden Leaf's two Sages - Naruto asks Tsunade about her grandfather's unique sage mode, the original sage mode, whose secrets lay hidden away beneath the village...\n\nSasuke is driven to finally learn sage mode of the dragon - and leaves the village, once again. He allows Boruto to come along as his pupil (really to protect him from Kara). Mitsuki tags along because Boruto, & Sarada because of her father.\n\n3. They may pay Orochimaru a visit along the way, surprised to discover Kabuto's perfect dragon form was not fully realized due to his inexperience, chaotic emotions, and multiple new experiments within his physical body during the 4th Shinobi war.\n\n4. At Ryuchi cave: Boruto reconnects with Garaga who is no longer anime-only, Mitsuki learns more about himself through his connection to snakes and discovers his untapped powers, while Sarada trains her sharingan against the largest snakes. This ultimately brings the three members of Team 7 together as they face off together vs the strongest snake in the depths of Ryucchi Cave with their newly developed skills.\n\n5. Meanwhile Sasuke perfects his Sage Mode. Elsewhere in Konoha, Naruto is training to learn the original sage mode & connects with Hashirama's summons, who offers some pointers & also shares Naruto's pain of losing a battle partner.\n\n6. It is at this point a cloaked child leaves for Konoha...",

No asspulls about who is pulling the strings of someone else of someone else of someone else but oh wait it\u2019s not done yet because actually this dude you never expected and know barely anything about was actually pulling the strings the entire time!!!\n\nBut then all the damn fillers in Boruto makes it extremely unpopular but the real cannon episodes are pretty damn good at least for me. I really feel like they should have waited quite a few years to start the anime. Hell even five years might have been appropriate. But people tend to forget that Naruto had it\u2019s negatives too because they are blinded by nostalgia. Most notably is all the unnecessarily looooong flashbacks of shit that literally just happened within the last few episodes. Hell sometimes it happened in the previous episode. Plus how they would use the same fucking long ass flashbacks over and over. It was honestly insulting to the viewer thinking we\u2019re all so fucking stupid the need to flashback for 20% of the episode like we don\u2019t have the capacity to remember what literally just fucking happened lol. \n\nI watched all of Naruto & Shippuden after it was all released but if I was having to catch episodes by the week I would have been pissed and probably would have just gave up and probably just waited years for it to get way far ahead or completed. Just imagining waiting all week just to see long ass flashbacks again taking up like a quarter of the episode. All that being said though I still like Naruto more it\u2019s just the asspulls in the war arc that left a sour taste in my mouth.",

But still Naruto is rated very highly because Kishimoto actually made effort in writing its story. Boruto has to be the worst written shonen I have ever seen besides Baki. Baki is even worse than Boruto in terms of writing. Also, the problem of flashbacks can atleast be avoided by reading the manga instead of watching the anime but Boruto's writing is inexcusable even if you only read the Manga.",

Kishi really made a lot of the characters very interesting which is something lacking in Boruto. Outside of team 7 you don\u2019t see much development of many characters. There is a lot of filler with the other characters but nothing ever noteworthy. Any time we see side characters they usually just seem average and nothing stands out. That being said I do find the Otsusuki lore kind of interesting especially how the karma works. Other than that I really want to get to see the jougan in action and find out about it\u2019s abilities.",

No asspulls about who is pulling the strings of someone else of someone else of someone else but oh wait it\u2019s not done yet because actually this dude you never expected and know barely anything about was actually pulling the strings the entire time!!!\n\nBut then all the damn fillers in Boruto makes it extremely unpopular but the real cannon episodes are pretty damn good at least for me. I really feel like they should have waited quite a few years to start the anime. Hell even five years might have been appropriate. But people tend to forget that Naruto had it\u2019s negatives too because they are blinded by nostalgia. Most notably is all the unnecessarily looooong flashbacks of shit that literally just happened within the last few episodes. Hell sometimes it happened in the previous episode. Plus how they would use the same fucking long ass flashbacks over and over. It was honestly insulting to the viewer thinking we\u2019re all so fucking stupid the need to flashback for 20% of the episode like we don\u2019t have the capacity to remember what literally just fucking happened lol. \n\nI watched all of Naruto & Shippuden after it was all released but if I was having to catch episodes by the week I would have been pissed and probably would have just gave up and probably just waited years for it to get way far ahead or completed. Just imagining waiting all week just to see long ass flashbacks again taking up like a quarter of the episode. All that being said though I still like Naruto more it\u2019s just the asspulls in the war arc that left a sour taste in my mouth.",

But still Naruto is rated very highly because Kishimoto actually made effort in writing its story. Boruto has to be the worst written shonen I have ever seen besides Baki. Baki is even worse than Boruto in terms of writing. Also, the problem of flashbacks can atleast be avoided by reading the manga instead of watching the anime but Boruto's writing is inexcusable even if you only read the Manga.",

Kishi really made a lot of the characters very interesting which is something lacking in Boruto. Outside of team 7 you don\u2019t see much development of many characters. There is a lot of filler with the other characters but nothing ever noteworthy. Any time we see side characters they usually just seem average and nothing stands out. That being said I do find the Otsusuki lore kind of interesting especially how the karma works. Other than that I really want to get to see the jougan in action and find out about it\u2019s abilities.",

But still Naruto is rated very highly because Kishimoto actually made effort in writing its story. Boruto has to be the worst written shonen I have ever seen besides Baki. Baki is even worse than Boruto in terms of writing. Also, the problem of flashbacks can atleast be avoided by reading the manga instead of watching the anime but Boruto's writing is inexcusable even if you only read the Manga.",

Kishi really made a lot of the characters very interesting which is something lacking in Boruto. Outside of team 7 you don\u2019t see much development of many characters. There is a lot of filler with the other characters but nothing ever noteworthy. Any time we see side characters they usually just seem average and nothing stands out. That being said I do find the Otsusuki lore kind of interesting especially how the karma works. Other than that I really want to get to see the jougan in action and find out about it\u2019s abilities.",

Kishi really made a lot of the characters very interesting which is something lacking in Boruto. Outside of team 7 you don\u2019t see much development of many characters. There is a lot of filler with the other characters but nothing ever noteworthy. Any time we see side characters they usually just seem average and nothing stands out. That being said I do find the Otsusuki lore kind of interesting especially how the karma works. Other than that I really want to get to see the jougan in action and find out about it\u2019s abilities.",
