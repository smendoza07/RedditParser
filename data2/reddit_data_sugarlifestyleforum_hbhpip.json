    "body": "He hasn\u2019t answered the phone in days \u2014 I thought he might\u2019ve ghosted me but he really loves me. We didn\u2019t have any issues. Today one of his co-workers called me saying everyone is calling him, saying he hasn\u2019t signed on for work and his family can\u2019t reach him. Messages don\u2019t deliver to him. His whole family is in India abroad. I went to his apartment and he wouldn\u2019t answer the door. I\u2019m waiting for the police right now. I\u2019m the last person to have contact with him, on Monday morning. Super  is giving me a hard time even though i said I was his girlfriend. Idk.\n\n\nUpdate: it\u2019s almost midnight in NY. The police said him & his laptop are gone but his car is still there. There have been no updates from his co-workers. My messages still won\u2019t send to him on WhatsApp, Facebook or imsg. I don\u2019t want to make it about me but I\u2019m honestly so scared and worried. He has been so kind and understanding towards me, all this time I\u2019ve been able to rely on him and now he\u2019s gone. I don\u2019t know what to do and there is nothing I can do. His family needs to arrange an official missing persons report from abroad or something of that sort....\n\nUpdate: his co-worker just messaged me \u201cSome one PA sent email that he is ok, but upset\u201d, I\u2019m glad to hear he\u2019s okay. I think just disappearing on everyone when there\u2019s so many people who are going to freak out is just so irresponsible.... idk. This whole situation has made me feel like I really don\u2019t know him as well as I thought I did. Thank you to everyone who was kind. I feel dumb now, but I honestly expected the worst. He\u2019s probably going to be upset with me for calling the police",
