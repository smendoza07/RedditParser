Itachi could have lessened the impact but instead he chose to amplify it by psychologically torturing him twice. So when Sasuke forgave Itachi when he awakened his mangekyo all his hatred shifted to them for causing Itachi to suffer as well.\n\nTell me you would do little after having your world first broken and then ground into dust years later by learning the truth.\n\ninb4 \"he should have just killed Danzo, Homura, and Koharu\".\n\nThey were put in power by preceding shinobi and politicians and so on back 4 generations but their beliefs all stemmed from Hashirama and Tobirama's teachings. Danzo would justify his actions saying that they didn't have Hashirama's power so they had to take drastic actions.\n\nThat's why Sasuke wanted to destroy the village. I'm not saying it's right but it was the logical endpoint for Sasuke and the last thing it was, was stupid.",

The only difference is Sasuke didn't choke.\n\nSasuke said his whim was to kill them all with Kirin but Sasuke tells Suigetsu not to kill anyone, frees Orochimaru's prisoners, refueses to kill the people he trained against under Orochimaru, and those that escaped except the one about to kill Karin. So no I don't think he was going to kill team 7 especially since later it was revealed he still thought of Naruto as a friend.\n\nPerhaps he thought Orochimaru wanted them dead so was going to knock them out.\n\nAlso shinobi kill each other all the time in war but they eventually decided to move past it.\n\nReally tell me Madara and Tobirama and everyone else in the series who has a grudge should have forgiven each other for it but that Sakura shouldn't have forgiven Sasuke.",

And as the head of the Senju clan, he would be in a position to encourage that.\n\nSo it's not explicitly stated, but there's plenty of evidence for it.",

So no I don't think he was going to kill team 7 especially since later it was revealed he still thought of Naruto as a friend.\n\nPerhaps he thought Orochimaru wanted them dead so was going to knock them out.\n\nAlso shinobi kill each other all the time in war but they eventually decided to move past it.\n\nReally tell me Madara and Tobirama and everyone else in the series who has a grudge should have forgiven each other for it but that Sakura shouldn't have forgiven Sasuke.",

The only difference is Sasuke didn't choke.\n\nSasuke said his whim was to kill them all with Kirin but Sasuke tells Suigetsu not to kill anyone, frees Orochimaru's prisoners, refueses to kill the people he trained against under Orochimaru, and those that escaped except the one about to kill Karin. So no I don't think he was going to kill team 7 especially since later it was revealed he still thought of Naruto as a friend.\n\nPerhaps he thought Orochimaru wanted them dead so was going to knock them out.\n\nAlso shinobi kill each other all the time in war but they eventually decided to move past it.\n\nReally tell me Madara and Tobirama and everyone else in the series who has a grudge should have forgiven each other for it but that Sakura shouldn't have forgiven Sasuke.",

Danzo would justify his actions saying that they didn't have Hashirama's power so they had to take drastic actions.\n\nThat's why Sasuke wanted to destroy the village.

So no I don't think he was going to kill team 7 especially since later it was revealed he still thought of Naruto as a friend.\n\nPerhaps he thought Orochimaru wanted them dead so was going to knock them out.\n\nAlso shinobi kill each other all the time in war but they eventually decided to move past it.\n\nReally tell me Madara and Tobirama and everyone else in the series who has a grudge should have forgiven each other for it but that Sakura shouldn't have forgiven Sasuke.",

So no I don't think he was going to kill team 7 especially since later it was revealed he still thought of Naruto as a friend.\n\nPerhaps he thought Orochimaru wanted them dead so was going to knock them out.\n\nAlso shinobi kill each other all the time in war but they eventually decided to move past it.\n\nReally tell me Madara and Tobirama and everyone else in the series who has a grudge should have forgiven each other for it but that Sakura shouldn't have forgiven Sasuke.",

So no I don't think he was going to kill team 7 especially since later it was revealed he still thought of Naruto as a friend.\n\nPerhaps he thought Orochimaru wanted them dead so was going to knock them out.\n\nAlso shinobi kill each other all the time in war but they eventually decided to move past it.\n\nReally tell me Madara and Tobirama and everyone else in the series who has a grudge should have forgiven each other for it but that Sakura shouldn't have forgiven Sasuke.",

So no I don't think he was going to kill team 7 especially since later it was revealed he still thought of Naruto as a friend.\n\nPerhaps he thought Orochimaru wanted them dead so was going to knock them out.\n\nAlso shinobi kill each other all the time in war but they eventually decided to move past it.\n\nReally tell me Madara and Tobirama and everyone else in the series who has a grudge should have forgiven each other for it but that Sakura shouldn't have forgiven Sasuke.",

So no I don't think he was going to kill team 7 especially since later it was revealed he still thought of Naruto as a friend.\n\nPerhaps he thought Orochimaru wanted them dead so was going to knock them out.\n\nAlso shinobi kill each other all the time in war but they eventually decided to move past it.\n\nReally tell me Madara and Tobirama and everyone else in the series who has a grudge should have forgiven each other for it but that Sakura shouldn't have forgiven Sasuke.",
