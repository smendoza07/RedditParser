    "body": "I got into a fairly bad car accident this morning.  Fractured sternum,  7 ribs and a fractured hand.  A dozen staples in my head.  I\u2019m in pain but ok.  \n\nMy girls came through for me in such a big way.  I have 3 long term (3+ years) SB\u2019s.  Two local (SF) and one in LA.  One dropped everything,  dropped off an iPad and charger, picked up my kids from school. Took care of my dog. She took so much stress off me.  Another came to visit and brought me a Jamba Juice as soon as I was cleared to eat.  I was starving with insane cotton mouth.   She sat with me for 3 hours.   My SB from LA jumped in her car and got here as soon as she could.  I told her not to but she did anyway.  She\u2019s in Nursing school, was a EMT and a scribe she knows how to get attention from the Nurses.  I\u2019m getting treated like a vip.   The nurses were joking and asked if I\u2019m Own a modeling agency or am I Dan Blazarian.\ud83d\ude02     I am drugged up,  sappy and grateful so I couldn\u2019t wait for rants and raves on Friday,  my girls came through for me in a huge way.  I love and appreciate them so much.  I am grateful that we have been able to build close relationships.",

If you need anything at all, you just DM me.  I will help you friend, no doubt.\n\nHOWEVER, I will also send you an unsolicited case of peach martinis, delivered by three male strippers. Those peach martinis will be banana hammock flavored.  Also, I will literally go around hitting on the nurses at your hospital, likely unsuccessfully.\n\nJoking about the male strippers but serious if you need anything.",

It angers me that the majority of stories we hear on here are horror stories about either scum bag men hurting women or trashy thieves robbing men. It's a crying shame that there has to be so many safety protocols in place on both sides nowadays. \n\nI'm in a recently new arrangement, and for the last month and a half, we have both been spoon feeding trust to each other. It can be frustrating at times, but unfortunately, it's the road we walk that has been paved by others. \n\nHope you heal up quickly with no issues. I'm sure you take care of those young women tremendously, but remember how good this feels how they are stepping up on their own when you spoil them next.",

            "body": "Kratom is less addictive than traditional opioids in the short term (such as 6 months).  The problem is that you\u2019d be self-administering and monitoring it which is a risk factor for addiction.  \n\nI would let doctors handle the pain and have someone around so that you\u2019re explicitly discussing your feelings about the meds just so your thoughts are organized (for instance it\u2019s best to say \u201cI look forward to my doses because they make me feel less ruminative and more relaxed.  Gotta watch out for that\u201d out loud than have it be part of a vague inner monologue). SB could be good for that.  Counselor if the worry gets strong.\n\nThat said, a six month dependency on something like oxycodone shouldn\u2019t be terribly hard to taper and break in terms of non-pain issues. If it is, a week of kratom can make the transition to no pain meds far easier - certainly tell your doc you\u2019re doing it.  Its also a fallback, as I said, if you\u2019re in full-blown pharm addiction to normalize life while making a plan to live without any opioids.  If its not short, though, you\u2019re trading addictions. \n\nFinally, everyone who has to take any opioids consistently should know this:  dependencies measured in months usually only result in acute withdrawal.  You\u2019ll have nasty flu, sleep, mood stuff for a week.  Kinda easy. Go longer term and a fair amount of the time you\u2019ll have months of depression, amotivation, sleeplessness, inability to feel much pleasure when you stop - it\u2019s very hard to endure that when you can resolve it with a snap of your fingers by taking some plant powder or a pill.  That\u2019s addiction that a reasonable, modest, and relatively competent person can get trapped in.  So don\u2019t go there unless you absolutely have to.\n\nHope this helps and that your recovery goes smoothly.",
