So since the byaguko seal has connection to katsuyu or shikkotsu forest as a whole maybe they can learn about the founder of byaguko seal and why it looks like karma etc. Maybe the founder of karma saw jigen and studied him etc and then produced byaguko seal as a by product of his research etc. So sarada could go there for this purpose too.\n\nSo just like how karma has karma stage 2 maybe byaguko seal has a stage 2 more advanced form where the user has a direct link to katsuyu's body and gains like katsuyu's advanced healing abillites and gets to katsuyu's acid and maybe some special acid jutsu's.",

There are male medical ninjas and Sarada has a connection with Aoda.\n\nIt would be nice to see her summon him as a secondary like how Sasuke has a hawk as well.\n\nHer connection to Katsuyu is weak though. They didn't give a lot of explanation to the slugs and Tsunade's history with them or how Sasuke met Aoda.\n\nI wonder if Sakura has even visited the woods after the war.",

If Shikamaru and Choji happened to be girls, it would have just been a 3 girl team. Or if Ino was a boy, it would have been a 3 boy team. Because the point was to do their 3-clan combo. Ino started learning after graduating but she really kinda sucks at it, and I honestly think she only tried because of her rivalry with Sakura.\n\nTenten does zero medical jutsus.\n\nHinata does zero medical jutsus.\n\nKurenai does zero medical jutsus.\n\nMedic ninjas are rare and it takes a really specialized skill set to be able to train for it. Being a female is not one of those specialized skills.\n\nEdit: By that logic Mitsuki should be a kickass medinin because his \"parent\" is arguably one of the best medinins in the entire franchise, who literally genetically engineered his body to be good at everything.",

He gets a cyan chakra aura when activating it. His eyes dont have any pupil or symbol like in snake sage mode you get a snake like irises or in toad sage mode you get toad like pupils. Mitsuki's eye turn yellow and have no pupil it looks like he has a yellow byagukan. He grows a single horn instead of 4 like kabuto. Its clearly totally different the main differnce being that its the first ever sage mode we have seen to have a chakra aura similar to a chakra mode.\n\nIn Boruto episode 72, Shikamaru told Tsunade the following: \"The data from Orochimaru's research will be critical to the Ninja World when the time comes to battle the Otsutsuki\". So we have evidence that orochimaru has researched the otsutsuki could it be he developed mitsuki's sage mode to have properties which harm otsutsuki's maybe its like a forbidden otsutsuki sage mode or suttin like that. But urashiki knew of the power anyways.",

And for boruto to go to mount myoboku to get a toad summon and for sarada to go to shikkotsu forest to get a baby slug or get katsuyu as her summon. \n\nAlso in the manga they touched on the byaguko seal and mitsuki saying his father research it and that its actually from the time of sage of sixth paths when they were tryna link it karma. So since the byaguko seal has connection to katsuyu or shikkotsu forest as a whole maybe they can learn about the founder of byaguko seal and why it looks like karma etc. Maybe the founder of karma saw jigen and studied him etc and then produced byaguko seal as a by product of his research etc. So sarada could go there for this purpose too.\n\nSo just like how karma has karma stage 2 maybe byaguko seal has a stage 2 more advanced form where the user has a direct link to katsuyu's body and gains like katsuyu's advanced healing abillites and gets to katsuyu's acid and maybe some special acid jutsu's.",

He gets a cyan chakra aura when activating it. His eyes dont have any pupil or symbol like in snake sage mode you get a snake like irises or in toad sage mode you get toad like pupils. Mitsuki's eye turn yellow and have no pupil it looks like he has a yellow byagukan. He grows a single horn instead of 4 like kabuto. Its clearly totally different the main differnce being that its the first ever sage mode we have seen to have a chakra aura similar to a chakra mode.\n\nIn Boruto episode 72, Shikamaru told Tsunade the following: \"The data from Orochimaru's research will be critical to the Ninja World when the time comes to battle the Otsutsuki\". So we have evidence that orochimaru has researched the otsutsuki could it be he developed mitsuki's sage mode to have properties which harm otsutsuki's maybe its like a forbidden otsutsuki sage mode or suttin like that. But urashiki knew of the power anyways.",

So since the byaguko seal has connection to katsuyu or shikkotsu forest as a whole maybe they can learn about the founder of byaguko seal and why it looks like karma etc. Maybe the founder of karma saw jigen and studied him etc and then produced byaguko seal as a by product of his research etc. So sarada could go there for this purpose too.\n\nSo just like how karma has karma stage 2 maybe byaguko seal has a stage 2 more advanced form where the user has a direct link to katsuyu's body and gains like katsuyu's advanced healing abillites and gets to katsuyu's acid and maybe some special acid jutsu's.",

If Shikamaru and Choji happened to be girls, it would have just been a 3 girl team. Or if Ino was a boy, it would have been a 3 boy team. Because the point was to do their 3-clan combo.

He gets a cyan chakra aura when activating it. His eyes dont have any pupil or symbol like in snake sage mode you get a snake like irises or in toad sage mode you get toad like pupils. Mitsuki's eye turn yellow and have no pupil it looks like he has a yellow byagukan. He grows a single horn instead of 4 like kabuto. Its clearly totally different the main differnce being that its the first ever sage mode we have seen to have a chakra aura similar to a chakra mode.\n\nIn Boruto episode 72, Shikamaru told Tsunade the following: \"The data from Orochimaru's research will be critical to the Ninja World when the time comes to battle the Otsutsuki\". So we have evidence that orochimaru has researched the otsutsuki could it be he developed mitsuki's sage mode to have properties which harm otsutsuki's maybe its like a forbidden otsutsuki sage mode or suttin like that. But urashiki knew of the power anyways.",

So since the byaguko seal has connection to katsuyu or shikkotsu forest as a whole maybe they can learn about the founder of byaguko seal and why it looks like karma etc. Maybe the founder of karma saw jigen and studied him etc and then produced byaguko seal as a by product of his research etc. So sarada could go there for this purpose too.\n\nSo just like how karma has karma stage 2 maybe byaguko seal has a stage 2 more advanced form where the user has a direct link to katsuyu's body and gains like katsuyu's advanced healing abillites and gets to katsuyu's acid and maybe some special acid jutsu's.",

If Shikamaru and Choji happened to be girls, it would have just been a 3 girl team. Or if Ino was a boy, it would have been a 3 boy team. Because the point was to do their 3-clan combo. Ino started learning after graduating but she really kinda sucks at it, and I honestly think she only tried because of her rivalry with Sakura.\n\nTenten does zero medical jutsus.\n\nHinata does zero medical jutsus.\n\nKurenai does zero medical jutsus.\n\nMedic ninjas are rare and it takes a really specialized skill set to be able to train for it. Being a female is not one of those specialized skills.\n\nEdit: By that logic Mitsuki should be a kickass medinin because his \"parent\" is arguably one of the best medinins in the entire franchise, who literally genetically engineered his body to be good at everything.",

Its clearly totally different the main differnce being that its the first ever sage mode we have seen to have a chakra aura similar to a chakra mode.\n\nIn Boruto episode 72, Shikamaru told Tsunade the following: \"The data from Orochimaru's research will be critical to the Ninja World when the time comes to battle the Otsutsuki\". So we have evidence that orochimaru has researched the otsutsuki could it be he developed mitsuki's sage mode to have properties which harm otsutsuki's maybe its like a forbidden otsutsuki sage mode or suttin like that. But urashiki knew of the power anyways.",

Maybe Sarada will be able to learn medical ninjutsu from them too. She tries too hard and ends up not being able to do it.",

And for boruto to go to mount myoboku to get a toad summon and for sarada to go to shikkotsu forest to get a baby slug or get katsuyu as her summon. \n\nAlso in the manga they touched on the byaguko seal and mitsuki saying his father research it and that its actually from the time of sage of sixth paths when they were tryna link it karma. So since the byaguko seal has connection to katsuyu or shikkotsu forest as a whole maybe they can learn about the founder of byaguko seal and why it looks like karma etc. Maybe the founder of karma saw jigen and studied him etc and then produced byaguko seal as a by product of his research etc. So sarada could go there for this purpose too.\n\nSo just like how karma has karma stage 2 maybe byaguko seal has a stage 2 more advanced form where the user has a direct link to katsuyu's body and gains like katsuyu's advanced healing abillites and gets to katsuyu's acid and maybe some special acid jutsu's.",

If Shikamaru and Choji happened to be girls, it would have just been a 3 girl team. Or if Ino was a boy, it would have been a 3 boy team. Because the point was to do their 3-clan combo. Ino started learning after graduating but she really kinda sucks at it, and I honestly think she only tried because of her rivalry with Sakura.\n\nTenten does zero medical jutsus.\n\nHinata does zero medical jutsus.\n\nKurenai does zero medical jutsus.\n\nMedic ninjas are rare and it takes a really specialized skill set to be able to train for it.

He gets a cyan chakra aura when activating it. His eyes dont have any pupil or symbol like in snake sage mode you get a snake like irises or in toad sage mode you get toad like pupils. Mitsuki's eye turn yellow and have no pupil it looks like he has a yellow byagukan. He grows a single horn instead of 4 like kabuto. Its clearly totally different the main differnce being that its the first ever sage mode we have seen to have a chakra aura similar to a chakra mode.\n\nIn Boruto episode 72, Shikamaru told Tsunade the following: \"The data from Orochimaru's research will be critical to the Ninja World when the time comes to battle the Otsutsuki\". So we have evidence that orochimaru has researched the otsutsuki could it be he developed mitsuki's sage mode to have properties which harm otsutsuki's maybe its like a forbidden otsutsuki sage mode or suttin like that. But urashiki knew of the power anyways.",

And for boruto to go to mount myoboku to get a toad summon and for sarada to go to shikkotsu forest to get a baby slug or get katsuyu as her summon. \n\nAlso in the manga they touched on the byaguko seal and mitsuki saying his father research it and that its actually from the time of sage of sixth paths when they were tryna link it karma. So since the byaguko seal has connection to katsuyu or shikkotsu forest as a whole maybe they can learn about the founder of byaguko seal and why it looks like karma etc. Maybe the founder of karma saw jigen and studied him etc and then produced byaguko seal as a by product of his research etc. So sarada could go there for this purpose too.\n\nSo just like how karma has karma stage 2 maybe byaguko seal has a stage 2 more advanced form where the user has a direct link to katsuyu's body and gains like katsuyu's advanced healing abillites and gets to katsuyu's acid and maybe some special acid jutsu's.",

He gets a cyan chakra aura when activating it. His eyes dont have any pupil or symbol like in snake sage mode you get a snake like irises or in toad sage mode you get toad like pupils. Mitsuki's eye turn yellow and have no pupil it looks like he has a yellow byagukan. He grows a single horn instead of 4 like kabuto. Its clearly totally different the main differnce being that its the first ever sage mode we have seen to have a chakra aura similar to a chakra mode.\n\nIn Boruto episode 72, Shikamaru told Tsunade the following: \"The data from Orochimaru's research will be critical to the Ninja World when the time comes to battle the Otsutsuki\". So we have evidence that orochimaru has researched the otsutsuki could it be he developed mitsuki's sage mode to have properties which harm otsutsuki's maybe its like a forbidden otsutsuki sage mode or suttin like that. But urashiki knew of the power anyways.",

None of the girls get medical jutsu training at the academy in their kunoichi classes, and most girls don't do medical training.\n\nIno was only on her team because she happened to be born a girl and a Yamanaka. If Shikamaru and Choji happened to be girls, it would have just been a 3 girl team. Or if Ino was a boy, it would have been a 3 boy team. Because the point was to do their 3-clan combo. Ino started learning after graduating but she really kinda sucks at it, and I honestly think she only tried because of her rivalry with Sakura.\n\nTenten does zero medical jutsus.\n\nHinata does zero medical jutsus.\n\nKurenai does zero medical jutsus.\n\nMedic ninjas are rare and it takes a really specialized skill set to be able to train for it. Being a female is not one of those specialized skills.\n\nEdit: By that logic Mitsuki should be a kickass medinin because his \"parent\" is arguably one of the best medinins in the entire franchise, who literally genetically engineered his body to be good at everything.",

He gets a cyan chakra aura when activating it. His eyes dont have any pupil or symbol like in snake sage mode you get a snake like irises or in toad sage mode you get toad like pupils. Mitsuki's eye turn yellow and have no pupil it looks like he has a yellow byagukan. He grows a single horn instead of 4 like kabuto. Its clearly totally different the main differnce being that its the first ever sage mode we have seen to have a chakra aura similar to a chakra mode.\n\nIn Boruto episode 72, Shikamaru told Tsunade the following: \"The data from Orochimaru's research will be critical to the Ninja World when the time comes to battle the Otsutsuki\". So we have evidence that orochimaru has researched the otsutsuki could it be he developed mitsuki's sage mode to have properties which harm otsutsuki's maybe its like a forbidden otsutsuki sage mode or suttin like that.

If Shikamaru and Choji happened to be girls, it would have just been a 3 girl team. Or if Ino was a boy, it would have been a 3 boy team. Because the point was to do their 3-clan combo. Ino started learning after graduating but she really kinda sucks at it, and I honestly think she only tried because of her rivalry with Sakura.\n\nTenten does zero medical jutsus.\n\nHinata does zero medical jutsus.\n\nKurenai does zero medical jutsus.\n\nMedic ninjas are rare and it takes a really specialized skill set to be able to train for it. Being a female is not one of those specialized skills.\n\nEdit: By that logic Mitsuki should be a kickass medinin because his \"parent\" is arguably one of the best medinins in the entire franchise, who literally genetically engineered his body to be good at everything.",

He gets a cyan chakra aura when activating it. His eyes dont have any pupil or symbol like in snake sage mode you get a snake like irises or in toad sage mode you get toad like pupils. Mitsuki's eye turn yellow and have no pupil it looks like he has a yellow byagukan. He grows a single horn instead of 4 like kabuto. Its clearly totally different the main differnce being that its the first ever sage mode we have seen to have a chakra aura similar to a chakra mode.\n\nIn Boruto episode 72, Shikamaru told Tsunade the following: \"The data from Orochimaru's research will be critical to the Ninja World when the time comes to battle the Otsutsuki\". So we have evidence that orochimaru has researched the otsutsuki could it be he developed mitsuki's sage mode to have properties which harm otsutsuki's maybe its like a forbidden otsutsuki sage mode or suttin like that. But urashiki knew of the power anyways.",

They didn't give a lot of explanation to the slugs and Tsunade's history with them or how Sasuke met Aoda.\n\nI wonder if Sakura has even visited the woods after the war.",

None of the girls get medical jutsu training at the academy in their kunoichi classes, and most girls don't do medical training.\n\nIno was only on her team because she happened to be born a girl and a Yamanaka. If Shikamaru and Choji happened to be girls, it would have just been a 3 girl team. Or if Ino was a boy, it would have been a 3 boy team. Because the point was to do their 3-clan combo. Ino started learning after graduating but she really kinda sucks at it, and I honestly think she only tried because of her rivalry with Sakura.\n\nTenten does zero medical jutsus.\n\nHinata does zero medical jutsus.\n\nKurenai does zero medical jutsus.\n\nMedic ninjas are rare and it takes a really specialized skill set to be able to train for it. Being a female is not one of those specialized skills.\n\nEdit: By that logic Mitsuki should be a kickass medinin because his \"parent\" is arguably one of the best medinins in the entire franchise, who literally genetically engineered his body to be good at everything.",

None of the girls get medical jutsu training at the academy in their kunoichi classes, and most girls don't do medical training.\n\nIno was only on her team because she happened to be born a girl and a Yamanaka. If Shikamaru and Choji happened to be girls, it would have just been a 3 girl team. Or if Ino was a boy, it would have been a 3 boy team. Because the point was to do their 3-clan combo. Ino started learning after graduating but she really kinda sucks at it, and I honestly think she only tried because of her rivalry with Sakura.\n\nTenten does zero medical jutsus.\n\nHinata does zero medical jutsus.\n\nKurenai does zero medical jutsus.\n\nMedic ninjas are rare and it takes a really specialized skill set to be able to train for it. Being a female is not one of those specialized skills.\n\nEdit: By that logic Mitsuki should be a kickass medinin because his \"parent\" is arguably one of the best medinins in the entire franchise, who literally genetically engineered his body to be good at everything.",

If Shikamaru and Choji happened to be girls, it would have just been a 3 girl team. Or if Ino was a boy, it would have been a 3 boy team. Because the point was to do their 3-clan combo.

Being a female is not one of those specialized skills.\n\nEdit: By that logic Mitsuki should be a kickass medinin because his \"parent\" is arguably one of the best medinins in the entire franchise, who literally genetically engineered his body to be good at everything.",

During the wars and pre village, they didn't even have enough medic ninjas to go around.\n\nIwabe and Inojin both were both shown to be able to use the palm technique while Sarada cooked her fish instead. She can dress a wound but even Naruto can do that if we're going by the anime - he stopped Guren from bleeding out inside Isobu.\n\nIwabe's team is all guys and Wasabi's team is all girls even after Sumire transferred.",
