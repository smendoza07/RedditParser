I used hanz de fuko [shampoo](https://www.hanzdefuko.com/products/natural-shampoo-1)/[conditioner](https://www.hanzdefuko.com/products/natural-conditioner). Towel dried my hair, ran [Kevin Murphy rough rider](http://kevinmurphy.com.au/product/rough-rider/) through my damp hair, once slicked back I put on a baseball cap (weird I know but i had seen people do this before) and let it sit for like 10 mins. When i took off the hat my hair was very easy to play around with and had really good texture too.",

Towel dried my hair, ran [Kevin Murphy rough rider](http://kevinmurphy.com.au/product/rough-rider/) through my damp hair, once slicked back I put on a baseball cap (weird I know but i had seen people do this before) and let it sit for like 10 mins. When i took off the hat my hair was very easy to play around with and had really good texture too.",
