Unfortunately I fall into the greasy hair category so I have to wash every 1 or 2 days max. When I'm drying I tend to use a towel but purposely only use my fingers to get that result, so I'll drop the towel as well. Tried scrunching my hair after using mousse while blow drying and it worked a treat. Thanks for the advice!",
