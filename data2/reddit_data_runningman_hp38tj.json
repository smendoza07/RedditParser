There just had to have been one difference: he needed to \"shoot\" up, instead of at the camera.\n\nThen, when everyone was starting to poke fun at him for the \"old-fashioned\" move, he could have said that it was a **starter's pistol**.  That would have fit in with the show title and the tagline \"Don't walk; Run!\"   That would have made it something clever, and he would have got praised instead of teased.\n\nAmusingly, it would likely have also given him the nickname \"Race Starter\" from day 1!",

Sure I\u2019m a SJH fan but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019M ONLY WATCHING FOR HER. \n\nIt\u2019s probably the hypocrites who generalize and find SJH fans toxic when they\u2019re the ones who take every little detail and turn it into something negative. Yeah I\u2019m an SJH fan but I am not toxic and I stay quiet. \n\nI just watched the first episode for the first time BECAUSE I WANTED TO CELEBRATE RUNNING MAN. I just didn\u2019t wanna go through an awkward first episode (which it wasn\u2019t) and added as an afterthought that SJH wasn\u2019t in it yet (after looking it up on wiki). Cool I guess, but y\u2019all need some reflection whoever downvoted my comment. Woo my first time being downvoted. Lmao. \n\nON TOPIC THOUGH, many more years for RM please!",

Even the theme songs for LKS and JSJ were established from episode 1. The only reason why I haven\u2019t watched it yet is because I thought it would be awkward plus more intro to RM than actual RM, but it wasn\u2019t. Still prefer the format of the later-Ish RM tho (starting around the 50s or something)",
