    "body": "Good Morning Everyone, it\u2019s me again. This story happened Sunday and it\u2019s a very funny to me at least. So my good friend in the military, came down to visit me as he missed my birthday the week before. Since I\u2019m finally legal enough to drink, we decided to go to a really upscale bar in Atlanta. We\u2019re laughing and having a good time, before my friend has to take a call leaving me at the bar. Naturally, I start playing games on my phone, and just wait. Now here\u2019s where it gets good, at the time there were two major events going on that Sunday, the Atlanta falcons were playing the Seahawks and Wicked was in town. So there were a lot of foreign investors and advertisers in town.\n\nAs I\u2019m playing games there are these investors (in a group of 6) talking loudly in French, and three of them start to make comments about me. Fun fact about me, I can speak five languages, and I just so happen to speak fluent French. For the next 5 minutes I\u2019m listening to them comment about my appearance, and the fact that American women are very expressive (I was wearing all black and had on black lipstick so maybe that\u2019s why). Then one guy says \u201cI would like to take a dip in the chocolate.\u201d (He said chocolate in French but the L in it was really hard). So I start laughing loudly and turn to them before saying \u201c\u00cates-vous s\u00fbr de vouloir faire \u00e7a?\u201d (Are you sure you want to do that?)\n\nThe look on their faces was priceless, as one of them asked \u201cVous comprenez le fran\u00e7ais?\u201d (You understand French.)\n\n\u201cOui,\u201d  I tell him, and one of the investors starts dying as the man who made the chocolate comment was red and hiding his face. \n\nThen I say in English \u201cIf your going to talk about me the least you can do is buy me a drink.\u201d\n\nAnd they did, we started talking and they were only in town for about two more weeks for business and how this was basically and extended vacation. They were actually pretty fun, and I got free drinks the entire time. Then potential SD asked if my friend was a date, and I laugh at him and told him that was basically my older brother, before getting flirty and suggesting he could be my SD in a joking manner when my friend came back and we were going to head out. As I was saying goodbye the guy I was joking with hands me a card that\u2019s wrapped in a 100 dollar bill and tell me to text him so we could meet up again.\n\nI think this count as unintended freestyling.\n\nEdit: Holy Shit! Thanks for the gold!!!",
