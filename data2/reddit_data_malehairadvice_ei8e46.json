A skilled stylist can cut it to encourage it to part how you would like it to. Part of why this middle part isn't working right now is likely to do with the original cut or growth intended for a side part.\n\nAs others have said, growing it out may help. Then you can play with it a bit and try different parts before going in for a trim that helps it to want to fall into your desired part naturally. \n\nSource: I just watched a buncha hair 101 vids for cutting men's hair cos I'm desperate for my hubs to trust me to cut his hair\ud83d\ude06. If you don't bore to easily you might have a go at it, I find the videos oddly satisfying.",
