I am a ninja, but return home everyday by 8PM the latest. I don't spoke but I love ramen. After having a cup of miso ramen and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to become the hokage. I take care not to trouble my friends and allies that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.",

Zabuza killed all of Gato's men after Naruto TnJ'd him.  Gaara went from horror-movie monster to good-guy after TnJ.  TnJ saved all of Konoha when Pain revived everyone.  That's why TnJ is so strong, it turns bad guys into good guys.",
