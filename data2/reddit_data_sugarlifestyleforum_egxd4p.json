    "body": "So i'm relaxing in a nice hot bath right now while my new SD takes a nap after our little fun session. We went to the zoo today, had an absolute blast. He insisted I pick out whatever I wanted from the gift shop so I got a cute turtle ring and an elephant shot glass. We came to the hotel, he didn't bring a condom so no PIV. He will be better prepared next time (he did not pressure me AT ALL to have sex without one). Before we got intimate I asked for my allowance and he immediately pulled it out and handed it to me and invited me to count it. He also told me whatever I want I just need to ask for. Obviously I won't abuse this, but now I don't have to feel guilty about asking. During this date another POT I had a great M&G with a week ago texted wanting to arrange our first date (he was away for the holidays). I think he has just as much potential as my current date. I think I have had my SA account reactivated for two weeks. I just deactivated it. Two SD will be enough to keep me busy and with plenty of sugar.",
