            "body": "They've been warning about sharing banking information and have banned people for discussing Pay Per Meet for years.   There is no reason to discuss PPM on the site.  You can simply say that you understand financial support is part of the expectation and only go into more detail once you have moved communications off the site.  I don't use the SA jargon and would never use the term PPM.  I usually describe that I start an arrangement on a per date allowance and that we can discuss transitioning to a periodic allowance after we have been dating a while and built trust.   It's rarely been an issue.\n\nSA has definitetly been declining, but that is mostly due to all of the \"Bad Actors\" that are scaring legitimate SBs and SDs away from the site.",

Seeing \"no ppm\" didn't make me think \"oh this is a vanilla dating site\". So yeah it didn't have any impact, at least on me. As people have said in other threads this policy will likely attract more people looking for vanilla, but the ones looking for sugar will still be there. You'll just have to search harder",

They've been setting the bar lower and lower, and telling what they see as potential SBs whatever it takes to get them onto the site. As a result you get a lot of women who have no real intention of being a SB. Simultaneously seeking has turned into a giant pool of naive women, which makes them a better target for scammers, PUAs etc.\n\nSo, now, women want cash, soon, up front, asap, to know you're serious, and SDs get burnt giving allowances a few times to people with no desire to be SBs. The only sane solution ends up being a weekly allowance or PPM, unless you have some overwhelming reason/need to avoid PPM at all costs.\n\nThat means the early stages of a sugar relationship can end up looking a lot like escorting even if the intent is a real relationship, which of course brings all the johns and escorts, because they can function in that kind of environment and take advantage of the situation.\n\nWhich is where we had been so far, with SA. Try to filter out the scammers, platonics, PUA. (Cash only, and when intimacy starts). Try to filter out the escorts and johns. (A few platonic dates, that no john or escort would tolerate). Then start the financial support, but not a month at a time.\n\nThe no PPM, at all, ever policy doesn't solve the problems PPM aims to fix. Those problem's are caused by SAs ad policy.",

But I don\u2019t answer men who message - I can give you this much per night, what can you do? \n\nI am looking for an older sophisticated gentleman who can take care of me and provide mentorship so PPM definitely doesn\u2019t help me find what I am looking for. I think it\u2019s good seek provides the option that you can choose what you look for. If a guy says he wants emotional connection, mentorship, long term, etc.. I will definitely consider. If a guy says he wants casual fun, no strings attached etc, I will hesitate. \n\nYou just have to trust what they say on SA and arrange a few dates to get to know him then decide if he is the right candidate to be my SD. \n\nI don\u2019t charge guys to meet for dinner or coffee as I am not providing a service. I choose you and I think I might like you so I go on a date with you. If I do like you very much, then I consider your offer. Basically this is how I process candidates on SA. \n\nEvery girl is different so I don\u2019t have problems how others do. Maybe to some girls, sexual compatibility is very important, not personality, so she\u2019d rather have sex on the first date. And that, I can\u2019t see anything wrong either.

In short, no need to make a new thread about something that hasn't changed :)\n\nHowever, even if we pretend this is something new, the real core question: will they be making mostly cosmetic changes, or substantive changes.   Cosmetic changes could be: posting warnings, and bans for the most obvious transactional type discussion.   Substantive changes: any mention of allowance or financial support, even just in profiles, results in a ban.  IOW, are they making changes for appearances' sake in order to get back on the apple store and keep from getting dropped by credit processing companies?  Or are they actually stamping out sugar?\n\nRight now, we haven't seen anything but the fluffiest of cosmetic changes, and there haven't been much of even that.  No reason t panic until those changes really make it impossible for sugar partners to find each other.",

They've been setting the bar lower and lower, and telling what they see as potential SBs whatever it takes to get them onto the site. As a result you get a lot of women who have no real intention of being a SB. Simultaneously seeking has turned into a giant pool of naive women, which makes them a better target for scammers, PUAs etc.\n\nSo, now, women want cash, soon, up front, asap, to know you're serious, and SDs get burnt giving allowances a few times to people with no desire to be SBs. The only sane solution ends up being a weekly allowance or PPM, unless you have some overwhelming reason/need to avoid PPM at all costs.\n\nThat means the early stages of a sugar relationship can end up looking a lot like escorting even if the intent is a real relationship, which of course brings all the johns and escorts, because they can function in that kind of environment and take advantage of the situation.\n\nWhich is where we had been so far, with SA. Try to filter out the scammers, platonics, PUA. (Cash only, and when intimacy starts). Try to filter out the escorts and johns. (A few platonic dates, that no john or escort would tolerate). Then start the financial support, but not a month at a time.\n\nThe no PPM, at all, ever policy doesn't solve the problems PPM aims to fix. Those problem's are caused by SAs ad policy.",

But I don\u2019t answer men who message - I can give you this much per night, what can you do? \n\nI am looking for an older sophisticated gentleman who can take care of me and provide mentorship so PPM definitely doesn\u2019t help me find what I am looking for. I think it\u2019s good seek provides the option that you can choose what you look for. If a guy says he wants emotional connection, mentorship, long term, etc.. I will definitely consider. If a guy says he wants casual fun, no strings attached etc, I will hesitate. \n\nYou just have to trust what they say on SA and arrange a few dates to get to know him then decide if he is the right candidate to be my SD. \n\nI don\u2019t charge guys to meet for dinner or coffee as I am not providing a service. I choose you and I think I might like you so I go on a date with you. If I do like you very much, then I consider your offer.

If a guy says he wants casual fun, no strings attached etc, I will hesitate. \n\nYou just have to trust what they say on SA and arrange a few dates to get to know him then decide if he is the right candidate to be my SD. \n\nI don\u2019t charge guys to meet for dinner or coffee as I am not providing a service. I choose you and I think I might like you so I go on a date with you. If I do like you very much, then I consider your offer.
