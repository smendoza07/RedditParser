It's just very risky to do so in combat, because you have to move really fast with it, which leaves you extremely vulnerable to counter-attacks if you miss, as seen when Kakashi tries it against the shadow clone ninja and would've been killed if Minato didn't pop up to save him. Like the person you're replying to has stated, all the Sharingan does is track movement better so you can react to counter-attacks and still use Chidori effeciently.",

Basically water beats fire because water extinguishes fire, fire beats wind because wind empowers it, wind beats lightning because air has very very little electrical conductivity. Logically speaking earth should beat it as well because the ground dissipates electricity but I guess it's just for the sake of opposing to wind as earth indeed conducts electricity. It's assumed the rock elements is a boulder or whatever instead of the ground itself representing the gigantic planet Earth, lightning can still break things and earth being the only solid element here make it logical to be countered by lightning. Regarding earth to water, it's again a philosophical comparison, something along the lines of \"earth is rigid and can replace water, serve as a dam, absorb it\".\n\nWhen it comes to Naruto and Sasuke, their elements display the symbolics. Fire style was Sasuke's fire element, which he learnt as a kid, Sasuke later learnt lightning style as he was more and more corrupted by darkness. Naruto wants to find the og Sasuke, his true friend, that is represented by fire and wind synergy. But in order to bring back Sasuke to the right path, Naruto had to fight with him and win, hence the clash between wind and lightning.",

Sort of like how Naruto used Sage Modes perception and reaction enhancing abilities to dodge the 3rd Raikage at the very last second.\n\nThe Sharingan let's you push yourself as fast as you can, while negating what would be your primary weakness of not being able to react in time to changes or counters.",

Basically water beats fire because water extinguishes fire, fire beats wind because wind empowers it, wind beats lightning because air has very very little electrical conductivity. Logically speaking earth should beat it as well because the ground dissipates electricity but I guess it's just for the sake of opposing to wind as earth indeed conducts electricity. It's assumed the rock elements is a boulder or whatever instead of the ground itself representing the gigantic planet Earth, lightning can still break things and earth being the only solid element here make it logical to be countered by lightning. Regarding earth to water, it's again a philosophical comparison, something along the lines of \"earth is rigid and can replace water, serve as a dam, absorb it\".\n\nWhen it comes to Naruto and Sasuke, their elements display the symbolics. Fire style was Sasuke's fire element, which he learnt as a kid, Sasuke later learnt lightning style as he was more and more corrupted by darkness. Naruto wants to find the og Sasuke, his true friend, that is represented by fire and wind synergy. But in order to bring back Sasuke to the right path, Naruto had to fight with him and win, hence the clash between wind and lightning.",

Sort of like how Naruto used Sage Modes perception and reaction enhancing abilities to dodge the 3rd Raikage at the very last second.\n\nThe Sharingan let's you push yourself as fast as you can, while negating what would be your primary weakness of not being able to react in time to changes or counters.",

Basically water beats fire because water extinguishes fire, fire beats wind because wind empowers it, wind beats lightning because air has very very little electrical conductivity. Logically speaking earth should beat it as well because the ground dissipates electricity but I guess it's just for the sake of opposing to wind as earth indeed conducts electricity. It's assumed the rock elements is a boulder or whatever instead of the ground itself representing the gigantic planet Earth, lightning can still break things and earth being the only solid element here make it logical to be countered by lightning. Regarding earth to water, it's again a philosophical comparison, something along the lines of \"earth is rigid and can replace water, serve as a dam, absorb it\".\n\nWhen it comes to Naruto and Sasuke, their elements display the symbolics. Fire style was Sasuke's fire element, which he learnt as a kid, Sasuke later learnt lightning style as he was more and more corrupted by darkness. Naruto wants to find the og Sasuke, his true friend, that is represented by fire and wind synergy. But in order to bring back Sasuke to the right path, Naruto had to fight with him and win, hence the clash between wind and lightning.",

Sort of like how Naruto used Sage Modes perception and reaction enhancing abilities to dodge the 3rd Raikage at the very last second.\n\nThe Sharingan let's you push yourself as fast as you can, while negating what would be your primary weakness of not being able to react in time to changes or counters.",

It's just very risky to do so in combat, because you have to move really fast with it, which leaves you extremely vulnerable to counter-attacks if you miss, as seen when Kakashi tries it against the shadow clone ninja and would've been killed if Minato didn't pop up to save him. Like the person you're replying to has stated, all the Sharingan does is track movement better so you can react to counter-attacks and still use Chidori effeciently.",

Basically water beats fire because water extinguishes fire, fire beats wind because wind empowers it, wind beats lightning because air has very very little electrical conductivity. Logically speaking earth should beat it as well because the ground dissipates electricity but I guess it's just for the sake of opposing to wind as earth indeed conducts electricity. It's assumed the rock elements is a boulder or whatever instead of the ground itself representing the gigantic planet Earth, lightning can still break things and earth being the only solid element here make it logical to be countered by lightning. Regarding earth to water, it's again a philosophical comparison, something along the lines of \"earth is rigid and can replace water, serve as a dam, absorb it\".\n\nWhen it comes to Naruto and Sasuke, their elements display the symbolics. Fire style was Sasuke's fire element, which he learnt as a kid, Sasuke later learnt lightning style as he was more and more corrupted by darkness. Naruto wants to find the og Sasuke, his true friend, that is represented by fire and wind synergy. But in order to bring back Sasuke to the right path, Naruto had to fight with him and win, hence the clash between wind and lightning.",

It's just very risky to do so in combat, because you have to move really fast with it, which leaves you extremely vulnerable to counter-attacks if you miss, as seen when Kakashi tries it against the shadow clone ninja and would've been killed if Minato didn't pop up to save him.
