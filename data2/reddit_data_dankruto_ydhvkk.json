But it all looks the same, but it comes from 3 different sources and only one of them is consciously commanded by Gaara, right?",

Even Madara absorbed Naruto's rasenshuriken as an Edo, granted he then got slapped with a rasenshuriken after Naruto got six paths powers and didn't absorb that one. Madara never really bothered with traditional rinnegan abilities either. It's like they *have* these moves but just don't like using them or some shit.\n\nEdit: Tbh Momoshiki's absorption does seem to be different than the typical absorption we've always seen. He literally stores the jutsu so he can reuse it at a greater potency. Like, I doubt even Nagato could absorb shikamaru's paralysis. He couldn't even absorb Naruto's shadow clones, which are made of chakra. But apparently Momoshiki could aborb shadow clones.",

But his sand shouldn't be stopped by shadow paralysis jutsu if it wasn't back then.",

Kinda reminds me of when sasuke used genjutsu to put killer b to sleep but the 8 tails broke him out of it because only killer b was affected. The ultimate sand defense though that coats his skin and protects him from weapons passively though is his moms soul so she also shouldn\u2019t be affected by jutsu but I don\u2019t think he can use that to attack.",

The Shield of Sand, said Yashamaru, was a result of Shukaku (sealed within Gaara) using the sand to keep Gaara, and thus itself, safe. **It isn't until many years later that the Fourth Kazekage confesses to Gaara that he ordered Yashamaru to lie: **\n\nShould be obvious considering the shield still works without input after he loss the One-Tails.",

He was \\*out\\*   \n\n\nHave you ever been knocked completely unconscious for several minutes? He's not Naruto, he doesn't have Kurama regenerating him all the time.   \n\n\nThe only way it's \"dumb\" that his \"guard was down\" as he's recovering is if you think Sasuke is some kind of perfect guy who never messes up which is completely counter to like, every single fight he's ever had.   \n\n\nAs I said, if you want to say it's bad writing for him not to get it back later whatever, but I don't even know if the \\*can\\* give him his Rinnegan back, we don't know about how their whole transplant and artificial eyes program works, but it's something they should at least talk about; that's a completely different conversation though.",

But it all looks the same, but it comes from 3 different sources and only one of them is consciously commanded by Gaara, right?",

Even Madara absorbed Naruto's rasenshuriken as an Edo, granted he then got slapped with a rasenshuriken after Naruto got six paths powers and didn't absorb that one. Madara never really bothered with traditional rinnegan abilities either. It's like they *have* these moves but just don't like using them or some shit.\n\nEdit: Tbh Momoshiki's absorption does seem to be different than the typical absorption we've always seen. He literally stores the jutsu so he can reuse it at a greater potency. Like, I doubt even Nagato could absorb shikamaru's paralysis. He couldn't even absorb Naruto's shadow clones, which are made of chakra. But apparently Momoshiki could aborb shadow clones.",

They deliberately made it so Naruto was actually going to use a move and then decided not to because of an ability of the enemy, as opposed to Sasuke just not thinking fast enough on his feet which could just be plot induced stupidity. \n\nNaruto's decision was deliberate despite the fact the man's fought people who absorbed chakra previously almost all throughout Shippuden and it's never once stopped him from using shadow clones. Even against Jigen. I'm inclined to believe Momoshiki's absorption had its own special properties other than the fact he can shoot the jutsu back at increased potency.",

It doesn't logically make sense since Naruto couldn't possibly suspect he could absorb shadow clones, but they evidently wanted to get the point across anyway. All things considered, regardless what stupid shit they do we know Naruto and Sasuke didn't get dumber. Boruto telling him not to do that was the writer's way of letting the viewers know what Momoshiki is capable of.\n\nOnly *possible* way I see Boruto guessing he can't absorb shadow clones is by seeing him absorb shadow paralysis (which Naruto also didn't see, I think) and assume he can absorb clones as well.\n\nEdit: Chakra cloak isn't ninjutsu either. Never has anyone snatched an entire chakra cloak off someone's body lol. Cloaks require a constant supply of chakra to maintain. All the way up until the user runs out of chakra.",

The Shield of Sand, said Yashamaru, was a result of Shukaku (sealed within Gaara) using the sand to keep Gaara, and thus itself, safe. **It isn't until many years later that the Fourth Kazekage confesses to Gaara that he ordered Yashamaru to lie: **\n\nShould be obvious considering the shield still works without input after he loss the One-Tails.",

You're framing it like he was fighting Boruto and just lost, and what happened was that Momo got in a really good cheap shot in the 2 second window where it was possible to cheap shot Sasuke.",

In 3 kicks Sasuke was knocked completely unconscious and Boruto had to dig him out of the rocks; then as he was waking up, he had to use his Rinnegan to save Boruto. Then he gets kicked \\*again\\* and the next time we see him he's completely unconscious on the ground with most of the rods \\*broken off still inside him\\* with one of the rods still completely inside him. He was \\*out\\*   \n\n\nHave you ever been knocked completely unconscious for several minutes? He's not Naruto, he doesn't have Kurama regenerating him all the time.   \n\n\nThe only way it's \"dumb\" that his \"guard was down\" as he's recovering is if you think Sasuke is some kind of perfect guy who never messes up which is completely counter to like, every single fight he's ever had.   \n\n\nAs I said, if you want to say it's bad writing for him not to get it back later whatever, but I don't even know if the \\*can\\* give him his Rinnegan back, we don't know about how their whole transplant and artificial eyes program works, but it's something they should at least talk about; that's a completely different conversation though.",

Even Madara absorbed Naruto's rasenshuriken as an Edo, granted he then got slapped with a rasenshuriken after Naruto got six paths powers and didn't absorb that one. Madara never really bothered with traditional rinnegan abilities either. It's like they *have* these moves but just don't like using them or some shit.\n\nEdit: Tbh Momoshiki's absorption does seem to be different than the typical absorption we've always seen. He literally stores the jutsu so he can reuse it at a greater potency. Like, I doubt even Nagato could absorb shikamaru's paralysis. He couldn't even absorb Naruto's shadow clones, which are made of chakra. But apparently Momoshiki could aborb shadow clones.",

Later that same day, Yashamaru, under orders of the Fourth Kazekage, tried to assassinate Gaara. After his attack failed, Yashamaru told Gaara that he lied earlier: Karura did not love Gaara; she hated him. The Shield of Sand, said Yashamaru, was a result of Shukaku (sealed within Gaara) using the sand to keep Gaara, and thus itself, safe. **It isn't until many years later that the Fourth Kazekage confesses to Gaara that he ordered Yashamaru to lie: **\n\nShould be obvious considering the shield still works without input after he loss the One-Tails.",

Madara never really bothered with traditional rinnegan abilities either. It's like they *have* these moves but just don't like using them or some shit.\n\nEdit: Tbh Momoshiki's absorption does seem to be different than the typical absorption we've always seen. He literally stores the jutsu so he can reuse it at a greater potency. Like, I doubt even Nagato could absorb shikamaru's paralysis. He couldn't even absorb Naruto's shadow clones, which are made of chakra. But apparently Momoshiki could aborb shadow clones.",

They deliberately made it so Naruto was actually going to use a move and then decided not to because of an ability of the enemy, as opposed to Sasuke just not thinking fast enough on his feet which could just be plot induced stupidity. \n\nNaruto's decision was deliberate despite the fact the man's fought people who absorbed chakra previously almost all throughout Shippuden and it's never once stopped him from using shadow clones. Even against Jigen. I'm inclined to believe Momoshiki's absorption had its own special properties other than the fact he can shoot the jutsu back at increased potency.",

It doesn't logically make sense since Naruto couldn't possibly suspect he could absorb shadow clones, but they evidently wanted to get the point across anyway. All things considered, regardless what stupid shit they do we know Naruto and Sasuke didn't get dumber. Boruto telling him not to do that was the writer's way of letting the viewers know what Momoshiki is capable of.\n\nOnly *possible* way I see Boruto guessing he can't absorb shadow clones is by seeing him absorb shadow paralysis (which Naruto also didn't see, I think) and assume he can absorb clones as well.\n\nEdit: Chakra cloak isn't ninjutsu either. Never has anyone snatched an entire chakra cloak off someone's body lol. Cloaks require a constant supply of chakra to maintain. All the way up until the user runs out of chakra.",

Boruto telling him not to do that was the writer's way of letting the viewers know what Momoshiki is capable of.\n\nOnly *possible* way I see Boruto guessing he can't absorb shadow clones is by seeing him absorb shadow paralysis (which Naruto also didn't see, I think) and assume he can absorb clones as well.\n\nEdit: Chakra cloak isn't ninjutsu either. Never has anyone snatched an entire chakra cloak off someone's body lol. Cloaks require a constant supply of chakra to maintain. All the way up until the user runs out of chakra.",

Then he gets kicked \\*again\\* and the next time we see him he's completely unconscious on the ground with most of the rods \\*broken off still inside him\\* with one of the rods still completely inside him. He was \\*out\\*   \n\n\nHave you ever been knocked completely unconscious for several minutes? He's not Naruto, he doesn't have Kurama regenerating him all the time.   \n\n\nThe only way it's \"dumb\" that his \"guard was down\" as he's recovering is if you think Sasuke is some kind of perfect guy who never messes up which is completely counter to like, every single fight he's ever had.   \n\n\nAs I said, if you want to say it's bad writing for him not to get it back later whatever, but I don't even know if the \\*can\\* give him his Rinnegan back, we don't know about how their whole transplant and artificial eyes program works, but it's something they should at least talk about; that's a completely different conversation though.",

It doesn't logically make sense since Naruto couldn't possibly suspect he could absorb shadow clones, but they evidently wanted to get the point across anyway. All things considered, regardless what stupid shit they do we know Naruto and Sasuke didn't get dumber. Boruto telling him not to do that was the writer's way of letting the viewers know what Momoshiki is capable of.\n\nOnly *possible* way I see Boruto guessing he can't absorb shadow clones is by seeing him absorb shadow paralysis (which Naruto also didn't see, I think) and assume he can absorb clones as well.\n\nEdit: Chakra cloak isn't ninjutsu either. Never has anyone snatched an entire chakra cloak off someone's body lol. Cloaks require a constant supply of chakra to maintain. All the way up until the user runs out of chakra.",

Boruto telling him not to do that was the writer's way of letting the viewers know what Momoshiki is capable of.\n\nOnly *possible* way I see Boruto guessing he can't absorb shadow clones is by seeing him absorb shadow paralysis (which Naruto also didn't see, I think) and assume he can absorb clones as well.\n\nEdit: Chakra cloak isn't ninjutsu either. Never has anyone snatched an entire chakra cloak off someone's body lol. Cloaks require a constant supply of chakra to maintain. All the way up until the user runs out of chakra.",

In 3 kicks Sasuke was knocked completely unconscious and Boruto had to dig him out of the rocks; then as he was waking up, he had to use his Rinnegan to save Boruto. Then he gets kicked \\*again\\* and the next time we see him he's completely unconscious on the ground with most of the rods \\*broken off still inside him\\* with one of the rods still completely inside him.

He's not Naruto, he doesn't have Kurama regenerating him all the time.   \n\n\nThe only way it's \"dumb\" that his \"guard was down\" as he's recovering is if you think Sasuke is some kind of perfect guy who never messes up which is completely counter to like, every single fight he's ever had.   \n\n\nAs I said, if you want to say it's bad writing for him not to get it back later whatever, but I don't even know if the \\*can\\* give him his Rinnegan back, we don't know about how their whole transplant and artificial eyes program works, but it's something they should at least talk about; that's a completely different conversation though.",

Boruto telling him not to do that was the writer's way of letting the viewers know what Momoshiki is capable of.\n\nOnly *possible* way I see Boruto guessing he can't absorb shadow clones is by seeing him absorb shadow paralysis (which Naruto also didn't see, I think) and assume he can absorb clones as well.\n\nEdit: Chakra cloak isn't ninjutsu either. Never has anyone snatched an entire chakra cloak off someone's body lol. Cloaks require a constant supply of chakra to maintain. All the way up until the user runs out of chakra.",

This was \\*after\\* he showed up to said fight low on chakra, then went all out and still \\*lost\\* the fight.   \n\n\nYou can list feats all you want, but it doesn't make him perfect, or immune to injury, fatigue, and just plain letting his guard down. You're framing it like he was fighting Boruto and just lost, and what happened was that Momo got in a really good cheap shot in the 2 second window where it was possible to cheap shot Sasuke.",

In 3 kicks Sasuke was knocked completely unconscious and Boruto had to dig him out of the rocks; then as he was waking up, he had to use his Rinnegan to save Boruto. Then he gets kicked \\*again\\* and the next time we see him he's completely unconscious on the ground with most of the rods \\*broken off still inside him\\* with one of the rods still completely inside him.

He's not Naruto, he doesn't have Kurama regenerating him all the time.   \n\n\nThe only way it's \"dumb\" that his \"guard was down\" as he's recovering is if you think Sasuke is some kind of perfect guy who never messes up which is completely counter to like, every single fight he's ever had.   \n\n\nAs I said, if you want to say it's bad writing for him not to get it back later whatever, but I don't even know if the \\*can\\* give him his Rinnegan back, we don't know about how their whole transplant and artificial eyes program works, but it's something they should at least talk about; that's a completely different conversation though.",

It doesn't logically make sense since Naruto couldn't possibly suspect he could absorb shadow clones, but they evidently wanted to get the point across anyway. All things considered, regardless what stupid shit they do we know Naruto and Sasuke didn't get dumber. Boruto telling him not to do that was the writer's way of letting the viewers know what Momoshiki is capable of.\n\nOnly *possible* way I see Boruto guessing he can't absorb shadow clones is by seeing him absorb shadow paralysis (which Naruto also didn't see, I think) and assume he can absorb clones as well.\n\nEdit: Chakra cloak isn't ninjutsu either. Never has anyone snatched an entire chakra cloak off someone's body lol. Cloaks require a constant supply of chakra to maintain. All the way up until the user runs out of chakra.",

This was \\*after\\* he showed up to said fight low on chakra, then went all out and still \\*lost\\* the fight.   \n\n\nYou can list feats all you want, but it doesn't make him perfect, or immune to injury, fatigue, and just plain letting his guard down.

In 3 kicks Sasuke was knocked completely unconscious and Boruto had to dig him out of the rocks; then as he was waking up, he had to use his Rinnegan to save Boruto. Then he gets kicked \\*again\\* and the next time we see him he's completely unconscious on the ground with most of the rods \\*broken off still inside him\\* with one of the rods still completely inside him. He was \\*out\\*   \n\n\nHave you ever been knocked completely unconscious for several minutes? He's not Naruto, he doesn't have Kurama regenerating him all the time.   \n\n\nThe only way it's \"dumb\" that his \"guard was down\" as he's recovering is if you think Sasuke is some kind of perfect guy who never messes up which is completely counter to like, every single fight he's ever had.   \n\n\nAs I said, if you want to say it's bad writing for him not to get it back later whatever, but I don't even know if the \\*can\\* give him his Rinnegan back, we don't know about how their whole transplant and artificial eyes program works, but it's something they should at least talk about; that's a completely different conversation though.",

It doesn't logically make sense since Naruto couldn't possibly suspect he could absorb shadow clones, but they evidently wanted to get the point across anyway. All things considered, regardless what stupid shit they do we know Naruto and Sasuke didn't get dumber. Boruto telling him not to do that was the writer's way of letting the viewers know what Momoshiki is capable of.\n\nOnly *possible* way I see Boruto guessing he can't absorb shadow clones is by seeing him absorb shadow paralysis (which Naruto also didn't see, I think) and assume he can absorb clones as well.\n\nEdit: Chakra cloak isn't ninjutsu either. Never has anyone snatched an entire chakra cloak off someone's body lol. Cloaks require a constant supply of chakra to maintain. All the way up until the user runs out of chakra.",

In 3 kicks Sasuke was knocked completely unconscious and Boruto had to dig him out of the rocks; then as he was waking up, he had to use his Rinnegan to save Boruto. Then he gets kicked \\*again\\* and the next time we see him he's completely unconscious on the ground with most of the rods \\*broken off still inside him\\* with one of the rods still completely inside him. He was \\*out\\*   \n\n\nHave you ever been knocked completely unconscious for several minutes? He's not Naruto, he doesn't have Kurama regenerating him all the time.   \n\n\nThe only way it's \"dumb\" that his \"guard was down\" as he's recovering is if you think Sasuke is some kind of perfect guy who never messes up which is completely counter to like, every single fight he's ever had.   \n\n\nAs I said, if you want to say it's bad writing for him not to get it back later whatever, but I don't even know if the \\*can\\* give him his Rinnegan back, we don't know about how their whole transplant and artificial eyes program works, but it's something they should at least talk about; that's a completely different conversation though.",

It doesn't logically make sense since Naruto couldn't possibly suspect he could absorb shadow clones, but they evidently wanted to get the point across anyway. All things considered, regardless what stupid shit they do we know Naruto and Sasuke didn't get dumber. Boruto telling him not to do that was the writer's way of letting the viewers know what Momoshiki is capable of.\n\nOnly *possible* way I see Boruto guessing he can't absorb shadow clones is by seeing him absorb shadow paralysis (which Naruto also didn't see, I think) and assume he can absorb clones as well.\n\nEdit: Chakra cloak isn't ninjutsu either. Never has anyone snatched an entire chakra cloak off someone's body lol. Cloaks require a constant supply of chakra to maintain. All the way up until the user runs out of chakra.",

In 3 kicks Sasuke was knocked completely unconscious and Boruto had to dig him out of the rocks; then as he was waking up, he had to use his Rinnegan to save Boruto. Then he gets kicked \\*again\\* and the next time we see him he's completely unconscious on the ground with most of the rods \\*broken off still inside him\\* with one of the rods still completely inside him. He was \\*out\\*   \n\n\nHave you ever been knocked completely unconscious for several minutes? He's not Naruto, he doesn't have Kurama regenerating him all the time.   \n\n\nThe only way it's \"dumb\" that his \"guard was down\" as he's recovering is if you think Sasuke is some kind of perfect guy who never messes up which is completely counter to like, every single fight he's ever had.   \n\n\nAs I said, if you want to say it's bad writing for him not to get it back later whatever, but I don't even know if the \\*can\\* give him his Rinnegan back, we don't know about how their whole transplant and artificial eyes program works, but it's something they should at least talk about; that's a completely different conversation though.",

It doesn't logically make sense since Naruto couldn't possibly suspect he could absorb shadow clones, but they evidently wanted to get the point across anyway. All things considered, regardless what stupid shit they do we know Naruto and Sasuke didn't get dumber. Boruto telling him not to do that was the writer's way of letting the viewers know what Momoshiki is capable of.\n\nOnly *possible* way I see Boruto guessing he can't absorb shadow clones is by seeing him absorb shadow paralysis (which Naruto also didn't see, I think) and assume he can absorb clones as well.\n\nEdit: Chakra cloak isn't ninjutsu either. Never has anyone snatched an entire chakra cloak off someone's body lol. Cloaks require a constant supply of chakra to maintain. All the way up until the user runs out of chakra.",
