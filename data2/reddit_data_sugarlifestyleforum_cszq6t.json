    "body": "Back in March, I was playing a game of strip peep jousting on a date with a SB.  For those of you who have never done peep jousting (you really need to live a little), peeps are a marshmallow candy, usually in the form of a bright yellow duck.  You can take two peeps, name them, and then stick toothpicks in them, facing each other like a \"joust\".  Put them in the microwave for 45 seconds, and the marshmallow expands wildly, causing them to \"charge\" each other. The first one to \"stab\" the other with his toothpick wins the joust.  You can bet on your peep, so naturally, a perfect strip-game.\n#\nSo it's late in the night, and I'm down to just my tie and my boxers.  I get this peep with a face that's kinda messed up. Like one eye is kind of down by his nose, so I figure this is a guy who has seen some shit. Surely, he knows how to stab people, and I name him \"Dr. Droopy.\"  Then I go all in - the rest of my clothes and two sake bombs. The joust starts and.... whelp. My boy goes down faster than a priest at a glory hole in an elementary school. Like 3 seconds in, he is on his face, with Sir Pokes-a-lot stabbing him unnecessarily and violently in the back. I admit, in shock, I said a lot of things about Dr. Droopy's family that I didn't mean. I am not going to track down his mom and \"give her the son she always wanted instead of a marshmallow stuffed with disappointment.\"  I would never do that to Dr. Droopy on purpose. \n#\nMy girl, on the other hand, is normally a real sweatheart. She is not, however, a gracious winner. She starts screaming. Four years of sugar dating, and that's the first and only time I've seen a girl actually orgasm. She starts twirling around my kitchen like she's having a dance off with invisible friends. Tbh, I didn't see most of it. I was checking my insurance to see if I was covered for injuries related to \"excessive twerking.\"  (FYI, I'm not covered. A week later, when I called my insurance agent to get me a policy in case I am ever overwhelmed by booty, he hung up on me. So guess which licensed insurance asshole is getting a little baby brother in a few months???)\n#\nI think about Dr. Droopy sometimes. At some level, aren't we all a little bit Droopy?  Don't we all have a moment in the spotlight/microwave bulb where we fall down and need help? Hits me right in the feels folks. \n#\nLast night, my SB and I were chilling at a bar and talking about our past dates.  Mainly trying to figure out why a cool girl like her keeps seeing a nerd like me. She brings up peep jousting and says \"you got so excited about that one peep. What was his name? Mr. Poopy?\"  She knows damn well what his name was, she was just spitting on Dr. Droopy's puffy corpse. So I start sobbing for my fallen brother. I can't let her think I'm crying over a marshmallow, so don't worry, I thought fast. I told her \"whew baby, they made my champagne extra spicy tonight.\" I think she bought it.",
