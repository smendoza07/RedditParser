Everything about you makes me want to be your friend, and I wouldn't change a thing about your hair. In fact, your hair even complements your kind features. I feel almost a motherly connection here, and I just want you to tell me it's okay and tuck me in bed. I imagine waking up in the middle of the night, seeing your face peeking through the crack in my doorway, and I feel safe--and warm.
