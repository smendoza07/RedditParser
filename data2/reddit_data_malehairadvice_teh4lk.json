He trimmed it up real nice, used some nice product and even gave me tips on how to treat it to get the same results. I can't say I can replicate that look as he did, he was a master, but I've significantly improved. The big battle is learning how to manipulate the way your hair falls. Mine still likes to part at the middle regardless of how much product I use but eventually, if you beat it enough, it will fall into shape.",
