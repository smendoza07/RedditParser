And seriously, I actually like Jihyo, but this subreddit borderline needs a megathread or something for her fans to put all their creepy posts shipping her, and thirsting over her appearance, and missing the old Jihyo, and their grievances about her lack of screen time. Like, the posts here make me wonder if they're even fans of her acting because it's 90% about her looks. \n\nIt's all the same people, too. I mean, look at what a search of the word ['thug'](https://www.reddit.com/r/runningman/search?q=thug+&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=relevance&t=all) dredges up. 5/7 results are from one guy, and if you take a look at his profile, in addition to the five thug posts, in the last five months he's also posted:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/runningman/comments/i2lgcx/i_need_more_of_this_ji_hyo/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/runningman/comments/igjerm/the_swearing_angry_bird_must_be_literally_dragged/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/runningman/comments/hw3dd4/unpopular_opinion_time_im_glad_that_song_ji_hyo/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/runningman/comments/j6dahh/elegant_ji_hyo_gives_us_just_a_brief_moment_of/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/runningman/comments/iblrea/genderswapped_ji_hyo_is_hawt/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/runningman/comments/hp3kkz/jihyos_frozen_stonecold_heart_beats_for_no_guest/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/runningman/comments/hlagqm/ji_hyo_and_jong_kook_roasting_the_poor_pd_like/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/runningman/comments/hdhkoi/ji_hyo_is_a_magical_scaredy_cat/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/runningman/comments/h92crz/what_do_you_think_ji_hyo_started_spelling_that/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/runningman/comments/h8zckp/of_course_she_did_who_else_would_have/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/runningman/comments/h0mwh3/when_ji_hyo_wants_food_neither_the_game_rules_nor/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/runningman/comments/gzsg6w/noticed_that_the_staff_differentiated_rm_ji_hyos/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/runningman/comments/go7or5/food_brings_out_classic_kwangsoo_and_somin_but/\n\nThirteen posts plus the five 'thug' posts = eighteen in the last five months! No wonder it feels like we're being inundated, that's almost a post a week from just one person. Like, I get that she's a cast member, but no other member gets such a crazy amount of creepy obsession. Not even YJS, or LKS, or JSM.",

However, I realize that unlike some other actresses, I've fallen in love moreso but with her the beauty of her personality and won't be watching her dramas, but variety shows. \n\nThe same with Kim Hee Sun. I've always known about her since her debut, and always found her attractive, but always thought she was a snow queen. That changed when I saw her on *Knowing Bros* and I my eyes, her beauty bloomed. Like Na Ra, I'm looking for her variety appearances and don't have an interest in her drama/movie work.",

It\u2019s fine for you to feel that there are other beautiful people but I think it\u2019s also appropriate for this person posting this to say that it\u2019s unbelievable that Jihyo is going to be 40 soon. I personally feel that Jihyo does look like she is in her early 30s (Some fans insist that she looks like she\u2019s in her 20s but I do not agree with that as she has changed since the early days of RM and she has become more mature yet remaining her youthful looks).
