I don\u2019t know what he did with Suigetsu but mostly it is still explainable.\nIn Anime the cool brooding edgy good looking guy gets all chicks, meaning that he already had a Nat20 rolled on every interaction with a female, which explains Karin from team taka.\nYuugo saw him as Kimimaros successor and wanted to help and protect him for that reason.\nOrochimaru at first wanted only his eyes and therefor trained him so he gains all the power when he overtakes Sasukes body.\nWhy he likes Sasuke in the end? He probably values the strength Sasuke gained and how he got there. Just like himself Sasuke is a nuke nin that experienced the world from a different view than a villager.\n\nHashirama, as Ashuras heir and Madaras eternal nemesis, probably felt the whole Indra bullshittery and also his arcnemesis and the worst villains of the show are Uchiha so he probably wasn\u2019t to keen on antagonizing him like Tobirama.\n\n\nNaruto basically had the same story except from the village point of view and while most \u201efriends\u201c didn\u2019t accept him at first there is a reason why \u201etalk no jutsu\u201c exists and that\u2019s because he Someone managed to defuse most bad guys with his words.",

I mean, come on Sasuke stabbed Karin and abandoned Jugo and Suigetsu and they all crawled back to him anyways. Lmao\n\nBut Orochimaru's situation will never not be insulting because once upon a time, he was a real character with his own agency. An in-character Orochimaru would have used Edo Tensei Tobirama/Hiruzen/Minato to destroy Sasuke and get on with his life.\n\nI remind you Sasuke threatened to commit genocide on the village if the Hokage didn't cater to his demands. Tobirama's reaction was totally understandable. Hashirama's sob story had no real impact. If anything, Tobirama's straightforward mannerism and words convinced Sasuke to be calmer for now since he learnt about his clan's curse and all.\n\nHis thing with Naruto is beliavable and I think the redemption thing was rushed but it could have been worse. *cough* Obito *cough*",

He tells Naruto \"kill me and be a hero, or become one of my victims\" \n\nThen he meets Itachi again, and says something along the lines of \"Why only me? What's different about me versus or father or mother? Why did you spare only me?\" \n\nIt came across like he wished he died with the rest of the clan, and that he kind of resented Itachi for leaving him with the guilt and burden of being the remaining Uchiha.\n\nCant believe Ben 10 said that \ud83d\ude2d",

An in-character Orochimaru would have used Edo Tensei Tobirama/Hiruzen/Minato to destroy Sasuke and get on with his life.\n\nI remind you Sasuke threatened to commit genocide on the village if the Hokage didn't cater to his demands. Tobirama's reaction was totally understandable. Hashirama's sob story had no real impact. If anything, Tobirama's straightforward mannerism and words convinced Sasuke to be calmer for now since he learnt about his clan's curse and all.\n\nHis thing with Naruto is beliavable and I think the redemption thing was rushed but it could have been worse. *cough* Obito *cough*",

He tells Naruto \"kill me and be a hero, or become one of my victims\" \n\nThen he meets Itachi again, and says something along the lines of \"Why only me? What's different about me versus or father or mother? Why did you spare only me?\" \n\nIt came across like he wished he died with the rest of the clan, and that he kind of resented Itachi for leaving him with the guilt and burden of being the remaining Uchiha.\n\nCant believe Ben 10 said that \ud83d\ude2d",

He probably values the strength Sasuke gained and how he got there.

An in-character Orochimaru would have used Edo Tensei Tobirama/Hiruzen/Minato to destroy Sasuke and get on with his life.\n\nI remind you Sasuke threatened to commit genocide on the village if the Hokage didn't cater to his demands. Tobirama's reaction was totally understandable. Hashirama's sob story had no real impact. If anything, Tobirama's straightforward mannerism and words convinced Sasuke to be calmer for now since he learnt about his clan's curse and all.\n\nHis thing with Naruto is beliavable and I think the redemption thing was rushed but it could have been worse. *cough* Obito *cough*",

Nah let's have his victim's grandson interview him for the wedding video of our hero, you know, really let the victim's grandson learn how the killer feels. Then let's invite him to the wedding. I know, let's seat the killer of the third hokage next to the sixth. That will surely be fine.\n\nOh and after all let's let this child abducting human experimenting insane snake boy have a large laboratory and just let him be.

He probably values the strength Sasuke gained and how he got there. Just like himself Sasuke is a nuke nin that experienced the world from a different view than a villager.\n\nHashirama, as Ashuras heir and Madaras eternal nemesis, probably felt the whole Indra bullshittery and also his arcnemesis and the worst villains of the show are Uchiha so he probably wasn\u2019t to keen on antagonizing him like Tobirama.\n\n\nNaruto basically had the same story except from the village point of view and while most \u201efriends\u201c didn\u2019t accept him at first there is a reason why \u201etalk no jutsu\u201c exists and that\u2019s because he Someone managed to defuse most bad guys with his words.",

An in-character Orochimaru would have used Edo Tensei Tobirama/Hiruzen/Minato to destroy Sasuke and get on with his life.\n\nI remind you Sasuke threatened to commit genocide on the village if the Hokage didn't cater to his demands. Tobirama's reaction was totally understandable. Hashirama's sob story had no real impact. If anything, Tobirama's straightforward mannerism and words convinced Sasuke to be calmer for now since he learnt about his clan's curse and all.\n\nHis thing with Naruto is beliavable and I think the redemption thing was rushed but it could have been worse. *cough* Obito *cough*",

Lmao\n\nBut Orochimaru's situation will never not be insulting because once upon a time, he was a real character with his own agency. An in-character Orochimaru would have used Edo Tensei Tobirama/Hiruzen/Minato to destroy Sasuke and get on with his life.\n\nI remind you Sasuke threatened to commit genocide on the village if the Hokage didn't cater to his demands. Tobirama's reaction was totally understandable. Hashirama's sob story had no real impact. If anything, Tobirama's straightforward mannerism and words convinced Sasuke to be calmer for now since he learnt about his clan's curse and all.\n\nHis thing with Naruto is beliavable and I think the redemption thing was rushed but it could have been worse. *cough* Obito *cough*",
