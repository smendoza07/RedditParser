    "body": "More of a rant, I\u2019m just annoyed. \nI cut off my SD yesterday. We\u2019ve been seeing one another since June and came to agreement that once we became intimate, I\u2019d receive an allowance. Guess what didn\u2019t happen?\n\nI\u2019m frustrated because he has been paying my rent and I enjoy his company but getting him to spoil me is like pulling nails from wood. He says we\u2019re not \u201cintimate\u201d because we\u2019ve only had sex twice and not consistently. Which is his fault because he still lets the mother of his children come around and stay at his house when she is oblivious to our relationship. She stayed the entire month of October while we would sneak and do lunch dates maybe 3 times the entire month.\n\nHe wants me to be available whenever at the spur of the moment and I always am! I work full time and have taken lunch later or early as hell to accommodate, early morning breakfast dates, late night last minute dinners, etc. We text damn near everyday which again, I enjoyed doing but I don\u2019t see how we\u2019re not intimate when I\u2019m sending him spicy videos and pictures every other day as well as FaceTiming so he can get his.\n\nWhat pisses me off the most? He keeps accusing me of sleeping with someone else which I should have been!\n\nI have the beg him at the end of each month to give me rent money that he agreed to in the beginning. And he doesn\u2019t believe in Cashapp so if I don\u2019t see him in person, I don\u2019t get it. \n\nMy last straw was yesterday. I asked if he could buy me a fairly cheap bracelet and he told me he wasn\u2019t \u201cready to give me any gifts\u201d I would have preferred he just said no. He can go to hell.",

I've been successfully sugaring for 20 years.\n\nMuch of your language describes herculean effort on your part and assigns all the blame on him... including \"trying to get him to \\*spoil\\* you\" and \"having to go see him to get your rent money\".  The former suggests a tireless pattern of behavior and the latter suggests that maybe going to see him was a burden.  I was offering that there's an opportunity to look at your own behavior and learn how you might have better relationships; sugar or otherwise.\n\nConsider the possibility that he feels he's the hero in his story and he's holding out because he has some gripe (it's probably not the sex thing; I'm confident that's just an excuse... maybe he over-promised and simply can't make good, so he's milking it?).  And if money is his real problem, then the behaviors you described probably come off as hustling or nagging.  \n\n\nEither way, I totally support dumping him.  He needs to be a better communicator if he's the \"good guy\" and coach you on whatever his problem is.  And he needs to do better by you, regardless.  He should be paying you in advance of the month; not making you come to him for scraps; that's just exploiting the power dynamic in a toxic way.  \nIf you want to hold yourself blameless, I have no horse in that race.",

I didn\u2019t purposely word the post to blame him it was simply framed around my frustrations with the relationship. I\u2019ve commented multiple times how much I adore seeing him but when we are both working and he is playing house with a woman he told me no longer lives with him, it makes it harder to see him. And if I don\u2019t see him, I don\u2019t get my rent. Which of course I can pay it myself with my job and I have and he\u2019s paid me back but that makes it feel like it\u2019s not a priority for him. He\u2019s not a burden at all. We have a lot of fun with one another. And his pockets definitely aren\u2019t shallow so I don\u2019t think money is the issue. I commented on another\u2019s post earlier that I tried to talk with him twice about what the hold up was. He\u2019s doesn\u2019t communicate well. I truthfully think he doesn\u2019t want to invest too much into me because he is insecure and thinks I\u2019m sleeping with other men. I don\u2019t know what I can do to change his mind about that. Even when I send him videos, he asks if he\u2019s the only person to have seen it. He won\u2019t admit to that (which I\u2019m just assuming is the issue since the last time we were together he suggested he go through my phone).",

You\u2019re not in an ideal relationship and these situations should be hard or stressful for you. Your daddy *should want* to spoil you, it\u2019s honestly not spoiling IMO if you have to ask. I\u2019ve never once had to ask my SD for anything, and if I had to put in \u201cwork\u201d like it sounds like you are it would strain the relationship and not be something I would put myself or him through. His poor communication and inconsistency is a red flag, the fact that he makes you feel like it\u2019s your job to \u2018earn & collect\u2019 money from him is icky. He may have money but is isn\u2019t sharing it with you, he sounds like a burden to us. We aren\u2019t trying to argue with you and your defensiveness about the situation is concerning because we can see that you are emotionally invested where you really shouldn\u2019t be. Someday someone if going to care for you and spoil you, it should be this hard for either of you",

But then when I ask for things he already promised, he says he\u2019s not \u201cready.\u201d That\u2019s always his excuse, not being ready. He tries to play mind games, however. We initially just agreed to oral bc he said he felt guilty being with another woman other than his child\u2019s mother (although they were together off and on for 30years, only lived together for 2 and never married. He also had 5 children on her if that tells you anything). Well he bought condoms and would book hotels just to \u201ccuddle\u201d and never outright said he wanted sex. To this day, as sexual as we are, he dances around the subject. If I am overtly sexual, he accuses me of being with someone else. Im not sure if he wanted to call it off honestly. He seemed to not be able to get enough of me. We\u2019ve started back hanging out full speed up until yesterday when I called it off.",

I apartmented an SB a decade ago who constantly begged for extras and would steal loose cash from my wallet and coat when she handled them.  And then she'd complain that I wanted sex all the time.  It got so bad, I dreaded going to see her and I was relieved when she bolted and left me with an unfulfilled lease.\n\nMaybe he picks the same kinds of toxic relationships and sees you as the next nag in the chain.  Maybe he hoped someone shiny and new would be different.\n\nI would reflect on whether/how you might be making him reluctant to commit to the agreed upon \"full allowance\".  But I stand by \"dump him\"... he needs to be better.",

I've been successfully sugaring for 20 years.\n\nMuch of your language describes herculean effort on your part and assigns all the blame on him... including \"trying to get him to \\*spoil\\* you\" and \"having to go see him to get your rent money\".  The former suggests a tireless pattern of behavior and the latter suggests that maybe going to see him was a burden.  I was offering that there's an opportunity to look at your own behavior and learn how you might have better relationships; sugar or otherwise.\n\nConsider the possibility that he feels he's the hero in his story and he's holding out because he has some gripe (it's probably not the sex thing; I'm confident that's just an excuse... maybe he over-promised and simply can't make good, so he's milking it?).  And if money is his real problem, then the behaviors you described probably come off as hustling or nagging.  \n\n\nEither way, I totally support dumping him.  He needs to be a better communicator if he's the \"good guy\" and coach you on whatever his problem is.  And he needs to do better by you, regardless.  He should be paying you in advance of the month; not making you come to him for scraps; that's just exploiting the power dynamic in a toxic way.  \nIf you want to hold yourself blameless, I have no horse in that race.",

I\u2019ve commented multiple times how much I adore seeing him but when we are both working and he is playing house with a woman he told me no longer lives with him, it makes it harder to see him. And if I don\u2019t see him, I don\u2019t get my rent. Which of course I can pay it myself with my job and I have and he\u2019s paid me back but that makes it feel like it\u2019s not a priority for him. He\u2019s not a burden at all. We have a lot of fun with one another. And his pockets definitely aren\u2019t shallow so I don\u2019t think money is the issue. I commented on another\u2019s post earlier that I tried to talk with him twice about what the hold up was. He\u2019s doesn\u2019t communicate well. I truthfully think he doesn\u2019t want to invest too much into me because he is insecure and thinks I\u2019m sleeping with other men. I don\u2019t know what I can do to change his mind about that. Even when I send him videos, he asks if he\u2019s the only person to have seen it. He won\u2019t admit to that (which I\u2019m just assuming is the issue since the last time we were together he suggested he go through my phone).",

The higher up you go the more cutthroat they get. \n\nOf celebrity wealthy men, for all Mark Zuckerberg's faults, one thing you can't criticize him for is his personal relationships - he stuck by his (frankly not very attractive) college sweetheart wife. Warren Buffet, too (until she passed away). That's just exceedingly rare to see and require a lot of cicumstances (and luck on Zuckerberg's part) to happen.\n\nYou might still see honest men with integrity it the same proportion to the general population at the 200-300k income range, because that's what an engineer or middle manager at FAANG makes and the bar to get there isn't terribly high, but any higher income than that be prepared to be skewed towards much more cutthorat and dishonest people, percentage wise. Especially if he's cheating on his wife, don't expect him to be honest with his SB (not saying that's the case for your SD, but it certainly sounds complicated).",

I\u2019ve never once had to ask my SD for anything, and if I had to put in \u201cwork\u201d like it sounds like you are it would strain the relationship and not be something I would put myself or him through. His poor communication and inconsistency is a red flag, the fact that he makes you feel like it\u2019s your job to \u2018earn & collect\u2019 money from him is icky. He may have money but is isn\u2019t sharing it with you, he sounds like a burden to us. We aren\u2019t trying to argue with you and your defensiveness about the situation is concerning because we can see that you are emotionally invested where you really shouldn\u2019t be.

He offers some things like my birthday is coming up in February and he told me to send him over the numbers for a trip. But then when I ask for things he already promised, he says he\u2019s not \u201cready.\u201d That\u2019s always his excuse, not being ready. He tries to play mind games, however. We initially just agreed to oral bc he said he felt guilty being with another woman other than his child\u2019s mother (although they were together off and on for 30years, only lived together for 2 and never married. He also had 5 children on her if that tells you anything). Well he bought condoms and would book hotels just to \u201ccuddle\u201d and never outright said he wanted sex. To this day, as sexual as we are, he dances around the subject. If I am overtly sexual, he accuses me of being with someone else. Im not sure if he wanted to call it off honestly. He seemed to not be able to get enough of me. We\u2019ve started back hanging out full speed up until yesterday when I called it off.",

I was also FaceTiming and sending ten times more sexual videos and pictures. He promised a higher amount in allowance than my rent back in June but has only been paying my rent. 3.84 times higher if we\u2019re doing the math. I didn\u2019t ever ask for more, but I asked for a bracelet yesterday to which he replied he wasn\u2019t ready to give me any gifts. The bracelet literally cost less than the shots of tequila he orders at the bar. No exaggeration. During the entire month of October he was also super possessive and would make up me sleeping with someone else and get mad. Asking to go through my phone etc.\n\nEdit: \n\nHe can very well afford the allowance which makes him stingy. As I mentioned, his bar tabs alone are half the monthly allowance he promised.",

I've been successfully sugaring for 20 years.\n\nMuch of your language describes herculean effort on your part and assigns all the blame on him... including \"trying to get him to \\*spoil\\* you\" and \"having to go see him to get your rent money\".  The former suggests a tireless pattern of behavior and the latter suggests that maybe going to see him was a burden.  I was offering that there's an opportunity to look at your own behavior and learn how you might have better relationships; sugar or otherwise.\n\nConsider the possibility that he feels he's the hero in his story and he's holding out because he has some gripe (it's probably not the sex thing; I'm confident that's just an excuse... maybe he over-promised and simply can't make good, so he's milking it?).  And if money is his real problem, then the behaviors you described probably come off as hustling or nagging.  \n\n\nEither way, I totally support dumping him.  He needs to be a better communicator if he's the \"good guy\" and coach you on whatever his problem is.  And he needs to do better by you, regardless.  He should be paying you in advance of the month; not making you come to him for scraps; that's just exploiting the power dynamic in a toxic way.  \nIf you want to hold yourself blameless, I have no horse in that race.",

I didn\u2019t purposely word the post to blame him it was simply framed around my frustrations with the relationship. I\u2019ve commented multiple times how much I adore seeing him but when we are both working and he is playing house with a woman he told me no longer lives with him, it makes it harder to see him. And if I don\u2019t see him, I don\u2019t get my rent. Which of course I can pay it myself with my job and I have and he\u2019s paid me back but that makes it feel like it\u2019s not a priority for him. He\u2019s not a burden at all. We have a lot of fun with one another. And his pockets definitely aren\u2019t shallow so I don\u2019t think money is the issue. I commented on another\u2019s post earlier that I tried to talk with him twice about what the hold up was. He\u2019s doesn\u2019t communicate well. I truthfully think he doesn\u2019t want to invest too much into me because he is insecure and thinks I\u2019m sleeping with other men. I don\u2019t know what I can do to change his mind about that. Even when I send him videos, he asks if he\u2019s the only person to have seen it. He won\u2019t admit to that (which I\u2019m just assuming is the issue since the last time we were together he suggested he go through my phone).",

Warren Buffet, too (until she passed away). That's just exceedingly rare to see and require a lot of cicumstances (and luck on Zuckerberg's part) to happen.\n\nYou might still see honest men with integrity it the same proportion to the general population at the 200-300k income range, because that's what an engineer or middle manager at FAANG makes and the bar to get there isn't terribly high, but any higher income than that be prepared to be skewed towards much more cutthorat and dishonest people, percentage wise. Especially if he's cheating on his wife, don't expect him to be honest with his SB (not saying that's the case for your SD, but it certainly sounds complicated).",

I've been successfully sugaring for 20 years.\n\nMuch of your language describes herculean effort on your part and assigns all the blame on him... including \"trying to get him to \\*spoil\\* you\" and \"having to go see him to get your rent money\".  The former suggests a tireless pattern of behavior and the latter suggests that maybe going to see him was a burden.  I was offering that there's an opportunity to look at your own behavior and learn how you might have better relationships; sugar or otherwise.\n\nConsider the possibility that he feels he's the hero in his story and he's holding out because he has some gripe (it's probably not the sex thing; I'm confident that's just an excuse... maybe he over-promised and simply can't make good, so he's milking it?).  And if money is his real problem, then the behaviors you described probably come off as hustling or nagging.  \n\n\nEither way, I totally support dumping him.  He needs to be a better communicator if he's the \"good guy\" and coach you on whatever his problem is.  And he needs to do better by you, regardless.  He should be paying you in advance of the month; not making you come to him for scraps; that's just exploiting the power dynamic in a toxic way.  \nIf you want to hold yourself blameless, I have no horse in that race.",

I didn\u2019t purposely word the post to blame him it was simply framed around my frustrations with the relationship. I\u2019ve commented multiple times how much I adore seeing him but when we are both working and he is playing house with a woman he told me no longer lives with him, it makes it harder to see him. And if I don\u2019t see him, I don\u2019t get my rent. Which of course I can pay it myself with my job and I have and he\u2019s paid me back but that makes it feel like it\u2019s not a priority for him. He\u2019s not a burden at all. We have a lot of fun with one another. And his pockets definitely aren\u2019t shallow so I don\u2019t think money is the issue. I commented on another\u2019s post earlier that I tried to talk with him twice about what the hold up was. He\u2019s doesn\u2019t communicate well. I truthfully think he doesn\u2019t want to invest too much into me because he is insecure and thinks I\u2019m sleeping with other men. I don\u2019t know what I can do to change his mind about that. Even when I send him videos, he asks if he\u2019s the only person to have seen it. He won\u2019t admit to that (which I\u2019m just assuming is the issue since the last time we were together he suggested he go through my phone).",

The former suggests a tireless pattern of behavior and the latter suggests that maybe going to see him was a burden.  I was offering that there's an opportunity to look at your own behavior and learn how you might have better relationships; sugar or otherwise.\n\nConsider the possibility that he feels he's the hero in his story and he's holding out because he has some gripe (it's probably not the sex thing; I'm confident that's just an excuse... maybe he over-promised and simply can't make good, so he's milking it?).  And if money is his real problem, then the behaviors you described probably come off as hustling or nagging.  \n\n\nEither way, I totally support dumping him.  He needs to be a better communicator if he's the \"good guy\" and coach you on whatever his problem is.  And he needs to do better by you, regardless.  He should be paying you in advance of the month; not making you come to him for scraps; that's just exploiting the power dynamic in a toxic way.  \nIf you want to hold yourself blameless, I have no horse in that race.",

I\u2019ve commented multiple times how much I adore seeing him but when we are both working and he is playing house with a woman he told me no longer lives with him, it makes it harder to see him. And if I don\u2019t see him, I don\u2019t get my rent. Which of course I can pay it myself with my job and I have and he\u2019s paid me back but that makes it feel like it\u2019s not a priority for him. He\u2019s not a burden at all. We have a lot of fun with one another. And his pockets definitely aren\u2019t shallow so I don\u2019t think money is the issue. I commented on another\u2019s post earlier that I tried to talk with him twice about what the hold up was. He\u2019s doesn\u2019t communicate well. I truthfully think he doesn\u2019t want to invest too much into me because he is insecure and thinks I\u2019m sleeping with other men. I don\u2019t know what I can do to change his mind about that. Even when I send him videos, he asks if he\u2019s the only person to have seen it. He won\u2019t admit to that (which I\u2019m just assuming is the issue since the last time we were together he suggested he go through my phone).",

Your daddy *should want* to spoil you, it\u2019s honestly not spoiling IMO if you have to ask. I\u2019ve never once had to ask my SD for anything, and if I had to put in \u201cwork\u201d like it sounds like you are it would strain the relationship and not be something I would put myself or him through. His poor communication and inconsistency is a red flag, the fact that he makes you feel like it\u2019s your job to \u2018earn & collect\u2019 money from him is icky. He may have money but is isn\u2019t sharing it with you, he sounds like a burden to us. We aren\u2019t trying to argue with you and your defensiveness about the situation is concerning because we can see that you are emotionally invested where you really shouldn\u2019t be. Someday someone if going to care for you and spoil you, it should be this hard for either of you",

I\u2019ve commented multiple times how much I adore seeing him but when we are both working and he is playing house with a woman he told me no longer lives with him, it makes it harder to see him. And if I don\u2019t see him, I don\u2019t get my rent. Which of course I can pay it myself with my job and I have and he\u2019s paid me back but that makes it feel like it\u2019s not a priority for him. He\u2019s not a burden at all. We have a lot of fun with one another. And his pockets definitely aren\u2019t shallow so I don\u2019t think money is the issue. I commented on another\u2019s post earlier that I tried to talk with him twice about what the hold up was. He\u2019s doesn\u2019t communicate well. I truthfully think he doesn\u2019t want to invest too much into me because he is insecure and thinks I\u2019m sleeping with other men. I don\u2019t know what I can do to change his mind about that. Even when I send him videos, he asks if he\u2019s the only person to have seen it. He won\u2019t admit to that (which I\u2019m just assuming is the issue since the last time we were together he suggested he go through my phone).",

Warren Buffet, too (until she passed away). That's just exceedingly rare to see and require a lot of cicumstances (and luck on Zuckerberg's part) to happen.\n\nYou might still see honest men with integrity it the same proportion to the general population at the 200-300k income range, because that's what an engineer or middle manager at FAANG makes and the bar to get there isn't terribly high, but any higher income than that be prepared to be skewed towards much more cutthorat and dishonest people, percentage wise. Especially if he's cheating on his wife, don't expect him to be honest with his SB (not saying that's the case for your SD, but it certainly sounds complicated).",

Warren Buffet, too (until she passed away). That's just exceedingly rare to see and require a lot of cicumstances (and luck on Zuckerberg's part) to happen.\n\nYou might still see honest men with integrity it the same proportion to the general population at the 200-300k income range, because that's what an engineer or middle manager at FAANG makes and the bar to get there isn't terribly high, but any higher income than that be prepared to be skewed towards much more cutthorat and dishonest people, percentage wise. Especially if he's cheating on his wife, don't expect him to be honest with his SB (not saying that's the case for your SD, but it certainly sounds complicated).",
