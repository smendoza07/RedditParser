    "body": "I met a guy on here and he turned out to be a complete scam (not surprising). \n\nHe proceeded to tell me how the arrangements went with his previous SBs. I asked him for pictures of him and he sent two. I sent him a picture too but nothing showed my face. \n\nAfter messaging for about two weeks he tells me that he wants to send me $1,000 but in order to do so, he needs my \u201caccount number ? Routine number? And also the online log in details \nI need to check your transaction to determine how much I can send,to avoid getting your account blocked and you don\u2019t need to worry it\u2019s impossible to move money out of your account without it being traced or better still you could just move what you got there else where\u201d\n\nY\u2019all \ud83d\ude02 I laughed so hard. People really are crazy.",

So, while I'm bummed you had this experience, I'm also glad you effortlessly saw and avoided the scam (and awesome if slf helped you identify it), small victory for the good gals&guys.\n\nThe problem here is that slf mods can't see your DMs, and if we started taking action against people based on DMs, it would be a total hesaid/shesaid.  The guy who tried to scam you could come on this thread and say \"no that's not what happened, she tried to con me, here's what happened\", and we'd have no way of knowing who was telling the truth.  Screenshots of conversations are easily synthesized.  So what happens in your DMs is your business, I suggest some caution in who everyone interacts with over DM.  Your (generic you) DM interactions are on you, there's no slf mod guardrails, and with almost 80k members, there's scammers attracted to slf, and all sugar subs for that matter.\n\nIt's the reddit admins who have authority over this, and that's who I'd advise you report this to.  I'm honestly not certain what they'd do.  I'm also going to page u/lasirene to get a more experienced read here.",
