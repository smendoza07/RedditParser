I've used Cash App but never for ppms, only when an SB asks me for immediate help and I'm not around.\n\nI'm also one who calls sugar what it is, a form of soft prostitution.  Not even that soft.  And SA facilitates the connections.  \n\nBut if it was going to be shut down, I expect it would have by now from worse stuff.  I mean, there have been more serious crimes than this facilitated through SA interactions.  Murders, extortions and such.  There was a girl from Utah murdered in 2019.  They met through SA.\n\nBut for most of us, we are not involved in financial crimes and whatnot. The FBI is not interested that a guy in Peoria pays his mistress. They ARE interested in politicians who took public money, bought Bitcoin, and incidentally used some of that on SBs including a 17 year old one.\n\nSA is relevant in the Gaetz case because it was part of all his shenanigans, not THE shenanigan.",

And just look the statistics about SD/SB ration. It's the offer and demand thing. U are in the right to know what u want but the reality is different. And men, specially this kind don't come on this website to deal with drama. So if u are a drama in your profile (like it seems by reading it) or in mp.

That went to the feds, then they found wire fraud, misuse of public funds, THEN they found the sex trafficking of a minor and Gaetz was connected.\n\nHad Gaetz *just* been on SA, we would never have heard of it.",

I mean, there have been more serious crimes than this facilitated through SA interactions.  Murders, extortions and such.  There was a girl from Utah murdered in 2019.  They met through SA.\n\nBut for most of us, we are not involved in financial crimes and whatnot. The FBI is not interested that a guy in Peoria pays his mistress.

We\u2019re never speaking from the same hymn note. \n\nHow many men lie to women and dangle the marriage carrot only because she wants that more than anything and will subsequently give her all to him? LOTS. Same rule can be applied to the lonely men on SA looking for and willing to compensate a girl for her time and intimacy. Men on SA think they\u2019re exempt from being \u201cthe needy\u201d....reality is they\u2019re not.",

The opponent went to his lawyer.  That went to the feds, then they found wire fraud, misuse of public funds, THEN they found the sex trafficking of a minor and Gaetz was connected.\n\nHad Gaetz *just* been on SA, we would never have heard of it.",

I mean, there have been more serious crimes than this facilitated through SA interactions.  Murders, extortions and such.  There was a girl from Utah murdered in 2019.  They met through SA.\n\nBut for most of us, we are not involved in financial crimes and whatnot. The FBI is not interested that a guy in Peoria pays his mistress. They ARE interested in politicians who took public money, bought Bitcoin, and incidentally used some of that on SBs including a 17 year old one.\n\nSA is relevant in the Gaetz case because it was part of all his shenanigans, not THE shenanigan.",

I've used Cash App but never for ppms, only when an SB asks me for immediate help and I'm not around.\n\nI'm also one who calls sugar what it is, a form of soft prostitution.  Not even that soft.  And SA facilitates the connections.  \n\nBut if it was going to be shut down, I expect it would have by now from worse stuff.  I mean, there have been more serious crimes than this facilitated through SA interactions.  Murders, extortions and such.  There was a girl from Utah murdered in 2019.  They met through SA.\n\nBut for most of us, we are not involved in financial crimes and whatnot. The FBI is not interested that a guy in Peoria pays his mistress. They ARE interested in politicians who took public money, bought Bitcoin, and incidentally used some of that on SBs including a 17 year old one.\n\nSA is relevant in the Gaetz case because it was part of all his shenanigans, not THE shenanigan.",

I've used Cash App but never for ppms, only when an SB asks me for immediate help and I'm not around.\n\nI'm also one who calls sugar what it is, a form of soft prostitution.  Not even that soft.  And SA facilitates the connections.  \n\nBut if it was going to be shut down, I expect it would have by now from worse stuff.  I mean, there have been more serious crimes than this facilitated through SA interactions.  Murders, extortions and such.  There was a girl from Utah murdered in 2019.  They met through SA.\n\nBut for most of us, we are not involved in financial crimes and whatnot. The FBI is not interested that a guy in Peoria pays his mistress. They ARE interested in politicians who took public money, bought Bitcoin, and incidentally used some of that on SBs including a 17 year old one.\n\nSA is relevant in the Gaetz case because it was part of all his shenanigans, not THE shenanigan.",
