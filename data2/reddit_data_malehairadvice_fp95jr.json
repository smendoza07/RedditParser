Dht is like a cheap substitute for testosterone at 40s your body can't produce the same testosterone of back at the day when you had 18 so in order for you to survive and still be a man your body produces a shit load of dht trying to compensate lack of testosterone. Finasteride will block this dht but what the heck are you going to do when you hit 40s lacking both testosterone and DHT? To solve this you must hop on testosterone replacement therapy and then you can be an old man with the testosterone of a 20 year old man, feeling great, jacked like Silvester stalone and mostly important... with a shit load of hair on your scalp! \ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\udc4c",

If you ask a finasteride user how young they wish they had started they all say 16 before even start loosing hair is the best time. Even if you wouldn't have any hair loss and you have blessed genetics is still worth it to keep the hair, unless you look good with this soldier haircut I forgot the name",

Dht is like a cheap substitute for testosterone at 40s your body can't produce the same testosterone of back at the day when you had 18 so in order for you to survive and still be a man your body produces a shit load of dht trying to compensate lack of testosterone. Finasteride will block this dht but what the heck are you going to do when you hit 40s lacking both testosterone and DHT? To solve this you must hop on testosterone replacement therapy and then you can be an old man with the testosterone of a 20 year old man, feeling great, jacked like Silvester stalone and mostly important... with a shit load of hair on your scalp! \ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\udc4c",

If you ask a finasteride user how young they wish they had started they all say 16 before even start loosing hair is the best time.

Dht is like a cheap substitute for testosterone at 40s your body can't produce the same testosterone of back at the day when you had 18 so in order for you to survive and still be a man your body produces a shit load of dht trying to compensate lack of testosterone. Finasteride will block this dht but what the heck are you going to do when you hit 40s lacking both testosterone and DHT? To solve this you must hop on testosterone replacement therapy and then you can be an old man with the testosterone of a 20 year old man, feeling great, jacked like Silvester stalone and mostly important... with a shit load of hair on your scalp! \ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\udc4c",
