As for the top, maybe a pompadour kind of style? Just involves getting some more length and having it go sideways and back. Whereas you have a haircut that's very popular for your age, I'd say a pompadour is very popular for someone college aged, so maybe you'll seem badass?\n\nAlso, maybe look into an undercut fade. Doesn't change too much and less growth required but still looks a bit different",

            "body": "The current style suits. In terms of what changes can be made to the current style, suggest slightly raising the part. With the current length on top, the back and sides could suit a well blended semi-short, medium or long taper. It appears as if the back/sides of the style in the photo may have been cut as some type of undercut variant and have then grown out a bit, hard to say without being able to see the other side. In any event, the style  now appears to be a regular haircut with the back/sides in the medium to long taper range. The top can be worn longer or shorter as long as it complements the length of the taper on the back/sides. Therefore, even in the realm of regular haircuts, there is opportunity to switch it up by varying the length of the top and the length of the taper on the back/sides.  \n\nlong taper...\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/GUb9Y9o.jpg\n\nmedium taper...\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/3LO5NKv.jpg\n\nsemi-short taper...\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/McaeVf3.jpg\n\nWith regard to a more significant change of style, always an easier decision to switch it up longer  because a guy can always switch back immediately to a prior shorter style. For a style that would completely obscure the ears would take about five to six months grow out time, assuming an average rate of hair growth of 1/8\" per week. For a longer style, maybe something like this...\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/07W3He9.jpg\n\nWith regard to switching it up shorter, guys who usually wear regular haircuts often switch to shorter styles for the summer. \n\nhttps://books.google.com/books?id=gEwEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA46#v=onepage&q&f=false\n\nGiven the limited information available from the photo - hair type; hair density(hairs per square inch); hair coarseness(diameter of each hair), frontal hairline; eye brow shape; superciliary arch; ear size, shape, and degree of protrusion - among the standard short styles(ivy league, crew cut, flat top crew cut, butch, burr(short butch), brush cut(long butch), forward brush) - can state that unless the face shape and features deviate significantly from average, aesthetically, an ivy league, crew cut or flat top crew cut can be designed to  suit...\n\nivy league...\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/9RwV1HK.jpg\n\nmedium crew cut...\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/57Gg9ig.jpg\n\nshort crew cut...\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Ux3Qd8o.jpg\n\nflat top crew cut, blonde guys in center of each row...\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/nqxWsPu.jpg\n\nshort flat top crew cut, guy on the right...\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/XyNUckI.jpg\n\n...as well as a regular haircut.
