It could easily be a 100 ep anime which would end with Hashi vs Madara Final valley battle with Momoshiki fight level animation.

Get's his hand slashed by Obito (uncontrolled jin) whereas Tobirama was able to land to major hits to Perfect controlled Jin state. Don't forget that Tobirama was better than KCM2 Minato which means he's leagues above Hokage Minato (feat wise). KCM makes up Minato's nerf and still makes him hellla stronger and faster whereas Tobirama's speed is just nerfed. Minato created Rasengan but we all know a 1000 times better user. Had 2 of his students killed and one got PTSD. Kinda was not able to save Kushina. Could've saved her if he put the other inside her and not him ( she would've survived just like Naruto did), which makes him hella stupid because he is going to die anyways. Fought 14yr old Kid Obito and almost got thrashed (Obito had trained only 1 year prior the fight so let's not talk about any other  version of Obito). Made his son an outcast and the ONLY FUCKING REASON HE HAS IS So ThAt hE CoUlD MaSEtR iT to FiGHt a guy he technically himself couldn't defeat. When you think about it, this is a major plothole. With Minato's logic, Obito would've come back the next week and this time it would be even more easy because this time it's just a kid and a geezer. So Naruto dies. Entrusting something that almost no man(alive) on Earth (including himself) couldn't achieve (which is defeating FUCKING MADARA UCHIHA) and just saying I believe in you only puts the world's pressure on him as if it's his duty. Even Jiraiya didn't want to strain the goal of peace on Naruto. He just wanted to pass it on and wanted him to try as well and he was only certain that Naruto would be able to do so prior his death. Topping Academy Results also don't make him any great , Kakashi was 5 when he became Genin (ik it was war time but still becaus no one else but only he passed and even after that no one was able to catch up for years) Imagine 10 yr old Kakashi almost a jounin sitting for kid's Genin exam. He But it's not like I dislike him, he's cool. Okay, but seriously I don't dislike him for all these points, some are just reasons for not giving him the show. But seriously I don't think any parent would wanna make their child a jin knowing that that beast killed 1000s of civilians and shinobi prior the sealing (even Kushina was opposed to this). The treatment Naruto got is just unbearable to watch although it is Hiruzen's fault as a Hokage but also Minato's because there is just no fucking way the people of the village would forgive a beast who killed their precious loved ones (thanks to Naruto and himself even KURAMA got salvation). Edit: idk what i said wrong but it people are downvoting me, seems like they also like to see Naruto being an outcast.",

Do your homework, try Googling what Minato used Hiraishin or Shunsin (even try to hear it). Don't disrespect Kishimotos writings. Even if you don't want to believe it which ik most people wouldn't, still you can't disagree on the fact that Tobirama had better feats against Obito. Infact, everything I said is true. Just tell me one thing that's flawed. And also Obito is Obito, Minato is nothing without FTG compared to his FTG self, sharingan is essentially a part of the COPY NINJA and the Uchihas, KURAMA for Naruto, wood for hashi and similarly hashi cells for Obito.

Naruto was able to heal a hole, no a hole in shoulder by Sasuke's chidori. Mind you this was just (yang) Kurama leaking bits of his chakra. Kushina was able to move and talk (Talked to Naruto and Hiruzen) even after Kurama was sealed. Kushina herself has shown capable of restraining Kurama, so even if half of him was sealed, she would've survived. Even if you ignore that, bits would be enough to regenerate the part similarly like Naruto did because Kurama doesn't wanna die.\n\n\n\n\nThrashed Obito, yes but no. Minato had himself that the one who makes their move even a single milli second faster would win. Obito prior the main fight (after Minato dodged the first one) said he would use Kamui even more faster (indicating he will surely suck minato this time). So it wouldn't be correct to say that it was an easy win. \n\n\n\nCould've come back anytime. Easily scales aboves Hiruzen in speed and thus stronger than him. Hiruzen doesn't have any counter Kamui nor does he have the reaction speed to perform one. Even if you ignore this, we know Obito many a time checked the stone tablet using Kamui. Obito was also able to Kamui himself behind Naruto in Five Kage Summit Arc, he does the same and it's done for Naruto. No one to stop him. Kamui is pretty much broken.\nI am really interested to see if you have any counter arguments to that.",

This has nothing to do with Minatos skill or intelligence. It\u2019s just\u2026 how it was written. \n\nWell, you\u2019re the one who said Obito thrashed Minato? I just repeated your words never said it was an easy win. Minato did, factually, one shot Obito who only survived because of Hashirama cells which are OP. AND he figured out Obito la abilities after being attacked once, THATS the real feat here. \n\nKamui broken? Yes. But a whole village of elite ninja would take out ONE guy. Remember he was 13 or so, only reason he did so well the first time was because of the nine tails. The 5 Kage summit is 16 years later when he\u2019s much stronger. \n\nBeing able to kamui to an abandoned secret location out in the forests of the abandoned uchiha clan isnt a feat. He basically just snuck in, doesn\u2019t mean he could do much. But I agree he could fight with people with kamui but he won\u2019t solo a whole village at that point he wasn\u2019t powerful enough.",

But Kishimoto could've changed how it went, but he couldn't because of the former. So he chose Minato because he was going to die anyways. We can't see this an author's fault from a story point of view but Minato's since it's a manga. Like we can't say this character did a mistake because of the author. I mean yeah but that's a part of his character.\n\nI said TECHNICALLY. He left Kurama behind which he summoned. That also resulted in Minato's death. So yeah thrashed. \n\nThere is no point in fighting the whole village. Just Kamui is yourself behind toddler Naruto and take him with yourself to babysit.\n\nOne would argue he could solo the whole village though I doubt the kid version could. Massacre Uchiha can probably. Although I won't talk about this but you underestimate Kamui. Also, Hashi cells is a part of Obito. You can also say Minato only won because he had FTG. It doesn't work that way. They are characters and those are the things that make them what they are. Btw as an ending note I would like to say just out of context Obito survived a way bigger Rasengan from KCM1 Naruto and came out a scratch.",

            "body": "While I enjoy Boruto for the most part, I think his personality and fighting style should have been closer to Minato\u2019s to differentiate him from Naruto more. Because as it stands, we just got a more privileged, less likeable, slightly more talented Naruto, at least in the beginning of the series. I think that\u2019s a large part of why so many people don\u2019t like the series. I think he\u2019s better now after reconciling with Naruto and the introduction of Kawaki but it still seems like the authors are struggling to give him his own identity unqiue from a young Naruto. Hopefully after the time skip he\u2019ll take on a more serious, Minato-like personality, as that seems to be the direction they\u2019re going.",

Get's his hand slashed by Obito (uncontrolled jin) whereas Tobirama was able to land to major hits to Perfect controlled Jin state. Don't forget that Tobirama was better than KCM2 Minato which means he's leagues above Hokage Minato (feat wise). KCM makes up Minato's nerf and still makes him hellla stronger and faster whereas Tobirama's speed is just nerfed. Minato created Rasengan but we all know a 1000 times better user. Had 2 of his students killed and one got PTSD. Kinda was not able to save Kushina. Could've saved her if he put the other inside her and not him ( she would've survived just like Naruto did), which makes him hella stupid because he is going to die anyways. Fought 14yr old Kid Obito and almost got thrashed (Obito had trained only 1 year prior the fight so let's not talk about any other  version of Obito). Made his son an outcast and the ONLY FUCKING REASON HE HAS IS So ThAt hE CoUlD MaSEtR iT to FiGHt a guy he technically himself couldn't defeat. When you think about it, this is a major plothole. With Minato's logic, Obito would've come back the next week and this time it would be even more easy because this time it's just a kid and a geezer. So Naruto dies. Entrusting something that almost no man(alive) on Earth (including himself) couldn't achieve (which is defeating FUCKING MADARA UCHIHA) and just saying I believe in you only puts the world's pressure on him as if it's his duty. Even Jiraiya didn't want to strain the goal of peace on Naruto. He just wanted to pass it on and wanted him to try as well and he was only certain that Naruto would be able to do so prior his death. Topping Academy Results also don't make him any great , Kakashi was 5 when he became Genin (ik it was war time but still becaus no one else but only he passed and even after that no one was able to catch up for years) Imagine 10 yr old Kakashi almost a jounin sitting for kid's Genin exam. He But it's not like I dislike him, he's cool. Okay, but seriously I don't dislike him for all these points, some are just reasons for not giving him the show. But seriously I don't think any parent would wanna make their child a jin knowing that that beast killed 1000s of civilians and shinobi prior the sealing (even Kushina was opposed to this). The treatment Naruto got is just unbearable to watch although it is Hiruzen's fault as a Hokage but also Minato's because there is just no fucking way the people of the village would forgive a beast who killed their precious loved ones (thanks to Naruto and himself even KURAMA got salvation). Edit: idk what i said wrong but it people are downvoting me, seems like they also like to see Naruto being an outcast.",

He said \"teleportation\" in English Sub/dub and Shunsin no jutsu in the orginal manga and jap voice. Shunsin no jutsu translates to Body Flicker and Hiraishin Translates to FTG. Do your homework, try Googling what Minato used Hiraishin or Shunsin (even try to hear it). Don't disrespect Kishimotos writings. Even if you don't want to believe it which ik most people wouldn't, still you can't disagree on the fact that Tobirama had better feats against Obito. Infact, everything I said is true. Just tell me one thing that's flawed. And also Obito is Obito, Minato is nothing without FTG compared to his FTG self, sharingan is essentially a part of the COPY NINJA and the Uchihas, KURAMA for Naruto, wood for hashi and similarly hashi cells for Obito. It's a part of the character (lol even literally) you take them away he dies and there is no show called Naruto. Your arguments don't make any sense. Your fanboyism has blinded you. You can like the character and I'm not stopping you. It's only you who wanted some reasoning.",

Mind you this was just (yang) Kurama leaking bits of his chakra. Kushina was able to move and talk (Talked to Naruto and Hiruzen) even after Kurama was sealed. Kushina herself has shown capable of restraining Kurama, so even if half of him was sealed, she would've survived. Even if you ignore that, bits would be enough to regenerate the part similarly like Naruto did because Kurama doesn't wanna die.\n\n\n\n\nThrashed Obito, yes but no. Minato had himself that the one who makes their move even a single milli second faster would win. Obito prior the main fight (after Minato dodged the first one) said he would use Kamui even more faster (indicating he will surely suck minato this time). So it wouldn't be correct to say that it was an easy win. \n\n\n\nCould've come back anytime. Easily scales aboves Hiruzen in speed and thus stronger than him. Hiruzen doesn't have any counter Kamui nor does he have the reaction speed to perform one. Even if you ignore this, we know Obito many a time checked the stone tablet using Kamui. Obito was also able to Kamui himself behind Naruto in Five Kage Summit Arc, he does the same and it's done for Naruto. No one to stop him. Kamui is pretty much broken.\nI am really interested to see if you have any counter arguments to that.",

This has nothing to do with Minatos skill or intelligence. It\u2019s just\u2026 how it was written. \n\nWell, you\u2019re the one who said Obito thrashed Minato? I just repeated your words never said it was an easy win. Minato did, factually, one shot Obito who only survived because of Hashirama cells which are OP. AND he figured out Obito la abilities after being attacked once, THATS the real feat here. \n\nKamui broken? Yes. But a whole village of elite ninja would take out ONE guy. Remember he was 13 or so, only reason he did so well the first time was because of the nine tails. The 5 Kage summit is 16 years later when he\u2019s much stronger. \n\nBeing able to kamui to an abandoned secret location out in the forests of the abandoned uchiha clan isnt a feat. He basically just snuck in, doesn\u2019t mean he could do much. But I agree he could fight with people with kamui but he won\u2019t solo a whole village at that point he wasn\u2019t powerful enough.",

But Kishimoto could've changed how it went, but he couldn't because of the former. So he chose Minato because he was going to die anyways. We can't see this an author's fault from a story point of view but Minato's since it's a manga. Like we can't say this character did a mistake because of the author. I mean yeah but that's a part of his character.\n\nI said TECHNICALLY. He left Kurama behind which he summoned. That also resulted in Minato's death. So yeah thrashed. \n\nThere is no point in fighting the whole village. Just Kamui is yourself behind toddler Naruto and take him with yourself to babysit.\n\nOne would argue he could solo the whole village though I doubt the kid version could. Massacre Uchiha can probably. Although I won't talk about this but you underestimate Kamui. Also, Hashi cells is a part of Obito. You can also say Minato only won because he had FTG. It doesn't work that way. They are characters and those are the things that make them what they are.

Had 2 of his students killed and one got PTSD. Kinda was not able to save Kushina. Could've saved her if he put the other inside her and not him ( she would've survived just like Naruto did), which makes him hella stupid because he is going to die anyways. Fought 14yr old Kid Obito and almost got thrashed (Obito had trained only 1 year prior the fight so let's not talk about any other  version of Obito). Made his son an outcast and the ONLY FUCKING REASON HE HAS IS So ThAt hE CoUlD MaSEtR iT to FiGHt a guy he technically himself couldn't defeat. When you think about it, this is a major plothole. With Minato's logic, Obito would've come back the next week and this time it would be even more easy because this time it's just a kid and a geezer. So Naruto dies. Entrusting something that almost no man(alive) on Earth (including himself) couldn't achieve (which is defeating FUCKING MADARA UCHIHA) and just saying I believe in you only puts the world's pressure on him as if it's his duty. Even Jiraiya didn't want to strain the goal of peace on Naruto. He just wanted to pass it on and wanted him to try as well and he was only certain that Naruto would be able to do so prior his death. Topping Academy Results also don't make him any great , Kakashi was 5 when he became Genin (ik it was war time but still becaus no one else but only he passed and even after that no one was able to catch up for years) Imagine 10 yr old Kakashi almost a jounin sitting for kid's Genin exam. He But it's not like I dislike him, he's cool. Okay, but seriously I don't dislike him for all these points, some are just reasons for not giving him the show. But seriously I don't think any parent would wanna make their child a jin knowing that that beast killed 1000s of civilians and shinobi prior the sealing (even Kushina was opposed to this). The treatment Naruto got is just unbearable to watch although it is Hiruzen's fault as a Hokage but also Minato's because there is just no fucking way the people of the village would forgive a beast who killed their precious loved ones (thanks to Naruto and himself even KURAMA got salvation). Edit: idk what i said wrong but it people are downvoting me, seems like they also like to see Naruto being an outcast.",

Tobirama himself mentioned that Minato has perfected Flying Raijin to an extent even he couldnt master . Also , Obito at that time was almost at Kage level cause he had Hashirama cells along with Sharingan still Minato managed to make him retreat in 2 minutes . You can hate Minato if you want to cause thats your opinion and no one has a right to question it but please stop making nonsensical comments just because you hate him .",

He said \"teleportation\" in English Sub/dub and Shunsin no jutsu in the orginal manga and jap voice. Shunsin no jutsu translates to Body Flicker and Hiraishin Translates to FTG. Do your homework, try Googling what Minato used Hiraishin or Shunsin (even try to hear it). Don't disrespect Kishimotos writings. Even if you don't want to believe it which ik most people wouldn't, still you can't disagree on the fact that Tobirama had better feats against Obito. Infact, everything I said is true. Just tell me one thing that's flawed. And also Obito is Obito, Minato is nothing without FTG compared to his FTG self, sharingan is essentially a part of the COPY NINJA and the Uchihas, KURAMA for Naruto, wood for hashi and similarly hashi cells for Obito. It's a part of the character (lol even literally) you take them away he dies and there is no show called Naruto. Your arguments don't make any sense. Your fanboyism has blinded you. You can like the character and I'm not stopping you. It's only you who wanted some reasoning.",

Even if you ignore that, bits would be enough to regenerate the part similarly like Naruto did because Kurama doesn't wanna die.\n\n\n\n\nThrashed Obito, yes but no. Minato had himself that the one who makes their move even a single milli second faster would win.

Hiruzen doesn't have any counter Kamui nor does he have the reaction speed to perform one. Even if you ignore this, we know Obito many a time checked the stone tablet using Kamui.

It\u2019s just\u2026 how it was written. \n\nWell, you\u2019re the one who said Obito thrashed Minato? I just repeated your words never said it was an easy win. Minato did, factually, one shot Obito who only survived because of Hashirama cells which are OP. AND he figured out Obito la abilities after being attacked once, THATS the real feat here. \n\nKamui broken? Yes. But a whole village of elite ninja would take out ONE guy. Remember he was 13 or so, only reason he did so well the first time was because of the nine tails. The 5 Kage summit is 16 years later when he\u2019s much stronger. \n\nBeing able to kamui to an abandoned secret location out in the forests of the abandoned uchiha clan isnt a feat. He basically just snuck in, doesn\u2019t mean he could do much. But I agree he could fight with people with kamui but he won\u2019t solo a whole village at that point he wasn\u2019t powerful enough.",

But Kishimoto could've changed how it went, but he couldn't because of the former. So he chose Minato because he was going to die anyways. We can't see this an author's fault from a story point of view but Minato's since it's a manga. Like we can't say this character did a mistake because of the author. I mean yeah but that's a part of his character.\n\nI said TECHNICALLY. He left Kurama behind which he summoned. That also resulted in Minato's death. So yeah thrashed. \n\nThere is no point in fighting the whole village. Just Kamui is yourself behind toddler Naruto and take him with yourself to babysit.\n\nOne would argue he could solo the whole village though I doubt the kid version could. Massacre Uchiha can probably. Although I won't talk about this but you underestimate Kamui. Also, Hashi cells is a part of Obito. You can also say Minato only won because he had FTG. It doesn't work that way. They are characters and those are the things that make them what they are. Btw as an ending note I would like to say just out of context Obito survived a way bigger Rasengan from KCM1 Naruto and came out a scratch.",

Do your homework, try Googling what Minato used Hiraishin or Shunsin (even try to hear it). Don't disrespect Kishimotos writings. Even if you don't want to believe it which ik most people wouldn't, still you can't disagree on the fact that Tobirama had better feats against Obito. Infact, everything I said is true. Just tell me one thing that's flawed. And also Obito is Obito, Minato is nothing without FTG compared to his FTG self, sharingan is essentially a part of the COPY NINJA and the Uchihas, KURAMA for Naruto, wood for hashi and similarly hashi cells for Obito. It's a part of the character (lol even literally) you take them away he dies and there is no show called Naruto. Your arguments don't make any sense. Your fanboyism has blinded you.

Mind you this was just (yang) Kurama leaking bits of his chakra. Kushina was able to move and talk (Talked to Naruto and Hiruzen) even after Kurama was sealed. Kushina herself has shown capable of restraining Kurama, so even if half of him was sealed, she would've survived. Even if you ignore that, bits would be enough to regenerate the part similarly like Naruto did because Kurama doesn't wanna die.\n\n\n\n\nThrashed Obito, yes but no. Minato had himself that the one who makes their move even a single milli second faster would win. Obito prior the main fight (after Minato dodged the first one) said he would use Kamui even more faster (indicating he will surely suck minato this time). So it wouldn't be correct to say that it was an easy win. \n\n\n\nCould've come back anytime. Easily scales aboves Hiruzen in speed and thus stronger than him. Hiruzen doesn't have any counter Kamui nor does he have the reaction speed to perform one. Even if you ignore this, we know Obito many a time checked the stone tablet using Kamui. Obito was also able to Kamui himself behind Naruto in Five Kage Summit Arc, he does the same and it's done for Naruto. No one to stop him. Kamui is pretty much broken.\nI am really interested to see if you have any counter arguments to that.",

Minato did, factually, one shot Obito who only survived because of Hashirama cells which are OP. AND he figured out Obito la abilities after being attacked once, THATS the real feat here. \n\nKamui broken? Yes. But a whole village of elite ninja would take out ONE guy. Remember he was 13 or so, only reason he did so well the first time was because of the nine tails. The 5 Kage summit is 16 years later when he\u2019s much stronger. \n\nBeing able to kamui to an abandoned secret location out in the forests of the abandoned uchiha clan isnt a feat. He basically just snuck in, doesn\u2019t mean he could do much. But I agree he could fight with people with kamui but he won\u2019t solo a whole village at that point he wasn\u2019t powerful enough.",

But Kishimoto could've changed how it went, but he couldn't because of the former. So he chose Minato because he was going to die anyways. We can't see this an author's fault from a story point of view but Minato's since it's a manga. Like we can't say this character did a mistake because of the author. I mean yeah but that's a part of his character.\n\nI said TECHNICALLY. He left Kurama behind which he summoned. That also resulted in Minato's death. So yeah thrashed. \n\nThere is no point in fighting the whole village. Just Kamui is yourself behind toddler Naruto and take him with yourself to babysit.\n\nOne would argue he could solo the whole village though I doubt the kid version could. Massacre Uchiha can probably. Although I won't talk about this but you underestimate Kamui. Also, Hashi cells is a part of Obito. You can also say Minato only won because he had FTG. It doesn't work that way. They are characters and those are the things that make them what they are. Btw as an ending note I would like to say just out of context Obito survived a way bigger Rasengan from KCM1 Naruto and came out a scratch.",

He said \"teleportation\" in English Sub/dub and Shunsin no jutsu in the orginal manga and jap voice. Shunsin no jutsu translates to Body Flicker and Hiraishin Translates to FTG. Do your homework, try Googling what Minato used Hiraishin or Shunsin (even try to hear it). Don't disrespect Kishimotos writings. Even if you don't want to believe it which ik most people wouldn't, still you can't disagree on the fact that Tobirama had better feats against Obito. Infact, everything I said is true. Just tell me one thing that's flawed. And also Obito is Obito, Minato is nothing without FTG compared to his FTG self, sharingan is essentially a part of the COPY NINJA and the Uchihas, KURAMA for Naruto, wood for hashi and similarly hashi cells for Obito. It's a part of the character (lol even literally) you take them away he dies and there is no show called Naruto. Your arguments don't make any sense. Your fanboyism has blinded you. You can like the character and I'm not stopping you. It's only you who wanted some reasoning.",

            "body": "Could've. I agree both were impaled (was still too late to the reaper seal). Naruto was able to heal a hole, no a hole in shoulder by Sasuke's chidori. Mind you this was just (yang) Kurama leaking bits of his chakra. Kushina was able to move and talk (Talked to Naruto and Hiruzen) even after Kurama was sealed. Kushina herself has shown capable of restraining Kurama, so even if half of him was sealed, she would've survived. Even if you ignore that, bits would be enough to regenerate the part similarly like Naruto did because Kurama doesn't wanna die.\n\n\n\n\nThrashed Obito, yes but no. Minato had himself that the one who makes their move even a single milli second faster would win. Obito prior the main fight (after Minato dodged the first one) said he would use Kamui even more faster (indicating he will surely suck minato this time). So it wouldn't be correct to say that it was an easy win. \n\n\n\nCould've come back anytime. Easily scales aboves Hiruzen in speed and thus stronger than him. Hiruzen doesn't have any counter Kamui nor does he have the reaction speed to perform one. Even if you ignore this, we know Obito many a time checked the stone tablet using Kamui. Obito was also able to Kamui himself behind Naruto in Five Kage Summit Arc, he does the same and it's done for Naruto. No one to stop him. Kamui is pretty much broken.\nI am really interested to see if you have any counter arguments to that.",

It\u2019s just\u2026 how it was written. \n\nWell, you\u2019re the one who said Obito thrashed Minato? I just repeated your words never said it was an easy win. Minato did, factually, one shot Obito who only survived because of Hashirama cells which are OP. AND he figured out Obito la abilities after being attacked once, THATS the real feat here. \n\nKamui broken? Yes. But a whole village of elite ninja would take out ONE guy. Remember he was 13 or so, only reason he did so well the first time was because of the nine tails. The 5 Kage summit is 16 years later when he\u2019s much stronger. \n\nBeing able to kamui to an abandoned secret location out in the forests of the abandoned uchiha clan isnt a feat. He basically just snuck in, doesn\u2019t mean he could do much. But I agree he could fight with people with kamui but he won\u2019t solo a whole village at that point he wasn\u2019t powerful enough.",

But Kishimoto could've changed how it went, but he couldn't because of the former. So he chose Minato because he was going to die anyways. We can't see this an author's fault from a story point of view but Minato's since it's a manga. Like we can't say this character did a mistake because of the author. I mean yeah but that's a part of his character.\n\nI said TECHNICALLY. He left Kurama behind which he summoned. That also resulted in Minato's death. So yeah thrashed. \n\nThere is no point in fighting the whole village. Just Kamui is yourself behind toddler Naruto and take him with yourself to babysit.\n\nOne would argue he could solo the whole village though I doubt the kid version could. Massacre Uchiha can probably. Although I won't talk about this but you underestimate Kamui. Also, Hashi cells is a part of Obito. You can also say Minato only won because he had FTG. It doesn't work that way. They are characters and those are the things that make them what they are. Btw as an ending note I would like to say just out of context Obito survived a way bigger Rasengan from KCM1 Naruto and came out a scratch.",

It\u2019s just\u2026 how it was written. \n\nWell, you\u2019re the one who said Obito thrashed Minato? I just repeated your words never said it was an easy win. Minato did, factually, one shot Obito who only survived because of Hashirama cells which are OP. AND he figured out Obito la abilities after being attacked once, THATS the real feat here. \n\nKamui broken? Yes. But a whole village of elite ninja would take out ONE guy. Remember he was 13 or so, only reason he did so well the first time was because of the nine tails. The 5 Kage summit is 16 years later when he\u2019s much stronger. \n\nBeing able to kamui to an abandoned secret location out in the forests of the abandoned uchiha clan isnt a feat. He basically just snuck in, doesn\u2019t mean he could do much. But I agree he could fight with people with kamui but he won\u2019t solo a whole village at that point he wasn\u2019t powerful enough.",
