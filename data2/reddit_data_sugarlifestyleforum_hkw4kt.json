    "body": "I am new to the sugar bowl. I joined Secret Benefits and managed to to find a SD that I get along with well.   When we texted he never asked for nudes or personal information. We talked about our interest, sex and sent selfies. We met this week three times. First encounter was a meeting where we set up arrangements and allowances. It was awkward because we sitting by Whole Foods and he was like \u201cSo let\u2019s talk about allowances\u201d and I\u2019m sure people heard. I\u2019m 18 and he\u2019s way older. It went really well and he wasn\u2019t creepy at all. Then the next two meetings were intimate. Now he texts me everyday and we\u2019ve been happy ever since. I\u2019m planning on seeing him two times a week.",

For a first date where most girls want some discretion about being out in public with an older man it works really good.  Plus they have a kick ass menu.",
