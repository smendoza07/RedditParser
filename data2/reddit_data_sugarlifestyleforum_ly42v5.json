    "body": "\nThere was a recent post about a woman who shared her honest and hard experiences as a SB. It nauseates me that a lot of the men in the comments were detracting the point of the post about how SDs also face dangers in the bowl.\n\nYes but NO. Women are much more likely to be subjected to rape via sex without pay or sex without consent. Women also have to stay safe when it comes to the power imbalances of age, wealth, connections, fame, etc. Worrying about this is a legitimate concern because this can negatively affect someone for the rest of their life. \n\nOn the subject of rape in the context of sugaring.... Sure you can report rape to the police but rape without pay does not provide protections to victims under the law and rape prosecutions are rarely ever taken seriously under the law. SBs have to deal with not only the potential trauma of being taking advantage of but the trauma of not being legally protected.\n\nDo you know how I KNOW this is a common phenomenon for SBs? How often do you see posts about SBs being sexually violated or being shorted after sex? It\u2019s a NORMAL and DAILY phenomenon on this sub.\n\nWhat are the common dangers that SDs face? Being surprise attacked by a pimp or a SB? Maybe, but how many of those posts do we see? Once a blue moon. The dangers that SDs seem to complain about out on this sub is being scammed out of money and extortion. \n\nAlthough extortion can be reputation- damaging, there are heavy legal protections. And even being scammed out of money is still a recoverable scenario. Men lose money all the fucking time on Wall Street or crypto, so don\u2019t worry about being scammed by a hot 20 year old when you\u2019re thinking with your pp.\n\nLet\u2019s not pretend the dangers women face sugaring are even remotely comparable to the dangers men face. Because when we do, it downplays the emotional, sexual, physical violence SBs are faced with on a real basis in the bowl.",

Men in comments said \"they can't fathom a 55 doing so\" therefore this must not be true \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I've done sugaring and this doesn't surprise me at all, men look to take advantage of young and vulnerable all the time.

I'm not.\n\nAlso, we should acknowledge that risks of violence (rape is violence) are not unique to the sugar lifestyle.\n\nIt's very important for SBs to follow some basic rules for safety. I know this does not always protect you... I wish it did... I'm wholly empathetic to what women go through in general. \n\n1. Someone should always know where you are.\n\n2. Get your money up front\n\n3. Establish intimacy rules up front\n\n4. Do not let money influence you to ignore red flags. An overly sexual M&G, texts, comments, etc are huge red flags. Respect is a key feature of any SR.\n\n5. Do not negotiate your worth. The number one way to tell if an SD respects you is found here. Even an attempt at negotiating should say everything you need to know. Either they can't afford to have an SB or they are trying to get a cheaper escort. I'm sorry guys... but those are FACTS.\n\nI feel like I'm an ideal SD. If I wanted a hooker,  I would call a hooker. I want a DATING RELATIONSHIP. If your POT SD is not looking for that... move on. DO NOT COMPROMISE FOR NEED OF MONEY.\n\nHere is how I conduct myself...\n\nI never ask for nudes before our SR informs me that it's ok. If we've been intimate and you show me nudes, I'm going to ask if I want the photo/video I was shown. Every SB that has given me nudes showed them to me without asking. If they didn't show me... I didn't ask.\n\nI don't talk about anything sexual before a M&G. I don't even talk about money. Let's meet first in a public place so that we each feel safe and have only one goal in mind... are we compatible? We can discuss money and sex in person.\n\nIf you are too shy to express your wants/needs then you should not be in the bowl at all. You will get taken advantage of because you aren't expressing yourself or you are negotiating with red flags out of pure shyness and conflict avoidance. The bowl is not for you, baby. \n\nYou have to be able to maintain your rules in all situations. Do not ignore any red flags.\n\nDoes that solve every potential issue? No... The bowl has risks. Vanilla dating has risks. Hell... going to the store has risks. You can only do what you can do. I wish this risk didn't exist for women... I really do. You all are amazing in your capacity to overcome fear and step out of your comfort zone.",

Your position seems to be that if a SB gets scammed it\u2019s \u201crape\u201d but if a SD gets scammed it\u2019s no big deal because SDs \u201close money all the time on Wall Street\u201d?  You\u2019ve got a screwed up moral compass.  You also think that the damage to reputation goes only one way?  That flies in the face reality where men lose marriages and custody battles because they weren\u2019t smart.  I can tell you stories about how a former SB of mine moved in with a guy and then filed over a dozen lawsuits against him based on BS theories like \u201crape for not paying\u201d.  They all got tossed out of Court but it cost him thousands to get rid of her.  She then tried to sue the cops and the judge.  His reputation was trashed.  She got committed to a psyche ward.  Bad shit happens.  I\u2019ll be blunt, if you can\u2019t abide the risk, do something else.  No one is forcing you to have sex for money.",

First, you mischaracterize my position.  I think giving a SB the stiff Richard and then stiffing them is wrong.  That guy is a thief.  So is the SB that hints at having sex then bails as soon as she gets paid.  As I stated, it\u2019s called \u201ctheft of services\u201d or \u201cbreach of contract\u201d. It can be a crime but in most instances it\u2019s a civil matter.  You have to sue to get your money.  The problem is that in the eyes of the law, the SB and the SD are engaging in an illegal activity (prostitution) and they won\u2019t recognize it as a crime or a valid civil action.  I don\u2019t make those rules.  It\u2019s the law.  It\u2019s also completely in control of the SB or SD.  If you don\u2019t want to get scammed don\u2019t suck the guy\u2019s dick until he pays you. Pretty simple, really.  The more important thing is to make sure you are safe from physical harm.  That\u2019s where I do think a SB is at a disadvantage and needs to take precautions.  Same with the chance of pregnancy.  That is lopsided for obvious reasons.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear that you are closed minded and want to blame \u201cmen\u201d.  It\u2019s a two-way street.",

SBs are *also* lied to, stolen from, taken advantage of, doxxed, threatened, blackmailed regarding photos etc., *and* we have to constantly and vigilantly be aware of the fact that literally *any* seemingly kind and genuine SD could force themselves on us, assault us in numerous ways etc. \n\nThis is why the SD should offer the PPM before clothes come off (even if it\u2019s just slipping it into her purse or lying it on the table), every time, regardless of what they\u2019ve experienced in the past. Having a SB take the money and run, while horrible and unacceptable, will simply *never* be as traumatic and devastating as having a SD partake in intimacy and bolt, leaving you naked and confused, without any monetary compensation or answers.\n\nNobody deserves to be used, abused or lied to, and this applies to all participating parties, man or woman or non-binary, SD or SB or whomever else. I just cannot stand seeing SDs in this sub make outrageous claims regarding their risk being as high or higher than that of a SB.

Almost every SD I\u2019ve ever moved past the M&G with has extended all of these *basic decencies* to me, along with genuine concern, compassion and care. However, the few terrible experiences I\u2019ve had were far more than enough to make me set irrevocable and unconditional rules in place, for myself. Any POT that takes issue with these rules can kick fucking rocks. No amount of money or companionship is worth my physical safety and mental health. \n\nAfter going to a hotel following a three-hour first dinner date with a POT, being intimate for *hours,* and watching him \u201cexcuse himself to the bathroom,\u201d only to grab the cash he\u2019d set on the dresser and bolt out the door, sending me a text five minutes later saying, \u201cthanks for the hot fun, feel free to stay in the room tonight,\u201d I\u2019ll *never* partake in intimacy without receiving the PPM first until a SR is well beyond established. \n\nAfter going to a POT\u2019s rental on the *third* date for our first intimate encounter, having a couple of glasses of wine, consenting to light touching and kissing but *not* consenting to sex and loudly saying, \u201cno,\u201d as he forced himself inside of me, continuing until he finished and then leaving me sobbing and naked while he dressed and left, I\u2019ll *never* ignore my gut feeling, again, nor will I *ever* consume alcohol on a sugar date. I felt uncomfortable with him, upon entering the room, and chose to have a few drinks to \u201cloosen up.\u201d Biggest mistake I ever made in the bowl. \n\nAfter agreeing to an allowance from the start with a new SD (he gave me a generous cash gift at the M&G, effectively earning my trust), only to have five intimate dates with him over the course of a month and then get ghosted, never receiving an allowance or a goodbye, I\u2019ll *never* accept an allowance over PPM before the SR is well established, again. PPM doesn\u2019t only protect SDs, y\u2019all! Get it and get it in *cash,* before clothes come off, until you truly and entirely trust each other! \n\nAll of this happened to me early on in my sugaring experience. I was a young, naive little thing. I\u2019ve always made a conscious effort to see the best in people and am both honest and optimistic to a fault. I learned several extremely harsh lessons in the most difficult of ways. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m able to use my experience to help new SBs, now. There\u2019s gotta be a silver lining!

Completely disassociating and being unable to work or connect with your spouse for days after a random flash of memory comes up because an actor on tv laughed like him, or someone mentioned a person with his name though it's years after you're no longer in the bowl. Having trouble sleeping in a bed with someone after because he attacked you when you were sleeping and disoriented. You had let your guard down and decided to trust him and after you let your guard down he hurt you. Wondering if there was anything you could have done and recalculating it over and over like a rubik's cube puzzle to determine if you could have prevented it. Having to realize that the SD could be out there hurting other women and if you go the legal route your name will be dragged in the mud and you will have legal bills like the women you've known who tried to report their attackers. So I don't pity the man. If a psycho SB blows up his life by outing their relationship, that's fucked up, but he CHOSE to go outside his marriage knowing it could blow up accidentally even. She did not CHOOSE to be in a relationship that got her raped.",

A woman would have to be completely bonkers or have a really good reason to do that. Most people would never - because that involves literally physically traumatising yourself for your outcome - and human nature is such that we generally don't want to assault ourselves lmao. \n\nPerfectly \"sane\", otherwise \"reasonable\" men rape/sexually assault women regularly. Due to cultural factors, many men - especially men in positions of power - simply do not consider what they are doing as wrong or rape, or don't care. They just view it as taking what they want (self centred), and they don't consider/care the consequences on the other person. It's not vengeance or psychosis, it's sheer inconsideration. Raping someone does not involve physically harming yourself, so it is MUCH easier to do, and is therefore MUCH more common. The statistics and science bears this out. This is even MORE true in SW or sugaring relationships where the power dynamics and dehumanisation is even stronger. Many more people (so not just men) are people who commit/have committed sexual assault/rape than are people who would bash their own face up for vengeance. \n\nI'm just not sure why you want to derail a post about SBs being raped/abused to talk about \"bad things happen to men too\". Most of us know that. It's just no where near as common. \n\nAnd even then, when it were to happen (rarely), there is still something viscerally more traumatic (you can look into the science behind trauma for evidence of this) about having your body violated than being blackmailed or losing your job/family is. You can lose everything material... and still feel SAFE on a fundamental, physical level. This is not true for rape. \n\nA person can live their life, never feeling safe in their own body ever again due to rape/sexual assault. The same cannot be said for any of the things listed that happen to SDs. You can't escape the impact of sexual assault/rape. It lives with you, in your nervous system, (read The Body Keeps Score for the science behind this). No amount of material wealth will fix that. You can't move away, find a new wife, make more money, make friends etc to move past it and mitigate the impacts. None of that will actually help. \n \nYou are trapped, in a body that is haunting you with the memories of abuse, forever. You learn to cope... but you will never be the same, because nothing you lost was material. What you lost was your body being a safe space, and your own. For some, you will wake up screaming in the middle of the night because you're having a somatic flashback (experiencing the physical sensation over again) and it won't stop hurting. Even the criminal justice system can't take that way, or recompense you for that. \n\nI genuinely think half this issue is that many men can't even begin to understand/empathise with what it would be like to have their body violated like that, so they try to make comparisons to things they can imagine happening - but it just isn't the same. \n\nAnd the fact you do that - not to better empathise with people? But to derail the conversation and go \"oh woe is me, someone could hurt me in this entirely different way too!!! stop complaining about rape!!!\" (because let's be clear, that is the subtext here in the context of this post) is a huge red flag about your inability to empathise with other people and instead make things about you. \n\nAn inability to consider/empathise with other people and instead return focus back to you, your outcomes and what you want/might be hurt by? Is the first slippery step down the pathway of ending up the men I spoke about earlier. The supposedly \"sane\" ones, who just don't realise or don't care about the consequences of their actions on others because they are too wrapped up in their own minds. It's where people who commit sexual assault/rape start out. \n\nConsider this your warning. You've started down the path. You might've already reached the finish line. It's not too late to turn back and become better person who doesn't think solely in terms of themselves. \n\nBut what are the chances you'll change? With a mindset like yours?",

Given he didn\u2019t actually rape her, of course. Sex with a young - 18 and over- or older SB is not against the law and men do not get judged for it, but often patted on the back and high fived for it. Again, a woman is judged much more harshly over sex work. The argument  men have it just as bad, in regards to safety and emotional well-being is ridiculous. The physical, psychological and emotional scars a woman must live with the rest of her life can ruin quality of life and cause additional health issues . Also, women are much more likely to catch a sexually transmitted disease from a man vs. a woman passing on one to him. There are many more to list but if you have to explain it to a man, then it is wasted breath, anyway. A man with any decent character already knows and understands the risks are greater to women.",

If a woman agrees to have sex with a man after she asks him if he has any STDs and he says no, and then it turns out he actually has an STD, he has perpetrated a fraud in order to obtain sex.

I'm actually a lawyer. \n\nWhile you're correct that rape has a legal definition, you omitted the fact that the definition in some jurisdictions allows for claims of rape by fraud or rape by deception. The idea being that if the rape statute mentions that rape is sex without consent, that consent isn't actually meaningful consent if there was fraud or deception present. Just like you can't enforce a contract signed under fraudulent or materially deceptive conditions. \n\nIt's definitely a more modern view of rape. Old statutes focus on force rather than consent. But those statues are being change because the law is recognizing that the majority of rapes are not the stranger jumping out of a bush to hold a knife to your throat. The majority of rapes are a lot less black and white, but victims still need protection. \n\nAlso arguing with OP about what rape is legally defined as when you don't even know what country she's in is dumb. There's a HUGE range of law across the world, and there's a huge range of laws even between the states.",

California probably has the most liberal statute and even that has never been applied to a case where one person agreed to have sex for money and didn't get paid. Those cases are almost strictly applied in two areas.  The first is an act of impersonation where it's a dark room and the other person believes she is having sex with her boyfriend/husband when it's someone else.  The other instance involves a professional, such as a doctor or nurse who sexually assaults someone under the guise of medical treatment.  Think Dr. Nasser and the US Olympic Gymnastics/Swimming programs.  \n\nIf all the guy did was agree to pay and then renege after the deed is done, that is technically theft of services or breach of contract.  Since prostitution is illegal in almost every county in the US and the SB is unlikely to be a licensed prostitute working in a licensed brothel in bumfuck, NV it's not actionable.  \n\nObviously, is actionable if the elements of forcible rape are present. etc.  I'm talking strictly about failing to complete the commercial transaction, here.\n\nI'm restricting my comments to the USA.  \n\nIf you can cite any US cases that say otherwise, I'm all eyes.",

I'm not.\n\nAlso, we should acknowledge that risks of violence (rape is violence) are not unique to the sugar lifestyle.\n\nIt's very important for SBs to follow some basic rules for safety. I know this does not always protect you... I wish it did... I'm wholly empathetic to what women go through in general. \n\n1. Someone should always know where you are.\n\n2. Get your money up front\n\n3. Establish intimacy rules up front\n\n4. Do not let money influence you to ignore red flags. An overly sexual M&G, texts, comments, etc are huge red flags. Respect is a key feature of any SR.\n\n5. Do not negotiate your worth. The number one way to tell if an SD respects you is found here. Even an attempt at negotiating should say everything you need to know. Either they can't afford to have an SB or they are trying to get a cheaper escort. I'm sorry guys... but those are FACTS.\n\nI feel like I'm an ideal SD. If I wanted a hooker,  I would call a hooker. I want a DATING RELATIONSHIP. If your POT SD is not looking for that... move on. DO NOT COMPROMISE FOR NEED OF MONEY.\n\nHere is how I conduct myself...\n\nI never ask for nudes before our SR informs me that it's ok. If we've been intimate and you show me nudes, I'm going to ask if I want the photo/video I was shown. Every SB that has given me nudes showed them to me without asking. If they didn't show me... I didn't ask.\n\nI don't talk about anything sexual before a M&G. I don't even talk about money. Let's meet first in a public place so that we each feel safe and have only one goal in mind... are we compatible? We can discuss money and sex in person.\n\nIf you are too shy to express your wants/needs then you should not be in the bowl at all. You will get taken advantage of because you aren't expressing yourself or you are negotiating with red flags out of pure shyness and conflict avoidance. The bowl is not for you, baby. \n\nYou have to be able to maintain your rules in all situations. Do not ignore any red flags.\n\nDoes that solve every potential issue? No... The bowl has risks. Vanilla dating has risks. Hell... going to the store has risks. You can only do what you can do. I wish this risk didn't exist for women... I really do. You all are amazing in your capacity to overcome fear and step out of your comfort zone.",

First, you mischaracterize my position.  I think giving a SB the stiff Richard and then stiffing them is wrong.  That guy is a thief.  So is the SB that hints at having sex then bails as soon as she gets paid.  As I stated, it\u2019s called \u201ctheft of services\u201d or \u201cbreach of contract\u201d. It can be a crime but in most instances it\u2019s a civil matter.  You have to sue to get your money.  The problem is that in the eyes of the law, the SB and the SD are engaging in an illegal activity (prostitution) and they won\u2019t recognize it as a crime or a valid civil action.  I don\u2019t make those rules.  It\u2019s the law.  It\u2019s also completely in control of the SB or SD.  If you don\u2019t want to get scammed don\u2019t suck the guy\u2019s dick until he pays you. Pretty simple, really.  The more important thing is to make sure you are safe from physical harm.  That\u2019s where I do think a SB is at a disadvantage and needs to take precautions.  Same with the chance of pregnancy.  That is lopsided for obvious reasons.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear that you are closed minded and want to blame \u201cmen\u201d.  It\u2019s a two-way street.",

                    "body": "Thanks for this input! Almost every SD I\u2019ve ever moved past the M&G with has extended all of these *basic decencies* to me, along with genuine concern, compassion and care. However, the few terrible experiences I\u2019ve had were far more than enough to make me set irrevocable and unconditional rules in place, for myself. Any POT that takes issue with these rules can kick fucking rocks. No amount of money or companionship is worth my physical safety and mental health. \n\nAfter going to a hotel following a three-hour first dinner date with a POT, being intimate for *hours,* and watching him \u201cexcuse himself to the bathroom,\u201d only to grab the cash he\u2019d set on the dresser and bolt out the door, sending me a text five minutes later saying, \u201cthanks for the hot fun, feel free to stay in the room tonight,\u201d I\u2019ll *never* partake in intimacy without receiving the PPM first until a SR is well beyond established. \n\nAfter going to a POT\u2019s rental on the *third* date for our first intimate encounter, having a couple of glasses of wine, consenting to light touching and kissing but *not* consenting to sex and loudly saying, \u201cno,\u201d as he forced himself inside of me, continuing until he finished and then leaving me sobbing and naked while he dressed and left, I\u2019ll *never* ignore my gut feeling, again, nor will I *ever* consume alcohol on a sugar date. I felt uncomfortable with him, upon entering the room, and chose to have a few drinks to \u201cloosen up.\u201d Biggest mistake I ever made in the bowl. \n\nAfter agreeing to an allowance from the start with a new SD (he gave me a generous cash gift at the M&G, effectively earning my trust), only to have five intimate dates with him over the course of a month and then get ghosted, never receiving an allowance or a goodbye, I\u2019ll *never* accept an allowance over PPM before the SR is well established, again. PPM doesn\u2019t only protect SDs, y\u2019all! Get it and get it in *cash,* before clothes come off, until you truly and entirely trust each other! \n\nAll of this happened to me early on in my sugaring experience. I was a young, naive little thing. I\u2019ve always made a conscious effort to see the best in people and am both honest and optimistic to a fault. I learned several extremely harsh lessons in the most difficult of ways. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m able to use my experience to help new SBs, now. There\u2019s gotta be a silver lining! That\u2019s mine.",

Completely disassociating and being unable to work or connect with your spouse for days after a random flash of memory comes up because an actor on tv laughed like him, or someone mentioned a person with his name though it's years after you're no longer in the bowl. Having trouble sleeping in a bed with someone after because he attacked you when you were sleeping and disoriented. You had let your guard down and decided to trust him and after you let your guard down he hurt you. Wondering if there was anything you could have done and recalculating it over and over like a rubik's cube puzzle to determine if you could have prevented it. Having to realize that the SD could be out there hurting other women and if you go the legal route your name will be dragged in the mud and you will have legal bills like the women you've known who tried to report their attackers. So I don't pity the man. If a psycho SB blows up his life by outing their relationship, that's fucked up, but he CHOSE to go outside his marriage knowing it could blow up accidentally even. She did not CHOOSE to be in a relationship that got her raped.",

A woman would have to be completely bonkers or have a really good reason to do that. Most people would never - because that involves literally physically traumatising yourself for your outcome - and human nature is such that we generally don't want to assault ourselves lmao. \n\nPerfectly \"sane\", otherwise \"reasonable\" men rape/sexually assault women regularly. Due to cultural factors, many men - especially men in positions of power - simply do not consider what they are doing as wrong or rape, or don't care. They just view it as taking what they want (self centred), and they don't consider/care the consequences on the other person. It's not vengeance or psychosis, it's sheer inconsideration. Raping someone does not involve physically harming yourself, so it is MUCH easier to do, and is therefore MUCH more common. The statistics and science bears this out. This is even MORE true in SW or sugaring relationships where the power dynamics and dehumanisation is even stronger. Many more people (so not just men) are people who commit/have committed sexual assault/rape than are people who would bash their own face up for vengeance. \n\nI'm just not sure why you want to derail a post about SBs being raped/abused to talk about \"bad things happen to men too\". Most of us know that. It's just no where near as common. \n\nAnd even then, when it were to happen (rarely), there is still something viscerally more traumatic (you can look into the science behind trauma for evidence of this) about having your body violated than being blackmailed or losing your job/family is. You can lose everything material... and still feel SAFE on a fundamental, physical level. This is not true for rape. \n\nA person can live their life, never feeling safe in their own body ever again due to rape/sexual assault. The same cannot be said for any of the things listed that happen to SDs. You can't escape the impact of sexual assault/rape. It lives with you, in your nervous system, (read The Body Keeps Score for the science behind this). No amount of material wealth will fix that. You can't move away, find a new wife, make more money, make friends etc to move past it and mitigate the impacts. None of that will actually help. \n \nYou are trapped, in a body that is haunting you with the memories of abuse, forever. You learn to cope... but you will never be the same, because nothing you lost was material. What you lost was your body being a safe space, and your own. For some, you will wake up screaming in the middle of the night because you're having a somatic flashback (experiencing the physical sensation over again) and it won't stop hurting. Even the criminal justice system can't take that way, or recompense you for that. \n\nI genuinely think half this issue is that many men can't even begin to understand/empathise with what it would be like to have their body violated like that, so they try to make comparisons to things they can imagine happening - but it just isn't the same. \n\nAnd the fact you do that - not to better empathise with people? But to derail the conversation and go \"oh woe is me, someone could hurt me in this entirely different way too!!! stop complaining about rape!!!\" (because let's be clear, that is the subtext here in the context of this post) is a huge red flag about your inability to empathise with other people and instead make things about you. \n\nAn inability to consider/empathise with other people and instead return focus back to you, your outcomes and what you want/might be hurt by? Is the first slippery step down the pathway of ending up the men I spoke about earlier. The supposedly \"sane\" ones, who just don't realise or don't care about the consequences of their actions on others because they are too wrapped up in their own minds. It's where people who commit sexual assault/rape start out. \n\nConsider this your warning. You've started down the path. You might've already reached the finish line. It's not too late to turn back and become better person who doesn't think solely in terms of themselves. \n\nBut what are the chances you'll change? With a mindset like yours?",

Even in scenario, for example, when she agreed for some basic intimacy but you suddenly decided to go with hard bdsm and forgot to ask her about it... Still a rapist....\n\nin the rest cases you are technically not.. But it's not less traumatic. She didn't agree to sleep with due because you told you like her or will call her..  She agreed to do it because it's a part of sugar relationship.. Which requires sugar.... Otherwise she wouldn't.... It complitely different to \"call\"... Such a dirty feeling of being used, in many cases she did it not for her pleasure... And being left naked, slut-shamed, \"haha, I just canceled it, bitch\" is super traumatic. Girls take intimate moments deeper inside then men usually do....",

I'm actually a lawyer. \n\nWhile you're correct that rape has a legal definition, you omitted the fact that the definition in some jurisdictions allows for claims of rape by fraud or rape by deception. The idea being that if the rape statute mentions that rape is sex without consent, that consent isn't actually meaningful consent if there was fraud or deception present. Just like you can't enforce a contract signed under fraudulent or materially deceptive conditions. \n\nIt's definitely a more modern view of rape. Old statutes focus on force rather than consent. But those statues are being change because the law is recognizing that the majority of rapes are not the stranger jumping out of a bush to hold a knife to your throat. The majority of rapes are a lot less black and white, but victims still need protection. \n\nAlso arguing with OP about what rape is legally defined as when you don't even know what country she's in is dumb. There's a HUGE range of law across the world, and there's a huge range of laws even between the states.",

                    "body": "I'm an attorney, as well.  I agree that a few statutes or attempts at revising statutes focus on the difference of consent and assent.  California probably has the most liberal statute and even that has never been applied to a case where one person agreed to have sex for money and didn't get paid. Those cases are almost strictly applied in two areas.  The first is an act of impersonation where it's a dark room and the other person believes she is having sex with her boyfriend/husband when it's someone else.  The other instance involves a professional, such as a doctor or nurse who sexually assaults someone under the guise of medical treatment.  Think Dr. Nasser and the US Olympic Gymnastics/Swimming programs.  \n\nIf all the guy did was agree to pay and then renege after the deed is done, that is technically theft of services or breach of contract.  Since prostitution is illegal in almost every county in the US and the SB is unlikely to be a licensed prostitute working in a licensed brothel in bumfuck, NV it's not actionable.  \n\nObviously, is actionable if the elements of forcible rape are present. etc.  I'm talking strictly about failing to complete the commercial transaction, here.\n\nI'm restricting my comments to the USA.  \n\nIf you can cite any US cases that say otherwise, I'm all eyes.",

That flies in the face reality where men lose marriages and custody battles because they weren\u2019t smart.  I can tell you stories about how a former SB of mine moved in with a guy and then filed over a dozen lawsuits against him based on BS theories like \u201crape for not paying\u201d.  They all got tossed out of Court but it cost him thousands to get rid of her.  She then tried to sue the cops and the judge.  His reputation was trashed.  She got committed to a psyche ward.

First, you mischaracterize my position.  I think giving a SB the stiff Richard and then stiffing them is wrong.  That guy is a thief.  So is the SB that hints at having sex then bails as soon as she gets paid.  As I stated, it\u2019s called \u201ctheft of services\u201d or \u201cbreach of contract\u201d. It can be a crime but in most instances it\u2019s a civil matter.  You have to sue to get your money.  The problem is that in the eyes of the law, the SB and the SD are engaging in an illegal activity (prostitution) and they won\u2019t recognize it as a crime or a valid civil action.  I don\u2019t make those rules.  It\u2019s the law.  It\u2019s also completely in control of the SB or SD.  If you don\u2019t want to get scammed don\u2019t suck the guy\u2019s dick until he pays you. Pretty simple, really.  The more important thing is to make sure you are safe from physical harm.  That\u2019s where I do think a SB is at a disadvantage and needs to take precautions.  Same with the chance of pregnancy.  That is lopsided for obvious reasons.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear that you are closed minded and want to blame \u201cmen\u201d.  It\u2019s a two-way street.",

However, the few terrible experiences I\u2019ve had were far more than enough to make me set irrevocable and unconditional rules in place, for myself. Any POT that takes issue with these rules can kick fucking rocks. No amount of money or companionship is worth my physical safety and mental health. \n\nAfter going to a hotel following a three-hour first dinner date with a POT, being intimate for *hours,* and watching him \u201cexcuse himself to the bathroom,\u201d only to grab the cash he\u2019d set on the dresser and bolt out the door, sending me a text five minutes later saying, \u201cthanks for the hot fun, feel free to stay in the room tonight,\u201d I\u2019ll *never* partake in intimacy without receiving the PPM first until a SR is well beyond established. \n\nAfter going to a POT\u2019s rental on the *third* date for our first intimate encounter, having a couple of glasses of wine, consenting to light touching and kissing but *not* consenting to sex and loudly saying, \u201cno,\u201d as he forced himself inside of me, continuing until he finished and then leaving me sobbing and naked while he dressed and left, I\u2019ll *never* ignore my gut feeling, again, nor will I *ever* consume alcohol on a sugar date. I felt uncomfortable with him, upon entering the room, and chose to have a few drinks to \u201cloosen up.\u201d Biggest mistake I ever made in the bowl. \n\nAfter agreeing to an allowance from the start with a new SD (he gave me a generous cash gift at the M&G, effectively earning my trust), only to have five intimate dates with him over the course of a month and then get ghosted, never receiving an allowance or a goodbye, I\u2019ll *never* accept an allowance over PPM before the SR is well established, again. PPM doesn\u2019t only protect SDs, y\u2019all! Get it and get it in *cash,* before clothes come off, until you truly and entirely trust each other! \n\nAll of this happened to me early on in my sugaring experience. I was a young, naive little thing. I\u2019ve always made a conscious effort to see the best in people and am both honest and optimistic to a fault. I learned several extremely harsh lessons in the most difficult of ways. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m able to use my experience to help new SBs, now. There\u2019s gotta be a silver lining!

Having trouble sleeping in a bed with someone after because he attacked you when you were sleeping and disoriented. You had let your guard down and decided to trust him and after you let your guard down he hurt you. Wondering if there was anything you could have done and recalculating it over and over like a rubik's cube puzzle to determine if you could have prevented it. Having to realize that the SD could be out there hurting other women and if you go the legal route your name will be dragged in the mud and you will have legal bills like the women you've known who tried to report their attackers. So I don't pity the man. If a psycho SB blows up his life by outing their relationship, that's fucked up, but he CHOSE to go outside his marriage knowing it could blow up accidentally even.

A woman would have to be completely bonkers or have a really good reason to do that. Most people would never - because that involves literally physically traumatising yourself for your outcome - and human nature is such that we generally don't want to assault ourselves lmao. \n\nPerfectly \"sane\", otherwise \"reasonable\" men rape/sexually assault women regularly. Due to cultural factors, many men - especially men in positions of power - simply do not consider what they are doing as wrong or rape, or don't care. They just view it as taking what they want (self centred), and they don't consider/care the consequences on the other person. It's not vengeance or psychosis, it's sheer inconsideration. Raping someone does not involve physically harming yourself, so it is MUCH easier to do, and is therefore MUCH more common. The statistics and science bears this out. This is even MORE true in SW or sugaring relationships where the power dynamics and dehumanisation is even stronger. Many more people (so not just men) are people who commit/have committed sexual assault/rape than are people who would bash their own face up for vengeance. \n\nI'm just not sure why you want to derail a post about SBs being raped/abused to talk about \"bad things happen to men too\". Most of us know that. It's just no where near as common. \n\nAnd even then, when it were to happen (rarely), there is still something viscerally more traumatic (you can look into the science behind trauma for evidence of this) about having your body violated than being blackmailed or losing your job/family is. You can lose everything material... and still feel SAFE on a fundamental, physical level. This is not true for rape. \n\nA person can live their life, never feeling safe in their own body ever again due to rape/sexual assault. The same cannot be said for any of the things listed that happen to SDs. You can't escape the impact of sexual assault/rape. It lives with you, in your nervous system, (read The Body Keeps Score for the science behind this). No amount of material wealth will fix that. You can't move away, find a new wife, make more money, make friends etc to move past it and mitigate the impacts. None of that will actually help. \n \nYou are trapped, in a body that is haunting you with the memories of abuse, forever. You learn to cope... but you will never be the same, because nothing you lost was material. What you lost was your body being a safe space, and your own. For some, you will wake up screaming in the middle of the night because you're having a somatic flashback (experiencing the physical sensation over again) and it won't stop hurting. Even the criminal justice system can't take that way, or recompense you for that. \n\nI genuinely think half this issue is that many men can't even begin to understand/empathise with what it would be like to have their body violated like that, so they try to make comparisons to things they can imagine happening - but it just isn't the same. \n\nAnd the fact you do that - not to better empathise with people? But to derail the conversation and go \"oh woe is me, someone could hurt me in this entirely different way too!!! stop complaining about rape!!!\" (because let's be clear, that is the subtext here in the context of this post) is a huge red flag about your inability to empathise with other people and instead make things about you. \n\nAn inability to consider/empathise with other people and instead return focus back to you, your outcomes and what you want/might be hurt by? Is the first slippery step down the pathway of ending up the men I spoke about earlier. The supposedly \"sane\" ones, who just don't realise or don't care about the consequences of their actions on others because they are too wrapped up in their own minds. It's where people who commit sexual assault/rape start out. \n\nConsider this your warning. You've started down the path. You might've already reached the finish line. It's not too late to turn back and become better person who doesn't think solely in terms of themselves. \n\nBut what are the chances you'll change? With a mindset like yours?",

California probably has the most liberal statute and even that has never been applied to a case where one person agreed to have sex for money and didn't get paid. Those cases are almost strictly applied in two areas.  The first is an act of impersonation where it's a dark room and the other person believes she is having sex with her boyfriend/husband when it's someone else.  The other instance involves a professional, such as a doctor or nurse who sexually assaults someone under the guise of medical treatment.  Think Dr. Nasser and the US Olympic Gymnastics/Swimming programs.  \n\nIf all the guy did was agree to pay and then renege after the deed is done, that is technically theft of services or breach of contract.  Since prostitution is illegal in almost every county in the US and the SB is unlikely to be a licensed prostitute working in a licensed brothel in bumfuck, NV it's not actionable.  \n\nObviously, is actionable if the elements of forcible rape are present. etc.  I'm talking strictly about failing to complete the commercial transaction, here.\n\nI'm restricting my comments to the USA.  \n\nIf you can cite any US cases that say otherwise, I'm all eyes.",

I can tell you stories about how a former SB of mine moved in with a guy and then filed over a dozen lawsuits against him based on BS theories like \u201crape for not paying\u201d.  They all got tossed out of Court but it cost him thousands to get rid of her.  She then tried to sue the cops and the judge.  His reputation was trashed.  She got committed to a psyche ward.

But for some reason in your eyes it's no biggie if it's a woman who gets taken advantage of. You little story about a buddy of yours is something that happens very rarely, hence you don't hear about it. You are on this sub reading every day how much women get abused and taken advantage of and you mean to claim risks are the same. Nothing more to expect from a man, we are always somehow blamed for everything men do. Pointless conversation. Cheers",

First, you mischaracterize my position.  I think giving a SB the stiff Richard and then stiffing them is wrong.  That guy is a thief.  So is the SB that hints at having sex then bails as soon as she gets paid.  As I stated, it\u2019s called \u201ctheft of services\u201d or \u201cbreach of contract\u201d. It can be a crime but in most instances it\u2019s a civil matter.  You have to sue to get your money.  The problem is that in the eyes of the law, the SB and the SD are engaging in an illegal activity (prostitution) and they won\u2019t recognize it as a crime or a valid civil action.  I don\u2019t make those rules.  It\u2019s the law.  It\u2019s also completely in control of the SB or SD.  If you don\u2019t want to get scammed don\u2019t suck the guy\u2019s dick until he pays you. Pretty simple, really.  The more important thing is to make sure you are safe from physical harm.  That\u2019s where I do think a SB is at a disadvantage and needs to take precautions.  Same with the chance of pregnancy.  That is lopsided for obvious reasons.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear that you are closed minded and want to blame \u201cmen\u201d.  It\u2019s a two-way street.",

A woman would have to be completely bonkers or have a really good reason to do that. Most people would never - because that involves literally physically traumatising yourself for your outcome - and human nature is such that we generally don't want to assault ourselves lmao. \n\nPerfectly \"sane\", otherwise \"reasonable\" men rape/sexually assault women regularly. Due to cultural factors, many men - especially men in positions of power - simply do not consider what they are doing as wrong or rape, or don't care. They just view it as taking what they want (self centred), and they don't consider/care the consequences on the other person. It's not vengeance or psychosis, it's sheer inconsideration. Raping someone does not involve physically harming yourself, so it is MUCH easier to do, and is therefore MUCH more common. The statistics and science bears this out. This is even MORE true in SW or sugaring relationships where the power dynamics and dehumanisation is even stronger. Many more people (so not just men) are people who commit/have committed sexual assault/rape than are people who would bash their own face up for vengeance. \n\nI'm just not sure why you want to derail a post about SBs being raped/abused to talk about \"bad things happen to men too\". Most of us know that. It's just no where near as common. \n\nAnd even then, when it were to happen (rarely), there is still something viscerally more traumatic (you can look into the science behind trauma for evidence of this) about having your body violated than being blackmailed or losing your job/family is. You can lose everything material... and still feel SAFE on a fundamental, physical level. This is not true for rape. \n\nA person can live their life, never feeling safe in their own body ever again due to rape/sexual assault. The same cannot be said for any of the things listed that happen to SDs. You can't escape the impact of sexual assault/rape. It lives with you, in your nervous system, (read The Body Keeps Score for the science behind this). No amount of material wealth will fix that. You can't move away, find a new wife, make more money, make friends etc to move past it and mitigate the impacts. None of that will actually help. \n \nYou are trapped, in a body that is haunting you with the memories of abuse, forever. You learn to cope... but you will never be the same, because nothing you lost was material. What you lost was your body being a safe space, and your own. For some, you will wake up screaming in the middle of the night because you're having a somatic flashback (experiencing the physical sensation over again) and it won't stop hurting. Even the criminal justice system can't take that way, or recompense you for that. \n\nI genuinely think half this issue is that many men can't even begin to understand/empathise with what it would be like to have their body violated like that, so they try to make comparisons to things they can imagine happening - but it just isn't the same. \n\nAnd the fact you do that - not to better empathise with people? But to derail the conversation and go \"oh woe is me, someone could hurt me in this entirely different way too!!! stop complaining about rape!!!\" (because let's be clear, that is the subtext here in the context of this post) is a huge red flag about your inability to empathise with other people and instead make things about you. \n\nAn inability to consider/empathise with other people and instead return focus back to you, your outcomes and what you want/might be hurt by? Is the first slippery step down the pathway of ending up the men I spoke about earlier. The supposedly \"sane\" ones, who just don't realise or don't care about the consequences of their actions on others because they are too wrapped up in their own minds. It's where people who commit sexual assault/rape start out. \n\nConsider this your warning. You've started down the path. You might've already reached the finish line. It's not too late to turn back and become better person who doesn't think solely in terms of themselves. \n\nBut what are the chances you'll change? With a mindset like yours?",

I can tell you stories about how a former SB of mine moved in with a guy and then filed over a dozen lawsuits against him based on BS theories like \u201crape for not paying\u201d.  They all got tossed out of Court but it cost him thousands to get rid of her.  She then tried to sue the cops and the judge.  His reputation was trashed.  She got committed to a psyche ward.

First, you mischaracterize my position.  I think giving a SB the stiff Richard and then stiffing them is wrong.  That guy is a thief.  So is the SB that hints at having sex then bails as soon as she gets paid.  As I stated, it\u2019s called \u201ctheft of services\u201d or \u201cbreach of contract\u201d. It can be a crime but in most instances it\u2019s a civil matter.  You have to sue to get your money.  The problem is that in the eyes of the law, the SB and the SD are engaging in an illegal activity (prostitution) and they won\u2019t recognize it as a crime or a valid civil action.  I don\u2019t make those rules.  It\u2019s the law.  It\u2019s also completely in control of the SB or SD.  If you don\u2019t want to get scammed don\u2019t suck the guy\u2019s dick until he pays you. Pretty simple, really.  The more important thing is to make sure you are safe from physical harm.  That\u2019s where I do think a SB is at a disadvantage and needs to take precautions.  Same with the chance of pregnancy.  That is lopsided for obvious reasons.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear that you are closed minded and want to blame \u201cmen\u201d.  It\u2019s a two-way street.",

                            "body": "Women literally beating themselves in order to punish men, as far as I can tell from any crime statistics I've seen, is really quite rare? A woman would have to be completely bonkers or have a really good reason to do that. Most people would never - because that involves literally physically traumatising yourself for your outcome - and human nature is such that we generally don't want to assault ourselves lmao. \n\nPerfectly \"sane\", otherwise \"reasonable\" men rape/sexually assault women regularly. Due to cultural factors, many men - especially men in positions of power - simply do not consider what they are doing as wrong or rape, or don't care. They just view it as taking what they want (self centred), and they don't consider/care the consequences on the other person. It's not vengeance or psychosis, it's sheer inconsideration. Raping someone does not involve physically harming yourself, so it is MUCH easier to do, and is therefore MUCH more common. The statistics and science bears this out. This is even MORE true in SW or sugaring relationships where the power dynamics and dehumanisation is even stronger. Many more people (so not just men) are people who commit/have committed sexual assault/rape than are people who would bash their own face up for vengeance. \n\nI'm just not sure why you want to derail a post about SBs being raped/abused to talk about \"bad things happen to men too\". Most of us know that. It's just no where near as common. \n\nAnd even then, when it were to happen (rarely), there is still something viscerally more traumatic (you can look into the science behind trauma for evidence of this) about having your body violated than being blackmailed or losing your job/family is. You can lose everything material... and still feel SAFE on a fundamental, physical level. This is not true for rape. \n\nA person can live their life, never feeling safe in their own body ever again due to rape/sexual assault. The same cannot be said for any of the things listed that happen to SDs. You can't escape the impact of sexual assault/rape. It lives with you, in your nervous system, (read The Body Keeps Score for the science behind this). No amount of material wealth will fix that. You can't move away, find a new wife, make more money, make friends etc to move past it and mitigate the impacts. None of that will actually help. \n \nYou are trapped, in a body that is haunting you with the memories of abuse, forever. You learn to cope... but you will never be the same, because nothing you lost was material. What you lost was your body being a safe space, and your own. For some, you will wake up screaming in the middle of the night because you're having a somatic flashback (experiencing the physical sensation over again) and it won't stop hurting. Even the criminal justice system can't take that way, or recompense you for that. \n\nI genuinely think half this issue is that many men can't even begin to understand/empathise with what it would be like to have their body violated like that, so they try to make comparisons to things they can imagine happening - but it just isn't the same. \n\nAnd the fact you do that - not to better empathise with people? But to derail the conversation and go \"oh woe is me, someone could hurt me in this entirely different way too!!! stop complaining about rape!!!\" (because let's be clear, that is the subtext here in the context of this post) is a huge red flag about your inability to empathise with other people and instead make things about you. \n\nAn inability to consider/empathise with other people and instead return focus back to you, your outcomes and what you want/might be hurt by? Is the first slippery step down the pathway of ending up the men I spoke about earlier. The supposedly \"sane\" ones, who just don't realise or don't care about the consequences of their actions on others because they are too wrapped up in their own minds. It's where people who commit sexual assault/rape start out. \n\nConsider this your warning. You've started down the path. You might've already reached the finish line. It's not too late to turn back and become better person who doesn't think solely in terms of themselves. \n\nBut what are the chances you'll change? With a mindset like yours?",

First, you mischaracterize my position.  I think giving a SB the stiff Richard and then stiffing them is wrong.  That guy is a thief.  So is the SB that hints at having sex then bails as soon as she gets paid.  As I stated, it\u2019s called \u201ctheft of services\u201d or \u201cbreach of contract\u201d. It can be a crime but in most instances it\u2019s a civil matter.  You have to sue to get your money.  The problem is that in the eyes of the law, the SB and the SD are engaging in an illegal activity (prostitution) and they won\u2019t recognize it as a crime or a valid civil action.  I don\u2019t make those rules.  It\u2019s the law.  It\u2019s also completely in control of the SB or SD.  If you don\u2019t want to get scammed don\u2019t suck the guy\u2019s dick until he pays you. Pretty simple, really.  The more important thing is to make sure you are safe from physical harm.  That\u2019s where I do think a SB is at a disadvantage and needs to take precautions.

                    "body": "Women literally beating themselves in order to punish men, as far as I can tell from any crime statistics I've seen, is really quite rare? A woman would have to be completely bonkers or have a really good reason to do that. Most people would never - because that involves literally physically traumatising yourself for your outcome - and human nature is such that we generally don't want to assault ourselves lmao. \n\nPerfectly \"sane\", otherwise \"reasonable\" men rape/sexually assault women regularly. Due to cultural factors, many men - especially men in positions of power - simply do not consider what they are doing as wrong or rape, or don't care. They just view it as taking what they want (self centred), and they don't consider/care the consequences on the other person. It's not vengeance or psychosis, it's sheer inconsideration. Raping someone does not involve physically harming yourself, so it is MUCH easier to do, and is therefore MUCH more common. The statistics and science bears this out. This is even MORE true in SW or sugaring relationships where the power dynamics and dehumanisation is even stronger. Many more people (so not just men) are people who commit/have committed sexual assault/rape than are people who would bash their own face up for vengeance. \n\nI'm just not sure why you want to derail a post about SBs being raped/abused to talk about \"bad things happen to men too\". Most of us know that. It's just no where near as common. \n\nAnd even then, when it were to happen (rarely), there is still something viscerally more traumatic (you can look into the science behind trauma for evidence of this) about having your body violated than being blackmailed or losing your job/family is. You can lose everything material... and still feel SAFE on a fundamental, physical level. This is not true for rape. \n\nA person can live their life, never feeling safe in their own body ever again due to rape/sexual assault. The same cannot be said for any of the things listed that happen to SDs. You can't escape the impact of sexual assault/rape. It lives with you, in your nervous system, (read The Body Keeps Score for the science behind this). No amount of material wealth will fix that. You can't move away, find a new wife, make more money, make friends etc to move past it and mitigate the impacts. None of that will actually help. \n \nYou are trapped, in a body that is haunting you with the memories of abuse, forever. You learn to cope... but you will never be the same, because nothing you lost was material. What you lost was your body being a safe space, and your own. For some, you will wake up screaming in the middle of the night because you're having a somatic flashback (experiencing the physical sensation over again) and it won't stop hurting. Even the criminal justice system can't take that way, or recompense you for that. \n\nI genuinely think half this issue is that many men can't even begin to understand/empathise with what it would be like to have their body violated like that, so they try to make comparisons to things they can imagine happening - but it just isn't the same. \n\nAnd the fact you do that - not to better empathise with people? But to derail the conversation and go \"oh woe is me, someone could hurt me in this entirely different way too!!! stop complaining about rape!!!\" (because let's be clear, that is the subtext here in the context of this post) is a huge red flag about your inability to empathise with other people and instead make things about you. \n\nAn inability to consider/empathise with other people and instead return focus back to you, your outcomes and what you want/might be hurt by? Is the first slippery step down the pathway of ending up the men I spoke about earlier. The supposedly \"sane\" ones, who just don't realise or don't care about the consequences of their actions on others because they are too wrapped up in their own minds. It's where people who commit sexual assault/rape start out. \n\nConsider this your warning. You've started down the path. You might've already reached the finish line. It's not too late to turn back and become better person who doesn't think solely in terms of themselves. \n\nBut what are the chances you'll change? With a mindset like yours?",

The problem is that in the eyes of the law, the SB and the SD are engaging in an illegal activity (prostitution) and they won\u2019t recognize it as a crime or a valid civil action.  I don\u2019t make those rules.  It\u2019s the law.  It\u2019s also completely in control of the SB or SD.  If you don\u2019t want to get scammed don\u2019t suck the guy\u2019s dick until he pays you.

            "body": "Women literally beating themselves in order to punish men, as far as I can tell from any crime statistics I've seen, is really quite rare? A woman would have to be completely bonkers or have a really good reason to do that. Most people would never - because that involves literally physically traumatising yourself for your outcome - and human nature is such that we generally don't want to assault ourselves lmao. \n\nPerfectly \"sane\", otherwise \"reasonable\" men rape/sexually assault women regularly. Due to cultural factors, many men - especially men in positions of power - simply do not consider what they are doing as wrong or rape, or don't care. They just view it as taking what they want (self centred), and they don't consider/care the consequences on the other person. It's not vengeance or psychosis, it's sheer inconsideration. Raping someone does not involve physically harming yourself, so it is MUCH easier to do, and is therefore MUCH more common. The statistics and science bears this out. This is even MORE true in SW or sugaring relationships where the power dynamics and dehumanisation is even stronger. Many more people (so not just men) are people who commit/have committed sexual assault/rape than are people who would bash their own face up for vengeance. \n\nI'm just not sure why you want to derail a post about SBs being raped/abused to talk about \"bad things happen to men too\". Most of us know that. It's just no where near as common. \n\nAnd even then, when it were to happen (rarely), there is still something viscerally more traumatic (you can look into the science behind trauma for evidence of this) about having your body violated than being blackmailed or losing your job/family is. You can lose everything material... and still feel SAFE on a fundamental, physical level. This is not true for rape. \n\nA person can live their life, never feeling safe in their own body ever again due to rape/sexual assault. The same cannot be said for any of the things listed that happen to SDs. You can't escape the impact of sexual assault/rape. It lives with you, in your nervous system, (read The Body Keeps Score for the science behind this). No amount of material wealth will fix that. You can't move away, find a new wife, make more money, make friends etc to move past it and mitigate the impacts. None of that will actually help. \n \nYou are trapped, in a body that is haunting you with the memories of abuse, forever. You learn to cope... but you will never be the same, because nothing you lost was material. What you lost was your body being a safe space, and your own. For some, you will wake up screaming in the middle of the night because you're having a somatic flashback (experiencing the physical sensation over again) and it won't stop hurting. Even the criminal justice system can't take that way, or recompense you for that. \n\nI genuinely think half this issue is that many men can't even begin to understand/empathise with what it would be like to have their body violated like that, so they try to make comparisons to things they can imagine happening - but it just isn't the same. \n\nAnd the fact you do that - not to better empathise with people? But to derail the conversation and go \"oh woe is me, someone could hurt me in this entirely different way too!!! stop complaining about rape!!!\" (because let's be clear, that is the subtext here in the context of this post) is a huge red flag about your inability to empathise with other people and instead make things about you. \n\nAn inability to consider/empathise with other people and instead return focus back to you, your outcomes and what you want/might be hurt by? Is the first slippery step down the pathway of ending up the men I spoke about earlier. The supposedly \"sane\" ones, who just don't realise or don't care about the consequences of their actions on others because they are too wrapped up in their own minds. It's where people who commit sexual assault/rape start out. \n\nConsider this your warning. You've started down the path. You might've already reached the finish line. It's not too late to turn back and become better person who doesn't think solely in terms of themselves. \n\nBut what are the chances you'll change? With a mindset like yours?",

You\u2019ve got a screwed up moral compass.  You also think that the damage to reputation goes only one way?  That flies in the face reality where men lose marriages and custody battles because they weren\u2019t smart.  I can tell you stories about how a former SB of mine moved in with a guy and then filed over a dozen lawsuits against him based on BS theories like \u201crape for not paying\u201d.  They all got tossed out of Court but it cost him thousands to get rid of her.  She then tried to sue the cops and the judge.  His reputation was trashed.  She got committed to a psyche ward.  Bad shit happens.  I\u2019ll be blunt, if you can\u2019t abide the risk, do something else.  No one is forcing you to have sex for money.",

            "body": "It\u2019s a pointless conversation because you are intellectually dishonest or your deductive reasoning is poor.  First, you mischaracterize my position.  I think giving a SB the stiff Richard and then stiffing them is wrong.  That guy is a thief.  So is the SB that hints at having sex then bails as soon as she gets paid.  As I stated, it\u2019s called \u201ctheft of services\u201d or \u201cbreach of contract\u201d. It can be a crime but in most instances it\u2019s a civil matter.  You have to sue to get your money.  The problem is that in the eyes of the law, the SB and the SD are engaging in an illegal activity (prostitution) and they won\u2019t recognize it as a crime or a valid civil action.  I don\u2019t make those rules.  It\u2019s the law.  It\u2019s also completely in control of the SB or SD.  If you don\u2019t want to get scammed don\u2019t suck the guy\u2019s dick until he pays you. Pretty simple, really.  The more important thing is to make sure you are safe from physical harm.  That\u2019s where I do think a SB is at a disadvantage and needs to take precautions.  Same with the chance of pregnancy.  That is lopsided for obvious reasons.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear that you are closed minded and want to blame \u201cmen\u201d.  It\u2019s a two-way street.",
