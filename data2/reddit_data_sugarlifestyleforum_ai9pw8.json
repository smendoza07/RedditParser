    "body": "WTF. The amount of men I meet that have this as their demand fucking baffles me. I didn\u2019t start having raw sex with my bf until we were 2 years into the relationship and I was on the pill. Why the fuck would an SD think he can wave some money around and fuck raw?  Disgusting and disrespectful. I\u2019m losing so much hope in finding a decent SD that actually has some common sense and respect.\n\nEdit: May I add, I have nothing against SRs that have already established trust, consent and have tested. I\u2019m talking about SDs who (from my experience) specifically \u201crequire\u201d their SB to not use protection from the beginning. It\u2019s just ridiculous and honestly scary that a stranger asks you to trust them enough to put your own health in jeopardy. The amount of SDs that tried to manipulate me with money or with tantrums into unprotected sex is just scary and messed up.  So sorry if I\u2019m coming across as a negative Nancy but I\u2019m just losing faith in finding a sensible SD who doesn\u2019t throw tantrums for me being \u201cimmature\u201d and caring for my sexual health.

I\u2019m not looking for that in an SR, thus I would never forgo condoms.  I will say that If you\u2019re in a long term committed SR and that\u2019s something you want to do, then sure.  That\u2019s totally fine and that\u2019s your decision to make.  Trust has been built and you know each other.  \n\nIf he\u2019s asking to go bare, he likes bare sex.   That means he probably doesn\u2019t use condoms whenever he doesn\u2019t have to.  If he\u2019s asking me to not use condoms right off the bat and he doesn\u2019t know me that well, that means he\u2019s very likely doing that to other women as well.  In short, it means he\u2019s cavalier about his sexual health and engages in risky behavior.  All of that is what enforces my decision to never not use condoms.\n\nGuys who are asking for it are too risky for me, personally.  Even if they agree to use a condom with me, I wouldn\u2019t go forward.  I know they likely engage in risky sex, and I know they don\u2019t like condoms so it\u2019ll probably come up again in the future.  I\u2019d also be worried they would be more likely to try to stealth me at some point by slipping the condom without me noticing.\n\nThe reality is there\u2019s way too many guys who are totally happy to wear them than to put up with the ones who whine about it.  \n\n",

Most sbs I've met haven't heard of this sub or even Reddit, especially if they're younger.  \n\nIn my experience only 1 out of 3 sbs even mentions condoms.   I am the usually one who brings them up.  I've actually had more than one react negatively, getting offended that I think they're \"dirty\" or something.\n\nMy m.o. is to ask \"what are your limitations?\" before things get too hot & heavy.  The usual response I get is pretty vague.  They're typically down for whatever I want to do and seem to expect to have vaginal sex bare as a matter of course.  \n\nIt seems to me extraordinarily reckless to go bare with a guy you barely know, but like I said, 2/3 of sbs are cool with it.  \n\nI am too anxious myself to go bare without building trust and getting mutually tested.  I let a new sb perform oral on me unprotected once and I agonized over possible STD transmission for weeks, then got tested & again several weeks after that.  She was clean but it's not worth the stress to me.\n\nCondoms are 98% effective against pregnancy and 99% effective against HIV, gonnoreah, syphilis, and clamydia when used correctly.  The people on here saying they are 85% is not because they fail, it's because of human error.  They will not necessarily protect against herpes and genital warts which are spread by skin-to-skin contact, but I like my chances against those with a condom better than without.",

Then they whine and act flabbergasted that you would want protection, as if bareback is a given. When this happened to me it was very uncomfortable to put my clothes back on and straight up leave after receiving a 10 minute explanation of why bareback was ok and having him pull up his medical records. This kind of behavior leaves a new SB feeling very pressured to just give in (sunk cost effect), especially if the money was supposed to come afterwards. \n\nI mean obviously \"no money no honey\" but most SBs never see this forum and are young and naive, and SDs are grown men and should behave better. This behavior is rampant in the sugar world. I once went on a M&G with a guy who seemed off - I later found out was blacklisted for pressuring many many SBs into bareback sex and then bailing. Not sure if this is still allowed on SA but I would recommend SBs just awkwardly bring up protection very bluntly as a non-negotiable in the first 3 messages, you'd be surprised just how many SDs have this as a dealbreaker but won't bring it up til you've wasted your time flirting and waxing and primping.

I would be called either one of the very last boomers or one of the very first of Gen X (depending where exactly you put the cut-off date).  I'm in my early/mid 50s.\n\nCertainly as a teenager and in my very early 20s no one considered ever using a condom and, of course, contraception (or \"birth control\" as I think Americans call it) is free in this country.\n\nThe first big TV campaigns around AIDS awareness came out in this country when I was 22 and I think there was quite a big shift in attitudes back then.  It was certainly only after that time that I used a condom for the first ever time.\n\nI remember a couple of years ago talking to some people who are about 5 to 10 years younger than I am.  So, they're right in the middle of Gen X and were still in school when the AIDS campaigns were airing and it was being discussed in school.

Yes, SBs should be taking safety measures, but the fact is, most of them don't or don't know how to. We are talking 55 year old successful businessmen who have years of experience in negotiation vs 21 year old girls with no life experience who need the money and who have been raised to be polite and charming. Add in the fact that they chose to be SBs because they don't want the prostitute label, but bringing up money \"too early\" often leads to some very hurtful and vindictive accusations. In a playing field like this, there has to be some more moral responsibility on the SD's part.\n\nLastly, it's very evident to me that the SDs who do this have done it a million times with the *clear* intention of manipulating naive girls into doing something the SD knows they aren't comfortable with.

And even then we mean it as a very occasional thing and followed up with a morning after pill despite her being on bc. Breeding fantasies may be hot but making actual babies not so much for us. \n\nBut back to the respect and std part of the issue. Our arrangement doesn't require exclusivity and we both have regular open relationships so protection is something we take seriously. Nobody wants to spread an std to our extended circle of partners.\n\nBut she got in a bad situation financially early on in our arrangement, through no fault of her own, that was just so bad that I couldn't afford to take care of it completely no matter how much I wanted to. \n\nSo she had to seek out another a second arrangement and of course the only guy who is serious and actually offers what she's worth ect ect insists on only unprotected sex from day one. She doesn't want to but she's in a bad situation and desperate. Skip to the end, dude gives her gonorrhea. So now she's in an even worse pave since she can't exactly go seeking other SD until that's cleared up and of course it puts the arrangement we sneezy had at risk too. \n\nI just can't understand why these so called SDs want to put themselves and the girls they are supposed to care about at risk this way. I honestly think of them as predators hunting down desperate women. ",

            "body": "I am a no condom guy and want to share my thoughts on the issue.\n\nLooking at the issue from the perspective of an SB, I can definitely see how the power imbalance in a sugar relationship and ratio disparity of SDs to SBs creates an environment where many SDs show a very ugly side of themselves to pots.  While I have a preference for no condoms, I am willing to use them in the beginning to help an pot SB develop a level of comfort with me (as well as test results and so on).  I also spend alot of time up front getting to know a pot SB, so that I have a good sense of them (their sexual history, potential exclusivity, general honesty, etc).    And I am willing to be exclusive in the relationship in order to lower their risks as well.\n\nFinding out if a pot SB is willing to forgo condoms is a delicate issue - I don't really want to talk about it until I really know them as I realize most SBs would find this creepy to ask for no condoms in an abstract conversation in text before meeting (or at least I have heard them say so).\n\nI disagree with the concept that because I want to have uncovered sex, then I am some kind of man slut who is reckless and doesn't care about anyone's health.  I feel like the opposite is true in that it makes me much more selective about who I want to be with.  I view the SR as no different than a regular relationship except with sugar added, so I treat my SB like a girlfriend.\n\nI am in between SBs right now and looking for my next long term SR.  So I had two dates with pot SBs that I had spent alot of time talking to and felt very compatible with.  The first one, when it was time for sex, asked me to wear protection and I did.  I only went one round as I just dislike condoms so much.   Although all other parts of the interaction were great, this was a massive mood killer.  The second pot SB mentioned condoms before we met and said she prefers if I wear them on the first time.  I said I would do what is comfortable for her but preferred not to use them in the long run.  After we met, we talked further about it (her raising the issue, not me pressuring her) and because of the combination of liking each other alot, developing some trust, sharing test results, we were intimate without them.  I don't want to say that was the sole basis that I will choose the second one, but things just seemed to flow more naturally and the intimacy was mind blowing rather than perfunctory.\n\nOne last thing to say on the condom/no condom issue is that for me, this issue separates more submissive SBs from more dominant ones.  With all my life experiences of multiple long term relationships and marriages, I know the type of woman I am most compatible and happy with.  I had enough relationships that involved some sort of power struggle that I know for sure that I prefer a naturally submissive woman.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

            "body": "Rant: the moralizing on this forum about this.\n\n1) No one can \"demand\" anything of someone. It takes two. If you don't like the situation, leave and never look back.\n\n2) It's not \"disgusting and disrespectful\" to express one's preferences.\n\n3) It's bizarre how much people literally rant about this over and over on the forums yet they engage in all the unprotected oral in the world. It's certainly true condoms are effective -- to a point -- at preventing some major STIs. And yet if your mouth goes on his, or his on yours... without a barrier... well many of those same STIs will transmit just fine. They'll surely applaud your condom usage on genital-to-genital contact though!\n\n4) You can get tested regularly. In this life, you should get tested regularly. No, it's not perfect because of incubation. No, it's not perfect unless you're monogamous. But guess what? Not all of us sleep around. Some of us just sleep with you.\n\n5) Our desire to have sex with you without a condom is not proof:\n\na) that we have an STI/STD\n\nb) that we have multiple partners\n\nc) that we use drugs\n\nd) that we are making something up\n\ne) that we go home and have sex with our wives\n\nBut, lord, read this stuff here enough and you would be sure that the mere suggestion of unprotected sex only comes from disease-ridden psychopaths.\n\n5) Your preference to \"always use protection\" is perfectly reasonable. Ours to go without is also reasonable. You may deem it less reasonable. That's also fine.\n\n6) In my experience 2/3 of SBs will not require a condom or agree to go without one without coercion. That does give one pause. But again, if you're with a finite number of partners, are tested regularly, and have mutual trust it is not \"scary\" or \"messed up\" to do this.\n\n7) You have to do you. That might mean you conclude the mere request is a dealbreaker. I think perhaps I experienced this once and got dumped for it. Of course, it's possible the dumping was for the reason she said (something unrelated to the sex completely).\n\n8) You ought to conclude coercion is a dealbreaker. That said, I think coercion has gotten a pretty broad definition these days. \"I can't really enjoy sex without a condom\" is not automatically coercion. It might well be factual. It might well present a flashpoint for conflict. It might well destroy the nascent SR. But it's not automatically coercion. (Cue the thought police!)\n\n9) Rule #5 talks about sex positivity here. But if enjoying sex requires no barrier between the two people, that's almost always shouted down as insane/perverted/evidence of something awful. \n\n10) I would welcome profiles that made it clear unprotected sex was absolutely never an option. It would save some awkward moments. I would also welcome candor about what it takes to earn that level of trust.\n\n&#x200B;",

These are:\n\n* Trichomonas\n\n* Ureaplasma\n\n* Mycoplasma\n\n* Gardnerella\n\nA lot like cable internet, STD testing in the US is dominated by two nationwide providers - Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp - who have not seen it fit to include these things that have been on STD panels in other countries for over a decade.\n\nAs a result, in the US, it is practically impossible to get tested for this. The only way is with a specific at-home test kit which you can order online, collect a sample at home, and drop it off at UPS to be shipped to the UK. The process is lengthy and awkward - so far I've asked 3 girls to do this and I haven't seen results for a single one.\n\nYou might think, oh, so what? What's the worst if I get ureaplasma? And you're kinda right. Women do not have symptoms, it won't kill you and it does not cause infertility. But it does cause pain during urination in men.\n\nWhat happened to me a few years ago is, a girlfriend caught it when she traveled to the US. Most likely from a long time partner she was in  love with. She noticed nothing, then she returned to Costa Rica and I got it from her. I noticed pain and discomfort immediately, got tested, and bam, ureaplasma.\n\nThis motherfucker took **over a year** to get rid of. Because it's never tested for and people just carry it around and spread it, it's highly antibiotic resistant. The first round took multiple tests, multiple doctor's visits, multiple rounds of antibiotics. Of course my wife got it from me and had to do all these things too. The antibiotics have side effects - one of them is peripheral neuropathy which damages your nerves in a way you might never get rid of!\n\nThis seemed to work, we tested negative, but after several months I got it back from my wife *again*. Again the characteristic pain during urination. It must have survived in some nook. Cue another several months of desperate attempts to clear it: doctors, antibiotics, tests.\n\nAfter **two times** of several courses, we are now finally clear again. I tested negative two times in a row 6 months apart, the last time using the online test I mentioned.\n\nThe US has a lot of things inferior to other countries and STD testing is one of them. US \"clean\" is not clean. A US \"full\" STD panel is not full. And if you try to teach potential partners about this and get them properly tested, good luck. You can give them $300 test kits, they agree to use them and then throw them away.",

I had to answer questions about exposure in a certain way, fishing for Trich to be included.\n\n> there is a reasonable argument to be made that its a waste of time and resources to test for things that have extremely low prevalence in the US population\n\nBut the prevalence of these things is not low. Trichomoniasis causes an awful fishy smell of the genitals, increases risk of other infections, and some [3.7 million](https://www.cdc.gov/std/trichomonas/STDFact-Trichomoniasis.htm) in the US have it. For ureaplasma and mycoplasma I don't know the prevalence, but they are likely at least as common as chlamydia.\n\nPeople who are non-monogamous or serially monogamous should be tested for these. US tests seem to be really geared toward long-term monogamous people who want to get tested once and then have the same partner for 5 years. They're not meant to protect the promiscuous - they protect the monogamous *from* the promiscuous.",

You're saying this is rare, but statistics show its prevalence is high, it just might not always create problems. I'm also confused by your easy-going view of HSV-2. I understand it's not a big deal for 2/3 of its carriers. But it is a big deal for 1/3 and it has serious implications in childbirth. Given that testing and antivirals are one of our few weapons against it, it seems to me we should use them to avoid transmission. Sure, some NN% of people have it, but it's too easy to say it's no big deal when it's just other people who are suffering symptoms.",

Many neonatal infections occur because of asymptomatic cervical shedding of virus, usually after a primary episode of HSV infection.

I can tell you the risk is mostly overblown.  Minus the 1.7 million Chlamydia  and you have 600k people infected with something other than chlamydia per year.  600k out of how many millions are having sex?

If a POT immediately starts discussing PPM and I'm like $X and she is like $1.5X - 2X, I'm usually asking what she is doing to make it extra special.  Otherwise I never bring raw up.  During a M&G and first date, the talk of kids is usually brought up, and I very openly discuss my vasectomy and how it is great not to worry about accidental pregnancy/more kids.  Now this would be a great opportunity for a POT to talk about condoms/birth control etc.  I would say 90% POTs do not.  Now we are onto the first initimate date.  I have condoms on hand, we discuss recent test results, and I would say a lot 75%-90% want to go bare.  Girls like the feel too!\n\nMy weird view is they see the SR as something special and want to please their daddy.  I don't demand it.  This shows most likely she is not fucking around with other dudes since she doesn't want to get me or her sick and ruin the SR.  This shows she did not just have a tinder hook-up or another daddy yesterday/this week and this is something important to her.  I treat it the same way.  If she insists on condoms, I do not put up a fuss, but I may decide to not continue the SR later.  Am I just another random hook-up to her?  How many guys is she seeing concurrently?  My 2c. ",

Putting it in the profile helps SDs select out those for whom they will only be an annoyance.  If it is important it should be in the profile or pre M&G discussions.  \n\nI realize it is a grossly politically incorrect comment, but over more than 10 years of sugaring less than half ( mostly long term relationships with college grads) have wanted to use condoms after the relationship had been established for a month or two. I'm ok either way and they are in the drawer on her side of the bed.  I'm not married and do not feel the need for additional sexual partners beyond my SB.  Yes I realize she may have some age appropriate sexual partners and that's potentially an additional risk factor for me.  I mention this only as a data point and NOT to try to convince anyone to change what makes them comfortable. Great sugar relationships are based on finding compatible expectations and activities.  There are other risk factors that are not negotiable for me. ",

This kind of behavior leaves a new SB feeling very pressured to just give in (sunk cost effect), especially if the money was supposed to come afterwards. \n\nI mean obviously \"no money no honey\" but most SBs never see this forum and are young and naive, and SDs are grown men and should behave better. This behavior is rampant in the sugar world. I once went on a M&G with a guy who seemed off - I later found out was blacklisted for pressuring many many SBs into bareback sex and then bailing. Not sure if this is still allowed on SA but I would recommend SBs just awkwardly bring up protection very bluntly as a non-negotiable in the first 3 messages, you'd be surprised just how many SDs have this as a dealbreaker but won't bring it up til you've wasted your time flirting and waxing and primping.

I would be called either one of the very last boomers or one of the very first of Gen X (depending where exactly you put the cut-off date).  I'm in my early/mid 50s.\n\nCertainly as a teenager and in my very early 20s no one considered ever using a condom and, of course, contraception (or \"birth control\" as I think Americans call it) is free in this country.\n\nThe first big TV campaigns around AIDS awareness came out in this country when I was 22 and I think there was quite a big shift in attitudes back then.  It was certainly only after that time that I used a condom for the first ever time.\n\nI remember a couple of years ago talking to some people who are about 5 to 10 years younger than I am.  So, they're right in the middle of Gen X and were still in school when the AIDS campaigns were airing and it was being discussed in school.  Without exception, they all mentioned how big an effect that had on them, very much like you said, they:-\n\n>came of age in such an atmosphere of fear that condoms weren't even a question, they were a potentially life saving certainty.\n\n\n\n",

In a playing field like this, there has to be some more moral responsibility on the SD's part.\n\nLastly, it's very evident to me that the SDs who do this have done it a million times with the *clear* intention of manipulating naive girls into doing something the SD knows they aren't comfortable with.

These are:\n\n* Trichomonas\n\n* Ureaplasma\n\n* Mycoplasma\n\n* Gardnerella\n\nA lot like cable internet, STD testing in the US is dominated by two nationwide providers - Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp - who have not seen it fit to include these things that have been on STD panels in other countries for over a decade.\n\nAs a result, in the US, it is practically impossible to get tested for this. The only way is with a specific at-home test kit which you can order online, collect a sample at home, and drop it off at UPS to be shipped to the UK. The process is lengthy and awkward - so far I've asked 3 girls to do this and I haven't seen results for a single one.\n\nYou might think, oh, so what? What's the worst if I get ureaplasma? And you're kinda right. Women do not have symptoms, it won't kill you and it does not cause infertility. But it does cause pain during urination in men.\n\nWhat happened to me a few years ago is, a girlfriend caught it when she traveled to the US. Most likely from a long time partner she was in  love with. She noticed nothing, then she returned to Costa Rica and I got it from her. I noticed pain and discomfort immediately, got tested, and bam, ureaplasma.\n\nThis motherfucker took **over a year** to get rid of. Because it's never tested for and people just carry it around and spread it, it's highly antibiotic resistant. The first round took multiple tests, multiple doctor's visits, multiple rounds of antibiotics. Of course my wife got it from me and had to do all these things too. The antibiotics have side effects - one of them is peripheral neuropathy which damages your nerves in a way you might never get rid of!\n\nThis seemed to work, we tested negative, but after several months I got it back from my wife *again*. Again the characteristic pain during urination. It must have survived in some nook. Cue another several months of desperate attempts to clear it: doctors, antibiotics, tests.\n\nAfter **two times** of several courses, we are now finally clear again. I tested negative two times in a row 6 months apart, the last time using the online test I mentioned.\n\nThe US has a lot of things inferior to other countries and STD testing is one of them. US \"clean\" is not clean. A US \"full\" STD panel is not full. And if you try to teach potential partners about this and get them properly tested, good luck. You can give them $300 test kits, they agree to use them and then throw them away.",

Its kind of like testing for African Sleeping Sickness.

I had to answer questions about exposure in a certain way, fishing for Trich to be included.\n\n> there is a reasonable argument to be made that its a waste of time and resources to test for things that have extremely low prevalence in the US population\n\nBut the prevalence of these things is not low. Trichomoniasis causes an awful fishy smell of the genitals, increases risk of other infections, and some [3.7 million](https://www.cdc.gov/std/trichomonas/STDFact-Trichomoniasis.htm) in the US have it. For ureaplasma and mycoplasma I don't know the prevalence, but they are likely at least as common as chlamydia.\n\nPeople who are non-monogamous or serially monogamous should be tested for these. US tests seem to be really geared toward long-term monogamous people who want to get tested once and then have the same partner for 5 years. They're not meant to protect the promiscuous - they protect the monogamous *from* the promiscuous.",

I understand it's not a big deal for 2/3 of its carriers. But it is a big deal for 1/3 and it has serious implications in childbirth. Given that testing and antivirals are one of our few weapons against it, it seems to me we should use them to avoid transmission.

That's not a reason to not wear helmets and body armor.\n\nPeople in the medical profession seem to be either some of the most paranoid or some of the most reckless. I've met doctors who smoke heavily despite knowing everything about it, who drink heavily or abuse prescription drugs despite knowing all of the consequences, etc.\n\nI'll take a negative result for HSV-2 over a positive one. I understand the tests have limitations, but I'll do it for the same reasons a motorcyclist might wear a helmet.\n\nI also think you're overestimating the impact of \"anxiety\". For people in monogamous relationships, the relationship is more important than HSV-2. But for people with varied sex lives involving casual partners - whether consecutively or at the same time - HSV-2 matters.",

I'll save you the math - that's a more than 99% cure rate.\n\nAnd here are some [statistics for the US](https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/data-and-trends/statistics) specifically showing that the rate of new HIV infections dropped 8% between 2010 and 2015.",

You take four pills, abstain from sex for a week, and a week later you are cured.  Not just treated but CURED.  In 2 months you will test STD free again.  (before two months there are still dead bacteria so those will show up as a postive result).\n\nSecond, that's 2.3 million cases out of how many millions of people having sex per year?  I can tell you the risk is mostly overblown.  Minus the 1.7 million Chlamydia  and you have 600k people infected with something other than chlamydia per year.  600k out of how many millions are having sex?  There are 310 million people in the USA per 2010 census.\n\nThe risk is not zero, it can be acceptable for some by asking for exclusivity, getting regular testing, etc.",

I'm ok either way and they are in the drawer on her side of the bed.  I'm not married and do not feel the need for additional sexual partners beyond my SB.  Yes I realize she may have some age appropriate sexual partners and that's potentially an additional risk factor for me.  I mention this only as a data point and NOT to try to convince anyone to change what makes them comfortable. Great sugar relationships are based on finding compatible expectations and activities.  There are other risk factors that are not negotiable for me. ",

We are talking 55 year old successful businessmen who have years of experience in negotiation vs 21 year old girls with no life experience who need the money and who have been raised to be polite and charming. Add in the fact that they chose to be SBs because they don't want the prostitute label, but bringing up money \"too early\" often leads to some very hurtful and vindictive accusations. In a playing field like this, there has to be some more moral responsibility on the SD's part.\n\nLastly, it's very evident to me that the SDs who do this have done it a million times with the *clear* intention of manipulating naive girls into doing something the SD knows they aren't comfortable with.

I had to answer questions about exposure in a certain way, fishing for Trich to be included.\n\n> there is a reasonable argument to be made that its a waste of time and resources to test for things that have extremely low prevalence in the US population\n\nBut the prevalence of these things is not low. Trichomoniasis causes an awful fishy smell of the genitals, increases risk of other infections, and some [3.7 million](https://www.cdc.gov/std/trichomonas/STDFact-Trichomoniasis.htm) in the US have it. For ureaplasma and mycoplasma I don't know the prevalence, but they are likely at least as common as chlamydia.\n\nPeople who are non-monogamous or serially monogamous should be tested for these. US tests seem to be really geared toward long-term monogamous people who want to get tested once and then have the same partner for 5 years. They're not meant to protect the promiscuous - they protect the monogamous *from* the promiscuous.",

I understand it's not a big deal for 2/3 of its carriers. But it is a big deal for 1/3 and it has serious implications in childbirth. Given that testing and antivirals are one of our few weapons against it, it seems to me we should use them to avoid transmission.

Yes I realize she may have some age appropriate sexual partners and that's potentially an additional risk factor for me.

I'm in my early/mid 50s.\n\nCertainly as a teenager and in my very early 20s no one considered ever using a condom and, of course, contraception (or \"birth control\" as I think Americans call it) is free in this country.\n\nThe first big TV campaigns around AIDS awareness came out in this country when I was 22 and I think there was quite a big shift in attitudes back then.  It was certainly only after that time that I used a condom for the first ever time.\n\nI remember a couple of years ago talking to some people who are about 5 to 10 years younger than I am.  So, they're right in the middle of Gen X and were still in school when the AIDS campaigns were airing and it was being discussed in school.

We are talking 55 year old successful businessmen who have years of experience in negotiation vs 21 year old girls with no life experience who need the money and who have been raised to be polite and charming. Add in the fact that they chose to be SBs because they don't want the prostitute label, but bringing up money \"too early\" often leads to some very hurtful and vindictive accusations. In a playing field like this, there has to be some more moral responsibility on the SD's part.\n\nLastly, it's very evident to me that the SDs who do this have done it a million times with the *clear* intention of manipulating naive girls into doing something the SD knows they aren't comfortable with.

Trichomoniasis causes an awful fishy smell of the genitals, increases risk of other infections, and some [3.7 million](https://www.cdc.gov/std/trichomonas/STDFact-Trichomoniasis.htm) in the US have it. For ureaplasma and mycoplasma I don't know the prevalence, but they are likely at least as common as chlamydia.\n\nPeople who are non-monogamous or serially monogamous should be tested for these. US tests seem to be really geared toward long-term monogamous people who want to get tested once and then have the same partner for 5 years. They're not meant to protect the promiscuous - they protect the monogamous *from* the promiscuous.",

I understand it's not a big deal for 2/3 of its carriers. But it is a big deal for 1/3 and it has serious implications in childbirth. Given that testing and antivirals are one of our few weapons against it, it seems to me we should use them to avoid transmission.

I would be called either one of the very last boomers or one of the very first of Gen X (depending where exactly you put the cut-off date).  I'm in my early/mid 50s.\n\nCertainly as a teenager and in my very early 20s no one considered ever using a condom and, of course, contraception (or \"birth control\" as I think Americans call it) is free in this country.\n\nThe first big TV campaigns around AIDS awareness came out in this country when I was 22 and I think there was quite a big shift in attitudes back then.  It was certainly only after that time that I used a condom for the first ever time.\n\nI remember a couple of years ago talking to some people who are about 5 to 10 years younger than I am.  So, they're right in the middle of Gen X and were still in school when the AIDS campaigns were airing and it was being discussed in school.  Without exception, they all mentioned how big an effect that had on them, very much like you said, they:-\n\n>came of age in such an atmosphere of fear that condoms weren't even a question, they were a potentially life saving certainty.\n\n\n\n",

I'm in my early/mid 50s.\n\nCertainly as a teenager and in my very early 20s no one considered ever using a condom and, of course, contraception (or \"birth control\" as I think Americans call it) is free in this country.\n\nThe first big TV campaigns around AIDS awareness came out in this country when I was 22 and I think there was quite a big shift in attitudes back then.  It was certainly only after that time that I used a condom for the first ever time.\n\nI remember a couple of years ago talking to some people who are about 5 to 10 years younger than I am.  So, they're right in the middle of Gen X and were still in school when the AIDS campaigns were airing and it was being discussed in school.  Without exception, they all mentioned how big an effect that had on them, very much like you said, they:-\n\n>came of age in such an atmosphere of fear that condoms weren't even a question, they were a potentially life saving certainty.\n\n\n\n",

You're saying this is rare, but statistics show its prevalence is high, it just might not always create problems. I'm also confused by your easy-going view of HSV-2. I understand it's not a big deal for 2/3 of its carriers. But it is a big deal for 1/3 and it has serious implications in childbirth. Given that testing and antivirals are one of our few weapons against it, it seems to me we should use them to avoid transmission. Sure, some NN% of people have it, but it's too easy to say it's no big deal when it's just other people who are suffering symptoms.",

From [Neonatal Herpes Simplex Virus Infections](https://www.aafp.org/afp/2002/0315/p1138.html):\n\n> Neonatal herpes simplex virus infections can result in serious morbidity and mortality. [...]\n\n> Of known infected infants, only 30 percent have mothers who had symptomatic HSV or a sexual partner with clinical infection. Many neonatal infections occur because of asymptomatic cervical shedding of virus, usually after a primary episode of HSV infection. [...]\n\n> Primary genital HSV infections during pregnancy occur at rates similar to those in nonpregnant women, and often these infections are asymptomatic.\n\nIf someone has told you to never mind HSV-2 unless you experience symptoms, consider if they're telling you that because they are themselves HSV-2 positive and want to downplay the risk to their partners.\n\nThis advice you received seems self-serving.",

I understand the tests have limitations, but I'll do it for the same reasons a motorcyclist might wear a helmet.\n\nI also think you're overestimating the impact of \"anxiety\".
