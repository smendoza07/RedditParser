It doesn't have to be a buzzcut or short, just groomed.  For me, I wouldn't think twice about the haircut you have and would hire you with it, but then I work in software and earlier this year hired a dude with a pink and purple mowhawk.  Most biz dudes are more conservative then me and i think making the top a consistent length is the minimum you need.",

I fade my sides and have a flat top kind of thing going on top, but then I use one of those new curl sponges and I have like I pretty dope finish.\n\nI had to experiment with a lot of products due to my hair being dry and the curls coming out like dread locks. I use some olive oil type shit daily (don't know the name of the product and not home to take a pic). I also use a curling souffle which together add nice moisture.\n\nDefinitely experiment man we do have a lot of options, they just take a little more work.",

It doesn't have to be a buzzcut or short, just groomed.  For me, I wouldn't think twice about the haircut you have and would hire you with it, but then I work in software and earlier this year hired a dude with a pink and purple mowhawk.  Most biz dudes are more conservative then me and i think making the top a consistent length is the minimum you need.",
