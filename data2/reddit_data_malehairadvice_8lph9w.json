Regular trims are the only way to prevent it. By regular, we generally recommend every 6-8 weeks but you can stretch it depending on the health of your hair. I wouldn\u2019t go longer than three months. Because you haven\u2019t been getting regular trims I would get on a regular schedule of 6-8 weeks like clock work and over the next year, stretch it out and go by feel. By feel I mean when it starts to tangle more frequently and become more unruly, you need a trim. \n\nEdit: grammar",

The older and beat up the end of the string or rope is, the more frayed it becomes. If you want to thread that string through the eye of a needle, you have to cut it to get a nice fresh end to work with. Hair does the same thing. Different types of hair will do it at a different rate. I go by my rule of thumb because dead ends snag together like Velcro causing tangles. If you generally don\u2019t ever get tangled, ever, I would stick to some where between every 3 to 4 months to make sure you\u2019re getting them so they don\u2019t get bad. \n\nLet\u2019s talk about the humidity. That could have a lot of causes. Usually the number one cause is it could be dry from over washing. If you\u2019re washing everyday with a really drying product, leaving your hair starving for moisture then walk out in to the Texas humidity, your hair reacts and is drawing in the moisture from the air and it\u2019s not good moisture. What\u2019s your routine? What are you washing and styling with? Have you have any chemical treatments done to your hair like color, perms, or relaxer? Would you have a budget to incorporate new products? ",

Long hair on top, buzzed short on sides and back. Currently worn with the top combed to one side.\n\nKeep in mind that most Barber terms are not universal.

A barber long ago gave me a disconnected cut on the side but went way too far up on the right side, and then gave me a combover pushing all the hair on the top to the left. Now it looks like there's a lot of hair on the left side of my head and no hair on the right side of my head. I thought it was just a bad barber but I went to 3 other barbers, trying to specifically tell them to balance it out because I don't want it lopsided-disconnected, but they don't ever do it right and tend to follow the disconnection every damn time.\n\nQuestion: How do you fix a bad disconnected haircut? Do you just buzz it all and start over? What do you suggest? I can PM you pics if you'd like\n\nEdit: it kinda looks [like this](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KvCtzxpH6EM/maxresdefault.jpg) but much more on the left side and much less on the right side (my head is also much rounder than his)",

If you\u2019ve had it lopsided for a while, your hair is trained to fall like that so the barber follows suit. \n\nThere\u2019s only two ways to fix this. Grow it out kinda long and have the barber cut it like that. If you ask for a slick back or something like that, they tend to even it out, especially with longer hair. Or buzz it and start over. ",

Because you haven\u2019t been getting regular trims I would get on a regular schedule of 6-8 weeks like clock work and over the next year, stretch it out and go by feel. By feel I mean when it starts to tangle more frequently and become more unruly, you need a trim. \n\nEdit: grammar",

The older and beat up the end of the string or rope is, the more frayed it becomes. If you want to thread that string through the eye of a needle, you have to cut it to get a nice fresh end to work with. Hair does the same thing. Different types of hair will do it at a different rate. I go by my rule of thumb because dead ends snag together like Velcro causing tangles. If you generally don\u2019t ever get tangled, ever, I would stick to some where between every 3 to 4 months to make sure you\u2019re getting them so they don\u2019t get bad. \n\nLet\u2019s talk about the humidity. That could have a lot of causes. Usually the number one cause is it could be dry from over washing. If you\u2019re washing everyday with a really drying product, leaving your hair starving for moisture then walk out in to the Texas humidity, your hair reacts and is drawing in the moisture from the air and it\u2019s not good moisture. What\u2019s your routine? What are you washing and styling with? Have you have any chemical treatments done to your hair like color, perms, or relaxer? Would you have a budget to incorporate new products? ",

That could have a lot of causes. Usually the number one cause is it could be dry from over washing. If you\u2019re washing everyday with a really drying product, leaving your hair starving for moisture then walk out in to the Texas humidity, your hair reacts and is drawing in the moisture from the air and it\u2019s not good moisture. What\u2019s your routine? What are you washing and styling with? Have you have any chemical treatments done to your hair like color, perms, or relaxer? Would you have a budget to incorporate new products? ",

It\u2019s good for when people don\u2019t want to look like they just got a haircut and make the style looked loved in. Razor cutting is more of a high end technique because it is really easy to cut too much at a time. ",

Grooming creams seem to work well with your type of hair, they give nice healthy shine and a mild amount of hold so that you can keep pushing it around throughout the day. Try raking the product through with your finger tips from the front to the back and twisting a couple pieces here and there to add more texture.",
