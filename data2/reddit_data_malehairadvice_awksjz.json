            "body": "This is my current collection. I like taking care of my hair and this sub helped me a lot (among other YouTube videos).\n\nI'll try to write a little review for each one of them.\n\nMy hair is thick, around 4 inches in front 2.5 on the back. I do the nopoo no conditioner method (I shampoo and condition my hair every sunday)\n\nMy main style is faded undercut, and I style it in quiffs, pompadours or slick back.\n\nAbout the products, first from left to right:\n\n1.-John Frieda Beach blonde sea salt water (I'm not blonde) it's a pretty good product to get texture on my hair, the smell is nice but it doesn't have much hold power, pretty cheap tho.\n\n2.-Blumaan original meraki: it\u00b4s a good prestyler (I always use it as a prestyler) it has good hold power but for my hair thickness and length I need to couple it with other products on this list.\n\n3.- Suavecito matte pomade: the first thin I want to say about this one is that it has a pretty good masculine smell, I've received compliments from other girls when wearing it. It has a nice matte finishing kinda like a clay but it's a water based pomade, it has strong hold, great for pomps.\n\n4.-Reuzel blue: it's a water based pomade, it has a pretty nice and sweet tobbaco smell, that lasts for a while when you apply it, it has a great hold, medium shine and it can last for all day with a small product application, ideal for slick back hairstyles with or without volume (think the infamous Brad Pitt fury hairstyle or the hairstyle Zack Effron wore on baywatch).\n\n5.-Hanz de fuko Claymation: one of the best clays in the market, it doesn't have any smell, but the texture you get is marvelous, easy to apply too.\n\n6.-You can't see it but below claymation is Quicksand: At first I didn't like it because it leaved my hair with a messy feeling, and without structure, but after experimenting a lot with my hair dryer and different products I nailed it. You got to apply it evenly on your dry hair and from there give it structure with your hand and fingers, rework after a few minutes and then the product sets itself.\n\n7.- The cotton like color bottle you see back there its called sugar rush, it's from a sephora wannabe called sally beauty, but what I liked about this is that it's a sugar spray that works similar to sea salt spray but it's less harsh on your hair, smells like candy too, great for messy hayrstiles coupled with a good wax.\n\n8.- Baracuda water based pomade - it's from Guadalajara Mexico but it's a great water based pomade, with medium shine and high hold, it's pretty expensive too! around 3 bucks.\n\n9.-Reuzel Green - oil based pomade, it has a good smell, kinda citrusy I need to apply a little bit more of product when I use it If I want it to hold my style all day, not much tho. I use it on formal ocasions with a good quiff or slicked back.\n\n10.- Back there is not your mother's sea salt spray: it's often recommended in here and I can see why, it has a pretty good hold even when used it alone, it smells pretty good and has good quantity for the price too.\n\n11.-Marula Oil: I told you that I use the nopoo method but  every day before taking a shower I comb my hair with a boar bristle  brush, and then I apply a few drops of this oil on my hair after shower.\n\n12.- Reuzel grooming tonic: it's a tonic that features heat protection and gives good volume to my hair, it smells like an old cologne and has good hold on its own, I use it when I don't want to use bluuman original meraki, both are great.\n\n13.- Cavalier by blumaan: it's a hard clay gives great texture to my hair, but the only draw back is that even after emulsifing it it's pretty hard to apply on my hair, I always end with individual hairs on my hand, has great duration too, sometimes too much imo. I prefer HDF claymation.\n\n14.- The last product I bought,  layrite super hold pomade, it's water based has great hold that lasts all day and what I loved more from this one was its smell, it's kinda like a soda, smells great and lasts all day! Seriously yesterday when I was preparing to sleep I could still smell it, maybe if you don't like the smeel this'll be a drawback.\n\nAnd that's all, I wanted to share it with you, if you have any more questions I'll answer them gladly.\n",

Have you experienced any negative effects from not washing it out?",

Pretty easy.\n\nIf you got more questions feel free to ask! This is why I posted and I'm glad to help.\n\n",
