    "body": "Being a veteran SB in the sugar dating community (on and off for the last 9 years), I get a lot of DMs asking me various questions, ranging from Can you help with my question on xyz to Let's meet because I really want to take you to Paris and then Bali when covid is over (okay, I've not gotten the latter DM, yet).\n\nOne of the prevalent questions is money, and everything around it. NOTE, I am in the US, and this knowledge is US-centric. Apps and methods may be different for you if you're outside of the US. (Also note, I'm not perfect, and may be wrong in some of my assertions, do chime in with *verifiable links* if you find an inaccuracy)\n\n# On transferring/receiving\n\n\\- **CHC. Cold Hard Cash is the best IMO.** No traceability. Not reversible or disputable compared to digital transferring.\n\n**- Digital payment methods**: Some people want to stick with cash all the time. In other SRs, as you gain trust between each other, digital payment makes things so much easier. There's PayPal, Venmo, CashApp, Apple Pay / Google Pay, Zelle, and wire transfer. *And, who doesn't like to send/receive a surprise gift once in a while! Easily done via digital platforms!*\n\nI personally have received Benjis in all 6 of these digital platforms from long term SDs. I go with whatever format each individual SD is comfortable using.\n\nWorth noting, there's a daily/weekly/monthly limit on the SENDER'S end, depending on the platform (PayPal limit is 10k per transaction, Venmo it's 5k per week, etc). As far as I know, there's no limit on the receiver's end on how much can be received (I noted some SBs have multiple SDs at a time).\n\nAs with all things, use your common sense. Don't be a schmuck and put the note/message as anything resembling something fishy or odd. One of my SDs play up the note/message with funny things like \"thanks for fixing my kitchen\"\n\nMost importantly, DO NOT SHARE YOUR LOGIN ID OR PASSWORD WITH ANYONE for any of your digital payment accounts or bank accounts. It may seem like a silly and redundant reminder to a lot of people, but the more naive and lurking ones needs to read and understand this to avoid scams. (Also, read the scam-sticky post on this forum)\n\n1. **PayPal.** As an SB, I would NOT recommend accepting funds via PayPal until you've established a lot of trust with someone, as it's often touted as not \"sex work\" friendly (sugar dating is not SW, but the lines are blurred even in the sugar community itself, but especially so in the eyes of general society). It should be sent as \"friends/family\" and there should not be a fee deducted by the platform. Two of my (previous) SDs preferred using this method. Make sure they don't put any weird notes/messages when they send it via PayPal. Use ambiguous language. One thing to note is, I also use this PayPal account as payment when shopping online. Some sites accept PayPal payment. So there's incoming and outgoing money. I've had this account for years and use an Alias name for anonymity. I'm not sure if new accounts can have Alias names or not.\n2. **Venmo**. It's owned by PayPal. You can only have ONE Venmo account. I would suggest using your burner number to sign up, and if you've already signed up with your real phone number, that's fine, just change/update your Venmo name ID to reflect some anonymity. It can be changed after the fact. DO NOT allow Venmo to access your \"Contact list\" and DO NOT have any Friends on your Friends List. The last thing you'd want is have some (disgruntled) man contact your friends/families...!\n3. **CashApp.** Owned by Square. Your outward-name and cashtag can be anonymous. Set it that way. If I recall, Square does require you to verify your real name and ID - your sender will not be able to see that info.\n4. **Apple Pay/Google Pay** Sent via an iPhone number. (I don't know much about google pay, I assume it's very similar?)\n5. **Zelle.** Sender will need an email or phone number to send it to. I \\*think\\* the sender will see the receiver's name once it's accepted/linked to the receivers bank. I'm not 100% certain.\n6. **Wire Transfer.** Sender will need the receiver's full name, as well as the bank routing, account number, and address on the bank account. This last one requires a hell lot of trust on the receivers' end. Do not use this lightly or with someone you hardly know or new.\n\n# On saving/spending\n\n* Spend your cash in person in whatever you can, groceries/gas, doctor's office visits, etc. And then just deposit/invest the rest as you get them.\n* With these digital payment formats, you can request PayPal / Venmo / CashApp to mail you a physical debit card. I believe PayPal's is also a credit card whereas the other two are just debit cards.\n* At times, I use cash to buy gift cards at the grocery store and then transfer those gift cards into my online shopping accounts. Amazon is a great one for that since I do a lot of shopping on amazon. Or whatever other site you use often. There's also the option of buying a prepaid Visa card but that has a fee to it, so being the mindful spender that I am, I choose options that don't require fees.\n\n# On Taxes\n\n**Sugar dating allowance and presents are gifts and are not taxable, regardless of amount received per time or per year. SBs do not pay taxes on the gifts or need to include in in their income tax return.**\n\nPlease note, this is only applicable in the US (I do not know tax laws and regulations in other countries, esp ones where SW is legalized)\n\nLots of people on here like to argue about this point, but after much research and reading, this is what I've found. SBs, do feel free to pay taxes on the gifts if that's what you want to do.\n\nHere's the down low.\n\n* It is illegal to ***structure your deposits*** to avoid the \"reporting\" or \"flagging\" by your bank. It is not illegal to deposit cash gifts. And receiving cash gifts is not illegal, in any amount.\n* The gift giver/SD \\*should\\* report it on his/her tax return if the amount given to any one specific individual exceeds 15k per calendar year. Anything under that, he's not obligated to. And, many SDs don't report it even if it's over the 15k mark - it is 100% the SDs' duty and it's up to him.\n* SDs do not have to pay taxes on it. He just has to REPORT it / write it on his tax return. All he needs is SB's full name.\n* Gift givers do not pay taxes until he/she has reached a lifetime gifting amount of **11.7 MILLION USD (for year 2021).** Any amount AFTER that would be taxable. That's right. You are not obligated or bound to pay any taxes on gift giving until that amount has been reached.\n\nLastly, I've done extensive research and I have zero intention to argue with anyone re the tax section. All comments disputing that part will be ignored. *I am not a tax advisor. Nor licensed.\ud83d\ude44Take all things you read online with a grain of salt.*\n\nMay the sugar gods be generous to those who are generous. Have fun!",

All the countries I've been dealing with within EU charge gift tax even for ridiculously small monetary amounts, and in all countries the person subject to tax is the receiver.. You can play around it of course if you know what you're doing, but the principal rule is that you as a receiver need to report and pay taxes on any gifts received. The chances of running into problems is quite minimal even if depositing or receiving bank transfers, but there is a risk, so either know your local rules, or go with cash never deposited into your acc.",

What you refer is only due to inheritance tax when the gifter dies  If tax is due it comes from the estate not the individual.   There is a small risk that if the person dies and there is no money left in the estate then a gift can be clawed back but this is only likely for very large sums and the amount tapers over the 7years. \n\nIn any case, gifts made out of excess income (income above what the gifter needs for day to day living) are exempt from even inheritance tax.  \n\nSo in the context of a person giving money in a relationship, unless it was a large sum that was not excess income and the person dies soon afterwards, it is completely free of all taxes.  \n\nIn pretty well most cases gifts like sugar are from excess income and therefore exempt from inheritance tax.    \n\nAnyone getting money from me in the uk will never ever need to pay tax of any type.",

You have that funny rule of surplus income being ok to give away tax-free.\n\nBut then, I think for example Ireland limits tax-free gifts to something like 15-20k lifetime, no matter who is the gifter. Germany has also limit of 20k, though I think it's only for 10yrs and per gifter. Sweden does not have gift tax at all nowadays, Finland limits to 5k during 3 years per gifter, Spain and France have nothing tax-free, taxing starts basically from 0.\n\nThe point is that you need to know your local rules. Still haven't seen a country in Europe which would tax the payer like in US. In all countries it is the receiver who pays taxes, and it is important for European SBs to understand that. We mostly have no problem giving out our bank details, which seems to be huge red in the States. However, depending on your country, you might not want money arriving to your bank acc, because it will be noted and you will end up paying taxes.",

I do transfers as well, but it's really a special case. Haven't gotten into problems so far, even though they are in USD.. There would jump in the international agreements between countries. Because he is liable to tax as US gifter, in theory the obligation should not be duplicated at my end. I also have him as a resident in my address (signed in notary for his permanent visa), so I could claim it's not a gift, he's only paying his part of the running costs as my life-partner, which would easily be supported by the fact that he always transfers me money 2 days before my rent is due.\n\nI think in all countries, gifts are supposed to be voluntarily reported by the receiver, which obviously never happens for smaller amounts. In reality, you are not going to be checked by anyone as long as one-time transfers are not too big. But well, the risk is there, and really depends on the country.\n\nI'm accountant, so I know my risks and anything I do, I know I will be fully responsible if \"getting caught\". There are things I do voluntarily report, like my tiny capital gains. Fingers crossed it's enough to keep tax office happy in future too :D",

I don't think his legal position is necessarily correct (except on the OnlyFans part, which is definitely taxable).\n\nThe problem with that CPA's logic is: where is the line drawn? For example, what about a plain vanilla GF, who a guy showers with cash and gifts, to the tune of a thousand Benjamins per year? Every time he stops giving her gifts, she stops putting out. When the gifts re-start, she is back in bed with him. \n\nLike you said, we have to go with substance over form, and in that 'vanilla' scenario I described, the substance related to the quid pro quo is not materially different than an \"official\" SD/SB relationship that started on SA.\n\nI am going to look for US tax court case law. I am sure there are cases from the past, where the IRS found a 7 figure bank account that a rich guy's girlfriend had, and they tried to tax it. The outcomes from those types of cases will tell the real story on taxability, as the line has to be drawn somewhere. \n\nThat CPA's website should be talking about that type of case law, to support his argument, but he doesn't. Sugaring has been around for 5,000 years, so I don't think a SD/SB who found each other on SA, are in some new territory, in terms of taxability.",

Is it really worth it for a SB to pay (including FICA) approx 35% taxes, to avoid an adverse outcome from an audit, which has about a 1% annual chance of happening? \n\nMaybe, maybe not. If we're talking big $ for a SB, I would take a close look at the case law on gifts, quid pro quo, and the various factors that determine gifts versus \"compensation\", in various types of payment scenarios. I'm not convinced that it's as black-and-white as that CPA makes it out to be.\n\nAnd then, depending on what the case law shows, if the SB can make a good faith argument that the gift $ are non-taxable, the SB should disclose all bank account data to a tax lawyer, and have that lawyer prepare the return and sign-off on it.",

So yes it does get taxed, just not now.\n\nAlso, a gift over 15 k has to be reported on the gift tax form and requires the SB\u2019s name and social security number. If the SD\u2019s wife is happy to gift share, the limit becomes 30 k. Trust me, I\u2019ve been filing gift tax returns for years, so I\u2019m quite familiar with how the process works.",

No, not even close. But, not a risk you want to take.\n\nWhen I win money at sports betting, I get paid in cash from the casino, 5 figures worth typically, and I report it on my taxes. But, I NEVER would deposit that into the bank. I use it for normal daily living expenses.",

Any curious readers can go back in posting histories to get the recap.\n\nInstead, I will just comment - best advice is for an SB to use cash received to the greatest extent practical, and if there is still more cash (like in a particularly heavy monthly allowance or PPM situation) they need to weigh the risk of keeping so much cash on hand, vs. depositing it in the bank for peace of mind, recognizing that there is a (minute) threat of asset forfeiture.",

However, I gave her money for the downpayment of her car and I told her that would be her Valentine\u2019s Day and birthday gift; that is legally a gift because I don\u2019t expect anything tangible in return.\n\nI think most arrangements are structured as payment in return for something.

He's happy when she's happy. If a wealthy man shared nothing, most people would think that out of the norm and call him a cheapskate. I would say it's somewhat a societal expectation. OTOH, if you are PPMing and get 2 hours of sex and do nothing else, there may be an argument for pay for service. But there's no market value on a date to a hookah bar, or going out to dinner, or a museum... when ppm is given whether intimate or not - vs pps. But even pps is arguably OK since there's 'fuck buddies' and fwb's who hook up and never go on dates. Last I checked there's no published price chart for having a girlfriend.",

I have always saved cash that I receive (from family, selling things on Craigslist) and occasionally have deposited it when it\u2019s needed, but mostly I just keep it on hand. I want to keep doing this, but I will also need to deposit some of my sugar money for bills.

Sweden does not have gift tax at all nowadays, Finland limits to 5k during 3 years per gifter, Spain and France have nothing tax-free, taxing starts basically from 0.\n\nThe point is that you need to know your local rules. Still haven't seen a country in Europe which would tax the payer like in US. In all countries it is the receiver who pays taxes, and it is important for European SBs to understand that. We mostly have no problem giving out our bank details, which seems to be huge red in the States.

Because he is liable to tax as US gifter, in theory the obligation should not be duplicated at my end. I also have him as a resident in my address (signed in notary for his permanent visa), so I could claim it's not a gift, he's only paying his part of the running costs as my life-partner, which would easily be supported by the fact that he always transfers me money 2 days before my rent is due.\n\nI think in all countries, gifts are supposed to be voluntarily reported by the receiver, which obviously never happens for smaller amounts. In reality, you are not going to be checked by anyone as long as one-time transfers are not too big. But well, the risk is there, and really depends on the country.\n\nI'm accountant, so I know my risks and anything I do, I know I will be fully responsible if \"getting caught\".

I don't think his legal position is necessarily correct (except on the OnlyFans part, which is definitely taxable).\n\nThe problem with that CPA's logic is: where is the line drawn? For example, what about a plain vanilla GF, who a guy showers with cash and gifts, to the tune of a thousand Benjamins per year? Every time he stops giving her gifts, she stops putting out. When the gifts re-start, she is back in bed with him. \n\nLike you said, we have to go with substance over form, and in that 'vanilla' scenario I described, the substance related to the quid pro quo is not materially different than an \"official\" SD/SB relationship that started on SA.\n\nI am going to look for US tax court case law. I am sure there are cases from the past, where the IRS found a 7 figure bank account that a rich guy's girlfriend had, and they tried to tax it. The outcomes from those types of cases will tell the real story on taxability, as the line has to be drawn somewhere. \n\nThat CPA's website should be talking about that type of case law, to support his argument, but he doesn't. Sugaring has been around for 5,000 years, so I don't think a SD/SB who found each other on SA, are in some new territory, in terms of taxability.",

Is it really worth it for a SB to pay (including FICA) approx 35% taxes, to avoid an adverse outcome from an audit, which has about a 1% annual chance of happening? \n\nMaybe, maybe not. If we're talking big $ for a SB, I would take a close look at the case law on gifts, quid pro quo, and the various factors that determine gifts versus \"compensation\", in various types of payment scenarios. I'm not convinced that it's as black-and-white as that CPA makes it out to be.\n\nAnd then, depending on what the case law shows, if the SB can make a good faith argument that the gift $ are non-taxable, the SB should disclose all bank account data to a tax lawyer, and have that lawyer prepare the return and sign-off on it.",

In sugar dating, there is clear expectation when ppm or allowance is given.\n\nWith my current SB for example, I give her a monthly allowance for meeting 8 times a month. This is not a gift because I expect something from her in return. However, I gave her money for the downpayment of her car and I told her that would be her Valentine\u2019s Day and birthday gift; that is legally a gift because I don\u2019t expect anything tangible in return.\n\nI think most arrangements are structured as payment in return for something. I\u2019ve told my SBs that if the IRS were to ask me, I\u2019d say nothing myself (what idiot explains things to any government agent without a lawyer is beyond me), but my lawyer would say that I gave money for services rendered.

He's happy when she's happy. If a wealthy man shared nothing, most people would think that out of the norm and call him a cheapskate. I would say it's somewhat a societal expectation. OTOH, if you are PPMing and get 2 hours of sex and do nothing else, there may be an argument for pay for service. But there's no market value on a date to a hookah bar, or going out to dinner, or a museum... when ppm is given whether intimate or not - vs pps. But even pps is arguably OK since there's 'fuck buddies' and fwb's who hook up and never go on dates. Last I checked there's no published price chart for having a girlfriend.",

There is a small risk that if the person dies and there is no money left in the estate then a gift can be clawed back but this is only likely for very large sums and the amount tapers over the 7years. \n\nIn any case, gifts made out of excess income (income above what the gifter needs for day to day living) are exempt from even inheritance tax.  \n\nSo in the context of a person giving money in a relationship, unless it was a large sum that was not excess income and the person dies soon afterwards, it is completely free of all taxes.  \n\nIn pretty well most cases gifts like sugar are from excess income and therefore exempt from inheritance tax.    \n\nAnyone getting money from me in the uk will never ever need to pay tax of any type.",

You have that funny rule of surplus income being ok to give away tax-free.\n\nBut then, I think for example Ireland limits tax-free gifts to something like 15-20k lifetime, no matter who is the gifter. Germany has also limit of 20k, though I think it's only for 10yrs and per gifter. Sweden does not have gift tax at all nowadays, Finland limits to 5k during 3 years per gifter, Spain and France have nothing tax-free, taxing starts basically from 0.\n\nThe point is that you need to know your local rules. Still haven't seen a country in Europe which would tax the payer like in US. In all countries it is the receiver who pays taxes, and it is important for European SBs to understand that. We mostly have no problem giving out our bank details, which seems to be huge red in the States. However, depending on your country, you might not want money arriving to your bank acc, because it will be noted and you will end up paying taxes.",

Because he is liable to tax as US gifter, in theory the obligation should not be duplicated at my end. I also have him as a resident in my address (signed in notary for his permanent visa), so I could claim it's not a gift, he's only paying his part of the running costs as my life-partner, which would easily be supported by the fact that he always transfers me money 2 days before my rent is due.\n\nI think in all countries, gifts are supposed to be voluntarily reported by the receiver, which obviously never happens for smaller amounts. In reality, you are not going to be checked by anyone as long as one-time transfers are not too big. But well, the risk is there, and really depends on the country.\n\nI'm accountant, so I know my risks and anything I do, I know I will be fully responsible if \"getting caught\".

Is it really worth it for a SB to pay (including FICA) approx 35% taxes, to avoid an adverse outcome from an audit, which has about a 1% annual chance of happening? \n\nMaybe, maybe not. If we're talking big $ for a SB, I would take a close look at the case law on gifts, quid pro quo, and the various factors that determine gifts versus \"compensation\", in various types of payment scenarios. I'm not convinced that it's as black-and-white as that CPA makes it out to be.\n\nAnd then, depending on what the case law shows, if the SB can make a good faith argument that the gift $ are non-taxable, the SB should disclose all bank account data to a tax lawyer, and have that lawyer prepare the return and sign-off on it.",

He's happy when she's happy. If a wealthy man shared nothing, most people would think that out of the norm and call him a cheapskate. I would say it's somewhat a societal expectation. OTOH, if you are PPMing and get 2 hours of sex and do nothing else, there may be an argument for pay for service. But there's no market value on a date to a hookah bar, or going out to dinner, or a museum... when ppm is given whether intimate or not - vs pps. But even pps is arguably OK since there's 'fuck buddies' and fwb's who hook up and never go on dates. Last I checked there's no published price chart for having a girlfriend.",

What you refer is only due to inheritance tax when the gifter dies  If tax is due it comes from the estate not the individual.   There is a small risk that if the person dies and there is no money left in the estate then a gift can be clawed back but this is only likely for very large sums and the amount tapers over the 7years. \n\nIn any case, gifts made out of excess income (income above what the gifter needs for day to day living) are exempt from even inheritance tax.  \n\nSo in the context of a person giving money in a relationship, unless it was a large sum that was not excess income and the person dies soon afterwards, it is completely free of all taxes.  \n\nIn pretty well most cases gifts like sugar are from excess income and therefore exempt from inheritance tax.    \n\nAnyone getting money from me in the uk will never ever need to pay tax of any type.",

You have that funny rule of surplus income being ok to give away tax-free.\n\nBut then, I think for example Ireland limits tax-free gifts to something like 15-20k lifetime, no matter who is the gifter. Germany has also limit of 20k, though I think it's only for 10yrs and per gifter. Sweden does not have gift tax at all nowadays, Finland limits to 5k during 3 years per gifter, Spain and France have nothing tax-free, taxing starts basically from 0.\n\nThe point is that you need to know your local rules. Still haven't seen a country in Europe which would tax the payer like in US. In all countries it is the receiver who pays taxes, and it is important for European SBs to understand that. We mostly have no problem giving out our bank details, which seems to be huge red in the States.

In reality, you are not going to be checked by anyone as long as one-time transfers are not too big.

I'm not convinced that it's as black-and-white as that CPA makes it out to be.\n\nAnd then, depending on what the case law shows, if the SB can make a good faith argument that the gift $ are non-taxable, the SB should disclose all bank account data to a tax lawyer, and have that lawyer prepare the return and sign-off on it.",

OTOH, if you are PPMing and get 2 hours of sex and do nothing else, there may be an argument for pay for service. But there's no market value on a date to a hookah bar, or going out to dinner, or a museum... when ppm is given whether intimate or not - vs pps. But even pps is arguably OK since there's 'fuck buddies' and fwb's who hook up and never go on dates. Last I checked there's no published price chart for having a girlfriend.",

You have that funny rule of surplus income being ok to give away tax-free.\n\nBut then, I think for example Ireland limits tax-free gifts to something like 15-20k lifetime, no matter who is the gifter. Germany has also limit of 20k, though I think it's only for 10yrs and per gifter. Sweden does not have gift tax at all nowadays, Finland limits to 5k during 3 years per gifter, Spain and France have nothing tax-free, taxing starts basically from 0.\n\nThe point is that you need to know your local rules. Still haven't seen a country in Europe which would tax the payer like in US. In all countries it is the receiver who pays taxes, and it is important for European SBs to understand that. We mostly have no problem giving out our bank details, which seems to be huge red in the States. However, depending on your country, you might not want money arriving to your bank acc, because it will be noted and you will end up paying taxes.",

Because he is liable to tax as US gifter, in theory the obligation should not be duplicated at my end. I also have him as a resident in my address (signed in notary for his permanent visa), so I could claim it's not a gift, he's only paying his part of the running costs as my life-partner, which would easily be supported by the fact that he always transfers me money 2 days before my rent is due.\n\nI think in all countries, gifts are supposed to be voluntarily reported by the receiver, which obviously never happens for smaller amounts. In reality, you are not going to be checked by anyone as long as one-time transfers are not too big. But well, the risk is there, and really depends on the country.\n\nI'm accountant, so I know my risks and anything I do, I know I will be fully responsible if \"getting caught\".

If a wealthy man shared nothing, most people would think that out of the norm and call him a cheapskate. I would say it's somewhat a societal expectation. OTOH, if you are PPMing and get 2 hours of sex and do nothing else, there may be an argument for pay for service. But there's no market value on a date to a hookah bar, or going out to dinner, or a museum... when ppm is given whether intimate or not - vs pps. But even pps is arguably OK since there's 'fuck buddies' and fwb's who hook up and never go on dates. Last I checked there's no published price chart for having a girlfriend.",
