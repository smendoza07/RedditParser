That's part of why these newer shows have much higher production values. It's not just that more money went into them, it's that they aren't rushing to put out fifty episodes a year. \n\nI couldn't tell you why One Piece is different, except for maybe that it's a more prominent Jump property than Naruto was.",

That's part of why these newer shows have much higher production values. It's not just that more money went into them, it's that they aren't rushing to put out fifty episodes a year. \n\nI couldn't tell you why One Piece is different, except for maybe that it's a more prominent Jump property than Naruto was.",
