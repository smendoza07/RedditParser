Seeing some other person have a haircut with some features we like doesn\u2019t always help. Telling them what we like about a pictured hair style would be gold. Instead it\u2019s a bunch of gate keeping arm chair barbers yelling \u201cshort on the sides long on the top dur dur dur\u201d.  If all it took were the words long and short to describe a haircut we\u2019d all look perfect. ",

If it is a case of unreasonable expectations on the part of the customer, then the barber needs to communicate that.\nPart of being a barber, in fact the biggest part, is communication. It's also up to him to really understand what it is you want. Unfortunately, these days most barbers are scrubs that thought it would be a fun job and don't know what they are doing. They can do a mean fade, but it's usually the same one they give to everybody no matter what.\nDoing a men's regular should be the easiest thing in the world, especially if the instructions were clear. If the instructions were not clear on the customer's part, it's still  the barber's fault if the cut didn't come out right. A good barber knows not to start cutting until everybody is clear on how the cut will come out.",

Would actually provide substance for actual discussion. For a lot of these posts there\u2019s not really much more advise to give then the standard cookie cutter answer. Which to be fair, while unoriginal is still decent advise. \n\nEDIT: I\u2019ll also add that barber terms aren\u2019t really standardized across the industry. An Ivy League to one guy is a something entirely different to another. Pics help prevent misunderstanding in general ",

He is acting like its our fault that he cant find a barber to work with his hair.  and i simply put that he shows a picture or find a new barber.  he didnt like that answer and decided that he had the authority to tell me to unsubscribe just because he is mentally challenged.  All you need to do is watch what your barber is doing and correct him.  you start with a higher guardand work your way down.  its trial and error.  nothing we say will help him with his barber.  all barbers use different lingo.  a fade to one barber is the equivalent to a taper for another.  its his responsibility to manage his own head not ours.  we cant put words in his mouth so he can come back and blame everyone here for a bad hair cut.  plus, i never insulted his mom.  i just asked if his mom still wipes when he uses the bathroom.. lol",

The two things don\u2019t contradict each other but you seem to be saying that they do. I think he just phrased some things badly.\n\nTo focus on actually solving something though... Maybe what people should be doing is, instead of asking \u201chow can I get my barber to do this haircut?\u201d They should instead be specifying that they want to know some more ways to describe that particular cut to their barber, like \u201chow can I describe the fringe on this hairstyle?\u201d. This helps anything people could want; ability to google further images, ability to describe it to a barber, etc. Then that covers most posts here. \n",

If it is a case of unreasonable expectations on the part of the customer, then the barber needs to communicate that.\nPart of being a barber, in fact the biggest part, is communication. It's also up to him to really understand what it is you want. Unfortunately, these days most barbers are scrubs that thought it would be a fun job and don't know what they are doing. They can do a mean fade, but it's usually the same one they give to everybody no matter what.\nDoing a men's regular should be the easiest thing in the world, especially if the instructions were clear. If the instructions were not clear on the customer's part, it's still  the barber's fault if the cut didn't come out right.

Would actually provide substance for actual discussion. For a lot of these posts there\u2019s not really much more advise to give then the standard cookie cutter answer. Which to be fair, while unoriginal is still decent advise. \n\nEDIT: I\u2019ll also add that barber terms aren\u2019t really standardized across the industry. An Ivy League to one guy is a something entirely different to another. Pics help prevent misunderstanding in general ",

He is acting like its our fault that he cant find a barber to work with his hair.  and i simply put that he shows a picture or find a new barber.  he didnt like that answer and decided that he had the authority to tell me to unsubscribe just because he is mentally challenged.  All you need to do is watch what your barber is doing and correct him.  you start with a higher guardand work your way down.  its trial and error.  nothing we say will help him with his barber.  all barbers use different lingo.  a fade to one barber is the equivalent to a taper for another.  its his responsibility to manage his own head not ours.  we cant put words in his mouth so he can come back and blame everyone here for a bad hair cut.  plus, i never insulted his mom.  i just asked if his mom still wipes when he uses the bathroom.. lol",

The two things don\u2019t contradict each other but you seem to be saying that they do. I think he just phrased some things badly.\n\nTo focus on actually solving something though... Maybe what people should be doing is, instead of asking \u201chow can I get my barber to do this haircut?\u201d They should instead be specifying that they want to know some more ways to describe that particular cut to their barber, like \u201chow can I describe the fringe on this hairstyle?\u201d. This helps anything people could want; ability to google further images, ability to describe it to a barber, etc. Then that covers most posts here. \n",

It's also up to him to really understand what it is you want. Unfortunately, these days most barbers are scrubs that thought it would be a fun job and don't know what they are doing. They can do a mean fade, but it's usually the same one they give to everybody no matter what.\nDoing a men's regular should be the easiest thing in the world, especially if the instructions were clear. If the instructions were not clear on the customer's part, it's still  the barber's fault if the cut didn't come out right.

But you have the power of the internet as well as your words to explain what you want.  this guy is acting like its the end of the world if we dont tell him the name of a hair cut.  my point being a barber is going to understand you more if you show a picture vs if you tell him a dumb ass name for a hair cut.  He is acting like its our fault that he cant find a barber to work with his hair.  and i simply put that he shows a picture or find a new barber.  he didnt like that answer and decided that he had the authority to tell me to unsubscribe just because he is mentally challenged.  All you need to do is watch what your barber is doing and correct him.  you start with a higher guardand work your way down.  its trial and error.  nothing we say will help him with his barber.  all barbers use different lingo.  a fade to one barber is the equivalent to a taper for another.  its his responsibility to manage his own head not ours.  we cant put words in his mouth so he can come back and blame everyone here for a bad hair cut.  plus, i never insulted his mom.  i just asked if his mom still wipes when he uses the bathroom.. lol",

The two things don\u2019t contradict each other but you seem to be saying that they do. I think he just phrased some things badly.\n\nTo focus on actually solving something though... Maybe what people should be doing is, instead of asking \u201chow can I get my barber to do this haircut?\u201d They should instead be specifying that they want to know some more ways to describe that particular cut to their barber, like \u201chow can I describe the fringe on this hairstyle?\u201d. This helps anything people could want; ability to google further images, ability to describe it to a barber, etc. Then that covers most posts here. \n",

It's also up to him to really understand what it is you want. Unfortunately, these days most barbers are scrubs that thought it would be a fun job and don't know what they are doing. They can do a mean fade, but it's usually the same one they give to everybody no matter what.\nDoing a men's regular should be the easiest thing in the world, especially if the instructions were clear.

Maybe what people should be doing is, instead of asking \u201chow can I get my barber to do this haircut?\u201d They should instead be specifying that they want to know some more ways to describe that particular cut to their barber, like \u201chow can I describe the fringe on this hairstyle?\u201d. This helps anything people could want; ability to google further images, ability to describe it to a barber, etc. Then that covers most posts here. \n",

Maybe what people should be doing is, instead of asking \u201chow can I get my barber to do this haircut?\u201d They should instead be specifying that they want to know some more ways to describe that particular cut to their barber, like \u201chow can I describe the fringe on this hairstyle?\u201d. This helps anything people could want; ability to google further images, ability to describe it to a barber, etc. Then that covers most posts here. \n",

You should have a decent understanding of your face, head shape and what styles fit your head.  you show your barber the picture and the walk him through while he is cutting.  \"  no leave that side longer\"  \"can you fade the sides shorter\"  its all about communication.. seems like you just dont have a back bone to correct a barber when they mess your hair up.  Its perfectly normal to switch barbers.  i did that 5 times until i found the right one.  no one can do for you what you cant do yourself.  i will stay subscribed and i will continue to post.  go learn how to groom yourself.  i really hope you know how to bathe as well?  or does mom still do that for you too?
