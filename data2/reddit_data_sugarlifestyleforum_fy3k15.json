    "body": "And I\u2019m FANGIRLING. He is sooooo handsome! One picture is of him in his military uniform after a long day, and his body looks like a lean GI Jo character. Another is of him looking tough in a suit for his first managerial job \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\n\nNo wonder he has had threesomes and slept with 40+ women in his 20\u2019s. Jesus Christ what a man. \n\nI feel kind of bad, I don\u2019t think he would have dated me back then. I can only imagine how pretty his wife must have been.\n\nIt\u2019s really interesting seeing him with color in his hair, no belly and baby faced. 20 or 69 he has proved to be a handsome man.\n\nSorry I have no one to tell this to but the forum. Thanks for listening to my TedTalk.",

Still cute as hell.\n\nTry not to worry about whether he would\u2019ve dated you or not if he were in his 20s. I don\u2019t know if I would\u2019ve dated my sbf if we were the same age, he was a big partier then and I\u2019m not at all. You\u2019ve got each other now and if you\u2019re both happy, that\u2019s all that matters.",

Most sucked in bed.  Now after being with hundreds of women I have changed my taste completely over the years.  Now I like dark hair olive skinned girls with lean yoga bodies.  I love some not traditionally beautiful features found in Mediterranean women like larger noses.   One of my current SB\u2019s is a 21 year Persian girl that\u2019s 5\u201910 and thin, B cup with curly curly hair.  She said she looks like a used q tip and it made me sad.  I am beyond attracted to all of the traits that she hates (but will learn to love).  I totally devour her.  Her confidence is starting to build.  She exercises and her body is getting curves. \n\nLong story short... we can get exactly what we want now and he wants you.",

Most sucked in bed.  Now after being with hundreds of women I have changed my taste completely over the years.  Now I like dark hair olive skinned girls with lean yoga bodies.  I love some not traditionally beautiful features found in Mediterranean women like larger noses.   One of my current SB\u2019s is a 21 year Persian girl that\u2019s 5\u201910 and thin, B cup with curly curly hair.  She said she looks like a used q tip and it made me sad.  I am beyond attracted to all of the traits that she hates (but will learn to love).  I totally devour her.  Her confidence is starting to build.  She exercises and her body is getting curves. \n\nLong story short... we can get exactly what we want now and he wants you.",

Most sucked in bed.  Now after being with hundreds of women I have changed my taste completely over the years.  Now I like dark hair olive skinned girls with lean yoga bodies.  I love some not traditionally beautiful features found in Mediterranean women like larger noses.   One of my current SB\u2019s is a 21 year Persian girl that\u2019s 5\u201910 and thin, B cup with curly curly hair.  She said she looks like a used q tip and it made me sad.  I am beyond attracted to all of the traits that she hates (but will learn to love).  I totally devour her.  Her confidence is starting to build.  She exercises and her body is getting curves. \n\nLong story short... we can get exactly what we want now and he wants you.",

One of my ex SB\u2019s is a personal shopper for Nordstrom so I sent her over there to get started on a wardrobe.   OMG \ud83e\udd24\ud83e\udd24\ud83e\udd24\ud83e\udd24.  Maxi dresses and rompers and well fitted Zella/Lulu yoga outfits and coats.  Long tan cashmere coats with jeans and high boots.  She always turned heads but she though it was negative because she hated her height and hair.  Now she even admits she getting a crazy amount of attention.",
