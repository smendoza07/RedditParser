    "body": "The stress of the pandemic has taken over my man's life and work, along other things going on in his personal life that meant we haven't been able to see each other as often as I'd like the last few months. Last night we were talking and I told him I missed him terribly. \"I'll come by and say hello if you like. 20 minutes.\" he said. And in 20 minutes, there he was. He drove up the road in his shiny black GLA. I jumped in, squealed and hugged him as tight as I could. He had just finished a long Monday at the office but was as cheerful as ever to see me.\n\nWe spent the next hour driving around in the rain, music in the background, talking about our lives and exchanging banter. I was smiling so hard my cheeks hurt. All I did was stare at my handsome fine man as he talked, as he drove, as he smiled. I missed his smile. I wanted to take him all in. I missed him so much. \n\nWe stopped at a quiet parking lot and spent the remaining time staring at each other, laughing and just talking. I was happy to see him, he looked happy to see me and it made me even happier in the moment. He held his hand out and I intertwined my fingers with his. My mind and body was all over the place. I was excited and happy and shy and enchanted all at the same time. He brings out so many feelings in me. \n\nWe shared one too many kisses, to make up for the times we've been apart. He hugged me long and tight, kissed my cheeks and did it again and again. He wouldn't stop. He didn't let go. It was warm and sweet. \"I'm hugging you like I've missed you and I'll miss you.\u201d\n\nWe kissed and kissed and kissed into the night. Every time our lips were apart, he'd pull me back in. It was something he's always done, which I love. Our night was coming to an end. I opened the door of his car, took one last look at him, taking him all in, leaned in and gave him the biggest kiss on his lips and was off. It was a simple night spent but felt so intoxicatingly special. I'm still feeling the high \u2764\ufe0f",
