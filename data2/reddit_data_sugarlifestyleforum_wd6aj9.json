    "body": "Does anyone else experience this or just me? I constantly am dealing with SDs who have an interest in meeting me, we chat and things seem to be going great, then when we talk about meeting up, they immediately want sex, or an overnight stay. When I mention i\u2019m not comfortable with this, and would rather meet a few times before engaging in these activities (i\u2019m down for both, but comfort and chemistry needs to be established first) I get bashed or belittled. I just don\u2019t see why men feel so entitled sometimes. I understand the SD is the one paying, but since when did wanting to get to know someone\u2019s name in person first become a problem? Also staying overnight at a strangers house the first day we meet is just a given on why i\u2019m uncomfortable with that lol but men get so angry about it. The other thing that kind of ticks me is the men being so pushy, like when I say I do not like doing a certain sexual activity (anal to be exact) I get men saying \u201cwell if it\u2019s what i want you got to give it to me\u201d or \u201ci\u2019m not paying if you don\u2019t\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019ll like it with me don\u2019t worry\u201d\u2026\ni just feel that some SDs feel way too entitled, and do not understand that no means no? \n\n\n\nEDIT: some seem misinformed by my words, I am not saying intimacy HAS to wait until three dates, if the first meet is going well and we both want to head to the bedroom, i\u2019m all for it, but I hate when men message me \u201cwell if i\u2019m not getting pussy i\u2019m not paying\u201d when i\u2019ve never met them before so why would i just hand over pussy???\n\n\nEDIT x2: I can\u2019t believe i even have to do this but apparently men cannot read. NO WHERE DID I SAY I EXPECT PAYMENTS FOR NON INTIMATE MEETS. i said i received it in the past, NOT that i expect it. In this rant, ppm isn\u2019t even discussed, i\u2019m asked if i can meet that day, i say yes, and mention a local coffee shop and get hit with the \u201cwell i want sex\u201d or \u201cwell all i wanted was a bj\u201d texts.",

They are looking for a prostitutes and quick sex basically and you can tell because they won't care about your boundaries and they will ask you to do things like stay over at their house very soon. They will make you feel unsafe and uncomfortable. You have every right to get to know someone and make sure they aren't a killer before staying over at their house. Also, in my eyes even sugar relationships should have respect and class. Forcing someone into an ultimatum because they decide to not do a certain sexual activity is weird and not okay. Listen to how someone is making you feel. Trust your gut. If it's screaming that you feel disrespected and someone is pushing your boundaries run!",

The reason why men are flocking to these sugaring websites is because they know that the women on there know that they have to be on their A-Game when it comes to looks, conversation, sex, and just overall companionship. That\u2019s why there is a more curated selection of attractive women versus regular vanilla dating websites. And sex isn\u2019t the only thing that\u2019s expected from a sugar baby. You don\u2019t take an escort on a meet and greet because conversation isn\u2019t important in those transactions. It is strictly about sex. While sugaring is more of a GFE type of interaction, like a relationship without the commitment and with full transparency. But there\u2019s many different types of SRs that range on the spectrum of more transactional to more committed. Many SRs have ended up with marriage and many SDs and SBs fall in love. So I agree with the person that commented that you have a very black and white way of looking at sugaring.",

Next rest.\n\nNo overnight 1 to 3. No overnight until fully comfortable.\n\nAll details of arrangement agreed upon between 1 and 3.\n\nFlakiness, entitlement, overly sexual talk, next. \n\nBashing, degrading, boundaries disrespecting, super next/block.\n\nMature, appreciative gentlemen, that we can spoil in our way, that will then spoil us in their way.",

And if you're getting \"bashed or belittled\", that's verbal abuse by them.\n\nThere is a broader trend in society towards higher levels of narcissism and mental illness, along with low impulse control, and less ability to delay gratification. Other health metrics align with this also  e.g. lower dopamine, lower testosterone, lower sperm counts, higher autism rates, etc\n\nThe short version: more and more people are a-holes, abusive, emotional, whiny, etc. I've noticed it in the bowl, and in the business and (off-line) social world.",

Couple that with new SBs not being aware of this truism sets them up for frustrating and scary situations. \n\nBefore meeting you should probably discuss the plan. 1) M&G is platonic and unpaid,2) you ask for ( 1,2,or3) more unpaid, platonic dates to reach a level of comfort with a Pot, and 3) you are definitely interested in an intimate relationship with your SD,but have some boundaries that are worth discussing before getting together. \n\nSadly(some) guys can't seem to live without anal sex and you can let them go before wasting your time.

It is something my SD's have never had an issue with. On the first meet, if the vibe is right, I'm comfortable kissing, cuddling, hugging. I have a strict no sex on the first date rule, yet I haven't waited past 3 dates. I also don't meet with anyone I am not very attracted to and have turned down a lot of POTs because I knew the physical attraction just wasn't there. I don't believe paying for my time means that is WORTH more than any SD's. They are paying essentially for a relationship, an interaction that is tailored to their liking/schedule/needs (for the most part). I accommodate THEM as much as I can within my boundaries. All of the bells and whistles of a girlfriend without the \"negatives\". So yes, I ask for all in person meets to have PPM. It is, what it is.",

Especially when they have given you money to placate your ego that thinks your time is more valuable than theirs. That \u201cprepayment\u201d generates expectations. Since they have acquiesced to you, you now are expected to acquiesce to them. The clock is ticking. Quid pro quo.\n\nIf you desire to be better respected and don\u2019t want to have your boundaries pushed, try not acting like a prostitute where time is money. Instead, try being a woman who is looking to establish a rewarding relationship for all involved. As soon as you ask for platonic payment you shut out the men who know the honorable way to behave in the bowl and are left with what you are experiencing.\n\nEither lay in the bed you made or make the decision to change your sheets.",

Is he talking about paying for the date (in terms of dinner, drinks, etc) - or providing a PPM?\n\nIts very possible you sound like you are coming across as a rinser.

All she needed to do was make something clear such as PayPal and an up front payment- as for one other, there was just a coffee in town at lunch on work lunch breaks and no charge yet mutual interest in an arrangement continued for some time.",

The reason why men are flocking to these sugaring websites is because they know that the women on there know that they have to be on their A-Game when it comes to looks, conversation, sex, and just overall companionship. That\u2019s why there is a more curated selection of attractive women versus regular vanilla dating websites. And sex isn\u2019t the only thing that\u2019s expected from a sugar baby. You don\u2019t take an escort on a meet and greet because conversation isn\u2019t important in those transactions. It is strictly about sex. While sugaring is more of a GFE type of interaction, like a relationship without the commitment and with full transparency. But there\u2019s many different types of SRs that range on the spectrum of more transactional to more committed. Many SRs have ended up with marriage and many SDs and SBs fall in love. So I agree with the person that commented that you have a very black and white way of looking at sugaring.",

I've met amazing women there and had amazing interactions that were not about money at all. we were able to be open and honest with each other and connect authentically, in ways you can't do on Hinge, Tinder and Bumble because women on those sites are looking to settle down  and have vanilla relationships.\n\ni love that i can go to SA and have fun and meet open minded girls (who in THEIR words say they're NOT LOOKING FOR A RELATIONSHIP), so i dont have to jump through all the typical relationship hoops of tinder, bumble and hinge (coffee dates, yoga, hiking, farmers markets, yadda yadda).\n\nwe can have fun instead. although that's the point... a guy's idea of \"fun\" is often different from women's idea and that's where the money typically comes into play.",

The reason why men are flocking to these sugaring websites is because they know that the women on there know that they have to be on their A-Game when it comes to looks, conversation, sex, and just overall companionship. That\u2019s why there is a more curated selection of attractive women versus regular vanilla dating websites. And sex isn\u2019t the only thing that\u2019s expected from a sugar baby. You don\u2019t take an escort on a meet and greet because conversation isn\u2019t important in those transactions. It is strictly about sex. While sugaring is more of a GFE type of interaction, like a relationship without the commitment and with full transparency. But there\u2019s many different types of SRs that range on the spectrum of more transactional to more committed. Many SRs have ended up with marriage and many SDs and SBs fall in love. So I agree with the person that commented that you have a very black and white way of looking at sugaring.",

The reason why men are flocking to these sugaring websites is because they know that the women on there know that they have to be on their A-Game when it comes to looks, conversation, sex, and just overall companionship. That\u2019s why there is a more curated selection of attractive women versus regular vanilla dating websites. And sex isn\u2019t the only thing that\u2019s expected from a sugar baby. You don\u2019t take an escort on a meet and greet because conversation isn\u2019t important in those transactions. It is strictly about sex. While sugaring is more of a GFE type of interaction, like a relationship without the commitment and with full transparency. But there\u2019s many different types of SRs that range on the spectrum of more transactional to more committed. Many SRs have ended up with marriage and many SDs and SBs fall in love. So I agree with the person that commented that you have a very black and white way of looking at sugaring.",

I've met amazing women there and had amazing interactions that were not about money at all. we were able to be open and honest with each other and connect authentically, in ways you can't do on Hinge, Tinder and Bumble because women on those sites are looking to settle down  and have vanilla relationships.\n\ni love that i can go to SA and have fun and meet open minded girls (who in THEIR words say they're NOT LOOKING FOR A RELATIONSHIP), so i dont have to jump through all the typical relationship hoops of tinder, bumble and hinge (coffee dates, yoga, hiking, farmers markets, yadda yadda).\n\nwe can have fun instead. although that's the point... a guy's idea of \"fun\" is often different from women's idea and that's where the money typically comes into play.",

It doesn\u2019t mean the rest of arrangement will be vanilla or a normal relationship (it can still be sex-based). It just means your giving her time to get to know the SD.",

They can blame the guys for being creeps or weirdos or rude, etc... but no amount of currency will end that primordial, ancestral need for a committed vanilla monogamous relationship.\n\nThat's why i see so many beautiful women walking dogs in this town.

The reason why men are flocking to these sugaring websites is because they know that the women on there know that they have to be on their A-Game when it comes to looks, conversation, sex, and just overall companionship. That\u2019s why there is a more curated selection of attractive women versus regular vanilla dating websites. And sex isn\u2019t the only thing that\u2019s expected from a sugar baby. You don\u2019t take an escort on a meet and greet because conversation isn\u2019t important in those transactions. It is strictly about sex. While sugaring is more of a GFE type of interaction, like a relationship without the commitment and with full transparency. But there\u2019s many different types of SRs that range on the spectrum of more transactional to more committed. Many SRs have ended up with marriage and many SDs and SBs fall in love. So I agree with the person that commented that you have a very black and white way of looking at sugaring.",

I've met amazing women there and had amazing interactions that were not about money at all. we were able to be open and honest with each other and connect authentically, in ways you can't do on Hinge, Tinder and Bumble because women on those sites are looking to settle down  and have vanilla relationships.\n\ni love that i can go to SA and have fun and meet open minded girls (who in THEIR words say they're NOT LOOKING FOR A RELATIONSHIP), so i dont have to jump through all the typical relationship hoops of tinder, bumble and hinge (coffee dates, yoga, hiking, farmers markets, yadda yadda).\n\nwe can have fun instead. although that's the point... a guy's idea of \"fun\" is often different from women's idea and that's where the money typically comes into play.",

They can blame the guys for being creeps or weirdos or rude, etc... but no amount of currency will end that primordial, ancestral need for a committed vanilla monogamous relationship.\n\nThat's why i see so many beautiful women walking dogs in this town.

They can blame the guys for being creeps or weirdos or rude, etc... but no amount of currency will end that primordial, ancestral need for a committed vanilla monogamous relationship.\n\nThat's why i see so many beautiful women walking dogs in this town.
