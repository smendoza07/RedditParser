    "body": "Y\u2019all, it\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve posted. I missed you.\n\nI was about to leave the bowl out of frustration from all the b.s. To make a long story short, Mr. Ostomy man was so flabbergasted that I was casually dating someone else\u2014despite us never talking about being exclusive\u2014that he asked for me to give his money back! Tuh. Then he realized he fucked up and sent me MORE money to try and start talking again. I got whiplash, y\u2019all. Had to drop it.\n\nSo after that entire fiasco, I was haphazardly looking on SA, but I wasn\u2019t super responsive and figured that if Jesus Christ himself did not place a quality SD in my life, I was probably done being an SB.\n\nWell, there was one guy I had been talking to on and off for a few weeks who was very nice. I had reached out to him first on SA because I loved his profile, but our communication fell off due to some personal issues cropping up in my life. I reconnected with him last week and we decided to meet up a few days ago. \n\nLook, I\u2019m not religious, but this man had to be an act of God or something.\n\nHe picks me up in a Tessie \ud83e\udd2a and we go off to get lunch. We warm up to each other over boba and he suggests a hike. Now, I\u2019m wearing some cute platform sandals, so not exactly prepped to hike. Not a problem, he decides, as he proceeds to buy me shoes! Alright, I\u2019m impressed \ud83c\udf1a while shopping, we\u2019re talking about random shit and computers come up. He asks me what kind of laptop I have and I tell him I have an old HP. His face contorts and he says \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll have to fix that.\u201d SIR? I just had to leave that be because I\u2019m not tryna read too much into what he says too soon. He also said he was gonna help me get my shoe game up, which I brushed off because I can\u2019t believe anything til I see it. \n\nOur hike went okay until there was a tick in his car from the trail that we drowned with hand sanitizer. Fun shit. Time for dinner! He gives me restaurant choice and I choose Panda Express because I\u2019m a whore for orange chicken. And whaddya know? He is, too.\n\nWe eat and vibe while his car charges. It\u2019s getting dark and he invites me back to his place. Unfortunately, my coochie was on \u2728Bloody Mary\u2728, so I told him no sexy-time. His offer still stood!\n\nSo we go to his house, cuddle, and talk. He is such a sweetheart and a gentleman and does everything to make me comfortable. I had an early morning the next day, so he drops me back at home later in the night.\n\nThen YESTERDAY, he tells me he has a surprise for me that a) will change my life and b) I cannot wear. He says got this for me based on our conversation about love languages (also in the shoe store). This man picks me up with our DELICIOUS taco dinner and some batteries that he fuckin got for me because he HEARD MY DYING SMOKE DETECTOR BEEPING OVER THE PHONE AND WANTS TO CHANGE THE BATTERY FOR ME \ud83d\ude2d\n\nAlready, my Acts of Service loving ass is over the moon. But wait! This isn\u2019t my surprise, he says. We go into his house, swallow the tacos, and he hands me a box.\nNow, I had a hunch, but I didn\u2019t want to get too excited. At the end of the day, he could\u2019ve given me a pack of peanut m&amp;ms and I would\u2019ve been elated.\n\nI open the box. No fucking way.\n\nThis man got me a fucking MacBook. WHOLE ASS M1 CHIP YALL. I ain\u2019t even put the pussy on him yet!\n\nWe hug, we kiss, we move to the bedroom and once again cuddle for the night because my pussy is on BBQ sauce (if you know, you know). I wake up and put my jeans back on and BOOM: cash allowance chillin in my back pocket. I was on the brink of tears yall \ud83d\ude2d you know how sick I have been of having to ASK for my allowance that these men agreed to GIVE?\n\nThere are so many other highlights but in an attempt to not bore yall to death, I\u2019ll just say that the sugar gods are real and to hang in there if shit\u2019s tough right now!\n\nTl;dr: thank you sugar gods for finally giving me an ACTUAL FUCKING SUGAR DADDY",
