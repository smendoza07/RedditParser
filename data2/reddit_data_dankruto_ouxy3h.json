            "body": "While ninjas blasting fireballs at each other isn't \"realistic\" the original did fit somewhat into defined limits.\n\nEven though it started with low power stuff, one of the first things established was the power of the Kyuubi and that it was sealed in Naruto. So it was always going to creep to that level of power.\n\nI'd say where things started shark jumping was introducing Kaguya. She's fairly explicitly an alien like entity that comes from nowhere. All the weird shit previously like Deidera's hand mouths, Pain's robot body guy, Kisame being a shark guy or whatever the fuck Kazaku had going on was never really explained so it doesn't outright break the suspension of disbelief around the established rules of the world.\n\nThe stuff in Boruto with everyone explicitly being an alien or cyborg, particularly when they seem to be operating above Kage level, kind of breaks that suspension of disbelief given what we expect and know about the world. \n\nI like Boruto, but I can see how the relatively sudden transition from magic ninja shit to aliens and cyborgs could be off putting to some. More so given that prior to this there was never any indication of there being the technology to allow for this type of stuff, Naruto needed the world's greatest medical ninja and Hashirama cells to get his arm back. Now you've got all sorts of people being grown and created wholesale.",

However in the last movie more define what the technology is maybe have it so they were working on something that might have destroyed the moon if Naruto failed. Then for boruto make the technology bit less advanced since it makes no sense for it be that good, especially kawaki\u2019s arm. Then instead of Kara being some sort of alien god group shit. Make it\u2019s a group of ninjas that have some sort of high level tech that puts them at the strength of the akustukai. Then to make it so you can just say \u201coh where\u2019s Naruto and sasuke\u201d increase the size of the world, start showing new nations and such maybe now North America is in play and more and more independent cities are popping up enough that it keep Naruto busy with paper work and sasuke could be investigating something. Maybe have it that the new Kara came from these village. Basically the show would be New vs Old, Tradition vs Tech. And boruto\u2019s special thing could be some sort of evolved byakugen and some sort of tech enhancements he gets later down the line",

Also Naruto would logically take a ton of burdens onto himself because his shadow clones can accomplish so much, so after he\u2019s gone, and you don\u2019t have Sasuke always scouting out new threats it makes sense that the world might be unprepared for a big event to come and kick-start the plot of the series.",

For a Japanese viewer they\u2019d be like \u201coh shit, the rabbit goddess of the moon Kagya\u201d - it\u2019s kinda like it Zeus or Thor rocked up in a modern western show, they kind expect the audience to be like \u201coh dear, a wrathful storm god is here\u201d  so when taken literally as \u201cKaguya is an alien from the moon\u201d it sounds much more far fetched and off-kilter, but if you remember that Kyubi and all the other beasts are essentially nature spirits, it\u2019s not that unreasonable to find out that there was a god/goddess involved. Genuinely, I expected that Amaterasu, Tsukuyomi, Susanoo  etc to be deific pre-ninja beings that were important to the story, however they went with Ashira, Indra, and Kaguya but the point there is that it\u2019s all tied back to Japanese mythology. From the little I\u2019ve heard about Boruto that made Kaguya into the matriarch of a whole species/clan of godlike aliens - I have heard nothing of robots though, and I always assumed the Pain-bot was a sand ninja he killed that had puppet-bodied themself like Sasori.",

There's nothing ninja-like about a mfer with multiple hearts and giant black flying thingies. Same shit with Orochimaru and his creep ass tendencies trying to steal bodies and shit. Pain with his otherworldy power and even robotics capable of launching missiles and bullets. \n\nThey're not more ninja-like just because they punch and kick, and sometimes throw a kunai here and there. Again, I think Naruto has completely skewed your perception of what a ninja actually is.

Naruto's first real arc was the Zabuza and Haku arc. That fight grappled tough themes and packed a lot of emotion. It was the day Naruto learnt what being a Ninja really means. It was the best arc to get me to continue watching until the show's end. Look at how Naruto clings to Kakashi like a child \ud83e\udd7a. Zabuza and Haku helped shape the Hokage Naruto becomes. Then we got Boruto over here with a trash filler arc where he goes on a school trip, gets into a fight with fodder reject Swordsmen and saves the day learning nothing. I watched all 720 episodes of Naruto at regular speed (fillers included), but I watch Boruto at x2 speed (sometimes x2.5 speeds).\n\nI gave up but was reccomended to read the manga. I didn't want to end the Naruto Universe on a sad note so I read the manga. Best choice ever. Most of my gripes with the story have been mostly due to anime waffle. I eventually came back to the anime. Boruto ends up learning a valuable lesson when watching his dad tank Momoshiki's big attack. I have hope for Boruto Shippuden and future story arcs.",

Look at Naruto he's got a beast, Kashi and Sasuke got the sharing an and crazy amount of jutsu, Sakura has a seal that makes her immortal, might guy turns into a fucking one man army. None of these characters are considered \"human\" by the real life standards , they are extraordinary at least. So before bringing up shit like a kunai can kill someone think if it actually has killed anyone in the Naruto series, like ever.",

Make it\u2019s a group of ninjas that have some sort of high level tech that puts them at the strength of the akustukai. Then to make it so you can just say \u201coh where\u2019s Naruto and sasuke\u201d increase the size of the world, start showing new nations and such maybe now North America is in play and more and more independent cities are popping up enough that it keep Naruto busy with paper work and sasuke could be investigating something. Maybe have it that the new Kara came from these village. Basically the show would be New vs Old, Tradition vs Tech. And boruto\u2019s special thing could be some sort of evolved byakugen and some sort of tech enhancements he gets later down the line",

Also Naruto would logically take a ton of burdens onto himself because his shadow clones can accomplish so much, so after he\u2019s gone, and you don\u2019t have Sasuke always scouting out new threats it makes sense that the world might be unprepared for a big event to come and kick-start the plot of the series.",

For a Japanese viewer they\u2019d be like \u201coh shit, the rabbit goddess of the moon Kagya\u201d - it\u2019s kinda like it Zeus or Thor rocked up in a modern western show, they kind expect the audience to be like \u201coh dear, a wrathful storm god is here\u201d  so when taken literally as \u201cKaguya is an alien from the moon\u201d it sounds much more far fetched and off-kilter, but if you remember that Kyubi and all the other beasts are essentially nature spirits, it\u2019s not that unreasonable to find out that there was a god/goddess involved. Genuinely, I expected that Amaterasu, Tsukuyomi, Susanoo  etc to be deific pre-ninja beings that were important to the story, however they went with Ashira, Indra, and Kaguya but the point there is that it\u2019s all tied back to Japanese mythology. From the little I\u2019ve heard about Boruto that made Kaguya into the matriarch of a whole species/clan of godlike aliens - I have heard nothing of robots though, and I always assumed the Pain-bot was a sand ninja he killed that had puppet-bodied themself like Sasori.",

Especially since we don\u2019t have the contrived family issues coming from Naruto not just having shadow clones do his work. Also Naruto would logically take a ton of burdens onto himself because his shadow clones can accomplish so much, so after he\u2019s gone, and you don\u2019t have Sasuke always scouting out new threats it makes sense that the world might be unprepared for a big event to come and kick-start the plot of the series.",

Also Naruto would logically take a ton of burdens onto himself because his shadow clones can accomplish so much, so after he\u2019s gone, and you don\u2019t have Sasuke always scouting out new threats it makes sense that the world might be unprepared for a big event to come and kick-start the plot of the series.",

Also Naruto would logically take a ton of burdens onto himself because his shadow clones can accomplish so much, so after he\u2019s gone, and you don\u2019t have Sasuke always scouting out new threats it makes sense that the world might be unprepared for a big event to come and kick-start the plot of the series.",
