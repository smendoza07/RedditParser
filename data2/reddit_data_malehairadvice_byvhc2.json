They\u2019re often hair nerds and love this shit. It\u2019s a cheap way to try different products as the better stuff is often a bit pricey.

They\u2019re often hair nerds and love this shit. It\u2019s a cheap way to try different products as the better stuff is often a bit pricey. Hair products are SO individual that it sucks to buy a highly recommended product for $60 only to find out if just doesn\u2019t work for your hair or lifestyle.",

It\u2019s a cheap way to try different products as the better stuff is often a bit pricey. Hair products are SO individual that it sucks to buy a highly recommended product for $60 only to find out if just doesn\u2019t work for your hair or lifestyle.",
