There are broader things going on, but they're fairly manageable to keep track of. Kishi set up a bunch of plot points and series-long conflicts right at the beginning, and Naruto arcs aren't really self contained. Every arc leads right into the next one. I'd say Naruto is a fair bit more complex because of that. Not saying he couldn't have done better, but Naruto and OP have inherently different forms of storytelling.",

I\u2019m here to look at insane drawings of alien gods fighting ninja super Sayans, not watch Sakura become a fully functioning adult.

The only thing he accomplished in the whole story was making Gaara look slightly less menacing.\n\nThe only way side characters like him could get more shine is if the writers put in arcs that had nothing to with main story and that\u2019s what the anime filler and movies already accomplish.",

But if you want people to care about your characters, they need to have some semblance of depth and plot relevance.\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely absurd to pretend that it would be impossible to include more character development in a series as long as naruto. I absolutely love the show, but it did so many of its characters so dirty. Compare it to any other show, even other anime, and I think you\u2019ll see what I mean.\n\nAt the end of the day I love the show, and you\u2019re entitled to your opinion. Have a good night!",
