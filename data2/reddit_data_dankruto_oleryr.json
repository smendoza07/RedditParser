Ignore this comment, I attributed the Rasenshuriken learning process to the rasengan training.\n\nNaruto used his clones combined experience to learn it faster. So technically you have to count all the time his clones existed practicing and add it together. He also had the benefit of an instructor to tell him how to use it, rather than developing it from scratch. So it would be the number of clones used during his training to learn it, times a little over a week. The experience of the clones is combined and given to Naruto when they disappear.\n\nFor reference: Just summoning 50 clones and using them to train for 1 week is equal to over a year of training.",

Him using his army of shadow clowns allowed him to essentially use trial and error until he figured it out.  Boruto just cranks out an A ranked Jutsu at age 10 then make it S rank at age 11. That's absurd no matter how you look at it. \n\nKakashi graduated the academy at age 5, became a Jonin at 11, and was an ANBU captain at 13. He could never achieve what Boruto did as an 11 year old Genin. The power creep on Boruto is outlandish and its only a matter of time before the new team 7 are all Kage level 15 year olds whom have all mastered sage mode and have planet destroying jutsus at the ready.",

Then when the Sand Shinobi interfered it wasn't even fair because it was established early on that they had already surpassed chunin level and were held back from taking the Chunin Exams on purpose.\n\nSo it wasn't too unrealistic when the Sound 4 got beat considering how many opponents they fought in short succession.

Sasuke mastered fireball which used both form and an elemental release as a young child without the sharingan? Plus, Naruto beat kabuto without the nine tails who supposedly matched kakashi at the time. Also I didn\u2019t say the power scaling in the original Naruto was bad I said it was okay. Also Boruto supposedly trains just as hard now along with being a genius and having years of personal training from his parents who area again incredibly strong. I think the show probably shows this poorly as I generally don\u2019t think the actual delivery of Boruto is very good, just that it doesn\u2019t destroy the cannon power scaling. If your still reading this I also find it a little ironic that the people saying new team seven is way to op and beating god level opponents also say old team seven would completely crap on them in a fight. It just makes both arguments a little hard to agree with.",

Sasuke wanted to learn it to keep up with Naruto as well as try to become stronger to beat Itachi. \n\nSarada learned chidori because her dad is Sasuke.",

Like just look back on the zabuza fight, only Kakashi could fight him and that scared the shit out of the others. Naruto and Sasuke fought Haku and both nearly died and only won because of the Fox. \n\nIn boruto konohamaru is seemingly weaker then them. Genin now are just strait up stronger then the everyone else. Looking back at the Naruto chunin exams we see that fight with neji and hinata and it seems like he's on a completly different level. then the adults just waltz in and completly stop it. \n\nTo me it's just so unbelievable that this new generation is just so God damn strong. From everything I've seen the only people that can show them up is Naruto and Sasuke the two strongest people in the world.",

If you're complaining about kids learning more than 1 jutsu, I recommend to watch again the parts where Itachi, Kakashi, Shisui, Minato, Sai, etc all became jonins/anbu and shit like at the age of being in the academy. The power scaling thing is just an illusion, Sasuke and Sarada both had sharingan and learnt chidori at the same age. And Naruto and Sasuke indeed fought Zabuza. \n\nWhen it comes to Konohamaru he's just not always shown solving every issue otherwise there's no problematic story to develop. If you paid attention, there were a lot of times where Konohamaru solo'ed enemies. But you'd expect that he can't do something against fucking Akatsuki 2.0. He fought Victor who was one of the handful people to master all 5 elements, who was fast and all. Then he fought Jigen, how do you expect him to beat Jigen? Luckily he had plot armour and Jigen said he wanted to have some fun fighting (so that he doesn't kill Konohamaru).",

She's just awful all around unfortunately. And while Sarada and boruto for example definitely have it easier, that precedent was set from the start of Boruto. I mean they literally outright stated boruto had mastered like 3 Chakra nature's already. \n\nAt the end of the day I think people just don't like talent and that's okay. It however, doesn't make a show inherently bad because of it. There are a lot more aspects in Boruto that make it worse than Naruto + Naruto Shippuden. I think the whole power scale thing is just used by mostly salty fans who don't have the right words (or intelligence in some cases) to argue the real problems with Boruto.",

Naruto was not smart, but he has enormous chakra. Boruto smart af but no enormous chakra. It took weeks for Naruto, with a 1000 clones to cut a SINGLE LEAF in half using his wind chakra. It took Boruto 2 episodes and my man was spamming Gale Palm. \"They are not wasting time on training arcs\". Ok fair enough. But plz don't make them soooo fcking strong. Don't make something like chakra natures, ADDING chakra natures to other Justus so easy. Coz as I said, they are making the logic - \"new gen surpasses old gen\" look absurd coz if the new gen comes out to be sooo powerful.. then the next gen, Boruto's son knowing ALL 5 chakra natures from his mother's womb, him mastering the Rasenshuriken in 2 hours and adding Fire, Lightning, Water, Earth, Yin and Yang nature to it in the next 2 hours should not be something surprising. Boruto's grandson creating a 100 clones just to trouble his mom while she is changing his diaper too should not be surprising then..",

Also he can use wood release because he already has hasi cells in his hand. So I don't know why you said he lost. It's misunderstanding by community here.\n\n>Not learning a new jutsu makes sense if he doesn't really need to. Also, there's a mudwall in Boruto so he kinda did, actually.\n\nJust see 4 th hokage. He was basically doing all hokage duty along with learning. Not to forget Naruto didn't became hokage right of the bat but instead he trained himself more after the war.

Changing your mind is admitting defeat in their minds.\n\nSecond, these people just want to keep pointing and laughing and saying how much it sucks because it validates the idea in their head that what *they* grew up with or loved is better than whatever those darn whippersnappers like. They can't go back on the idea of Naruto being the best, even though they only said that the first time because Naruto was the first they truly loved.\n\nAlso, saying that you get 400 episode of good canon in Naruto while only getting 60 or so in Boruto is bullshit on multiple accounts, first of all the fact that Naruto is *finished* and ran for *15 years*. Boruto has only been around for just under 5 years and saying that only 10 of the proclaimed 60 canon episodes are good is just ignorance. The manga is fantastic and the episodes directly adapting the manga have been stellar. \n\nAlso, from a technical standpoint, the whole Boruto anime is canon. Not necessarily present in the manga, but still canon story. So, since I wanna be a persnickety bitch rn, there is technically speaking 0 filler episodes in Boruto, only non-manga episodes.\n\nEven a lot of non-manga content in the Boruto anime is adaptations of things such as light novels, and are pretty good. Obviously some are better than others, but they all at least *try* something new or to explore a new facet of the Naruto world. Shin Uchiha was weird, but it explored the relationship between Sarada and her parents, and we even got to see a decent fight for Sakura, which she has deserved for a long time. \n\nA lot of non-manga content recently actually *helps* tell the story by filling in the *numerous* holes and gaps that are littered all through out the manga. Exploring characters, their relationships, their struggles, the systems in place, and most importantly, how the world works now that Naruto is Hokage.\n\nAre there arcs, plot lines, characters, encounters, and episodes of Boruto I dislike? Of course there are. But to write off the entire show because it dares to be different is insane.",

There were already exceptional talents like Gaara that could finesse regular jonins at any point. Of course, the story needed that for actual stakes and to make it entertaining. The way I see it, they didn't want another Naruto copy, and decided to give the kids a different kind of struggle, which I appreciate. People seem to just want a Naruto copy, hence the constant complaining on Boruto's character despite several chapters worth of development",

Ik the point of boruto is to be different than Naruto and he js supposed to lose everything when he grows up unlike Naruto.",

Some Jonins could do it coz apparently they had good chakra control and could collect enough chakra to do the Jutsu.. others could not. Boruto is a kid with Normal chakra. Stop saying the same old thing, \"Boruto is a prodigy\" \"He got Minato genes\".. he doesn't have enough chakra, nor his chakra control is equal to Jonins like Kakashi rn.

It is not 20 year olds or 30 year olds who grew up watching naruto. It's targeted to the kids who were are age when we started watching Naruto. If it was targeted at us they'd continue off where Shippuden left. If it was just a cash grab don't you think it'd be more profitable to do that instead of develop an entirely new cast of characters that you have to go through and develop? The risk is way too fucking high if it's just a cash grab. If the goal was just to make money, you'd continue off doing Naruto shit, with him as the main character.

Sarada is OP because her dad is the strongest of an already blatantly OP clan that was gifted power from the first Ninja Jesus. Yes the power scaling is wonk a lot in Boruto but most of the time it\u2019s for the narrative themes to continue. \n\nI like Boruto for what it is. A fun show about what the kids of my childhood heroes are doing and what life in the ninja world is like with naruto completing what he set out to do after he accomplished his goal and settled down. \n\nDislike it if you want and you are more than welcome to criticize the wonky power scaling, the cringe early episodes, the questionable character decisions, the odd world progression, etc. There are people who like the show and it\u2019s perfectly ok to do so.",

Or even the one about Cho-Cho becoming thin and crushing on that actor who dislikes chubby girls. \n\nBut man they somehow managed to ruin the tournament arc. Legit should have only had that tournament arc after a couple of serious character developing episodes. \n\nThe only thing I hate about Boruto is the character designs for our OG Konoha peoples. The Last had the best character designs in the entire series. Outside of exceptions like Itachi's introduction in Naruto P1 and the Akatsuki's general uniform.",

Ignore this comment, I attributed the Rasenshuriken learning process to the rasengan training.\n\nNaruto used his clones combined experience to learn it faster. So technically you have to count all the time his clones existed practicing and add it together. He also had the benefit of an instructor to tell him how to use it, rather than developing it from scratch. So it would be the number of clones used during his training to learn it, times a little over a week. The experience of the clones is combined and given to Naruto when they disappear.\n\nFor reference: Just summoning 50 clones and using them to train for 1 week is equal to over a year of training.",

That's absurd no matter how you look at it. \n\nKakashi graduated the academy at age 5, became a Jonin at 11, and was an ANBU captain at 13. He could never achieve what Boruto did as an 11 year old Genin. The power creep on Boruto is outlandish and its only a matter of time before the new team 7 are all Kage level 15 year olds whom have all mastered sage mode and have planet destroying jutsus at the ready.",

Then when the Sand Shinobi interfered it wasn't even fair because it was established early on that they had already surpassed chunin level and were held back from taking the Chunin Exams on purpose.\n\nSo it wasn't too unrealistic when the Sound 4 got beat considering how many opponents they fought in short succession.

So before you insult Naruto\u2019s power scaling pay attention to the fact that genin are fighting planet level characters in base in Boruto. Isn\u2019t that far fetched?",

Sasuke mastered fireball which used both form and an elemental release as a young child without the sharingan? Plus, Naruto beat kabuto without the nine tails who supposedly matched kakashi at the time. Also I didn\u2019t say the power scaling in the original Naruto was bad I said it was okay. Also Boruto supposedly trains just as hard now along with being a genius and having years of personal training from his parents who area again incredibly strong. I think the show probably shows this poorly as I generally don\u2019t think the actual delivery of Boruto is very good, just that it doesn\u2019t destroy the cannon power scaling. If your still reading this I also find it a little ironic that the people saying new team seven is way to op and beating god level opponents also say old team seven would completely crap on them in a fight. It just makes both arguments a little hard to agree with.",

The power scaling thing is just an illusion, Sasuke and Sarada both had sharingan and learnt chidori at the same age. And Naruto and Sasuke indeed fought Zabuza. \n\nWhen it comes to Konohamaru he's just not always shown solving every issue otherwise there's no problematic story to develop. If you paid attention, there were a lot of times where Konohamaru solo'ed enemies. But you'd expect that he can't do something against fucking Akatsuki 2.0. He fought Victor who was one of the handful people to master all 5 elements, who was fast and all. Then he fought Jigen, how do you expect him to beat Jigen? Luckily he had plot armour and Jigen said he wanted to have some fun fighting (so that he doesn't kill Konohamaru).",

I mean they literally outright stated boruto had mastered like 3 Chakra nature's already. \n\nAt the end of the day I think people just don't like talent and that's okay. It however, doesn't make a show inherently bad because of it. There are a lot more aspects in Boruto that make it worse than Naruto + Naruto Shippuden. I think the whole power scale thing is just used by mostly salty fans who don't have the right words (or intelligence in some cases) to argue the real problems with Boruto.",

It just makes the characters less realistic and relatable to me personally. I liked watching the characters grow into their strengths in Naruto and it almost feels like that was taken away in Boruto. It feels like a cheap plot device.",

Naruto was not smart, but he has enormous chakra. Boruto smart af but no enormous chakra. It took weeks for Naruto, with a 1000 clones to cut a SINGLE LEAF in half using his wind chakra. It took Boruto 2 episodes and my man was spamming Gale Palm. \"They are not wasting time on training arcs\". Ok fair enough. But plz don't make them soooo fcking strong. Don't make something like chakra natures, ADDING chakra natures to other Justus so easy. Coz as I said, they are making the logic - \"new gen surpasses old gen\" look absurd coz if the new gen comes out to be sooo powerful.. then the next gen, Boruto's son knowing ALL 5 chakra natures from his mother's womb, him mastering the Rasenshuriken in 2 hours and adding Fire, Lightning, Water, Earth, Yin and Yang nature to it in the next 2 hours should not be something surprising. Boruto's grandson creating a 100 clones just to trouble his mom while she is changing his diaper too should not be surprising then..",

Just go and check the manga, it was stated that Naruto and sasuke possess all the power given by so6p. So he not using all those things are to make him weak. Also he can use wood release because he already has hasi cells in his hand. So I don't know why you said he lost. It's misunderstanding by community here.\n\n>Not learning a new jutsu makes sense if he doesn't really need to. Also, there's a mudwall in Boruto so he kinda did, actually.\n\nJust see 4 th hokage. He was basically doing all hokage duty along with learning. Not to forget Naruto didn't became hokage right of the bat but instead he trained himself more after the war. So it's doesn't make sense tbh.\n\n>Naruto never learned Flying Raijin. When you say the end of shippuden, I'm assuming you mean the times Tobirama and Minato use it to assist Naruto.

I think it was cut in anime to smooth the jigen fight but it was stated that Naruto can't sense jigen bc he is small.(community was crazy about this when it revealed in manga, I think \nit was because to make Naruto and sasuke weak so anime changed this slightly but still I am pissed about this bc Naruto was not able to tell jigen location even in anime which was brief moment)\n\n>I'm not saying the Boruto power-creep is flawless, or hell even that it's good at all, but at least get the facts straight and use a little bit of logic when thinking about why we don't see certain things used.

Yes everything can't be perfect but at least if it consistence then I am fine but as you see no matter what they did it doesn't goes that well.",

Changing your mind is admitting defeat in their minds.\n\nSecond, these people just want to keep pointing and laughing and saying how much it sucks because it validates the idea in their head that what *they* grew up with or loved is better than whatever those darn whippersnappers like. They can't go back on the idea of Naruto being the best, even though they only said that the first time because Naruto was the first they truly loved.\n\nAlso, saying that you get 400 episode of good canon in Naruto while only getting 60 or so in Boruto is bullshit on multiple accounts, first of all the fact that Naruto is *finished* and ran for *15 years*. Boruto has only been around for just under 5 years and saying that only 10 of the proclaimed 60 canon episodes are good is just ignorance. The manga is fantastic and the episodes directly adapting the manga have been stellar. \n\nAlso, from a technical standpoint, the whole Boruto anime is canon. Not necessarily present in the manga, but still canon story. So, since I wanna be a persnickety bitch rn, there is technically speaking 0 filler episodes in Boruto, only non-manga episodes.\n\nEven a lot of non-manga content in the Boruto anime is adaptations of things such as light novels, and are pretty good. Obviously some are better than others, but they all at least *try* something new or to explore a new facet of the Naruto world. Shin Uchiha was weird, but it explored the relationship between Sarada and her parents, and we even got to see a decent fight for Sakura, which she has deserved for a long time. \n\nA lot of non-manga content recently actually *helps* tell the story by filling in the *numerous* holes and gaps that are littered all through out the manga. Exploring characters, their relationships, their struggles, the systems in place, and most importantly, how the world works now that Naruto is Hokage.\n\nAre there arcs, plot lines, characters, encounters, and episodes of Boruto I dislike? Of course there are. But to write off the entire show because it dares to be different is insane.",

They're animating the last arc of Bleach after the anime was canceled in 2012.\n\nWith Boruto they're inserting an unnecessary sequel that no one really asked for. People like the light novels because they fleshed out the Naruto world and answered questions that Kishimoto didn't have time to answer. Kubo's next work (Burn the Witch) is set in the world of Bleach but focuses on completely different characters with different themes, settings, and powers. \n\nIt's not shoving Ichigo's son in front of you and saying \"Hey remember Ichigo? Here is his son and he'll fight even more powerful villains than Ichigo fought while we sideline Ichigo and vaguely foreshadow that he might die so that we can get people to care about it. Also, it's going to be about aliens and sci-fi rather than magic.\"\n\nAlso, I was trying my best to be polite here (I literally said it's fine if you like it) but it seems you don't respond to that well so have a nice day asshole and keep being delusional about a blatant cash grab.",

Ignore this comment, I attributed the Rasenshuriken learning process to the rasengan training.\n\nNaruto used his clones combined experience to learn it faster. So technically you have to count all the time his clones existed practicing and add it together. He also had the benefit of an instructor to tell him how to use it, rather than developing it from scratch. So it would be the number of clones used during his training to learn it, times a little over a week. The experience of the clones is combined and given to Naruto when they disappear.\n\nFor reference: Just summoning 50 clones and using them to train for 1 week is equal to over a year of training.",

That's absurd no matter how you look at it. \n\nKakashi graduated the academy at age 5, became a Jonin at 11, and was an ANBU captain at 13. He could never achieve what Boruto did as an 11 year old Genin. The power creep on Boruto is outlandish and its only a matter of time before the new team 7 are all Kage level 15 year olds whom have all mastered sage mode and have planet destroying jutsus at the ready.",

Superman stories revolve around the progression of the self, and overcoming your mental barriers rather your physical ones (boruto vs asta(black clover)) for example.\n\nBoruto has done a lot of growth in that respect. It's just a different kind of story. If you don't like it, don't watch it.",

Plus, they were heavily fatigued, just finishing a mission and managed to push them to using Version 2 and highly tiring them out.

I have no doubt that Naruto executes the ideas better but I\u2019ve never really had much issue with Boruto\u2019s in universe implications, just found watching the show very tedious and rather boring compared to Naruto and Shippuden",

So before you insult Naruto\u2019s power scaling pay attention to the fact that genin are fighting planet level characters in base in Boruto. Isn\u2019t that far fetched?",

Sasuke mastered fireball which used both form and an elemental release as a young child without the sharingan? Plus, Naruto beat kabuto without the nine tails who supposedly matched kakashi at the time. Also I didn\u2019t say the power scaling in the original Naruto was bad I said it was okay. Also Boruto supposedly trains just as hard now along with being a genius and having years of personal training from his parents who area again incredibly strong. I think the show probably shows this poorly as I generally don\u2019t think the actual delivery of Boruto is very good, just that it doesn\u2019t destroy the cannon power scaling. If your still reading this I also find it a little ironic that the people saying new team seven is way to op and beating god level opponents also say old team seven would completely crap on them in a fight. It just makes both arguments a little hard to agree with.",

I mean they literally outright stated boruto had mastered like 3 Chakra nature's already. \n\nAt the end of the day I think people just don't like talent and that's okay. It however, doesn't make a show inherently bad because of it. There are a lot more aspects in Boruto that make it worse than Naruto + Naruto Shippuden. I think the whole power scale thing is just used by mostly salty fans who don't have the right words (or intelligence in some cases) to argue the real problems with Boruto.",

            "body": ">You can say what you want to about Boruto, but at least get the facts straight for Naruto. I agree sage-mode went underused, but that's because it was overshadowed by the much stronger KCM, something that makes sense as a technique Naruto should learn to become hokage (if he can't control kurama, he's basically a time bomb). \n\nI am not saying sage mode, I was saying sage mode fighting style which he can use along side kcm2.(I believe it was frog kurmit or something).\n\n>Borrowing other Bijuu's chakra, wood release, and truthseeker orbs were lost when Naruto and Sasuke blasted each other's arms off and thus destroyed the seals from the Sage of Six Paths.\n\nI think you are mistaken here. Just go and check the manga, it was stated that Naruto and sasuke possess all the power given by so6p. So he not using all those things are to make him weak. Also he can use wood release because he already has hasi cells in his hand. So I don't know why you said he lost. It's misunderstanding by community here.\n\n>Not learning a new jutsu makes sense if he doesn't really need to. Also, there's a mudwall in Boruto so he kinda did, actually.\n\nJust see 4 th hokage. He was basically doing all hokage duty along with learning. Not to forget Naruto didn't became hokage right of the bat but instead he trained himself more after the war. So it's doesn't make sense tbh.\n\n>Naruto never learned Flying Raijin. When you say the end of shippuden, I'm assuming you mean the times Tobirama and Minato use it to assist Naruto. The only other things I can think of are the Final, 700th chapter of the manga where Naruto seemingly teleports to stop Boruto's graffiti and the Road to Ninja Movie. Starting with Chapter 700, Boruto *immediately* tells us it's not the Flying Raijin that Naruto uses, which is arguably unnecessary given the raw speed of Naruto in either sage-mode (nearly-instantly taking down one of the paths of pain) and KCM (dodging A), but it is in fact the Shunshin no Jutsu, or the Body Flicker Technique. The lil poofy thing tons of Jonin uses and the thing that Shisui became a master of. Then there's the movie, which is not canon. None of the movies are. Also, even if it were, it happens within the Infinite Tsukuyomi dream real\n\nI think it was chapter 700. Boruto said himself who is prodigy that Naruto used FTG. Later it was debunked by kisi because he made Naruto way too op in Boruto.\n\n>As for his sensory techniques, he seems to not use them, but most likely still can. He simply has no reason to when the much more robust sensory system put in place by Ino is far more reliable, and using senjutsu to sense everything all the time would be incredibly draining\n\nI am not taking about normal sensory ability. I think it was cut in anime to smooth the jigen fight but it was stated that Naruto can't sense jigen bc he is small.(community was crazy about this when it revealed in manga, I think \nit was because to make Naruto and sasuke weak so anime changed this slightly but still I am pissed about this bc Naruto was not able to tell jigen location even in anime which was brief moment)\n\n>I'm not saying the Boruto power-creep is flawless, or hell even that it's good at all, but at least get the facts straight and use a little bit of logic when thinking about why we don't see certain things used. Like. Come on...\n\nI used logic my friend. They didn't used things because it will end up being plot holes. I am type of guy which I mentioned earlier that I like to analyse the event. Yes everything can't be perfect but at least if it consistence then I am fine but as you see no matter what they did it doesn't goes that well.",

Changing your mind is admitting defeat in their minds.\n\nSecond, these people just want to keep pointing and laughing and saying how much it sucks because it validates the idea in their head that what *they* grew up with or loved is better than whatever those darn whippersnappers like. They can't go back on the idea of Naruto being the best, even though they only said that the first time because Naruto was the first they truly loved.\n\nAlso, saying that you get 400 episode of good canon in Naruto while only getting 60 or so in Boruto is bullshit on multiple accounts, first of all the fact that Naruto is *finished* and ran for *15 years*. Boruto has only been around for just under 5 years and saying that only 10 of the proclaimed 60 canon episodes are good is just ignorance. The manga is fantastic and the episodes directly adapting the manga have been stellar. \n\nAlso, from a technical standpoint, the whole Boruto anime is canon. Not necessarily present in the manga, but still canon story. So, since I wanna be a persnickety bitch rn, there is technically speaking 0 filler episodes in Boruto, only non-manga episodes.\n\nEven a lot of non-manga content in the Boruto anime is adaptations of things such as light novels, and are pretty good. Obviously some are better than others, but they all at least *try* something new or to explore a new facet of the Naruto world. Shin Uchiha was weird, but it explored the relationship between Sarada and her parents, and we even got to see a decent fight for Sakura, which she has deserved for a long time. \n\nA lot of non-manga content recently actually *helps* tell the story by filling in the *numerous* holes and gaps that are littered all through out the manga. Exploring characters, their relationships, their struggles, the systems in place, and most importantly, how the world works now that Naruto is Hokage.\n\nAre there arcs, plot lines, characters, encounters, and episodes of Boruto I dislike? Of course there are. But to write off the entire show because it dares to be different is insane.",

From now onwards.. it's pretty clear he won't rely entirely on his chakra but on his karma too. Naruto could do the Shadow clone jutsu just bcoz of the enormous chakra. Some Jonins could do it coz apparently they had good chakra control and could collect enough chakra to do the Jutsu.. others could not. Boruto is a kid with Normal chakra. Stop saying the same old thing, \"Boruto is a prodigy\" \"He got Minato genes\".. he doesn't have enough chakra, nor his chakra control is equal to Jonins like Kakashi rn.

If it was targeted at us they'd continue off where Shippuden left.

If Naruto ended and Boruto didn't come out, people would still be asking for more Naruto content. \n\nWe're also going to get Boruto with a dead Naruto. He's gonna die at some point, he like has to at some point. Because it's a story about Boruto. This is the story he wants to tell, and I'm assuming part of that story is showing Boruto's relationship with his father. You're literally judging an incomplete story and saying that the story has no point and is \"relying on nostalgia\". It's not relying on nostalgia because it's literally a new IP with a new story. That story just happens to include characters within the Universe the story is set it. Like? You just want to not like it. Just say you don't want to like it and that you're just a judgmental dick?",

They're animating the last arc of Bleach after the anime was canceled in 2012.\n\nWith Boruto they're inserting an unnecessary sequel that no one really asked for. People like the light novels because they fleshed out the Naruto world and answered questions that Kishimoto didn't have time to answer. Kubo's next work (Burn the Witch) is set in the world of Bleach but focuses on completely different characters with different themes, settings, and powers. \n\nIt's not shoving Ichigo's son in front of you and saying \"Hey remember Ichigo? Here is his son and he'll fight even more powerful villains than Ichigo fought while we sideline Ichigo and vaguely foreshadow that he might die so that we can get people to care about it. Also, it's going to be about aliens and sci-fi rather than magic.\"\n\nAlso, I was trying my best to be polite here (I literally said it's fine if you like it) but it seems you don't respond to that well so have a nice day asshole and keep being delusional about a blatant cash grab.",

So technically you have to count all the time his clones existed practicing and add it together. He also had the benefit of an instructor to tell him how to use it, rather than developing it from scratch. So it would be the number of clones used during his training to learn it, times a little over a week. The experience of the clones is combined and given to Naruto when they disappear.\n\nFor reference: Just summoning 50 clones and using them to train for 1 week is equal to over a year of training.",

That's absurd no matter how you look at it. \n\nKakashi graduated the academy at age 5, became a Jonin at 11, and was an ANBU captain at 13. He could never achieve what Boruto did as an 11 year old Genin. The power creep on Boruto is outlandish and its only a matter of time before the new team 7 are all Kage level 15 year olds whom have all mastered sage mode and have planet destroying jutsus at the ready.",

That is probably the single most used desire/will for a Lancer or anti-hero type character. What makes it a compelling will and motivation for Sasuke is that it was formed due to his trauma and his own experiences  rather than copying someone else. \n\nHinata wasn't inspired, she just copied Naruto's will because she had a childhood crush on him. Sakura was actually inspire by the effort and progress of her teammates and she developed her own will because her own desire not to be left behind and always in need of saving.",

Then when the Sand Shinobi interfered it wasn't even fair because it was established early on that they had already surpassed chunin level and were held back from taking the Chunin Exams on purpose.\n\nSo it wasn't too unrealistic when the Sound 4 got beat considering how many opponents they fought in short succession.

                    "body": "? Naruto learning an S rank jutsu had nothing to do with the nine tails and he was supposedly bad at ninjutsu at the time. Sasuke mastered fireball which used both form and an elemental release as a young child without the sharingan? Plus, Naruto beat kabuto without the nine tails who supposedly matched kakashi at the time. Also I didn\u2019t say the power scaling in the original Naruto was bad I said it was okay. Also Boruto supposedly trains just as hard now along with being a genius and having years of personal training from his parents who area again incredibly strong. I think the show probably shows this poorly as I generally don\u2019t think the actual delivery of Boruto is very good, just that it doesn\u2019t destroy the cannon power scaling. If your still reading this I also find it a little ironic that the people saying new team seven is way to op and beating god level opponents also say old team seven would completely crap on them in a fight. It just makes both arguments a little hard to agree with.",

It however, doesn't make a show inherently bad because of it. There are a lot more aspects in Boruto that make it worse than Naruto + Naruto Shippuden. I think the whole power scale thing is just used by mostly salty fans who don't have the right words (or intelligence in some cases) to argue the real problems with Boruto.",

If it was targeted at us they'd continue off where Shippuden left. If it was just a cash grab don't you think it'd be more profitable to do that instead of develop an entirely new cast of characters that you have to go through and develop? The risk is way too fucking high if it's just a cash grab. If the goal was just to make money, you'd continue off doing Naruto shit, with him as the main character.

They then were able to push the Sound 4 into using their second state and the Sound 4 admitted to being tired as well.\n\nAlso by that time in the story, it had been established that even though Shikamaru was the only one who had become a chunin, people like Neji, Naruto, and Sasuke had reached that level physically. Then when the Sand Shinobi interfered it wasn't even fair because it was established early on that they had already surpassed chunin level and were held back from taking the Chunin Exams on purpose.\n\nSo it wasn't too unrealistic when the Sound 4 got beat considering how many opponents they fought in short succession. Also, Choji and Neji almost died which shows that they weren't easy fights.",

Sasuke mastered fireball which used both form and an elemental release as a young child without the sharingan? Plus, Naruto beat kabuto without the nine tails who supposedly matched kakashi at the time. Also I didn\u2019t say the power scaling in the original Naruto was bad I said it was okay. Also Boruto supposedly trains just as hard now along with being a genius and having years of personal training from his parents who area again incredibly strong. I think the show probably shows this poorly as I generally don\u2019t think the actual delivery of Boruto is very good, just that it doesn\u2019t destroy the cannon power scaling. If your still reading this I also find it a little ironic that the people saying new team seven is way to op and beating god level opponents also say old team seven would completely crap on them in a fight. It just makes both arguments a little hard to agree with.",

If it was targeted at us they'd continue off where Shippuden left.

Kubo's next work (Burn the Witch) is set in the world of Bleach but focuses on completely different characters with different themes, settings, and powers. \n\nIt's not shoving Ichigo's son in front of you and saying \"Hey remember Ichigo? Here is his son and he'll fight even more powerful villains than Ichigo fought while we sideline Ichigo and vaguely foreshadow that he might die so that we can get people to care about it. Also, it's going to be about aliens and sci-fi rather than magic.\"\n\nAlso, I was trying my best to be polite here (I literally said it's fine if you like it) but it seems you don't respond to that well so have a nice day asshole and keep being delusional about a blatant cash grab.",

They then were able to push the Sound 4 into using their second state and the Sound 4 admitted to being tired as well.\n\nAlso by that time in the story, it had been established that even though Shikamaru was the only one who had become a chunin, people like Neji, Naruto, and Sasuke had reached that level physically. Then when the Sand Shinobi interfered it wasn't even fair because it was established early on that they had already surpassed chunin level and were held back from taking the Chunin Exams on purpose.\n\nSo it wasn't too unrealistic when the Sound 4 got beat considering how many opponents they fought in short succession. Also, Choji and Neji almost died which shows that they weren't easy fights.",

It is not 20 year olds or 30 year olds who grew up watching naruto. It's targeted to the kids who were are age when we started watching Naruto. If it was targeted at us they'd continue off where Shippuden left. If it was just a cash grab don't you think it'd be more profitable to do that instead of develop an entirely new cast of characters that you have to go through and develop? The risk is way too fucking high if it's just a cash grab. If the goal was just to make money, you'd continue off doing Naruto shit, with him as the main character. Not make a new IP with him as a side character. Damn.",

Kubo's next work (Burn the Witch) is set in the world of Bleach but focuses on completely different characters with different themes, settings, and powers. \n\nIt's not shoving Ichigo's son in front of you and saying \"Hey remember Ichigo?

That is probably the single most used desire/will for a Lancer or anti-hero type character. What makes it a compelling will and motivation for Sasuke is that it was formed due to his trauma and his own experiences  rather than copying someone else. \n\nHinata wasn't inspired, she just copied Naruto's will because she had a childhood crush on him. Sakura was actually inspire by the effort and progress of her teammates and she developed her own will because her own desire not to be left behind and always in need of saving.",

That's like 4 generations of inferior shinobi.\n\nThen Naruto and Sasuke literally become demi-gods which irreparably broke the power ceiling so now Boruto is going full DBZ where they give Boruto an Otsutsuki host because \"hey we gotta have something bigger than the Nine Tails\" even though it doesn't really make much sense. I bet Boruto's eye will also somehow be more powerful than the Rinnegan.",

Also, it's going to be about aliens and sci-fi rather than magic.\"\n\nAlso, I was trying my best to be polite here (I literally said it's fine if you like it) but it seems you don't respond to that well so have a nice day asshole and keep being delusional about a blatant cash grab.",

That is probably the single most used desire/will for a Lancer or anti-hero type character. What makes it a compelling will and motivation for Sasuke is that it was formed due to his trauma and his own experiences  rather than copying someone else. \n\nHinata wasn't inspired, she just copied Naruto's will because she had a childhood crush on him. Sakura was actually inspire by the effort and progress of her teammates and she developed her own will because her own desire not to be left behind and always in need of saving.",
