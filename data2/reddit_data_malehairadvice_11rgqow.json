Lol) run your fingers through it up and to the right, but like gradually, so the front is more to the side than say the middle or where the top meets the back of the side. Do that a few times until it\u2019s in a spot you like or can tolerate and give a lil jostle to the very front. So it sort of curls or hangs down. And just keep the sides sort of brushed/pushed backward or \u201cclean\u201d looking. Play with that to your liking and you\u2019ll have a decent look that\u2019s also versatile in how you dress. It also gets a loooot easier to style this way the more this grows out.\n\nGodspeed.",
