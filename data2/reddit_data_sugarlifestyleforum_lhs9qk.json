    "body": "\"But,but, it feels so transactional\" or \"I want a more natural feeling relationship\", or \" I am not comfortable talking about money\", or \" I don't want him to be turned off\". And the list goes on. We read posts every-single-day about SBs who are scammed and disrespected by con artists who talk them into beginning the \"arrangement\" with the expectation of allowance to be paid in the future. Don't be a statistic.  It is true that many SDs pay later and are honorable, but not at first. The SB needs the peace of mind that her new SD is taking care of her allowance. \n\nDo not take your clothes off before allowance is paid-PERIOD! I know it is uncomfortable having the money talk. But if you want to avoid the gut wrenching feeling of being conned, get over it.",

For one thing, I really don't want you in my bag (I won't go through your wallet either). I'd rather we just be upfront about it - not explicit like, \"here is your $\u201d while I count it. But at least before intimacy, leaving it in the same place every time and I just slip it in my bag myself in a casual way.\n\nHere's how I've done it:\n\nConvo before 1st intimate date about how to be paid.\n\nSD: Of course\n\n(At my arrival, envelope with cash and my name was on counter)\n\nMe: Is this for me?\n\nSD: (with a smile) Yes\n\nMe: Thank you.\n\n\n\nIf things *didn't* go this way, I would have no problem with a gentle reminder, \"I didn't seem to see my envelope\" or similar. \n\n(None of this occurred with an SD from SLF)",

Partially because I'm on the same page as you: I give your purse the same respect I expect you to give my wallet -- that is, hands off, period.  I also think all this spycraft reinforces that allowance is something to hide because it's a little... shameful?  something else?\n\nPersonal-style wise, I tend to like to de-awkwardize things by just bringing them up to the surface and handling them with warmth and humor.  I hand it to her in a little card, big smile, heartfelt thank her for being such amazing company, etc.  With respect, I find your \"have a little envelope for me, put it on the counter\" approach to be way too escort-evocative for me to love, THAT would make me feel awkward.  I'd just rather we look each other in the eye and make it a moment where I tell her how much I appreciate her, and it becomes a positive experience instead of an awkward one.  Handwritten note of appreciation inside.\n\nThis really only matters the first few dates anyway, after which the allowance is just part of the scenery.",

Another reason I'm not a fan.\n\nThe \"envelope of cash\" statement only happens once, and at the start. It's to establish 1) that I prefer allowance in cash and 2) to just get out of the way that I'm asking for it before intimacy vs after. That's the only time the convo happens. I could avoid having that convo but there's no way to know we're on the same page without it. If I *knew* an SD would treat things the way you do, the first and every time then sure, I wouldn't have to say anything. But in the early days, how else will we know how to set the tone moving forward?",

We're adults. The awkwardness, if any, literally tends to last less than 30 seconds, and by the 3rd date, it's gone completely.  I'll deal with feeling a little awkward if it makes my SB feel better; even the things in this thread that I've called out as making me feel awkward, frankly if that's what my SB asks for, I'll deal.  It's really not a huge deal for me to feel awkward for 15 seconds, especially given how amazing she's made me feel the past few hours at dinner, and the next couple of hours in private!",

That will scare A LOT of women away!\n\nWhen I start an arrangement, I will tell them that I don't want sex to feel forced.  They are welcome to come back to my place when they are comfortable, but they are not obligated to have sex.  We may just hang out, watch movies, make food and/or drinks.  I've had several platonic dates like this before we moved to intimate dates.   In these cases, I typically provide a $ gift like I do for most M&Gs at the end of the date.  I don't know, and she may not know, if we will have sex that night at the start of the date. \n\nSometimes, we have a discussion during the date and agree to have sex.  As we proceed back to the bedroom I will place the agreed upon allowance on a table or counter in clear view.  Other times, the chemistry and attraction is so strong, it happens spontaneously while chatting over drinks or watching a movie.  I've found it difficult to stop in the throws of passion to place the allowance in plain site.  These have genuinely been the best experiences that turned into the best arrangements.  \n\nTo be fair, we've probably already been on a platonic date or two where I have already given them a generous $ gift at the end of each date without discussion.  I've already built enough trust that they know I won't short them.  \n\nThe only times I've had to put an allowance in an envelope and placed it out for them at the start of an intimate date, is when we did not have previous platonic M&G's or additional platonic dates where I gifted them after each date.   I've only skipped M&G's early on in my sugar careeer with women that were clearly more professional and transactional where we had explicit sex for money only dates.  I now, avoid more professional women, never skip the platonic M&G, may have several platonic dates prior to intimacy and typically provide a $ gift after every platonic date.  By the time we are intimate, I've built credibility.",

            "body": "I'll volunteer as tribute to face the inevitable downvote storm, but I think there is some really important additional information SBs need to know.  The first thing is that I agree with u/GSSD that you as an SB are entitled to, and should, ask for your allowance before your clothes come off on the first date.  As an SD, on the first date, I give my new SB her allowance when we get to the room before she even asks; occasionally, I've taken the risk and just given it to her at the restaurant (many SDs who do this get ripped off so not something I recommend; I do it anyway, when our connection is spectacular).\n\nTHAT SAID.  It is important you realize this: giving the allowance before intimacy is an slf norm, but it is not the norm in the bowl.  The norm in the bowl is to give allowance afterwards.  I do not tell you this to discourage you from asking for it before -- in fact, I think you SHOULD ask for it before. **But don't be surprised if your SD is a bit shocked or momentarily taken aback at the request.**  An SD can go 10 years and many, many SBs, and never have heard an SB ask for allowance beforehand even once.  I have never been asked, ever.  Many many SDs here have said the same thing.\n\nNot every SD has read slf.  It is difficult to find a good SD (and at least as difficult to find a good SB), it's important you don't see red flags where there are none.  It is not a red flag if your SD, who has probably never read SLF, has never been asked for allowance in advance, and pauses for a moment.  It's also not any kind of flag if he isn't the first one to bring up the allowance discussion (although he should not be evasive once you bring it up).   A subset of good SDs will do all these things for you -- bring up allowance themselves, give you the allowance before intimacy without you even asking.  A subset of good SDs won't -- but the point is, they can still be good SDs.   Don't imagine red flags where there aren't any.",

It was... around the beginning, after I had settled in and ordered a cocktail. He said it was an extra thank you for coming so elegantly put together. (I\u2019m in my early 30\u2019s so my style is a bit more sexy/elegant/sophisticated/refined instead of cute college student).\n\nYes I\u2019ve been gifted on platonic dates. And like I said before, I HONESTLY don\u2019t get the SFL insistance on differentiating between platonic and intimate dates. If you\u2019re doing ppm it\u2019s pay per MEET not pay per sex act. \n\nAnd yes, if you\u2019re getting to know one another and have multiple platonic dates a gift at the end will go a huge way to building up trust. If you don\u2019t want an escort don\u2019t treat her like one by insisting on not gifting unless there\u2019s intimacy on the date. Otherwise you\u2019re basically telling her \u201cyou don\u2019t get a thing until you fuck me.\u201d And that just feels gross. This subreddit seems to have a general cognitive dissonance about that. It also prevents putting your SB in the horribly awkward position of trying to figure out if you\u2019re legit or not.\n\n*Note: I am extremely feminine. So I tend to attract men that like that. I\u2019m gifted at the start of dates and one of the reasons why is possibly because men LOVE seeing my reaction to being gifted and treated well. THEY can\u2019t wait to gift me. It was even turned into a game at one point with one of my SDs. \u201cIt\u2019s hiding somewhere in this room, I\u2019ll give you a clue.\u201d And then you drink wine and have a mini scavenger hunt. But the key to this is that I make a HUGE production about finding it. It was a fun game so I TELL them it was fun. I TELL them how clever they are. I laugh, I bounce, I clap my hands, and I kiss them as a thank you. But the key is that it\u2019s NOT an act. I LOVE being pampered, spoiled, and taken care of. And I expect to be treated well in Vanilla relationships as well. So I don\u2019t NEED the money to be this super subtle thing because I don\u2019t consider it as taboo. And if it doesn\u2019t need to be subtle it allows me to show a man full appreciation for what he\u2019s doing for me. And that overt appreciation taps into something they love and need.",

That\u2019s not an opinion it\u2019s fact based on wording of the law. It\u2019s like agreeing to have sex with a condom and then slipping it off without her knowledge.

I think the best thing is to have a discussion before the intimate date. Say something like \" (Pot daddy), I'm really excited(blah blah) but I would appreciate it if you would indulge me when we have our sexy date (tomorrow). Would you mind putting my allowance on the bureau before we get intimate? I don't want to be a nervous Nellie but I'm so afraid we'll get so wrapped up in all the fun that we will forget all about it. Thanks for being understanding!\"  So what are you going to do if he says \"Oh, I won't forget\" and he does not put it out for you?  That's when you say \" Do you have something for me --?\"",

Expect he might be surprised when you do.  Don't panic, it's not a red flag, but hold your ground.  He should give you your PPM.\n\nThat's it.  I'm not suggesting \"don't ask for your PPM beforehand\".  I am suggesting, against the advice of others on this thread, that it's very likely he's never been asked this before and doesn't have the slightest idea that we here on slf have decided it's a norm.

When I mentioned as one of my justifications for not consistently doing so, \"listen, no SB ever asks for it beforehand anyway; that must mean they don't care much either way\".  These SBs told me, \"nope, that's not it.  she isn't asking beforehand because it's so incredibly awkward, every way she frames it in her head sounds terrible, and she's terrified of how you'll react -- so terrified, she'd rather risk you scamming her rather than asking.  But EVERY SB wishes you'd give it beforehand\".   Made sense to me.  \n\nNo SB has ever asked me, so I can't say from experience what would be great.  I know \"do you have something for me\" is the exact phrase we hear from escorts, and from the stripper once we get to the champagne room, so wouldn't be my favorite coming from my SB, I suppose.  Still, I'm a grown man and would get over my 3 seconds of discomfort regardless.\n\nIn my imagination, I'd react really positively to her coming close, looking almost embarrassed she has to ask, and \"Would you mind if we handled the allowance now so I know it's out of the way and just have fun?\"   I really don't know if someone else is going to tell me how cringy that is, but it'd sound fine to me.",

I always just gave her the PPM before hand - first time was in a card, the second time she sat down, was talking about her day, I got her a glass of water, kissed her, and dropped it in her purse. Again, it was hours of totally unbelievable fun after that. \n\nThen came visit three. Something at the beginning felt, I dunno, \"off\". At that point I think I was more concerned with trying to figure out what was bugging her than anything else, and was like \"maybe a full body massage will help ya think better?\" and went to lead her upstairs and she grunted.\n\nI was like, \"huh?\" and she made a gesture of pointing to her purse and did a cutesy little cat meow or whatever. Took me a second to realize it, then was like, \"Oh, I'm sorry\" and the money was right there next to her, so I picked it up and put it in her purse - and then we went upstairs. \n\nAt the time I didn't think about it, but I'll be damned if it wasn't starting to bother the bejeesus out of me. But again, didn't really pay much attention to it.\n\nAfter that - I texted her and she was very, very aloof and then ultimately ghosted me for two weeks. \n\nShe came back, rather busted up that she had met another SD and he totally and completely \"scammed\" her. Promised her the moon and delivered nothing but dick. Literally. We weren't exclusive, so I chose to meet her for dinner and it was like I was talking to a completely different person. \n\nOn that third date when she did that, it really bugged the crap outta me. Ultimately I didn't see her again, cuz, well she had made some decisions with SD#2 that totally defied logic and common sense, but even some of those I would have worked through - but the not budging from the seat before cash on intimate date #3 - (with many hours in between texting, talking, pics of all kinds of stuff, acting like friends, etc.) that one stung. \n\nI understand it I guess - but dammit it stung. It brought home the total facade of the lifestyle.",

We're adults. The awkwardness, if any, literally tends to last less than 30 seconds, and by the 3rd date, it's gone completely.  I'll deal with feeling a little awkward if it makes my SB feel better; even the things in this thread that I've called out as making me feel awkward, frankly if that's what my SB asks for, I'll deal.  It's really not a huge deal for me to feel awkward for 15 seconds, especially given how amazing she's made me feel the past few hours at dinner, and the next couple of hours in private!",

It was... around the beginning, after I had settled in and ordered a cocktail. He said it was an extra thank you for coming so elegantly put together. (I\u2019m in my early 30\u2019s so my style is a bit more sexy/elegant/sophisticated/refined instead of cute college student).\n\nYes I\u2019ve been gifted on platonic dates. And like I said before, I HONESTLY don\u2019t get the SFL insistance on differentiating between platonic and intimate dates. If you\u2019re doing ppm it\u2019s pay per MEET not pay per sex act. \n\nAnd yes, if you\u2019re getting to know one another and have multiple platonic dates a gift at the end will go a huge way to building up trust. If you don\u2019t want an escort don\u2019t treat her like one by insisting on not gifting unless there\u2019s intimacy on the date. Otherwise you\u2019re basically telling her \u201cyou don\u2019t get a thing until you fuck me.\u201d And that just feels gross. This subreddit seems to have a general cognitive dissonance about that. It also prevents putting your SB in the horribly awkward position of trying to figure out if you\u2019re legit or not.\n\n*Note: I am extremely feminine. So I tend to attract men that like that. I\u2019m gifted at the start of dates and one of the reasons why is possibly because men LOVE seeing my reaction to being gifted and treated well. THEY can\u2019t wait to gift me. It was even turned into a game at one point with one of my SDs. \u201cIt\u2019s hiding somewhere in this room, I\u2019ll give you a clue.\u201d And then you drink wine and have a mini scavenger hunt. But the key to this is that I make a HUGE production about finding it. It was a fun game so I TELL them it was fun. I TELL them how clever they are. I laugh, I bounce, I clap my hands, and I kiss them as a thank you. But the key is that it\u2019s NOT an act. I LOVE being pampered, spoiled, and taken care of. And I expect to be treated well in Vanilla relationships as well. So I don\u2019t NEED the money to be this super subtle thing because I don\u2019t consider it as taboo. And if it doesn\u2019t need to be subtle it allows me to show a man full appreciation for what he\u2019s doing for me. And that overt appreciation taps into something they love and need.",

That\u2019s not an opinion it\u2019s fact based on wording of the law. It\u2019s like agreeing to have sex with a condom and then slipping it off without her knowledge.

When I mentioned as one of my justifications for not consistently doing so, \"listen, no SB ever asks for it beforehand anyway; that must mean they don't care much either way\".  These SBs told me, \"nope, that's not it.  she isn't asking beforehand because it's so incredibly awkward, every way she frames it in her head sounds terrible, and she's terrified of how you'll react -- so terrified, she'd rather risk you scamming her rather than asking.  But EVERY SB wishes you'd give it beforehand\".   Made sense to me.  \n\nNo SB has ever asked me, so I can't say from experience what would be great.  I know \"do you have something for me\" is the exact phrase we hear from escorts, and from the stripper once we get to the champagne room, so wouldn't be my favorite coming from my SB, I suppose.  Still, I'm a grown man and would get over my 3 seconds of discomfort regardless.\n\nIn my imagination, I'd react really positively to her coming close, looking almost embarrassed she has to ask, and \"Would you mind if we handled the allowance now so I know it's out of the way and just have fun?\"   I really don't know if someone else is going to tell me how cringy that is, but it'd sound fine to me.",

I always just gave her the PPM before hand - first time was in a card, the second time she sat down, was talking about her day, I got her a glass of water, kissed her, and dropped it in her purse. Again, it was hours of totally unbelievable fun after that. \n\nThen came visit three. Something at the beginning felt, I dunno, \"off\". At that point I think I was more concerned with trying to figure out what was bugging her than anything else, and was like \"maybe a full body massage will help ya think better?\" and went to lead her upstairs and she grunted.\n\nI was like, \"huh?\" and she made a gesture of pointing to her purse and did a cutesy little cat meow or whatever. Took me a second to realize it, then was like, \"Oh, I'm sorry\" and the money was right there next to her, so I picked it up and put it in her purse - and then we went upstairs. \n\nAt the time I didn't think about it, but I'll be damned if it wasn't starting to bother the bejeesus out of me. But again, didn't really pay much attention to it.\n\nAfter that - I texted her and she was very, very aloof and then ultimately ghosted me for two weeks. \n\nShe came back, rather busted up that she had met another SD and he totally and completely \"scammed\" her. Promised her the moon and delivered nothing but dick. Literally. We weren't exclusive, so I chose to meet her for dinner and it was like I was talking to a completely different person. \n\nOn that third date when she did that, it really bugged the crap outta me. Ultimately I didn't see her again, cuz, well she had made some decisions with SD#2 that totally defied logic and common sense, but even some of those I would have worked through - but the not budging from the seat before cash on intimate date #3 - (with many hours in between texting, talking, pics of all kinds of stuff, acting like friends, etc.) that one stung. \n\nI understand it I guess - but dammit it stung. It brought home the total facade of the lifestyle.",

I could avoid having that convo but there's no way to know we're on the same page without it.

We're adults. The awkwardness, if any, literally tends to last less than 30 seconds, and by the 3rd date, it's gone completely.  I'll deal with feeling a little awkward if it makes my SB feel better; even the things in this thread that I've called out as making me feel awkward, frankly if that's what my SB asks for, I'll deal.  It's really not a huge deal for me to feel awkward for 15 seconds, especially given how amazing she's made me feel the past few hours at dinner, and the next couple of hours in private!",

It was... around the beginning, after I had settled in and ordered a cocktail. He said it was an extra thank you for coming so elegantly put together. (I\u2019m in my early 30\u2019s so my style is a bit more sexy/elegant/sophisticated/refined instead of cute college student).\n\nYes I\u2019ve been gifted on platonic dates. And like I said before, I HONESTLY don\u2019t get the SFL insistance on differentiating between platonic and intimate dates. If you\u2019re doing ppm it\u2019s pay per MEET not pay per sex act. \n\nAnd yes, if you\u2019re getting to know one another and have multiple platonic dates a gift at the end will go a huge way to building up trust. If you don\u2019t want an escort don\u2019t treat her like one by insisting on not gifting unless there\u2019s intimacy on the date. Otherwise you\u2019re basically telling her \u201cyou don\u2019t get a thing until you fuck me.\u201d And that just feels gross. This subreddit seems to have a general cognitive dissonance about that. It also prevents putting your SB in the horribly awkward position of trying to figure out if you\u2019re legit or not.\n\n*Note: I am extremely feminine. So I tend to attract men that like that. I\u2019m gifted at the start of dates and one of the reasons why is possibly because men LOVE seeing my reaction to being gifted and treated well. THEY can\u2019t wait to gift me. It was even turned into a game at one point with one of my SDs. \u201cIt\u2019s hiding somewhere in this room, I\u2019ll give you a clue.\u201d And then you drink wine and have a mini scavenger hunt. But the key to this is that I make a HUGE production about finding it. It was a fun game so I TELL them it was fun. I TELL them how clever they are. I laugh, I bounce, I clap my hands, and I kiss them as a thank you. But the key is that it\u2019s NOT an act. I LOVE being pampered, spoiled, and taken care of. And I expect to be treated well in Vanilla relationships as well. So I don\u2019t NEED the money to be this super subtle thing because I don\u2019t consider it as taboo. And if it doesn\u2019t need to be subtle it allows me to show a man full appreciation for what he\u2019s doing for me. And that overt appreciation taps into something they love and need.",

When a pot SD pumps and dumps under the guise of \u201cI\u2019ll pay you after\u201d it\u2019s sexual assault. That\u2019s not an opinion it\u2019s fact based on wording of the law.

These SBs told me, \"nope, that's not it.  she isn't asking beforehand because it's so incredibly awkward, every way she frames it in her head sounds terrible, and she's terrified of how you'll react -- so terrified, she'd rather risk you scamming her rather than asking.

We're adults. The awkwardness, if any, literally tends to last less than 30 seconds, and by the 3rd date, it's gone completely.  I'll deal with feeling a little awkward if it makes my SB feel better; even the things in this thread that I've called out as making me feel awkward, frankly if that's what my SB asks for, I'll deal.  It's really not a huge deal for me to feel awkward for 15 seconds, especially given how amazing she's made me feel the past few hours at dinner, and the next couple of hours in private!",

It was... around the beginning, after I had settled in and ordered a cocktail. He said it was an extra thank you for coming so elegantly put together. (I\u2019m in my early 30\u2019s so my style is a bit more sexy/elegant/sophisticated/refined instead of cute college student).\n\nYes I\u2019ve been gifted on platonic dates. And like I said before, I HONESTLY don\u2019t get the SFL insistance on differentiating between platonic and intimate dates. If you\u2019re doing ppm it\u2019s pay per MEET not pay per sex act. \n\nAnd yes, if you\u2019re getting to know one another and have multiple platonic dates a gift at the end will go a huge way to building up trust. If you don\u2019t want an escort don\u2019t treat her like one by insisting on not gifting unless there\u2019s intimacy on the date. Otherwise you\u2019re basically telling her \u201cyou don\u2019t get a thing until you fuck me.\u201d And that just feels gross. This subreddit seems to have a general cognitive dissonance about that. It also prevents putting your SB in the horribly awkward position of trying to figure out if you\u2019re legit or not.\n\n*Note: I am extremely feminine. So I tend to attract men that like that. I\u2019m gifted at the start of dates and one of the reasons why is possibly because men LOVE seeing my reaction to being gifted and treated well. THEY can\u2019t wait to gift me. It was even turned into a game at one point with one of my SDs. \u201cIt\u2019s hiding somewhere in this room, I\u2019ll give you a clue.\u201d And then you drink wine and have a mini scavenger hunt. But the key to this is that I make a HUGE production about finding it. It was a fun game so I TELL them it was fun. I TELL them how clever they are. I laugh, I bounce, I clap my hands, and I kiss them as a thank you. But the key is that it\u2019s NOT an act. I LOVE being pampered, spoiled, and taken care of. And I expect to be treated well in Vanilla relationships as well. So I don\u2019t NEED the money to be this super subtle thing because I don\u2019t consider it as taboo. And if it doesn\u2019t need to be subtle it allows me to show a man full appreciation for what he\u2019s doing for me. And that overt appreciation taps into something they love and need.",

When a pot SD pumps and dumps under the guise of \u201cI\u2019ll pay you after\u201d it\u2019s sexual assault. That\u2019s not an opinion it\u2019s fact based on wording of the law.

When I mentioned as one of my justifications for not consistently doing so, \"listen, no SB ever asks for it beforehand anyway; that must mean they don't care much either way\".  These SBs told me, \"nope, that's not it.  she isn't asking beforehand because it's so incredibly awkward, every way she frames it in her head sounds terrible, and she's terrified of how you'll react -- so terrified, she'd rather risk you scamming her rather than asking.  But EVERY SB wishes you'd give it beforehand\".   Made sense to me.  \n\nNo SB has ever asked me, so I can't say from experience what would be great.  I know \"do you have something for me\" is the exact phrase we hear from escorts, and from the stripper once we get to the champagne room, so wouldn't be my favorite coming from my SB, I suppose.  Still, I'm a grown man and would get over my 3 seconds of discomfort regardless.\n\nIn my imagination, I'd react really positively to her coming close, looking almost embarrassed she has to ask, and \"Would you mind if we handled the allowance now so I know it's out of the way and just have fun?\"   I really don't know if someone else is going to tell me how cringy that is, but it'd sound fine to me.",

When a pot SD pumps and dumps under the guise of \u201cI\u2019ll pay you after\u201d it\u2019s sexual assault. That\u2019s not an opinion it\u2019s fact based on wording of the law.

These SBs told me, \"nope, that's not it.  she isn't asking beforehand because it's so incredibly awkward, every way she frames it in her head sounds terrible, and she's terrified of how you'll react -- so terrified, she'd rather risk you scamming her rather than asking.

I know \"do you have something for me\" is the exact phrase we hear from escorts, and from the stripper once we get to the champagne room, so wouldn't be my favorite coming from my SB, I suppose.  Still, I'm a grown man and would get over my 3 seconds of discomfort regardless.\n\nIn my imagination, I'd react really positively to her coming close, looking almost embarrassed she has to ask, and \"Would you mind if we handled the allowance now so I know it's out of the way and just have fun?\"   I really don't know if someone else is going to tell me how cringy that is, but it'd sound fine to me.",

When a pot SD pumps and dumps under the guise of \u201cI\u2019ll pay you after\u201d it\u2019s sexual assault. That\u2019s not an opinion it\u2019s fact based on wording of the law. It\u2019s like agreeing to have sex with a condom and then slipping it off without her knowledge. That\u2019s sexual assault, not just \u201cbeing a jerk\u201d.\n\nSo again I say, the risk to the woman is WAY higher than the risk to the man. The safety of our body and consequently future mental and emotional health is more important than the safety to your wallet.\n\nUse discernment. Have frank open conversations.
