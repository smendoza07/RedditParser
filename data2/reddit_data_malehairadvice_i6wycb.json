Your hair isn't supposed to be flat and fluffy, that's not its natural state. It's not supposed to be greasy either but there is a middle route. If you stop washing your hair with sulphates and silicone and then only wash it once a week, you will most likely be able to achieve this look literally with 0 product. My hair is like this when I've gone to bed with wet hair and so the lack of down-pushing gravity allows it to get a height. This guy's hair is most likely simply well-kept hair with a little product (paste, gel, mousse, whatever) and maybe some hairspray. \n\nEdit: Bear in mind this hairstyle looks great on photos but is hard to \"keep\" throughout the day. If you use the right product or your own natural \"product\" then it'll want to hold that shape all day but any disturbance will cause it to change its form. Wind is out of your control and will be your worst enemy if you want to look the exact same throughout the day. What ends up happening is your hair will looks slightly different constantly throughout the day. Some people might think it's a little \"messy\" because of that.",

If you use conditioner without silicone (not that hard to  get, not expensive, just random what conditioners have and don't have silicone) then the conditioner will completely clean your hair but won't dry it out as much as shampoo. \n\nBasically what I do is I wash my hair in the non-silicone conditioner (I use Tresemme Expert Botanique with Coconut and Aloe Vera) like I would with shampoo. So a complete douse, then rub it in as if you're actually cleaning it with your fingers, then 100% rinse it. Then you apply the same conditioner as well but don't wash everything out. You leave some in. Now the % to leave in is individual so it just takes some experimentation.\n\nThis is probably not the best way to co-wash and there are many other products I could ise to care for my hair but I like the fact that it can stay clean looking for weeks and weeks without a wash. When you shower normally you can douse your hair and rub it without any conditioner and you will steal clean it somewhat.\n\nEdit: this may not work as well if you use certain products. Basically the conditioner cannot clean silicone, so that's why the conditioner itself doesn't have silicone. If you use a styling product with silicone then obviously it would heap up over time and make your hair greasy. I don't use any product at all, except maybe on special occasions. Definitely not daily.",

Slick Gorilla is the brand I use to achieve this style, but as it's a fairly common new product there are a few brands out there.\n\nI love using powder over literally any kind of pomade, clay, wax, etc. It holds better, is easier to manage, and since it's matte it doesn't leave a shiny greasy look.\n\nPlus it's water soluble! Application is easy. Just sprinkle it over your hair when dry, tossle with your hands a bit, and you're done",

You need some kind of texturing product, I personally used a combination of low-hold texture powder and high-hold matte-finish clay. Keep in mind that the volume will most definitely be the hardest to maintain throughout the day, I could only keep it like this for maybe 3-4 hours post-styling at the max.\n\nFor styling, I would start by towel-drying my hair, and then blow-drying on medium-high heat with a round brush. I applied the texture powder when there was barely any moisture left, and ran the blowdryer through once more on the same heat setting. Then I would apply the clay and blowdry once more on a cold setting.  When applying the clay and blowdrying cold, I used my fingers instead of the brush to create a more rough and textured look. From there you can move certain strands around so it looks like it's falling in your face.",
