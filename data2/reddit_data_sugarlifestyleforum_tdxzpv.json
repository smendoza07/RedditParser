    "body": "Yesterday, I went on a date with a POT who I\u2019ve had a few conversations with and FaceTimed. He made reservations at a really nice restaurant in the DC area that I\u2019ve been to before with friends. So, I was pretty excited. He arrived late because he went to a nearby bar to have a drink (he said he was nervous),looked like he just woke up (date was at 4pm), and I suspected he was a bit tipsy. He did bring me a gift that I did not ask for. I\u2019m pretty down to earth and so I was thinking  \u2026 okay, let\u2019s just see how this goes and try to have fun anyways. \n\nThe whole date, he was complimenting me and while I do think I am hot/beautiful\u2026 his comments ranged from nice to incredibly inappropriate given the setting. For example, he told me that my boobs were even better than he imagined and asked what my nipples looked like WHILE I tried to eat a radish. \n\nIt gets worst - \n\nI notice his fly is down and i mention it. He starts telling me how sexy I am and I\u2019m thinking he\u2019s pulling up his fly for a while now and maybe it\u2019s just stuck ? But he\u2019s doing this while staring at me. This takes like a few minutes which in retrospect, I should\u2019ve known something was off \u2026 Anyways, while doing this he\u2019s looking at me and complimenting my skin, eyes, and lips (I\u2019m black with green eyes) THEN he lets out a soft moan and I kid you not CAME IN HIS PANTS. He apologized and I was so uncomfortable. \n\nLiterally worst date I\u2019ve ever been on in my life \ud83d\ude2d.",
