But shikamaru also hasn\u2019t faced anybody as smart as him in the show either. His strongest opponent was probably Hidan and that dude was a fucking idiot, but I don\u2019t think shikamaru would be nerfed as much if he was to lose shadow possession.\n\nThere\u2019s probably someone out there who knows or remembers more of the show than I, that could do a more technical analysis but idk I think it would be a pretty equal fight between the two",

He had only been back for about a day, after all. So I always took that to mean that he based that assessment on his friends' stats pre-timeskip. Naruto's assessment was most likely accurate if it was about his 12-13 year old friends, but probably isn't true anymore at the start of Shippuden. \n\nAfter all, Shippuden Sasuke's mastery of his Sharingan was great enough to allow him to escape Itachi's Tsukuyomi and Kakashi himself was highly impressed by the strategy Shikamaru thought up for their fight against Hidan and Kakuzu, so those two have definitely surpassed Kakashi in their specific specialties (though probably not yet as ninja overall, though that's debatable in Sasuke's case).",

Imagine Itachi using susano in a dense forest area or hill area, he won't get a clear vision of his opponents\n\nAnd btw this post was a battle royale, so there might be a chance he will let other fight and wait for the perfect moment\n\nHaving muscle won't do anything in front of brain",

Minato had no ninja background yet still scored the absolute highest scores in history. Additionally, Itachi graduated early due to exceptional performance, we know Minato kept to himself in school based on him and Kushina\u2019s youth. He didn\u2019t do anything flashy, but he was able to take out an entire platoon of Jonin ninja singlehandedly in seconds without using a single jutsu as a genin. Graduation age doesn\u2019t really matter all that much. Naruto got held back four times yet graduated the same age as Sasuke, who\u2019s supposed to be a genius. Obito was basically useless but graduated the same age as Kakashi. Jiraiya graduated at six, a year younger than Itachi. Boruto graduated at Naruto\u2019s age but already had 3 chakra transformations and had developed multiple jutsu. Same with Mitsuki, who graduated at Boruto\u2019s age but already had perfect Sage mode and mastered two chakra transformations. Shisui isn\u2019t even in the conversation about best academy student but he was a Jonin at age 11, Itachi only made Anbu at age 13. Graduation age means literally nothing. And don\u2019t bring up something like Itachi having the fastest Chunin clear time. Minato was held back by a team, Itachi wasn\u2019t. Gaara surpassed Itachi\u2019s time, and Gaara basically solo\u2019d the Forest of Death, so really strong single team Shinobi have an obvious advantage  to three man teams.",

He also outplayed Kabuto's mind control and reversed his reanimation jutsu. He also found Nagato's jutsu's one weakness that allowed him to seal Nagato.\n\nKakashi is said to be smarter than Shikamaru, but not as smart as Minato.\n\nShikamaru has the highest confirmed IQ and like other users have said, he would be smart enough not to drag himself into this fight. He understands he is basically the weakest compared to these legends.\n\nThis would be an insane close call match. Minato is someone who will work best under pressure and think of a quick easy plan in mere seconds. Shikamaru will be the one who probably plans out the whole fight from start to finish. Kakashi will be smart enough to know not to go overboard with his moves unless he is cornered. Itachi will find each one's weakness and exploit it. In terms of pure power the fight goes to Minato or Itachi, for pure smarts then I simply can't say. This is definitely a tough sick match up, it's like asking who is smarter Light Yagami or L?",

But shikamaru also hasn\u2019t faced anybody as smart as him in the show either. His strongest opponent was probably Hidan and that dude was a fucking idiot, but I don\u2019t think shikamaru would be nerfed as much if he was to lose shadow possession.\n\nThere\u2019s probably someone out there who knows or remembers more of the show than I, that could do a more technical analysis but idk I think it would be a pretty equal fight between the two",

He had only been back for about a day, after all. So I always took that to mean that he based that assessment on his friends' stats pre-timeskip. Naruto's assessment was most likely accurate if it was about his 12-13 year old friends, but probably isn't true anymore at the start of Shippuden. \n\nAfter all, Shippuden Sasuke's mastery of his Sharingan was great enough to allow him to escape Itachi's Tsukuyomi and Kakashi himself was highly impressed by the strategy Shikamaru thought up for their fight against Hidan and Kakuzu, so those two have definitely surpassed Kakashi in their specific specialties (though probably not yet as ninja overall, though that's debatable in Sasuke's case).",

And for Minato, minato is fast so he have to look out for those kunai. \n\nAs I have said before environment also plays a vital role in any match.

Minato had no ninja background yet still scored the absolute highest scores in history. Additionally, Itachi graduated early due to exceptional performance, we know Minato kept to himself in school based on him and Kushina\u2019s youth. He didn\u2019t do anything flashy, but he was able to take out an entire platoon of Jonin ninja singlehandedly in seconds without using a single jutsu as a genin. Graduation age doesn\u2019t really matter all that much. Naruto got held back four times yet graduated the same age as Sasuke, who\u2019s supposed to be a genius. Obito was basically useless but graduated the same age as Kakashi. Jiraiya graduated at six, a year younger than Itachi. Boruto graduated at Naruto\u2019s age but already had 3 chakra transformations and had developed multiple jutsu. Same with Mitsuki, who graduated at Boruto\u2019s age but already had perfect Sage mode and mastered two chakra transformations. Shisui isn\u2019t even in the conversation about best academy student but he was a Jonin at age 11, Itachi only made Anbu at age 13. Graduation age means literally nothing. And don\u2019t bring up something like Itachi having the fastest Chunin clear time. Minato was held back by a team, Itachi wasn\u2019t. Gaara surpassed Itachi\u2019s time, and Gaara basically solo\u2019d the Forest of Death, so really strong single team Shinobi have an obvious advantage  to three man teams.",

But shikamaru also hasn\u2019t faced anybody as smart as him in the show either. His strongest opponent was probably Hidan and that dude was a fucking idiot, but I don\u2019t think shikamaru would be nerfed as much if he was to lose shadow possession.\n\nThere\u2019s probably someone out there who knows or remembers more of the show than I, that could do a more technical analysis but idk I think it would be a pretty equal fight between the two",

He had only been back for about a day, after all. So I always took that to mean that he based that assessment on his friends' stats pre-timeskip. Naruto's assessment was most likely accurate if it was about his 12-13 year old friends, but probably isn't true anymore at the start of Shippuden. \n\nAfter all, Shippuden Sasuke's mastery of his Sharingan was great enough to allow him to escape Itachi's Tsukuyomi and Kakashi himself was highly impressed by the strategy Shikamaru thought up for their fight against Hidan and Kakuzu, so those two have definitely surpassed Kakashi in their specific specialties (though probably not yet as ninja overall, though that's debatable in Sasuke's case).",

And for Minato, minato is fast so he have to look out for those kunai. \n\nAs I have said before environment also plays a vital role in any match. Imagine Itachi using susano in a dense forest area or hill area, he won't get a clear vision of his opponents\n\nAnd btw this post was a battle royale, so there might be a chance he will let other fight and wait for the perfect moment\n\nHaving muscle won't do anything in front of brain",

Additionally, Itachi graduated early due to exceptional performance, we know Minato kept to himself in school based on him and Kushina\u2019s youth. He didn\u2019t do anything flashy, but he was able to take out an entire platoon of Jonin ninja singlehandedly in seconds without using a single jutsu as a genin. Graduation age doesn\u2019t really matter all that much. Naruto got held back four times yet graduated the same age as Sasuke, who\u2019s supposed to be a genius. Obito was basically useless but graduated the same age as Kakashi. Jiraiya graduated at six, a year younger than Itachi. Boruto graduated at Naruto\u2019s age but already had 3 chakra transformations and had developed multiple jutsu. Same with Mitsuki, who graduated at Boruto\u2019s age but already had perfect Sage mode and mastered two chakra transformations. Shisui isn\u2019t even in the conversation about best academy student but he was a Jonin at age 11, Itachi only made Anbu at age 13. Graduation age means literally nothing. And don\u2019t bring up something like Itachi having the fastest Chunin clear time. Minato was held back by a team, Itachi wasn\u2019t. Gaara surpassed Itachi\u2019s time, and Gaara basically solo\u2019d the Forest of Death, so really strong single team Shinobi have an obvious advantage  to three man teams.",

He had only been back for about a day, after all. So I always took that to mean that he based that assessment on his friends' stats pre-timeskip. Naruto's assessment was most likely accurate if it was about his 12-13 year old friends, but probably isn't true anymore at the start of Shippuden. \n\nAfter all, Shippuden Sasuke's mastery of his Sharingan was great enough to allow him to escape Itachi's Tsukuyomi and Kakashi himself was highly impressed by the strategy Shikamaru thought up for their fight against Hidan and Kakuzu, so those two have definitely surpassed Kakashi in their specific specialties (though probably not yet as ninja overall, though that's debatable in Sasuke's case).",

Imagine Itachi using susano in a dense forest area or hill area, he won't get a clear vision of his opponents\n\nAnd btw this post was a battle royale, so there might be a chance he will let other fight and wait for the perfect moment\n\nHaving muscle won't do anything in front of brain",

Imagine Itachi using susano in a dense forest area or hill area, he won't get a clear vision of his opponents\n\nAnd btw this post was a battle royale, so there might be a chance he will let other fight and wait for the perfect moment\n\nHaving muscle won't do anything in front of brain",

Imagine Itachi using susano in a dense forest area or hill area, he won't get a clear vision of his opponents\n\nAnd btw this post was a battle royale, so there might be a chance he will let other fight and wait for the perfect moment\n\nHaving muscle won't do anything in front of brain",

In the first fight with Hidan or fight with Tayuya with cursed mark stage 2, he lost because they pulled out something he knew nothing about.

Then itachi praises him and pulls out his amaterasu and he is dead. \n\nSame goes with Minato. He does something crazy to save himself against flying raijin. But then Minato places a seal on him and uses the flying raijin part 2 and he is dead.",

And for Minato, minato is fast so he have to look out for those kunai. \n\nAs I have said before environment also plays a vital role in any match. Imagine Itachi using susano in a dense forest area or hill area, he won't get a clear vision of his opponents\n\nAnd btw this post was a battle royale, so there might be a chance he will let other fight and wait for the perfect moment\n\nHaving muscle won't do anything in front of brain",

Like Itachi killed his gf with a genjutsu, Sasuke made Danzo his bitch with basic genjutsu, Shisui's op genjutsu,.. It really depends on what you see as a good genjutsu feat plus maybe Bee was just wrong by assuming that a perfect jinchuriki couldn't be genjutsued.. I mean Sakura did think she was on the same level as Naruto and Sasuke lmfao",

He will lose if he fight with them without knowing about them. \n\nBut scenarios can be different if he knows beforehand about the jutsus. Like for itachi he has to be sure that he doesn't see his eyes and counter him with the help of the environment. And for Minato, minato is fast so he have to look out for those kunai. \n\nAs I have said before environment also plays a vital role in any match. Imagine Itachi using susano in a dense forest area or hill area, he won't get a clear vision of his opponents\n\nAnd btw this post was a battle royale, so there might be a chance he will let other fight and wait for the perfect moment\n\nHaving muscle won't do anything in front of brain",
