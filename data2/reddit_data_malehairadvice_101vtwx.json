I have quite a few students with this haircut now, and most of them are good kids just trying to figure out life. I don't think they deserve to be made fun of, even abstractly online. \n\nThere are so many reasons to be legitimately critical of people, their words and behaviors.

Baseing my evidence off first hand acounts from middle school to high school. If you shame them than you better have a haircut that compliments your face shape. Haveing s haircut that compliments your face shape is the single most attractive thing you have control over as a man besides your body.",

But I still want somebody to explain to me the process that leads to me seeing this cut hundreds of times every day, usually on really young people. Are they ALL perming their hair? If so, how often? How time consuming is this style?\n\nAlso, where did it start? People credit its popularity to TikTok but did any specific influencer introduce it into the mainstream? It looks like the hair the Paul brothers had forever, so if I had to guess I\u2019d think it were them.\n\nOverall, while I don\u2019t particularly like it I DO like that Gen Z boys now have their own distinct style. It\u2019s like a rite of passage for any generation. Who cares if they\u2019ll cringe at it 20 years from now? I genuinely feel like that\u2019s part of the fun when it comes to styles.",
