The way you position the camera is the least flattering angle, regardless of how goofy your hair is. \n\nJust from what I can see, I would just suggest you push your hair back if you are trying to grow it out. It\u2019s too long to be voluminous in that way and not look like a character from a movie in the 90\u2019s starring Pauly Shore. \n\nIf you aren\u2019t growing it, I suggest a hair cut, and using matte clay to do a messy look. Tell your barber to be a bit \u201cchoppy\u201d so you can have some texture to it. \n\nThat way you can do the volume look and have it be a bit more modern, no part. You have a GREAT head of hair, just your execution is a bit off. \n\nEveryone else, this fella came here for advice. It\u2019s the name of the sub. Your comments are all hilarious, but I don\u2019t think they are in the spirit of being constructive.",

And I'd probably try to shower an hour before bed and wear the headband for that hour too. You don't want to go to bed with your hair to wet because it could cause bacterial issues with your scalp. \n\nI hope you find something you like, because that's the only person who has to like your hair, YOU! <3\n\nEdit: typo",

In your case, if you want to keep that hairstyle, I recommend a Sea Salt water spray (don\u2019t use actual sea salt). You can find a lot of different brands, but I use Pete&Pedro from AlphaM in YT. This will give volume to your hair and some waves that will make the style look better. \n\nIf you want to change the style, with this hair length, you could get a side part or an undercut. This will make you look more mature, but since it will be longer than normal, it will still look a young\u2019s person hairstyle. Just make sure you go to a hairstylist that specializes in men instead of a barber. A hairstylist will know how to work the hair on top of your head better than a barber (which are better at cutting hair on the sides of your head).",
