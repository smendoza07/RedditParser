Imagine she appears on an episode but the episode is boring or not entertaining enough. Then it would completely shatter the mood, so I get why she wouldn't want to be a guest.\n\nI wonder what the episode would even be like if she becomes a guest. Like would they try to bring back her love line with KJK. Would they even be able to tease them like they do when she is not there. I can't imagine.",

My guess is that EunHye joining will most likely cause a huge amount of news articles to make them the perfect couple. Any potential female love interests can be pushed out because of that. I don't know if EunHye is even looking for marriage since she looked incredibly comfortable living with her best friends.",

However, watching this, I realize I was so wrong. She sounds easy-going and relaxed about this. I'm glad I watched this.

                    "body": "Yoon Eun-hye was a huge drama star about ten or fifteen years ago. She actually co-starred with Song Ji-hyo in **Goong/Princess Hours** and was in a very famous 2007 drama called **Coffee Prince** with Gong Yoo, a popular actor from **Train to Busan**.  From 2004-2005 she starred frequently on the variety show **X-Man** which is where the clips of her with Yoo Jae-seok and Kim Jong-kook come from. In my opinion, it\u2019s fairly possible that she and KJK may have actually dated. However she struggled with depression and alcoholism, which derailed her career, and possibly her personal life, at the time. According to [this 2020 interview](https://www.soompi.com/article/1390452wpp/yoon-eun-hye-talks-about-why-she-doesnt-drink-or-date-reveals-difficulties-due-to-nickname-from-x-man) she said:\n\n>\u201dI cry every day. I don\u2019t cry because I\u2019m sad. For example, **if I hear about an old rumor about me, I get upset** thinking about how that rumor spread when I was just trying to be perfect. I feel so sad about that and cry while self-reflecting on why I lived that way.\u201d\n\nWe all know that Kim Jong-kook is very protective of women. So personally I think he tries to shut down talk of Yoon Eun-hye not out of personal embarrassment, but out of a chivalrous desire to protect her from feeling sad hearing rumors about her past being constantly recirculated. I think Yoo Jae-seok should also be more considerate in his behavior and stop talking about her. He\u2019s a creative comedian, there are plenty of ways he can tease Kim Jong-kook without potentially damaging an innocent woman\u2019s mental health.",

I haven't watched SS, but I've seen clips from the show of her breaking down crying and saying she isn't in the best mental state. I'm always proud to see people being honest like this, because it helps all of us ordinary folks dealing with the same feelings know we're not alone and if a celebrity goes through this, then nobody's immune. It's also amazing to see them come out of it stronger, and healthy, and keep moving forward. So kudos to both of these women. \n\nLike I said, I'm not at all familiar with the world of k-dramas. I only knew JSM, and that was because I happened to watch Show Window after watching Reflections of You. I got around to watching RM because of her, so knew none of the others. I realize they're all quite famous and well known, but again, I'm just out of the loop. (This is in response to the first part of your post, of the shows and movies you mentioned I only know Train to Busan. So, you're basically talking to the US version of SJH, cavewoman.) \n\nI wouldn't know anything about their dating history. However, the second she comes out and says that she isn't comfortable with being the punchline of a joke (she shouldn't and doesn't have to do this publicly either, a phone call or message to YJS would do it) then any mention of her should stop. I only thought this video showed that she wasn't offended or in any way irked to be brought up. I understand that I am basing all of this on very limited knowledge and going off of one video. So take all of this with a grain of salt, it's just an opinion. \n\nI also remembered Coffee Prince because JSM once mentioned SJH looked like someone from that show, which almost got her a sound scolding, so now I guess it was her she was compared to?

Videos like the one posted here actually make me feel even worse for her, because I think she basically is forced to pretend like she\u2019s fine with any joke Yoo Jae-seok wants to make in order to make it seem like she\u2019s a good sport and protect her career. YJS is so powerful in the entertainment world that he\u2019s essentially above criticism. Even the recently elected president of SK got into a scandal by forcing his way onto one of YJS\u2019s shows, causing a bunch of staff to quit under protest and a pretty mixed reaction from YJS but even so, the president wouldn\u2019t dare say anything critical about YJS. He needs to be classy and just leave her alone.",

            "body": "Yoon Eun-hye was a huge drama star about ten or fifteen years ago. She actually co-starred with Song Ji-hyo in **Goong/Princess Hours** and was in a very famous 2007 drama called **Coffee Prince** with Gong Yoo, a popular actor from **Train to Busan**.  From 2004-2005 she starred frequently on the variety show **X-Man** which is where the clips of her with Yoo Jae-seok and Kim Jong-kook come from. In my opinion, it\u2019s fairly possible that she and KJK may have actually dated. However she struggled with depression and alcoholism, which derailed her career, and possibly her personal life, at the time. According to [this 2020 interview](https://www.soompi.com/article/1390452wpp/yoon-eun-hye-talks-about-why-she-doesnt-drink-or-date-reveals-difficulties-due-to-nickname-from-x-man) she said:\n\n>\u201dI cry every day. I don\u2019t cry because I\u2019m sad. For example, **if I hear about an old rumor about me, I get upset** thinking about how that rumor spread when I was just trying to be perfect. I feel so sad about that and cry while self-reflecting on why I lived that way.\u201d\n\nWe all know that Kim Jong-kook is very protective of women. So personally I think he tries to shut down talk of Yoon Eun-hye not out of personal embarrassment, but out of a chivalrous desire to protect her from feeling sad hearing rumors about her past being constantly recirculated. I think Yoo Jae-seok should also be more considerate in his behavior and stop talking about her. He\u2019s a creative comedian, there are plenty of ways he can tease Kim Jong-kook without potentially damaging an innocent woman\u2019s mental health.",

I'm always proud to see people being honest like this, because it helps all of us ordinary folks dealing with the same feelings know we're not alone and if a celebrity goes through this, then nobody's immune.

Videos like the one posted here actually make me feel even worse for her, because I think she basically is forced to pretend like she\u2019s fine with any joke Yoo Jae-seok wants to make in order to make it seem like she\u2019s a good sport and protect her career. YJS is so powerful in the entertainment world that he\u2019s essentially above criticism. Even the recently elected president of SK got into a scandal by forcing his way onto one of YJS\u2019s shows, causing a bunch of staff to quit under protest and a pretty mixed reaction from YJS but even so, the president wouldn\u2019t dare say anything critical about YJS. He needs to be classy and just leave her alone.",
