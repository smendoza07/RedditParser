I can't win against this incredible power, how did he get behind me, he's the strongest person I've ever seen.\n\nThe crew: explains the villain's entire strategy and even though he's killed a million people and defeated a 100 elite level ninja, he doesn't have what Naruto has! \n\nNaruto: yeah you better believe it! Self made baby, you ain't him, I have a sadder back story!!!\n\nFlashback to the swing scene... Flashback to him staring as Sasuke beats his ass and walks away... Flashback to jariya teaching him raesengon \n\nBad guy: you weren't there when the {supposed good guys} nuked and murdered my entire village and family in cold blood! How dare you even say we are the same!!\n\nAt this point he has lost all composure for some reason because of a 12 year old. \n\nNaruto: we are the same! Can't you see! I'm gonna be Hokage!! Hits him with a punch or raesengon (these are interchangeable at this point, they both do the same amount of damage somehow)\n\nThe crew: when did we get so far behind Naruto, he's grown so much lately, we don't understand the hurt he went through\n\nThe crew: points at the bad guy, that's his ninja way! We believe in his dream! \n\nCut to teacher/Hokage/friends in village: Naruto will accomplish his goals! Nothing can stop him!\n\nOutro.",

I objectively know One Piece is a fantastic story and it\u2019s tightly written with call backs to stories I thought were forgotten or dropped but holy moly can I not watch the anime. The anime has an absurd level of cuts (just like Naruto) I used to love watching one piece just like Naruto back in the day but Jesus do both of them use flashbacks too often. I think the only reason I watched shippuden is because I got back into the manga years after the original Naruto anime ended.\n\nI tried to get into the one piece manga and really liked it until the midway point (so far) were the panels felt cluttered to me. I had a hard time figuring out who was talking or what was happening because the panels were just too full of stuff going on. I know that\u2019s a personal preference as I like chainsaw man and paneling like that far more than current one piece",

There were some hype moments but sooooo many fights are just ass pull wins. \n\nTo praise JoJo a bit, I do like how the series lets current season protagonists shine more than previous season protagonists (if they show up). That\u2019s a complaint I\u2019ve had with DBZ since I was a kid. Let Goku stay dead and obviously promote Gohan as the new savior. He\u2019s always had the most potential.",

I objectively know One Piece is a fantastic story and it\u2019s tightly written with call backs to stories I thought were forgotten or dropped but holy moly can I not watch the anime. The anime has an absurd level of cuts (just like Naruto) I used to love watching one piece just like Naruto back in the day but Jesus do both of them use flashbacks too often. I think the only reason I watched shippuden is because I got back into the manga years after the original Naruto anime ended.\n\nI tried to get into the one piece manga and really liked it until the midway point (so far) were the panels felt cluttered to me. I had a hard time figuring out who was talking or what was happening because the panels were just too full of stuff going on. I know that\u2019s a personal preference as I like chainsaw man and paneling like that far more than current one piece",

I can't win against this incredible power, how did he get behind me, he's the strongest person I've ever seen.\n\nThe crew: explains the villain's entire strategy and even though he's killed a million people and defeated a 100 elite level ninja, he doesn't have what Naruto has! \n\nNaruto: yeah you better believe it! Self made baby, you ain't him, I have a sadder back story!!!\n\nFlashback to the swing scene... Flashback to him staring as Sasuke beats his ass and walks away... Flashback to jariya teaching him raesengon \n\nBad guy: you weren't there when the {supposed good guys} nuked and murdered my entire village and family in cold blood! How dare you even say we are the same!!\n\nAt this point he has lost all composure for some reason because of a 12 year old. \n\nNaruto: we are the same! Can't you see! I'm gonna be Hokage!! Hits him with a punch or raesengon (these are interchangeable at this point, they both do the same amount of damage somehow)\n\nThe crew: when did we get so far behind Naruto, he's grown so much lately, we don't understand the hurt he went through\n\nThe crew: points at the bad guy, that's his ninja way! We believe in his dream! \n\nCut to teacher/Hokage/friends in village: Naruto will accomplish his goals! Nothing can stop him!\n\nOutro.",
