Even when you let a beard grow, you have to trim and shape it.\n\nYou definitely look better in the second photo but that was (presumably) taken on the day of the cut. Give it a couple of weeks (if you don't tend to it) and you'll look just as scruffy.\n\n\nThis, in my opinion, isn't one style vs the other, it's \"freshly styled (in a suit)\" vs \"untouched for weeks (in PJs).\"",

            "body": "Massive improvement.\n\nIf I can give any pointers or tips for changes, I'd try trimming the cheeks of your beard slightly shorter, so it's not widening your face so much. Beard cut is like a hair cut, if it's the same length all round, it'll look bad (think like a grown out buzzcut).\n\nYou're wearing very loose fitting clothes which don't help your all-round \"sleekness\". Don't hide your figure so much, I'm sure you'd look baller in some more formfitting shirts, pants, and jackets. If you're worried about price then I have a friend who buys suits on the cheaper side but then gets it tailored. No expensive factory tailored suit will beat an actual tailored suit. The money you save off the suit will pay for the tailor more than one time over.\n\nI like the hair a lot but you could also try a shorter version that is a little more swept back like Matthew McConaughey or Patrick Dempsey. You can also go for a more forward swept like the lead guy from the TV show Hannibal. All three are curly-haired men who rock their curls in different ways.",
