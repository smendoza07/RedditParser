But I will say I think you're way too hard on yourself bc the photos you posted look really good.\n\nI definitely understand about the maintenance aspect -- I'm blessed with thick hair, but it's so unruly and takes a lot of upkeep to look good if it's anything beyond a military-type cut.\n\nBut I think giving yourself some length on top will look great on you.  Have you tried products beyond leave in conditioner?",
