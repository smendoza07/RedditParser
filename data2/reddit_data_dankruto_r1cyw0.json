Then he seems surprised when Sasuke has fucking trust issues. Konan isn\u2019t really a villain at all just misguided and frankly I would say Kisame is no more a villain than any ninja. He kills people for money, the fact he happens to enjoy the fighting and doesn\u2019t mind the killing is really the only thing that makes him villain like at all. Other than that he\u2019s quite loyal to his comrades and does his best to fulfill his obligation to them.",

He could have at least left the fucking children that posed absolutely no threat to anyone alive.

This dude was like rock lee levels of loser at first. Not to mention a child of war. He had no family we know of and the only people that were constantly in his life were kakashi, rin and minato. But really the only one who is always supportive of him was rin. But as soon as his relationship with Kakashi starts looking up he gets it taken away by the boulder. Now imagine being alone in a cave for months with the only thing that's keeping you going being your best friend and your crush. And all the while an old man is telling you to give up on your life that has been crap up until now because he can literally give you your ideal life if you follow him. Then everything hes was looking forward to is just ruined. It wasnt entirely rins death that did it. It was a slow buildup in his life with only one good experience giving him hope and it was taken away. Ofc hes gonna go to madara. And its not like he didnt have inner turmoil. He probably had a lot of it but like shown in the war he just pushes it back because hes gonna make a better world so why bother himself with this ones issues. Its actually one of the saddest stories for me. He was a child and had everything he loved taken away and unlike kakashi, naruto, or even really sasuke he had no positive support group. Only the promise of a better life from madara",

I wish his change to the dark side was as gradual as it was during his development to seeing rin and that the manga actually showed how he might have been disgusted about what he was becoming for a short time, only THEN to be reassured by madara that his path was \u201crighteous\u201d\n\n>! Don\u2019t get me wrong, the masked man is the coolest villain ever, but it just feels so outlandish a kid turns so cold so quickly, especially since he\u2019s a KID. !< \n\nEven if madara was evil, he had complex ideologies and had multiple experiences and influence to drive him to what he became. !>Obito saw his love interest die and just turned to the dark side. I get the whole bezerk thing once he got the MS, but he was also in a time period where war and death were normal. !<",

As the previous comment said, he was hated his whole life and only had a few close people. He then was forced away from them all, and Subject to Madara brainwashing him to try and believe he was making a better world. Given his life I would understand if he agreed right then, but because he was a 'good guy' at that point in time he consistently refused. Madara's entire point was this world only brings suffering, obito holding on to the few people he cared for refused to believe this. Then he immediately sees one of them die, at the hands on another, while the last (minato) who has the capability to stop them fails to come.  \n\nSuddenly madaras points about this world being horrible ring true. Yes that moment cracked him, but it was only due to the build up of everything beforehand. Obito was as idealistic as they come in the show, he was naruto before naruto. To see him break was rough but understandable\n\nAlso, Haku/kimimaro never had any hesitance when killing for zabuza/orochimaru, and in those cases it wasnt even mind set of 'for the greater good' it was just I owe this person my life now I will do whatever they say. Yet they get no shit for this when obito does despite he himself actually believing that he will make a better world for everyone.",

It was just due to the fact that he was revealed later in the story during the war. We can infer how he felt by the his actions during the war arc and how all that previous trauma had added up. We literally do the exact same thing with madara. The only seriously bad experiences actually shown for madara are his brother izuna dying and maybe the showing of war. The rest is off screen stuff just like obito.\nAnd the fact that he is a kid only makes it more believable. Kids are impressionable. And after an experience like being crushed alive and taken away from all friends and loved ones for an extended period of time, yeah, hes gonna listen to the one dude telling him to give up on life. That brainwashing is only enhanced by rin dying. Hes just an impressionable kid that would do anything to get back to how things were before being crushed. Madara would have given that to him. I think thats pretty reasonable for a kid.\nAnd just cause war and death were frequent doesnt mean that it doesnt traumatize people. By saying that you literally undermine madaras motives as well.",

Just adding that nagutos rinne was really madaras and how he has full mastery of it when we were never given any hints to him even having and unlocking them. He teased obito since volume 28 and Obito feels in line with power since you can go back and find the hint.",

He sees the underlying social distrust the village has of the Uchiha. Which can be seen when he tells Hashirama that he knows Tobirama will be the second Hokage, and how the villagers, despite Madara being just as integral to the founding of the village, are scared of him. And then, just as he said would happen, Tobirama becomes Hokage and goes and segregates the village. Putting place a secret state-sanctioned monitoring system to watch the Uchiha.  And as the years pass, and as villages modernized and grew into more formal states, the darker underbellies of govt started to emerge as we see in the Foundation where all types of evil shit happens. And none of this actually stops wars as was the point in Villages in the first place. Villages still distrust each other and go to war with each other. Only this time it isn't small clans, but larger, formal militaries with different powerful clans working together to kill each other.. Madara may have not know exactly how it would play out, but he really was right about the Villages not being enough. \n\n>swearing to protect the Leaf\n\n\nYes initially, but then as I just laid out, he realized Villages weren't going to be enough. His main objective was to attain peace. \n\n>being power hungry\n\n\nYes, I agree. No where did I say he wasn't power hungry. But being power hungry in itself is not a bad thing. Power is a morally neutral thing. The pursuit of power is also morally neutral. The ideology, the goal, or what someone or something wants to DO with power is what can be judged in moralistic terms. \n\n>he's delusional\n\n\nNo, actually it's quite rational. You CANNOT look at the Shinobi world- which is BY DEFINITION ruled by deceit, killing, betrayal, and quite honestly eugenics, and tell me that the idea that maybe shinobi don't actually know what  is in their best interest is wrong. Any peace treaty is only momentary and can be broken at literally any moment. A world that makes the Foundation a rational institution is fundamentally morally bad. Look at what was done (by state-sanctioned action mind you) to Itachi, the Uchiha, Kisame, Zabuza, Rin, Bee (and all of the Jinchuriki)- and tell me That world is a rational world where the shinobi that fight and defend the existence of such a world have an understanding of peace. \n\nUndermining the village, trying to kill Hashirama to take his power, sacrificing the Jinchuriki to fulfill his plan, throwing the world into destruction before it can become peaceful- I don't deny any of that. But that isn't my point. My point is that his larger goal, whether you think it makes sense or not, is quite rational and justified when you look at the context of his existence. You may think that individual free will trumps the betterment of the world at large, or that his pursuit of power led to morally bad things, and I'm not even trying to debate that with you, but you CANNOT simply look at Madara and say, \"he's a dumb despot that just wants power\".",

I did not mean when Hashirama first proposes the Village system, or even when their village starts to take off, I mean when the village starts to take form, it was still in it's feudal stages, and then after he reads the Uchiha tablet.\n\n And before you oversimplify the tablet reading, keep in mind this is a universe where there are ancient all-powerful magic beasts, ancient super-moves are written on ancient scrolls, the Sage of the 6thfold Path is literally incarnated, Princess Kaguya is a demon monster, and the Shinto Pantheon are materialized in super techniques. So in that context, believing an ancient tablet makes a lot of fucking sense.\n\n\\>Blaming Madara for the failure of the Village system because he fucked around too much\n\nAgain, Im not saying Madara didn't do bad things, including sowing distrust amongst the villages, but if you think that HE'S the reason it didn't work, then idk if you're just incapable of larger critiques of structures in general, if you just refuse to, or if you are just are naive. The entire universe is based on the Sengoku Jidai, and Shinobi clans in service to feudal lords. In-universe, the legitimacy of the bigger villages is entirely based on having support from a feudal lord and protecting said feudal lord. Aside from the conflicts between rival villages rooted in rivalries between clans, there is also underlying conflicts in the Feudal Lords ever sought war between nations. Such a world would be in constant chaos without Madara or the Akatsuki. Just like the Sengoku period. So did Madara do a lot to sow divisions? Maybe. But you are naive if you think that would have made a larger difference. Hell, even at the first Kage summit, they were all in distrust and threatened the Sand Village with war for making a reasonable demand. No attempt to compromise, just \"we'll gang up on you\" until Hashirama had to cry to get them to at least talk to each other. \n\nYou say that Madara had a hand in creating that world, but he didn't. The machinations of such a world were already in existence way before Madara or Hashirama made the first Village. Madara may have taken some extreme steps, but war between Villages over Village politics or because of Feudal Lord demands are inevitable because of the very nature of the universe.\n\n\\>Disturst between the Uchiha and the larger village\n\nReally? Do you really think that the Uchiha would not have been persecuted had it not been for Madara? The ruling clan of the Village were the rival clan of the Uchiha, and they only formed a peace treaty because they had a Great Man of History in Hashirama. Tobirama disliked the Uchiha as a clan, talking in slurs at them, even after his death when he saw Sasuke. Sure he had \"one of the good ones\" in his one Uchiha friend, but that doesn't negate his larger distrust of the Uchiha. And when even an evil but analytical motherfucker like Orochimaru can say, \"your policies caused the uprising\", you know there's something to it. \n\nAlso, I understand that members of the Uchiha also distrusted Madara, but so what? People of any group aren't a monolith. Even if a majority of people from a certain group believe something that doesn't mean they speak for that group, or that they even represent that group. \n\n\\>the Uchiha \"Curse of Hatred\"\n\nReally? If you're going to cite this as justification for their segregation and constant surveillance, then I'm not gonna bother with this debate after this. Even Tobirama, the Bull Connor of the Leaf Village, said they had this wrong. The Uchiha are most inclined to love. Literally what Hashirama and the racist- I mean Tobirama said. And just because Obito said it was right...so what?\n\n\\>Philosophy 301\n\nYou used the term \"moral relativism\", and assuming you really do have an understanding of that term, then I'm going to assume you have some real familiarity with philosophy. And if you do, then you know that in order for something to actually be a Universal, then it, by definition, must be provable in all cases. All. Every. It doesn't have to be disproven in 10, 100, 1,000 etc cases, only ONE. This is Philosophy 300 level stuff. So I'm simply going to say, \"Alfonso the Wise\" of Castille. There are others, but he's the least controversial, safest bet, and the one I'm most familiar with since I wrote my graduating paper on him and his political goals for my BA in History. \n\n\\>What betterment of the world?\n\nDo you really not think people living in a dream world where, as far they know, they get everything they want, never have to worry about conflict (unless they want it, in which case it only happens in their mind and nobody actually dies), and the real world is left to nature is not an objectively good thing?

I did not mean when Hashirama first proposes the Village system, or even when their village starts to take off, I mean when the village starts to take form, it was still in it's feudal stages, and then after he reads the Uchiha tablet.\n\n\nThis only happens because he believes he's unlikely to be chosen over Tobirama and after he fails with his separatist plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>And before you oversimplify the tablet reading, keep in mind this is a universe where there are ancient all-powerful magic beasts, ancient super-moves are written on ancient scrolls, the Sage of the 6thfold Path is literally incarnated, Princess Kaguya is a demon monster, and the Shinto Pantheon are materialized in super techniques. So in that context, believing an ancient tablet makes a lot of fucking sense.\n\n\nMost of those things are myths by the time Madara got to read them, this mythological gods have come and gone a millennia ago.\nIn fact most ninja do not believe them, hell they don't believe the extent of Hashirama's power who lived and died a century ago.\n\n\nThat's the thing, putting your trust in a old stone that may or may not be written by an ancient God with unknown purposes and deciding to put your faith in it without any type of rational thinking.\n\nThat's why he obviously gets backstabbed himself.\n\n\n\n\n\n>Again, Im not saying Madara didn't do bad things, including sowing distrust amongst the villages, but if you think that HE'S the reason it didn't work, then idk if you're just incapable of larger critiques of structures in general, if you just refuse to, or if you are just are naive. The entire universe is based on the Sengoku Jidai, and Shinobi clans in service to feudal lords. In-universe, the legitimacy of the bigger villages is entirely based on having support from a feudal lord and protecting said feudal lord. Aside from the conflicts between rival villages rooted in rivalries between clans, there is also underlying conflicts in the Feudal Lords ever sought war between nations. Such a world would be in constant chaos without Madara or the Akatsuki. Just like the Sengoku period. So did Madara do a lot to sow divisions? Maybe. But you are naive if you think that would have made a larger difference. Hell, even at the first Kage summit, they were all in distrust and threatened the Sand Village with war for making a reasonable demand. No attempt to compromise, just \"we'll gang up on you\" until Hashirama had to cry to get them to at least talk to each other. \n\n\nSee?? That's your problem, you assume what I don't say.\nI didn't say that the village system didn't have massive problems from the get go or that it would fail eventually.\nI'm arguing that Madara never gave the system a chance once he became convinced he wouldn't be the one on top. I'm telling you that Madara did absolutely everything in his hand to sow distrust and resentment.\nThat Madara became such a threat for **everyone** that even a century after his death, the mere thought that he was behind the Akatsuki sent every big nation in a frenzy and moved them to war.\nIt is a fact that Madara try to fullfil his own prophecy. So it's obvious that he shouldn't get bragging rights when it becomes true.\n\nYou're right that in the first Kage summit, things were starting to get heated. But Hashirama pleaded with them and they relented, they actually did try to give peace a chance. The one who backstabbed that peace was Madara, he was the one who went around bullying other nations. And wether you want to admit it or not, we know that his encounter with Onoki shattered the latter and changed his worldview entirely... This man would rule Iwakagure for sixty plus years.\n\nHow can his blabbering of peace fit with his warmongering and imperialistic attitudes?? It can't.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>You say that Madara had a hand in creating that world, but he didn't. The machinations of such a world were already in existence way before Madara or Hashirama made the first Village. Madara may have taken some extreme steps, but war between Villages over Village politics or because of Feudal Lord demands are inevitable because of the very nature of the universe.\n\nOh he very much did, this is a fact. It's likely that Peace wouldn't have lasted forever?? Sure, no peace is eternal.\nIt's a fact that there was peace and Madara went screwing things up as per usual. \nMadara and Hashirama changed and shaped the world when they created the village system. \nWe have people struggling to achieve peace and then we have Madara the imperialist warmonger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Really? Do you really think that the Uchiha would not have been persecuted had it not been for Madara?\n\nYes. The very reason Tobirama was wary of them was because he knew another Madara could rise among them.\nThe very reason why decades later the higher ups move against them is because they are convinced that an Uchiha had attacked the Leaf with Kurama, in trust **Madara's disciple had done so, knowing he would frame his clan**. The only reason they have this suspicion is because Madara did in the past. \n\n\n\n>The ruling clan of the Village were the rival clan of the Uchiha, and they only formed a peace treaty because they had a Great Man of History in Hashirama\n\nThat's the thing... **They were not the ruling clan**.\nOne of their own became Hokage, that's very different from the whole clan ruling.\n\nTobirama was also in favour for peace, even since he was child. He went on record insulting the adults, both Uchiha and Senju, and arguing that if they really wanted peace, they should forget the bad blood, sign accords and stick to them.\n\n\n\n>Tobirama disliked the Uchiha as a clan, talking in slurs at them, even after his death when he saw Sasuke. \n\nNo such thing happened.\nHe said that he wasn't surprised that an Uchiha associated himself with scoundrel like Orochimaru.\n\n\n\n\n\n>Sure he had \"one of the good ones\" in his one Uchiha friend, but that doesn't negate his larger distrust of the Uchiha.\n\nHe never denies that one. \nHe also explains why he was wary of them. It's obvious that any clan cursed with being genetically predisposed to go mad and the crazier the got the more op they became was a motive for worrying.\nSeems funny that you were talking big about realpolitik a paragraph ago but went full Hashirama here.\n\n\n\n\n>And when even an evil but analytical motherfucker like Orochimaru can say, \"your policies caused the uprising\", you know there's something to it. \n\nNothing Orochimaru said made any sense. \nThis is highlighted with the fact that the Uchiha actually loved their position as Military Police.\nOrochi also act like people naturally distrust officers and it isn't their actions what turn people on them.\nPeople also forget that Orochi also said that  the Uchiha became super arrogant due their power and position... \n\nWe can discuss this in full but no, his policies had nothing to do with it. \n\n\n\n>Also, I understand that members of the Uchiha also distrusted Madara, but so what? People of any group aren't a monolith. Even if a majority of people from a certain group believe something that doesn't mean they speak for that group, or that they even represent that group. \n\n\n- If the majority of a group doesn't represent that group... Who does?\n\n- Madara said that not a single member of his clan supported him in his uprising and they all turned their backs on him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Even Tobirama, the Bull Connor of the Leaf Village, said they had this wrong. The Uchiha are most inclined to love\n\nHe never said that this was wrong lol.\nHe said that it's wrong the saying that *the Senju love more intensely than the Uchiha*.\n\nHe said that the Uchiha love more but that once they lose the thing they love they start losing it little by little and the physical manifestation of that is the Sharingan.\nThe more the lose it, the more strong they get.\n\n\n\n\n\n>Literally what Hashirama and the racist- I mean Tobirama said. And just because Obito said it was right...so what?\n\nWow, we have abandoned any perception of neutrality. We just went full racist Tobirama meme.\n\nYou don't have to believe it just because Obito supports it, it's simply a curiosity, there's enough evidence for it enough. Starting for the fact that both Black Zetsu and Indra forced the wrong path onto the Uchiha.\nThis is the same clan that used to kill each other for their eyes and all that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>So I'm simply going to say, \"Alfonso the Wise\" of Castille. There are others, but he's the least controversial, safest bet, and the one I'm most familiar with since I wrote my graduating paper on him and his political goals for my BA in History. \n\n\nI did ask you for ten. You only give me one.\nThe one you think it's the most morally good. Which is someone that forced ethnic cleansing on his lands...  If they are controversial then you know already that they are not morally good lol.\nYou either are confusing morally with great ruler or you simply felt the need to answer.\n\n\n\nI ask you again, what morally good choice did Madara ever do in his quest for power?\n\n\n\n>Do you really not think people living in a dream world where, as far they know, they get everything they want, never have to worry about conflict (unless they want it, in which case it only happens in their mind and nobody actually dies), and the real world is left to nature is not an objectively good thing? By all manners that we quantify \"goodness\", that hits the mark.\n\nLol no, I think that a world of sleeping slaves that are forced to be drugged forever without having any experience whatsoever except that of their dreams.\nNo, dreaming forever is not good. It's hell for me.\nIf you believe that living your life in a comatose sleep is the ultimate goal, by all means do that. Just don't **force it** on the rest of us. That's something Madara ever understood either, diplomacy and free will.",

They really dont realize that Madara aint shit without B O R R O W E D powers like hashirama cells, sage of six ass, edo tensei or kurama. Base Madara gets absolutely fucking obliterated by any Hokage and many other shinobi. And every human being with a fully functional non-neanderthal brain knows it.\n\nTo better understand how retarded these fanboys are, i literally saw an instagram post yesterday where some people said Madara stomps adult Naruto and Sasuke low diff. Or get this, there's people who actually think he is stronger than Kaguya. MARK MY WORDS there will come a day when they'll say he can beat the Otsutsuki God. \n\nIt just goes to show how a bunch of braindead entitled manchildren can ruin a character for you. I dont even think i hate Danzo as much as i hate Madara. You thought Itachitards were bad? Naaaah fam Madaratards are a plague in this community. Worse than the My Hero Academia community. And that says a lot.\n\nEDIT: lmao im getting downvoted by the manchildren for speaking facts. Thank you for proving my point about you. You made this so easy. I rest my case.",

There is going to be a lot of insight into the First Shinobi World War, and not just through flashbacks and exposition but possibly through an entire Arc similar to the way Kakashi's backstory was flushed out. Going even further back, there will also be more detail given to the warring states period, because I feel like the dynamics of the different Clans in that era are fuzzy at best.",

He did kill Jiraiya but at least had a solid motive for his actions, as misguided as they may be.\n\nItachi: eh. I really think they could\u2019ve written his relationship with Sasuke better. Torturing the poor kid so he gets stronger was dumb af considering this dude was supposed to be a genius.\n\nKonan, Haku & Zabuza: abso-fucking-lutely \n\nShould be on the list: Kisame. Dude lived by a code and went out like a G. One of the best written villains and didn\u2019t do anything to make you dislike him.\n\nI think people are confusing \u201clikeable villains\u201d with \u201cgood villains\u201d. A likeable villain is relatable, you sympathize with their cause, and they\u2019re often more of an anti-hero. A good villain is one that is evil af, believably justifies their actions (even if they\u2019re extreme), is steadfast in their ideology, and is generally unlikeable (or likeable because they embody these qualities in an endearing way). \n\nOrochimaru, Madara, and Danzo are examples of good villains that aren\u2019t necessarily likeable. They serve a necessary role in the development of the heroes and progress the story, but are largely irredeemable because of the measures they took to achieve their goals. A good series needs both types of villains.",

So even if you argue that 1st tomoe was because Itachi tortured him the rest of its development was because of his positive attachments. Clearly torturing him was not the best way to develop the eyes, Itachi admits as much before he gets released from Edo Tensei.",

Just because his intentions are understandable doesn\u2019t make what Itachi did any less horrible. Killed every single relative of his except one and then mentally tortured the last living one that he \u201cloved\u201d to the point of literal insanity. Then he seems surprised when Sasuke has fucking trust issues. Konan isn\u2019t really a villain at all just misguided and frankly I would say Kisame is no more a villain than any ninja. He kills people for money, the fact he happens to enjoy the fighting and doesn\u2019t mind the killing is really the only thing that makes him villain like at all. Other than that he\u2019s quite loyal to his comrades and does his best to fulfill his obligation to them.",

He was always playing the good soldier for someone else. He was presented with those two options and he chose one. He then had to live with the burden of that choice. He could have instead killed just his father and his diehard supporters and taken leadership of the clan. He could have just killed the ninja in the clan. He could have at least left the fucking children that posed absolutely no threat to anyone alive. Instead he said hmmm I either commit mass murder of my own clan down to the last man woman and child regardless of wether or not they know how to fight or are even capable of fighting or know anything about the coup at all, or I decide to turn against the village my clan lives in. Shitty choices sure but there were certainly other options.",

Just went along with whatever orders he was given. If he'd belonged to Konoha, people would have seen him as a really good guy because they'd (presumably) be telling him to do different stuff. \n\nOr not.

This dude was like rock lee levels of loser at first. Not to mention a child of war. He had no family we know of and the only people that were constantly in his life were kakashi, rin and minato. But really the only one who is always supportive of him was rin. But as soon as his relationship with Kakashi starts looking up he gets it taken away by the boulder. Now imagine being alone in a cave for months with the only thing that's keeping you going being your best friend and your crush. And all the while an old man is telling you to give up on your life that has been crap up until now because he can literally give you your ideal life if you follow him. Then everything hes was looking forward to is just ruined. It wasnt entirely rins death that did it. It was a slow buildup in his life with only one good experience giving him hope and it was taken away. Ofc hes gonna go to madara. And its not like he didnt have inner turmoil. He probably had a lot of it but like shown in the war he just pushes it back because hes gonna make a better world so why bother himself with this ones issues. Its actually one of the saddest stories for me. He was a child and had everything he loved taken away and unlike kakashi, naruto, or even really sasuke he had no positive support group. Only the promise of a better life from madara",

I wish his change to the dark side was as gradual as it was during his development to seeing rin and that the manga actually showed how he might have been disgusted about what he was becoming for a short time, only THEN to be reassured by madara that his path was \u201crighteous\u201d\n\n>! Don\u2019t get me wrong, the masked man is the coolest villain ever, but it just feels so outlandish a kid turns so cold so quickly, especially since he\u2019s a KID. !< \n\nEven if madara was evil, he had complex ideologies and had multiple experiences and influence to drive him to what he became. !>Obito saw his love interest die and just turned to the dark side.

As the previous comment said, he was hated his whole life and only had a few close people. He then was forced away from them all, and Subject to Madara brainwashing him to try and believe he was making a better world. Given his life I would understand if he agreed right then, but because he was a 'good guy' at that point in time he consistently refused. Madara's entire point was this world only brings suffering, obito holding on to the few people he cared for refused to believe this. Then he immediately sees one of them die, at the hands on another, while the last (minato) who has the capability to stop them fails to come.  \n\nSuddenly madaras points about this world being horrible ring true. Yes that moment cracked him, but it was only due to the build up of everything beforehand. Obito was as idealistic as they come in the show, he was naruto before naruto. To see him break was rough but understandable\n\nAlso, Haku/kimimaro never had any hesitance when killing for zabuza/orochimaru, and in those cases it wasnt even mind set of 'for the greater good' it was just I owe this person my life now I will do whatever they say. Yet they get no shit for this when obito does despite he himself actually believing that he will make a better world for everyone.",

We can infer how he felt by the his actions during the war arc and how all that previous trauma had added up. We literally do the exact same thing with madara. The only seriously bad experiences actually shown for madara are his brother izuna dying and maybe the showing of war. The rest is off screen stuff just like obito.\nAnd the fact that he is a kid only makes it more believable. Kids are impressionable. And after an experience like being crushed alive and taken away from all friends and loved ones for an extended period of time, yeah, hes gonna listen to the one dude telling him to give up on life. That brainwashing is only enhanced by rin dying. Hes just an impressionable kid that would do anything to get back to how things were before being crushed. Madara would have given that to him. I think thats pretty reasonable for a kid.\nAnd just cause war and death were frequent doesnt mean that it doesnt traumatize people. By saying that you literally undermine madaras motives as well.",

Just adding that nagutos rinne was really madaras and how he has full mastery of it when we were never given any hints to him even having and unlocking them.

That makes sense to me, but it could\u2019ve been explained better (he just said it was his bloodlust) and it made him look like a massive Mary Sue at the time.

He sees the underlying social distrust the village has of the Uchiha. Which can be seen when he tells Hashirama that he knows Tobirama will be the second Hokage, and how the villagers, despite Madara being just as integral to the founding of the village, are scared of him. And then, just as he said would happen, Tobirama becomes Hokage and goes and segregates the village. Putting place a secret state-sanctioned monitoring system to watch the Uchiha.  And as the years pass, and as villages modernized and grew into more formal states, the darker underbellies of govt started to emerge as we see in the Foundation where all types of evil shit happens. And none of this actually stops wars as was the point in Villages in the first place. Villages still distrust each other and go to war with each other. Only this time it isn't small clans, but larger, formal militaries with different powerful clans working together to kill each other.. Madara may have not know exactly how it would play out, but he really was right about the Villages not being enough. \n\n>swearing to protect the Leaf\n\n\nYes initially, but then as I just laid out, he realized Villages weren't going to be enough. His main objective was to attain peace. \n\n>being power hungry\n\n\nYes, I agree. No where did I say he wasn't power hungry. But being power hungry in itself is not a bad thing. Power is a morally neutral thing. The pursuit of power is also morally neutral. The ideology, the goal, or what someone or something wants to DO with power is what can be judged in moralistic terms. \n\n>he's delusional\n\n\nNo, actually it's quite rational. You CANNOT look at the Shinobi world- which is BY DEFINITION ruled by deceit, killing, betrayal, and quite honestly eugenics, and tell me that the idea that maybe shinobi don't actually know what  is in their best interest is wrong. Any peace treaty is only momentary and can be broken at literally any moment. A world that makes the Foundation a rational institution is fundamentally morally bad. Look at what was done (by state-sanctioned action mind you) to Itachi, the Uchiha, Kisame, Zabuza, Rin, Bee (and all of the Jinchuriki)- and tell me That world is a rational world where the shinobi that fight and defend the existence of such a world have an understanding of peace. \n\nUndermining the village, trying to kill Hashirama to take his power, sacrificing the Jinchuriki to fulfill his plan, throwing the world into destruction before it can become peaceful- I don't deny any of that. But that isn't my point. My point is that his larger goal, whether you think it makes sense or not, is quite rational and justified when you look at the context of his existence. You may think that individual free will trumps the betterment of the world at large, or that his pursuit of power led to morally bad things, and I'm not even trying to debate that with you, but you CANNOT simply look at Madara and say, \"he's a dumb despot that just wants power\".",

It means that you trample everything and anyone in your pursue for **dominance**. Sounds like our man. \nBeing power hungry has never being morally neutral.

There are several reasons why it's delusional but the more obvious of them all is that his peace ended up being the ultimate con.\nSo, only for that it's pure delusion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>You CANNOT look at the Shinobi world- which is BY DEFINITION ruled by deceit, killing, betrayal, and quite honestly eugenics, and tell me that the idea that maybe shinobi don't actually know what is in their best interest is wrong.\n\nNo, but a I can look at *MADARA* who is **BY  DEFINITION**, murderous, deceitful, traitorous and quite honestly fond of eugenics, \"weak people disgust me\" and all that, and tell you that this fucker doesn't know what's best for himself let alone for the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n>A world that makes the Foundation a rational institution is fundamentally morally bad.

So in that context, believing an ancient tablet makes a lot of fucking sense.\n\n\\>Blaming Madara for the failure of the Village system because he fucked around too much\n\nAgain, Im not saying Madara didn't do bad things, including sowing distrust amongst the villages, but if you think that HE'S the reason it didn't work, then idk if you're just incapable of larger critiques of structures in general, if you just refuse to, or if you are just are naive. The entire universe is based on the Sengoku Jidai, and Shinobi clans in service to feudal lords. In-universe, the legitimacy of the bigger villages is entirely based on having support from a feudal lord and protecting said feudal lord. Aside from the conflicts between rival villages rooted in rivalries between clans, there is also underlying conflicts in the Feudal Lords ever sought war between nations. Such a world would be in constant chaos without Madara or the Akatsuki. Just like the Sengoku period. So did Madara do a lot to sow divisions? Maybe. But you are naive if you think that would have made a larger difference. Hell, even at the first Kage summit, they were all in distrust and threatened the Sand Village with war for making a reasonable demand. No attempt to compromise, just \"we'll gang up on you\" until Hashirama had to cry to get them to at least talk to each other. \n\nYou say that Madara had a hand in creating that world, but he didn't. The machinations of such a world were already in existence way before Madara or Hashirama made the first Village. Madara may have taken some extreme steps, but war between Villages over Village politics or because of Feudal Lord demands are inevitable because of the very nature of the universe.\n\n\\>Disturst between the Uchiha and the larger village\n\nReally? Do you really think that the Uchiha would not have been persecuted had it not been for Madara? The ruling clan of the Village were the rival clan of the Uchiha, and they only formed a peace treaty because they had a Great Man of History in Hashirama. Tobirama disliked the Uchiha as a clan, talking in slurs at them, even after his death when he saw Sasuke. Sure he had \"one of the good ones\" in his one Uchiha friend, but that doesn't negate his larger distrust of the Uchiha. And when even an evil but analytical motherfucker like Orochimaru can say, \"your policies caused the uprising\", you know there's something to it. \n\nAlso, I understand that members of the Uchiha also distrusted Madara, but so what? People of any group aren't a monolith. Even if a majority of people from a certain group believe something that doesn't mean they speak for that group, or that they even represent that group. \n\n\\>the Uchiha \"Curse of Hatred\"\n\nReally? If you're going to cite this as justification for their segregation and constant surveillance, then I'm not gonna bother with this debate after this. Even Tobirama, the Bull Connor of the Leaf Village, said they had this wrong. The Uchiha are most inclined to love. Literally what Hashirama and the racist- I mean Tobirama said. And just because Obito said it was right...so what?\n\n\\>Philosophy 301\n\nYou used the term \"moral relativism\", and assuming you really do have an understanding of that term, then I'm going to assume you have some real familiarity with philosophy. And if you do, then you know that in order for something to actually be a Universal, then it, by definition, must be provable in all cases. All. Every. It doesn't have to be disproven in 10, 100, 1,000 etc cases, only ONE. This is Philosophy 300 level stuff. So I'm simply going to say, \"Alfonso the Wise\" of Castille. There are others, but he's the least controversial, safest bet, and the one I'm most familiar with since I wrote my graduating paper on him and his political goals for my BA in History. \n\n\\>What betterment of the world?\n\nDo you really not think people living in a dream world where, as far they know, they get everything they want, never have to worry about conflict (unless they want it, in which case it only happens in their mind and nobody actually dies), and the real world is left to nature is not an objectively good thing?

I'm telling you that Madara did absolutely everything in his hand to sow distrust and resentment.\nThat Madara became such a threat for **everyone** that even a century after his death, the mere thought that he was behind the Akatsuki sent every big nation in a frenzy and moved them to war.\nIt is a fact that Madara try to fullfil his own prophecy. So it's obvious that he shouldn't get bragging rights when it becomes true.\n\nYou're right that in the first Kage summit, things were starting to get heated. But Hashirama pleaded with them and they relented, they actually did try to give peace a chance. The one who backstabbed that peace was Madara, he was the one who went around bullying other nations. And wether you want to admit it or not, we know that his encounter with Onoki shattered the latter and changed his worldview entirely...

Madara may have taken some extreme steps, but war between Villages over Village politics or because of Feudal Lord demands are inevitable because of the very nature of the universe.\n\nOh he very much did, this is a fact. It's likely that Peace wouldn't have lasted forever?? Sure, no peace is eternal.\nIt's a fact that there was peace and Madara went screwing things up as per usual. \nMadara and Hashirama changed and shaped the world when they created the village system. \nWe have people struggling to achieve peace and then we have Madara the imperialist warmonger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Really? Do you really think that the Uchiha would not have been persecuted had it not been for Madara?\n\nYes. The very reason Tobirama was wary of them was because he knew another Madara could rise among them.\nThe very reason why decades later the higher ups move against them is because they are convinced that an Uchiha had attacked the Leaf with Kurama, in trust **Madara's disciple had done so, knowing he would frame his clan**. The only reason they have this suspicion is because Madara did in the past. \n\n\n\n>The ruling clan of the Village were the rival clan of the Uchiha, and they only formed a peace treaty because they had a Great Man of History in Hashirama\n\nThat's the thing... **They were not the ruling clan**.\nOne of their own became Hokage, that's very different from the whole clan ruling.\n\nTobirama was also in favour for peace, even since he was child. He went on record insulting the adults, both Uchiha and Senju, and arguing that if they really wanted peace, they should forget the bad blood, sign accords and stick to them.\n\n\n\n>Tobirama disliked the Uchiha as a clan, talking in slurs at them, even after his death when he saw Sasuke. \n\nNo such thing happened.\nHe said that he wasn't surprised that an Uchiha associated himself with scoundrel like Orochimaru.\n\n\n\n\n\n>Sure he had \"one of the good ones\" in his one Uchiha friend, but that doesn't negate his larger distrust of the Uchiha.\n\nHe never denies that one. \nHe also explains why he was wary of them. It's obvious that any clan cursed with being genetically predisposed to go mad and the crazier the got the more op they became was a motive for worrying.\nSeems funny that you were talking big about realpolitik a paragraph ago but went full Hashirama here.\n\n\n\n\n>And when even an evil but analytical motherfucker like Orochimaru can say, \"your policies caused the uprising\", you know there's something to it. \n\nNothing Orochimaru said made any sense. \nThis is highlighted with the fact that the Uchiha actually loved their position as Military Police.\nOrochi also act like people naturally distrust officers and it isn't their actions what turn people on them.\nPeople also forget that Orochi also said that  the Uchiha became super arrogant due their power and position... \n\nWe can discuss this in full but no, his policies had nothing to do with it. \n\n\n\n>Also, I understand that members of the Uchiha also distrusted Madara, but so what? People of any group aren't a monolith. Even if a majority of people from a certain group believe something that doesn't mean they speak for that group, or that they even represent that group. \n\n\n- If the majority of a group doesn't represent that group... Who does?\n\n- Madara said that not a single member of his clan supported him in his uprising and they all turned their backs on him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Even Tobirama, the Bull Connor of the Leaf Village, said they had this wrong. The Uchiha are most inclined to love\n\nHe never said that this was wrong lol.\nHe said that it's wrong the saying that *the Senju love more intensely than the Uchiha*.\n\nHe said that the Uchiha love more but that once they lose the thing they love they start losing it little by little and the physical manifestation of that is the Sharingan.\nThe more the lose it, the more strong they get.\n\n\n\n\n\n>Literally what Hashirama and the racist- I mean Tobirama said. And just because Obito said it was right...so what?\n\nWow, we have abandoned any perception of neutrality. We just went full racist Tobirama meme.\n\nYou don't have to believe it just because Obito supports it, it's simply a curiosity, there's enough evidence for it enough. Starting for the fact that both Black Zetsu and Indra forced the wrong path onto the Uchiha.\nThis is the same clan that used to kill each other for their eyes and all that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>So I'm simply going to say, \"Alfonso the Wise\" of Castille. There are others, but he's the least controversial, safest bet, and the one I'm most familiar with since I wrote my graduating paper on him and his political goals for my BA in History. \n\n\nI did ask you for ten. You only give me one.\nThe one you think it's the most morally good. Which is someone that forced ethnic cleansing on his lands...  If they are controversial then you know already that they are not morally good lol.\nYou either are confusing morally with great ruler or you simply felt the need to answer.\n\n\n\nI ask you again, what morally good choice did Madara ever do in his quest for power?\n\n\n\n>Do you really not think people living in a dream world where, as far they know, they get everything they want, never have to worry about conflict (unless they want it, in which case it only happens in their mind and nobody actually dies), and the real world is left to nature is not an objectively good thing? By all manners that we quantify \"goodness\", that hits the mark.\n\nLol no, I think that a world of sleeping slaves that are forced to be drugged forever without having any experience whatsoever except that of their dreams.\nNo, dreaming forever is not good. It's hell for me.\nIf you believe that living your life in a comatose sleep is the ultimate goal, by all means do that. Just don't **force it** on the rest of us. That's something Madara ever understood either, diplomacy and free will.",

There is going to be a lot of insight into the First Shinobi World War, and not just through flashbacks and exposition but possibly through an entire Arc similar to the way Kakashi's backstory was flushed out. Going even further back, there will also be more detail given to the warring states period, because I feel like the dynamics of the different Clans in that era are fuzzy at best.",

I assumed it was a joke, like \u201cimagine he went through all that and still didn\u2019t get Sharingan lol\u201d. But go off.\n\nAnd he really didn\u2019t get it from being tortured honestly. 1st tomoe maybe but it could be argued it was because he saw Itachi crying and was heartbroken over his brother not only killing his clan but also losing the person he looked up to most. 2nd tomoe was protecting Naruto, 3rd tomoe was fighting Naruto, and MS was learning the truth about Itachi. So even if you argue that 1st tomoe was because Itachi tortured him the rest of its development was because of his positive attachments. Clearly torturing him was not the best way to develop the eyes, Itachi admits as much before he gets released from Edo Tensei.",

He could have at least left the fucking children that posed absolutely no threat to anyone alive.

I don\u2019t think anyone thinks Danzo was a good guy, and a large chunk of the fan base thinks the 3rd Hokage was not only the worst Hokage but pretty shit at his job in general. He was far to affected by his emotions IMO, and he repeatedly let them affect his judgement in the worst ways possible. Then you have Danzo who was the exact opposite end of that scale. The most ironic part being that they both thought they were doing the right thing, and both consistently chose the worst ways to go about it.",

This dude was like rock lee levels of loser at first. Not to mention a child of war. He had no family we know of and the only people that were constantly in his life were kakashi, rin and minato. But really the only one who is always supportive of him was rin. But as soon as his relationship with Kakashi starts looking up he gets it taken away by the boulder. Now imagine being alone in a cave for months with the only thing that's keeping you going being your best friend and your crush. And all the while an old man is telling you to give up on your life that has been crap up until now because he can literally give you your ideal life if you follow him. Then everything hes was looking forward to is just ruined. It wasnt entirely rins death that did it. It was a slow buildup in his life with only one good experience giving him hope and it was taken away. Ofc hes gonna go to madara. And its not like he didnt have inner turmoil. He probably had a lot of it but like shown in the war he just pushes it back because hes gonna make a better world so why bother himself with this ones issues. Its actually one of the saddest stories for me. He was a child and had everything he loved taken away and unlike kakashi, naruto, or even really sasuke he had no positive support group. Only the promise of a better life from madara",

I wish his change to the dark side was as gradual as it was during his development to seeing rin and that the manga actually showed how he might have been disgusted about what he was becoming for a short time, only THEN to be reassured by madara that his path was \u201crighteous\u201d\n\n>! Don\u2019t get me wrong, the masked man is the coolest villain ever, but it just feels so outlandish a kid turns so cold so quickly, especially since he\u2019s a KID. !< \n\nEven if madara was evil, he had complex ideologies and had multiple experiences and influence to drive him to what he became. !>Obito saw his love interest die and just turned to the dark side.

He then was forced away from them all, and Subject to Madara brainwashing him to try and believe he was making a better world. Given his life I would understand if he agreed right then, but because he was a 'good guy' at that point in time he consistently refused. Madara's entire point was this world only brings suffering, obito holding on to the few people he cared for refused to believe this. Then he immediately sees one of them die, at the hands on another, while the last (minato) who has the capability to stop them fails to come.  \n\nSuddenly madaras points about this world being horrible ring true. Yes that moment cracked him, but it was only due to the build up of everything beforehand. Obito was as idealistic as they come in the show, he was naruto before naruto. To see him break was rough but understandable\n\nAlso, Haku/kimimaro never had any hesitance when killing for zabuza/orochimaru, and in those cases it wasnt even mind set of 'for the greater good' it was just I owe this person my life now I will do whatever they say. Yet they get no shit for this when obito does despite he himself actually believing that he will make a better world for everyone.",

We can infer how he felt by the his actions during the war arc and how all that previous trauma had added up. We literally do the exact same thing with madara. The only seriously bad experiences actually shown for madara are his brother izuna dying and maybe the showing of war. The rest is off screen stuff just like obito.\nAnd the fact that he is a kid only makes it more believable. Kids are impressionable. And after an experience like being crushed alive and taken away from all friends and loved ones for an extended period of time, yeah, hes gonna listen to the one dude telling him to give up on life. That brainwashing is only enhanced by rin dying. Hes just an impressionable kid that would do anything to get back to how things were before being crushed. Madara would have given that to him. I think thats pretty reasonable for a kid.\nAnd just cause war and death were frequent doesnt mean that it doesnt traumatize people. By saying that you literally undermine madaras motives as well.",

He sees the underlying social distrust the village has of the Uchiha. Which can be seen when he tells Hashirama that he knows Tobirama will be the second Hokage, and how the villagers, despite Madara being just as integral to the founding of the village, are scared of him. And then, just as he said would happen, Tobirama becomes Hokage and goes and segregates the village. Putting place a secret state-sanctioned monitoring system to watch the Uchiha.  And as the years pass, and as villages modernized and grew into more formal states, the darker underbellies of govt started to emerge as we see in the Foundation where all types of evil shit happens. And none of this actually stops wars as was the point in Villages in the first place. Villages still distrust each other and go to war with each other. Only this time it isn't small clans, but larger, formal militaries with different powerful clans working together to kill each other.. Madara may have not know exactly how it would play out, but he really was right about the Villages not being enough. \n\n>swearing to protect the Leaf\n\n\nYes initially, but then as I just laid out, he realized Villages weren't going to be enough. His main objective was to attain peace. \n\n>being power hungry\n\n\nYes, I agree. No where did I say he wasn't power hungry. But being power hungry in itself is not a bad thing. Power is a morally neutral thing. The pursuit of power is also morally neutral. The ideology, the goal, or what someone or something wants to DO with power is what can be judged in moralistic terms. \n\n>he's delusional\n\n\nNo, actually it's quite rational. You CANNOT look at the Shinobi world- which is BY DEFINITION ruled by deceit, killing, betrayal, and quite honestly eugenics, and tell me that the idea that maybe shinobi don't actually know what  is in their best interest is wrong. Any peace treaty is only momentary and can be broken at literally any moment. A world that makes the Foundation a rational institution is fundamentally morally bad. Look at what was done (by state-sanctioned action mind you) to Itachi, the Uchiha, Kisame, Zabuza, Rin, Bee (and all of the Jinchuriki)- and tell me That world is a rational world where the shinobi that fight and defend the existence of such a world have an understanding of peace. \n\nUndermining the village, trying to kill Hashirama to take his power, sacrificing the Jinchuriki to fulfill his plan, throwing the world into destruction before it can become peaceful- I don't deny any of that. But that isn't my point. My point is that his larger goal, whether you think it makes sense or not, is quite rational and justified when you look at the context of his existence. You may think that individual free will trumps the betterment of the world at large, or that his pursuit of power led to morally bad things, and I'm not even trying to debate that with you, but you CANNOT simply look at Madara and say, \"he's a dumb despot that just wants power\".",

                                                    "body": ">He knows that the village system won't work to begin with.\n\nHe didn't \"know\" it yet. He was pretty happy to run things when Hashirama told him he would be Kage.\n\nHe was more pessimistic once he didn't get the power tho.\n\n\n\n\n\n>He sees the underlying social distrust the village has of the Uchiha.\n\nNot the Uchiha... With **him**. \nHe did make everything worse for the Uchiha tho, to the point that no one in the Leaf would have ever suspected of them during the Nine Tails incident if Madara hadn't repeatedly attacked the village with Kurama.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> Which can be seen when he tells Hashirama that he knows Tobirama will be the second Hokage, and how the villagers, despite Madara being just as integral to the founding of the village, are scared of him.\n\n\nMadara is again making his prophecies become true... Hashirama tells him that he will personally advocate for Madara and the latter refuses, leaves the village and attack it, repeatedly, Tobirama ofc runs against no one and gets the position... And it's supposed to be the ultimate \"see they were out to get us\" moment.\n\n\nPeople didn't start distrusting Madara, and when I say people I too am talking about the Uchiha clan, till Madara started with his separatist talks. \n\nTime after time, Madara says that the worst scenario is going to happen and then goes out his way to make everything in his hand for that scenario to occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>And then, just as he said would happen, Tobirama becomes Hokage and goes and segregates the village\n\nThat's not what happens.\n\n\n\n\n\n>Putting place a secret state-sanctioned monitoring system to watch the Uchiha. \n\nWell duh, there's this thing called the Uchiha curse of hatred.\nEven Obito acknowledged that fact. Not keeping an eye on the Uchiha is downright irresponsible. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n>And as the years pass, and as villages modernized and grew into more formal states, the darker underbellies of govt started to emerge as we see in the Foundation where all types of evil shit happens. And none of this actually stops wars as was the point in Villages in the first place. Villages still distrust each other and go to war with each other. Only this time it isn't small clans, but larger, formal militaries with different powerful clans working together to kill each other.. Madara may have not know exactly how it would play out, but he really was right about the Villages not being enough. \n\nLol and who was the one who actually did everything in his hand to **destroy** any type of trust between the villages, allowing the distrust to fester lol.\nDo I need to remind you that Madara, while still affiliated to the Leaf, entered on a conflict of aggression against the Stone, badly hurting the 2nd Tsuchikage??\n\nAre we forgetting that Madara's response to \"dude wtf are you violating the peace accords Hashirama signed and promised\" was **there's no peace accord, there's no alliance YOU WILL BOW TO THE POWER OF THE LEAF**.\nAre we forgetting that that's a lesson that both Mu and Onoki always carried and influenced their decision making for 60 plus years till the War Arc??\n\nMadara is nothing more than an arsonist firefighter. An expert only on shitting on the bed to complain about its smell.\n\n\n\n\n>Yes initially, but then as I just laid out, he realized Villages weren't going to be enough. His main objective was to attain peace. \n\nNope, he realized that he would never be in power and got salty and then got duped by Black Zetsu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Yes, I agree. No where did I say he wasn't power hungry. But being power hungry in itself is not a bad thing. Power is a morally neutral thing. The pursuit of power is also morally neutral. The ideology, the goal, or what someone or something wants to DO with power is what can be judged in moralistic terms. \n\nWe're going with the moral relativism now huh...\nBeing power hungry is a bad thing. It means that you trample everything and anyone in your pursue for **dominance**. Sounds like our man. \nBeing power hungry has never being morally neutral. Power hungry is a very negative trait by itself.\nCan you tell me ten power hungry people in history that you can paint as good guys?\nCan you tell me a single good thing Madara did in his crazy pursuit for power?\n\n\n\n\n\n>No, actually it's quite rational.\n\nNo, it's delusional af. There are several reasons why it's delusional but the more obvious of them all is that his peace ended up being the ultimate con.\nSo, only for that it's pure delusion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>You CANNOT look at the Shinobi world- which is BY DEFINITION ruled by deceit, killing, betrayal, and quite honestly eugenics, and tell me that the idea that maybe shinobi don't actually know what is in their best interest is wrong.\n\nNo, but a I can look at *MADARA* who is **BY  DEFINITION**, murderous, deceitful, traitorous and quite honestly fond of eugenics, \"weak people disgust me\" and all that, and tell you that this fucker doesn't know what's best for himself let alone for the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n>A world that makes the Foundation a rational institution is fundamentally morally bad. Look at what was done (by state-sanctioned action mind you) to Itachi, the Uchiha, Kisame, Zabuza, Rin, Bee (and all of the Jinchuriki)- and tell me That world is a rational world where the shinobi that fight and defend the existence of such a world have an understanding of peace. \n\nNo ever said it's a good world. \nMy point is, Madara had a hand in starting that world. Madara had a hand in most of this affairs, he and Tobi quite literally controlled Kirigakure and Madara got enough pull in Kirigakure to orchestrate Rin's kidnapping and death to finish his brainwashing on Obito.\n\nMy point other point is that any solution Madara offers, based on his faulty record is suspicious at best, a worst deal than we had at worst.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>But that isn't my point. My point is that his larger goal, whether you think it makes sense or not, is quite rational and justified when you look at the context of his existence. \n\n\nIt's neither rational nor it's justified.\nBut it does make sense. Madara was always an arrogant fella, it's completely logical that he read a stone that promised him that he could be ninja Jesus and jumped on the opportunity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>You may think that individual free will trumps the betterment of the world at large\n\nWhat betterment of the world? \n\n\n\n\n\n>but you CANNOT simply look at Madara and say, \"he's a dumb despot that just wants power\".\n\nWhy yes I can.\nBut he's not only a dumb despot that just wants power. He's a dumb, megalomaniac, delusional despot that just wants his way and refuses to even consider for a moment that he might be wrong. \nThat's why he was so easy to manipulate.",

I did not mean when Hashirama first proposes the Village system, or even when their village starts to take off, I mean when the village starts to take form, it was still in it's feudal stages, and then after he reads the Uchiha tablet.\n\n And before you oversimplify the tablet reading, keep in mind this is a universe where there are ancient all-powerful magic beasts, ancient super-moves are written on ancient scrolls, the Sage of the 6thfold Path is literally incarnated, Princess Kaguya is a demon monster, and the Shinto Pantheon are materialized in super techniques. So in that context, believing an ancient tablet makes a lot of fucking sense.\n\n\\>Blaming Madara for the failure of the Village system because he fucked around too much\n\nAgain, Im not saying Madara didn't do bad things, including sowing distrust amongst the villages, but if you think that HE'S the reason it didn't work, then idk if you're just incapable of larger critiques of structures in general, if you just refuse to, or if you are just are naive. The entire universe is based on the Sengoku Jidai, and Shinobi clans in service to feudal lords. In-universe, the legitimacy of the bigger villages is entirely based on having support from a feudal lord and protecting said feudal lord. Aside from the conflicts between rival villages rooted in rivalries between clans, there is also underlying conflicts in the Feudal Lords ever sought war between nations. Such a world would be in constant chaos without Madara or the Akatsuki. Just like the Sengoku period. So did Madara do a lot to sow divisions? Maybe. But you are naive if you think that would have made a larger difference. Hell, even at the first Kage summit, they were all in distrust and threatened the Sand Village with war for making a reasonable demand. No attempt to compromise, just \"we'll gang up on you\" until Hashirama had to cry to get them to at least talk to each other. \n\nYou say that Madara had a hand in creating that world, but he didn't. The machinations of such a world were already in existence way before Madara or Hashirama made the first Village. Madara may have taken some extreme steps, but war between Villages over Village politics or because of Feudal Lord demands are inevitable because of the very nature of the universe.\n\n\\>Disturst between the Uchiha and the larger village\n\nReally? Do you really think that the Uchiha would not have been persecuted had it not been for Madara? The ruling clan of the Village were the rival clan of the Uchiha, and they only formed a peace treaty because they had a Great Man of History in Hashirama. Tobirama disliked the Uchiha as a clan, talking in slurs at them, even after his death when he saw Sasuke. Sure he had \"one of the good ones\" in his one Uchiha friend, but that doesn't negate his larger distrust of the Uchiha. And when even an evil but analytical motherfucker like Orochimaru can say, \"your policies caused the uprising\", you know there's something to it. \n\nAlso, I understand that members of the Uchiha also distrusted Madara, but so what? People of any group aren't a monolith. Even if a majority of people from a certain group believe something that doesn't mean they speak for that group, or that they even represent that group. \n\n\\>the Uchiha \"Curse of Hatred\"\n\nReally? If you're going to cite this as justification for their segregation and constant surveillance, then I'm not gonna bother with this debate after this. Even Tobirama, the Bull Connor of the Leaf Village, said they had this wrong. The Uchiha are most inclined to love. Literally what Hashirama and the racist- I mean Tobirama said. And just because Obito said it was right...so what?\n\n\\>Philosophy 301\n\nYou used the term \"moral relativism\", and assuming you really do have an understanding of that term, then I'm going to assume you have some real familiarity with philosophy. And if you do, then you know that in order for something to actually be a Universal, then it, by definition, must be provable in all cases. All. Every. It doesn't have to be disproven in 10, 100, 1,000 etc cases, only ONE. This is Philosophy 300 level stuff. So I'm simply going to say, \"Alfonso the Wise\" of Castille. There are others, but he's the least controversial, safest bet, and the one I'm most familiar with since I wrote my graduating paper on him and his political goals for my BA in History. \n\n\\>What betterment of the world?\n\nDo you really not think people living in a dream world where, as far they know, they get everything they want, never have to worry about conflict (unless they want it, in which case it only happens in their mind and nobody actually dies), and the real world is left to nature is not an objectively good thing?

That's your problem, you assume what I don't say.\nI didn't say that the village system didn't have massive problems from the get go or that it would fail eventually.\nI'm arguing that Madara never gave the system a chance once he became convinced he wouldn't be the one on top. I'm telling you that Madara did absolutely everything in his hand to sow distrust and resentment.\nThat Madara became such a threat for **everyone** that even a century after his death, the mere thought that he was behind the Akatsuki sent every big nation in a frenzy and moved them to war.\nIt is a fact that Madara try to fullfil his own prophecy. So it's obvious that he shouldn't get bragging rights when it becomes true.\n\nYou're right that in the first Kage summit, things were starting to get heated. But Hashirama pleaded with them and they relented, they actually did try to give peace a chance. The one who backstabbed that peace was Madara, he was the one who went around bullying other nations. And wether you want to admit it or not, we know that his encounter with Onoki shattered the latter and changed his worldview entirely... This man would rule Iwakagure for sixty plus years.\n\nHow can his blabbering of peace fit with his warmongering and imperialistic attitudes?? It can't.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>You say that Madara had a hand in creating that world, but he didn't. The machinations of such a world were already in existence way before Madara or Hashirama made the first Village. Madara may have taken some extreme steps, but war between Villages over Village politics or because of Feudal Lord demands are inevitable because of the very nature of the universe.\n\nOh he very much did, this is a fact. It's likely that Peace wouldn't have lasted forever?? Sure, no peace is eternal.\nIt's a fact that there was peace and Madara went screwing things up as per usual. \nMadara and Hashirama changed and shaped the world when they created the village system. \nWe have people struggling to achieve peace and then we have Madara the imperialist warmonger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Really? Do you really think that the Uchiha would not have been persecuted had it not been for Madara?\n\nYes. The very reason Tobirama was wary of them was because he knew another Madara could rise among them.\nThe very reason why decades later the higher ups move against them is because they are convinced that an Uchiha had attacked the Leaf with Kurama, in trust **Madara's disciple had done so, knowing he would frame his clan**. The only reason they have this suspicion is because Madara did in the past. \n\n\n\n>The ruling clan of the Village were the rival clan of the Uchiha, and they only formed a peace treaty because they had a Great Man of History in Hashirama\n\nThat's the thing... **They were not the ruling clan**.\nOne of their own became Hokage, that's very different from the whole clan ruling.\n\nTobirama was also in favour for peace, even since he was child. He went on record insulting the adults, both Uchiha and Senju, and arguing that if they really wanted peace, they should forget the bad blood, sign accords and stick to them.\n\n\n\n>Tobirama disliked the Uchiha as a clan, talking in slurs at them, even after his death when he saw Sasuke. \n\nNo such thing happened.\nHe said that he wasn't surprised that an Uchiha associated himself with scoundrel like Orochimaru.\n\n\n\n\n\n>Sure he had \"one of the good ones\" in his one Uchiha friend, but that doesn't negate his larger distrust of the Uchiha.\n\nHe never denies that one. \nHe also explains why he was wary of them. It's obvious that any clan cursed with being genetically predisposed to go mad and the crazier the got the more op they became was a motive for worrying.\nSeems funny that you were talking big about realpolitik a paragraph ago but went full Hashirama here.\n\n\n\n\n>And when even an evil but analytical motherfucker like Orochimaru can say, \"your policies caused the uprising\", you know there's something to it. \n\nNothing Orochimaru said made any sense. \nThis is highlighted with the fact that the Uchiha actually loved their position as Military Police.\nOrochi also act like people naturally distrust officers and it isn't their actions what turn people on them.\nPeople also forget that Orochi also said that  the Uchiha became super arrogant due their power and position... \n\nWe can discuss this in full but no, his policies had nothing to do with it. \n\n\n\n>Also, I understand that members of the Uchiha also distrusted Madara, but so what? People of any group aren't a monolith. Even if a majority of people from a certain group believe something that doesn't mean they speak for that group, or that they even represent that group. \n\n\n- If the majority of a group doesn't represent that group... Who does?\n\n- Madara said that not a single member of his clan supported him in his uprising and they all turned their backs on him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Even Tobirama, the Bull Connor of the Leaf Village, said they had this wrong. The Uchiha are most inclined to love\n\nHe never said that this was wrong lol.\nHe said that it's wrong the saying that *the Senju love more intensely than the Uchiha*.\n\nHe said that the Uchiha love more but that once they lose the thing they love they start losing it little by little and the physical manifestation of that is the Sharingan.\nThe more the lose it, the more strong they get.\n\n\n\n\n\n>Literally what Hashirama and the racist- I mean Tobirama said. And just because Obito said it was right...so what?\n\nWow, we have abandoned any perception of neutrality. We just went full racist Tobirama meme.\n\nYou don't have to believe it just because Obito supports it, it's simply a curiosity, there's enough evidence for it enough. Starting for the fact that both Black Zetsu and Indra forced the wrong path onto the Uchiha.\nThis is the same clan that used to kill each other for their eyes and all that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>So I'm simply going to say, \"Alfonso the Wise\" of Castille. There are others, but he's the least controversial, safest bet, and the one I'm most familiar with since I wrote my graduating paper on him and his political goals for my BA in History. \n\n\nI did ask you for ten. You only give me one.\nThe one you think it's the most morally good. Which is someone that forced ethnic cleansing on his lands...  If they are controversial then you know already that they are not morally good lol.\nYou either are confusing morally with great ruler or you simply felt the need to answer.\n\n\n\nI ask you again, what morally good choice did Madara ever do in his quest for power?\n\n\n\n>Do you really not think people living in a dream world where, as far they know, they get everything they want, never have to worry about conflict (unless they want it, in which case it only happens in their mind and nobody actually dies), and the real world is left to nature is not an objectively good thing? By all manners that we quantify \"goodness\", that hits the mark.\n\nLol no, I think that a world of sleeping slaves that are forced to be drugged forever without having any experience whatsoever except that of their dreams.\nNo, dreaming forever is not good. It's hell for me.\nIf you believe that living your life in a comatose sleep is the ultimate goal, by all means do that. Just don't **force it** on the rest of us. That's something Madara ever understood either, diplomacy and free will.",

Going even further back, there will also be more detail given to the warring states period, because I feel like the dynamics of the different Clans in that era are fuzzy at best.",

He literally just wants to live forever so that he can continue studying the world as it is.

So even if you argue that 1st tomoe was because Itachi tortured him the rest of its development was because of his positive attachments. Clearly torturing him was not the best way to develop the eyes, Itachi admits as much before he gets released from Edo Tensei.",

He could have instead killed just his father and his diehard supporters and taken leadership of the clan. He could have just killed the ninja in the clan. He could have at least left the fucking children that posed absolutely no threat to anyone alive. Instead he said hmmm I either commit mass murder of my own clan down to the last man woman and child regardless of wether or not they know how to fight or are even capable of fighting or know anything about the coup at all, or I decide to turn against the village my clan lives in.

I wish his change to the dark side was as gradual as it was during his development to seeing rin and that the manga actually showed how he might have been disgusted about what he was becoming for a short time, only THEN to be reassured by madara that his path was \u201crighteous\u201d\n\n>!

He then was forced away from them all, and Subject to Madara brainwashing him to try and believe he was making a better world. Given his life I would understand if he agreed right then, but because he was a 'good guy' at that point in time he consistently refused. Madara's entire point was this world only brings suffering, obito holding on to the few people he cared for refused to believe this. Then he immediately sees one of them die, at the hands on another, while the last (minato) who has the capability to stop them fails to come.  \n\nSuddenly madaras points about this world being horrible ring true. Yes that moment cracked him, but it was only due to the build up of everything beforehand. Obito was as idealistic as they come in the show, he was naruto before naruto. To see him break was rough but understandable\n\nAlso, Haku/kimimaro never had any hesitance when killing for zabuza/orochimaru, and in those cases it wasnt even mind set of 'for the greater good' it was just I owe this person my life now I will do whatever they say. Yet they get no shit for this when obito does despite he himself actually believing that he will make a better world for everyone.",

We can infer how he felt by the his actions during the war arc and how all that previous trauma had added up. We literally do the exact same thing with madara. The only seriously bad experiences actually shown for madara are his brother izuna dying and maybe the showing of war. The rest is off screen stuff just like obito.\nAnd the fact that he is a kid only makes it more believable. Kids are impressionable. And after an experience like being crushed alive and taken away from all friends and loved ones for an extended period of time, yeah, hes gonna listen to the one dude telling him to give up on life. That brainwashing is only enhanced by rin dying. Hes just an impressionable kid that would do anything to get back to how things were before being crushed. Madara would have given that to him. I think thats pretty reasonable for a kid.\nAnd just cause war and death were frequent doesnt mean that it doesnt traumatize people. By saying that you literally undermine madaras motives as well.",

His main objective was to attain peace. \n\n>being power hungry\n\n\nYes, I agree. No where did I say he wasn't power hungry. But being power hungry in itself is not a bad thing. Power is a morally neutral thing. The pursuit of power is also morally neutral. The ideology, the goal, or what someone or something wants to DO with power is what can be judged in moralistic terms. \n\n>he's delusional\n\n\nNo, actually it's quite rational. You CANNOT look at the Shinobi world- which is BY DEFINITION ruled by deceit, killing, betrayal, and quite honestly eugenics, and tell me that the idea that maybe shinobi don't actually know what  is in their best interest is wrong. Any peace treaty is only momentary and can be broken at literally any moment. A world that makes the Foundation a rational institution is fundamentally morally bad. Look at what was done (by state-sanctioned action mind you) to Itachi, the Uchiha, Kisame, Zabuza, Rin, Bee (and all of the Jinchuriki)- and tell me That world is a rational world where the shinobi that fight and defend the existence of such a world have an understanding of peace. \n\nUndermining the village, trying to kill Hashirama to take his power, sacrificing the Jinchuriki to fulfill his plan, throwing the world into destruction before it can become peaceful- I don't deny any of that. But that isn't my point. My point is that his larger goal, whether you think it makes sense or not, is quite rational and justified when you look at the context of his existence. You may think that individual free will trumps the betterment of the world at large, or that his pursuit of power led to morally bad things, and I'm not even trying to debate that with you, but you CANNOT simply look at Madara and say, \"he's a dumb despot that just wants power\".",

                                                    "body": "Let me clarify what I mean when I say to \"begin with\". I did not mean when Hashirama first proposes the Village system, or even when their village starts to take off, I mean when the village starts to take form, it was still in it's feudal stages, and then after he reads the Uchiha tablet.\n\n And before you oversimplify the tablet reading, keep in mind this is a universe where there are ancient all-powerful magic beasts, ancient super-moves are written on ancient scrolls, the Sage of the 6thfold Path is literally incarnated, Princess Kaguya is a demon monster, and the Shinto Pantheon are materialized in super techniques. So in that context, believing an ancient tablet makes a lot of fucking sense.\n\n\\>Blaming Madara for the failure of the Village system because he fucked around too much\n\nAgain, Im not saying Madara didn't do bad things, including sowing distrust amongst the villages, but if you think that HE'S the reason it didn't work, then idk if you're just incapable of larger critiques of structures in general, if you just refuse to, or if you are just are naive. The entire universe is based on the Sengoku Jidai, and Shinobi clans in service to feudal lords. In-universe, the legitimacy of the bigger villages is entirely based on having support from a feudal lord and protecting said feudal lord. Aside from the conflicts between rival villages rooted in rivalries between clans, there is also underlying conflicts in the Feudal Lords ever sought war between nations. Such a world would be in constant chaos without Madara or the Akatsuki. Just like the Sengoku period. So did Madara do a lot to sow divisions? Maybe. But you are naive if you think that would have made a larger difference. Hell, even at the first Kage summit, they were all in distrust and threatened the Sand Village with war for making a reasonable demand. No attempt to compromise, just \"we'll gang up on you\" until Hashirama had to cry to get them to at least talk to each other. \n\nYou say that Madara had a hand in creating that world, but he didn't. The machinations of such a world were already in existence way before Madara or Hashirama made the first Village. Madara may have taken some extreme steps, but war between Villages over Village politics or because of Feudal Lord demands are inevitable because of the very nature of the universe.\n\n\\>Disturst between the Uchiha and the larger village\n\nReally? Do you really think that the Uchiha would not have been persecuted had it not been for Madara? The ruling clan of the Village were the rival clan of the Uchiha, and they only formed a peace treaty because they had a Great Man of History in Hashirama. Tobirama disliked the Uchiha as a clan, talking in slurs at them, even after his death when he saw Sasuke. Sure he had \"one of the good ones\" in his one Uchiha friend, but that doesn't negate his larger distrust of the Uchiha. And when even an evil but analytical motherfucker like Orochimaru can say, \"your policies caused the uprising\", you know there's something to it. \n\nAlso, I understand that members of the Uchiha also distrusted Madara, but so what? People of any group aren't a monolith. Even if a majority of people from a certain group believe something that doesn't mean they speak for that group, or that they even represent that group. \n\n\\>the Uchiha \"Curse of Hatred\"\n\nReally? If you're going to cite this as justification for their segregation and constant surveillance, then I'm not gonna bother with this debate after this. Even Tobirama, the Bull Connor of the Leaf Village, said they had this wrong. The Uchiha are most inclined to love. Literally what Hashirama and the racist- I mean Tobirama said. And just because Obito said it was right...so what?\n\n\\>Philosophy 301\n\nYou used the term \"moral relativism\", and assuming you really do have an understanding of that term, then I'm going to assume you have some real familiarity with philosophy. And if you do, then you know that in order for something to actually be a Universal, then it, by definition, must be provable in all cases. All. Every. It doesn't have to be disproven in 10, 100, 1,000 etc cases, only ONE. This is Philosophy 300 level stuff. So I'm simply going to say, \"Alfonso the Wise\" of Castille. There are others, but he's the least controversial, safest bet, and the one I'm most familiar with since I wrote my graduating paper on him and his political goals for my BA in History. \n\n\\>What betterment of the world?\n\nDo you really not think people living in a dream world where, as far they know, they get everything they want, never have to worry about conflict (unless they want it, in which case it only happens in their mind and nobody actually dies), and the real world is left to nature is not an objectively good thing? By all manners that we quantify \"goodness\", that hits the mark.",

                                                            "body": ">Let me clarify what I mean when I say to \"begin with\". I did not mean when Hashirama first proposes the Village system, or even when their village starts to take off, I mean when the village starts to take form, it was still in it's feudal stages, and then after he reads the Uchiha tablet.\n\n\nThis only happens because he believes he's unlikely to be chosen over Tobirama and after he fails with his separatist plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>And before you oversimplify the tablet reading, keep in mind this is a universe where there are ancient all-powerful magic beasts, ancient super-moves are written on ancient scrolls, the Sage of the 6thfold Path is literally incarnated, Princess Kaguya is a demon monster, and the Shinto Pantheon are materialized in super techniques. So in that context, believing an ancient tablet makes a lot of fucking sense.\n\n\nMost of those things are myths by the time Madara got to read them, this mythological gods have come and gone a millennia ago.\nIn fact most ninja do not believe them, hell they don't believe the extent of Hashirama's power who lived and died a century ago.\n\n\nThat's the thing, putting your trust in a old stone that may or may not be written by an ancient God with unknown purposes and deciding to put your faith in it without any type of rational thinking.\n\nThat's why he obviously gets backstabbed himself.\n\n\n\n\n\n>Again, Im not saying Madara didn't do bad things, including sowing distrust amongst the villages, but if you think that HE'S the reason it didn't work, then idk if you're just incapable of larger critiques of structures in general, if you just refuse to, or if you are just are naive. The entire universe is based on the Sengoku Jidai, and Shinobi clans in service to feudal lords. In-universe, the legitimacy of the bigger villages is entirely based on having support from a feudal lord and protecting said feudal lord. Aside from the conflicts between rival villages rooted in rivalries between clans, there is also underlying conflicts in the Feudal Lords ever sought war between nations. Such a world would be in constant chaos without Madara or the Akatsuki. Just like the Sengoku period. So did Madara do a lot to sow divisions? Maybe. But you are naive if you think that would have made a larger difference. Hell, even at the first Kage summit, they were all in distrust and threatened the Sand Village with war for making a reasonable demand. No attempt to compromise, just \"we'll gang up on you\" until Hashirama had to cry to get them to at least talk to each other. \n\n\nSee?? That's your problem, you assume what I don't say.\nI didn't say that the village system didn't have massive problems from the get go or that it would fail eventually.\nI'm arguing that Madara never gave the system a chance once he became convinced he wouldn't be the one on top. I'm telling you that Madara did absolutely everything in his hand to sow distrust and resentment.\nThat Madara became such a threat for **everyone** that even a century after his death, the mere thought that he was behind the Akatsuki sent every big nation in a frenzy and moved them to war.\nIt is a fact that Madara try to fullfil his own prophecy. So it's obvious that he shouldn't get bragging rights when it becomes true.\n\nYou're right that in the first Kage summit, things were starting to get heated. But Hashirama pleaded with them and they relented, they actually did try to give peace a chance. The one who backstabbed that peace was Madara, he was the one who went around bullying other nations. And wether you want to admit it or not, we know that his encounter with Onoki shattered the latter and changed his worldview entirely... This man would rule Iwakagure for sixty plus years.\n\nHow can his blabbering of peace fit with his warmongering and imperialistic attitudes?? It can't.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>You say that Madara had a hand in creating that world, but he didn't. The machinations of such a world were already in existence way before Madara or Hashirama made the first Village. Madara may have taken some extreme steps, but war between Villages over Village politics or because of Feudal Lord demands are inevitable because of the very nature of the universe.\n\nOh he very much did, this is a fact. It's likely that Peace wouldn't have lasted forever?? Sure, no peace is eternal.\nIt's a fact that there was peace and Madara went screwing things up as per usual. \nMadara and Hashirama changed and shaped the world when they created the village system. \nWe have people struggling to achieve peace and then we have Madara the imperialist warmonger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Really? Do you really think that the Uchiha would not have been persecuted had it not been for Madara?\n\nYes. The very reason Tobirama was wary of them was because he knew another Madara could rise among them.\nThe very reason why decades later the higher ups move against them is because they are convinced that an Uchiha had attacked the Leaf with Kurama, in trust **Madara's disciple had done so, knowing he would frame his clan**. The only reason they have this suspicion is because Madara did in the past. \n\n\n\n>The ruling clan of the Village were the rival clan of the Uchiha, and they only formed a peace treaty because they had a Great Man of History in Hashirama\n\nThat's the thing... **They were not the ruling clan**.\nOne of their own became Hokage, that's very different from the whole clan ruling.\n\nTobirama was also in favour for peace, even since he was child. He went on record insulting the adults, both Uchiha and Senju, and arguing that if they really wanted peace, they should forget the bad blood, sign accords and stick to them.\n\n\n\n>Tobirama disliked the Uchiha as a clan, talking in slurs at them, even after his death when he saw Sasuke. \n\nNo such thing happened.\nHe said that he wasn't surprised that an Uchiha associated himself with scoundrel like Orochimaru.\n\n\n\n\n\n>Sure he had \"one of the good ones\" in his one Uchiha friend, but that doesn't negate his larger distrust of the Uchiha.\n\nHe never denies that one. \nHe also explains why he was wary of them. It's obvious that any clan cursed with being genetically predisposed to go mad and the crazier the got the more op they became was a motive for worrying.\nSeems funny that you were talking big about realpolitik a paragraph ago but went full Hashirama here.\n\n\n\n\n>And when even an evil but analytical motherfucker like Orochimaru can say, \"your policies caused the uprising\", you know there's something to it. \n\nNothing Orochimaru said made any sense. \nThis is highlighted with the fact that the Uchiha actually loved their position as Military Police.\nOrochi also act like people naturally distrust officers and it isn't their actions what turn people on them.\nPeople also forget that Orochi also said that  the Uchiha became super arrogant due their power and position... \n\nWe can discuss this in full but no, his policies had nothing to do with it. \n\n\n\n>Also, I understand that members of the Uchiha also distrusted Madara, but so what? People of any group aren't a monolith. Even if a majority of people from a certain group believe something that doesn't mean they speak for that group, or that they even represent that group. \n\n\n- If the majority of a group doesn't represent that group... Who does?\n\n- Madara said that not a single member of his clan supported him in his uprising and they all turned their backs on him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Even Tobirama, the Bull Connor of the Leaf Village, said they had this wrong. The Uchiha are most inclined to love\n\nHe never said that this was wrong lol.\nHe said that it's wrong the saying that *the Senju love more intensely than the Uchiha*.\n\nHe said that the Uchiha love more but that once they lose the thing they love they start losing it little by little and the physical manifestation of that is the Sharingan.\nThe more the lose it, the more strong they get.\n\n\n\n\n\n>Literally what Hashirama and the racist- I mean Tobirama said. And just because Obito said it was right...so what?\n\nWow, we have abandoned any perception of neutrality. We just went full racist Tobirama meme.\n\nYou don't have to believe it just because Obito supports it, it's simply a curiosity, there's enough evidence for it enough. Starting for the fact that both Black Zetsu and Indra forced the wrong path onto the Uchiha.\nThis is the same clan that used to kill each other for their eyes and all that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>So I'm simply going to say, \"Alfonso the Wise\" of Castille. There are others, but he's the least controversial, safest bet, and the one I'm most familiar with since I wrote my graduating paper on him and his political goals for my BA in History. \n\n\nI did ask you for ten. You only give me one.\nThe one you think it's the most morally good. Which is someone that forced ethnic cleansing on his lands...  If they are controversial then you know already that they are not morally good lol.\nYou either are confusing morally with great ruler or you simply felt the need to answer.\n\n\n\nI ask you again, what morally good choice did Madara ever do in his quest for power?\n\n\n\n>Do you really not think people living in a dream world where, as far they know, they get everything they want, never have to worry about conflict (unless they want it, in which case it only happens in their mind and nobody actually dies), and the real world is left to nature is not an objectively good thing? By all manners that we quantify \"goodness\", that hits the mark.\n\nLol no, I think that a world of sleeping slaves that are forced to be drugged forever without having any experience whatsoever except that of their dreams.\nNo, dreaming forever is not good. It's hell for me.\nIf you believe that living your life in a comatose sleep is the ultimate goal, by all means do that. Just don't **force it** on the rest of us. That's something Madara ever understood either, diplomacy and free will.",

So even if you argue that 1st tomoe was because Itachi tortured him the rest of its development was because of his positive attachments. Clearly torturing him was not the best way to develop the eyes, Itachi admits as much before he gets released from Edo Tensei.",

He could have instead killed just his father and his diehard supporters and taken leadership of the clan. He could have just killed the ninja in the clan. He could have at least left the fucking children that posed absolutely no threat to anyone alive. Instead he said hmmm I either commit mass murder of my own clan down to the last man woman and child regardless of wether or not they know how to fight or are even capable of fighting or know anything about the coup at all, or I decide to turn against the village my clan lives in.

He was far to affected by his emotions IMO, and he repeatedly let them affect his judgement in the worst ways possible. Then you have Danzo who was the exact opposite end of that scale.

He then was forced away from them all, and Subject to Madara brainwashing him to try and believe he was making a better world. Given his life I would understand if he agreed right then, but because he was a 'good guy' at that point in time he consistently refused. Madara's entire point was this world only brings suffering, obito holding on to the few people he cared for refused to believe this. Then he immediately sees one of them die, at the hands on another, while the last (minato) who has the capability to stop them fails to come.  \n\nSuddenly madaras points about this world being horrible ring true. Yes that moment cracked him, but it was only due to the build up of everything beforehand. Obito was as idealistic as they come in the show, he was naruto before naruto. To see him break was rough but understandable\n\nAlso, Haku/kimimaro never had any hesitance when killing for zabuza/orochimaru, and in those cases it wasnt even mind set of 'for the greater good' it was just I owe this person my life now I will do whatever they say. Yet they get no shit for this when obito does despite he himself actually believing that he will make a better world for everyone.",

We can infer how he felt by the his actions during the war arc and how all that previous trauma had added up. We literally do the exact same thing with madara. The only seriously bad experiences actually shown for madara are his brother izuna dying and maybe the showing of war. The rest is off screen stuff just like obito.\nAnd the fact that he is a kid only makes it more believable. Kids are impressionable. And after an experience like being crushed alive and taken away from all friends and loved ones for an extended period of time, yeah, hes gonna listen to the one dude telling him to give up on life. That brainwashing is only enhanced by rin dying. Hes just an impressionable kid that would do anything to get back to how things were before being crushed. Madara would have given that to him. I think thats pretty reasonable for a kid.\nAnd just cause war and death were frequent doesnt mean that it doesnt traumatize people. By saying that you literally undermine madaras motives as well.",

Which can be seen when he tells Hashirama that he knows Tobirama will be the second Hokage, and how the villagers, despite Madara being just as integral to the founding of the village, are scared of him. And then, just as he said would happen, Tobirama becomes Hokage and goes and segregates the village. Putting place a secret state-sanctioned monitoring system to watch the Uchiha.  And as the years pass, and as villages modernized and grew into more formal states, the darker underbellies of govt started to emerge as we see in the Foundation where all types of evil shit happens. And none of this actually stops wars as was the point in Villages in the first place. Villages still distrust each other and go to war with each other. Only this time it isn't small clans, but larger, formal militaries with different powerful clans working together to kill each other.. Madara may have not know exactly how it would play out, but he really was right about the Villages not being enough. \n\n>swearing to protect the Leaf\n\n\nYes initially, but then as I just laid out, he realized Villages weren't going to be enough. His main objective was to attain peace. \n\n>being power hungry\n\n\nYes, I agree. No where did I say he wasn't power hungry. But being power hungry in itself is not a bad thing. Power is a morally neutral thing. The pursuit of power is also morally neutral. The ideology, the goal, or what someone or something wants to DO with power is what can be judged in moralistic terms. \n\n>he's delusional\n\n\nNo, actually it's quite rational. You CANNOT look at the Shinobi world- which is BY DEFINITION ruled by deceit, killing, betrayal, and quite honestly eugenics, and tell me that the idea that maybe shinobi don't actually know what  is in their best interest is wrong. Any peace treaty is only momentary and can be broken at literally any moment. A world that makes the Foundation a rational institution is fundamentally morally bad. Look at what was done (by state-sanctioned action mind you) to Itachi, the Uchiha, Kisame, Zabuza, Rin, Bee (and all of the Jinchuriki)- and tell me That world is a rational world where the shinobi that fight and defend the existence of such a world have an understanding of peace. \n\nUndermining the village, trying to kill Hashirama to take his power, sacrificing the Jinchuriki to fulfill his plan, throwing the world into destruction before it can become peaceful- I don't deny any of that. But that isn't my point. My point is that his larger goal, whether you think it makes sense or not, is quite rational and justified when you look at the context of his existence. You may think that individual free will trumps the betterment of the world at large, or that his pursuit of power led to morally bad things, and I'm not even trying to debate that with you, but you CANNOT simply look at Madara and say, \"he's a dumb despot that just wants power\".",

With **him**. \nHe did make everything worse for the Uchiha tho, to the point that no one in the Leaf would have ever suspected of them during the Nine Tails incident if Madara hadn't repeatedly attacked the village with Kurama.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> Which can be seen when he tells Hashirama that he knows Tobirama will be the second Hokage, and how the villagers, despite Madara being just as integral to the founding of the village, are scared of him.\n\n\nMadara is again making his prophecies become true... Hashirama tells him that he will personally advocate for Madara and the latter refuses, leaves the village and attack it, repeatedly, Tobirama ofc runs against no one and gets the position... And it's supposed to be the ultimate \"see they were out to get us\" moment.\n\n\nPeople didn't start distrusting Madara, and when I say people I too am talking about the Uchiha clan, till Madara started with his separatist talks. \n\nTime after time, Madara says that the worst scenario is going to happen and then goes out his way to make everything in his hand for that scenario to occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>And then, just as he said would happen, Tobirama becomes Hokage and goes and segregates the village\n\nThat's not what happens.\n\n\n\n\n\n>Putting place a secret state-sanctioned monitoring system to watch the Uchiha. \n\nWell duh, there's this thing called the Uchiha curse of hatred.\nEven Obito acknowledged that fact. Not keeping an eye on the Uchiha is downright irresponsible. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n>And as the years pass, and as villages modernized and grew into more formal states, the darker underbellies of govt started to emerge as we see in the Foundation where all types of evil shit happens. And none of this actually stops wars as was the point in Villages in the first place. Villages still distrust each other and go to war with each other. Only this time it isn't small clans, but larger, formal militaries with different powerful clans working together to kill each other.. Madara may have not know exactly how it would play out, but he really was right about the Villages not being enough. \n\nLol and who was the one who actually did everything in his hand to **destroy** any type of trust between the villages, allowing the distrust to fester lol.\nDo I need to remind you that Madara, while still affiliated to the Leaf, entered on a conflict of aggression against the Stone, badly hurting the 2nd Tsuchikage??\n\nAre we forgetting that Madara's response to \"dude wtf are you violating the peace accords Hashirama signed and promised\" was **there's no peace accord, there's no alliance YOU WILL BOW TO THE POWER OF THE LEAF**.\nAre we forgetting that that's a lesson that both Mu and Onoki always carried and influenced their decision making for 60 plus years till the War Arc??\n\nMadara is nothing more than an arsonist firefighter. An expert only on shitting on the bed to complain about its smell.\n\n\n\n\n>Yes initially, but then as I just laid out, he realized Villages weren't going to be enough. His main objective was to attain peace. \n\nNope, he realized that he would never be in power and got salty and then got duped by Black Zetsu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Yes, I agree. No where did I say he wasn't power hungry. But being power hungry in itself is not a bad thing. Power is a morally neutral thing. The pursuit of power is also morally neutral. The ideology, the goal, or what someone or something wants to DO with power is what can be judged in moralistic terms. \n\nWe're going with the moral relativism now huh...\nBeing power hungry is a bad thing. It means that you trample everything and anyone in your pursue for **dominance**. Sounds like our man. \nBeing power hungry has never being morally neutral. Power hungry is a very negative trait by itself.\nCan you tell me ten power hungry people in history that you can paint as good guys?\nCan you tell me a single good thing Madara did in his crazy pursuit for power?\n\n\n\n\n\n>No, actually it's quite rational.\n\nNo, it's delusional af. There are several reasons why it's delusional but the more obvious of them all is that his peace ended up being the ultimate con.\nSo, only for that it's pure delusion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>You CANNOT look at the Shinobi world- which is BY DEFINITION ruled by deceit, killing, betrayal, and quite honestly eugenics, and tell me that the idea that maybe shinobi don't actually know what is in their best interest is wrong.\n\nNo, but a I can look at *MADARA* who is **BY  DEFINITION**, murderous, deceitful, traitorous and quite honestly fond of eugenics, \"weak people disgust me\" and all that, and tell you that this fucker doesn't know what's best for himself let alone for the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n>A world that makes the Foundation a rational institution is fundamentally morally bad. Look at what was done (by state-sanctioned action mind you) to Itachi, the Uchiha, Kisame, Zabuza, Rin, Bee (and all of the Jinchuriki)- and tell me That world is a rational world where the shinobi that fight and defend the existence of such a world have an understanding of peace. \n\nNo ever said it's a good world. \nMy point is, Madara had a hand in starting that world. Madara had a hand in most of this affairs, he and Tobi quite literally controlled Kirigakure and Madara got enough pull in Kirigakure to orchestrate Rin's kidnapping and death to finish his brainwashing on Obito.\n\nMy point other point is that any solution Madara offers, based on his faulty record is suspicious at best, a worst deal than we had at worst.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>But that isn't my point. My point is that his larger goal, whether you think it makes sense or not, is quite rational and justified when you look at the context of his existence. \n\n\nIt's neither rational nor it's justified.\nBut it does make sense. Madara was always an arrogant fella, it's completely logical that he read a stone that promised him that he could be ninja Jesus and jumped on the opportunity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>You may think that individual free will trumps the betterment of the world at large\n\nWhat betterment of the world? \n\n\n\n\n\n>but you CANNOT simply look at Madara and say, \"he's a dumb despot that just wants power\".\n\nWhy yes I can.\nBut he's not only a dumb despot that just wants power. He's a dumb, megalomaniac, delusional despot that just wants his way and refuses to even consider for a moment that he might be wrong. \nThat's why he was so easy to manipulate.",

So in that context, believing an ancient tablet makes a lot of fucking sense.\n\n\\>Blaming Madara for the failure of the Village system because he fucked around too much\n\nAgain, Im not saying Madara didn't do bad things, including sowing distrust amongst the villages, but if you think that HE'S the reason it didn't work, then idk if you're just incapable of larger critiques of structures in general, if you just refuse to, or if you are just are naive. The entire universe is based on the Sengoku Jidai, and Shinobi clans in service to feudal lords. In-universe, the legitimacy of the bigger villages is entirely based on having support from a feudal lord and protecting said feudal lord. Aside from the conflicts between rival villages rooted in rivalries between clans, there is also underlying conflicts in the Feudal Lords ever sought war between nations. Such a world would be in constant chaos without Madara or the Akatsuki. Just like the Sengoku period. So did Madara do a lot to sow divisions? Maybe. But you are naive if you think that would have made a larger difference. Hell, even at the first Kage summit, they were all in distrust and threatened the Sand Village with war for making a reasonable demand. No attempt to compromise, just \"we'll gang up on you\" until Hashirama had to cry to get them to at least talk to each other. \n\nYou say that Madara had a hand in creating that world, but he didn't. The machinations of such a world were already in existence way before Madara or Hashirama made the first Village. Madara may have taken some extreme steps, but war between Villages over Village politics or because of Feudal Lord demands are inevitable because of the very nature of the universe.\n\n\\>Disturst between the Uchiha and the larger village\n\nReally? Do you really think that the Uchiha would not have been persecuted had it not been for Madara? The ruling clan of the Village were the rival clan of the Uchiha, and they only formed a peace treaty because they had a Great Man of History in Hashirama. Tobirama disliked the Uchiha as a clan, talking in slurs at them, even after his death when he saw Sasuke. Sure he had \"one of the good ones\" in his one Uchiha friend, but that doesn't negate his larger distrust of the Uchiha. And when even an evil but analytical motherfucker like Orochimaru can say, \"your policies caused the uprising\", you know there's something to it. \n\nAlso, I understand that members of the Uchiha also distrusted Madara, but so what? People of any group aren't a monolith. Even if a majority of people from a certain group believe something that doesn't mean they speak for that group, or that they even represent that group. \n\n\\>the Uchiha \"Curse of Hatred\"\n\nReally? If you're going to cite this as justification for their segregation and constant surveillance, then I'm not gonna bother with this debate after this. Even Tobirama, the Bull Connor of the Leaf Village, said they had this wrong. The Uchiha are most inclined to love. Literally what Hashirama and the racist- I mean Tobirama said. And just because Obito said it was right...so what?\n\n\\>Philosophy 301\n\nYou used the term \"moral relativism\", and assuming you really do have an understanding of that term, then I'm going to assume you have some real familiarity with philosophy. And if you do, then you know that in order for something to actually be a Universal, then it, by definition, must be provable in all cases. All. Every. It doesn't have to be disproven in 10, 100, 1,000 etc cases, only ONE. This is Philosophy 300 level stuff. So I'm simply going to say, \"Alfonso the Wise\" of Castille. There are others, but he's the least controversial, safest bet, and the one I'm most familiar with since I wrote my graduating paper on him and his political goals for my BA in History. \n\n\\>What betterment of the world?\n\nDo you really not think people living in a dream world where, as far they know, they get everything they want, never have to worry about conflict (unless they want it, in which case it only happens in their mind and nobody actually dies), and the real world is left to nature is not an objectively good thing?

That's your problem, you assume what I don't say.\nI didn't say that the village system didn't have massive problems from the get go or that it would fail eventually.\nI'm arguing that Madara never gave the system a chance once he became convinced he wouldn't be the one on top. I'm telling you that Madara did absolutely everything in his hand to sow distrust and resentment.\nThat Madara became such a threat for **everyone** that even a century after his death, the mere thought that he was behind the Akatsuki sent every big nation in a frenzy and moved them to war.\nIt is a fact that Madara try to fullfil his own prophecy. So it's obvious that he shouldn't get bragging rights when it becomes true.\n\nYou're right that in the first Kage summit, things were starting to get heated. But Hashirama pleaded with them and they relented, they actually did try to give peace a chance. The one who backstabbed that peace was Madara, he was the one who went around bullying other nations. And wether you want to admit it or not, we know that his encounter with Onoki shattered the latter and changed his worldview entirely... This man would rule Iwakagure for sixty plus years.\n\nHow can his blabbering of peace fit with his warmongering and imperialistic attitudes?? It can't.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>You say that Madara had a hand in creating that world, but he didn't. The machinations of such a world were already in existence way before Madara or Hashirama made the first Village. Madara may have taken some extreme steps, but war between Villages over Village politics or because of Feudal Lord demands are inevitable because of the very nature of the universe.\n\nOh he very much did, this is a fact. It's likely that Peace wouldn't have lasted forever?? Sure, no peace is eternal.\nIt's a fact that there was peace and Madara went screwing things up as per usual. \nMadara and Hashirama changed and shaped the world when they created the village system. \nWe have people struggling to achieve peace and then we have Madara the imperialist warmonger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Really? Do you really think that the Uchiha would not have been persecuted had it not been for Madara?\n\nYes. The very reason Tobirama was wary of them was because he knew another Madara could rise among them.\nThe very reason why decades later the higher ups move against them is because they are convinced that an Uchiha had attacked the Leaf with Kurama, in trust **Madara's disciple had done so, knowing he would frame his clan**. The only reason they have this suspicion is because Madara did in the past. \n\n\n\n>The ruling clan of the Village were the rival clan of the Uchiha, and they only formed a peace treaty because they had a Great Man of History in Hashirama\n\nThat's the thing... **They were not the ruling clan**.\nOne of their own became Hokage, that's very different from the whole clan ruling.\n\nTobirama was also in favour for peace, even since he was child. He went on record insulting the adults, both Uchiha and Senju, and arguing that if they really wanted peace, they should forget the bad blood, sign accords and stick to them.\n\n\n\n>Tobirama disliked the Uchiha as a clan, talking in slurs at them, even after his death when he saw Sasuke. \n\nNo such thing happened.\nHe said that he wasn't surprised that an Uchiha associated himself with scoundrel like Orochimaru.\n\n\n\n\n\n>Sure he had \"one of the good ones\" in his one Uchiha friend, but that doesn't negate his larger distrust of the Uchiha.\n\nHe never denies that one. \nHe also explains why he was wary of them. It's obvious that any clan cursed with being genetically predisposed to go mad and the crazier the got the more op they became was a motive for worrying.\nSeems funny that you were talking big about realpolitik a paragraph ago but went full Hashirama here.\n\n\n\n\n>And when even an evil but analytical motherfucker like Orochimaru can say, \"your policies caused the uprising\", you know there's something to it. \n\nNothing Orochimaru said made any sense. \nThis is highlighted with the fact that the Uchiha actually loved their position as Military Police.\nOrochi also act like people naturally distrust officers and it isn't their actions what turn people on them.\nPeople also forget that Orochi also said that  the Uchiha became super arrogant due their power and position... \n\nWe can discuss this in full but no, his policies had nothing to do with it. \n\n\n\n>Also, I understand that members of the Uchiha also distrusted Madara, but so what? People of any group aren't a monolith. Even if a majority of people from a certain group believe something that doesn't mean they speak for that group, or that they even represent that group. \n\n\n- If the majority of a group doesn't represent that group... Who does?\n\n- Madara said that not a single member of his clan supported him in his uprising and they all turned their backs on him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Even Tobirama, the Bull Connor of the Leaf Village, said they had this wrong. The Uchiha are most inclined to love\n\nHe never said that this was wrong lol.\nHe said that it's wrong the saying that *the Senju love more intensely than the Uchiha*.\n\nHe said that the Uchiha love more but that once they lose the thing they love they start losing it little by little and the physical manifestation of that is the Sharingan.\nThe more the lose it, the more strong they get.\n\n\n\n\n\n>Literally what Hashirama and the racist- I mean Tobirama said. And just because Obito said it was right...so what?\n\nWow, we have abandoned any perception of neutrality. We just went full racist Tobirama meme.\n\nYou don't have to believe it just because Obito supports it, it's simply a curiosity, there's enough evidence for it enough. Starting for the fact that both Black Zetsu and Indra forced the wrong path onto the Uchiha.\nThis is the same clan that used to kill each other for their eyes and all that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>So I'm simply going to say, \"Alfonso the Wise\" of Castille. There are others, but he's the least controversial, safest bet, and the one I'm most familiar with since I wrote my graduating paper on him and his political goals for my BA in History. \n\n\nI did ask you for ten. You only give me one.\nThe one you think it's the most morally good. Which is someone that forced ethnic cleansing on his lands...  If they are controversial then you know already that they are not morally good lol.\nYou either are confusing morally with great ruler or you simply felt the need to answer.\n\n\n\nI ask you again, what morally good choice did Madara ever do in his quest for power?\n\n\n\n>Do you really not think people living in a dream world where, as far they know, they get everything they want, never have to worry about conflict (unless they want it, in which case it only happens in their mind and nobody actually dies), and the real world is left to nature is not an objectively good thing? By all manners that we quantify \"goodness\", that hits the mark.\n\nLol no, I think that a world of sleeping slaves that are forced to be drugged forever without having any experience whatsoever except that of their dreams.\nNo, dreaming forever is not good. It's hell for me.\nIf you believe that living your life in a comatose sleep is the ultimate goal, by all means do that. Just don't **force it** on the rest of us. That's something Madara ever understood either, diplomacy and free will.",

There is going to be a lot of insight into the First Shinobi World War, and not just through flashbacks and exposition but possibly through an entire Arc similar to the way Kakashi's backstory was flushed out. Going even further back, there will also be more detail given to the warring states period, because I feel like the dynamics of the different Clans in that era are fuzzy at best.",

So even if you argue that 1st tomoe was because Itachi tortured him the rest of its development was because of his positive attachments. Clearly torturing him was not the best way to develop the eyes, Itachi admits as much before he gets released from Edo Tensei.",

He could have at least left the fucking children that posed absolutely no threat to anyone alive.

His main objective was to attain peace. \n\n>being power hungry\n\n\nYes, I agree. No where did I say he wasn't power hungry. But being power hungry in itself is not a bad thing. Power is a morally neutral thing. The pursuit of power is also morally neutral. The ideology, the goal, or what someone or something wants to DO with power is what can be judged in moralistic terms. \n\n>he's delusional\n\n\nNo, actually it's quite rational. You CANNOT look at the Shinobi world- which is BY DEFINITION ruled by deceit, killing, betrayal, and quite honestly eugenics, and tell me that the idea that maybe shinobi don't actually know what  is in their best interest is wrong. Any peace treaty is only momentary and can be broken at literally any moment. A world that makes the Foundation a rational institution is fundamentally morally bad. Look at what was done (by state-sanctioned action mind you) to Itachi, the Uchiha, Kisame, Zabuza, Rin, Bee (and all of the Jinchuriki)- and tell me That world is a rational world where the shinobi that fight and defend the existence of such a world have an understanding of peace. \n\nUndermining the village, trying to kill Hashirama to take his power, sacrificing the Jinchuriki to fulfill his plan, throwing the world into destruction before it can become peaceful- I don't deny any of that. But that isn't my point. My point is that his larger goal, whether you think it makes sense or not, is quite rational and justified when you look at the context of his existence. You may think that individual free will trumps the betterment of the world at large, or that his pursuit of power led to morally bad things, and I'm not even trying to debate that with you, but you CANNOT simply look at Madara and say, \"he's a dumb despot that just wants power\".",

His main objective was to attain peace. \n\nNope, he realized that he would never be in power and got salty and then got duped by Black Zetsu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Yes, I agree. No where did I say he wasn't power hungry. But being power hungry in itself is not a bad thing. Power is a morally neutral thing. The pursuit of power is also morally neutral. The ideology, the goal, or what someone or something wants to DO with power is what can be judged in moralistic terms. \n\nWe're going with the moral relativism now huh...\nBeing power hungry is a bad thing. It means that you trample everything and anyone in your pursue for **dominance**. Sounds like our man. \nBeing power hungry has never being morally neutral. Power hungry is a very negative trait by itself.\nCan you tell me ten power hungry people in history that you can paint as good guys?\nCan you tell me a single good thing Madara did in his crazy pursuit for power?\n\n\n\n\n\n>No, actually it's quite rational.\n\nNo, it's delusional af. There are several reasons why it's delusional but the more obvious of them all is that his peace ended up being the ultimate con.\nSo, only for that it's pure delusion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>You CANNOT look at the Shinobi world- which is BY DEFINITION ruled by deceit, killing, betrayal, and quite honestly eugenics, and tell me that the idea that maybe shinobi don't actually know what is in their best interest is wrong.\n\nNo, but a I can look at *MADARA* who is **BY  DEFINITION**, murderous, deceitful, traitorous and quite honestly fond of eugenics, \"weak people disgust me\" and all that, and tell you that this fucker doesn't know what's best for himself let alone for the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n>A world that makes the Foundation a rational institution is fundamentally morally bad. Look at what was done (by state-sanctioned action mind you) to Itachi, the Uchiha, Kisame, Zabuza, Rin, Bee (and all of the Jinchuriki)- and tell me That world is a rational world where the shinobi that fight and defend the existence of such a world have an understanding of peace. \n\nNo ever said it's a good world. \nMy point is, Madara had a hand in starting that world. Madara had a hand in most of this affairs, he and Tobi quite literally controlled Kirigakure and Madara got enough pull in Kirigakure to orchestrate Rin's kidnapping and death to finish his brainwashing on Obito.\n\nMy point other point is that any solution Madara offers, based on his faulty record is suspicious at best, a worst deal than we had at worst.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>But that isn't my point. My point is that his larger goal, whether you think it makes sense or not, is quite rational and justified when you look at the context of his existence. \n\n\nIt's neither rational nor it's justified.\nBut it does make sense. Madara was always an arrogant fella, it's completely logical that he read a stone that promised him that he could be ninja Jesus and jumped on the opportunity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>You may think that individual free will trumps the betterment of the world at large\n\nWhat betterment of the world? \n\n\n\n\n\n>but you CANNOT simply look at Madara and say, \"he's a dumb despot that just wants power\".\n\nWhy yes I can.\nBut he's not only a dumb despot that just wants power. He's a dumb, megalomaniac, delusional despot that just wants his way and refuses to even consider for a moment that he might be wrong. \nThat's why he was so easy to manipulate.",

I did not mean when Hashirama first proposes the Village system, or even when their village starts to take off, I mean when the village starts to take form, it was still in it's feudal stages, and then after he reads the Uchiha tablet.\n\n And before you oversimplify the tablet reading, keep in mind this is a universe where there are ancient all-powerful magic beasts, ancient super-moves are written on ancient scrolls, the Sage of the 6thfold Path is literally incarnated, Princess Kaguya is a demon monster, and the Shinto Pantheon are materialized in super techniques. So in that context, believing an ancient tablet makes a lot of fucking sense.\n\n\\>Blaming Madara for the failure of the Village system because he fucked around too much\n\nAgain, Im not saying Madara didn't do bad things, including sowing distrust amongst the villages, but if you think that HE'S the reason it didn't work, then idk if you're just incapable of larger critiques of structures in general, if you just refuse to, or if you are just are naive. The entire universe is based on the Sengoku Jidai, and Shinobi clans in service to feudal lords. In-universe, the legitimacy of the bigger villages is entirely based on having support from a feudal lord and protecting said feudal lord. Aside from the conflicts between rival villages rooted in rivalries between clans, there is also underlying conflicts in the Feudal Lords ever sought war between nations. Such a world would be in constant chaos without Madara or the Akatsuki. Just like the Sengoku period. So did Madara do a lot to sow divisions? Maybe. But you are naive if you think that would have made a larger difference. Hell, even at the first Kage summit, they were all in distrust and threatened the Sand Village with war for making a reasonable demand. No attempt to compromise, just \"we'll gang up on you\" until Hashirama had to cry to get them to at least talk to each other. \n\nYou say that Madara had a hand in creating that world, but he didn't. The machinations of such a world were already in existence way before Madara or Hashirama made the first Village. Madara may have taken some extreme steps, but war between Villages over Village politics or because of Feudal Lord demands are inevitable because of the very nature of the universe.\n\n\\>Disturst between the Uchiha and the larger village\n\nReally? Do you really think that the Uchiha would not have been persecuted had it not been for Madara? The ruling clan of the Village were the rival clan of the Uchiha, and they only formed a peace treaty because they had a Great Man of History in Hashirama. Tobirama disliked the Uchiha as a clan, talking in slurs at them, even after his death when he saw Sasuke. Sure he had \"one of the good ones\" in his one Uchiha friend, but that doesn't negate his larger distrust of the Uchiha. And when even an evil but analytical motherfucker like Orochimaru can say, \"your policies caused the uprising\", you know there's something to it. \n\nAlso, I understand that members of the Uchiha also distrusted Madara, but so what? People of any group aren't a monolith. Even if a majority of people from a certain group believe something that doesn't mean they speak for that group, or that they even represent that group. \n\n\\>the Uchiha \"Curse of Hatred\"\n\nReally? If you're going to cite this as justification for their segregation and constant surveillance, then I'm not gonna bother with this debate after this. Even Tobirama, the Bull Connor of the Leaf Village, said they had this wrong. The Uchiha are most inclined to love. Literally what Hashirama and the racist- I mean Tobirama said. And just because Obito said it was right...so what?\n\n\\>Philosophy 301\n\nYou used the term \"moral relativism\", and assuming you really do have an understanding of that term, then I'm going to assume you have some real familiarity with philosophy. And if you do, then you know that in order for something to actually be a Universal, then it, by definition, must be provable in all cases. All. Every. It doesn't have to be disproven in 10, 100, 1,000 etc cases, only ONE. This is Philosophy 300 level stuff. So I'm simply going to say, \"Alfonso the Wise\" of Castille. There are others, but he's the least controversial, safest bet, and the one I'm most familiar with since I wrote my graduating paper on him and his political goals for my BA in History. \n\n\\>What betterment of the world?\n\nDo you really not think people living in a dream world where, as far they know, they get everything they want, never have to worry about conflict (unless they want it, in which case it only happens in their mind and nobody actually dies), and the real world is left to nature is not an objectively good thing?

That's your problem, you assume what I don't say.\nI didn't say that the village system didn't have massive problems from the get go or that it would fail eventually.\nI'm arguing that Madara never gave the system a chance once he became convinced he wouldn't be the one on top. I'm telling you that Madara did absolutely everything in his hand to sow distrust and resentment.\nThat Madara became such a threat for **everyone** that even a century after his death, the mere thought that he was behind the Akatsuki sent every big nation in a frenzy and moved them to war.\nIt is a fact that Madara try to fullfil his own prophecy. So it's obvious that he shouldn't get bragging rights when it becomes true.\n\nYou're right that in the first Kage summit, things were starting to get heated. But Hashirama pleaded with them and they relented, they actually did try to give peace a chance. The one who backstabbed that peace was Madara, he was the one who went around bullying other nations. And wether you want to admit it or not, we know that his encounter with Onoki shattered the latter and changed his worldview entirely... This man would rule Iwakagure for sixty plus years.\n\nHow can his blabbering of peace fit with his warmongering and imperialistic attitudes?? It can't.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>You say that Madara had a hand in creating that world, but he didn't. The machinations of such a world were already in existence way before Madara or Hashirama made the first Village. Madara may have taken some extreme steps, but war between Villages over Village politics or because of Feudal Lord demands are inevitable because of the very nature of the universe.\n\nOh he very much did, this is a fact. It's likely that Peace wouldn't have lasted forever?? Sure, no peace is eternal.\nIt's a fact that there was peace and Madara went screwing things up as per usual. \nMadara and Hashirama changed and shaped the world when they created the village system. \nWe have people struggling to achieve peace and then we have Madara the imperialist warmonger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Really? Do you really think that the Uchiha would not have been persecuted had it not been for Madara?\n\nYes. The very reason Tobirama was wary of them was because he knew another Madara could rise among them.\nThe very reason why decades later the higher ups move against them is because they are convinced that an Uchiha had attacked the Leaf with Kurama, in trust **Madara's disciple had done so, knowing he would frame his clan**. The only reason they have this suspicion is because Madara did in the past. \n\n\n\n>The ruling clan of the Village were the rival clan of the Uchiha, and they only formed a peace treaty because they had a Great Man of History in Hashirama\n\nThat's the thing... **They were not the ruling clan**.\nOne of their own became Hokage, that's very different from the whole clan ruling.\n\nTobirama was also in favour for peace, even since he was child. He went on record insulting the adults, both Uchiha and Senju, and arguing that if they really wanted peace, they should forget the bad blood, sign accords and stick to them.\n\n\n\n>Tobirama disliked the Uchiha as a clan, talking in slurs at them, even after his death when he saw Sasuke. \n\nNo such thing happened.\nHe said that he wasn't surprised that an Uchiha associated himself with scoundrel like Orochimaru.\n\n\n\n\n\n>Sure he had \"one of the good ones\" in his one Uchiha friend, but that doesn't negate his larger distrust of the Uchiha.\n\nHe never denies that one. \nHe also explains why he was wary of them. It's obvious that any clan cursed with being genetically predisposed to go mad and the crazier the got the more op they became was a motive for worrying.\nSeems funny that you were talking big about realpolitik a paragraph ago but went full Hashirama here.\n\n\n\n\n>And when even an evil but analytical motherfucker like Orochimaru can say, \"your policies caused the uprising\", you know there's something to it. \n\nNothing Orochimaru said made any sense. \nThis is highlighted with the fact that the Uchiha actually loved their position as Military Police.\nOrochi also act like people naturally distrust officers and it isn't their actions what turn people on them.\nPeople also forget that Orochi also said that  the Uchiha became super arrogant due their power and position... \n\nWe can discuss this in full but no, his policies had nothing to do with it. \n\n\n\n>Also, I understand that members of the Uchiha also distrusted Madara, but so what? People of any group aren't a monolith. Even if a majority of people from a certain group believe something that doesn't mean they speak for that group, or that they even represent that group. \n\n\n- If the majority of a group doesn't represent that group... Who does?\n\n- Madara said that not a single member of his clan supported him in his uprising and they all turned their backs on him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Even Tobirama, the Bull Connor of the Leaf Village, said they had this wrong. The Uchiha are most inclined to love\n\nHe never said that this was wrong lol.\nHe said that it's wrong the saying that *the Senju love more intensely than the Uchiha*.\n\nHe said that the Uchiha love more but that once they lose the thing they love they start losing it little by little and the physical manifestation of that is the Sharingan.\nThe more the lose it, the more strong they get.\n\n\n\n\n\n>Literally what Hashirama and the racist- I mean Tobirama said. And just because Obito said it was right...so what?\n\nWow, we have abandoned any perception of neutrality. We just went full racist Tobirama meme.\n\nYou don't have to believe it just because Obito supports it, it's simply a curiosity, there's enough evidence for it enough. Starting for the fact that both Black Zetsu and Indra forced the wrong path onto the Uchiha.\nThis is the same clan that used to kill each other for their eyes and all that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>So I'm simply going to say, \"Alfonso the Wise\" of Castille. There are others, but he's the least controversial, safest bet, and the one I'm most familiar with since I wrote my graduating paper on him and his political goals for my BA in History. \n\n\nI did ask you for ten. You only give me one.\nThe one you think it's the most morally good. Which is someone that forced ethnic cleansing on his lands...  If they are controversial then you know already that they are not morally good lol.\nYou either are confusing morally with great ruler or you simply felt the need to answer.\n\n\n\nI ask you again, what morally good choice did Madara ever do in his quest for power?\n\n\n\n>Do you really not think people living in a dream world where, as far they know, they get everything they want, never have to worry about conflict (unless they want it, in which case it only happens in their mind and nobody actually dies), and the real world is left to nature is not an objectively good thing? By all manners that we quantify \"goodness\", that hits the mark.\n\nLol no, I think that a world of sleeping slaves that are forced to be drugged forever without having any experience whatsoever except that of their dreams.\nNo, dreaming forever is not good. It's hell for me.\nIf you believe that living your life in a comatose sleep is the ultimate goal, by all means do that. Just don't **force it** on the rest of us. That's something Madara ever understood either, diplomacy and free will.",

So even if you argue that 1st tomoe was because Itachi tortured him the rest of its development was because of his positive attachments. Clearly torturing him was not the best way to develop the eyes, Itachi admits as much before he gets released from Edo Tensei.",

His main objective was to attain peace. \n\n>being power hungry\n\n\nYes, I agree. No where did I say he wasn't power hungry. But being power hungry in itself is not a bad thing. Power is a morally neutral thing. The pursuit of power is also morally neutral. The ideology, the goal, or what someone or something wants to DO with power is what can be judged in moralistic terms. \n\n>he's delusional\n\n\nNo, actually it's quite rational. You CANNOT look at the Shinobi world- which is BY DEFINITION ruled by deceit, killing, betrayal, and quite honestly eugenics, and tell me that the idea that maybe shinobi don't actually know what  is in their best interest is wrong. Any peace treaty is only momentary and can be broken at literally any moment. A world that makes the Foundation a rational institution is fundamentally morally bad. Look at what was done (by state-sanctioned action mind you) to Itachi, the Uchiha, Kisame, Zabuza, Rin, Bee (and all of the Jinchuriki)- and tell me That world is a rational world where the shinobi that fight and defend the existence of such a world have an understanding of peace. \n\nUndermining the village, trying to kill Hashirama to take his power, sacrificing the Jinchuriki to fulfill his plan, throwing the world into destruction before it can become peaceful- I don't deny any of that. But that isn't my point. My point is that his larger goal, whether you think it makes sense or not, is quite rational and justified when you look at the context of his existence. You may think that individual free will trumps the betterment of the world at large, or that his pursuit of power led to morally bad things, and I'm not even trying to debate that with you, but you CANNOT simply look at Madara and say, \"he's a dumb despot that just wants power\".",

Look at what was done (by state-sanctioned action mind you) to Itachi, the Uchiha, Kisame, Zabuza, Rin, Bee (and all of the Jinchuriki)- and tell me That world is a rational world where the shinobi that fight and defend the existence of such a world have an understanding of peace. \n\nNo ever said it's a good world. \nMy point is, Madara had a hand in starting that world. Madara had a hand in most of this affairs, he and Tobi quite literally controlled Kirigakure and Madara got enough pull in Kirigakure to orchestrate Rin's kidnapping and death to finish his brainwashing on Obito.\n\nMy point other point is that any solution Madara offers, based on his faulty record is suspicious at best, a worst deal than we had at worst.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>But that isn't my point. My point is that his larger goal, whether you think it makes sense or not, is quite rational and justified when you look at the context of his existence. \n\n\nIt's neither rational nor it's justified.\nBut it does make sense. Madara was always an arrogant fella, it's completely logical that he read a stone that promised him that he could be ninja Jesus and jumped on the opportunity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>You may think that individual free will trumps the betterment of the world at large\n\nWhat betterment of the world? \n\n\n\n\n\n>but you CANNOT simply look at Madara and say, \"he's a dumb despot that just wants power\".\n\nWhy yes I can.\nBut he's not only a dumb despot that just wants power. He's a dumb, megalomaniac, delusional despot that just wants his way and refuses to even consider for a moment that he might be wrong. \nThat's why he was so easy to manipulate.",

So in that context, believing an ancient tablet makes a lot of fucking sense.\n\n\\>Blaming Madara for the failure of the Village system because he fucked around too much\n\nAgain, Im not saying Madara didn't do bad things, including sowing distrust amongst the villages, but if you think that HE'S the reason it didn't work, then idk if you're just incapable of larger critiques of structures in general, if you just refuse to, or if you are just are naive. The entire universe is based on the Sengoku Jidai, and Shinobi clans in service to feudal lords. In-universe, the legitimacy of the bigger villages is entirely based on having support from a feudal lord and protecting said feudal lord. Aside from the conflicts between rival villages rooted in rivalries between clans, there is also underlying conflicts in the Feudal Lords ever sought war between nations. Such a world would be in constant chaos without Madara or the Akatsuki. Just like the Sengoku period. So did Madara do a lot to sow divisions? Maybe. But you are naive if you think that would have made a larger difference. Hell, even at the first Kage summit, they were all in distrust and threatened the Sand Village with war for making a reasonable demand. No attempt to compromise, just \"we'll gang up on you\" until Hashirama had to cry to get them to at least talk to each other. \n\nYou say that Madara had a hand in creating that world, but he didn't. The machinations of such a world were already in existence way before Madara or Hashirama made the first Village. Madara may have taken some extreme steps, but war between Villages over Village politics or because of Feudal Lord demands are inevitable because of the very nature of the universe.\n\n\\>Disturst between the Uchiha and the larger village\n\nReally? Do you really think that the Uchiha would not have been persecuted had it not been for Madara? The ruling clan of the Village were the rival clan of the Uchiha, and they only formed a peace treaty because they had a Great Man of History in Hashirama. Tobirama disliked the Uchiha as a clan, talking in slurs at them, even after his death when he saw Sasuke. Sure he had \"one of the good ones\" in his one Uchiha friend, but that doesn't negate his larger distrust of the Uchiha. And when even an evil but analytical motherfucker like Orochimaru can say, \"your policies caused the uprising\", you know there's something to it. \n\nAlso, I understand that members of the Uchiha also distrusted Madara, but so what? People of any group aren't a monolith. Even if a majority of people from a certain group believe something that doesn't mean they speak for that group, or that they even represent that group. \n\n\\>the Uchiha \"Curse of Hatred\"\n\nReally? If you're going to cite this as justification for their segregation and constant surveillance, then I'm not gonna bother with this debate after this. Even Tobirama, the Bull Connor of the Leaf Village, said they had this wrong. The Uchiha are most inclined to love. Literally what Hashirama and the racist- I mean Tobirama said. And just because Obito said it was right...so what?\n\n\\>Philosophy 301\n\nYou used the term \"moral relativism\", and assuming you really do have an understanding of that term, then I'm going to assume you have some real familiarity with philosophy. And if you do, then you know that in order for something to actually be a Universal, then it, by definition, must be provable in all cases. All. Every. It doesn't have to be disproven in 10, 100, 1,000 etc cases, only ONE. This is Philosophy 300 level stuff. So I'm simply going to say, \"Alfonso the Wise\" of Castille. There are others, but he's the least controversial, safest bet, and the one I'm most familiar with since I wrote my graduating paper on him and his political goals for my BA in History. \n\n\\>What betterment of the world?\n\nDo you really not think people living in a dream world where, as far they know, they get everything they want, never have to worry about conflict (unless they want it, in which case it only happens in their mind and nobody actually dies), and the real world is left to nature is not an objectively good thing?

That's your problem, you assume what I don't say.\nI didn't say that the village system didn't have massive problems from the get go or that it would fail eventually.\nI'm arguing that Madara never gave the system a chance once he became convinced he wouldn't be the one on top. I'm telling you that Madara did absolutely everything in his hand to sow distrust and resentment.\nThat Madara became such a threat for **everyone** that even a century after his death, the mere thought that he was behind the Akatsuki sent every big nation in a frenzy and moved them to war.\nIt is a fact that Madara try to fullfil his own prophecy. So it's obvious that he shouldn't get bragging rights when it becomes true.\n\nYou're right that in the first Kage summit, things were starting to get heated. But Hashirama pleaded with them and they relented, they actually did try to give peace a chance. The one who backstabbed that peace was Madara, he was the one who went around bullying other nations. And wether you want to admit it or not, we know that his encounter with Onoki shattered the latter and changed his worldview entirely... This man would rule Iwakagure for sixty plus years.\n\nHow can his blabbering of peace fit with his warmongering and imperialistic attitudes?? It can't.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>You say that Madara had a hand in creating that world, but he didn't. The machinations of such a world were already in existence way before Madara or Hashirama made the first Village. Madara may have taken some extreme steps, but war between Villages over Village politics or because of Feudal Lord demands are inevitable because of the very nature of the universe.\n\nOh he very much did, this is a fact. It's likely that Peace wouldn't have lasted forever?? Sure, no peace is eternal.\nIt's a fact that there was peace and Madara went screwing things up as per usual. \nMadara and Hashirama changed and shaped the world when they created the village system. \nWe have people struggling to achieve peace and then we have Madara the imperialist warmonger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Really? Do you really think that the Uchiha would not have been persecuted had it not been for Madara?\n\nYes. The very reason Tobirama was wary of them was because he knew another Madara could rise among them.\nThe very reason why decades later the higher ups move against them is because they are convinced that an Uchiha had attacked the Leaf with Kurama, in trust **Madara's disciple had done so, knowing he would frame his clan**. The only reason they have this suspicion is because Madara did in the past. \n\n\n\n>The ruling clan of the Village were the rival clan of the Uchiha, and they only formed a peace treaty because they had a Great Man of History in Hashirama\n\nThat's the thing... **They were not the ruling clan**.\nOne of their own became Hokage, that's very different from the whole clan ruling.\n\nTobirama was also in favour for peace, even since he was child. He went on record insulting the adults, both Uchiha and Senju, and arguing that if they really wanted peace, they should forget the bad blood, sign accords and stick to them.\n\n\n\n>Tobirama disliked the Uchiha as a clan, talking in slurs at them, even after his death when he saw Sasuke. \n\nNo such thing happened.\nHe said that he wasn't surprised that an Uchiha associated himself with scoundrel like Orochimaru.\n\n\n\n\n\n>Sure he had \"one of the good ones\" in his one Uchiha friend, but that doesn't negate his larger distrust of the Uchiha.\n\nHe never denies that one. \nHe also explains why he was wary of them. It's obvious that any clan cursed with being genetically predisposed to go mad and the crazier the got the more op they became was a motive for worrying.\nSeems funny that you were talking big about realpolitik a paragraph ago but went full Hashirama here.\n\n\n\n\n>And when even an evil but analytical motherfucker like Orochimaru can say, \"your policies caused the uprising\", you know there's something to it. \n\nNothing Orochimaru said made any sense. \nThis is highlighted with the fact that the Uchiha actually loved their position as Military Police.\nOrochi also act like people naturally distrust officers and it isn't their actions what turn people on them.\nPeople also forget that Orochi also said that  the Uchiha became super arrogant due their power and position... \n\nWe can discuss this in full but no, his policies had nothing to do with it. \n\n\n\n>Also, I understand that members of the Uchiha also distrusted Madara, but so what? People of any group aren't a monolith. Even if a majority of people from a certain group believe something that doesn't mean they speak for that group, or that they even represent that group. \n\n\n- If the majority of a group doesn't represent that group... Who does?\n\n- Madara said that not a single member of his clan supported him in his uprising and they all turned their backs on him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Even Tobirama, the Bull Connor of the Leaf Village, said they had this wrong. The Uchiha are most inclined to love\n\nHe never said that this was wrong lol.\nHe said that it's wrong the saying that *the Senju love more intensely than the Uchiha*.\n\nHe said that the Uchiha love more but that once they lose the thing they love they start losing it little by little and the physical manifestation of that is the Sharingan.\nThe more the lose it, the more strong they get.\n\n\n\n\n\n>Literally what Hashirama and the racist- I mean Tobirama said. And just because Obito said it was right...so what?\n\nWow, we have abandoned any perception of neutrality. We just went full racist Tobirama meme.\n\nYou don't have to believe it just because Obito supports it, it's simply a curiosity, there's enough evidence for it enough. Starting for the fact that both Black Zetsu and Indra forced the wrong path onto the Uchiha.\nThis is the same clan that used to kill each other for their eyes and all that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>So I'm simply going to say, \"Alfonso the Wise\" of Castille. There are others, but he's the least controversial, safest bet, and the one I'm most familiar with since I wrote my graduating paper on him and his political goals for my BA in History. \n\n\nI did ask you for ten. You only give me one.\nThe one you think it's the most morally good. Which is someone that forced ethnic cleansing on his lands...  If they are controversial then you know already that they are not morally good lol.\nYou either are confusing morally with great ruler or you simply felt the need to answer.\n\n\n\nI ask you again, what morally good choice did Madara ever do in his quest for power?\n\n\n\n>Do you really not think people living in a dream world where, as far they know, they get everything they want, never have to worry about conflict (unless they want it, in which case it only happens in their mind and nobody actually dies), and the real world is left to nature is not an objectively good thing? By all manners that we quantify \"goodness\", that hits the mark.\n\nLol no, I think that a world of sleeping slaves that are forced to be drugged forever without having any experience whatsoever except that of their dreams.\nNo, dreaming forever is not good. It's hell for me.\nIf you believe that living your life in a comatose sleep is the ultimate goal, by all means do that. Just don't **force it** on the rest of us. That's something Madara ever understood either, diplomacy and free will.",

He was far to affected by his emotions IMO, and he repeatedly let them affect his judgement in the worst ways possible. Then you have Danzo who was the exact opposite end of that scale. The most ironic part being that they both thought they were doing the right thing, and both consistently chose the worst ways to go about it.",

He was pretty happy to run things when Hashirama told him he would be Kage.\n\nHe was more pessimistic once he didn't get the power tho.\n\n\n\n\n\n>He sees the underlying social distrust the village has of the Uchiha.\n\nNot the Uchiha... With **him**. \nHe did make everything worse for the Uchiha tho, to the point that no one in the Leaf would have ever suspected of them during the Nine Tails incident if Madara hadn't repeatedly attacked the village with Kurama.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> Which can be seen when he tells Hashirama that he knows Tobirama will be the second Hokage, and how the villagers, despite Madara being just as integral to the founding of the village, are scared of him.\n\n\nMadara is again making his prophecies become true... Hashirama tells him that he will personally advocate for Madara and the latter refuses, leaves the village and attack it, repeatedly, Tobirama ofc runs against no one and gets the position... And it's supposed to be the ultimate \"see they were out to get us\" moment.\n\n\nPeople didn't start distrusting Madara, and when I say people I too am talking about the Uchiha clan, till Madara started with his separatist talks. \n\nTime after time, Madara says that the worst scenario is going to happen and then goes out his way to make everything in his hand for that scenario to occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>And then, just as he said would happen, Tobirama becomes Hokage and goes and segregates the village\n\nThat's not what happens.\n\n\n\n\n\n>Putting place a secret state-sanctioned monitoring system to watch the Uchiha. \n\nWell duh, there's this thing called the Uchiha curse of hatred.\nEven Obito acknowledged that fact. Not keeping an eye on the Uchiha is downright irresponsible. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n>And as the years pass, and as villages modernized and grew into more formal states, the darker underbellies of govt started to emerge as we see in the Foundation where all types of evil shit happens. And none of this actually stops wars as was the point in Villages in the first place. Villages still distrust each other and go to war with each other. Only this time it isn't small clans, but larger, formal militaries with different powerful clans working together to kill each other.. Madara may have not know exactly how it would play out, but he really was right about the Villages not being enough. \n\nLol and who was the one who actually did everything in his hand to **destroy** any type of trust between the villages, allowing the distrust to fester lol.\nDo I need to remind you that Madara, while still affiliated to the Leaf, entered on a conflict of aggression against the Stone, badly hurting the 2nd Tsuchikage??\n\nAre we forgetting that Madara's response to \"dude wtf are you violating the peace accords Hashirama signed and promised\" was **there's no peace accord, there's no alliance YOU WILL BOW TO THE POWER OF THE LEAF**.\nAre we forgetting that that's a lesson that both Mu and Onoki always carried and influenced their decision making for 60 plus years till the War Arc??\n\nMadara is nothing more than an arsonist firefighter. An expert only on shitting on the bed to complain about its smell.\n\n\n\n\n>Yes initially, but then as I just laid out, he realized Villages weren't going to be enough. His main objective was to attain peace. \n\nNope, he realized that he would never be in power and got salty and then got duped by Black Zetsu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Yes, I agree. No where did I say he wasn't power hungry. But being power hungry in itself is not a bad thing. Power is a morally neutral thing. The pursuit of power is also morally neutral. The ideology, the goal, or what someone or something wants to DO with power is what can be judged in moralistic terms. \n\nWe're going with the moral relativism now huh...\nBeing power hungry is a bad thing. It means that you trample everything and anyone in your pursue for **dominance**. Sounds like our man. \nBeing power hungry has never being morally neutral. Power hungry is a very negative trait by itself.\nCan you tell me ten power hungry people in history that you can paint as good guys?\nCan you tell me a single good thing Madara did in his crazy pursuit for power?\n\n\n\n\n\n>No, actually it's quite rational.\n\nNo, it's delusional af. There are several reasons why it's delusional but the more obvious of them all is that his peace ended up being the ultimate con.\nSo, only for that it's pure delusion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>You CANNOT look at the Shinobi world- which is BY DEFINITION ruled by deceit, killing, betrayal, and quite honestly eugenics, and tell me that the idea that maybe shinobi don't actually know what is in their best interest is wrong.\n\nNo, but a I can look at *MADARA* who is **BY  DEFINITION**, murderous, deceitful, traitorous and quite honestly fond of eugenics, \"weak people disgust me\" and all that, and tell you that this fucker doesn't know what's best for himself let alone for the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n>A world that makes the Foundation a rational institution is fundamentally morally bad. Look at what was done (by state-sanctioned action mind you) to Itachi, the Uchiha, Kisame, Zabuza, Rin, Bee (and all of the Jinchuriki)- and tell me That world is a rational world where the shinobi that fight and defend the existence of such a world have an understanding of peace. \n\nNo ever said it's a good world. \nMy point is, Madara had a hand in starting that world. Madara had a hand in most of this affairs, he and Tobi quite literally controlled Kirigakure and Madara got enough pull in Kirigakure to orchestrate Rin's kidnapping and death to finish his brainwashing on Obito.\n\nMy point other point is that any solution Madara offers, based on his faulty record is suspicious at best, a worst deal than we had at worst.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>But that isn't my point. My point is that his larger goal, whether you think it makes sense or not, is quite rational and justified when you look at the context of his existence. \n\n\nIt's neither rational nor it's justified.\nBut it does make sense. Madara was always an arrogant fella, it's completely logical that he read a stone that promised him that he could be ninja Jesus and jumped on the opportunity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>You may think that individual free will trumps the betterment of the world at large\n\nWhat betterment of the world? \n\n\n\n\n\n>but you CANNOT simply look at Madara and say, \"he's a dumb despot that just wants power\".\n\nWhy yes I can.\nBut he's not only a dumb despot that just wants power. He's a dumb, megalomaniac, delusional despot that just wants his way and refuses to even consider for a moment that he might be wrong. \nThat's why he was so easy to manipulate.",

So in that context, believing an ancient tablet makes a lot of fucking sense.\n\n\\>Blaming Madara for the failure of the Village system because he fucked around too much\n\nAgain, Im not saying Madara didn't do bad things, including sowing distrust amongst the villages, but if you think that HE'S the reason it didn't work, then idk if you're just incapable of larger critiques of structures in general, if you just refuse to, or if you are just are naive. The entire universe is based on the Sengoku Jidai, and Shinobi clans in service to feudal lords. In-universe, the legitimacy of the bigger villages is entirely based on having support from a feudal lord and protecting said feudal lord. Aside from the conflicts between rival villages rooted in rivalries between clans, there is also underlying conflicts in the Feudal Lords ever sought war between nations. Such a world would be in constant chaos without Madara or the Akatsuki. Just like the Sengoku period. So did Madara do a lot to sow divisions? Maybe. But you are naive if you think that would have made a larger difference. Hell, even at the first Kage summit, they were all in distrust and threatened the Sand Village with war for making a reasonable demand. No attempt to compromise, just \"we'll gang up on you\" until Hashirama had to cry to get them to at least talk to each other. \n\nYou say that Madara had a hand in creating that world, but he didn't. The machinations of such a world were already in existence way before Madara or Hashirama made the first Village. Madara may have taken some extreme steps, but war between Villages over Village politics or because of Feudal Lord demands are inevitable because of the very nature of the universe.\n\n\\>Disturst between the Uchiha and the larger village\n\nReally? Do you really think that the Uchiha would not have been persecuted had it not been for Madara? The ruling clan of the Village were the rival clan of the Uchiha, and they only formed a peace treaty because they had a Great Man of History in Hashirama. Tobirama disliked the Uchiha as a clan, talking in slurs at them, even after his death when he saw Sasuke. Sure he had \"one of the good ones\" in his one Uchiha friend, but that doesn't negate his larger distrust of the Uchiha. And when even an evil but analytical motherfucker like Orochimaru can say, \"your policies caused the uprising\", you know there's something to it. \n\nAlso, I understand that members of the Uchiha also distrusted Madara, but so what? People of any group aren't a monolith. Even if a majority of people from a certain group believe something that doesn't mean they speak for that group, or that they even represent that group. \n\n\\>the Uchiha \"Curse of Hatred\"\n\nReally? If you're going to cite this as justification for their segregation and constant surveillance, then I'm not gonna bother with this debate after this. Even Tobirama, the Bull Connor of the Leaf Village, said they had this wrong. The Uchiha are most inclined to love. Literally what Hashirama and the racist- I mean Tobirama said. And just because Obito said it was right...so what?\n\n\\>Philosophy 301\n\nYou used the term \"moral relativism\", and assuming you really do have an understanding of that term, then I'm going to assume you have some real familiarity with philosophy. And if you do, then you know that in order for something to actually be a Universal, then it, by definition, must be provable in all cases. All. Every. It doesn't have to be disproven in 10, 100, 1,000 etc cases, only ONE. This is Philosophy 300 level stuff. So I'm simply going to say, \"Alfonso the Wise\" of Castille. There are others, but he's the least controversial, safest bet, and the one I'm most familiar with since I wrote my graduating paper on him and his political goals for my BA in History. \n\n\\>What betterment of the world?\n\nDo you really not think people living in a dream world where, as far they know, they get everything they want, never have to worry about conflict (unless they want it, in which case it only happens in their mind and nobody actually dies), and the real world is left to nature is not an objectively good thing?

That's your problem, you assume what I don't say.\nI didn't say that the village system didn't have massive problems from the get go or that it would fail eventually.\nI'm arguing that Madara never gave the system a chance once he became convinced he wouldn't be the one on top. I'm telling you that Madara did absolutely everything in his hand to sow distrust and resentment.\nThat Madara became such a threat for **everyone** that even a century after his death, the mere thought that he was behind the Akatsuki sent every big nation in a frenzy and moved them to war.\nIt is a fact that Madara try to fullfil his own prophecy. So it's obvious that he shouldn't get bragging rights when it becomes true.\n\nYou're right that in the first Kage summit, things were starting to get heated. But Hashirama pleaded with them and they relented, they actually did try to give peace a chance. The one who backstabbed that peace was Madara, he was the one who went around bullying other nations. And wether you want to admit it or not, we know that his encounter with Onoki shattered the latter and changed his worldview entirely... This man would rule Iwakagure for sixty plus years.\n\nHow can his blabbering of peace fit with his warmongering and imperialistic attitudes?? It can't.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>You say that Madara had a hand in creating that world, but he didn't. The machinations of such a world were already in existence way before Madara or Hashirama made the first Village. Madara may have taken some extreme steps, but war between Villages over Village politics or because of Feudal Lord demands are inevitable because of the very nature of the universe.\n\nOh he very much did, this is a fact. It's likely that Peace wouldn't have lasted forever?? Sure, no peace is eternal.\nIt's a fact that there was peace and Madara went screwing things up as per usual. \nMadara and Hashirama changed and shaped the world when they created the village system. \nWe have people struggling to achieve peace and then we have Madara the imperialist warmonger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Really? Do you really think that the Uchiha would not have been persecuted had it not been for Madara?\n\nYes. The very reason Tobirama was wary of them was because he knew another Madara could rise among them.\nThe very reason why decades later the higher ups move against them is because they are convinced that an Uchiha had attacked the Leaf with Kurama, in trust **Madara's disciple had done so, knowing he would frame his clan**. The only reason they have this suspicion is because Madara did in the past. \n\n\n\n>The ruling clan of the Village were the rival clan of the Uchiha, and they only formed a peace treaty because they had a Great Man of History in Hashirama\n\nThat's the thing... **They were not the ruling clan**.\nOne of their own became Hokage, that's very different from the whole clan ruling.\n\nTobirama was also in favour for peace, even since he was child. He went on record insulting the adults, both Uchiha and Senju, and arguing that if they really wanted peace, they should forget the bad blood, sign accords and stick to them.\n\n\n\n>Tobirama disliked the Uchiha as a clan, talking in slurs at them, even after his death when he saw Sasuke. \n\nNo such thing happened.\nHe said that he wasn't surprised that an Uchiha associated himself with scoundrel like Orochimaru.\n\n\n\n\n\n>Sure he had \"one of the good ones\" in his one Uchiha friend, but that doesn't negate his larger distrust of the Uchiha.\n\nHe never denies that one. \nHe also explains why he was wary of them. It's obvious that any clan cursed with being genetically predisposed to go mad and the crazier the got the more op they became was a motive for worrying.\nSeems funny that you were talking big about realpolitik a paragraph ago but went full Hashirama here.\n\n\n\n\n>And when even an evil but analytical motherfucker like Orochimaru can say, \"your policies caused the uprising\", you know there's something to it. \n\nNothing Orochimaru said made any sense. \nThis is highlighted with the fact that the Uchiha actually loved their position as Military Police.\nOrochi also act like people naturally distrust officers and it isn't their actions what turn people on them.\nPeople also forget that Orochi also said that  the Uchiha became super arrogant due their power and position... \n\nWe can discuss this in full but no, his policies had nothing to do with it. \n\n\n\n>Also, I understand that members of the Uchiha also distrusted Madara, but so what? People of any group aren't a monolith. Even if a majority of people from a certain group believe something that doesn't mean they speak for that group, or that they even represent that group. \n\n\n- If the majority of a group doesn't represent that group... Who does?\n\n- Madara said that not a single member of his clan supported him in his uprising and they all turned their backs on him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Even Tobirama, the Bull Connor of the Leaf Village, said they had this wrong. The Uchiha are most inclined to love\n\nHe never said that this was wrong lol.\nHe said that it's wrong the saying that *the Senju love more intensely than the Uchiha*.\n\nHe said that the Uchiha love more but that once they lose the thing they love they start losing it little by little and the physical manifestation of that is the Sharingan.\nThe more the lose it, the more strong they get.\n\n\n\n\n\n>Literally what Hashirama and the racist- I mean Tobirama said. And just because Obito said it was right...so what?\n\nWow, we have abandoned any perception of neutrality. We just went full racist Tobirama meme.\n\nYou don't have to believe it just because Obito supports it, it's simply a curiosity, there's enough evidence for it enough. Starting for the fact that both Black Zetsu and Indra forced the wrong path onto the Uchiha.\nThis is the same clan that used to kill each other for their eyes and all that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>So I'm simply going to say, \"Alfonso the Wise\" of Castille. There are others, but he's the least controversial, safest bet, and the one I'm most familiar with since I wrote my graduating paper on him and his political goals for my BA in History. \n\n\nI did ask you for ten. You only give me one.\nThe one you think it's the most morally good. Which is someone that forced ethnic cleansing on his lands...  If they are controversial then you know already that they are not morally good lol.\nYou either are confusing morally with great ruler or you simply felt the need to answer.\n\n\n\nI ask you again, what morally good choice did Madara ever do in his quest for power?\n\n\n\n>Do you really not think people living in a dream world where, as far they know, they get everything they want, never have to worry about conflict (unless they want it, in which case it only happens in their mind and nobody actually dies), and the real world is left to nature is not an objectively good thing? By all manners that we quantify \"goodness\", that hits the mark.\n\nLol no, I think that a world of sleeping slaves that are forced to be drugged forever without having any experience whatsoever except that of their dreams.\nNo, dreaming forever is not good. It's hell for me.\nIf you believe that living your life in a comatose sleep is the ultimate goal, by all means do that. Just don't **force it** on the rest of us. That's something Madara ever understood either, diplomacy and free will.",

I did not mean when Hashirama first proposes the Village system, or even when their village starts to take off, I mean when the village starts to take form, it was still in it's feudal stages, and then after he reads the Uchiha tablet.\n\n And before you oversimplify the tablet reading, keep in mind this is a universe where there are ancient all-powerful magic beasts, ancient super-moves are written on ancient scrolls, the Sage of the 6thfold Path is literally incarnated, Princess Kaguya is a demon monster, and the Shinto Pantheon are materialized in super techniques. So in that context, believing an ancient tablet makes a lot of fucking sense.\n\n\\>Blaming Madara for the failure of the Village system because he fucked around too much\n\nAgain, Im not saying Madara didn't do bad things, including sowing distrust amongst the villages, but if you think that HE'S the reason it didn't work, then idk if you're just incapable of larger critiques of structures in general, if you just refuse to, or if you are just are naive. The entire universe is based on the Sengoku Jidai, and Shinobi clans in service to feudal lords. In-universe, the legitimacy of the bigger villages is entirely based on having support from a feudal lord and protecting said feudal lord. Aside from the conflicts between rival villages rooted in rivalries between clans, there is also underlying conflicts in the Feudal Lords ever sought war between nations. Such a world would be in constant chaos without Madara or the Akatsuki. Just like the Sengoku period. So did Madara do a lot to sow divisions? Maybe. But you are naive if you think that would have made a larger difference. Hell, even at the first Kage summit, they were all in distrust and threatened the Sand Village with war for making a reasonable demand. No attempt to compromise, just \"we'll gang up on you\" until Hashirama had to cry to get them to at least talk to each other. \n\nYou say that Madara had a hand in creating that world, but he didn't. The machinations of such a world were already in existence way before Madara or Hashirama made the first Village. Madara may have taken some extreme steps, but war between Villages over Village politics or because of Feudal Lord demands are inevitable because of the very nature of the universe.\n\n\\>Disturst between the Uchiha and the larger village\n\nReally? Do you really think that the Uchiha would not have been persecuted had it not been for Madara? The ruling clan of the Village were the rival clan of the Uchiha, and they only formed a peace treaty because they had a Great Man of History in Hashirama. Tobirama disliked the Uchiha as a clan, talking in slurs at them, even after his death when he saw Sasuke. Sure he had \"one of the good ones\" in his one Uchiha friend, but that doesn't negate his larger distrust of the Uchiha. And when even an evil but analytical motherfucker like Orochimaru can say, \"your policies caused the uprising\", you know there's something to it. \n\nAlso, I understand that members of the Uchiha also distrusted Madara, but so what? People of any group aren't a monolith. Even if a majority of people from a certain group believe something that doesn't mean they speak for that group, or that they even represent that group. \n\n\\>the Uchiha \"Curse of Hatred\"\n\nReally? If you're going to cite this as justification for their segregation and constant surveillance, then I'm not gonna bother with this debate after this. Even Tobirama, the Bull Connor of the Leaf Village, said they had this wrong. The Uchiha are most inclined to love. Literally what Hashirama and the racist- I mean Tobirama said. And just because Obito said it was right...so what?\n\n\\>Philosophy 301\n\nYou used the term \"moral relativism\", and assuming you really do have an understanding of that term, then I'm going to assume you have some real familiarity with philosophy. And if you do, then you know that in order for something to actually be a Universal, then it, by definition, must be provable in all cases. All. Every. It doesn't have to be disproven in 10, 100, 1,000 etc cases, only ONE. This is Philosophy 300 level stuff. So I'm simply going to say, \"Alfonso the Wise\" of Castille. There are others, but he's the least controversial, safest bet, and the one I'm most familiar with since I wrote my graduating paper on him and his political goals for my BA in History. \n\n\\>What betterment of the world?\n\nDo you really not think people living in a dream world where, as far they know, they get everything they want, never have to worry about conflict (unless they want it, in which case it only happens in their mind and nobody actually dies), and the real world is left to nature is not an objectively good thing? By all manners that we quantify \"goodness\", that hits the mark.",

I'm telling you that Madara did absolutely everything in his hand to sow distrust and resentment.\nThat Madara became such a threat for **everyone** that even a century after his death, the mere thought that he was behind the Akatsuki sent every big nation in a frenzy and moved them to war.\nIt is a fact that Madara try to fullfil his own prophecy. So it's obvious that he shouldn't get bragging rights when it becomes true.\n\nYou're right that in the first Kage summit, things were starting to get heated. But Hashirama pleaded with them and they relented, they actually did try to give peace a chance. The one who backstabbed that peace was Madara, he was the one who went around bullying other nations. And wether you want to admit it or not, we know that his encounter with Onoki shattered the latter and changed his worldview entirely... This man would rule Iwakagure for sixty plus years.\n\nHow can his blabbering of peace fit with his warmongering and imperialistic attitudes?? It can't.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>You say that Madara had a hand in creating that world, but he didn't.

It's likely that Peace wouldn't have lasted forever?? Sure, no peace is eternal.\nIt's a fact that there was peace and Madara went screwing things up as per usual. \nMadara and Hashirama changed and shaped the world when they created the village system. \nWe have people struggling to achieve peace and then we have Madara the imperialist warmonger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Really?

The only reason they have this suspicion is because Madara did in the past. \n\n\n\n>The ruling clan of the Village were the rival clan of the Uchiha, and they only formed a peace treaty because they had a Great Man of History in Hashirama\n\nThat's the thing... **They were not the ruling clan**.\nOne of their own became Hokage, that's very different from the whole clan ruling.\n\nTobirama was also in favour for peace, even since he was child. He went on record insulting the adults, both Uchiha and Senju, and arguing that if they really wanted peace, they should forget the bad blood, sign accords and stick to them.\n\n\n\n>Tobirama disliked the Uchiha as a clan, talking in slurs at them, even after his death when he saw Sasuke. \n\nNo such thing happened.\nHe said that he wasn't surprised that an Uchiha associated himself with scoundrel like Orochimaru.\n\n\n\n\n\n>Sure he had \"one of the good ones\" in his one Uchiha friend, but that doesn't negate his larger distrust of the Uchiha.\n\nHe never denies that one. \nHe also explains why he was wary of them.

And just because Obito said it was right...so what?\n\nWow, we have abandoned any perception of neutrality. We just went full racist Tobirama meme.\n\nYou don't have to believe it just because Obito supports it, it's simply a curiosity, there's enough evidence for it enough.

You only give me one.\nThe one you think it's the most morally good. Which is someone that forced ethnic cleansing on his lands...  If they are controversial then you know already that they are not morally good lol.\nYou either are confusing morally with great ruler or you simply felt the need to answer.\n\n\n\nI ask you again, what morally good choice did Madara ever do in his quest for power?\n\n\n\n>Do you really not think people living in a dream world where, as far they know, they get everything they want, never have to worry about conflict (unless they want it, in which case it only happens in their mind and nobody actually dies), and the real world is left to nature is not an objectively good thing? By all manners that we quantify \"goodness\", that hits the mark.\n\nLol no, I think that a world of sleeping slaves that are forced to be drugged forever without having any experience whatsoever except that of their dreams.\nNo, dreaming forever is not good. It's hell for me.\nIf you believe that living your life in a comatose sleep is the ultimate goal, by all means do that. Just don't **force it** on the rest of us.

The Uchiha are most inclined to love\n\nHe never said that this was wrong lol.\nHe said that it's wrong the saying that *the Senju love more intensely than the Uchiha*.\n\nHe said that the Uchiha love more but that once they lose the thing they love they start losing it little by little and the physical manifestation of that is the Sharingan.\nThe more the lose it, the more strong they get.\n\n\n\n\n\n>Literally what Hashirama and the racist- I mean Tobirama said. And just because Obito said it was right...so what?\n\nWow, we have abandoned any perception of neutrality. We just went full racist Tobirama meme.\n\nYou don't have to believe it just because Obito supports it, it's simply a curiosity, there's enough evidence for it enough. Starting for the fact that both Black Zetsu and Indra forced the wrong path onto the Uchiha.\nThis is the same clan that used to kill each other for their eyes and all that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>So I'm simply going to say, \"Alfonso the Wise\" of Castille. There are others, but he's the least controversial, safest bet, and the one I'm most familiar with since I wrote my graduating paper on him and his political goals for my BA in History. \n\n\nI did ask you for ten. You only give me one.\nThe one you think it's the most morally good. Which is someone that forced ethnic cleansing on his lands...  If they are controversial then you know already that they are not morally good lol.\nYou either are confusing morally with great ruler or you simply felt the need to answer.\n\n\n\nI ask you again, what morally good choice did Madara ever do in his quest for power?\n\n\n\n>Do you really not think people living in a dream world where, as far they know, they get everything they want, never have to worry about conflict (unless they want it, in which case it only happens in their mind and nobody actually dies), and the real world is left to nature is not an objectively good thing? By all manners that we quantify \"goodness\", that hits the mark.\n\nLol no, I think that a world of sleeping slaves that are forced to be drugged forever without having any experience whatsoever except that of their dreams.\nNo, dreaming forever is not good. It's hell for me.\nIf you believe that living your life in a comatose sleep is the ultimate goal, by all means do that. Just don't **force it** on the rest of us. That's something Madara ever understood either, diplomacy and free will.",
