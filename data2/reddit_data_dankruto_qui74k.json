I dont know of any ancient civilization with child soldiers, only that they were trained since they were children. Though we see child soldiers being used at present by terrorists for easier targets I guess. \n\nAnd the moral evolution is very loosely based anyway. No one ever complained about their kids going to war so that has become the norm, its a part of the \"ninja way\" or the \"will of fire\".",

Naruto has shadow clones because he had dummy thicc chakra reserves and is a loner that grows stronger thanks to the help of others. Sasuke is an emotionally damaged child that is single mindedly focused on one goal at the detrimental of everything else and he sees stuff good, so he gets an attack that's hard to aim right and forces you forward unable to slow down, tearing a hole through everything in its way.\n\nHe also sets stuff on fire by looking at it because he wants to watch the world burn, learns to shape those flames born of hatred as he learns to weaponize his own angst like a sith, and he summons a giant soul mecha shell to protect him because his heart is withdrawn and shielded from others. Also Naruto uses Kurama because again, he grows stronger with the help of those around him. I don't know if Kishimoto does these on purpose, but I'm sure he does subconsciously at the very least. Our brains make patterns whether we understand them or not.\n\nBonus: Obito, who disappeared from the world, has a power that lets him escape the world he no longer believes in, while Kakashi who has survivors guilt is forced to stare at others and watch them dissappear instead. Itachi can create the most powerful illusions that put a massive strain on the user's brains, because Itachi is forced to live a painful lie until that's nearly all that's left of his identity. Kabuto can use medical ninjutsu because at his core he's a broken person. During the war, he learns to bring people back to life, just as he believes he's finally moved on from being dead inside himself after absorbing his master and evolving past an ordinary human, but just like the edo tensei he creates, he's only fixed himself on the outside, because inside he's still dead.",

I dont know of any ancient civilization with child soldiers, only that they were trained since they were children. Though we see child soldiers being used at present by terrorists for easier targets I guess. \n\nAnd the moral evolution is very loosely based anyway. No one ever complained about their kids going to war so that has become the norm, its a part of the \"ninja way\" or the \"will of fire\".",

Naruto has shadow clones because he had dummy thicc chakra reserves and is a loner that grows stronger thanks to the help of others. Sasuke is an emotionally damaged child that is single mindedly focused on one goal at the detrimental of everything else and he sees stuff good, so he gets an attack that's hard to aim right and forces you forward unable to slow down, tearing a hole through everything in its way.\n\nHe also sets stuff on fire by looking at it because he wants to watch the world burn, learns to shape those flames born of hatred as he learns to weaponize his own angst like a sith, and he summons a giant soul mecha shell to protect him because his heart is withdrawn and shielded from others. Also Naruto uses Kurama because again, he grows stronger with the help of those around him. I don't know if Kishimoto does these on purpose, but I'm sure he does subconsciously at the very least. Our brains make patterns whether we understand them or not.\n\nBonus: Obito, who disappeared from the world, has a power that lets him escape the world he no longer believes in, while Kakashi who has survivors guilt is forced to stare at others and watch them dissappear instead. Itachi can create the most powerful illusions that put a massive strain on the user's brains, because Itachi is forced to live a painful lie until that's nearly all that's left of his identity. Kabuto can use medical ninjutsu because at his core he's a broken person. During the war, he learns to bring people back to life, just as he believes he's finally moved on from being dead inside himself after absorbing his master and evolving past an ordinary human, but just like the edo tensei he creates, he's only fixed himself on the outside, because inside he's still dead.",

I dont know of any ancient civilization with child soldiers, only that they were trained since they were children. Though we see child soldiers being used at present by terrorists for easier targets I guess. \n\nAnd the moral evolution is very loosely based anyway. No one ever complained about their kids going to war so that has become the norm, its a part of the \"ninja way\" or the \"will of fire\".",

Sasuke is an emotionally damaged child that is single mindedly focused on one goal at the detrimental of everything else and he sees stuff good, so he gets an attack that's hard to aim right and forces you forward unable to slow down, tearing a hole through everything in its way.\n\nHe also sets stuff on fire by looking at it because he wants to watch the world burn, learns to shape those flames born of hatred as he learns to weaponize his own angst like a sith, and he summons a giant soul mecha shell to protect him because his heart is withdrawn and shielded from others. Also Naruto uses Kurama because again, he grows stronger with the help of those around him. I don't know if Kishimoto does these on purpose, but I'm sure he does subconsciously at the very least. Our brains make patterns whether we understand them or not.\n\nBonus: Obito, who disappeared from the world, has a power that lets him escape the world he no longer believes in, while Kakashi who has survivors guilt is forced to stare at others and watch them dissappear instead. Itachi can create the most powerful illusions that put a massive strain on the user's brains, because Itachi is forced to live a painful lie until that's nearly all that's left of his identity. Kabuto can use medical ninjutsu because at his core he's a broken person. During the war, he learns to bring people back to life, just as he believes he's finally moved on from being dead inside himself after absorbing his master and evolving past an ordinary human, but just like the edo tensei he creates, he's only fixed himself on the outside, because inside he's still dead.",

Not only that but Lightning\u2019s property/attribute is piercing which again none of Kumo shinobi need a sharingan to use lightning jutsu effectively. Not only that but it\u2019s supposed to be an assassination technique, how does it make sense for an assassination technique needing to be \u201ccharged up\u201d by running at someone who can hear you from a mile away due to how loud the jutsu itself is?

Though we see child soldiers being used at present by terrorists for easier targets I guess. \n\nAnd the moral evolution is very loosely based anyway. No one ever complained about their kids going to war so that has become the norm, its a part of the \"ninja way\" or the \"will of fire\".",

Naruto has shadow clones because he had dummy thicc chakra reserves and is a loner that grows stronger thanks to the help of others. Sasuke is an emotionally damaged child that is single mindedly focused on one goal at the detrimental of everything else and he sees stuff good, so he gets an attack that's hard to aim right and forces you forward unable to slow down, tearing a hole through everything in its way.\n\nHe also sets stuff on fire by looking at it because he wants to watch the world burn, learns to shape those flames born of hatred as he learns to weaponize his own angst like a sith, and he summons a giant soul mecha shell to protect him because his heart is withdrawn and shielded from others. Also Naruto uses Kurama because again, he grows stronger with the help of those around him. I don't know if Kishimoto does these on purpose, but I'm sure he does subconsciously at the very least. Our brains make patterns whether we understand them or not.\n\nBonus: Obito, who disappeared from the world, has a power that lets him escape the world he no longer believes in, while Kakashi who has survivors guilt is forced to stare at others and watch them dissappear instead. Itachi can create the most powerful illusions that put a massive strain on the user's brains, because Itachi is forced to live a painful lie until that's nearly all that's left of his identity. Kabuto can use medical ninjutsu because at his core he's a broken person. During the war, he learns to bring people back to life, just as he believes he's finally moved on from being dead inside himself after absorbing his master and evolving past an ordinary human, but just like the edo tensei he creates, he's only fixed himself on the outside, because inside he's still dead.",
