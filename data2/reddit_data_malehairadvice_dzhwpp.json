Leaving something for future you to do is probably going to end up getting postponed again if you haven't changed the way you think about doing shit you don't really want to do. Stop idolising planning and start trying and learning through experience. How?\n\n*Make incremental lifestyle changes.* Choose to be a slightly better version of yourself every day. What exactly should you do?\n\nJoin r/loseit, start counting calories and become aware of your diet. You don't have to start a \"diet\", cut what you eat in half or anything too extreme, or it's not going to last. Changing your body is a marathon, like sculpting a statue, you do it slowly, surely and *consistently.* So for the first week, just learn CICO - track how much you eat, how much you spend. 2nd week, start eating 300-500 calories less than you spend (stop drinking calories and try to minimise sugar as eating sugar makes you crave more sugar and it spirals into eating tons of not-very-nutritious calories - intermittent fasting can help if this is your case). Also start meal by drinking water, soup and eating vegetables and meat first - this will fill you up and make it easier not to eat too much rice/pasta/bread/potatoes etc. You'll make mistakes along the way, cheat days happen, but it's just a stumble in a long run - don't feel too bad or like you've ruined the progress you've made until then - shake it off and *keep going*.\n\nAfter a couple weeks you should be noticing some progress - time to start going to the gym. Hopefully this would be before 1st of January because the gym will be packed and you'll lack the freedom of taking your time. For routines a full body 3-day split would be good combined with cardio. If you struggle going to the gym though, try going *every single day*. You don't have to do anything when you get there, you can just do some stretches and warmup then leave, but you'll probably feel like you might as well do something since you're already there. Try some walking, running, cycling, anything. If you feel up to it, do some resistance training after.\n\nAnd *keep going*, because you *can* do it and it'll all be worth it. I won't spoil the tons of benefits and lifestyle improvements you will notice, guess you'll just have to see for yourself. ^(Also your hair looks great, no reason to change it and not the thing you should be focusing on, imo.)",

Leaving something for future you to do is probably going to end up getting postponed again if you haven't changed the way you think about doing shit you don't really want to do. Stop idolising planning and start trying and learning through experience. How?\n\n*Make incremental lifestyle changes.* Choose to be a slightly better version of yourself every day. What exactly should you do?\n\nJoin r/loseit, start counting calories and become aware of your diet. You don't have to start a \"diet\", cut what you eat in half or anything too extreme, or it's not going to last. Changing your body is a marathon, like sculpting a statue, you do it slowly, surely and *consistently.* So for the first week, just learn CICO - track how much you eat, how much you spend. 2nd week, start eating 300-500 calories less than you spend (stop drinking calories and try to minimise sugar as eating sugar makes you crave more sugar and it spirals into eating tons of not-very-nutritious calories - intermittent fasting can help if this is your case). Also start meal by drinking water, soup and eating vegetables and meat first - this will fill you up and make it easier not to eat too much rice/pasta/bread/potatoes etc. You'll make mistakes along the way, cheat days happen, but it's just a stumble in a long run - don't feel too bad or like you've ruined the progress you've made until then - shake it off and *keep going*.\n\nAfter a couple weeks you should be noticing some progress - time to start going to the gym. Hopefully this would be before 1st of January because the gym will be packed and you'll lack the freedom of taking your time. For routines a full body 3-day split would be good combined with cardio. If you struggle going to the gym though, try going *every single day*. You don't have to do anything when you get there, you can just do some stretches and warmup then leave, but you'll probably feel like you might as well do something since you're already there. Try some walking, running, cycling, anything. If you feel up to it, do some resistance training after.\n\nAnd *keep going*, because you *can* do it and it'll all be worth it. I won't spoil the tons of benefits and lifestyle improvements you will notice, guess you'll just have to see for yourself. ^(Also your hair looks great, no reason to change it and not the thing you should be focusing on, imo.)",

Leaving something for future you to do is probably going to end up getting postponed again if you haven't changed the way you think about doing shit you don't really want to do. Stop idolising planning and start trying and learning through experience. How?\n\n*Make incremental lifestyle changes.* Choose to be a slightly better version of yourself every day. What exactly should you do?\n\nJoin r/loseit, start counting calories and become aware of your diet. You don't have to start a \"diet\", cut what you eat in half or anything too extreme, or it's not going to last. Changing your body is a marathon, like sculpting a statue, you do it slowly, surely and *consistently.* So for the first week, just learn CICO - track how much you eat, how much you spend. 2nd week, start eating 300-500 calories less than you spend (stop drinking calories and try to minimise sugar as eating sugar makes you crave more sugar and it spirals into eating tons of not-very-nutritious calories - intermittent fasting can help if this is your case). Also start meal by drinking water, soup and eating vegetables and meat first - this will fill you up and make it easier not to eat too much rice/pasta/bread/potatoes etc. You'll make mistakes along the way, cheat days happen, but it's just a stumble in a long run - don't feel too bad or like you've ruined the progress you've made until then - shake it off and *keep going*.\n\nAfter a couple weeks you should be noticing some progress - time to start going to the gym. Hopefully this would be before 1st of January because the gym will be packed and you'll lack the freedom of taking your time. For routines a full body 3-day split would be good combined with cardio. If you struggle going to the gym though, try going *every single day*. You don't have to do anything when you get there, you can just do some stretches and warmup then leave, but you'll probably feel like you might as well do something since you're already there. Try some walking, running, cycling, anything. If you feel up to it, do some resistance training after.\n\nAnd *keep going*, because you *can* do it and it'll all be worth it. I won't spoil the tons of benefits and lifestyle improvements you will notice, guess you'll just have to see for yourself. ^(Also your hair looks great, no reason to change it and not the thing you should be focusing on, imo.)",
