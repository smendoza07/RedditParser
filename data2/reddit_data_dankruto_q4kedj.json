I think part of the reason for this is the drastic changes in the Naruto world during this time. They were moving away from an era of open war so cultivation of young ninja was less harsh.",

Theoretically either of these (and Gaara) has a solid chance to defend against Obito with the constant presence of the iron sand/gold. But we can also safely assume neither of them is faster than Minato, whom barely managed to escape Kamui. \nOhnoki is a different beast altogether. Absolutely terrifying Kage, easily the strongest during the summit. While he couldn't escape Kamui, I think the only thing that would've been kamui'd is an earth clone while he scouts.\n16 years ago, we can assume Third Raikage was the active one as Minato met fourth in battle before either was Kage. The Raikage are all incredibly fast Shinobi. I could see him escaping. \nAs for Mizukage, we saw Ohnoki was the Tsuchikage during Obito giving Kakashi his sharingan, so safe to assume Muu was dead. Meaning second Mizukage was also dead. Yagura is the fourth Mizukage but quite young, meaning the third Mizukage was the active Mizukage. We know nothing about him except that he served as the bodyguard of the first Mizukage. \n\nI think Raikage & Tsuchikage would have a fair chance against Obito. \nKazekage would be kamui'd and given how little we know of third Mizukage he's probably a jobber.",

Not really sure what prevented Obito from using genjutsu on Minato like he did Yaagura though. Hard to say if he could do that to other kage.",

Theoretically either of these (and Gaara) has a solid chance to defend against Obito with the constant presence of the iron sand/gold. But we can also safely assume neither of them is faster than Minato, whom barely managed to escape Kamui. \nOhnoki is a different beast altogether. Absolutely terrifying Kage, easily the strongest during the summit. While he couldn't escape Kamui, I think the only thing that would've been kamui'd is an earth clone while he scouts.\n16 years ago, we can assume Third Raikage was the active one as Minato met fourth in battle before either was Kage. The Raikage are all incredibly fast Shinobi. I could see him escaping. \nAs for Mizukage, we saw Ohnoki was the Tsuchikage during Obito giving Kakashi his sharingan, so safe to assume Muu was dead. Meaning second Mizukage was also dead. Yagura is the fourth Mizukage but quite young, meaning the third Mizukage was the active Mizukage. We know nothing about him except that he served as the bodyguard of the first Mizukage. \n\nI think Raikage & Tsuchikage would have a fair chance against Obito. \nKazekage would be kamui'd and given how little we know of third Mizukage he's probably a jobber.",

Theoretically either of these (and Gaara) has a solid chance to defend against Obito with the constant presence of the iron sand/gold. But we can also safely assume neither of them is faster than Minato, whom barely managed to escape Kamui. \nOhnoki is a different beast altogether. Absolutely terrifying Kage, easily the strongest during the summit. While he couldn't escape Kamui, I think the only thing that would've been kamui'd is an earth clone while he scouts.\n16 years ago, we can assume Third Raikage was the active one as Minato met fourth in battle before either was Kage. The Raikage are all incredibly fast Shinobi. I could see him escaping. \nAs for Mizukage, we saw Ohnoki was the Tsuchikage during Obito giving Kakashi his sharingan, so safe to assume Muu was dead. Meaning second Mizukage was also dead. Yagura is the fourth Mizukage but quite young, meaning the third Mizukage was the active Mizukage. We know nothing about him except that he served as the bodyguard of the first Mizukage. \n\nI think Raikage & Tsuchikage would have a fair chance against Obito. \nKazekage would be kamui'd and given how little we know of third Mizukage he's probably a jobber.",

Theoretically either of these (and Gaara) has a solid chance to defend against Obito with the constant presence of the iron sand/gold. But we can also safely assume neither of them is faster than Minato, whom barely managed to escape Kamui. \nOhnoki is a different beast altogether. Absolutely terrifying Kage, easily the strongest during the summit. While he couldn't escape Kamui, I think the only thing that would've been kamui'd is an earth clone while he scouts.\n16 years ago, we can assume Third Raikage was the active one as Minato met fourth in battle before either was Kage. The Raikage are all incredibly fast Shinobi. I could see him escaping. \nAs for Mizukage, we saw Ohnoki was the Tsuchikage during Obito giving Kakashi his sharingan, so safe to assume Muu was dead. Meaning second Mizukage was also dead. Yagura is the fourth Mizukage but quite young, meaning the third Mizukage was the active Mizukage. We know nothing about him except that he served as the bodyguard of the first Mizukage. \n\nI think Raikage & Tsuchikage would have a fair chance against Obito. \nKazekage would be kamui'd and given how little we know of third Mizukage he's probably a jobber.",
