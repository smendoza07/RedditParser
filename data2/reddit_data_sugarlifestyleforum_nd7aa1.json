    "body": "I wish I knew this subreddit existed long before I entered the sugar bowl. I went into this thinking my wits and charm was all I needed to get a decent arrangement but I was so wrong. \n\nYou would think if a young lady is seeking financial support, people would see that as an opportunity to provide that help in a mutually beneficial SR. It makes me cringe thinking about how I propositioned myself to these men and the amount of trust I placed for them to hold up their end of the arrangement. Quite the disheartening experience but guess you live and you learn.  \n\nI\u2019ll go first, I used to have intimacy on the first date and, therefore, was nothing more than a booty call for these guys. Also, occasionally gave out my real number and one time had a M&G at MY APARTMENT. \n\nDownvote me into oblivion, I deserve it.\n\nEDIT: You guys are SO FREAKING PRECIOUS. Thank you for not judging my mishaps and sharing your stories. I hope we all learn something from each other and continue looking out for one another \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffc",

She mentioned financial help, along with other things (like respect, dinner out, etc), but we didn't talk about anything in specific. M&G was dinner. Over dessert I asked if she wanted to come back to my place and she said yes. We ended up having sex (great sex) and I took her home. No discussion of money at all.\n\nThe next morning I didn't really know what to do. I asked her for her venmo so I could send her something, and sent her $xxx. We saw each other a couple of times after that.\n\nSo, I ended up getting it right, but I was definitely clueless.\n\nEdit: btw, we both used our real numbers. Definitely don't do that anymore.",

Two platonic dates which were nice (and I found her quite attractive) but she plied cash out of me at the end of them. Then when we met at a hotel I paid for the room, we met in the room, and she did a \"I can't go through with this.\" I had not given her any cash (yet) that time so I was just out the room.  She was not new to SA then, so I'm not entirely sure what her strategy was to bail before getting more cash out of me. Maybe she just wasn't that into me??\n\nWeirdness: Met an SB while traveling. Had a nice intimate evening.  A month later I get a text saying it's her mom, she's in intensive care, OD'd on unknown drugs, she found my number in the phone and wants to know if I know who sold her the drugs. I responded that I met her a month ago, do not live in her city, and am really sorry but couldn't help. She apparently recovered as I did see her on SA again afterwards. I was *not* stupid enough to see her again the next time I was in her city.",

Dinner she is being a bit weird, Apple store she is happy, hotel we crawl into bed and she says that she doesn\u2019t like my body odor (in general - not that particular day) so she doesn\u2019t want to fuck. And she decided she\u2019s getting back together with her boyfriend.  In my head I\u2019m wondering if she still wants the MacBook.  I realize I\u2019ll have to go along with whatever - who knows how fucking crazy she is.  I mean\u2026we just spent the last 4 hours together.  Maybe if I try to keep it she will try to call the police or some weird shit.  So I drop her off at home: \u201cok. Good luck with your boyfriend\u201d.  She takes the MacBook.  Of course.  3 weeks later the texts begging me to go out with her again.  Uhhhh.  No.  Hard pass",

            "body": "Well, this is more of an 'almost' story, but letting a guy send me an Uber to come to the city without making sure I had a ride home. It was far, 2 hours I think? My car was having problems so it was his suggestion that he send an Uber for our date  We ended up having an intimate date, gave me a ppm, but then didn't want to pay the uber to send me back home?! \n\nThis was around 5pm, an afternoon delight kind of thing and then he went for a meeting, leaving me literally outside in the cold just as it was getting dark. I had to keep calling him begging to cover the ride home. I couldn't have used the ppm to get home even if I wanted to because the app wasn't working, and anyways I needed the money to cover the babysitter, so I was absolutely relying on him. If a taxi is too expensive for you, find a girl who lives down the street please, instead of going after me when you know I am far away and transportation costs extra.\n\nThe silver lining is that he finally did get me the ride and I ended up making friends with the Uber driver, a fellow single mom, and we just bonded the whole ride back, talking about life. I still talk to her (the driver) but not to the SD, obviously. \n\nTl;dr I didn't make sure a SD arranged for my transportation to go home after a date. He left me standing on a dark street in the cold. Finally begrudgingly agreed to send me an Uber home, and I made more of a lasting connection with the driver than the SD.",
