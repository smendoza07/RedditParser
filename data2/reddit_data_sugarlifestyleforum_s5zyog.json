    "body": "Welcome to my TED Talk!\n\nI put my 8 years of sugaring into a big spreadsheet and crunched some numbers. I calculated the inflation-adjusted amounts and conducted a cost/benefit analysis. I post this because SDs may find it interesting or self-reflect on their own history. However, this may also benefit SBs to know how an SD like me thinks and dates.\n\n*Note: If anyone would like the spreadsheet with the raw data, DM me. You can then plug in your own numbers!*\n\nTo understand my analysis you must first understand **my** goals. Goals :\n\n1. **Sugar Relations.** My (SD aged 40) primary driver is a sugar relationship with an SB (21 to 45). Who I can give allowance while while we have fun together and she makes my life more interesting/relaxing. In my data I found about **1 out of 3 POT** dates turned into **short term SBs** (lasting less than one year), **1 out of every 21 POT** dates turned into **long-term/multi-year SBs** (lasting a year or more). However, my goal has never been to make them last, sometimes it just happens.\n2. **Intimacy.** My cost/benefit analysis showed that **2.4 dates was the avg** before intimacy. I personally *avoid* intimacy on the first date (easiest way to get scammed or in trouble) but spending beyond **three dates is usually a deal-breaker for me.** I will sugar someone without intimacy, and have, but usually on a whim. For instance, if I decide I just want some extra company in a new city and I'm not going to be around for dates 2 or 3 anyways. Or if I'm gambling to see if we get there by date 4 or 5. In any case, intimacy is something I'm tracking because, while it's not everything, it is part of any relationship where both sides value the other. Of the 82 SBs, **I was not intimate with 16 at all**. For the rest, **1 out of 5**, by the second date (on that date or the one immediately after), intimacy had begun.\n\n**Definitions:**\n\nA **POT** or, 'rando' as I call them, are people who I met at least once off Seeking. I don't count all the ones I matched with and didn't meet or who never showed up.\n\nA **rinser** is someone I tried to meet or met but they either flaked, were scamming, or ghosted after date #1 while trying to get as much money out of the exchange as possible.\n\nA **SB** (or POT SB) is someone who shows up to a date and who is serious about sugar dating and serious about mutual benefit. Out of **246 POTS**, **82 progressed to SBs (3:1 ratio)**.\n\nA **Long-Term SB** is someone who I've offered an allowance or gifts or other things for more than 1 year.\n\nA **girlfriend** is someone who doesn't need an allowance and just wants to date. If they were previously my SB, they no longer want an allowance, which works out because generosity, vacations, and gifts are just part of what I offer while dating someone. I didn't track any of this because I'm crazy but not crazy enough to go figure all that out.\n\nA **Vanilla** is a regular girl with regular expectations. She usually doesn't even know about sugaring or does but tends to look down on it.\n\n**Gouda** are a **hypothetical** currency pegged 1:1 to the USD *(I hope the mods don't delete the post. This is historic and self-reflective, not about anything else. I tried to respect the rules.)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Statistics from my SB dating history (vanilla/non-SB dating is excluded):\n\nThere were a total of **246 POTs/randos** and **82 SBs** over 8 years\n\nI had **2 out of 82 convert from sugar to real relationships** where we have either been headed towards **engagement**. Neither actually got to engagement. **One still might** (the relationship is still on going).\n\n**Time Spent Sugaring =** 8 Years\n\n**Avg. no of POTs per year =** 30 (meet and greets/first dates)\n\n**Avg. no of SBs per year =** 3.4 (2+ dates emerging from the POTs)\n\n**Total Amount Spent on SBs (Dates + Sugar) =** 295K goudas (avg 21.6 K gouda per year), 348.5K (adjusted for inflation)\n\n**Total Amount Spent on SB Dates** **=** 40.7K goudas (to get to know a new person), 5.8K gouda annually\n\n**Total Amount Spent on POT Dates =** 122.1K goudas / 144.1K (inflation adj)\n\n**Total Amount Spent on Sugar =** 173.1K goudas / 204.3 (inflation adj)\n\n**Avg. Amount Spent per SB (Date + Sugar) =** 2.6K goudas / 3.1K (inflation adj)\n\n**Avg. Sugar Per Date (not counting date itself)\\* =** 2.1K goudas / 2.5K (inflation adj)\n\n\\* Note: While the average amount spent on a sugar (not including the date itself) was 2.5K gouda (per date) this doesn't reflect what any SB should necessarily expect. The 'average' includes the times I spent more for certain situations or certain people, outliers. To adjust for that, you'd use the median (instead of the average). The median was **1.5K gouda**.\n\n**Avg. Date Cost (not counting Sugar) =** 496 gouda / 585.2 (inflation adj)\n\n**No of Sugar Dates =** 204 (25.5 per year)\n\n**No of POT Dates =** 611 (76.3 per year)\n\n**Avg. no of Dates, Per SB before Intimacy =** 2.4\n\n**Ratio of Scammers/Rinsers/Flakes to genuine SBs** **=** 7:1 (1 out 7 was a rinser or scammer)\n\n**Number of Intimate Encounters with SBs =** 161 (1 out of every 3 SB dates led to intimacy)\n\n**My personal income over 8 years (net) =** 3.1M gouda (not including overall net worth)\n\n**Income to Sugar ratio =** 10:1 ( I spent **10%** of my annual income on sugar dating. A lot less than losing half my income plus half my net worth, to a divorce or spending a lot of money to impress regular girls.) Most experts suggest that at least **30% of your income should be discretionary**. So I use 1/3 of my discretionary income for sugaring, and still have 2/3 left to do whatever I want. Further, I've got a lot of investments, so at times parts of my net worth becomes liquid which means I'm rarely using my income at all.\n\n**Countries Sugared in =** 5\n\n**US Cities Sugared In =** 11\n\n**Online-only Sugar =** 1. Online-only is highly unlikely to happen with anyone. But in this case I dropped around 400 gouda on a model well known in her industry that I met on Seeking. I don't think she knew I recognized her from her profile and played dumb when we started chatting. She wouldn't do in-person but was okay to send me a bunch of videos of her playing with toys and doing other things to herself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Other Interesting Data:\n\n**Rinsers/Scammers/Thieves =**  5\n\n**SBs that lasted more than 1 year =** 5\n\n**Regular SB to Long Term SB Ratio =** 21:1 (1 in 20 chance for me to go long term with an SB)\n\n**Number of SBs my age or older =** 2\n\n**(Legit) Models =** 3 (people others might recognize in a magazine or runway)\n\n**(Legit) Actresses =** 3 (people others might recognize on TV or movie)\n\n**(Non-Legit) Influencers =** 1 (insufferable girl who posted on social media all the time and thinks she's on Real Housewives)\n\n**SBs who made me wait past my minimum (3 dates) that I was patient enough to get to intimacy anyways =** 4 (avg 4 dates).\n\n**Number of SBs who I dropped 5K+ goudas on** **=** 8\n\n**Number of SBs who I dropped 10K+ goudas on =** 4\n\n**Number of SBs who I dropped 50K+ goudas on =** 4 (I don't count most of this in the number spent sugaring because for 2 they became girlfriends, 2 it was on travel, gifts, shopping etc.)\n\n**Number of SBs who asked me to get their 'chest' done =** 1 (narrator: \"I didn't\")\n\n**Number of SBs who asked me to buy them a car =** 1 (narrator: \"I will.\")\n\n**Number of SBs who didn't ask for money/just wanted to date a man of a different class:** 3\n\n**Number of pregnancy scares =** 1\n\n**Number of Intimate Encounters with more than two at a time (a.k.a 3sms) =** 9 (this isn't something I expect but when it happens I appreciate it. It's encouraging to me because it shows the girl is confident and trusts me instead of trying to control/limit me.)\n\n**Number of Lifestyle Clubs Attended with SBs =** 3\n\n**No of STD tests paid for =** 5 (usually I wrap it up or ask to see the girl's if she has a recent one, I have mine done frequently). Never caught anything while sugar dating, not even Covid (knock on wood).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# My Sugar Census Data:\n\n**Black/African-American/African SBs Dated =** 20 (1 was African, the rest are African-American)\n\n**Caucasian/White SBs Dated =** 5 (non Latin)\n\n**Mixed Race SBs Dated =** 40 (mostly mixed black and white but some other interesting mixes in there)\n\n**Asian SBs Dated =** 2 (both Korean)\n\n**Latin SBs Dated =** 10 (includes Caucasian, black and mixed Latinas)\n\n**Indian SB Dated =** 1 (the rarest type of SB!)\n\n**Other SBs Dated =** 4\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# My Sugar Vanity Index:\n\n**10s (dimes) =** 8 (comps: Meghan Markle, Lisa Bonet/Mariah/Halle Berry/Stacy Dash in their prime)\n\n**9s (baddie) =** 8 (comps: Gal Gadot, Jennifer Lopez, Rihanna)\n\n**8s (fine) =** 14 (comps: Beyonce, Kelly Rowland post-2005, Eva Mendes, Rashida Jones)\n\n**7s (hot) =** 22 (comps: Doja Cat, Zendaya)\n\n**6s (cutie) =** 19 (comps: Gabrielle Union, Solange)\n\n**5s or less (nothing better to dos) =** 11 (comps: Tiffany Haddish, Mindy Kaling)\n\n**Average rating of SBs dated =** 7\n\n**Average rating of SBs dated  Multi-Year =** 8.8\n\n**Average rating of SBs transitioned into Real Relationships =** 9.5\n\nThe above is outward appearance only. Doesn't factor education or whatever else they might have had going on (creativity, intellect, personality) because all that is secondary to why I'd even date someone in the first place. My priorities before any of that: how attractive she is (what I have to look at), how she makes me feel, and how supportive/attentive she is (emotionally).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Cost/Benefit Comparison to My Life Before Sugar and Vanilla Dating\n\nWhen I was regular dating, I met A LOT less women. I'm not shy, but I'm not the kind of guy who knows how to 'approach' women either. I don't like 'clubs' and approaching women randomly (grocery store, mall, bars etc.) can lead to a landmine of negative reactions or accusations. So I just didn't.\n\nAt best I'd match with maybe 2 or 3 girls per year on apps (maybe one purely organically) and date them for a couple of months.\n\nThe girls I got then were great and attractive. I'd say organically I have always been able pull slightly above average girls (6s to 8s) no problem, but 10s? Not then. Admittedly, I was less wealthy back then so might be easier now, even Vanilla.\n\nThe cost of dating/traveling/gifts would be the same in Vanilla. However I'd guess the time to intimacy was twice as long, not guaranteed, and way less interesting (because many girls want to be viewed as more modest...until they don't)\n\n**No of Dates to intimacy with the average SB =** 2.4 dates = 1.1K gouda\n\n**No of Dates to intimacy with the average Vanilla =** 5 dates = 2.4K gouda\n\nAt **496 gouda per date**, I'm saving **1.3K** gouda per partner and getting a more controlled outcome. That extra money saved 'proving myself' to a vanilla woman.\n\nThis money saved on dates from my side, then goes back into her pocket in the form of sugar. So in addition to not wasting her own money 50/50 (or even 100% of her money) on guys her own age/class, she's now earning money while dating. Less games and time wasted for me, and she now doesn't feel like her time is costing her (at least it's not costing her money).\n\nUsing this c/b I realize that sugaring is actually only about **800 gouda** more per date than regular dating with none of the  **demands**, **expectations**, **criticisms** and **pressure** to get what they want (usually marriage) that comes from Vanillas.  SBs have none of that up front (though as it becomes longer term, some of these same issues will come up).\n\nYes, I am spending more in the long run (because I'm dating more). But I don't have to put in as much effort to date who I want, how I want, when I want, where I want.\n\nIs it worth **800 extra per date** to date beautiful women across the planet who would have turned me down hard if I ever approached them out and about? **Absolutely!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Avg. No of First Dates with POTs p/yr =** 30\n\n**Avg. No of First Dates with girls who became SBs p/yr =** 3.4\n\n**Avg. No of Dates with Vanillas (prior to Sugar) p/yr** = 3\n\nAnother adjustment needs to be made though, because the bulk of my sugaring has been in **the last 3 years**, vs the 5 before. 63% to be exact. So actually the numbers before 3 years ago go down by 37% while the numbers **in the last 3 years go up by 63%**.\n\n**Avg. No of Overall First Dates p/y with POTs (weighted for recency, since 2019) =** 30 = 48.9\n\n**Avg. No of First Dates p/y with SBs (weighted for recency, since 2019)  =** 3.4 = 5.5\n\nI'm going out/dating **16.3 times more** (which for me is great because I like to be social) while the rating of attractiveness has risen\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Intimacy Married vs. Sugaring\n\nPreviously, I was married but it led to a dead bedroom. My wife and I had our intimate times maybe three days a month or **36 times per year** (and that's being generous).\n\nNow, sugaring, I'm guessing at least **200 times per year** and of that, an average of **20 new girls a year**.\n\n**5 times as much with 20 times the women** has made me much happier and more satisfied with life. There's less risk to my fortune and less risk to my emotional well being. My ex-wife was not good for either.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Conclusions\n\n* Sugaring has allowed me to **spend less (relatively) to get more** of the outcomes I want. These intimate relationships with women that were previously unattainable (to me) is worth spending more (vs. going to the gym more or doing all the other dumb, flashy, things guys do to get women).\n* Sugaring has **greatly improved my confidence and emotional health**. Not because I care at all whether an SB likes me for my money or not. Its more a confidence from know I know how to get what I want and really could care less about anything else. I'll take care of myself and whoever's by my side.\n* Most importantly, sugaring has led to couple of **beautiful long term relationships** where I've considered proposing to my SBs (who tend to be more of a match to me than any of my Vanilla exes).\n* **If anyone is curious as to how the data were collected**, since I started dating I have always kept photos and videos of all the SBs I meet in a secured part of Google Photos. Each SB gets their own album with either their real name or fake name (if I never got the real). There I keep all photos and videos of us together or anything they send me. If I never move past the first date with, I usually just delete them unless I had a particular attraction to them. This means the number of POTs is an estimate while the number of SBs is the actual number of albums I have (if it goes to date two I keep everything in their respective folder). For how much sugar for the SB, I just went off memory knowing my standards. For how much is spent per date, I used receipts from the past couple of weeks that I still have. As meticulous as I am, I may have forgotten about one or two girls from the early years of SDing.",

Either I didn\u2019t wait long enough or they ghosted after 1, 2, or 3 (second date is always sugar with me, 1st is never).\n\nResults of waiting to date 5 happened twice. Paid off once and didn\u2019t pay off a second time.\n\nThe first one kept stalling, putting it off, being on her period or canceling. So it was really like 10 New York dates, 5 of which I ended up eating by myself.  Still, I held the line and sugared my way through the storm. She was a girl I had to be with. I finally \u2018got it in\u2019 and it was **glorious**. It was like when Frodo first got the ring! I tried to meet with her again and she flaked so I ended it.\n\nThe second girl was years later and more recent. This time I didn\u2019t \u2018get the ring\u2019. I couldn\u2019t. After a great night out drinking she came back to my hotel room and crashed in my bed but was too drunk. We slept together, naked, but I couldn\u2019t in good faith do anything to her. It was the longest night of my life fighting **blue balls**. She was really out of it. She broke it off after (new boyfriend) but was appreciative because a different guy might have had his way. Not worth it.\n\nWith those last two girls. I really enjoyed their company and would have kept it going. However all the tension around sex is for Vanilla. I\u2019m not issuing my money to get treated like that if I can avoid it",

The only PDA is ever initiated by the SB.\n\nBut when I say rinsers/scammers I mean girls who just show up when they realize 'I'm real' and that's the only way they are getting gouda from me. Two different times girls took off with my wallet (or extra money) after had already took them on dates, given them gouda and didn't push anything.\n\nA third I shared a hotel room with on a trip to South Beach and she came up with an elaborate lie about someone breaking into our hotel room and stealing money from me. I had her back and told the hotel staff her story. They reviewed the security tapes and told me that they knew what happened. They called the cops on HER. She bolted before they got there. I didn't care. I was going to give her the gouda anyway. I was just disappointed.\n\nOne showed up to one date, then had me send her sugar an hour before the second date. When she got it, she then made excuses about traffic and other stuff. She kept me waiting three hours before telling me she couldn't make it. I was so pissed. Unfortunately for her, she used a digital service that reverses charges. I complained to them and had my gouda back in three days.\n\nThe last showed up for three dates after having many discussions about what my expectations are. We had three dates full of laughter and great memories. After date three on her way from dinner to my house she ghosted mid ride (separate cars). She called the next morning (presumably to apologize) but I didn't answer and ended it there.",

Perhaps I could have worded it better. I understand the confusion.",

I\u2019m curious, how do you think most women would rank your appearance? Do you feel that your attractiveness (or lack of) contributed to the allowances and number of 1st dates that didn\u2019t progress to a second date?\n\nAlso, would you say you make and average or above average income compared to other SDs in your primary locations?\n\nLastly, would you say that you flash your wealth during the first few dates (expensive car, home, designer clothing, luxury restaurants, etc?) or are you more of the undercover millionaire type?",

You\u2019re straightforward about the allowance on message 2?\n\nI avoid talking money on the app. I would just tell her that 'it's dating, dinners, and fun/shopping/travel' in exchange for a 'mutually beneficial arrangement'. Then I invite her to text me.\n\nIf pressed to tell her I remove all dollar signs and just write stuff like 'couple grand' 'three thou' etc. That's to try to avoid Seeking's text crawlers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Do you offer more depending on hotness or do you have a standard across the board?\n\nI might. I try to push off getting into specifics until I see her for myself. Pictures can be old. There are girls who I was 'meh' on but showed up and were stunning and, more often, others that were hot 5 years go but have gained weight or aged.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Maybe being vague about Goudas is where I\u2019m failing.  It leads to the awful negotiations.\n\nBe vague but specific. 'a few hundred' 'a few thou' 'a few grand a month' and let her know you can be more specific at dinner or on text.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I\u2019m pretty great at text game in general, but on SA I\u2019m mostly just being straightforward about what I\u2019m looking for in my opener as I\u2019m mostly on there to save time.\n\nDirect and straight forward is good. Just don't bring up sex directly. Instead say stuff like 'normal dating' or 'mutually beneficial'",

However her divorce, even with the money she got from her millionaire wallstreet ex-husband, had set her back. She ended up only being a POT. We had sex a few times but never matured into anything. She was what I would call an \u2018over-extended\u2019 millionaire. Meaning she made a lot and probably had a lot of savings but was burning through it all living as if she still had two incomes.

Before she can ask for 1st date money, use this message to say something like \u2018chemistry is really important to me so it\u2019s important that the first date has no expectations on either side\u2019. \n\nThis preempts the ask for money to show up or get her baby sitter or whatever \n\nMessage 3 - respond to whatever she says but invite her to move to text message to discuss details and talk specific numbers.\n\nI\u2019m usually completely of Seeking and on text very quick.\n\nText is better because you can talk money/intimacy without getting banned. And you can learn more about them (number search, ask for photos that aren\u2019t on SA etc)\n\nI usually do this off an on for about two weeks to \u2018fill my pipeline\u2019 then I spend the next two months dating.

I didn't adjust for ones that last more than that.\n* including all the ones that didn't want money\n* including all rinsers who made it to date no 2\n* including girls who set their own allowance at below 1k gouda\n\nTypical goulda per girl, per date (just sugar, not date itself) is closer to 1.5K gouda (which is explained somewhere in the post).

After a great night out drinking she came back to my hotel room and crashed in my bed but was too drunk. We slept together, naked, but I couldn\u2019t in good faith do anything to her. It was the longest night of my life fighting **blue balls**. She was really out of it. She broke it off after (new boyfriend) but was appreciative because a different guy might have had his way.

I had her back and told the hotel staff her story. They reviewed the security tapes and told me that they knew what happened. They called the cops on HER. She bolted before they got there. I didn't care. I was going to give her the gouda anyway. I was just disappointed.\n\nOne showed up to one date, then had me send her sugar an hour before the second date. When she got it, she then made excuses about traffic and other stuff. She kept me waiting three hours before telling me she couldn't make it. I was so pissed. Unfortunately for her, she used a digital service that reverses charges. I complained to them and had my gouda back in three days.\n\nThe last showed up for three dates after having many discussions about what my expectations are.

Sugaring in your 30 and 40\u2019s is going to be way different than sugaring in your mid 50 and 60\u2019s. The relationships are going to be more transactional, because the girls will have to compromise on attraction more than they are with you now, and a lot of the arrangements will feel closer to escort sessions than what you experience now.\n\nThe quality of the bowl will probably continue to get worse for everybody, there is already a huge decline in quality for all SD compared to 5 yrs ago, because of improvement in the economy, and this is not counting the fact that SA may get shut down by the feds, and sugaring overseas will become more difficult as those countries continue develop and there\u2019s more economic opportunity for woman.\n\nI\u2019m not telling you what do, but the cost benefit of sugaring will change over time.",

I was wondering if SBs tracked stuff like this.\n\nI think only two or three:\n\nOne was a pretty successful realtor, working for a firm (but she didn\u2019t own it). She was mid-twenties and was more SBing to meet \u2018up scale\u2019 men. She was a 10 and our SR lasted about three years.\n\nOne was in her 40s, was in finance and had been married. However her divorce, even with the money she got from her millionaire wallstreet ex-husband, had set her back. She ended up only being a POT. We had sex a few times but never matured into anything. She was what I would call an \u2018over-extended\u2019 millionaire. Meaning she made a lot and probably had a lot of savings but was burning through it all living as if she still had two incomes. Also their legal battle in the divorce was very expensive",

I had her back and told the hotel staff her story. They reviewed the security tapes and told me that they knew what happened. They called the cops on HER. She bolted before they got there. I didn't care. I was going to give her the gouda anyway. I was just disappointed.\n\nOne showed up to one date, then had me send her sugar an hour before the second date. When she got it, she then made excuses about traffic and other stuff. She kept me waiting three hours before telling me she couldn't make it. I was so pissed. Unfortunately for her, she used a digital service that reverses charges. I complained to them and had my gouda back in three days.\n\nThe last showed up for three dates after having many discussions about what my expectations are. We had three dates full of laughter and great memories. After date three on her way from dinner to my house she ghosted mid ride (separate cars).

The relationships are going to be more transactional, because the girls will have to compromise on attraction more than they are with you now, and a lot of the arrangements will feel closer to escort sessions than what you experience now.\n\nThe quality of the bowl will probably continue to get worse for everybody, there is already a huge decline in quality for all SD compared to 5 yrs ago, because of improvement in the economy, and this is not counting the fact that SA may get shut down by the feds, and sugaring overseas will become more difficult as those countries continue develop and there\u2019s more economic opportunity for woman.\n\nI\u2019m not telling you what do, but the cost benefit of sugaring will change over time.",

I was wondering if SBs tracked stuff like this.\n\nI think only two or three:\n\nOne was a pretty successful realtor, working for a firm (but she didn\u2019t own it). She was mid-twenties and was more SBing to meet \u2018up scale\u2019 men. She was a 10 and our SR lasted about three years.\n\nOne was in her 40s, was in finance and had been married. However her divorce, even with the money she got from her millionaire wallstreet ex-husband, had set her back. She ended up only being a POT. We had sex a few times but never matured into anything. She was what I would call an \u2018over-extended\u2019 millionaire. Meaning she made a lot and probably had a lot of savings but was burning through it all living as if she still had two incomes. Also their legal battle in the divorce was very expensive",

Two different times girls took off with my wallet (or extra money) after had already took them on dates, given them gouda and didn't push anything.\n\nA third I shared a hotel room with on a trip to South Beach and she came up with an elaborate lie about someone breaking into our hotel room and stealing money from me. I had her back and told the hotel staff her story. They reviewed the security tapes and told me that they knew what happened. They called the cops on HER. She bolted before they got there. I didn't care. I was going to give her the gouda anyway. I was just disappointed.\n\nOne showed up to one date, then had me send her sugar an hour before the second date. When she got it, she then made excuses about traffic and other stuff. She kept me waiting three hours before telling me she couldn't make it. I was so pissed. Unfortunately for her, she used a digital service that reverses charges. I complained to them and had my gouda back in three days.\n\nThe last showed up for three dates after having many discussions about what my expectations are. We had three dates full of laughter and great memories. After date three on her way from dinner to my house she ghosted mid ride (separate cars). She called the next morning (presumably to apologize) but I didn't answer and ended it there.",
