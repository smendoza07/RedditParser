    "body": "(I\u2019m using my throwaway because this is embarrassing)\n\nTLDR: SD is awful at sex/possibly suffering from erectile dysfunction and is odd in general. He gives a generous ppm though. How do I help him/should I just leave?\n\nI (19f) have a new SD (53ish m), I find him strange and sometimes annoying but feel guilty as he gives me a generous ppm and has no problem compensating me for platonic lunches. \n\nDuring the dinner before our first intimate date last week, he held my hand all through my starter. He also commented on my dress and sort of grabbed my side/waist numerous times when I was sitting down (I asked him to stop \u201cgrabbing me\u201d to which he replied \u201chaha, this isn\u2019t grabbing you! Grabbing would be like\u2026\u201d). He said I\u2019m like a \u201cprincess\u201d and has previously called me \u201cfeisty\u201d. \n\nHe usually sends constant text messages throughout the day and our first intimate date was just\u2026odd. He\u2019s bad at kissing, spanked me lightly for ages (which is fine), and then tried to \u2018eat me out\u2019. He spent ages licking and blowing (??) on the top and bottom of my vag, completely missing the important part and at one point was just shallowly fingering me whilst moaning. I was tipsy and had to stop myself from laughing audibly. I couldn\u2019t believe it or even get wet as it felt almost clinical. \n\nWhen he finally stopped, he got up and I went to feel his privates and he was soft and tiny. He took of his underwear and it was minuscule! He told me \u201cit\u2019s okay!\u201d and asked me to suck his balls, which I declined. I played with them and while he did get hard and grow a little, it\u2019s was still very small. In comparison, his balls were massive and seemed to be one (idk if that\u2019s normal). Every time he tried to move or enter me, he would lose his erection and blamed it on \u2018having difficulty finding my hole\u2019.\n\nI ended up just giving him a handjob and he came almost silently in the condom. It was strange and I believe that he is suffering from erectile dysfunction. He blames \u2018issues at work which are bothering him\u2019. I have suggested viagra and he pretended to not know what it was. \n\nLater, he sent me a text saying \u201cYou are very lovely - I enjoyed our time together - and thanks for being patient. I was a bit distracted and them embarrassed. Hope you didn\u2019t mind?\u201d \n\nI\u2019m unsure of what to do, the ppm is generous and he seems sweet but is totally oblivious of how awful the intimacy is. How do I help him? Should I leave?",

It was after my divorce and I finally met someone that knew what they liked, how to tell/show me what they liked and most importantly she made me feel desired is what made it great. \n\nShe desired me, and back then it was for my looks over my $, but she made the effort to guide & teach me how to please her. So if you desire something about this guy ($) then I propose that you try to guide him too.  \n\n\nP.S.  \nI would have suggested you next this guy if just based on the non-sex scenarios you mentioned (hand holding and ass grabbing).",

It is important that we\u2019re satisfied, bring a vibrator along or do something to SHOW him how you like it. You have to take some initiative here. He probably was really nervous too so I think giving yourselves some time to get more comfortable and acquainted with one another could be beneficial. You said he gives you a generous ppm and even pays for platonic dates so he does sound like a quality sd, even if he isn\u2019t a quality lover. Keep seeing him IMO and meet some other sd\u2019s.

When he goes down on you, ask him to do specific things you like.  \n\nBut it was probably just nerves, as it was first intimate date.  As long as everything is great with him otherwise, the sex can be learned (well, except size).",

It\u2019s not a knock on you or women in general, but most daddies probably have 30-40 years worth of friends keep in touch with, not to mention maybe spouses and offspring. \n\nI would caution against trying to improve his sex unless you\u2019re in it for the long haul. Imagine going though life as a guy with a small penis. You always disappoint women and never get to please them. You have no confidence so it\u2019s hard to perform. Now along comes a woman who teaches you how to please her. You\u2019re probably gonna latch on to her for dear life. You\u2019ll effectively be the girl he lost his virginity to. It will be the best sex he\u2019s ever had and you will be forever special to him. \n\nImagine how attached he\u2019s likely to become, like a teenager with his first girlfriend.  I doubt you want to be that important to him. I\u2019d worry about ending up with a stalker or worse.  \n\nIf you\u2019re gonna keep things status quo, put up a mental barrier and keep giving him hand jobs for cash, it probably won\u2019t last much longer anyways.

But yeah, let's blame OP for his shitty performance and behavior! \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude12\n\nCan't kiss.\nDoesn't know how to eat pussy or where the clit resides.\nCan't get and stay hard.\nCan't find her \"hole\"????????\n\nHe needs more than communication.\nHe sounds like he needs a damn miracle.\n\nNow, I don't disagree that communication is an essential part of good sex. I've been having sex long enough that I know this is very true. \n\nHowever, for OP.... No. Just NO. Ain't no way at 19, was I gonna willingly teach some old man all of that. He's giving her nothing to work with other than \"eager to please.\" It's one thing for someone to have a technique and I tell him things to tweak what he's doing to please me, specifically, better-- ie: stop sucking my clit so hard. Easy fix. But for this man to not even know where the clit is on top of everything else? That's too clueless for me to try to help.\n\nAnd even then, the way he so easily dismissed her telling him to stop groping her, he likely wouldn't even listen to her trying to teach his creepy self how to please her and perform better.",

The first one actually was super aggressive and I didn\u2019t want to have sex with him, not because of his limp dick but because of his actions. Then afterwards he tried to blame me for his dick issue so yeh just no. You say she\u2019s lacking compassion but when you are put in a situation like this it\u2019s completely uncomfortable. Come on, men know when they have this issue and need to man up and go get viagra.\n\nNow for the second guy he was diabetic also, he was 43 yrs old and the other guy was 44. With this guy he was not at all rude and didn\u2019t make me feel uncomfortable but he didn\u2019t want to face the fact that his dick didn\u2019t work. I met him on a SD site and he didn\u2019t even offer to take me out or anything that a sugar daddy stands for. I told him that he may need to get viagra in a nice way without trying to hurt his feelings and he simply said he didn\u2019t want to go to the Drs.\n\nMy question is why In the world would you wipe out a limp dick knowing it doesn\u2019t work and basically embarrass yourself and disappoint the other person. Seems like a lack of compassion there and pretty selfish.\n\nNeedless to say I\u2019m going younger and currently talking to a 30 yr old, no one has time for messy dick issues especially when men want to act like it isn\u2019t an issue!! I call it phantom dick!!!",

I guess the question to ask (and I say this from an SD perspective, not an SB) is what is the motivation for you sugaring, better sex, or the $? I'm not saying it cannot be both. Sex at the level you are speaking of is not enjoyable, I completely get that. As a sensual dominant, it is a point of pride with me that any SB with me enjoys the experience far more than it is possible for me to, being a male and obviously with limited orgasm potential. Were I to give one such an experience, I would want to hide under a rock. I can say a few things based on your description, however. If indeed his does only have one testicle, and there is not obvious scarring(like in war or an accident), it is very possible he suffered from testicular cancer at some point in his life. I think you analysis that he might have ED is very correct. Some suggested corrective methods for it are the gainswave treatment, ED medications, or also testosterone supplementation(losing a testicle can effect testosterone), perhaps he might take advice from you on one of those. I suggest you tell him this, \"I am still willing to see you, but I want to give you instruction on what pleases a woman, and I want you to follow it. If you do, every woman you ever have in your life will thank me.\" If he responds in the negative, then you must accept that things are never going to change, and I'm sure there are more pleasing Daddies out there you could be with.",

I've been having sex long enough that I know this is very true. \n\nHowever, for OP.... No. Just NO. Ain't no way at 19, was I gonna willingly teach some old man all of that. He's giving her nothing to work with other than \"eager to please.\" It's one thing for someone to have a technique and I tell him things to tweak what he's doing to please me, specifically, better-- ie: stop sucking my clit so hard. Easy fix. But for this man to not even know where the clit is on top of everything else? That's too clueless for me to try to help.\n\nAnd even then, the way he so easily dismissed her telling him to stop groping her, he likely wouldn't even listen to her trying to teach his creepy self how to please her and perform better.",

Many SDs have ended things with many SBs for less. Turnabout is fair play.\n\nThe one thing I will say is that I always try not to judge a partner just on the first time we are together - sometimes nerves etc get in the way - so it may be that if she bosses him around and tells him just what to do the second time could be better.

The first one actually was super aggressive and I didn\u2019t want to have sex with him, not because of his limp dick but because of his actions. Then afterwards he tried to blame me for his dick issue so yeh just no. You say she\u2019s lacking compassion but when you are put in a situation like this it\u2019s completely uncomfortable. Come on, men know when they have this issue and need to man up and go get viagra.\n\nNow for the second guy he was diabetic also, he was 43 yrs old and the other guy was 44. With this guy he was not at all rude and didn\u2019t make me feel uncomfortable but he didn\u2019t want to face the fact that his dick didn\u2019t work. I met him on a SD site and he didn\u2019t even offer to take me out or anything that a sugar daddy stands for. I told him that he may need to get viagra in a nice way without trying to hurt his feelings and he simply said he didn\u2019t want to go to the Drs.\n\nMy question is why In the world would you wipe out a limp dick knowing it doesn\u2019t work and basically embarrass yourself and disappoint the other person. Seems like a lack of compassion there and pretty selfish.\n\nNeedless to say I\u2019m going younger and currently talking to a 30 yr old, no one has time for messy dick issues especially when men want to act like it isn\u2019t an issue!! I call it phantom dick!!!",

He's giving her nothing to work with other than \"eager to please.\" It's one thing for someone to have a technique and I tell him things to tweak what he's doing to please me, specifically, better-- ie: stop sucking my clit so hard. Easy fix. But for this man to not even know where the clit is on top of everything else? That's too clueless for me to try to help.\n\nAnd even then, the way he so easily dismissed her telling him to stop groping her, he likely wouldn't even listen to her trying to teach his creepy self how to please her and perform better.",

I've been having sex long enough that I know this is very true. \n\nHowever, for OP.... No. Just NO. Ain't no way at 19, was I gonna willingly teach some old man all of that. He's giving her nothing to work with other than \"eager to please.\" It's one thing for someone to have a technique and I tell him things to tweak what he's doing to please me, specifically, better-- ie: stop sucking my clit so hard. Easy fix. But for this man to not even know where the clit is on top of everything else? That's too clueless for me to try to help.\n\nAnd even then, the way he so easily dismissed her telling him to stop groping her, he likely wouldn't even listen to her trying to teach his creepy self how to please her and perform better.",
