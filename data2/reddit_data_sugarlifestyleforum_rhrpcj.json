    "body": "EDIT: First of all a MASSIVE thank you for all the really lovely comments, the advice, the DMS asking how I am etc.. I know some days our little SLF family can seem a little dysfunctional but yesterday when I felt sick with stress this community really helped me ( also mince pies helped...so many mince pies) \n\nOh..to the commenter who suggested that I need to get over myself and was over reacting to Covid.. Are your parents cousins? Perhaps even brother and sister? As it's the only explanation I have for your stupidity.\n\nAs of 10pm last night I'm still negative so it's looking like I've been lucky, I will keep testing every day until my flight.\n\nSD sent messages and voice tags asking for my test results, I have responded that I'm negative but have asked him to give me some space until after Christmas and we will chat then, the relationship is over but I want our final conversation to come at a time when I'm less hurt and angry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn Tuesday my SD ( of 14 months) booked the beautiful Corinthia Hotel London to celebrate our Christmas date. Our plan was to order room service, drink champagne, watch ''It's a wonderful life'' and unwrap our Christmas presents, the reality however was a sleepless night which I am 99.9% sure has ended our SR.When I arrived he was already in our room and I noticed immediately that he wasn't looking well, he was pale and coughing..badly..Before I had even taken my coat off I asked him if he was feeling alright, if he wanted me to go home and to reschedule, I would have completely understood. He assured me that..A. He just had a cough he'd picked up from his daughters schoolB. He'd taken 2 lateral flow tests and was showing negativeC. He felt fine..it was just a cough.\n\nWe settled into the room, I ordered room service, some champagne for me and a hot whiskey for him..I ran him a hot bath and also asked the wonderful hotel team so send up some ginger herbal tea for later, we tried to enjoy our night but by 10pm he was a lot worse, he was coughing like a small alien being was tying to escape his chest..everytime he tired to lay down the coughing was worse.He told me if I wanted to leave or to get another room he's completely understand and he kept apologising for ''ruining our Christmas'.Of course I stayed, this was a man I have been in an intimate relationship for more than a year, a man who has supported me, treated me with nothing but kindness and respect..why wouldn't I stay and take care of him? After all it was just a cough his daughter brought home from school..\n\nSo I stayed up all night with him, I made tea, rubbed his back, got him water and even used an online 24 hour pharmacy to order cough medicine to the hotel.At 4 am he became very emotional and again kept telling me how sorry he was..how he was a ''selfish idiot'' finally he admitting to me that he hadn't in fact taken any lateral flow tests and that he'd been feeling sick since a party he'd attended on Saturday night, that he'd ''chosen ignorance so we could still have our date''\n\nI just sat there feeling numb and sick and exhausted, he knew I was flying back to Ireland this weekend to see my family for Christmas, that I haven't been home for 2 years and that I need an negative PCR test to board my flight. He knew it would devastate me to spend Christmas alone again this year. I have lateral flowed everyday for the past 2 weeks and have not stepped foot outside my door without my mask.\n\nI silently packed up and ordered my own Uber home, he kept saying sorry but I just left..He messaged me yesterday to say he's tested Positive ( of course he has)  and he's incredibly sorry.I have not responded yet.I tested negative last night and will test again today as I realise it can take a few days to show up.I am sick with worry, feel so sad and hurt he could have done this and have no idea how to even approach a conversation with him. I don't feel I can ghost after a year long relationship..I feel a conversation is needed but perhaps I should wait until after Christmas.",

If he survives...and the odds are high if he was vaccinated...then why wouldnt you continue the relationship? \n\nFinding an SD who is financially capable and willing to go long term is tough. A lot tougher than forgiving a moment of selfishness. \n\nPersonally as a guy who had covid almost two years ago now, I have never worried about it since. Surviving a bad encounter with it when there was no vaccine and the entire medical advice amounted to stay home and take sudafed until you are almost dead then come to the hospital where we will kill you.....means There isnt much left to worry about unless there is a deadly mutation that my immune system cannot recognize or I develop a more serious comorbidity than being middle aged and somewhat fat. \n\nI understand it's a big deal when there are rules that effect your travel etc....but Where I live we have few mandatory rules left....and the ones that remain no one pays attention to unless it's getting a test to see a concert. Im financially capable of avoiding any business or agency that wants to boss me around. So take my comment in context. \n\nThe SD crowd of older men are at the highest risk for death from covid of anyone. And that realization can make them make poor choices. \n\nIt's Christmas, maybe forgive and forget.",

Hopefully for OP\u2019s sake he was double vaxxed and it just hit him hard. \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth (OP, if you see this) my friend was with me the entire time I could\u2019ve caught my case of Covid - I even sneezed around him a TON when my symptoms first started - and he never got any symptoms or tested positive. It is possible that you\u2019ll test negative and remain Covid-free despite being in close quarters! Fingers crossed!",

Naturally thats an obscene imposition on anyones life so it's necessary....when your government limits your rights based on covid....to take extreme or obscene measures to avoid exposure.\n\n(as an aside I can recommend all sorts of industrial grade respirators that would make you nearly immune to Covid exposure in the wild, but who wants to wear a Storm Trooper mask all day long if they arent working with dangerous materials?)\n\nMy point is only that finding an SD who is genuine and can afford to keep you in luxury is hard enough....if you start applying political and pandemic filters to the relationship...you are back to shopping in an ever shrinking market. Maybe you forgive and forget?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, sorry for the delay in answering, I dont use this acct often.",
