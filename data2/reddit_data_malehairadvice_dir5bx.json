Dyeing your hair will brighten your face up in a sense. So yes, your spot will be a bit more noticeable, but your entire face will also looks brighter & you will be way cooler. I thought the new hair color actually freshened me up & helps distract people away from my scars. \n\nWon't hurt to try, you can always dye it back to black in a few weeks if you hate it and if your hair is healthy enough.

If you\u2019re used to washing your hair frequently or even running water on it in the morning/evening, you will have to find an alternative like dry shampoo or something else. You can\u2019t shampoo your hair frequently, and you\u2019ll have to use a purple shampoo to keep the hair color in such a vibrant state. You\u2019ll also have to get root touch ups every month at a minimum to keep the color, and in the event that you want to revert to your original hair color, you\u2019ll have to shill out additional costs\u2014perhaps close to the amount you paid to get your hair bleached. The reason most idols tend to get their hair colored is because they don\u2019t have to do it themselves; they have trained professionals whose main job is to style their hair. \n\nAdditionally, Mingyu in the middle picture there does have makeup on. If you find a picture of him without makeup and unstyled hair, (he doesn\u2019t look bad by any means) he just doesn\u2019t look as \u201coh wow\u201d as the photo.\n\nI also mean this nicely, but his skin is a bit fairer than yours, and if you do choose to get the grey, I would go for a darker grey as opposed to a vibrant white-ish one like his. \n\nIf this all sounds worthwhile, then that\u2019s awesome! I just wanted to explain everything before you fully commit. :)",

So yes, your spot will be a bit more noticeable, but your entire face will also looks brighter & you will be way cooler. I thought the new hair color actually freshened me up & helps distract people away from my scars. \n\nWon't hurt to try, you can always dye it back to black in a few weeks if you hate it and if your hair is healthy enough. Good luck!",
