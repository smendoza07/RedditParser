But if Jiraiya taught Naruto how to escape, it is plausible that Minato would\u2019ve been taught it too. And I don\u2019t believe Obito\u2019s Genjutsu Skills weren\u2019t as developed yet. It is theorized that the Konoha Nine Tails attack occurred while Kakashi and Obito were 15 or 16, but it is shown in a filler that Yagura was in a genjutsu years later when Kisame Hoshigaki was being recruited to the Akatsuki. This is 7 or 8 years down the line because Itachi was also in the Akatsuki at this time. Even if Minato got in a genjutsu, I believe the Genjutsu wouldn\u2019t be that powerful. Something I forgot to mention is, by the time Minato was Hokage, he probably had lots of training against Genjutsu, as he was Fugaku\u2019s(Sasuke\u2019s Dad) rival. Fugaku was shown to have a very powerful Mangekyo power (genjutsu wise), as stated to be able to control the Nine Tailed Fox. It is hard to believe that Obito would\u2019ve won even if he had good genjutsu.",

Intelligence comes first, to have a strategy during a fight, they are shinobis, they don't tank their way out of a fight. Minato and Itachi are not comparable to Naruto and Sasuke in any way. Their fields of expertise are different in the first place. Itachi's strong suit is genjutsu, and the rest of them are all around. So, if there ever came a fight between Itachi and Minato, the worse that could happen is they fight for long. Itachi slapping Minato is just a dream that you are having because he turned out to be the hero of Leaf village and died and killed his own people and never got recognised and that's sad. And I want him to slap Danzo around real bad. But don't let your feelings cloud the strengths and skills that each character has.",

But if Jiraiya taught Naruto how to escape, it is plausible that Minato would\u2019ve been taught it too. And I don\u2019t believe Obito\u2019s Genjutsu Skills weren\u2019t as developed yet. It is theorized that the Konoha Nine Tails attack occurred while Kakashi and Obito were 15 or 16, but it is shown in a filler that Yagura was in a genjutsu years later when Kisame Hoshigaki was being recruited to the Akatsuki. This is 7 or 8 years down the line because Itachi was also in the Akatsuki at this time. Even if Minato got in a genjutsu, I believe the Genjutsu wouldn\u2019t be that powerful. Something I forgot to mention is, by the time Minato was Hokage, he probably had lots of training against Genjutsu, as he was Fugaku\u2019s(Sasuke\u2019s Dad) rival. Fugaku was shown to have a very powerful Mangekyo power (genjutsu wise), as stated to be able to control the Nine Tailed Fox. It is hard to believe that Obito would\u2019ve won even if he had good genjutsu.",

Intelligence comes first, to have a strategy during a fight, they are shinobis, they don't tank their way out of a fight. Minato and Itachi are not comparable to Naruto and Sasuke in any way. Their fields of expertise are different in the first place. Itachi's strong suit is genjutsu, and the rest of them are all around. So, if there ever came a fight between Itachi and Minato, the worse that could happen is they fight for long. Itachi slapping Minato is just a dream that you are having because he turned out to be the hero of Leaf village and died and killed his own people and never got recognised and that's sad. And I want him to slap Danzo around real bad. But don't let your feelings cloud the strengths and skills that each character has.",

It is theorized that the Konoha Nine Tails attack occurred while Kakashi and Obito were 15 or 16, but it is shown in a filler that Yagura was in a genjutsu years later when Kisame Hoshigaki was being recruited to the Akatsuki. This is 7 or 8 years down the line because Itachi was also in the Akatsuki at this time. Even if Minato got in a genjutsu, I believe the Genjutsu wouldn\u2019t be that powerful. Something I forgot to mention is, by the time Minato was Hokage, he probably had lots of training against Genjutsu, as he was Fugaku\u2019s(Sasuke\u2019s Dad) rival. Fugaku was shown to have a very powerful Mangekyo power (genjutsu wise), as stated to be able to control the Nine Tailed Fox. It is hard to believe that Obito would\u2019ve won even if he had good genjutsu.",

Intelligence comes first, to have a strategy during a fight, they are shinobis, they don't tank their way out of a fight. Minato and Itachi are not comparable to Naruto and Sasuke in any way. Their fields of expertise are different in the first place. Itachi's strong suit is genjutsu, and the rest of them are all around. So, if there ever came a fight between Itachi and Minato, the worse that could happen is they fight for long. Itachi slapping Minato is just a dream that you are having because he turned out to be the hero of Leaf village and died and killed his own people and never got recognised and that's sad. And I want him to slap Danzo around real bad. But don't let your feelings cloud the strengths and skills that each character has.",

But if Jiraiya taught Naruto how to escape, it is plausible that Minato would\u2019ve been taught it too. And I don\u2019t believe Obito\u2019s Genjutsu Skills weren\u2019t as developed yet. It is theorized that the Konoha Nine Tails attack occurred while Kakashi and Obito were 15 or 16, but it is shown in a filler that Yagura was in a genjutsu years later when Kisame Hoshigaki was being recruited to the Akatsuki. This is 7 or 8 years down the line because Itachi was also in the Akatsuki at this time. Even if Minato got in a genjutsu, I believe the Genjutsu wouldn\u2019t be that powerful. Something I forgot to mention is, by the time Minato was Hokage, he probably had lots of training against Genjutsu, as he was Fugaku\u2019s(Sasuke\u2019s Dad) rival. Fugaku was shown to have a very powerful Mangekyo power (genjutsu wise), as stated to be able to control the Nine Tailed Fox. It is hard to believe that Obito would\u2019ve won even if he had good genjutsu.",

Their fields of expertise are different in the first place. Itachi's strong suit is genjutsu, and the rest of them are all around. So, if there ever came a fight between Itachi and Minato, the worse that could happen is they fight for long. Itachi slapping Minato is just a dream that you are having because he turned out to be the hero of Leaf village and died and killed his own people and never got recognised and that's sad. And I want him to slap Danzo around real bad. But don't let your feelings cloud the strengths and skills that each character has.",

But if Jiraiya taught Naruto how to escape, it is plausible that Minato would\u2019ve been taught it too. And I don\u2019t believe Obito\u2019s Genjutsu Skills weren\u2019t as developed yet. It is theorized that the Konoha Nine Tails attack occurred while Kakashi and Obito were 15 or 16, but it is shown in a filler that Yagura was in a genjutsu years later when Kisame Hoshigaki was being recruited to the Akatsuki. This is 7 or 8 years down the line because Itachi was also in the Akatsuki at this time. Even if Minato got in a genjutsu, I believe the Genjutsu wouldn\u2019t be that powerful. Something I forgot to mention is, by the time Minato was Hokage, he probably had lots of training against Genjutsu, as he was Fugaku\u2019s(Sasuke\u2019s Dad) rival. Fugaku was shown to have a very powerful Mangekyo power (genjutsu wise), as stated to be able to control the Nine Tailed Fox. It is hard to believe that Obito would\u2019ve won even if he had good genjutsu.",

Intelligence comes first, to have a strategy during a fight, they are shinobis, they don't tank their way out of a fight. Minato and Itachi are not comparable to Naruto and Sasuke in any way. Their fields of expertise are different in the first place. Itachi's strong suit is genjutsu, and the rest of them are all around. So, if there ever came a fight between Itachi and Minato, the worse that could happen is they fight for long. Itachi slapping Minato is just a dream that you are having because he turned out to be the hero of Leaf village and died and killed his own people and never got recognised and that's sad. And I want him to slap Danzo around real bad. But don't let your feelings cloud the strengths and skills that each character has.",

It is theorized that the Konoha Nine Tails attack occurred while Kakashi and Obito were 15 or 16, but it is shown in a filler that Yagura was in a genjutsu years later when Kisame Hoshigaki was being recruited to the Akatsuki. This is 7 or 8 years down the line because Itachi was also in the Akatsuki at this time. Even if Minato got in a genjutsu, I believe the Genjutsu wouldn\u2019t be that powerful. Something I forgot to mention is, by the time Minato was Hokage, he probably had lots of training against Genjutsu, as he was Fugaku\u2019s(Sasuke\u2019s Dad) rival. Fugaku was shown to have a very powerful Mangekyo power (genjutsu wise), as stated to be able to control the Nine Tailed Fox. It is hard to believe that Obito would\u2019ve won even if he had good genjutsu.",

Their fields of expertise are different in the first place. Itachi's strong suit is genjutsu, and the rest of them are all around. So, if there ever came a fight between Itachi and Minato, the worse that could happen is they fight for long. Itachi slapping Minato is just a dream that you are having because he turned out to be the hero of Leaf village and died and killed his own people and never got recognised and that's sad. And I want him to slap Danzo around real bad. But don't let your feelings cloud the strengths and skills that each character has.",

But if Jiraiya taught Naruto how to escape, it is plausible that Minato would\u2019ve been taught it too. And I don\u2019t believe Obito\u2019s Genjutsu Skills weren\u2019t as developed yet. It is theorized that the Konoha Nine Tails attack occurred while Kakashi and Obito were 15 or 16, but it is shown in a filler that Yagura was in a genjutsu years later when Kisame Hoshigaki was being recruited to the Akatsuki. This is 7 or 8 years down the line because Itachi was also in the Akatsuki at this time. Even if Minato got in a genjutsu, I believe the Genjutsu wouldn\u2019t be that powerful. Something I forgot to mention is, by the time Minato was Hokage, he probably had lots of training against Genjutsu, as he was Fugaku\u2019s(Sasuke\u2019s Dad) rival. Fugaku was shown to have a very powerful Mangekyo power (genjutsu wise), as stated to be able to control the Nine Tailed Fox. It is hard to believe that Obito would\u2019ve won even if he had good genjutsu.",

It just comes down to your own opinion as there are too many plot holes for an accurate conclusion to be made.",

Their fields of expertise are different in the first place. Itachi's strong suit is genjutsu, and the rest of them are all around. So, if there ever came a fight between Itachi and Minato, the worse that could happen is they fight for long. Itachi slapping Minato is just a dream that you are having because he turned out to be the hero of Leaf village and died and killed his own people and never got recognised and that's sad. And I want him to slap Danzo around real bad. But don't let your feelings cloud the strengths and skills that each character has.",

It is theorized that the Konoha Nine Tails attack occurred while Kakashi and Obito were 15 or 16, but it is shown in a filler that Yagura was in a genjutsu years later when Kisame Hoshigaki was being recruited to the Akatsuki. This is 7 or 8 years down the line because Itachi was also in the Akatsuki at this time. Even if Minato got in a genjutsu, I believe the Genjutsu wouldn\u2019t be that powerful. Something I forgot to mention is, by the time Minato was Hokage, he probably had lots of training against Genjutsu, as he was Fugaku\u2019s(Sasuke\u2019s Dad) rival. Fugaku was shown to have a very powerful Mangekyo power (genjutsu wise), as stated to be able to control the Nine Tailed Fox. It is hard to believe that Obito would\u2019ve won even if he had good genjutsu.",

And I don\u2019t believe Obito\u2019s Genjutsu Skills weren\u2019t as developed yet. It is theorized that the Konoha Nine Tails attack occurred while Kakashi and Obito were 15 or 16, but it is shown in a filler that Yagura was in a genjutsu years later when Kisame Hoshigaki was being recruited to the Akatsuki. This is 7 or 8 years down the line because Itachi was also in the Akatsuki at this time. Even if Minato got in a genjutsu, I believe the Genjutsu wouldn\u2019t be that powerful. Something I forgot to mention is, by the time Minato was Hokage, he probably had lots of training against Genjutsu, as he was Fugaku\u2019s(Sasuke\u2019s Dad) rival. Fugaku was shown to have a very powerful Mangekyo power (genjutsu wise), as stated to be able to control the Nine Tailed Fox. It is hard to believe that Obito would\u2019ve won even if he had good genjutsu.",
