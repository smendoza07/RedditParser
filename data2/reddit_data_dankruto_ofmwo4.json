Has anyone even pointed out his shit rapping before? maybe Naruto but I'm not even sure of that because I don't think it has ever been focused that much. Imo the whole point of Killer Bee's rapping is him being eccentric and savage, like when he wrote lyrics as he was owning the entire Taka team or when he was about to fight Kisame.\n\nIt's also easier for an actual rapper to fake being an amateurish rapper instead of someone with no background in it at all. I'm sure Idris Elba can act comedy if he wants to but he's been typecast as the silent or wise badass for so long it'll just look ridiculous if he starts rapping ala Killer Bee. He can nail the action part for sure but I'm not sure he can quite capture Killer Bee's personality.",

Has anyone even pointed out his shit rapping before? maybe Naruto but I'm not even sure of that because I don't think it has ever been focused that much. Imo the whole point of Killer Bee's rapping is him being eccentric and savage, like when he wrote lyrics as he was owning the entire Taka team or when he was about to fight Kisame.\n\nIt's also easier for an actual rapper to fake being an amateurish rapper instead of someone with no background in it at all. I'm sure Idris Elba can act comedy if he wants to but he's been typecast as the silent or wise badass for so long it'll just look ridiculous if he starts rapping ala Killer Bee. He can nail the action part for sure but I'm not sure he can quite capture Killer Bee's personality.",

Has anyone even pointed out his shit rapping before? maybe Naruto but I'm not even sure of that because I don't think it has ever been focused that much. Imo the whole point of Killer Bee's rapping is him being eccentric and savage, like when he wrote lyrics as he was owning the entire Taka team or when he was about to fight Kisame.\n\nIt's also easier for an actual rapper to fake being an amateurish rapper instead of someone with no background in it at all. I'm sure Idris Elba can act comedy if he wants to but he's been typecast as the silent or wise badass for so long it'll just look ridiculous if he starts rapping ala Killer Bee. He can nail the action part for sure but I'm not sure he can quite capture Killer Bee's personality.",

Has anyone even pointed out his shit rapping before? maybe Naruto but I'm not even sure of that because I don't think it has ever been focused that much. Imo the whole point of Killer Bee's rapping is him being eccentric and savage, like when he wrote lyrics as he was owning the entire Taka team or when he was about to fight Kisame.\n\nIt's also easier for an actual rapper to fake being an amateurish rapper instead of someone with no background in it at all. I'm sure Idris Elba can act comedy if he wants to but he's been typecast as the silent or wise badass for so long it'll just look ridiculous if he starts rapping ala Killer Bee. He can nail the action part for sure but I'm not sure he can quite capture Killer Bee's personality.",

Has anyone even pointed out his shit rapping before? maybe Naruto but I'm not even sure of that because I don't think it has ever been focused that much. Imo the whole point of Killer Bee's rapping is him being eccentric and savage, like when he wrote lyrics as he was owning the entire Taka team or when he was about to fight Kisame.\n\nIt's also easier for an actual rapper to fake being an amateurish rapper instead of someone with no background in it at all. I'm sure Idris Elba can act comedy if he wants to but he's been typecast as the silent or wise badass for so long it'll just look ridiculous if he starts rapping ala Killer Bee. He can nail the action part for sure but I'm not sure he can quite capture Killer Bee's personality.",

Has anyone even pointed out his shit rapping before? maybe Naruto but I'm not even sure of that because I don't think it has ever been focused that much. Imo the whole point of Killer Bee's rapping is him being eccentric and savage, like when he wrote lyrics as he was owning the entire Taka team or when he was about to fight Kisame.\n\nIt's also easier for an actual rapper to fake being an amateurish rapper instead of someone with no background in it at all. I'm sure Idris Elba can act comedy if he wants to but he's been typecast as the silent or wise badass for so long it'll just look ridiculous if he starts rapping ala Killer Bee. He can nail the action part for sure but I'm not sure he can quite capture Killer Bee's personality.",
