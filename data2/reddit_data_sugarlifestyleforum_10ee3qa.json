    "body": "Throw away cus idr the login for my main sugar acct.\n\nTLDR; getting my allowance for 2023 paid in full upfront.\n\nDon't know how I got here, but after going through an earth shaking heartbreak I started sugaring again in August. In October I met my SBF.\nHe's been so kind and caring and sweet, he just gave me a generous allowance every time I came over for PPM, we never discussed any hard details of an arrangement until this past Saturday.\n\nHe recently retired, put most of it away, but budgeted a certain amount for a certain amount of years. He also did not just have my PPM out waiting like it usually was. \nI wanted to try and budget too, so I breached the subject of arrangement details. \n\nHe was a little uncomfortable, and the conversation was definitely uncomfortable, but Jesus christ \nMy SBF decided the best way for us to proceed is if he gives me my allowance upfront for the entire year. \n\nI got the first portion of it on Saturday. \n11x my PPM in hand in one night.\n\nHoly shit \ud83d\ude33 \nI am still finding it hard to believe this is happening. \nIt honestly changes my life already. \nI'm sure this is a wildly ridiculous situation for a SR, and I couldn't find any posts about an upfront yearly allowance, so I had to document that I am receiving my allowance yearly. Most men think the SB would leave, and most SBs probably would.\nI'm not going anywhere. No one has ever cooked for me before and this man has cooked for me from scratch multiple times and remembers my dietary constraints, is a phenomenal mentor, and has a big ol dick that still works!\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4d\n\nIt is possible to receive a yearly allowance, but I sure as SHIT did not ask for it, and I have come \ud83e\udd0f to telling him \"I love you\" plenty of times before this past weekend. \n\nSafe to say I am a very lucky baby. \nWe have a SBF(68M)/SGF(28F) dynamic, I spend a weekend at his place once or twice a month, have been on a couple little road trips, one overnight trip, and have 2 larger trips with airfare scheduled. \nI can't believe someone has been so kind to me, that they think I'm worth something like this. \n\nHe always says he wishes we met a long time ago (like physically impossible lol like both in our 30s) and fuck I wish we did too. \n\nI think I love him.\nThank you universe.\nThank you guys for reading.\n\nGood luck and if I don't see you,\nGood afternoon, good morning, and goodnight \ud83c\udf6d\n\nEdit : I got my first reddit award! And on a throw away sugar account! Woohoo! \ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd23 Thanks!!",

Only twice have I\u2019ve asked her to slow down on spending (Christmas and when decorating her apartment). She uses the cards for basic shopping and expenses. On top of this I give her money for her savings. I tell her I want her to feel the luxury lifestyle of being able to buy or do what you want (within reason). I also encourage her to take her friends out and treat them periodically. \n\nWhen it comes to jewelry or handbags, she usually lets me get those as gifts. \n\nI figure all this is still cheaper than having a wife \ud83e\udd23",

I\u2019d not put any limits out but I felt she went too far.   I\u2019m the end I told her that she bought her own Christmas present.

The arrangement though is I am there to look after her not her friends so if she goes out with them she has to go to places they can afford, not places they can\u2019t paid for by me.    The second thing is she has them as long as she is responsible with them and if she misuses them they go.  She\u2019s had them for a number of years now and so far I\u2019ve never had a reason for concern.  We do have a bit of fun with them though for example if we go out for a good meal and everyone is thinking SR, she takes the check being offered to me (with a loudish \u201cLet me get this\u201d to me) and pulls out her black card to pay.  You can see the WTF look on the faces of the waiter and those seated near us \ud83d\ude02.  She loves that and also that she can go into a store in her own right and buy something, not be seen as an SB having stuff bought for her.\n\nOn this particular case though my only advice to the OP is put the money somewhere separate and budget it throughout the year or you will likely find it all gone by 6 months or less.   And then you will be effectively back to not having a monthly allowance and needing to ask for more or move on to live.   But it sounds like the OP is a good responsible person who will not abuse the trust placed in her as it is with my SB.  And that means a lot to me because it means she\u2019s not just here for the money.",

I was assuming that someone wealthy enough to spoil the OP has a net worth over that amount. So what happens is he can give up to that amount away while he's alive, report it to the IRS each year, and deduct it from his lifetime exclusion. When he passes away only what's left of the exclusion is tax free. So you're correct that he won't be paying gift taxes most likely during his life (unless he's already given away his lifetime exclusion) but his estate will eventually pay that tax if his net worth is over the lifetime exclusion amount (12/6 million).

And by quality, they mean looks of course. Probably depends on geographic location, but still, I am curious where all the more attractive women have gone (assuming their assessments are correct). \n\nI would have guessed that there would still be plenty of pretty 23 year old girls on the site, as I'm not sure that the other looks-related moneymaking options have gotten better for those of us who are attractive but not literal models. But maybe I'm wrong about that? Or maybe, given that more men are entering the bowl as well, the male competition has gotten fiercer at the same time?\n\nI'm pretty curious about all this. \n\nAt this point in my life, I would not be interested in the market rate PPMs on offer, and am fine just working my vanilla job. I'd sooner try driving for Uber Eats as a side gig, after doing research on today's bowl. Perhaps women who aren't desperate feel the same as I do, whereas we would be on SA if we thought we could make more substantial amounts of money from it and deal with nicer men. Leaving only those women who are truly broke. I guess that's one theory I have.\n\nJust a random thought: I've also noticed that while some women view vanilla relationships as ultimately preferable, others enter the bowl because they have terrible vanilla experiences and think, \"I might as well get paid for this!\" Maybe the latter group is more likely to stick around, while the former group has just gone back to vanilla dating? I suppose it's possible that the second group helps drive down prices somewhat, too. I'm not sure what overall effect this has had on the competition though.",

Only twice have I\u2019ve asked her to slow down on spending (Christmas and when decorating her apartment). She uses the cards for basic shopping and expenses. On top of this I give her money for her savings. I tell her I want her to feel the luxury lifestyle of being able to buy or do what you want (within reason). I also encourage her to take her friends out and treat them periodically. \n\nWhen it comes to jewelry or handbags, she usually lets me get those as gifts. \n\nI figure all this is still cheaper than having a wife \ud83e\udd23",

The arrangement though is I am there to look after her not her friends so if she goes out with them she has to go to places they can afford, not places they can\u2019t paid for by me.    The second thing is she has them as long as she is responsible with them and if she misuses them they go.  She\u2019s had them for a number of years now and so far I\u2019ve never had a reason for concern.  We do have a bit of fun with them though for example if we go out for a good meal and everyone is thinking SR, she takes the check being offered to me (with a loudish \u201cLet me get this\u201d to me) and pulls out her black card to pay.  You can see the WTF look on the faces of the waiter and those seated near us \ud83d\ude02.  She loves that and also that she can go into a store in her own right and buy something, not be seen as an SB having stuff bought for her.\n\nOn this particular case though my only advice to the OP is put the money somewhere separate and budget it throughout the year or you will likely find it all gone by 6 months or less.   And then you will be effectively back to not having a monthly allowance and needing to ask for more or move on to live.   But it sounds like the OP is a good responsible person who will not abuse the trust placed in her as it is with my SB.  And that means a lot to me because it means she\u2019s not just here for the money.",

I was assuming that someone wealthy enough to spoil the OP has a net worth over that amount. So what happens is he can give up to that amount away while he's alive, report it to the IRS each year, and deduct it from his lifetime exclusion. When he passes away only what's left of the exclusion is tax free. So you're correct that he won't be paying gift taxes most likely during his life (unless he's already given away his lifetime exclusion) but his estate will eventually pay that tax if his net worth is over the lifetime exclusion amount (12/6 million). The sunsetting of this is a big deal for UHNW estates",

And by quality, they mean looks of course. Probably depends on geographic location, but still, I am curious where all the more attractive women have gone (assuming their assessments are correct). \n\nI would have guessed that there would still be plenty of pretty 23 year old girls on the site, as I'm not sure that the other looks-related moneymaking options have gotten better for those of us who are attractive but not literal models. But maybe I'm wrong about that? Or maybe, given that more men are entering the bowl as well, the male competition has gotten fiercer at the same time?\n\nI'm pretty curious about all this. \n\nAt this point in my life, I would not be interested in the market rate PPMs on offer, and am fine just working my vanilla job. I'd sooner try driving for Uber Eats as a side gig, after doing research on today's bowl. Perhaps women who aren't desperate feel the same as I do, whereas we would be on SA if we thought we could make more substantial amounts of money from it and deal with nicer men. Leaving only those women who are truly broke. I guess that's one theory I have.\n\nJust a random thought: I've also noticed that while some women view vanilla relationships as ultimately preferable, others enter the bowl because they have terrible vanilla experiences and think, \"I might as well get paid for this!\" Maybe the latter group is more likely to stick around, while the former group has just gone back to vanilla dating? I suppose it's possible that the second group helps drive down prices somewhat, too. I'm not sure what overall effect this has had on the competition though.",

The last month - when it was clear we were not going to be able to continue - she just went shopping and shopping and shopping.   Almost blew the - very high - limit.   I\u2019d not put any limits out but I felt she went too far.   I\u2019m the end I told her that she bought her own Christmas present.    So even though I had not put a limit on - she did go a bit too far.    I still like her and would be there for her but I\u2019d sure be a lot more clear in  the future.",

                    "body": "Mine has black and platinum credit cards on my account so she can do the weekly shopping, buy clothes etc and go out with friends.   The arrangement though is I am there to look after her not her friends so if she goes out with them she has to go to places they can afford, not places they can\u2019t paid for by me.    The second thing is she has them as long as she is responsible with them and if she misuses them they go.  She\u2019s had them for a number of years now and so far I\u2019ve never had a reason for concern.  We do have a bit of fun with them though for example if we go out for a good meal and everyone is thinking SR, she takes the check being offered to me (with a loudish \u201cLet me get this\u201d to me) and pulls out her black card to pay.  You can see the WTF look on the faces of the waiter and those seated near us \ud83d\ude02.  She loves that and also that she can go into a store in her own right and buy something, not be seen as an SB having stuff bought for her.\n\nOn this particular case though my only advice to the OP is put the money somewhere separate and budget it throughout the year or you will likely find it all gone by 6 months or less.   And then you will be effectively back to not having a monthly allowance and needing to ask for more or move on to live.   But it sounds like the OP is a good responsible person who will not abuse the trust placed in her as it is with my SB.  And that means a lot to me because it means she\u2019s not just here for the money.",

So what happens is he can give up to that amount away while he's alive, report it to the IRS each year, and deduct it from his lifetime exclusion. When he passes away only what's left of the exclusion is tax free. So you're correct that he won't be paying gift taxes most likely during his life (unless he's already given away his lifetime exclusion) but his estate will eventually pay that tax if his net worth is over the lifetime exclusion amount (12/6 million).

And by quality, they mean looks of course. Probably depends on geographic location, but still, I am curious where all the more attractive women have gone (assuming their assessments are correct). \n\nI would have guessed that there would still be plenty of pretty 23 year old girls on the site, as I'm not sure that the other looks-related moneymaking options have gotten better for those of us who are attractive but not literal models. But maybe I'm wrong about that? Or maybe, given that more men are entering the bowl as well, the male competition has gotten fiercer at the same time?\n\nI'm pretty curious about all this. \n\nAt this point in my life, I would not be interested in the market rate PPMs on offer, and am fine just working my vanilla job. I'd sooner try driving for Uber Eats as a side gig, after doing research on today's bowl. Perhaps women who aren't desperate feel the same as I do, whereas we would be on SA if we thought we could make more substantial amounts of money from it and deal with nicer men. Leaving only those women who are truly broke. I guess that's one theory I have.\n\nJust a random thought: I've also noticed that while some women view vanilla relationships as ultimately preferable, others enter the bowl because they have terrible vanilla experiences and think, \"I might as well get paid for this!\" Maybe the latter group is more likely to stick around, while the former group has just gone back to vanilla dating? I suppose it's possible that the second group helps drive down prices somewhat, too. I'm not sure what overall effect this has had on the competition though.",

The arrangement though is I am there to look after her not her friends so if she goes out with them she has to go to places they can afford, not places they can\u2019t paid for by me.    The second thing is she has them as long as she is responsible with them and if she misuses them they go.  She\u2019s had them for a number of years now and so far I\u2019ve never had a reason for concern.  We do have a bit of fun with them though for example if we go out for a good meal and everyone is thinking SR, she takes the check being offered to me (with a loudish \u201cLet me get this\u201d to me) and pulls out her black card to pay.  You can see the WTF look on the faces of the waiter and those seated near us \ud83d\ude02.  She loves that and also that she can go into a store in her own right and buy something, not be seen as an SB having stuff bought for her.\n\nOn this particular case though my only advice to the OP is put the money somewhere separate and budget it throughout the year or you will likely find it all gone by 6 months or less.   And then you will be effectively back to not having a monthly allowance and needing to ask for more or move on to live.   But it sounds like the OP is a good responsible person who will not abuse the trust placed in her as it is with my SB.  And that means a lot to me because it means she\u2019s not just here for the money.",

I was assuming that someone wealthy enough to spoil the OP has a net worth over that amount. So what happens is he can give up to that amount away while he's alive, report it to the IRS each year, and deduct it from his lifetime exclusion. When he passes away only what's left of the exclusion is tax free. So you're correct that he won't be paying gift taxes most likely during his life (unless he's already given away his lifetime exclusion) but his estate will eventually pay that tax if his net worth is over the lifetime exclusion amount (12/6 million).

And by quality, they mean looks of course. Probably depends on geographic location, but still, I am curious where all the more attractive women have gone (assuming their assessments are correct). \n\nI would have guessed that there would still be plenty of pretty 23 year old girls on the site, as I'm not sure that the other looks-related moneymaking options have gotten better for those of us who are attractive but not literal models. But maybe I'm wrong about that? Or maybe, given that more men are entering the bowl as well, the male competition has gotten fiercer at the same time?\n\nI'm pretty curious about all this. \n\nAt this point in my life, I would not be interested in the market rate PPMs on offer, and am fine just working my vanilla job. I'd sooner try driving for Uber Eats as a side gig, after doing research on today's bowl. Perhaps women who aren't desperate feel the same as I do, whereas we would be on SA if we thought we could make more substantial amounts of money from it and deal with nicer men. Leaving only those women who are truly broke. I guess that's one theory I have.\n\nJust a random thought: I've also noticed that while some women view vanilla relationships as ultimately preferable, others enter the bowl because they have terrible vanilla experiences and think, \"I might as well get paid for this!\" Maybe the latter group is more likely to stick around, while the former group has just gone back to vanilla dating? I suppose it's possible that the second group helps drive down prices somewhat, too. I'm not sure what overall effect this has had on the competition though.",

They didn't go anywhere.  They are still on seeking.

But maybe I'm wrong about that? Or maybe, given that more men are entering the bowl as well, the male competition has gotten fiercer at the same time?\n\nI'm pretty curious about all this. \n\nAt this point in my life, I would not be interested in the market rate PPMs on offer, and am fine just working my vanilla job. I'd sooner try driving for Uber Eats as a side gig, after doing research on today's bowl. Perhaps women who aren't desperate feel the same as I do, whereas we would be on SA if we thought we could make more substantial amounts of money from it and deal with nicer men. Leaving only those women who are truly broke. I guess that's one theory I have.\n\nJust a random thought: I've also noticed that while some women view vanilla relationships as ultimately preferable, others enter the bowl because they have terrible vanilla experiences and think, \"I might as well get paid for this!\" Maybe the latter group is more likely to stick around, while the former group has just gone back to vanilla dating? I suppose it's possible that the second group helps drive down prices somewhat, too. I'm not sure what overall effect this has had on the competition though.",
