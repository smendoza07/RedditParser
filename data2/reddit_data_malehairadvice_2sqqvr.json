    "body": "I posted asking on how to style my hair like how the barber did it. \n\nInstead of getting helpful comments,  I just got made fun of for my looks. \n\nI got one helpful comment.   That's it. \n\nOne. \n\nThe rest all just gave me shit about my chinstrap.  They weren't very well put comments like \"hey you should shave that it doesn't look good\"\nThey were more like \"youre an asshole and a douche with that facial hair\" \n\nI understand this sub is here to help people with their looks. But how does insulting someone over and over help anything? If anything it just will make them lose confidence.  So thanks for that.  \n\nI will not be coming back to this sub anytime soon.   Because when you ask for advice you're lucky to get one reply.   UNLESS there's something that everyone can make fun of.  \n\n\n\n",

You kinda only really did one angle, multiple times, so we can only see it from that one shot, if that makes sense.\n\nI agree with most the comments made. I personally am not a fan of the chinstrap, but that maybe because I can't grow facial hair for shit and am subconsciously jealous. I do think you'd look better without it though.\n\nStyling, you can just blow dry your hair and use pomade/wax. I stick with hairspray myself because its not a bitch to get out and it takes a lot less time.",
