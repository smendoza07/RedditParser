    "body": "[Edit: if you read this in it\u2019s entirety, you\u2019ll see that I do not bash men/SDs and actually delve into the risks SDs face, as well, validating the notion that all parties involved face different potential issues and deserve to be safe and comfortable in a SR. This is *not* an, \u201cI hate men,\u201d post nor is is a, \u201cwe SBs can do no wrong,\u201d testament.]\n\nThere have been several posts, here lately, regarding consent, money, and the inherently risky lifestyle we choose to participate in when diving into the bowl. A few comments I left on said posts made me want to ensure a larger audience views what I have to add to those discussions. This first part is for SDs to read: you should always make sure your SB feels safe, heard, considered, and that she fully consents to whatever intimacy might take place on a date, every single time. \n\nAlmost every SD I\u2019ve ever moved past the meet and greet with has extended all of these *basic decencies* to me, along with genuine concern, compassion and care. However, the few terrible experiences I\u2019ve had were far more than enough to make me set irrevocable and unconditional rules in place, for myself. Any POT that takes issue with these rules can kick fucking rocks. No amount of money or companionship is worth my physical safety and mental health, nor is it yours, SBs. \n\nI\u2019ve seen several comments in which \u201cSDs\u201d claim our stories of assault, theft, and more are made up/lies/elaborated stories. I\u2019m here to tell you that isn\u2019t true, and almost every woman I know has been sexually assaulted at least once in her life, outside of the bowl. *Every* SB I know has been at *least* calculatedly pushed past her limits, physically, at a minimum of once. Listen to us, and then be better than the trash humans that have violated us. \n\nAfter going to a hotel following a three-hour first dinner date with a POT, being intimate for *hours,* and watching him \u201cexcuse himself to the bathroom,\u201d only to grab the cash he\u2019d set on the dresser and bolt out the door, sending me a text five minutes later saying, \u201cthanks for the hot fun, feel free to stay in the room tonight,\u201d I\u2019ll *never* partake in intimacy without receiving the PPM first until a SR is well beyond established. \n\nAfter going to a POT\u2019s rental on the *third* date for our first intimate encounter, having a couple of glasses of wine, consenting to light touching and kissing but *not* consenting to sex and loudly saying, \u201cno,\u201d as he forced himself inside of me, continuing until he finished and then leaving me sobbing and naked while he dressed and left, I\u2019ll *never* ignore my gut feeling, again, nor will I *ever* consume alcohol on a sugar date. I felt uncomfortable with him, upon entering the room, and chose to have a few drinks to \u201cloosen up.\u201d Biggest mistake I have ever made in the bowl. \n\nAfter agreeing to an end-of-month allowance from the start with a new SD (he gave me a generous cash gift at the meet and greet, effectively earning my trust), only to have five intimate dates with him over the course of a month and then get ghosted, never receiving an allowance or a goodbye, I\u2019ll *never* accept an allowance over PPM before the SR is well established, again. PPM doesn\u2019t only protect SDs, y\u2019all! Get it and get it in *cash,* before clothes come off, until you truly and entirely trust each other! \n\nAll of this happened to me early on in my sugaring experience. I was a young, naive little thing. I\u2019ve always made a conscious effort to see the best in people and am both honest and optimistic to a fault. I learned several extremely harsh lessons in the most difficult of ways. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m able to use my experience to help new SBs, now. There\u2019s gotta be a silver lining! That\u2019s mine. \n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nThis is an unbelievably important topic. \n\nI am fully aware of and empathetic to the fact that SDs are taken advantage of, lied to and stolen from, doxxed, threatened, scammed and more. It shouldn\u2019t happen. You don\u2019t deserve it. \n\nHowever, none of that will ever compare in severity to being raped, being fucked and not given the promised PPM, or being physically attacked/assaulted in any way. SBs are *also* lied to, stolen from, taken advantage of, doxxed, threatened, blackmailed regarding photos etc., *and* we have to constantly and vigilantly be aware of the fact that literally *any* seemingly kind and genuine SD could force themselves on us, assault us in numerous ways etc. \n\nThis is why the SD should offer the PPM before clothes come off (even if it\u2019s just slipping it into her purse or lying it on the table), every time, regardless of what they\u2019ve experienced in the past. Having a SB take the money and run, while horrible and unacceptable, will simply *never* be as traumatic and devastating as having a SD partake in intimacy and bolt, leaving you nude and confused, without any monetary compensation or answers.\n\nNobody deserves to be used, abused or lied to, and this applies to all participating parties, man or woman or non-binary, SD or SB or whomever else. I just cannot stand seeing SDs in this sub make outrageous claims regarding their risk being as high or higher than that of a SB. Losing a few bennies is not as bad as having your body used, or worse, being raped. [Edit: being blackmailed/extorted is absolutely devastating and I recognize that it has the potential of ruining your life/marriage/family dynamic, custody and more. I just wish that SDs would understand SBs *also* run these risks. Many of us have families and important jobs/circles as well! Many of us have been blackmailed etc., too.]\n\nWe can all do better. We are all in this world together. Stop talking over and down to others, and *hear* their experiences. The chances of a story being made up exist, but the fact of the matter is a negligible percentage of rape claims are proven to be falsified, and that doesn\u2019t change in the bowl. I\u2019m not saying that SBs aren\u2019t guilty of being trash humans, as well. All participants have the capacity to be a piece of walking shit. Be safe. Be smart. Talk to others with more experience. Read the sticky posts. *Screen* and *vet* your POTs and go on a *public* meet and greet that does *not* have the immediate plan of intimacy, directly following. Take some time to consider what you felt, after leaving that meet and greet. Plan the first date for a day or two later. Soak up your intuition and move on with the knowledge that it could go wrong, and the hope that it will go right! This is advice for SDs and SBs alike. I have so much love for this community! Thanks for reading and engaging in discussion!",

Unfortunately the SDs that think that getting their cash stolen is on par with being raped or physically harmed just can't be reasoned with. They lack the empathy and logic to look outside of their situation and see that the levels of risk just aren't the same.\n\nI'm lucky enough never to have been sexually assaulted in the bowl, but I have POTs that were not cool and seemed to share the same sentiments as these guys. I find a good screening method is to lay out your boundaries/rules as soon as possible. Not the sexiest conversation to have, but if he understands the varying levels of risk that SRs come with he will understand.",

            "body": "Thank you for this post. It's incredibly helpful and insightful.\n\nTwo stories of mine to illustrate the important point of power imbalances between genders and the realities we each face in dating, both sugar and vanilla. I was in bed with a guy a few months ago doing some pillow talk, and this subject came up. I asked him, \"How often do you worry about being raped on a first date?\" He replied, \"I've never worried about being raped. Not once.\"\n\nI told him, \"I worry about being raped on literally every date I'm on until trust has been established. Even still sometimes afterwards.\" He looked at me with shock and almost disbelief. Also, I'm a trans woman, and I told him, \"I never worried about this when I presented as male. This is literally something I only learned to worry about due to my experiences with men as a woman after I came out.\"\n\nThe threat is real. Just last night, I was in a guy's car after a M&G finishing off our convo clutching my pink mace hidden next to my leg because he got weird, agitated, and loud when the subject of nonbinary people came up (he brought it up, not me). I began fearing for my safety and became visibly uncomfortable and quiet. He didn't notice because he was wrapped up in \"educating\" me on gender and the Bill of Rights (I went to school for political science, sociology, and history, have a masters in labor relations, and hardly need to be educated about the Constitution by a guy who works in IT)...I can't make this stuff up. And he still pressured me for a BJ in the car. Of course, I said no, but he continued to press for a few minutes before backing down.\n\nNothing even remotely close to the experiences I've had while out as a women ever happened to me when I presented as a man. Please respect women and nonbinary people and understand that the world we navigate is not the same as the one men navigate. \ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc97",

One of my long term SGFs moved thousands of miles away for graduate school, which was when we ended things. She then, using only her experience with me as evidence that dating older wealthy men was easy, safe, and great, decided to sign up for SA and a few other sites to find someone similar in her new (major) city. She ignored my advice re: needing to be careful, went and met a guy, agreed to go back to his hotel room, and got raped. Went to the police. Got slut shamed when she told them where she\u2019d met the guy etc. I felt partially responsible and spent way more time and energy helping her deal with the aftermath and her recovery in the months that followed than I needed to. I\u2019ve also had more than a few former partners and friends who\u2019ve been raped. It\u2019s something incredibly traumatic and way beyond what we SDs typically risk in pursuing these types of relationships.",

I agree that the risks you enumerated are just not on the same level as the risks SBs face.  That said, when I was sugaring back when I was married with children, my worst risk was not losing PPM or being extorted, it was that someone would contact my wife, and I would lose her (I was not ready to lose my beloved wife despite sugaring, and this is not uncommon).  More importantly, a nasty divorce can and does traumatize children forever, and for me, destroying the innocent lives of the people I cherish most in the world -- the ones who I am basically living for since the day they were born -- is me being a failure as a father and a man.  This can and does happen -- it's happened right on this sub, multiple times.  Hopefully you see the magnitude of what's at stake.  I am not claiming this is worse than what SBs face -- in fact, I don't think comparing does us any good -- just trying to get across that there are tragic outcomes far beyond what you listed, that we're trying to avoid.\n\nIt is ironic that many of the posts that are most strident about \"you other people aren't listening\", are always the ones who don't listen themselves, seek to minimize and ridicule anyone else's risks.  Instead of ridiculing, you'd think they'd ask, \"Okay, I'm willing to listen and learn too.  There must be something more you fear than PPM loss.  What is it?\"  I will tell you, every SD checks out as soon as we hear \"losing PPM is your worst risk?  What a loser\", it tells us that whoever is talking to us doesn't understand, or want to understand, what we're thinking; they're in this for upvotes or to vent, not dialog and behavior change.  If dialog, understanding, and changing behavior is your goal, start with yourself.   (\"You\" does not refer to foxy here.  But it does apply as much to me as anyone else.).\n\n**Second, caution on internet stories is not unreasonable**.  Because stories of sexual assault, and worse, are so serious, I personally have a simple strategy for responses: validate, sympathize, validate, suggest seeking help if warranted.  There are some big-hearted SDs and SBs who offer to send monetary help, and I suggest caution there, for reasons that should be obvious to anyone who has been on the internet for more than a day.",

That sugar babies don't have a leg to stand on if they're taken advantage and have sex in exchange for nothing, because they're not prostitutes and not entitled to the compensation that was previously agreed upon? \n\nIf you are the type of SD who would have sex with an SB knowing she expects a PPM or allowance, and you don't hold up your end of the bargain, that is really really scummy. It would not make your SB a prostitute for expecting to be paid. It would make you guilty of sexual coercion and being a predatory SD who takes advantage of an SB's expectations for his own sexual gratification. I hope to god that if you do have an SB, you don't shame her for having financial expectations in your relationship. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf that is not the point you were trying to make, then I'm not sure why you felt like this was an appropriate time to make that comment. We are talking about rape and really demoralizing and dehumanizing experiences that many women have had. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am so tired of men who clutch their pearls at the thought of \"paying for sex\" and decry the idea of prostitution. If you are ashamed that there is a financial component to your SR, then perhaps vanilla dating is a better option. The idea that SBs expect financial compensation in an intimate relationship should not offend you. It's meant to be a mutually beneficial exchange, and typically in SRs that exchange is intimacy for financial benefit (and hopefully additionally mutual respect, genuine connection and fondness, and maybe even love, depending on the SR and the preferences of the parties involved).",

With SRs it is because we are in a *very* specific kind of relationship which equalizes our age/attractiveness/economic gap to the point where we can get to know eachother. \n\nWithout the presence of that I would not have consented to intimacy with the person. If the relationship does not work out because of unpredicted external factors (ie it turns out we are not compatible) then that's fine. But if it turns out that the person was lying about an SR from the beginning to have sex with me in a situation I never would, then it's definitely coercion.",

With respect though, your advice to SDs, like myself, who act responsibly in the bowl is a tad gratuitous.  Many of us \"always make sure your SB feels safe, heard, considered, and that she fully consents to whatever intimacy might take place on a date, every single time\".  This is a result of the nature of one's character and values and not done at the urging of an abused SB. The ratbag SDs that treat SBs as you have described are not listening and never likely to.\n\nLecturing about how we should pay sugar is also gratuitous advice.  There is no universal code on how to conduct an SR and there never will be.  If you have a set of rules SDs need to respect in your SRs (and you should) including how to pay sugar then a POT can except them or walk.\n\nRehashing the personal impact of being raped or robbed in or outside the bowl and how men can't relate to this (self-evident and needless to say) may feel liberating and allow you to express your moral outrage but in the end will not change the character or attitudes of those who are inclined to such violence and abuse.  You will however be rewarded with go-girl and sympathy commentary if that's what you seek.\n\nYour contribution is better directed at newbie SBs who will benefit from your experience and insights here. There are risks to call out about sugaring regardless of whether some of the risks are greater or more traumatic for SBs than SDs.  You have mentioned many such risks and they should be taken into consideration when entering into and participating in the bowl.\n\nFinally, sugaring is a totally voluntary lifestyle, accept the risks or get/stay out of it. There are bad players in every walk of life and raising awareness is useful and important but keep in mind who your audience is here. I suspect most SDs in this sub are responsible actors in the bowl and we don't appreciate being lectured here, ad nauseum, about how insensitive men are to the trauma rape has on women.  It does not help that rape allegations have been weaponized by some women to intentionally destroy men's lives and this behavior has a desensitizing effect on men.",

I took issue with your desire to tell SDs here how they should conduct themselves in an SR and your discussion of rape in particular, nowhere did I insult you or intend to.

My comments were in rebuttal to yours, intended to be a constructive critique, not lecturing.\n\nActually I largely agree with much of what you said so yes, my comments narrowly focus on where we don't agree - as you say, a difference of opinion. Also agree that much of your post was interesting insight and led to constructive discussion.  Some of the replies are sympathy and go-girl responses regardless of your intention which I did not really challenge.\n\nWhen posting such content, expect controversy where you target men's attitudes and behaviors.  For the record, I find rape abhorrent.  My last line regarding rape allegations is simply an inconvenient truth that we see play out in society quite regularly due to the bias that a woman must always be believed when making such allegations.

That doesn\u2019t negate the fact that in comparison to the number of allegations proven to be false, insanely more (63%) are never even reported and are 100% true. Statistics cite that as few as 2% of allegations are false. The likelihood of a story you read about a woman\u2019s (or man\u2019s) assault/rape being true is much, much higher than anything else.\n\nAgree that the legal system is slow, cumbersome and harsh with respect to the victim. It needs continuous reform for sure and no doubt contributes to the unwillingness of women to bring charges. However, it's a very serious allegation that can destroy a man's life, the presumption of innocence until proven guilty must be the guiding principle.  False allegation happens more often than you suggest.\n\n>I\u2019m not here to argue or be put down; I\u2019m only interested in genuinely interested/constructive discussion/debate.\n\nIf by constructive discussion/debate you mean primarily engaging with people who praise or agree with you that's not really engaging in debate is it.  I plead innocent to the charge of my tone being condescending or putting you down, the most negative interpretation of my comments possible.  I disagreed with some of your comments directed at men.  Those comments drew praise from the sisterhood but I can assure you most SDs here would have just rolled their eyes in a \"here we go again\" moment.\n\n>That\u2019s too bad. It\u2019s an important topic, and I don\u2019t plan on sitting here quietly.\n\nAgree that rape is an important topic.  Never suggested otherwise but it's an explosive topic that stirs strong emotions and a topic in its own right.  Preach to the converted if you must but as I said, the perpetrators of such violence are not listening here.  I dare suggest that most SDs who participate in this forum do not condone rape. If you actually encounter a man who downplays rape, heap all the scorn on him he deservers.\n\nOf course you're under no obligation to engage with me but I appreciate that you have.  We agree on much more than we disagree.  I don't like wasting energy either so don't post often here.  Your female lens on sugaring is just that, a female perspective.  If you really want to know what men think about such topics then be open to the response and give the respondent the benefit of the doubt.  I was not \"arguing\" with you, we were having a discussion about some of the views expressed in your post that I thought were gratuitous advice to men that participate in this sub.",

                                                    "body": "My post was about far more than rape. I was not preaching or lecturing; I was making several valid points and clearly delving into the details regarding those points. Men/SDs that perpetrate the issues I presented are obviously not my targeted audience, as I\u2019d never expect my words to change the fact that they\u2019re rude/willfully ignorant/misogynistic/sociopathic/narcissistic/rapists (in order of ascending severity). The purpose was for good, honest SDs to read and comprehend, in a post about these issues that wasn\u2019t also relentlessly bashing men/blaming them for all the world\u2019s problems, what we, as SBs, risk and face on a daily basis in the bowl. I intended to stir some compassion and understanding from those that might not have considered things in quite the light I\u2019d explained them, which I feel I succeeded in doing. I\u2019m sure I also provoked thought, in the very least, in plenty that didn\u2019t comment to let me know they read all of this. \n\nI am always open to response/discussion. What I am not open to is being told what I meant/what my intentions were; in reading your comments I\u2019ve gotten the (admittedly, self-determined) impression that you were doing both of those things. In addition to that, you do not speak for all men/SDs. You cannot possibly know that the general reaction to much of what I wrote would be eye-rolling/\u201chere we go again.\u201d\n\nYou seem to have missed, in recent history on SLF, comments from men saying things such as, \u201cyou knew the risks,\u201d and worse in response to SBs posting stating their POT had run off after sleeping with them, without leaving the PPM, and other such atrocities. Again, my post addressed far more than rape. \n\nYou also seem to automatically assign \u201cresponsible\u201d as a trait to SLF SDs by default, when it would only make sense to assume, based on all of the reading and conversing I\u2019ve done here, that there are many types of men/SDs lurking in and participating in this forum. The advice you have repeatedly told me was *gratuitous* wasn\u2019t for you, or other SDs like you, to take to heart. It was for others that might not realize what many of us have been through/experienced in the bowl. It was for those skeptics that still have goodness in their hearts to read and take pause, encouraging a thought process they\u2019d perhaps not otherwise have had, and consideration they\u2019d perhaps not had, likewise. In addition to that, for those of you that are already wonderful, safe and trustworthy SDs, seeing stories like these from someone active in the community, that doesn\u2019t bash men or adopt a \u201cfuck all men\u201d attitude, and that often engages in kind/genuine conversation with SDs about a wide array of topics, opens the door to lessening aforementioned skepticism and to more understanding and compassion for specific risks SBs take to be with you. \n\nYou are right, my perspective is that which has a feminine lens. I felt many SDs needed to read a post like this through such a lens; I also wanted to ensure newer/younger SBs knew without a doubt that they aren\u2019t alone, can speak up and deserve to feel safe, even if that means setting boundaries they\u2019ve been told by SDs in the past aren\u2019t \u201cnormal\u201d or make them seem \u201cprudish.\u201d We do agree on a lot. What we disagree on, you seem to be consistent in missing or misunderstanding my explanations of, which is fine. I don\u2019t ever expect to walk away from a conversation having found myself seeing eye to eye on everything discussed with everyone whom I discussed things.",

No one is defending actual rape. What causes the controversy is when others use of the term rape to a variety of other things that, while dastardly, are not rape. Terms have to have meaning or they are useless. In your post, it was clearly non-consensual, but importantly it was contemporaneously non-consensual. What people are arguing about is not your situation. They are arguing about the attempt to back-date non-consent. In an earlier account the SB, by her own account, said she had really great sex with pot. That sounds consensual by anyone's measure. Contemporaneous to the encounter it was very clearly consensual. However, many posters went on to try to back-date consensual sex into rape because of the lack of payment. What it dirty and shitty? Of course it was and NO ONE defended it. What many objected to was the attempt to make shitty behavior into rape after the fact. It's a slippery slope. The reason it got heated was because many posters claimed any objection to misusing the term was victim blaming and even rapists. Again, terms have to meaning or they are useless. Making any bad behavior into rape makes he term rape meaningless. I might punch a guy in the face and its called battery. It is not, however, murder.",

I fairly represented both sides of what I spoke about. This post is not solely about rape. \n\nI also discussed several different ways in which SBs are often physically taken advantage of, *including* but *not* limited to rape. In addition to that, rape is an umbrella term that includes many more scenarios than a man shoving his P in a woman\u2019s V as she screams, \u201cno!\u201d Consent absolutely can be withdrawn. Consent also cannot be given in certain situations. There is absolutely a slippery slope to be slidden down, but I didn\u2019t come anywhere near to tripping and falling, let alone onto it. \n\nLastly, SDs in this sub *absolutely have* accused SBs of elaborating stories, lying all together and making fictitious posts in an act of malice against men, \u201call men,\u201d due to hating the entire gender. That isn\u2019t usually true. SDs in this sub have also blatantly said, \u201cyOu KnEw ThE rIsKs,\u201d on posts about rape/assault/being physically taken advantage of, as well as, \u201cyou got what you deserved.\u201d Don\u2019t make blanket statements or act like you concretely know beyond a shadow of a doubt whether something has happened or not, when you clearly do not actually know the truth. \n\nI have explained my side, discussed the side of SDs with several that were willing to have an actual conversation and done it all politely and with dignity.

Because stories of sexual assault, and worse, are so serious, I personally have a simple strategy for responses: validate, sympathize, validate, suggest seeking help if warranted.  There are some big-hearted SDs and SBs who offer to send monetary help, and I suggest caution there, for reasons that should be obvious to anyone who has been on the internet for more than a day.\n\nA thought on that: I'm chronically suspicious about whether any particular \"internet story\" is real or fake, especially when the person telling the story describes experiencing some kind of harm. But it's important to keep in mind that some types of stories are popular BECAUSE they describe experiences that, sadly, happen far too often in reality, such as sexual assault and sexual abuse of girls and young women.",

That sugar babies don't have a leg to stand on if they're taken advantage and have sex in exchange for nothing, because they're not prostitutes and not entitled to the compensation that was previously agreed upon? \n\nIf you are the type of SD who would have sex with an SB knowing she expects a PPM or allowance, and you don't hold up your end of the bargain, that is really really scummy. It would not make your SB a prostitute for expecting to be paid. It would make you guilty of sexual coercion and being a predatory SD who takes advantage of an SB's expectations for his own sexual gratification. I hope to god that if you do have an SB, you don't shame her for having financial expectations in your relationship. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf that is not the point you were trying to make, then I'm not sure why you felt like this was an appropriate time to make that comment. We are talking about rape and really demoralizing and dehumanizing experiences that many women have had. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am so tired of men who clutch their pearls at the thought of \"paying for sex\" and decry the idea of prostitution. If you are ashamed that there is a financial component to your SR, then perhaps vanilla dating is a better option. The idea that SBs expect financial compensation in an intimate relationship should not offend you. It's meant to be a mutually beneficial exchange, and typically in SRs that exchange is intimacy for financial benefit (and hopefully additionally mutual respect, genuine connection and fondness, and maybe even love, depending on the SR and the preferences of the parties involved).",

With SRs it is because we are in a *very* specific kind of relationship which equalizes our age/attractiveness/economic gap to the point where we can get to know eachother. \n\nWithout the presence of that I would not have consented to intimacy with the person. If the relationship does not work out because of unpredicted external factors (ie it turns out we are not compatible) then that's fine. But if it turns out that the person was lying about an SR from the beginning to have sex with me in a situation I never would, then it's definitely coercion.",

                    "body": "Interesting takeaway on my post, where exactly did I \"insult\" you Foxy?  I took issue with your desire to tell SDs here how they should conduct themselves in an SR and your discussion of rape in particular, nowhere did I insult you or intend to.  Give me the benefit of the doubt and I will extend the same courtesy to you.\n\nDisagreement does not constitute insult, you chose to be offended in order to largely ignore and dismiss my comments without addressing any of the points I made and that's your prerogative.\n\nI used the term lecture to refer to your clear desire to gratuitously educate men here on their behavior and attitudes. My comments were in rebuttal to yours, intended to be a constructive critique, not lecturing.\n\nActually I largely agree with much of what you said so yes, my comments narrowly focus on where we don't agree - as you say, a difference of opinion. Also agree that much of your post was interesting insight and led to constructive discussion.  Some of the replies are sympathy and go-girl responses regardless of your intention which I did not really challenge.\n\nWhen posting such content, expect controversy where you target men's attitudes and behaviors.  For the record, I find rape abhorrent.  My last line regarding rape allegations is simply an inconvenient truth that we see play out in society quite regularly due to the bias that a woman must always be believed when making such allegations.  Where proven in a court of law, only jail time is an appropriate sentence.",

It needs continuous reform for sure and no doubt contributes to the unwillingness of women to bring charges. However, it's a very serious allegation that can destroy a man's life, the presumption of innocence until proven guilty must be the guiding principle.  False allegation happens more often than you suggest.\n\n>I\u2019m not here to argue or be put down; I\u2019m only interested in genuinely interested/constructive discussion/debate.\n\nIf by constructive discussion/debate you mean primarily engaging with people who praise or agree with you that's not really engaging in debate is it.  I plead innocent to the charge of my tone being condescending or putting you down, the most negative interpretation of my comments possible.  I disagreed with some of your comments directed at men.  Those comments drew praise from the sisterhood but I can assure you most SDs here would have just rolled their eyes in a \"here we go again\" moment.\n\n>That\u2019s too bad. It\u2019s an important topic, and I don\u2019t plan on sitting here quietly.\n\nAgree that rape is an important topic.  Never suggested otherwise but it's an explosive topic that stirs strong emotions and a topic in its own right.  Preach to the converted if you must but as I said, the perpetrators of such violence are not listening here.  I dare suggest that most SDs who participate in this forum do not condone rape. If you actually encounter a man who downplays rape, heap all the scorn on him he deservers.\n\nOf course you're under no obligation to engage with me but I appreciate that you have.  We agree on much more than we disagree.  I don't like wasting energy either so don't post often here.  Your female lens on sugaring is just that, a female perspective.  If you really want to know what men think about such topics then be open to the response and give the respondent the benefit of the doubt.  I was not \"arguing\" with you, we were having a discussion about some of the views expressed in your post that I thought were gratuitous advice to men that participate in this sub.",

                                            "body": "My post was about far more than rape. I was not preaching or lecturing; I was making several valid points and clearly delving into the details regarding those points. Men/SDs that perpetrate the issues I presented are obviously not my targeted audience, as I\u2019d never expect my words to change the fact that they\u2019re rude/willfully ignorant/misogynistic/sociopathic/narcissistic/rapists (in order of ascending severity). The purpose was for good, honest SDs to read and comprehend, in a post about these issues that wasn\u2019t also relentlessly bashing men/blaming them for all the world\u2019s problems, what we, as SBs, risk and face on a daily basis in the bowl. I intended to stir some compassion and understanding from those that might not have considered things in quite the light I\u2019d explained them, which I feel I succeeded in doing. I\u2019m sure I also provoked thought, in the very least, in plenty that didn\u2019t comment to let me know they read all of this. \n\nI am always open to response/discussion. What I am not open to is being told what I meant/what my intentions were; in reading your comments I\u2019ve gotten the (admittedly, self-determined) impression that you were doing both of those things. In addition to that, you do not speak for all men/SDs. You cannot possibly know that the general reaction to much of what I wrote would be eye-rolling/\u201chere we go again.\u201d\n\nYou seem to have missed, in recent history on SLF, comments from men saying things such as, \u201cyou knew the risks,\u201d and worse in response to SBs posting stating their POT had run off after sleeping with them, without leaving the PPM, and other such atrocities. Again, my post addressed far more than rape. \n\nYou also seem to automatically assign \u201cresponsible\u201d as a trait to SLF SDs by default, when it would only make sense to assume, based on all of the reading and conversing I\u2019ve done here, that there are many types of men/SDs lurking in and participating in this forum. The advice you have repeatedly told me was *gratuitous* wasn\u2019t for you, or other SDs like you, to take to heart. It was for others that might not realize what many of us have been through/experienced in the bowl. It was for those skeptics that still have goodness in their hearts to read and take pause, encouraging a thought process they\u2019d perhaps not otherwise have had, and consideration they\u2019d perhaps not had, likewise. In addition to that, for those of you that are already wonderful, safe and trustworthy SDs, seeing stories like these from someone active in the community, that doesn\u2019t bash men or adopt a \u201cfuck all men\u201d attitude, and that often engages in kind/genuine conversation with SDs about a wide array of topics, opens the door to lessening aforementioned skepticism and to more understanding and compassion for specific risks SBs take to be with you. \n\nYou are right, my perspective is that which has a feminine lens. I felt many SDs needed to read a post like this through such a lens; I also wanted to ensure newer/younger SBs knew without a doubt that they aren\u2019t alone, can speak up and deserve to feel safe, even if that means setting boundaries they\u2019ve been told by SDs in the past aren\u2019t \u201cnormal\u201d or make them seem \u201cprudish.\u201d We do agree on a lot. What we disagree on, you seem to be consistent in missing or misunderstanding my explanations of, which is fine. I don\u2019t ever expect to walk away from a conversation having found myself seeing eye to eye on everything discussed with everyone whom I discussed things.",

That sugar babies don't have a leg to stand on if they're taken advantage and have sex in exchange for nothing, because they're not prostitutes and not entitled to the compensation that was previously agreed upon? \n\nIf you are the type of SD who would have sex with an SB knowing she expects a PPM or allowance, and you don't hold up your end of the bargain, that is really really scummy. It would not make your SB a prostitute for expecting to be paid. It would make you guilty of sexual coercion and being a predatory SD who takes advantage of an SB's expectations for his own sexual gratification. I hope to god that if you do have an SB, you don't shame her for having financial expectations in your relationship. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf that is not the point you were trying to make, then I'm not sure why you felt like this was an appropriate time to make that comment. We are talking about rape and really demoralizing and dehumanizing experiences that many women have had. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am so tired of men who clutch their pearls at the thought of \"paying for sex\" and decry the idea of prostitution. If you are ashamed that there is a financial component to your SR, then perhaps vanilla dating is a better option. The idea that SBs expect financial compensation in an intimate relationship should not offend you. It's meant to be a mutually beneficial exchange, and typically in SRs that exchange is intimacy for financial benefit (and hopefully additionally mutual respect, genuine connection and fondness, and maybe even love, depending on the SR and the preferences of the parties involved).",

I took issue with your desire to tell SDs here how they should conduct themselves in an SR and your discussion of rape in particular, nowhere did I insult you or intend to.  Give me the benefit of the doubt and I will extend the same courtesy to you.\n\nDisagreement does not constitute insult, you chose to be offended in order to largely ignore and dismiss my comments without addressing any of the points I made and that's your prerogative.\n\nI used the term lecture to refer to your clear desire to gratuitously educate men here on their behavior and attitudes. My comments were in rebuttal to yours, intended to be a constructive critique, not lecturing.\n\nActually I largely agree with much of what you said so yes, my comments narrowly focus on where we don't agree - as you say, a difference of opinion. Also agree that much of your post was interesting insight and led to constructive discussion.  Some of the replies are sympathy and go-girl responses regardless of your intention which I did not really challenge.\n\nWhen posting such content, expect controversy where you target men's attitudes and behaviors.  For the record, I find rape abhorrent.  My last line regarding rape allegations is simply an inconvenient truth that we see play out in society quite regularly due to the bias that a woman must always be believed when making such allegations.  Where proven in a court of law, only jail time is an appropriate sentence.",

It needs continuous reform for sure and no doubt contributes to the unwillingness of women to bring charges. However, it's a very serious allegation that can destroy a man's life, the presumption of innocence until proven guilty must be the guiding principle.  False allegation happens more often than you suggest.\n\n>I\u2019m not here to argue or be put down; I\u2019m only interested in genuinely interested/constructive discussion/debate.\n\nIf by constructive discussion/debate you mean primarily engaging with people who praise or agree with you that's not really engaging in debate is it.  I plead innocent to the charge of my tone being condescending or putting you down, the most negative interpretation of my comments possible.  I disagreed with some of your comments directed at men.  Those comments drew praise from the sisterhood but I can assure you most SDs here would have just rolled their eyes in a \"here we go again\" moment.\n\n>That\u2019s too bad. It\u2019s an important topic, and I don\u2019t plan on sitting here quietly.\n\nAgree that rape is an important topic.  Never suggested otherwise but it's an explosive topic that stirs strong emotions and a topic in its own right.  Preach to the converted if you must but as I said, the perpetrators of such violence are not listening here.  I dare suggest that most SDs who participate in this forum do not condone rape. If you actually encounter a man who downplays rape, heap all the scorn on him he deservers.\n\nOf course you're under no obligation to engage with me but I appreciate that you have.  We agree on much more than we disagree.  I don't like wasting energy either so don't post often here.  Your female lens on sugaring is just that, a female perspective.  If you really want to know what men think about such topics then be open to the response and give the respondent the benefit of the doubt.  I was not \"arguing\" with you, we were having a discussion about some of the views expressed in your post that I thought were gratuitous advice to men that participate in this sub.",

                                    "body": "My post was about far more than rape. I was not preaching or lecturing; I was making several valid points and clearly delving into the details regarding those points. Men/SDs that perpetrate the issues I presented are obviously not my targeted audience, as I\u2019d never expect my words to change the fact that they\u2019re rude/willfully ignorant/misogynistic/sociopathic/narcissistic/rapists (in order of ascending severity). The purpose was for good, honest SDs to read and comprehend, in a post about these issues that wasn\u2019t also relentlessly bashing men/blaming them for all the world\u2019s problems, what we, as SBs, risk and face on a daily basis in the bowl. I intended to stir some compassion and understanding from those that might not have considered things in quite the light I\u2019d explained them, which I feel I succeeded in doing. I\u2019m sure I also provoked thought, in the very least, in plenty that didn\u2019t comment to let me know they read all of this. \n\nI am always open to response/discussion. What I am not open to is being told what I meant/what my intentions were; in reading your comments I\u2019ve gotten the (admittedly, self-determined) impression that you were doing both of those things. In addition to that, you do not speak for all men/SDs. You cannot possibly know that the general reaction to much of what I wrote would be eye-rolling/\u201chere we go again.\u201d\n\nYou seem to have missed, in recent history on SLF, comments from men saying things such as, \u201cyou knew the risks,\u201d and worse in response to SBs posting stating their POT had run off after sleeping with them, without leaving the PPM, and other such atrocities. Again, my post addressed far more than rape. \n\nYou also seem to automatically assign \u201cresponsible\u201d as a trait to SLF SDs by default, when it would only make sense to assume, based on all of the reading and conversing I\u2019ve done here, that there are many types of men/SDs lurking in and participating in this forum. The advice you have repeatedly told me was *gratuitous* wasn\u2019t for you, or other SDs like you, to take to heart. It was for others that might not realize what many of us have been through/experienced in the bowl. It was for those skeptics that still have goodness in their hearts to read and take pause, encouraging a thought process they\u2019d perhaps not otherwise have had, and consideration they\u2019d perhaps not had, likewise. In addition to that, for those of you that are already wonderful, safe and trustworthy SDs, seeing stories like these from someone active in the community, that doesn\u2019t bash men or adopt a \u201cfuck all men\u201d attitude, and that often engages in kind/genuine conversation with SDs about a wide array of topics, opens the door to lessening aforementioned skepticism and to more understanding and compassion for specific risks SBs take to be with you. \n\nYou are right, my perspective is that which has a feminine lens. I felt many SDs needed to read a post like this through such a lens; I also wanted to ensure newer/younger SBs knew without a doubt that they aren\u2019t alone, can speak up and deserve to feel safe, even if that means setting boundaries they\u2019ve been told by SDs in the past aren\u2019t \u201cnormal\u201d or make them seem \u201cprudish.\u201d We do agree on a lot. What we disagree on, you seem to be consistent in missing or misunderstanding my explanations of, which is fine. I don\u2019t ever expect to walk away from a conversation having found myself seeing eye to eye on everything discussed with everyone whom I discussed things.",

That sugar babies don't have a leg to stand on if they're taken advantage and have sex in exchange for nothing, because they're not prostitutes and not entitled to the compensation that was previously agreed upon? \n\nIf you are the type of SD who would have sex with an SB knowing she expects a PPM or allowance, and you don't hold up your end of the bargain, that is really really scummy. It would not make your SB a prostitute for expecting to be paid. It would make you guilty of sexual coercion and being a predatory SD who takes advantage of an SB's expectations for his own sexual gratification. I hope to god that if you do have an SB, you don't shame her for having financial expectations in your relationship. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf that is not the point you were trying to make, then I'm not sure why you felt like this was an appropriate time to make that comment. We are talking about rape and really demoralizing and dehumanizing experiences that many women have had. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am so tired of men who clutch their pearls at the thought of \"paying for sex\" and decry the idea of prostitution. If you are ashamed that there is a financial component to your SR, then perhaps vanilla dating is a better option. The idea that SBs expect financial compensation in an intimate relationship should not offend you. It's meant to be a mutually beneficial exchange, and typically in SRs that exchange is intimacy for financial benefit (and hopefully additionally mutual respect, genuine connection and fondness, and maybe even love, depending on the SR and the preferences of the parties involved).",

It needs continuous reform for sure and no doubt contributes to the unwillingness of women to bring charges. However, it's a very serious allegation that can destroy a man's life, the presumption of innocence until proven guilty must be the guiding principle.  False allegation happens more often than you suggest.\n\n>I\u2019m not here to argue or be put down; I\u2019m only interested in genuinely interested/constructive discussion/debate.\n\nIf by constructive discussion/debate you mean primarily engaging with people who praise or agree with you that's not really engaging in debate is it.  I plead innocent to the charge of my tone being condescending or putting you down, the most negative interpretation of my comments possible.  I disagreed with some of your comments directed at men.  Those comments drew praise from the sisterhood but I can assure you most SDs here would have just rolled their eyes in a \"here we go again\" moment.\n\n>That\u2019s too bad. It\u2019s an important topic, and I don\u2019t plan on sitting here quietly.\n\nAgree that rape is an important topic.  Never suggested otherwise but it's an explosive topic that stirs strong emotions and a topic in its own right.  Preach to the converted if you must but as I said, the perpetrators of such violence are not listening here.  I dare suggest that most SDs who participate in this forum do not condone rape. If you actually encounter a man who downplays rape, heap all the scorn on him he deservers.\n\nOf course you're under no obligation to engage with me but I appreciate that you have.  We agree on much more than we disagree.  I don't like wasting energy either so don't post often here.  Your female lens on sugaring is just that, a female perspective.  If you really want to know what men think about such topics then be open to the response and give the respondent the benefit of the doubt.  I was not \"arguing\" with you, we were having a discussion about some of the views expressed in your post that I thought were gratuitous advice to men that participate in this sub.",

                            "body": "My post was about far more than rape. I was not preaching or lecturing; I was making several valid points and clearly delving into the details regarding those points. Men/SDs that perpetrate the issues I presented are obviously not my targeted audience, as I\u2019d never expect my words to change the fact that they\u2019re rude/willfully ignorant/misogynistic/sociopathic/narcissistic/rapists (in order of ascending severity). The purpose was for good, honest SDs to read and comprehend, in a post about these issues that wasn\u2019t also relentlessly bashing men/blaming them for all the world\u2019s problems, what we, as SBs, risk and face on a daily basis in the bowl. I intended to stir some compassion and understanding from those that might not have considered things in quite the light I\u2019d explained them, which I feel I succeeded in doing. I\u2019m sure I also provoked thought, in the very least, in plenty that didn\u2019t comment to let me know they read all of this. \n\nI am always open to response/discussion. What I am not open to is being told what I meant/what my intentions were; in reading your comments I\u2019ve gotten the (admittedly, self-determined) impression that you were doing both of those things. In addition to that, you do not speak for all men/SDs. You cannot possibly know that the general reaction to much of what I wrote would be eye-rolling/\u201chere we go again.\u201d\n\nYou seem to have missed, in recent history on SLF, comments from men saying things such as, \u201cyou knew the risks,\u201d and worse in response to SBs posting stating their POT had run off after sleeping with them, without leaving the PPM, and other such atrocities. Again, my post addressed far more than rape. \n\nYou also seem to automatically assign \u201cresponsible\u201d as a trait to SLF SDs by default, when it would only make sense to assume, based on all of the reading and conversing I\u2019ve done here, that there are many types of men/SDs lurking in and participating in this forum. The advice you have repeatedly told me was *gratuitous* wasn\u2019t for you, or other SDs like you, to take to heart. It was for others that might not realize what many of us have been through/experienced in the bowl. It was for those skeptics that still have goodness in their hearts to read and take pause, encouraging a thought process they\u2019d perhaps not otherwise have had, and consideration they\u2019d perhaps not had, likewise. In addition to that, for those of you that are already wonderful, safe and trustworthy SDs, seeing stories like these from someone active in the community, that doesn\u2019t bash men or adopt a \u201cfuck all men\u201d attitude, and that often engages in kind/genuine conversation with SDs about a wide array of topics, opens the door to lessening aforementioned skepticism and to more understanding and compassion for specific risks SBs take to be with you. \n\nYou are right, my perspective is that which has a feminine lens. I felt many SDs needed to read a post like this through such a lens; I also wanted to ensure newer/younger SBs knew without a doubt that they aren\u2019t alone, can speak up and deserve to feel safe, even if that means setting boundaries they\u2019ve been told by SDs in the past aren\u2019t \u201cnormal\u201d or make them seem \u201cprudish.\u201d We do agree on a lot. What we disagree on, you seem to be consistent in missing or misunderstanding my explanations of, which is fine. I don\u2019t ever expect to walk away from a conversation having found myself seeing eye to eye on everything discussed with everyone whom I discussed things.",

If the relationship does not work out because of unpredicted external factors (ie it turns out we are not compatible) then that's fine.

            "body": ">Do you realize that the vast majority of victims never get the privilege of seeing their day in court, and far fewer see a conviction? That doesn\u2019t negate the fact that in comparison to the number of allegations proven to be false, insanely more (63%) are never even reported and are 100% true. Statistics cite that as few as 2% of allegations are false. The likelihood of a story you read about a woman\u2019s (or man\u2019s) assault/rape being true is much, much higher than anything else.\n\nAgree that the legal system is slow, cumbersome and harsh with respect to the victim. It needs continuous reform for sure and no doubt contributes to the unwillingness of women to bring charges. However, it's a very serious allegation that can destroy a man's life, the presumption of innocence until proven guilty must be the guiding principle.  False allegation happens more often than you suggest.\n\n>I\u2019m not here to argue or be put down; I\u2019m only interested in genuinely interested/constructive discussion/debate.\n\nIf by constructive discussion/debate you mean primarily engaging with people who praise or agree with you that's not really engaging in debate is it.  I plead innocent to the charge of my tone being condescending or putting you down, the most negative interpretation of my comments possible.  I disagreed with some of your comments directed at men.  Those comments drew praise from the sisterhood but I can assure you most SDs here would have just rolled their eyes in a \"here we go again\" moment.\n\n>That\u2019s too bad. It\u2019s an important topic, and I don\u2019t plan on sitting here quietly.\n\nAgree that rape is an important topic.  Never suggested otherwise but it's an explosive topic that stirs strong emotions and a topic in its own right.  Preach to the converted if you must but as I said, the perpetrators of such violence are not listening here.  I dare suggest that most SDs who participate in this forum do not condone rape. If you actually encounter a man who downplays rape, heap all the scorn on him he deservers.\n\nOf course you're under no obligation to engage with me but I appreciate that you have.  We agree on much more than we disagree.  I don't like wasting energy either so don't post often here.  Your female lens on sugaring is just that, a female perspective.  If you really want to know what men think about such topics then be open to the response and give the respondent the benefit of the doubt.  I was not \"arguing\" with you, we were having a discussion about some of the views expressed in your post that I thought were gratuitous advice to men that participate in this sub.",

                    "body": "My post was about far more than rape. I was not preaching or lecturing; I was making several valid points and clearly delving into the details regarding those points. Men/SDs that perpetrate the issues I presented are obviously not my targeted audience, as I\u2019d never expect my words to change the fact that they\u2019re rude/willfully ignorant/misogynistic/sociopathic/narcissistic/rapists (in order of ascending severity). The purpose was for good, honest SDs to read and comprehend, in a post about these issues that wasn\u2019t also relentlessly bashing men/blaming them for all the world\u2019s problems, what we, as SBs, risk and face on a daily basis in the bowl. I intended to stir some compassion and understanding from those that might not have considered things in quite the light I\u2019d explained them, which I feel I succeeded in doing. I\u2019m sure I also provoked thought, in the very least, in plenty that didn\u2019t comment to let me know they read all of this. \n\nI am always open to response/discussion. What I am not open to is being told what I meant/what my intentions were; in reading your comments I\u2019ve gotten the (admittedly, self-determined) impression that you were doing both of those things. In addition to that, you do not speak for all men/SDs. You cannot possibly know that the general reaction to much of what I wrote would be eye-rolling/\u201chere we go again.\u201d\n\nYou seem to have missed, in recent history on SLF, comments from men saying things such as, \u201cyou knew the risks,\u201d and worse in response to SBs posting stating their POT had run off after sleeping with them, without leaving the PPM, and other such atrocities. Again, my post addressed far more than rape. \n\nYou also seem to automatically assign \u201cresponsible\u201d as a trait to SLF SDs by default, when it would only make sense to assume, based on all of the reading and conversing I\u2019ve done here, that there are many types of men/SDs lurking in and participating in this forum. The advice you have repeatedly told me was *gratuitous* wasn\u2019t for you, or other SDs like you, to take to heart. It was for others that might not realize what many of us have been through/experienced in the bowl. It was for those skeptics that still have goodness in their hearts to read and take pause, encouraging a thought process they\u2019d perhaps not otherwise have had, and consideration they\u2019d perhaps not had, likewise. In addition to that, for those of you that are already wonderful, safe and trustworthy SDs, seeing stories like these from someone active in the community, that doesn\u2019t bash men or adopt a \u201cfuck all men\u201d attitude, and that often engages in kind/genuine conversation with SDs about a wide array of topics, opens the door to lessening aforementioned skepticism and to more understanding and compassion for specific risks SBs take to be with you. \n\nYou are right, my perspective is that which has a feminine lens. I felt many SDs needed to read a post like this through such a lens; I also wanted to ensure newer/younger SBs knew without a doubt that they aren\u2019t alone, can speak up and deserve to feel safe, even if that means setting boundaries they\u2019ve been told by SDs in the past aren\u2019t \u201cnormal\u201d or make them seem \u201cprudish.\u201d We do agree on a lot. What we disagree on, you seem to be consistent in missing or misunderstanding my explanations of, which is fine. I don\u2019t ever expect to walk away from a conversation having found myself seeing eye to eye on everything discussed with everyone whom I discussed things.",

            "body": "My post was about far more than rape. I was not preaching or lecturing; I was making several valid points and clearly delving into the details regarding those points. Men/SDs that perpetrate the issues I presented are obviously not my targeted audience, as I\u2019d never expect my words to change the fact that they\u2019re rude/willfully ignorant/misogynistic/sociopathic/narcissistic/rapists (in order of ascending severity). The purpose was for good, honest SDs to read and comprehend, in a post about these issues that wasn\u2019t also relentlessly bashing men/blaming them for all the world\u2019s problems, what we, as SBs, risk and face on a daily basis in the bowl. I intended to stir some compassion and understanding from those that might not have considered things in quite the light I\u2019d explained them, which I feel I succeeded in doing. I\u2019m sure I also provoked thought, in the very least, in plenty that didn\u2019t comment to let me know they read all of this. \n\nI am always open to response/discussion. What I am not open to is being told what I meant/what my intentions were; in reading your comments I\u2019ve gotten the (admittedly, self-determined) impression that you were doing both of those things. In addition to that, you do not speak for all men/SDs. You cannot possibly know that the general reaction to much of what I wrote would be eye-rolling/\u201chere we go again.\u201d\n\nYou seem to have missed, in recent history on SLF, comments from men saying things such as, \u201cyou knew the risks,\u201d and worse in response to SBs posting stating their POT had run off after sleeping with them, without leaving the PPM, and other such atrocities. Again, my post addressed far more than rape. \n\nYou also seem to automatically assign \u201cresponsible\u201d as a trait to SLF SDs by default, when it would only make sense to assume, based on all of the reading and conversing I\u2019ve done here, that there are many types of men/SDs lurking in and participating in this forum. The advice you have repeatedly told me was *gratuitous* wasn\u2019t for you, or other SDs like you, to take to heart. It was for others that might not realize what many of us have been through/experienced in the bowl. It was for those skeptics that still have goodness in their hearts to read and take pause, encouraging a thought process they\u2019d perhaps not otherwise have had, and consideration they\u2019d perhaps not had, likewise. In addition to that, for those of you that are already wonderful, safe and trustworthy SDs, seeing stories like these from someone active in the community, that doesn\u2019t bash men or adopt a \u201cfuck all men\u201d attitude, and that often engages in kind/genuine conversation with SDs about a wide array of topics, opens the door to lessening aforementioned skepticism and to more understanding and compassion for specific risks SBs take to be with you. \n\nYou are right, my perspective is that which has a feminine lens. I felt many SDs needed to read a post like this through such a lens; I also wanted to ensure newer/younger SBs knew without a doubt that they aren\u2019t alone, can speak up and deserve to feel safe, even if that means setting boundaries they\u2019ve been told by SDs in the past aren\u2019t \u201cnormal\u201d or make them seem \u201cprudish.\u201d We do agree on a lot. What we disagree on, you seem to be consistent in missing or misunderstanding my explanations of, which is fine. I don\u2019t ever expect to walk away from a conversation having found myself seeing eye to eye on everything discussed with everyone whom I discussed things.",
