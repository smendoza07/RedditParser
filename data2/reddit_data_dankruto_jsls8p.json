Sakura herself is a Mid-High A-Rank, and we\u2019re explicitly told that the only reason Chiyo wasn\u2019t Kazekage was that she\u2019s so old that it was a genuine possibility that she\u2019d croak at any point. Chiyo in herself pushes the S-Rank boundary, add in Sakura, who via her superior knowledge of poisons and her sheer physical strength who is herself a solid A-Ranker, and they themselves only won because Sasori let them. \n\nAlso, Hidan was kicking Asuma\u2019s ass even without his ritual, literally the only reason Asuma survived for Hidan to pull out the ritual was because Shikamaru bailed him out when Hidan was about to take his head off, and he\u2019s the weakest S-Classer.\n\nAs I said, Gai and Kakashi are temporary S-Classers in Part 1. To give you an idea, in Part 1, Kakashi struggled to follow 5-Gates Lee with his Sharingan, and Kyuubi Naruto is faster than that. And Gai isn\u2019t massively stronger than him.

Don\u2019t forget that even as late as the Ame Infiltration Arc, when both Naruto and Kakashi are solidly S-Class, Tsunade outright says they\u2019re not strong enough to be Hokage. In a war scenario, the Kage\u2019s role in combat is to take out the other Kages and Jinchuurikis, which Gai wouldn\u2019t be able to do in that space without going 7 or 8 gates, and even then 7 Gates was only enough to beat Kisame because Gai is basically the Anti-Kisame. Any of the big three Kage would\u2019ve beaten 7 Gates Gai. And depending on the timeline of Yagura\u2019s death, he was most likely still Mizukage at the time, meaning 3 of 4 foreign Kage would beat or outlast Gai. Throw in factors like age, experience, intelligence.\n\nFurther, don\u2019t forget the main qualification for 5th Hokage is \u201ccould beat or match Orochimaru\u201d, which Kakashi and Gai definitely couldn\u2019t, Gai would\u2019ve needed 7 gates just to not get his ass whooped, but Orochimaru is a famously slippery fucker who wouldn\u2019t have died in the time Gai had before his body gave out.\n\nHell, Post-Pain Naruto wasn\u2019t even a 6th Hokage candidate, and he would\u2019ve fed both Kakashi and Danzou each other\u2019s spleens in Sage Mode, goes to show how important base level strength is to being Hokage.\n\nYou severely underestimate how much Kakashi and Gai grew in the time gap. Don\u2019t forget, Part 1 Kakashi barely beat Zabuza while rested and with his genin to bail him out. Part 2 Kakashi beat Zabuza and Haku while tired then went on to solo the 7 Swordsman no problem and then keep his Sharingan active for almost 3 consecutive days while spamming ninjutsu that would\u2019ve knocked P1 Kakashi on his ass. And Gai canonically is only stronger than Kakashi in 7th and 8th Gate. You\u2019re looking at their EoS selves, not their barely S-Class on a good day for a minute or so Part 1 selves. And even then Gai only did so well against Kisame because he\u2019s the perfect Anti-Kisame, and he got bailed out repeatedly against a Madara that was dicking around. Gai is the single most overhyped Naruto character, save maybe Minato\n\nFurthermore, S-Class=\\=Kage Level. The Kage Summit Arc makes that insanely clear, when Sasuke, who could\u2019ve handed pretty much any of the Akatsuki reasonably well, promptly gets his shit rocked by each individual Kage and has to be outright bailed out by Zetsu, Obito and Karin.",

I wholeheartedly disagree with your assessment of the series. The bingo book is a list of S-class ninja which Kakashi was a part of. Zabuza was also a part of that. Kakashi, I agree did grow in that 3 year period, but he didn\u2019t grow from jonin to S-class. He grew from S-class to kage level. \n\u201cFurthermore\u201d no one could take down orochimaru fully due to his curse marks around and split dna lurking in the world like Horcrux from Harry Potter. His base body though could be defeated by Guy. In fact I think if you\u2019re looking at the Hiruzen vs Oro fight which was to the death for the hokage, Guy would have been able to actually take down Orochimaru if it meant he was to sacrifice his own life in the process like Hiruzen did.

It\u2019s a one and done boost.\n\nYou said Kakashi was jounin when I named him A-Rank. He\u2019s higher than Jounin, significantly lower than Kage.\n\nJust a reminder, the gap between Jounin and Kage is enough that 10,000 Jounin only beat a Kage through sheer attrition.",

And my point to Guy vs Orochimaru was that given he has to have the same fate as Hiruzen, who died attacking Orochimaru, he would have done better. I wasn\u2019t sayin he\u2019s Kage, but he\u2019s definitely S class. And Kakashi and guy could take on essentially any jonin and many of them in base form. Kakashi alone was famous in every country across the world and was feared by all. He\u2019s S class. Even the Kages across the nations have different power scales so S class doesn\u2019t mean Kage, but to be Kage you definitely need to be an S class. War arc Naruto was hands down S class with all his buffs, but he lacked maturity and leadership to be Kage yet. And as far as Guy in part 2 I didn\u2019t notice a significant boost to his skills from part 1. Even with Kakashi the only bump was his MS. The young kids definitely matured but the adults not as much. You didn\u2019t see the akatsuki members in teasin all that much either. Kage Kakashi would lose to part 1 Kakashi and part 2 Kakashi. I think there\u2019s a lot more S class ninja than what you would consider. Kakashi is a man who if he was a missing-nin and attacked the village it would be a threat the Kage would need to assess. Who do you even consider S class besides the akatsuki and active Kages?",

He\u2019s still barely Kage level.\n\nThe only chance Gai has to take out Orochimaru is to do something to prevent him from just using his absolutely bullshit regen. It would literally be Gai vs Madara again. He can do all the damage he likes, Oro would just regen it. Hiruzen only got a Pyrrhic victory that Oro couldn\u2019t regen via directly attacking his soul.\n\nIf you seriously think the major jump between Kakashi in P1 to P2 was Mangekyo, you definitely need to do a reread. As I said, Kakashi goes from nearly losing to Zabuza while rested, to soloing the 7 Ninja Swordsman while tired and injured, still using a base Sharingan, and then maintaining his Mangekyo for almost 2 whole days against Obito and Madara while spamming high level Ninjutsu and keeping pace with Gai in 6 Gates. \n\nYou can be A-Rank and still feared. Zabuza was. Sasuke was famous even before he was B-Rank. \n\nLike, throw P1 Kakashi against any of the Akatsuki and he\u2019d be crushed. And considering Gai is his equal when not using 7 or 8 in both P1 and P2, it\u2019s the same for him.\n\nThe number of S-Classers outside of Akatsuki or Kages  can be counted on a few hands. Darui, B, Naruto after Kakazu (also Naruto when Shippuden starts, but we\u2019re talking base Naruto here), Sasuke after beating Orochimaru, War Arc Sakura, Kabuto after he starts injecting himself with Oro\u2019s genes. Shippuden Gai and Kakashi. Jiraiya, obviously. I\u2019d probably say that Suigetsu is an S-Classer based on his showings against B and Kisame. Yugito should be, based on our understanding of what it takes to tame a Bijuu, but she got absolutely jobbed by Hidan and Kakazu so I would be hesitant to say she is. Danzou is when using all his buffs, but barely. Iwa has Kurotsuchi in Part 2. You\u2019ll notice they\u2019re all either Kage, future Kage or Kage candidates. It\u2019s honestly something like 1 S-Classer per 15,000 Shinobi or some shit.\n\nKakashi\u2019s good, but Part 1 Kakashi would pretty much just be considered a free Sharingan if he ever went rogue.",

Then he can\u2019t move until he gets medical attention.\n\nAlso, people heavily underestimate early Shippuden Team 7. Naruto and Sasuke are high A-Rank in base, and with Curse Seal and Kurama make their way into low S-Class and mid S-Class respectively. Sakura herself is a Mid-High A-Rank, and we\u2019re explicitly told that the only reason Chiyo wasn\u2019t Kazekage was that she\u2019s so old that it was a genuine possibility that she\u2019d croak at any point. Chiyo in herself pushes the S-Rank boundary, add in Sakura, who via her superior knowledge of poisons and her sheer physical strength who is herself a solid A-Ranker, and they themselves only won because Sasori let them. \n\nAlso, Hidan was kicking Asuma\u2019s ass even without his ritual, literally the only reason Asuma survived for Hidan to pull out the ritual was because Shikamaru bailed him out when Hidan was about to take his head off, and he\u2019s the weakest S-Classer.\n\nAs I said, Gai and Kakashi are temporary S-Classers in Part 1. To give you an idea, in Part 1, Kakashi struggled to follow 5-Gates Lee with his Sharingan, and Kyuubi Naruto is faster than that. And Gai isn\u2019t massively stronger than him. That is how big a gap there is between their part 1 and two versions.",

Don\u2019t forget that even as late as the Ame Infiltration Arc, when both Naruto and Kakashi are solidly S-Class, Tsunade outright says they\u2019re not strong enough to be Hokage. In a war scenario, the Kage\u2019s role in combat is to take out the other Kages and Jinchuurikis, which Gai wouldn\u2019t be able to do in that space without going 7 or 8 gates, and even then 7 Gates was only enough to beat Kisame because Gai is basically the Anti-Kisame. Any of the big three Kage would\u2019ve beaten 7 Gates Gai. And depending on the timeline of Yagura\u2019s death, he was most likely still Mizukage at the time, meaning 3 of 4 foreign Kage would beat or outlast Gai. Throw in factors like age, experience, intelligence.\n\nFurther, don\u2019t forget the main qualification for 5th Hokage is \u201ccould beat or match Orochimaru\u201d, which Kakashi and Gai definitely couldn\u2019t, Gai would\u2019ve needed 7 gates just to not get his ass whooped, but Orochimaru is a famously slippery fucker who wouldn\u2019t have died in the time Gai had before his body gave out.\n\nHell, Post-Pain Naruto wasn\u2019t even a 6th Hokage candidate, and he would\u2019ve fed both Kakashi and Danzou each other\u2019s spleens in Sage Mode, goes to show how important base level strength is to being Hokage.\n\nYou severely underestimate how much Kakashi and Gai grew in the time gap. Don\u2019t forget, Part 1 Kakashi barely beat Zabuza while rested and with his genin to bail him out. Part 2 Kakashi beat Zabuza and Haku while tired then went on to solo the 7 Swordsman no problem and then keep his Sharingan active for almost 3 consecutive days while spamming ninjutsu that would\u2019ve knocked P1 Kakashi on his ass. And Gai canonically is only stronger than Kakashi in 7th and 8th Gate. You\u2019re looking at their EoS selves, not their barely S-Class on a good day for a minute or so Part 1 selves. And even then Gai only did so well against Kisame because he\u2019s the perfect Anti-Kisame, and he got bailed out repeatedly against a Madara that was dicking around. Gai is the single most overhyped Naruto character, save maybe Minato\n\nFurthermore, S-Class=\\=Kage Level. The Kage Summit Arc makes that insanely clear, when Sasuke, who could\u2019ve handed pretty much any of the Akatsuki reasonably well, promptly gets his shit rocked by each individual Kage and has to be outright bailed out by Zetsu, Obito and Karin.",

I wholeheartedly disagree with your assessment of the series. The bingo book is a list of S-class ninja which Kakashi was a part of. Zabuza was also a part of that. Kakashi, I agree did grow in that 3 year period, but he didn\u2019t grow from jonin to S-class. He grew from S-class to kage level. \n\u201cFurthermore\u201d no one could take down orochimaru fully due to his curse marks around and split dna lurking in the world like Horcrux from Harry Potter. His base body though could be defeated by Guy. In fact I think if you\u2019re looking at the Hiruzen vs Oro fight which was to the death for the hokage, Guy would have been able to actually take down Orochimaru if it meant he was to sacrifice his own life in the process like Hiruzen did.

Don\u2019t forget, Sasuke was able to blitz 8 Zabuza water clones, meaning Wave Sasuke was at least 15% of Zabuza\u2019s speed and strength. Sasuke\u2019s good. He\u2019s not that good that he\u2019s 15% of an S-Classer. Zabuza\u2019s whole thing was that he was absolutely deadly with Silent Killing and his surprise attacks but ultimately, when Kakashi got him in a position for a frontal battle, Kakashi bodied him.\n\nThe \u201cBingo Book\u201d is completely undefined. Sai had one of people he killed, so I hope you aren\u2019t trying to tell me that kid Sai was S-Class. It just seems to be a record of info on prominent ninja, so Kakashi Hakate, one of only two known Sharingan users, who was definitely a threat to most people would be in it.\n\nAs for Kage level, Kakashi was definitely coming off worse against a blind, exhausted Sasuke, whereas the Kage each nearly killed him separately while he was rested. Hokage Kakashi is by far the weakest Hokage and the weakest Kage of his generation. Probably one of the weakest Kage period.",

And my point to Guy vs Orochimaru was that given he has to have the same fate as Hiruzen, who died attacking Orochimaru, he would have done better. I wasn\u2019t sayin he\u2019s Kage, but he\u2019s definitely S class. And Kakashi and guy could take on essentially any jonin and many of them in base form. Kakashi alone was famous in every country across the world and was feared by all. He\u2019s S class. Even the Kages across the nations have different power scales so S class doesn\u2019t mean Kage, but to be Kage you definitely need to be an S class. War arc Naruto was hands down S class with all his buffs, but he lacked maturity and leadership to be Kage yet. And as far as Guy in part 2 I didn\u2019t notice a significant boost to his skills from part 1. Even with Kakashi the only bump was his MS. The young kids definitely matured but the adults not as much. You didn\u2019t see the akatsuki members in teasin all that much either. Kage Kakashi would lose to part 1 Kakashi and part 2 Kakashi. I think there\u2019s a lot more S class ninja than what you would consider. Kakashi is a man who if he was a missing-nin and attacked the village it would be a threat the Kage would need to assess. Who do you even consider S class besides the akatsuki and active Kages?",

He\u2019s still barely Kage level.\n\nThe only chance Gai has to take out Orochimaru is to do something to prevent him from just using his absolutely bullshit regen. It would literally be Gai vs Madara again. He can do all the damage he likes, Oro would just regen it. Hiruzen only got a Pyrrhic victory that Oro couldn\u2019t regen via directly attacking his soul.\n\nIf you seriously think the major jump between Kakashi in P1 to P2 was Mangekyo, you definitely need to do a reread. As I said, Kakashi goes from nearly losing to Zabuza while rested, to soloing the 7 Ninja Swordsman while tired and injured, still using a base Sharingan, and then maintaining his Mangekyo for almost 2 whole days against Obito and Madara while spamming high level Ninjutsu and keeping pace with Gai in 6 Gates. \n\nYou can be A-Rank and still feared. Zabuza was. Sasuke was famous even before he was B-Rank. \n\nLike, throw P1 Kakashi against any of the Akatsuki and he\u2019d be crushed. And considering Gai is his equal when not using 7 or 8 in both P1 and P2, it\u2019s the same for him.\n\nThe number of S-Classers outside of Akatsuki or Kages  can be counted on a few hands. Darui, B, Naruto after Kakazu (also Naruto when Shippuden starts, but we\u2019re talking base Naruto here), Sasuke after beating Orochimaru, War Arc Sakura, Kabuto after he starts injecting himself with Oro\u2019s genes. Shippuden Gai and Kakashi. Jiraiya, obviously. I\u2019d probably say that Suigetsu is an S-Classer based on his showings against B and Kisame. Yugito should be, based on our understanding of what it takes to tame a Bijuu, but she got absolutely jobbed by Hidan and Kakazu so I would be hesitant to say she is. Danzou is when using all his buffs, but barely. Iwa has Kurotsuchi in Part 2. You\u2019ll notice they\u2019re all either Kage, future Kage or Kage candidates. It\u2019s honestly something like 1 S-Classer per 15,000 Shinobi or some shit.\n\nKakashi\u2019s good, but Part 1 Kakashi would pretty much just be considered a free Sharingan if he ever went rogue.",

The Demon brothers, pretty much everyone during the Konoha Crush. In the Kakashi Gaiden, every single one of the Iwa nin we see who recognises Minato promptly shits their pants. And Minato isn\u2019t even the strongest of the 4 Hokage. He\u2019s number 2 if Hiruzen\u2019s having a bad day. Kakashi didn\u2019t inspire that sort of reaction among the Sound or Sand ninja.\n\nOrochimaru is mildly amused by Kakashi which is impressive, but not enough when you realise the main qualification for 5th Hokage was, \u201cStrong enough that Orochimaru won\u2019t just return to finish the job.\u201d\n\nItachi directly worked with Kakashi according to the Itachi Hiden. It\u2019d be weirder if he didn\u2019t recognise Kakashi.\n\nEven in Part 2, Kakashi doesn\u2019t get the kinds of reactions that Minato did, but that\u2019s mostly because there\u2019s never a fodder ninja around.",

Sakura herself is a Mid-High A-Rank, and we\u2019re explicitly told that the only reason Chiyo wasn\u2019t Kazekage was that she\u2019s so old that it was a genuine possibility that she\u2019d croak at any point. Chiyo in herself pushes the S-Rank boundary, add in Sakura, who via her superior knowledge of poisons and her sheer physical strength who is herself a solid A-Ranker, and they themselves only won because Sasori let them. \n\nAlso, Hidan was kicking Asuma\u2019s ass even without his ritual, literally the only reason Asuma survived for Hidan to pull out the ritual was because Shikamaru bailed him out when Hidan was about to take his head off, and he\u2019s the weakest S-Classer.\n\nAs I said, Gai and Kakashi are temporary S-Classers in Part 1. To give you an idea, in Part 1, Kakashi struggled to follow 5-Gates Lee with his Sharingan, and Kyuubi Naruto is faster than that. And Gai isn\u2019t massively stronger than him.

Don\u2019t forget that even as late as the Ame Infiltration Arc, when both Naruto and Kakashi are solidly S-Class, Tsunade outright says they\u2019re not strong enough to be Hokage. In a war scenario, the Kage\u2019s role in combat is to take out the other Kages and Jinchuurikis, which Gai wouldn\u2019t be able to do in that space without going 7 or 8 gates, and even then 7 Gates was only enough to beat Kisame because Gai is basically the Anti-Kisame. Any of the big three Kage would\u2019ve beaten 7 Gates Gai. And depending on the timeline of Yagura\u2019s death, he was most likely still Mizukage at the time, meaning 3 of 4 foreign Kage would beat or outlast Gai. Throw in factors like age, experience, intelligence.\n\nFurther, don\u2019t forget the main qualification for 5th Hokage is \u201ccould beat or match Orochimaru\u201d, which Kakashi and Gai definitely couldn\u2019t, Gai would\u2019ve needed 7 gates just to not get his ass whooped, but Orochimaru is a famously slippery fucker who wouldn\u2019t have died in the time Gai had before his body gave out.\n\nHell, Post-Pain Naruto wasn\u2019t even a 6th Hokage candidate, and he would\u2019ve fed both Kakashi and Danzou each other\u2019s spleens in Sage Mode, goes to show how important base level strength is to being Hokage.\n\nYou severely underestimate how much Kakashi and Gai grew in the time gap. Don\u2019t forget, Part 1 Kakashi barely beat Zabuza while rested and with his genin to bail him out. Part 2 Kakashi beat Zabuza and Haku while tired then went on to solo the 7 Swordsman no problem and then keep his Sharingan active for almost 3 consecutive days while spamming ninjutsu that would\u2019ve knocked P1 Kakashi on his ass. And Gai canonically is only stronger than Kakashi in 7th and 8th Gate. You\u2019re looking at their EoS selves, not their barely S-Class on a good day for a minute or so Part 1 selves. And even then Gai only did so well against Kisame because he\u2019s the perfect Anti-Kisame, and he got bailed out repeatedly against a Madara that was dicking around. Gai is the single most overhyped Naruto character, save maybe Minato\n\nFurthermore, S-Class=\\=Kage Level. The Kage Summit Arc makes that insanely clear, when Sasuke, who could\u2019ve handed pretty much any of the Akatsuki reasonably well, promptly gets his shit rocked by each individual Kage and has to be outright bailed out by Zetsu, Obito and Karin.",

I wholeheartedly disagree with your assessment of the series. The bingo book is a list of S-class ninja which Kakashi was a part of. Zabuza was also a part of that. Kakashi, I agree did grow in that 3 year period, but he didn\u2019t grow from jonin to S-class. He grew from S-class to kage level. \n\u201cFurthermore\u201d no one could take down orochimaru fully due to his curse marks around and split dna lurking in the world like Horcrux from Harry Potter. His base body though could be defeated by Guy. In fact I think if you\u2019re looking at the Hiruzen vs Oro fight which was to the death for the hokage, Guy would have been able to actually take down Orochimaru if it meant he was to sacrifice his own life in the process like Hiruzen did.

Gai definitely wouldn\u2019t beat Oro\u2019s main body, not with how often he can outright recover from insanely bullshit issues. 1-Tailed Naruto ripped his face off. 4-Tailed Naruto outright ripped him in half and he just put himself back together. Would Gai be stronger than Oro in his higher gates? Absolutely. Would that be enough for him to kill Oro\u2019s body before his own body broke down? Absolutely not.\n\nAnd again, they aren\u2019t looking for someone who would repeat the problem of needing a new Kage in a few weeks.\n\nFurther, Zabuza isn\u2019t S-Class. He\u2019s an A-Ranker. Don\u2019t forget, Sasuke was able to blitz 8 Zabuza water clones, meaning Wave Sasuke was at least 15% of Zabuza\u2019s speed and strength. Sasuke\u2019s good. He\u2019s not that good that he\u2019s 15% of an S-Classer. Zabuza\u2019s whole thing was that he was absolutely deadly with Silent Killing and his surprise attacks but ultimately, when Kakashi got him in a position for a frontal battle, Kakashi bodied him.\n\nThe \u201cBingo Book\u201d is completely undefined. Sai had one of people he killed, so I hope you aren\u2019t trying to tell me that kid Sai was S-Class. It just seems to be a record of info on prominent ninja, so Kakashi Hakate, one of only two known Sharingan users, who was definitely a threat to most people would be in it.\n\nAs for Kage level, Kakashi was definitely coming off worse against a blind, exhausted Sasuke, whereas the Kage each nearly killed him separately while he was rested. Hokage Kakashi is by far the weakest Hokage and the weakest Kage of his generation. Probably one of the weakest Kage period.",

Kakashi alone was famous in every country across the world and was feared by all. He\u2019s S class. Even the Kages across the nations have different power scales so S class doesn\u2019t mean Kage, but to be Kage you definitely need to be an S class. War arc Naruto was hands down S class with all his buffs, but he lacked maturity and leadership to be Kage yet. And as far as Guy in part 2 I didn\u2019t notice a significant boost to his skills from part 1. Even with Kakashi the only bump was his MS. The young kids definitely matured but the adults not as much. You didn\u2019t see the akatsuki members in teasin all that much either. Kage Kakashi would lose to part 1 Kakashi and part 2 Kakashi. I think there\u2019s a lot more S class ninja than what you would consider. Kakashi is a man who if he was a missing-nin and attacked the village it would be a threat the Kage would need to assess.

Hiruzen only got a Pyrrhic victory that Oro couldn\u2019t regen via directly attacking his soul.\n\nIf you seriously think the major jump between Kakashi in P1 to P2 was Mangekyo, you definitely need to do a reread. As I said, Kakashi goes from nearly losing to Zabuza while rested, to soloing the 7 Ninja Swordsman while tired and injured, still using a base Sharingan, and then maintaining his Mangekyo for almost 2 whole days against Obito and Madara while spamming high level Ninjutsu and keeping pace with Gai in 6 Gates. \n\nYou can be A-Rank and still feared. Zabuza was. Sasuke was famous even before he was B-Rank. \n\nLike, throw P1 Kakashi against any of the Akatsuki and he\u2019d be crushed. And considering Gai is his equal when not using 7 or 8 in both P1 and P2, it\u2019s the same for him.\n\nThe number of S-Classers outside of Akatsuki or Kages  can be counted on a few hands. Darui, B, Naruto after Kakazu (also Naruto when Shippuden starts, but we\u2019re talking base Naruto here), Sasuke after beating Orochimaru, War Arc Sakura, Kabuto after he starts injecting himself with Oro\u2019s genes. Shippuden Gai and Kakashi. Jiraiya, obviously. I\u2019d probably say that Suigetsu is an S-Classer based on his showings against B and Kisame. Yugito should be, based on our understanding of what it takes to tame a Bijuu, but she got absolutely jobbed by Hidan and Kakazu so I would be hesitant to say she is. Danzou is when using all his buffs, but barely. Iwa has Kurotsuchi in Part 2. You\u2019ll notice they\u2019re all either Kage, future Kage or Kage candidates. It\u2019s honestly something like 1 S-Classer per 15,000 Shinobi or some shit.\n\nKakashi\u2019s good, but Part 1 Kakashi would pretty much just be considered a free Sharingan if he ever went rogue.",

Sakura herself is a Mid-High A-Rank, and we\u2019re explicitly told that the only reason Chiyo wasn\u2019t Kazekage was that she\u2019s so old that it was a genuine possibility that she\u2019d croak at any point. Chiyo in herself pushes the S-Rank boundary, add in Sakura, who via her superior knowledge of poisons and her sheer physical strength who is herself a solid A-Ranker, and they themselves only won because Sasori let them. \n\nAlso, Hidan was kicking Asuma\u2019s ass even without his ritual, literally the only reason Asuma survived for Hidan to pull out the ritual was because Shikamaru bailed him out when Hidan was about to take his head off, and he\u2019s the weakest S-Classer.\n\nAs I said, Gai and Kakashi are temporary S-Classers in Part 1. To give you an idea, in Part 1, Kakashi struggled to follow 5-Gates Lee with his Sharingan, and Kyuubi Naruto is faster than that. And Gai isn\u2019t massively stronger than him. That is how big a gap there is between their part 1 and two versions.",

Don\u2019t forget that even as late as the Ame Infiltration Arc, when both Naruto and Kakashi are solidly S-Class, Tsunade outright says they\u2019re not strong enough to be Hokage. In a war scenario, the Kage\u2019s role in combat is to take out the other Kages and Jinchuurikis, which Gai wouldn\u2019t be able to do in that space without going 7 or 8 gates, and even then 7 Gates was only enough to beat Kisame because Gai is basically the Anti-Kisame. Any of the big three Kage would\u2019ve beaten 7 Gates Gai. And depending on the timeline of Yagura\u2019s death, he was most likely still Mizukage at the time, meaning 3 of 4 foreign Kage would beat or outlast Gai. Throw in factors like age, experience, intelligence.\n\nFurther, don\u2019t forget the main qualification for 5th Hokage is \u201ccould beat or match Orochimaru\u201d, which Kakashi and Gai definitely couldn\u2019t, Gai would\u2019ve needed 7 gates just to not get his ass whooped, but Orochimaru is a famously slippery fucker who wouldn\u2019t have died in the time Gai had before his body gave out.\n\nHell, Post-Pain Naruto wasn\u2019t even a 6th Hokage candidate, and he would\u2019ve fed both Kakashi and Danzou each other\u2019s spleens in Sage Mode, goes to show how important base level strength is to being Hokage.\n\nYou severely underestimate how much Kakashi and Gai grew in the time gap. Don\u2019t forget, Part 1 Kakashi barely beat Zabuza while rested and with his genin to bail him out. Part 2 Kakashi beat Zabuza and Haku while tired then went on to solo the 7 Swordsman no problem and then keep his Sharingan active for almost 3 consecutive days while spamming ninjutsu that would\u2019ve knocked P1 Kakashi on his ass. And Gai canonically is only stronger than Kakashi in 7th and 8th Gate. You\u2019re looking at their EoS selves, not their barely S-Class on a good day for a minute or so Part 1 selves. And even then Gai only did so well against Kisame because he\u2019s the perfect Anti-Kisame, and he got bailed out repeatedly against a Madara that was dicking around. Gai is the single most overhyped Naruto character, save maybe Minato\n\nFurthermore, S-Class=\\=Kage Level. The Kage Summit Arc makes that insanely clear, when Sasuke, who could\u2019ve handed pretty much any of the Akatsuki reasonably well, promptly gets his shit rocked by each individual Kage and has to be outright bailed out by Zetsu, Obito and Karin.",

I wholeheartedly disagree with your assessment of the series. The bingo book is a list of S-class ninja which Kakashi was a part of. Zabuza was also a part of that. Kakashi, I agree did grow in that 3 year period, but he didn\u2019t grow from jonin to S-class. He grew from S-class to kage level. \n\u201cFurthermore\u201d no one could take down orochimaru fully due to his curse marks around and split dna lurking in the world like Horcrux from Harry Potter. His base body though could be defeated by Guy. In fact I think if you\u2019re looking at the Hiruzen vs Oro fight which was to the death for the hokage, Guy would have been able to actually take down Orochimaru if it meant he was to sacrifice his own life in the process like Hiruzen did.

Would Gai be stronger than Oro in his higher gates? Absolutely. Would that be enough for him to kill Oro\u2019s body before his own body broke down? Absolutely not.\n\nAnd again, they aren\u2019t looking for someone who would repeat the problem of needing a new Kage in a few weeks.\n\nFurther, Zabuza isn\u2019t S-Class. He\u2019s an A-Ranker. Don\u2019t forget, Sasuke was able to blitz 8 Zabuza water clones, meaning Wave Sasuke was at least 15% of Zabuza\u2019s speed and strength. Sasuke\u2019s good. He\u2019s not that good that he\u2019s 15% of an S-Classer. Zabuza\u2019s whole thing was that he was absolutely deadly with Silent Killing and his surprise attacks but ultimately, when Kakashi got him in a position for a frontal battle, Kakashi bodied him.\n\nThe \u201cBingo Book\u201d is completely undefined. Sai had one of people he killed, so I hope you aren\u2019t trying to tell me that kid Sai was S-Class. It just seems to be a record of info on prominent ninja, so Kakashi Hakate, one of only two known Sharingan users, who was definitely a threat to most people would be in it.\n\nAs for Kage level, Kakashi was definitely coming off worse against a blind, exhausted Sasuke, whereas the Kage each nearly killed him separately while he was rested. Hokage Kakashi is by far the weakest Hokage and the weakest Kage of his generation. Probably one of the weakest Kage period.",

I wasn\u2019t sayin he\u2019s Kage, but he\u2019s definitely S class. And Kakashi and guy could take on essentially any jonin and many of them in base form. Kakashi alone was famous in every country across the world and was feared by all. He\u2019s S class. Even the Kages across the nations have different power scales so S class doesn\u2019t mean Kage, but to be Kage you definitely need to be an S class. War arc Naruto was hands down S class with all his buffs, but he lacked maturity and leadership to be Kage yet. And as far as Guy in part 2 I didn\u2019t notice a significant boost to his skills from part 1. Even with Kakashi the only bump was his MS. The young kids definitely matured but the adults not as much. You didn\u2019t see the akatsuki members in teasin all that much either. Kage Kakashi would lose to part 1 Kakashi and part 2 Kakashi. I think there\u2019s a lot more S class ninja than what you would consider. Kakashi is a man who if he was a missing-nin and attacked the village it would be a threat the Kage would need to assess.

Hiruzen only got a Pyrrhic victory that Oro couldn\u2019t regen via directly attacking his soul.\n\nIf you seriously think the major jump between Kakashi in P1 to P2 was Mangekyo, you definitely need to do a reread. As I said, Kakashi goes from nearly losing to Zabuza while rested, to soloing the 7 Ninja Swordsman while tired and injured, still using a base Sharingan, and then maintaining his Mangekyo for almost 2 whole days against Obito and Madara while spamming high level Ninjutsu and keeping pace with Gai in 6 Gates. \n\nYou can be A-Rank and still feared. Zabuza was. Sasuke was famous even before he was B-Rank. \n\nLike, throw P1 Kakashi against any of the Akatsuki and he\u2019d be crushed. And considering Gai is his equal when not using 7 or 8 in both P1 and P2, it\u2019s the same for him.\n\nThe number of S-Classers outside of Akatsuki or Kages  can be counted on a few hands. Darui, B, Naruto after Kakazu (also Naruto when Shippuden starts, but we\u2019re talking base Naruto here), Sasuke after beating Orochimaru, War Arc Sakura, Kabuto after he starts injecting himself with Oro\u2019s genes. Shippuden Gai and Kakashi. Jiraiya, obviously. I\u2019d probably say that Suigetsu is an S-Classer based on his showings against B and Kisame. Yugito should be, based on our understanding of what it takes to tame a Bijuu, but she got absolutely jobbed by Hidan and Kakazu so I would be hesitant to say she is. Danzou is when using all his buffs, but barely. Iwa has Kurotsuchi in Part 2. You\u2019ll notice they\u2019re all either Kage, future Kage or Kage candidates. It\u2019s honestly something like 1 S-Classer per 15,000 Shinobi or some shit.\n\nKakashi\u2019s good, but Part 1 Kakashi would pretty much just be considered a free Sharingan if he ever went rogue.",

Sakura herself is a Mid-High A-Rank, and we\u2019re explicitly told that the only reason Chiyo wasn\u2019t Kazekage was that she\u2019s so old that it was a genuine possibility that she\u2019d croak at any point. Chiyo in herself pushes the S-Rank boundary, add in Sakura, who via her superior knowledge of poisons and her sheer physical strength who is herself a solid A-Ranker, and they themselves only won because Sasori let them. \n\nAlso, Hidan was kicking Asuma\u2019s ass even without his ritual, literally the only reason Asuma survived for Hidan to pull out the ritual was because Shikamaru bailed him out when Hidan was about to take his head off, and he\u2019s the weakest S-Classer.\n\nAs I said, Gai and Kakashi are temporary S-Classers in Part 1. To give you an idea, in Part 1, Kakashi struggled to follow 5-Gates Lee with his Sharingan, and Kyuubi Naruto is faster than that. And Gai isn\u2019t massively stronger than him.

Don\u2019t forget that even as late as the Ame Infiltration Arc, when both Naruto and Kakashi are solidly S-Class, Tsunade outright says they\u2019re not strong enough to be Hokage. In a war scenario, the Kage\u2019s role in combat is to take out the other Kages and Jinchuurikis, which Gai wouldn\u2019t be able to do in that space without going 7 or 8 gates, and even then 7 Gates was only enough to beat Kisame because Gai is basically the Anti-Kisame. Any of the big three Kage would\u2019ve beaten 7 Gates Gai. And depending on the timeline of Yagura\u2019s death, he was most likely still Mizukage at the time, meaning 3 of 4 foreign Kage would beat or outlast Gai. Throw in factors like age, experience, intelligence.\n\nFurther, don\u2019t forget the main qualification for 5th Hokage is \u201ccould beat or match Orochimaru\u201d, which Kakashi and Gai definitely couldn\u2019t, Gai would\u2019ve needed 7 gates just to not get his ass whooped, but Orochimaru is a famously slippery fucker who wouldn\u2019t have died in the time Gai had before his body gave out.\n\nHell, Post-Pain Naruto wasn\u2019t even a 6th Hokage candidate, and he would\u2019ve fed both Kakashi and Danzou each other\u2019s spleens in Sage Mode, goes to show how important base level strength is to being Hokage.\n\nYou severely underestimate how much Kakashi and Gai grew in the time gap. Don\u2019t forget, Part 1 Kakashi barely beat Zabuza while rested and with his genin to bail him out. Part 2 Kakashi beat Zabuza and Haku while tired then went on to solo the 7 Swordsman no problem and then keep his Sharingan active for almost 3 consecutive days while spamming ninjutsu that would\u2019ve knocked P1 Kakashi on his ass. And Gai canonically is only stronger than Kakashi in 7th and 8th Gate. You\u2019re looking at their EoS selves, not their barely S-Class on a good day for a minute or so Part 1 selves. And even then Gai only did so well against Kisame because he\u2019s the perfect Anti-Kisame, and he got bailed out repeatedly against a Madara that was dicking around. Gai is the single most overhyped Naruto character, save maybe Minato\n\nFurthermore, S-Class=\\=Kage Level. The Kage Summit Arc makes that insanely clear, when Sasuke, who could\u2019ve handed pretty much any of the Akatsuki reasonably well, promptly gets his shit rocked by each individual Kage and has to be outright bailed out by Zetsu, Obito and Karin.",

I wholeheartedly disagree with your assessment of the series. The bingo book is a list of S-class ninja which Kakashi was a part of. Zabuza was also a part of that. Kakashi, I agree did grow in that 3 year period, but he didn\u2019t grow from jonin to S-class. He grew from S-class to kage level. \n\u201cFurthermore\u201d no one could take down orochimaru fully due to his curse marks around and split dna lurking in the world like Horcrux from Harry Potter. His base body though could be defeated by Guy. In fact I think if you\u2019re looking at the Hiruzen vs Oro fight which was to the death for the hokage, Guy would have been able to actually take down Orochimaru if it meant he was to sacrifice his own life in the process like Hiruzen did.

He\u2019s not that good that he\u2019s 15% of an S-Classer.

Hokage Kakashi is by far the weakest Hokage and the weakest Kage of his generation. Probably one of the weakest Kage period.",

And my point to Guy vs Orochimaru was that given he has to have the same fate as Hiruzen, who died attacking Orochimaru, he would have done better. I wasn\u2019t sayin he\u2019s Kage, but he\u2019s definitely S class. And Kakashi and guy could take on essentially any jonin and many of them in base form. Kakashi alone was famous in every country across the world and was feared by all. He\u2019s S class. Even the Kages across the nations have different power scales so S class doesn\u2019t mean Kage, but to be Kage you definitely need to be an S class. War arc Naruto was hands down S class with all his buffs, but he lacked maturity and leadership to be Kage yet. And as far as Guy in part 2 I didn\u2019t notice a significant boost to his skills from part 1. Even with Kakashi the only bump was his MS. The young kids definitely matured but the adults not as much. You didn\u2019t see the akatsuki members in teasin all that much either. Kage Kakashi would lose to part 1 Kakashi and part 2 Kakashi. I think there\u2019s a lot more S class ninja than what you would consider. Kakashi is a man who if he was a missing-nin and attacked the village it would be a threat the Kage would need to assess. Who do you even consider S class besides the akatsuki and active Kages?",

He\u2019s still barely Kage level.\n\nThe only chance Gai has to take out Orochimaru is to do something to prevent him from just using his absolutely bullshit regen. It would literally be Gai vs Madara again. He can do all the damage he likes, Oro would just regen it. Hiruzen only got a Pyrrhic victory that Oro couldn\u2019t regen via directly attacking his soul.\n\nIf you seriously think the major jump between Kakashi in P1 to P2 was Mangekyo, you definitely need to do a reread. As I said, Kakashi goes from nearly losing to Zabuza while rested, to soloing the 7 Ninja Swordsman while tired and injured, still using a base Sharingan, and then maintaining his Mangekyo for almost 2 whole days against Obito and Madara while spamming high level Ninjutsu and keeping pace with Gai in 6 Gates. \n\nYou can be A-Rank and still feared. Zabuza was. Sasuke was famous even before he was B-Rank. \n\nLike, throw P1 Kakashi against any of the Akatsuki and he\u2019d be crushed. And considering Gai is his equal when not using 7 or 8 in both P1 and P2, it\u2019s the same for him.\n\nThe number of S-Classers outside of Akatsuki or Kages  can be counted on a few hands. Darui, B, Naruto after Kakazu (also Naruto when Shippuden starts, but we\u2019re talking base Naruto here), Sasuke after beating Orochimaru, War Arc Sakura, Kabuto after he starts injecting himself with Oro\u2019s genes. Shippuden Gai and Kakashi. Jiraiya, obviously. I\u2019d probably say that Suigetsu is an S-Classer based on his showings against B and Kisame. Yugito should be, based on our understanding of what it takes to tame a Bijuu, but she got absolutely jobbed by Hidan and Kakazu so I would be hesitant to say she is. Danzou is when using all his buffs, but barely. Iwa has Kurotsuchi in Part 2. You\u2019ll notice they\u2019re all either Kage, future Kage or Kage candidates. It\u2019s honestly something like 1 S-Classer per 15,000 Shinobi or some shit.\n\nKakashi\u2019s good, but Part 1 Kakashi would pretty much just be considered a free Sharingan if he ever went rogue.",

To give you an idea, the absolute weakest S-Classer is Hidan, who basically took on an entire team of A-Rankers, including Asuma, and shrugged it off. \n\nEven Sasori would\u2019ve carved his way through most of Konoha\u2019s Part 1 \u201cElite\u201d, and he only lost cause he both explicitly gave up (and was forced by Kishimoto to hold the idiot ball) and faced someone who knew his move set in Chiyo and his worst counter in Sakura",

Naruto and Sasuke are high A-Rank in base, and with Curse Seal and Kurama make their way into low S-Class and mid S-Class respectively. Sakura herself is a Mid-High A-Rank, and we\u2019re explicitly told that the only reason Chiyo wasn\u2019t Kazekage was that she\u2019s so old that it was a genuine possibility that she\u2019d croak at any point. Chiyo in herself pushes the S-Rank boundary, add in Sakura, who via her superior knowledge of poisons and her sheer physical strength who is herself a solid A-Ranker, and they themselves only won because Sasori let them. \n\nAlso, Hidan was kicking Asuma\u2019s ass even without his ritual, literally the only reason Asuma survived for Hidan to pull out the ritual was because Shikamaru bailed him out when Hidan was about to take his head off, and he\u2019s the weakest S-Classer.\n\nAs I said, Gai and Kakashi are temporary S-Classers in Part 1. To give you an idea, in Part 1, Kakashi struggled to follow 5-Gates Lee with his Sharingan, and Kyuubi Naruto is faster than that. And Gai isn\u2019t massively stronger than him.

Don\u2019t forget that even as late as the Ame Infiltration Arc, when both Naruto and Kakashi are solidly S-Class, Tsunade outright says they\u2019re not strong enough to be Hokage. In a war scenario, the Kage\u2019s role in combat is to take out the other Kages and Jinchuurikis, which Gai wouldn\u2019t be able to do in that space without going 7 or 8 gates, and even then 7 Gates was only enough to beat Kisame because Gai is basically the Anti-Kisame. Any of the big three Kage would\u2019ve beaten 7 Gates Gai. And depending on the timeline of Yagura\u2019s death, he was most likely still Mizukage at the time, meaning 3 of 4 foreign Kage would beat or outlast Gai. Throw in factors like age, experience, intelligence.\n\nFurther, don\u2019t forget the main qualification for 5th Hokage is \u201ccould beat or match Orochimaru\u201d, which Kakashi and Gai definitely couldn\u2019t, Gai would\u2019ve needed 7 gates just to not get his ass whooped, but Orochimaru is a famously slippery fucker who wouldn\u2019t have died in the time Gai had before his body gave out.\n\nHell, Post-Pain Naruto wasn\u2019t even a 6th Hokage candidate, and he would\u2019ve fed both Kakashi and Danzou each other\u2019s spleens in Sage Mode, goes to show how important base level strength is to being Hokage.\n\nYou severely underestimate how much Kakashi and Gai grew in the time gap. Don\u2019t forget, Part 1 Kakashi barely beat Zabuza while rested and with his genin to bail him out. Part 2 Kakashi beat Zabuza and Haku while tired then went on to solo the 7 Swordsman no problem and then keep his Sharingan active for almost 3 consecutive days while spamming ninjutsu that would\u2019ve knocked P1 Kakashi on his ass. And Gai canonically is only stronger than Kakashi in 7th and 8th Gate. You\u2019re looking at their EoS selves, not their barely S-Class on a good day for a minute or so Part 1 selves. And even then Gai only did so well against Kisame because he\u2019s the perfect Anti-Kisame, and he got bailed out repeatedly against a Madara that was dicking around. Gai is the single most overhyped Naruto character, save maybe Minato\n\nFurthermore, S-Class=\\=Kage Level. The Kage Summit Arc makes that insanely clear, when Sasuke, who could\u2019ve handed pretty much any of the Akatsuki reasonably well, promptly gets his shit rocked by each individual Kage and has to be outright bailed out by Zetsu, Obito and Karin.",

I wholeheartedly disagree with your assessment of the series. The bingo book is a list of S-class ninja which Kakashi was a part of. Zabuza was also a part of that. Kakashi, I agree did grow in that 3 year period, but he didn\u2019t grow from jonin to S-class. He grew from S-class to kage level. \n\u201cFurthermore\u201d no one could take down orochimaru fully due to his curse marks around and split dna lurking in the world like Horcrux from Harry Potter. His base body though could be defeated by Guy. In fact I think if you\u2019re looking at the Hiruzen vs Oro fight which was to the death for the hokage, Guy would have been able to actually take down Orochimaru if it meant he was to sacrifice his own life in the process like Hiruzen did.

Would Gai be stronger than Oro in his higher gates? Absolutely. Would that be enough for him to kill Oro\u2019s body before his own body broke down? Absolutely not.\n\nAnd again, they aren\u2019t looking for someone who would repeat the problem of needing a new Kage in a few weeks.\n\nFurther, Zabuza isn\u2019t S-Class. He\u2019s an A-Ranker. Don\u2019t forget, Sasuke was able to blitz 8 Zabuza water clones, meaning Wave Sasuke was at least 15% of Zabuza\u2019s speed and strength. Sasuke\u2019s good. He\u2019s not that good that he\u2019s 15% of an S-Classer. Zabuza\u2019s whole thing was that he was absolutely deadly with Silent Killing and his surprise attacks but ultimately, when Kakashi got him in a position for a frontal battle, Kakashi bodied him.\n\nThe \u201cBingo Book\u201d is completely undefined. Sai had one of people he killed, so I hope you aren\u2019t trying to tell me that kid Sai was S-Class. It just seems to be a record of info on prominent ninja, so Kakashi Hakate, one of only two known Sharingan users, who was definitely a threat to most people would be in it.\n\nAs for Kage level, Kakashi was definitely coming off worse against a blind, exhausted Sasuke, whereas the Kage each nearly killed him separately while he was rested. Hokage Kakashi is by far the weakest Hokage and the weakest Kage of his generation. Probably one of the weakest Kage period.",

I wasn\u2019t sayin he\u2019s Kage, but he\u2019s definitely S class. And Kakashi and guy could take on essentially any jonin and many of them in base form. Kakashi alone was famous in every country across the world and was feared by all. He\u2019s S class. Even the Kages across the nations have different power scales so S class doesn\u2019t mean Kage, but to be Kage you definitely need to be an S class. War arc Naruto was hands down S class with all his buffs, but he lacked maturity and leadership to be Kage yet. And as far as Guy in part 2 I didn\u2019t notice a significant boost to his skills from part 1. Even with Kakashi the only bump was his MS. The young kids definitely matured but the adults not as much. You didn\u2019t see the akatsuki members in teasin all that much either. Kage Kakashi would lose to part 1 Kakashi and part 2 Kakashi. I think there\u2019s a lot more S class ninja than what you would consider. Kakashi is a man who if he was a missing-nin and attacked the village it would be a threat the Kage would need to assess.

He\u2019s still barely Kage level.\n\nThe only chance Gai has to take out Orochimaru is to do something to prevent him from just using his absolutely bullshit regen. It would literally be Gai vs Madara again. He can do all the damage he likes, Oro would just regen it. Hiruzen only got a Pyrrhic victory that Oro couldn\u2019t regen via directly attacking his soul.\n\nIf you seriously think the major jump between Kakashi in P1 to P2 was Mangekyo, you definitely need to do a reread. As I said, Kakashi goes from nearly losing to Zabuza while rested, to soloing the 7 Ninja Swordsman while tired and injured, still using a base Sharingan, and then maintaining his Mangekyo for almost 2 whole days against Obito and Madara while spamming high level Ninjutsu and keeping pace with Gai in 6 Gates. \n\nYou can be A-Rank and still feared. Zabuza was. Sasuke was famous even before he was B-Rank. \n\nLike, throw P1 Kakashi against any of the Akatsuki and he\u2019d be crushed. And considering Gai is his equal when not using 7 or 8 in both P1 and P2, it\u2019s the same for him.\n\nThe number of S-Classers outside of Akatsuki or Kages  can be counted on a few hands. Darui, B, Naruto after Kakazu (also Naruto when Shippuden starts, but we\u2019re talking base Naruto here), Sasuke after beating Orochimaru, War Arc Sakura, Kabuto after he starts injecting himself with Oro\u2019s genes. Shippuden Gai and Kakashi. Jiraiya, obviously. I\u2019d probably say that Suigetsu is an S-Classer based on his showings against B and Kisame. Yugito should be, based on our understanding of what it takes to tame a Bijuu, but she got absolutely jobbed by Hidan and Kakazu so I would be hesitant to say she is. Danzou is when using all his buffs, but barely. Iwa has Kurotsuchi in Part 2. You\u2019ll notice they\u2019re all either Kage, future Kage or Kage candidates. It\u2019s honestly something like 1 S-Classer per 15,000 Shinobi or some shit.\n\nKakashi\u2019s good, but Part 1 Kakashi would pretty much just be considered a free Sharingan if he ever went rogue.",

Chiyo in herself pushes the S-Rank boundary, add in Sakura, who via her superior knowledge of poisons and her sheer physical strength who is herself a solid A-Ranker, and they themselves only won because Sasori let them. \n\nAlso, Hidan was kicking Asuma\u2019s ass even without his ritual, literally the only reason Asuma survived for Hidan to pull out the ritual was because Shikamaru bailed him out when Hidan was about to take his head off, and he\u2019s the weakest S-Classer.\n\nAs I said, Gai and Kakashi are temporary S-Classers in Part 1.

Don\u2019t forget that even as late as the Ame Infiltration Arc, when both Naruto and Kakashi are solidly S-Class, Tsunade outright says they\u2019re not strong enough to be Hokage. In a war scenario, the Kage\u2019s role in combat is to take out the other Kages and Jinchuurikis, which Gai wouldn\u2019t be able to do in that space without going 7 or 8 gates, and even then 7 Gates was only enough to beat Kisame because Gai is basically the Anti-Kisame. Any of the big three Kage would\u2019ve beaten 7 Gates Gai. And depending on the timeline of Yagura\u2019s death, he was most likely still Mizukage at the time, meaning 3 of 4 foreign Kage would beat or outlast Gai. Throw in factors like age, experience, intelligence.\n\nFurther, don\u2019t forget the main qualification for 5th Hokage is \u201ccould beat or match Orochimaru\u201d, which Kakashi and Gai definitely couldn\u2019t, Gai would\u2019ve needed 7 gates just to not get his ass whooped, but Orochimaru is a famously slippery fucker who wouldn\u2019t have died in the time Gai had before his body gave out.\n\nHell, Post-Pain Naruto wasn\u2019t even a 6th Hokage candidate, and he would\u2019ve fed both Kakashi and Danzou each other\u2019s spleens in Sage Mode, goes to show how important base level strength is to being Hokage.\n\nYou severely underestimate how much Kakashi and Gai grew in the time gap. Don\u2019t forget, Part 1 Kakashi barely beat Zabuza while rested and with his genin to bail him out. Part 2 Kakashi beat Zabuza and Haku while tired then went on to solo the 7 Swordsman no problem and then keep his Sharingan active for almost 3 consecutive days while spamming ninjutsu that would\u2019ve knocked P1 Kakashi on his ass. And Gai canonically is only stronger than Kakashi in 7th and 8th Gate. You\u2019re looking at their EoS selves, not their barely S-Class on a good day for a minute or so Part 1 selves. And even then Gai only did so well against Kisame because he\u2019s the perfect Anti-Kisame, and he got bailed out repeatedly against a Madara that was dicking around. Gai is the single most overhyped Naruto character, save maybe Minato\n\nFurthermore, S-Class=\\=Kage Level. The Kage Summit Arc makes that insanely clear, when Sasuke, who could\u2019ve handed pretty much any of the Akatsuki reasonably well, promptly gets his shit rocked by each individual Kage and has to be outright bailed out by Zetsu, Obito and Karin.",

Hidan is the perfect mismatch to any I knowledgeable ninja. And like you said Kakashi beat Zabuza, a rouge S-class ninja in part one. That was his classification. I don\u2019t want to be goin back and forth about this. I wholeheartedly disagree with your assessment of the series. The bingo book is a list of S-class ninja which Kakashi was a part of. Zabuza was also a part of that. Kakashi, I agree did grow in that 3 year period, but he didn\u2019t grow from jonin to S-class. He grew from S-class to kage level. \n\u201cFurthermore\u201d no one could take down orochimaru fully due to his curse marks around and split dna lurking in the world like Horcrux from Harry Potter. His base body though could be defeated by Guy. In fact I think if you\u2019re looking at the Hiruzen vs Oro fight which was to the death for the hokage, Guy would have been able to actually take down Orochimaru if it meant he was to sacrifice his own life in the process like Hiruzen did.

Not A-Rank. \n\nGai and Kakashi are both solid A-Rankers, with spurts as temporary S-Classers when using their buffs. Gai definitely wouldn\u2019t beat Oro\u2019s main body, not with how often he can outright recover from insanely bullshit issues. 1-Tailed Naruto ripped his face off. 4-Tailed Naruto outright ripped him in half and he just put himself back together. Would Gai be stronger than Oro in his higher gates? Absolutely. Would that be enough for him to kill Oro\u2019s body before his own body broke down? Absolutely not.\n\nAnd again, they aren\u2019t looking for someone who would repeat the problem of needing a new Kage in a few weeks.\n\nFurther, Zabuza isn\u2019t S-Class. He\u2019s an A-Ranker. Don\u2019t forget, Sasuke was able to blitz 8 Zabuza water clones, meaning Wave Sasuke was at least 15% of Zabuza\u2019s speed and strength. Sasuke\u2019s good. He\u2019s not that good that he\u2019s 15% of an S-Classer. Zabuza\u2019s whole thing was that he was absolutely deadly with Silent Killing and his surprise attacks but ultimately, when Kakashi got him in a position for a frontal battle, Kakashi bodied him.\n\nThe \u201cBingo Book\u201d is completely undefined. Sai had one of people he killed, so I hope you aren\u2019t trying to tell me that kid Sai was S-Class. It just seems to be a record of info on prominent ninja, so Kakashi Hakate, one of only two known Sharingan users, who was definitely a threat to most people would be in it.\n\nAs for Kage level, Kakashi was definitely coming off worse against a blind, exhausted Sasuke, whereas the Kage each nearly killed him separately while he was rested. Hokage Kakashi is by far the weakest Hokage and the weakest Kage of his generation. Probably one of the weakest Kage period.",

And my point to Guy vs Orochimaru was that given he has to have the same fate as Hiruzen, who died attacking Orochimaru, he would have done better. I wasn\u2019t sayin he\u2019s Kage, but he\u2019s definitely S class. And Kakashi and guy could take on essentially any jonin and many of them in base form. Kakashi alone was famous in every country across the world and was feared by all. He\u2019s S class. Even the Kages across the nations have different power scales so S class doesn\u2019t mean Kage, but to be Kage you definitely need to be an S class. War arc Naruto was hands down S class with all his buffs, but he lacked maturity and leadership to be Kage yet. And as far as Guy in part 2 I didn\u2019t notice a significant boost to his skills from part 1. Even with Kakashi the only bump was his MS. The young kids definitely matured but the adults not as much. You didn\u2019t see the akatsuki members in teasin all that much either. Kage Kakashi would lose to part 1 Kakashi and part 2 Kakashi. I think there\u2019s a lot more S class ninja than what you would consider. Kakashi is a man who if he was a missing-nin and attacked the village it would be a threat the Kage would need to assess. Who do you even consider S class besides the akatsuki and active Kages?",

He\u2019s still barely Kage level.\n\nThe only chance Gai has to take out Orochimaru is to do something to prevent him from just using his absolutely bullshit regen. It would literally be Gai vs Madara again. He can do all the damage he likes, Oro would just regen it. Hiruzen only got a Pyrrhic victory that Oro couldn\u2019t regen via directly attacking his soul.\n\nIf you seriously think the major jump between Kakashi in P1 to P2 was Mangekyo, you definitely need to do a reread. As I said, Kakashi goes from nearly losing to Zabuza while rested, to soloing the 7 Ninja Swordsman while tired and injured, still using a base Sharingan, and then maintaining his Mangekyo for almost 2 whole days against Obito and Madara while spamming high level Ninjutsu and keeping pace with Gai in 6 Gates. \n\nYou can be A-Rank and still feared. Zabuza was. Sasuke was famous even before he was B-Rank. \n\nLike, throw P1 Kakashi against any of the Akatsuki and he\u2019d be crushed. And considering Gai is his equal when not using 7 or 8 in both P1 and P2, it\u2019s the same for him.\n\nThe number of S-Classers outside of Akatsuki or Kages  can be counted on a few hands. Darui, B, Naruto after Kakazu (also Naruto when Shippuden starts, but we\u2019re talking base Naruto here), Sasuke after beating Orochimaru, War Arc Sakura, Kabuto after he starts injecting himself with Oro\u2019s genes. Shippuden Gai and Kakashi. Jiraiya, obviously. I\u2019d probably say that Suigetsu is an S-Classer based on his showings against B and Kisame. Yugito should be, based on our understanding of what it takes to tame a Bijuu, but she got absolutely jobbed by Hidan and Kakazu so I would be hesitant to say she is. Danzou is when using all his buffs, but barely. Iwa has Kurotsuchi in Part 2. You\u2019ll notice they\u2019re all either Kage, future Kage or Kage candidates. It\u2019s honestly something like 1 S-Classer per 15,000 Shinobi or some shit.\n\nKakashi\u2019s good, but Part 1 Kakashi would pretty much just be considered a free Sharingan if he ever went rogue.",

The Demon brothers, pretty much everyone during the Konoha Crush. In the Kakashi Gaiden, every single one of the Iwa nin we see who recognises Minato promptly shits their pants. And Minato isn\u2019t even the strongest of the 4 Hokage. He\u2019s number 2 if Hiruzen\u2019s having a bad day. Kakashi didn\u2019t inspire that sort of reaction among the Sound or Sand ninja.\n\nOrochimaru is mildly amused by Kakashi which is impressive, but not enough when you realise the main qualification for 5th Hokage was, \u201cStrong enough that Orochimaru won\u2019t just return to finish the job.\u201d\n\nItachi directly worked with Kakashi according to the Itachi Hiden. It\u2019d be weirder if he didn\u2019t recognise Kakashi.\n\nEven in Part 2, Kakashi doesn\u2019t get the kinds of reactions that Minato did, but that\u2019s mostly because there\u2019s never a fodder ninja around.",

Chiyo in herself pushes the S-Rank boundary, add in Sakura, who via her superior knowledge of poisons and her sheer physical strength who is herself a solid A-Ranker, and they themselves only won because Sasori let them. \n\nAlso, Hidan was kicking Asuma\u2019s ass even without his ritual, literally the only reason Asuma survived for Hidan to pull out the ritual was because Shikamaru bailed him out when Hidan was about to take his head off, and he\u2019s the weakest S-Classer.\n\nAs I said, Gai and Kakashi are temporary S-Classers in Part 1. To give you an idea, in Part 1, Kakashi struggled to follow 5-Gates Lee with his Sharingan, and Kyuubi Naruto is faster than that. And Gai isn\u2019t massively stronger than him.

Don\u2019t forget that even as late as the Ame Infiltration Arc, when both Naruto and Kakashi are solidly S-Class, Tsunade outright says they\u2019re not strong enough to be Hokage. In a war scenario, the Kage\u2019s role in combat is to take out the other Kages and Jinchuurikis, which Gai wouldn\u2019t be able to do in that space without going 7 or 8 gates, and even then 7 Gates was only enough to beat Kisame because Gai is basically the Anti-Kisame. Any of the big three Kage would\u2019ve beaten 7 Gates Gai. And depending on the timeline of Yagura\u2019s death, he was most likely still Mizukage at the time, meaning 3 of 4 foreign Kage would beat or outlast Gai. Throw in factors like age, experience, intelligence.\n\nFurther, don\u2019t forget the main qualification for 5th Hokage is \u201ccould beat or match Orochimaru\u201d, which Kakashi and Gai definitely couldn\u2019t, Gai would\u2019ve needed 7 gates just to not get his ass whooped, but Orochimaru is a famously slippery fucker who wouldn\u2019t have died in the time Gai had before his body gave out.\n\nHell, Post-Pain Naruto wasn\u2019t even a 6th Hokage candidate, and he would\u2019ve fed both Kakashi and Danzou each other\u2019s spleens in Sage Mode, goes to show how important base level strength is to being Hokage.\n\nYou severely underestimate how much Kakashi and Gai grew in the time gap. Don\u2019t forget, Part 1 Kakashi barely beat Zabuza while rested and with his genin to bail him out. Part 2 Kakashi beat Zabuza and Haku while tired then went on to solo the 7 Swordsman no problem and then keep his Sharingan active for almost 3 consecutive days while spamming ninjutsu that would\u2019ve knocked P1 Kakashi on his ass. And Gai canonically is only stronger than Kakashi in 7th and 8th Gate. You\u2019re looking at their EoS selves, not their barely S-Class on a good day for a minute or so Part 1 selves. And even then Gai only did so well against Kisame because he\u2019s the perfect Anti-Kisame, and he got bailed out repeatedly against a Madara that was dicking around. Gai is the single most overhyped Naruto character, save maybe Minato\n\nFurthermore, S-Class=\\=Kage Level. The Kage Summit Arc makes that insanely clear, when Sasuke, who could\u2019ve handed pretty much any of the Akatsuki reasonably well, promptly gets his shit rocked by each individual Kage and has to be outright bailed out by Zetsu, Obito and Karin.",

Hidan is the perfect mismatch to any I knowledgeable ninja. And like you said Kakashi beat Zabuza, a rouge S-class ninja in part one. That was his classification. I don\u2019t want to be goin back and forth about this. I wholeheartedly disagree with your assessment of the series. The bingo book is a list of S-class ninja which Kakashi was a part of. Zabuza was also a part of that. Kakashi, I agree did grow in that 3 year period, but he didn\u2019t grow from jonin to S-class. He grew from S-class to kage level. \n\u201cFurthermore\u201d no one could take down orochimaru fully due to his curse marks around and split dna lurking in the world like Horcrux from Harry Potter. His base body though could be defeated by Guy. In fact I think if you\u2019re looking at the Hiruzen vs Oro fight which was to the death for the hokage, Guy would have been able to actually take down Orochimaru if it meant he was to sacrifice his own life in the process like Hiruzen did. And Hiruzen only took away Orochimaru\u2019s arms.",

Not A-Rank. \n\nGai and Kakashi are both solid A-Rankers, with spurts as temporary S-Classers when using their buffs. Gai definitely wouldn\u2019t beat Oro\u2019s main body, not with how often he can outright recover from insanely bullshit issues. 1-Tailed Naruto ripped his face off. 4-Tailed Naruto outright ripped him in half and he just put himself back together. Would Gai be stronger than Oro in his higher gates? Absolutely. Would that be enough for him to kill Oro\u2019s body before his own body broke down? Absolutely not.\n\nAnd again, they aren\u2019t looking for someone who would repeat the problem of needing a new Kage in a few weeks.\n\nFurther, Zabuza isn\u2019t S-Class. He\u2019s an A-Ranker. Don\u2019t forget, Sasuke was able to blitz 8 Zabuza water clones, meaning Wave Sasuke was at least 15% of Zabuza\u2019s speed and strength. Sasuke\u2019s good. He\u2019s not that good that he\u2019s 15% of an S-Classer. Zabuza\u2019s whole thing was that he was absolutely deadly with Silent Killing and his surprise attacks but ultimately, when Kakashi got him in a position for a frontal battle, Kakashi bodied him.\n\nThe \u201cBingo Book\u201d is completely undefined. Sai had one of people he killed, so I hope you aren\u2019t trying to tell me that kid Sai was S-Class. It just seems to be a record of info on prominent ninja, so Kakashi Hakate, one of only two known Sharingan users, who was definitely a threat to most people would be in it.\n\nAs for Kage level, Kakashi was definitely coming off worse against a blind, exhausted Sasuke, whereas the Kage each nearly killed him separately while he was rested. Hokage Kakashi is by far the weakest Hokage and the weakest Kage of his generation. Probably one of the weakest Kage period.",

And my point to Guy vs Orochimaru was that given he has to have the same fate as Hiruzen, who died attacking Orochimaru, he would have done better. I wasn\u2019t sayin he\u2019s Kage, but he\u2019s definitely S class. And Kakashi and guy could take on essentially any jonin and many of them in base form. Kakashi alone was famous in every country across the world and was feared by all. He\u2019s S class. Even the Kages across the nations have different power scales so S class doesn\u2019t mean Kage, but to be Kage you definitely need to be an S class. War arc Naruto was hands down S class with all his buffs, but he lacked maturity and leadership to be Kage yet. And as far as Guy in part 2 I didn\u2019t notice a significant boost to his skills from part 1. Even with Kakashi the only bump was his MS. The young kids definitely matured but the adults not as much. You didn\u2019t see the akatsuki members in teasin all that much either. Kage Kakashi would lose to part 1 Kakashi and part 2 Kakashi. I think there\u2019s a lot more S class ninja than what you would consider. Kakashi is a man who if he was a missing-nin and attacked the village it would be a threat the Kage would need to assess. Who do you even consider S class besides the akatsuki and active Kages?",

He\u2019s still barely Kage level.\n\nThe only chance Gai has to take out Orochimaru is to do something to prevent him from just using his absolutely bullshit regen. It would literally be Gai vs Madara again. He can do all the damage he likes, Oro would just regen it. Hiruzen only got a Pyrrhic victory that Oro couldn\u2019t regen via directly attacking his soul.\n\nIf you seriously think the major jump between Kakashi in P1 to P2 was Mangekyo, you definitely need to do a reread. As I said, Kakashi goes from nearly losing to Zabuza while rested, to soloing the 7 Ninja Swordsman while tired and injured, still using a base Sharingan, and then maintaining his Mangekyo for almost 2 whole days against Obito and Madara while spamming high level Ninjutsu and keeping pace with Gai in 6 Gates. \n\nYou can be A-Rank and still feared. Zabuza was. Sasuke was famous even before he was B-Rank. \n\nLike, throw P1 Kakashi against any of the Akatsuki and he\u2019d be crushed. And considering Gai is his equal when not using 7 or 8 in both P1 and P2, it\u2019s the same for him.\n\nThe number of S-Classers outside of Akatsuki or Kages  can be counted on a few hands. Darui, B, Naruto after Kakazu (also Naruto when Shippuden starts, but we\u2019re talking base Naruto here), Sasuke after beating Orochimaru, War Arc Sakura, Kabuto after he starts injecting himself with Oro\u2019s genes. Shippuden Gai and Kakashi. Jiraiya, obviously. I\u2019d probably say that Suigetsu is an S-Classer based on his showings against B and Kisame. Yugito should be, based on our understanding of what it takes to tame a Bijuu, but she got absolutely jobbed by Hidan and Kakazu so I would be hesitant to say she is. Danzou is when using all his buffs, but barely. Iwa has Kurotsuchi in Part 2. You\u2019ll notice they\u2019re all either Kage, future Kage or Kage candidates. It\u2019s honestly something like 1 S-Classer per 15,000 Shinobi or some shit.\n\nKakashi\u2019s good, but Part 1 Kakashi would pretty much just be considered a free Sharingan if he ever went rogue.",

Kakashi didn\u2019t inspire that sort of reaction among the Sound or Sand ninja.\n\nOrochimaru is mildly amused by Kakashi which is impressive, but not enough when you realise the main qualification for 5th Hokage was, \u201cStrong enough that Orochimaru won\u2019t just return to finish the job.\u201d\n\nItachi directly worked with Kakashi according to the Itachi Hiden. It\u2019d be weirder if he didn\u2019t recognise Kakashi.\n\nEven in Part 2, Kakashi doesn\u2019t get the kinds of reactions that Minato did, but that\u2019s mostly because there\u2019s never a fodder ninja around.",

Sakura herself is a Mid-High A-Rank, and we\u2019re explicitly told that the only reason Chiyo wasn\u2019t Kazekage was that she\u2019s so old that it was a genuine possibility that she\u2019d croak at any point. Chiyo in herself pushes the S-Rank boundary, add in Sakura, who via her superior knowledge of poisons and her sheer physical strength who is herself a solid A-Ranker, and they themselves only won because Sasori let them. \n\nAlso, Hidan was kicking Asuma\u2019s ass even without his ritual, literally the only reason Asuma survived for Hidan to pull out the ritual was because Shikamaru bailed him out when Hidan was about to take his head off, and he\u2019s the weakest S-Classer.\n\nAs I said, Gai and Kakashi are temporary S-Classers in Part 1. To give you an idea, in Part 1, Kakashi struggled to follow 5-Gates Lee with his Sharingan, and Kyuubi Naruto is faster than that. And Gai isn\u2019t massively stronger than him. That is how big a gap there is between their part 1 and two versions.",

Don\u2019t forget that even as late as the Ame Infiltration Arc, when both Naruto and Kakashi are solidly S-Class, Tsunade outright says they\u2019re not strong enough to be Hokage. In a war scenario, the Kage\u2019s role in combat is to take out the other Kages and Jinchuurikis, which Gai wouldn\u2019t be able to do in that space without going 7 or 8 gates, and even then 7 Gates was only enough to beat Kisame because Gai is basically the Anti-Kisame. Any of the big three Kage would\u2019ve beaten 7 Gates Gai. And depending on the timeline of Yagura\u2019s death, he was most likely still Mizukage at the time, meaning 3 of 4 foreign Kage would beat or outlast Gai. Throw in factors like age, experience, intelligence.\n\nFurther, don\u2019t forget the main qualification for 5th Hokage is \u201ccould beat or match Orochimaru\u201d, which Kakashi and Gai definitely couldn\u2019t, Gai would\u2019ve needed 7 gates just to not get his ass whooped, but Orochimaru is a famously slippery fucker who wouldn\u2019t have died in the time Gai had before his body gave out.\n\nHell, Post-Pain Naruto wasn\u2019t even a 6th Hokage candidate, and he would\u2019ve fed both Kakashi and Danzou each other\u2019s spleens in Sage Mode, goes to show how important base level strength is to being Hokage.\n\nYou severely underestimate how much Kakashi and Gai grew in the time gap. Don\u2019t forget, Part 1 Kakashi barely beat Zabuza while rested and with his genin to bail him out. Part 2 Kakashi beat Zabuza and Haku while tired then went on to solo the 7 Swordsman no problem and then keep his Sharingan active for almost 3 consecutive days while spamming ninjutsu that would\u2019ve knocked P1 Kakashi on his ass. And Gai canonically is only stronger than Kakashi in 7th and 8th Gate. You\u2019re looking at their EoS selves, not their barely S-Class on a good day for a minute or so Part 1 selves. And even then Gai only did so well against Kisame because he\u2019s the perfect Anti-Kisame, and he got bailed out repeatedly against a Madara that was dicking around. Gai is the single most overhyped Naruto character, save maybe Minato\n\nFurthermore, S-Class=\\=Kage Level. The Kage Summit Arc makes that insanely clear, when Sasuke, who could\u2019ve handed pretty much any of the Akatsuki reasonably well, promptly gets his shit rocked by each individual Kage and has to be outright bailed out by Zetsu, Obito and Karin.",

I don\u2019t want to be goin back and forth about this. I wholeheartedly disagree with your assessment of the series. The bingo book is a list of S-class ninja which Kakashi was a part of. Zabuza was also a part of that. Kakashi, I agree did grow in that 3 year period, but he didn\u2019t grow from jonin to S-class. He grew from S-class to kage level. \n\u201cFurthermore\u201d no one could take down orochimaru fully due to his curse marks around and split dna lurking in the world like Horcrux from Harry Potter. His base body though could be defeated by Guy. In fact I think if you\u2019re looking at the Hiruzen vs Oro fight which was to the death for the hokage, Guy would have been able to actually take down Orochimaru if it meant he was to sacrifice his own life in the process like Hiruzen did.

Gai definitely wouldn\u2019t beat Oro\u2019s main body, not with how often he can outright recover from insanely bullshit issues. 1-Tailed Naruto ripped his face off. 4-Tailed Naruto outright ripped him in half and he just put himself back together. Would Gai be stronger than Oro in his higher gates? Absolutely. Would that be enough for him to kill Oro\u2019s body before his own body broke down? Absolutely not.\n\nAnd again, they aren\u2019t looking for someone who would repeat the problem of needing a new Kage in a few weeks.\n\nFurther, Zabuza isn\u2019t S-Class. He\u2019s an A-Ranker. Don\u2019t forget, Sasuke was able to blitz 8 Zabuza water clones, meaning Wave Sasuke was at least 15% of Zabuza\u2019s speed and strength. Sasuke\u2019s good. He\u2019s not that good that he\u2019s 15% of an S-Classer. Zabuza\u2019s whole thing was that he was absolutely deadly with Silent Killing and his surprise attacks but ultimately, when Kakashi got him in a position for a frontal battle, Kakashi bodied him.\n\nThe \u201cBingo Book\u201d is completely undefined. Sai had one of people he killed, so I hope you aren\u2019t trying to tell me that kid Sai was S-Class. It just seems to be a record of info on prominent ninja, so Kakashi Hakate, one of only two known Sharingan users, who was definitely a threat to most people would be in it.\n\nAs for Kage level, Kakashi was definitely coming off worse against a blind, exhausted Sasuke, whereas the Kage each nearly killed him separately while he was rested. Hokage Kakashi is by far the weakest Hokage and the weakest Kage of his generation. Probably one of the weakest Kage period.",

And my point to Guy vs Orochimaru was that given he has to have the same fate as Hiruzen, who died attacking Orochimaru, he would have done better. I wasn\u2019t sayin he\u2019s Kage, but he\u2019s definitely S class. And Kakashi and guy could take on essentially any jonin and many of them in base form. Kakashi alone was famous in every country across the world and was feared by all. He\u2019s S class. Even the Kages across the nations have different power scales so S class doesn\u2019t mean Kage, but to be Kage you definitely need to be an S class. War arc Naruto was hands down S class with all his buffs, but he lacked maturity and leadership to be Kage yet. And as far as Guy in part 2 I didn\u2019t notice a significant boost to his skills from part 1. Even with Kakashi the only bump was his MS. The young kids definitely matured but the adults not as much. You didn\u2019t see the akatsuki members in teasin all that much either. Kage Kakashi would lose to part 1 Kakashi and part 2 Kakashi. I think there\u2019s a lot more S class ninja than what you would consider. Kakashi is a man who if he was a missing-nin and attacked the village it would be a threat the Kage would need to assess. Who do you even consider S class besides the akatsuki and active Kages?",

He\u2019s still barely Kage level.\n\nThe only chance Gai has to take out Orochimaru is to do something to prevent him from just using his absolutely bullshit regen. It would literally be Gai vs Madara again. He can do all the damage he likes, Oro would just regen it. Hiruzen only got a Pyrrhic victory that Oro couldn\u2019t regen via directly attacking his soul.\n\nIf you seriously think the major jump between Kakashi in P1 to P2 was Mangekyo, you definitely need to do a reread. As I said, Kakashi goes from nearly losing to Zabuza while rested, to soloing the 7 Ninja Swordsman while tired and injured, still using a base Sharingan, and then maintaining his Mangekyo for almost 2 whole days against Obito and Madara while spamming high level Ninjutsu and keeping pace with Gai in 6 Gates. \n\nYou can be A-Rank and still feared. Zabuza was. Sasuke was famous even before he was B-Rank. \n\nLike, throw P1 Kakashi against any of the Akatsuki and he\u2019d be crushed. And considering Gai is his equal when not using 7 or 8 in both P1 and P2, it\u2019s the same for him.\n\nThe number of S-Classers outside of Akatsuki or Kages  can be counted on a few hands. Darui, B, Naruto after Kakazu (also Naruto when Shippuden starts, but we\u2019re talking base Naruto here), Sasuke after beating Orochimaru, War Arc Sakura, Kabuto after he starts injecting himself with Oro\u2019s genes. Shippuden Gai and Kakashi. Jiraiya, obviously. I\u2019d probably say that Suigetsu is an S-Classer based on his showings against B and Kisame. Yugito should be, based on our understanding of what it takes to tame a Bijuu, but she got absolutely jobbed by Hidan and Kakazu so I would be hesitant to say she is. Danzou is when using all his buffs, but barely. Iwa has Kurotsuchi in Part 2. You\u2019ll notice they\u2019re all either Kage, future Kage or Kage candidates. It\u2019s honestly something like 1 S-Classer per 15,000 Shinobi or some shit.\n\nKakashi\u2019s good, but Part 1 Kakashi would pretty much just be considered a free Sharingan if he ever went rogue.",

Don\u2019t forget that even as late as the Ame Infiltration Arc, when both Naruto and Kakashi are solidly S-Class, Tsunade outright says they\u2019re not strong enough to be Hokage. In a war scenario, the Kage\u2019s role in combat is to take out the other Kages and Jinchuurikis, which Gai wouldn\u2019t be able to do in that space without going 7 or 8 gates, and even then 7 Gates was only enough to beat Kisame because Gai is basically the Anti-Kisame. Any of the big three Kage would\u2019ve beaten 7 Gates Gai. And depending on the timeline of Yagura\u2019s death, he was most likely still Mizukage at the time, meaning 3 of 4 foreign Kage would beat or outlast Gai. Throw in factors like age, experience, intelligence.\n\nFurther, don\u2019t forget the main qualification for 5th Hokage is \u201ccould beat or match Orochimaru\u201d, which Kakashi and Gai definitely couldn\u2019t, Gai would\u2019ve needed 7 gates just to not get his ass whooped, but Orochimaru is a famously slippery fucker who wouldn\u2019t have died in the time Gai had before his body gave out.\n\nHell, Post-Pain Naruto wasn\u2019t even a 6th Hokage candidate, and he would\u2019ve fed both Kakashi and Danzou each other\u2019s spleens in Sage Mode, goes to show how important base level strength is to being Hokage.\n\nYou severely underestimate how much Kakashi and Gai grew in the time gap. Don\u2019t forget, Part 1 Kakashi barely beat Zabuza while rested and with his genin to bail him out. Part 2 Kakashi beat Zabuza and Haku while tired then went on to solo the 7 Swordsman no problem and then keep his Sharingan active for almost 3 consecutive days while spamming ninjutsu that would\u2019ve knocked P1 Kakashi on his ass. And Gai canonically is only stronger than Kakashi in 7th and 8th Gate. You\u2019re looking at their EoS selves, not their barely S-Class on a good day for a minute or so Part 1 selves. And even then Gai only did so well against Kisame because he\u2019s the perfect Anti-Kisame, and he got bailed out repeatedly against a Madara that was dicking around. Gai is the single most overhyped Naruto character, save maybe Minato\n\nFurthermore, S-Class=\\=Kage Level. The Kage Summit Arc makes that insanely clear, when Sasuke, who could\u2019ve handed pretty much any of the Akatsuki reasonably well, promptly gets his shit rocked by each individual Kage and has to be outright bailed out by Zetsu, Obito and Karin.",

Hidan is the perfect mismatch to any I knowledgeable ninja. And like you said Kakashi beat Zabuza, a rouge S-class ninja in part one. That was his classification. I don\u2019t want to be goin back and forth about this. I wholeheartedly disagree with your assessment of the series. The bingo book is a list of S-class ninja which Kakashi was a part of. Zabuza was also a part of that. Kakashi, I agree did grow in that 3 year period, but he didn\u2019t grow from jonin to S-class. He grew from S-class to kage level. \n\u201cFurthermore\u201d no one could take down orochimaru fully due to his curse marks around and split dna lurking in the world like Horcrux from Harry Potter. His base body though could be defeated by Guy. In fact I think if you\u2019re looking at the Hiruzen vs Oro fight which was to the death for the hokage, Guy would have been able to actually take down Orochimaru if it meant he was to sacrifice his own life in the process like Hiruzen did.

Not A-Rank. \n\nGai and Kakashi are both solid A-Rankers, with spurts as temporary S-Classers when using their buffs. Gai definitely wouldn\u2019t beat Oro\u2019s main body, not with how often he can outright recover from insanely bullshit issues. 1-Tailed Naruto ripped his face off. 4-Tailed Naruto outright ripped him in half and he just put himself back together. Would Gai be stronger than Oro in his higher gates? Absolutely. Would that be enough for him to kill Oro\u2019s body before his own body broke down? Absolutely not.\n\nAnd again, they aren\u2019t looking for someone who would repeat the problem of needing a new Kage in a few weeks.\n\nFurther, Zabuza isn\u2019t S-Class. He\u2019s an A-Ranker. Don\u2019t forget, Sasuke was able to blitz 8 Zabuza water clones, meaning Wave Sasuke was at least 15% of Zabuza\u2019s speed and strength. Sasuke\u2019s good. He\u2019s not that good that he\u2019s 15% of an S-Classer. Zabuza\u2019s whole thing was that he was absolutely deadly with Silent Killing and his surprise attacks but ultimately, when Kakashi got him in a position for a frontal battle, Kakashi bodied him.\n\nThe \u201cBingo Book\u201d is completely undefined. Sai had one of people he killed, so I hope you aren\u2019t trying to tell me that kid Sai was S-Class. It just seems to be a record of info on prominent ninja, so Kakashi Hakate, one of only two known Sharingan users, who was definitely a threat to most people would be in it.\n\nAs for Kage level, Kakashi was definitely coming off worse against a blind, exhausted Sasuke, whereas the Kage each nearly killed him separately while he was rested. Hokage Kakashi is by far the weakest Hokage and the weakest Kage of his generation. Probably one of the weakest Kage period.",

And my point to Guy vs Orochimaru was that given he has to have the same fate as Hiruzen, who died attacking Orochimaru, he would have done better. I wasn\u2019t sayin he\u2019s Kage, but he\u2019s definitely S class. And Kakashi and guy could take on essentially any jonin and many of them in base form. Kakashi alone was famous in every country across the world and was feared by all. He\u2019s S class. Even the Kages across the nations have different power scales so S class doesn\u2019t mean Kage, but to be Kage you definitely need to be an S class. War arc Naruto was hands down S class with all his buffs, but he lacked maturity and leadership to be Kage yet. And as far as Guy in part 2 I didn\u2019t notice a significant boost to his skills from part 1. Even with Kakashi the only bump was his MS. The young kids definitely matured but the adults not as much. You didn\u2019t see the akatsuki members in teasin all that much either. Kage Kakashi would lose to part 1 Kakashi and part 2 Kakashi. I think there\u2019s a lot more S class ninja than what you would consider. Kakashi is a man who if he was a missing-nin and attacked the village it would be a threat the Kage would need to assess. Who do you even consider S class besides the akatsuki and active Kages?",

He\u2019s still barely Kage level.\n\nThe only chance Gai has to take out Orochimaru is to do something to prevent him from just using his absolutely bullshit regen. It would literally be Gai vs Madara again. He can do all the damage he likes, Oro would just regen it. Hiruzen only got a Pyrrhic victory that Oro couldn\u2019t regen via directly attacking his soul.\n\nIf you seriously think the major jump between Kakashi in P1 to P2 was Mangekyo, you definitely need to do a reread. As I said, Kakashi goes from nearly losing to Zabuza while rested, to soloing the 7 Ninja Swordsman while tired and injured, still using a base Sharingan, and then maintaining his Mangekyo for almost 2 whole days against Obito and Madara while spamming high level Ninjutsu and keeping pace with Gai in 6 Gates. \n\nYou can be A-Rank and still feared. Zabuza was. Sasuke was famous even before he was B-Rank. \n\nLike, throw P1 Kakashi against any of the Akatsuki and he\u2019d be crushed. And considering Gai is his equal when not using 7 or 8 in both P1 and P2, it\u2019s the same for him.\n\nThe number of S-Classers outside of Akatsuki or Kages  can be counted on a few hands. Darui, B, Naruto after Kakazu (also Naruto when Shippuden starts, but we\u2019re talking base Naruto here), Sasuke after beating Orochimaru, War Arc Sakura, Kabuto after he starts injecting himself with Oro\u2019s genes. Shippuden Gai and Kakashi. Jiraiya, obviously. I\u2019d probably say that Suigetsu is an S-Classer based on his showings against B and Kisame. Yugito should be, based on our understanding of what it takes to tame a Bijuu, but she got absolutely jobbed by Hidan and Kakazu so I would be hesitant to say she is. Danzou is when using all his buffs, but barely. Iwa has Kurotsuchi in Part 2. You\u2019ll notice they\u2019re all either Kage, future Kage or Kage candidates. It\u2019s honestly something like 1 S-Classer per 15,000 Shinobi or some shit.\n\nKakashi\u2019s good, but Part 1 Kakashi would pretty much just be considered a free Sharingan if he ever went rogue.",

Don\u2019t forget that even as late as the Ame Infiltration Arc, when both Naruto and Kakashi are solidly S-Class, Tsunade outright says they\u2019re not strong enough to be Hokage. In a war scenario, the Kage\u2019s role in combat is to take out the other Kages and Jinchuurikis, which Gai wouldn\u2019t be able to do in that space without going 7 or 8 gates, and even then 7 Gates was only enough to beat Kisame because Gai is basically the Anti-Kisame. Any of the big three Kage would\u2019ve beaten 7 Gates Gai. And depending on the timeline of Yagura\u2019s death, he was most likely still Mizukage at the time, meaning 3 of 4 foreign Kage would beat or outlast Gai. Throw in factors like age, experience, intelligence.\n\nFurther, don\u2019t forget the main qualification for 5th Hokage is \u201ccould beat or match Orochimaru\u201d, which Kakashi and Gai definitely couldn\u2019t, Gai would\u2019ve needed 7 gates just to not get his ass whooped, but Orochimaru is a famously slippery fucker who wouldn\u2019t have died in the time Gai had before his body gave out.\n\nHell, Post-Pain Naruto wasn\u2019t even a 6th Hokage candidate, and he would\u2019ve fed both Kakashi and Danzou each other\u2019s spleens in Sage Mode, goes to show how important base level strength is to being Hokage.\n\nYou severely underestimate how much Kakashi and Gai grew in the time gap. Don\u2019t forget, Part 1 Kakashi barely beat Zabuza while rested and with his genin to bail him out. Part 2 Kakashi beat Zabuza and Haku while tired then went on to solo the 7 Swordsman no problem and then keep his Sharingan active for almost 3 consecutive days while spamming ninjutsu that would\u2019ve knocked P1 Kakashi on his ass. And Gai canonically is only stronger than Kakashi in 7th and 8th Gate. You\u2019re looking at their EoS selves, not their barely S-Class on a good day for a minute or so Part 1 selves. And even then Gai only did so well against Kisame because he\u2019s the perfect Anti-Kisame, and he got bailed out repeatedly against a Madara that was dicking around. Gai is the single most overhyped Naruto character, save maybe Minato\n\nFurthermore, S-Class=\\=Kage Level. The Kage Summit Arc makes that insanely clear, when Sasuke, who could\u2019ve handed pretty much any of the Akatsuki reasonably well, promptly gets his shit rocked by each individual Kage and has to be outright bailed out by Zetsu, Obito and Karin.",

Hidan is the perfect mismatch to any I knowledgeable ninja. And like you said Kakashi beat Zabuza, a rouge S-class ninja in part one. That was his classification. I don\u2019t want to be goin back and forth about this. I wholeheartedly disagree with your assessment of the series. The bingo book is a list of S-class ninja which Kakashi was a part of. Zabuza was also a part of that. Kakashi, I agree did grow in that 3 year period, but he didn\u2019t grow from jonin to S-class. He grew from S-class to kage level. \n\u201cFurthermore\u201d no one could take down orochimaru fully due to his curse marks around and split dna lurking in the world like Horcrux from Harry Potter. His base body though could be defeated by Guy. In fact I think if you\u2019re looking at the Hiruzen vs Oro fight which was to the death for the hokage, Guy would have been able to actually take down Orochimaru if it meant he was to sacrifice his own life in the process like Hiruzen did.

Would Gai be stronger than Oro in his higher gates? Absolutely. Would that be enough for him to kill Oro\u2019s body before his own body broke down? Absolutely not.\n\nAnd again, they aren\u2019t looking for someone who would repeat the problem of needing a new Kage in a few weeks.\n\nFurther, Zabuza isn\u2019t S-Class. He\u2019s an A-Ranker. Don\u2019t forget, Sasuke was able to blitz 8 Zabuza water clones, meaning Wave Sasuke was at least 15% of Zabuza\u2019s speed and strength. Sasuke\u2019s good. He\u2019s not that good that he\u2019s 15% of an S-Classer. Zabuza\u2019s whole thing was that he was absolutely deadly with Silent Killing and his surprise attacks but ultimately, when Kakashi got him in a position for a frontal battle, Kakashi bodied him.\n\nThe \u201cBingo Book\u201d is completely undefined. Sai had one of people he killed, so I hope you aren\u2019t trying to tell me that kid Sai was S-Class. It just seems to be a record of info on prominent ninja, so Kakashi Hakate, one of only two known Sharingan users, who was definitely a threat to most people would be in it.\n\nAs for Kage level, Kakashi was definitely coming off worse against a blind, exhausted Sasuke, whereas the Kage each nearly killed him separately while he was rested. Hokage Kakashi is by far the weakest Hokage and the weakest Kage of his generation. Probably one of the weakest Kage period.",

I wasn\u2019t sayin he\u2019s Kage, but he\u2019s definitely S class. And Kakashi and guy could take on essentially any jonin and many of them in base form. Kakashi alone was famous in every country across the world and was feared by all. He\u2019s S class. Even the Kages across the nations have different power scales so S class doesn\u2019t mean Kage, but to be Kage you definitely need to be an S class. War arc Naruto was hands down S class with all his buffs, but he lacked maturity and leadership to be Kage yet. And as far as Guy in part 2 I didn\u2019t notice a significant boost to his skills from part 1. Even with Kakashi the only bump was his MS. The young kids definitely matured but the adults not as much. You didn\u2019t see the akatsuki members in teasin all that much either. Kage Kakashi would lose to part 1 Kakashi and part 2 Kakashi. I think there\u2019s a lot more S class ninja than what you would consider. Kakashi is a man who if he was a missing-nin and attacked the village it would be a threat the Kage would need to assess. Who do you even consider S class besides the akatsuki and active Kages?",

He\u2019s still barely Kage level.\n\nThe only chance Gai has to take out Orochimaru is to do something to prevent him from just using his absolutely bullshit regen. It would literally be Gai vs Madara again. He can do all the damage he likes, Oro would just regen it. Hiruzen only got a Pyrrhic victory that Oro couldn\u2019t regen via directly attacking his soul.\n\nIf you seriously think the major jump between Kakashi in P1 to P2 was Mangekyo, you definitely need to do a reread. As I said, Kakashi goes from nearly losing to Zabuza while rested, to soloing the 7 Ninja Swordsman while tired and injured, still using a base Sharingan, and then maintaining his Mangekyo for almost 2 whole days against Obito and Madara while spamming high level Ninjutsu and keeping pace with Gai in 6 Gates. \n\nYou can be A-Rank and still feared. Zabuza was. Sasuke was famous even before he was B-Rank. \n\nLike, throw P1 Kakashi against any of the Akatsuki and he\u2019d be crushed. And considering Gai is his equal when not using 7 or 8 in both P1 and P2, it\u2019s the same for him.\n\nThe number of S-Classers outside of Akatsuki or Kages  can be counted on a few hands. Darui, B, Naruto after Kakazu (also Naruto when Shippuden starts, but we\u2019re talking base Naruto here), Sasuke after beating Orochimaru, War Arc Sakura, Kabuto after he starts injecting himself with Oro\u2019s genes. Shippuden Gai and Kakashi. Jiraiya, obviously. I\u2019d probably say that Suigetsu is an S-Classer based on his showings against B and Kisame. Yugito should be, based on our understanding of what it takes to tame a Bijuu, but she got absolutely jobbed by Hidan and Kakazu so I would be hesitant to say she is. Danzou is when using all his buffs, but barely. Iwa has Kurotsuchi in Part 2. You\u2019ll notice they\u2019re all either Kage, future Kage or Kage candidates. It\u2019s honestly something like 1 S-Classer per 15,000 Shinobi or some shit.\n\nKakashi\u2019s good, but Part 1 Kakashi would pretty much just be considered a free Sharingan if he ever went rogue.",

It\u2019d be weirder if he didn\u2019t recognise Kakashi.\n\nEven in Part 2, Kakashi doesn\u2019t get the kinds of reactions that Minato did, but that\u2019s mostly because there\u2019s never a fodder ninja around.",

I don\u2019t want to be goin back and forth about this. I wholeheartedly disagree with your assessment of the series. The bingo book is a list of S-class ninja which Kakashi was a part of. Zabuza was also a part of that. Kakashi, I agree did grow in that 3 year period, but he didn\u2019t grow from jonin to S-class. He grew from S-class to kage level. \n\u201cFurthermore\u201d no one could take down orochimaru fully due to his curse marks around and split dna lurking in the world like Horcrux from Harry Potter. His base body though could be defeated by Guy. In fact I think if you\u2019re looking at the Hiruzen vs Oro fight which was to the death for the hokage, Guy would have been able to actually take down Orochimaru if it meant he was to sacrifice his own life in the process like Hiruzen did. And Hiruzen only took away Orochimaru\u2019s arms.",

Not A-Rank. \n\nGai and Kakashi are both solid A-Rankers, with spurts as temporary S-Classers when using their buffs. Gai definitely wouldn\u2019t beat Oro\u2019s main body, not with how often he can outright recover from insanely bullshit issues. 1-Tailed Naruto ripped his face off. 4-Tailed Naruto outright ripped him in half and he just put himself back together. Would Gai be stronger than Oro in his higher gates? Absolutely. Would that be enough for him to kill Oro\u2019s body before his own body broke down? Absolutely not.\n\nAnd again, they aren\u2019t looking for someone who would repeat the problem of needing a new Kage in a few weeks.\n\nFurther, Zabuza isn\u2019t S-Class. He\u2019s an A-Ranker. Don\u2019t forget, Sasuke was able to blitz 8 Zabuza water clones, meaning Wave Sasuke was at least 15% of Zabuza\u2019s speed and strength. Sasuke\u2019s good. He\u2019s not that good that he\u2019s 15% of an S-Classer. Zabuza\u2019s whole thing was that he was absolutely deadly with Silent Killing and his surprise attacks but ultimately, when Kakashi got him in a position for a frontal battle, Kakashi bodied him.\n\nThe \u201cBingo Book\u201d is completely undefined. Sai had one of people he killed, so I hope you aren\u2019t trying to tell me that kid Sai was S-Class. It just seems to be a record of info on prominent ninja, so Kakashi Hakate, one of only two known Sharingan users, who was definitely a threat to most people would be in it.\n\nAs for Kage level, Kakashi was definitely coming off worse against a blind, exhausted Sasuke, whereas the Kage each nearly killed him separately while he was rested. Hokage Kakashi is by far the weakest Hokage and the weakest Kage of his generation. Probably one of the weakest Kage period.",

And my point to Guy vs Orochimaru was that given he has to have the same fate as Hiruzen, who died attacking Orochimaru, he would have done better. I wasn\u2019t sayin he\u2019s Kage, but he\u2019s definitely S class. And Kakashi and guy could take on essentially any jonin and many of them in base form. Kakashi alone was famous in every country across the world and was feared by all. He\u2019s S class. Even the Kages across the nations have different power scales so S class doesn\u2019t mean Kage, but to be Kage you definitely need to be an S class. War arc Naruto was hands down S class with all his buffs, but he lacked maturity and leadership to be Kage yet. And as far as Guy in part 2 I didn\u2019t notice a significant boost to his skills from part 1. Even with Kakashi the only bump was his MS. The young kids definitely matured but the adults not as much. You didn\u2019t see the akatsuki members in teasin all that much either. Kage Kakashi would lose to part 1 Kakashi and part 2 Kakashi. I think there\u2019s a lot more S class ninja than what you would consider. Kakashi is a man who if he was a missing-nin and attacked the village it would be a threat the Kage would need to assess. Who do you even consider S class besides the akatsuki and active Kages?",

He\u2019s still barely Kage level.\n\nThe only chance Gai has to take out Orochimaru is to do something to prevent him from just using his absolutely bullshit regen. It would literally be Gai vs Madara again. He can do all the damage he likes, Oro would just regen it. Hiruzen only got a Pyrrhic victory that Oro couldn\u2019t regen via directly attacking his soul.\n\nIf you seriously think the major jump between Kakashi in P1 to P2 was Mangekyo, you definitely need to do a reread. As I said, Kakashi goes from nearly losing to Zabuza while rested, to soloing the 7 Ninja Swordsman while tired and injured, still using a base Sharingan, and then maintaining his Mangekyo for almost 2 whole days against Obito and Madara while spamming high level Ninjutsu and keeping pace with Gai in 6 Gates. \n\nYou can be A-Rank and still feared. Zabuza was. Sasuke was famous even before he was B-Rank. \n\nLike, throw P1 Kakashi against any of the Akatsuki and he\u2019d be crushed. And considering Gai is his equal when not using 7 or 8 in both P1 and P2, it\u2019s the same for him.\n\nThe number of S-Classers outside of Akatsuki or Kages  can be counted on a few hands. Darui, B, Naruto after Kakazu (also Naruto when Shippuden starts, but we\u2019re talking base Naruto here), Sasuke after beating Orochimaru, War Arc Sakura, Kabuto after he starts injecting himself with Oro\u2019s genes. Shippuden Gai and Kakashi. Jiraiya, obviously. I\u2019d probably say that Suigetsu is an S-Classer based on his showings against B and Kisame. Yugito should be, based on our understanding of what it takes to tame a Bijuu, but she got absolutely jobbed by Hidan and Kakazu so I would be hesitant to say she is. Danzou is when using all his buffs, but barely. Iwa has Kurotsuchi in Part 2. You\u2019ll notice they\u2019re all either Kage, future Kage or Kage candidates. It\u2019s honestly something like 1 S-Classer per 15,000 Shinobi or some shit.\n\nKakashi\u2019s good, but Part 1 Kakashi would pretty much just be considered a free Sharingan if he ever went rogue.",

            "body": "You\u2019ve missed something important. Jounin=B Rank. Not A-Rank. \n\nGai and Kakashi are both solid A-Rankers, with spurts as temporary S-Classers when using their buffs. Gai definitely wouldn\u2019t beat Oro\u2019s main body, not with how often he can outright recover from insanely bullshit issues. 1-Tailed Naruto ripped his face off. 4-Tailed Naruto outright ripped him in half and he just put himself back together. Would Gai be stronger than Oro in his higher gates? Absolutely. Would that be enough for him to kill Oro\u2019s body before his own body broke down? Absolutely not.\n\nAnd again, they aren\u2019t looking for someone who would repeat the problem of needing a new Kage in a few weeks.\n\nFurther, Zabuza isn\u2019t S-Class. He\u2019s an A-Ranker. Don\u2019t forget, Sasuke was able to blitz 8 Zabuza water clones, meaning Wave Sasuke was at least 15% of Zabuza\u2019s speed and strength. Sasuke\u2019s good. He\u2019s not that good that he\u2019s 15% of an S-Classer. Zabuza\u2019s whole thing was that he was absolutely deadly with Silent Killing and his surprise attacks but ultimately, when Kakashi got him in a position for a frontal battle, Kakashi bodied him.\n\nThe \u201cBingo Book\u201d is completely undefined. Sai had one of people he killed, so I hope you aren\u2019t trying to tell me that kid Sai was S-Class. It just seems to be a record of info on prominent ninja, so Kakashi Hakate, one of only two known Sharingan users, who was definitely a threat to most people would be in it.\n\nAs for Kage level, Kakashi was definitely coming off worse against a blind, exhausted Sasuke, whereas the Kage each nearly killed him separately while he was rested. Hokage Kakashi is by far the weakest Hokage and the weakest Kage of his generation. Probably one of the weakest Kage period.",

It\u2019s a one and done boost.\n\nYou said Kakashi was jounin when I named him A-Rank. He\u2019s higher than Jounin, significantly lower than Kage.\n\nJust a reminder, the gap between Jounin and Kage is enough that 10,000 Jounin only beat a Kage through sheer attrition.",

I wasn\u2019t sayin he\u2019s Kage, but he\u2019s definitely S class. And Kakashi and guy could take on essentially any jonin and many of them in base form. Kakashi alone was famous in every country across the world and was feared by all. He\u2019s S class. Even the Kages across the nations have different power scales so S class doesn\u2019t mean Kage, but to be Kage you definitely need to be an S class. War arc Naruto was hands down S class with all his buffs, but he lacked maturity and leadership to be Kage yet. And as far as Guy in part 2 I didn\u2019t notice a significant boost to his skills from part 1. Even with Kakashi the only bump was his MS. The young kids definitely matured but the adults not as much. You didn\u2019t see the akatsuki members in teasin all that much either. Kage Kakashi would lose to part 1 Kakashi and part 2 Kakashi. I think there\u2019s a lot more S class ninja than what you would consider. Kakashi is a man who if he was a missing-nin and attacked the village it would be a threat the Kage would need to assess. Who do you even consider S class besides the akatsuki and active Kages?",
