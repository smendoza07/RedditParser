You can instead let the sides taper softly into the top, as in on a classic tapered cut sometimes known as a regular haircut. You can have it taper high or low, sometimes with a fade, really short to up to about an inch on the sides, the important part is the taper itself. It's still short-on-sides-long-on-top, but as the sides grow out, it doesn't look bad because it's blended well with the top.\n\nI let mine go around six weeks before it looks bad, but I could probably go longer if I got my ears, sideburns, and neckline cleaned sometime in the middle. \n\nThis haircut was actually the most common at the turn of the 20th century, but it required a more skilled barber with the equipment they had at the time so the working classes/military were the ones getting undercuts.\n\nEdit: loooots of spelling errors",

You can instead let the sides taper softly into the top, as in on a classic tapered cut sometimes known as a regular haircut. You can have it taper high or low, sometimes with a fade, really short to up to about an inch on the sides, the important part is the taper itself. It's still short-on-sides-long-on-top, but as the sides grow out, it doesn't look bad because it's blended well with the top.\n\nI let mine go around six weeks before it looks bad, but I could probably go longer if I got my ears, sideburns, and neckline cleaned sometime in the middle. \n\nThis haircut was actually the most common at the turn of the 20th century, but it required a more skilled barber with the equipment they had at the time so the working classes/military were the ones getting undercuts.\n\nEdit: loooots of spelling errors",
