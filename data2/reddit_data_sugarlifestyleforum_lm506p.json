I know there are men on seeking specifically look for certain ethnic groups, but still remain incredibly respectful. I\u2019d be lying if I haven\u2019t used some of the features that I was blessed with by being born Asian to my advantage. I\u2019m not shading on those who exclusively look for certain ethnicities either, as long as they\u2019re being RESPECTFUL.\n\nBut if the only reason why someone choose me as their partner was based on the color of my skin and the socially-constructed stereotypes that comes with it, that\u2019s offensive. That means I\u2019m not being viewed as a person at all, but rather a submissive schoolgirl/Chinese porcelain doll/geisha/short, petite, tight pussy. The moment I deviate from that fantasy and stereotype, it\u2019s over.

Hell, online dating is not racially fair. But trying to downplay fetishization and racism as \u201chaving a preference\u201d, that\u2019s another story.",

I\u2019ve met men who look specifically for Asian women and are way more respectful than men who have All Ethnicity tag. Heck, I don\u2019t even consider being asked \u201cWhat kind of Asian are you\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re so exotic where are you really from?\u201d offensive because they may be genuinely curious and older men tend to associate exotic as being a complement. I\u2019m simply pointing out that when men go for certain race groups just because of some sexual stereotypes as stated above (for example: submissive, tighter, smaller for Asian women), without even caring about all the different indigenous groups of people in Asia, and such objectification is unwanted from the woman of said race group, it is considered offensive. If the woman also consent and welcome such advances and okay being treated like that, then it\u2019s not my business. Just because a man is paying doesn\u2019t mean I have to become his sex toy, and just because it\u2019s \u201crealistic\u201d, doesn\u2019t mean I have to be okay with it. If SDs don\u2019t like to be treated like an ATM, SBs don\u2019t like to be treated like objects. Simple as that. If you wish to think the bowl is like a buffet where SDs get to sample out different flavors of the week, have his fun and move on to the next hottie, then of course it is well within your right.

Having a kink were you like being treated in a certain way like an object or a sex toy is completely different than someone casually objectifying you without your consent. If you do like getting objectified it would be a form of a BDSM kink and you\u2019d give consent to being treated like that, which would proof that in fact you are not an object. You are a consenting human who can revoke their consent at any time. Consent is the key word here in case someone missed that. \n\nI do agree that objectification of SBs is a large part of the bowl but I believe it to be one of the toxic trades. It is even more alarming if SDs think that all SBs have the same very specific kink of liking being objectified?\nLets just step back and think about it for a moment and ask the SDs if their kink is to objectify women? I seriously doubt it is. Does objectifying their SBs make them horny? Is that really what turns them on? If it does than great you found your kink and there will be an SB out there with the same kink for you, but if it doesn\u2019t turn you on then why do you do it? It seems like a totally unnecessary thing that can be avoided by both parties by just showing a bit of empathy and communicating sufficiently. \n\nI wish you all happy dating and consensual play without upsetting one another.

Don't these attitudes toward people of color help to eliminate racism rather than perpetuate it?  \n>  \n>Wrong.  \n>  \n>When you reduce human beings to characteristics, often stereotypical of their race, ethnicity, or culture, you're objectifying them to fulfill your own personal wishes and expectations for how they should look and/or behave.

Attraction is being drawn to someone because of some of their features, their interests or their personality. Fetishization, specifically in regards to race, is being attracted to a person solely because of one thing: their skin color.  \n>  \n>By fixating on someone\u2019s skin color, they\u2019re being othered in a sexual way.

I\u2019ve met men who look specifically for Asian women and are way more respectful than men who have All Ethnicity tag. Heck, I don\u2019t even consider being asked \u201cWhat kind of Asian are you\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re so exotic where are you really from?\u201d offensive because they may be genuinely curious and older men tend to associate exotic as being a complement. I\u2019m simply pointing out that when men go for certain race groups just because of some sexual stereotypes as stated above (for example: submissive, tighter, smaller for Asian women), without even caring about all the different indigenous groups of people in Asia, and such objectification is unwanted from the woman of said race group, it is considered offensive. If the woman also consent and welcome such advances and okay being treated like that, then it\u2019s not my business. Just because a man is paying doesn\u2019t mean I have to become his sex toy, and just because it\u2019s \u201crealistic\u201d, doesn\u2019t mean I have to be okay with it. If SDs don\u2019t like to be treated like an ATM, SBs don\u2019t like to be treated like objects. Simple as that. If you wish to think the bowl is like a buffet where SDs get to sample out different flavors of the week, have his fun and move on to the next hottie, then of course it is well within your right. I however choose to not entertain that idea.",

Having a kink were you like being treated in a certain way like an object or a sex toy is completely different than someone casually objectifying you without your consent. If you do like getting objectified it would be a form of a BDSM kink and you\u2019d give consent to being treated like that, which would proof that in fact you are not an object. You are a consenting human who can revoke their consent at any time. Consent is the key word here in case someone missed that. \n\nI do agree that objectification of SBs is a large part of the bowl but I believe it to be one of the toxic trades. It is even more alarming if SDs think that all SBs have the same very specific kink of liking being objectified?\nLets just step back and think about it for a moment and ask the SDs if their kink is to objectify women? I seriously doubt it is. Does objectifying their SBs make them horny? Is that really what turns them on? If it does than great you found your kink and there will be an SB out there with the same kink for you, but if it doesn\u2019t turn you on then why do you do it? It seems like a totally unnecessary thing that can be avoided by both parties by just showing a bit of empathy and communicating sufficiently. \n\nI wish you all happy dating and consensual play without upsetting one another. May Great Communication bless you with their presence.",

So no, features don\u2019t have to be inherently racist, although even just playing the probability game with certain tags and filters can have questionable motivation. Certainly skin color is more dicey. Sure you can *say* you just prefer the look, but really? You\u2019re really going to tell me that you can only find someone attractive if they have a certain color of skin, and that you\u2019d *really* be open to someone with different ethnic features if they managed to achieve that perfect level of melanin? \n\nThe level of rigidity matters too. It\u2019s realistic to say that most everyone has an ideal type, but if you\u2019re going to tell me that you\u2019ve only ever seen X women as potential partners... really? Are you really sure about that? Some people will always be able to justify themselves beyond any questioning, but sometimes you\u2019ll be forced to stop and think like \u201cis that really what I mean?\u201d And the answer might be an uncomfortable truth.",

I really don\u2019t think they were fetishizing my accent, nor do they have a preference for men with accents.

I\u2019ve met men who look specifically for Asian women and are way more respectful than men who have All Ethnicity tag. Heck, I don\u2019t even consider being asked \u201cWhat kind of Asian are you\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re so exotic where are you really from?\u201d offensive because they may be genuinely curious and older men tend to associate exotic as being a complement. I\u2019m simply pointing out that when men go for certain race groups just because of some sexual stereotypes as stated above (for example: submissive, tighter, smaller for Asian women), without even caring about all the different indigenous groups of people in Asia, and such objectification is unwanted from the woman of said race group, it is considered offensive. If the woman also consent and welcome such advances and okay being treated like that, then it\u2019s not my business. Just because a man is paying doesn\u2019t mean I have to become his sex toy, and just because it\u2019s \u201crealistic\u201d, doesn\u2019t mean I have to be okay with it.

Having a kink were you like being treated in a certain way like an object or a sex toy is completely different than someone casually objectifying you without your consent. If you do like getting objectified it would be a form of a BDSM kink and you\u2019d give consent to being treated like that, which would proof that in fact you are not an object. You are a consenting human who can revoke their consent at any time. Consent is the key word here in case someone missed that. \n\nI do agree that objectification of SBs is a large part of the bowl but I believe it to be one of the toxic trades. It is even more alarming if SDs think that all SBs have the same very specific kink of liking being objectified?\nLets just step back and think about it for a moment and ask the SDs if their kink is to objectify women? I seriously doubt it is. Does objectifying their SBs make them horny? Is that really what turns them on? If it does than great you found your kink and there will be an SB out there with the same kink for you, but if it doesn\u2019t turn you on then why do you do it? It seems like a totally unnecessary thing that can be avoided by both parties by just showing a bit of empathy and communicating sufficiently. \n\nI wish you all happy dating and consensual play without upsetting one another.

A submissive is literally any person who identifies as submissive in their kink dynamic...any person with actual Dom experience who isn't trying to prey on someone and create unhealthy power dynamics isn't gonna filter out their subs by size lol  \nETA: Aggression and disrespect aren't a kink, are you kidding me? An \\*actual\\* dominant individual isn't gonna disrespect a potential submissive until the terms of their engagement/kink have been established and that was given a green light.",

Certainly skin color is more dicey. Sure you can *say* you just prefer the look, but really?

Having a kink were you like being treated in a certain way like an object or a sex toy is completely different than someone casually objectifying you without your consent. If you do like getting objectified it would be a form of a BDSM kink and you\u2019d give consent to being treated like that, which would proof that in fact you are not an object. You are a consenting human who can revoke their consent at any time. Consent is the key word here in case someone missed that. \n\nI do agree that objectification of SBs is a large part of the bowl but I believe it to be one of the toxic trades. It is even more alarming if SDs think that all SBs have the same very specific kink of liking being objectified?\nLets just step back and think about it for a moment and ask the SDs if their kink is to objectify women? I seriously doubt it is. Does objectifying their SBs make them horny? Is that really what turns them on? If it does than great you found your kink and there will be an SB out there with the same kink for you, but if it doesn\u2019t turn you on then why do you do it? It seems like a totally unnecessary thing that can be avoided by both parties by just showing a bit of empathy and communicating sufficiently. \n\nI wish you all happy dating and consensual play without upsetting one another. May Great Communication bless you with their presence.",

Just because a woman doesn\u2019t have all of the features I \u2018prefer\u2019, doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t find her attractive, doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t see her as a potential partner. \n\nThe original post as well as some of the comments just made me think. It happens from time to time \ud83d\ude09 \n\nI don\u2019t think what the man in OP\u2019s post said was appropriate. I had women tell me at M&G\u2019s they liked my accent (I am not born in the US). I really don\u2019t think they were fetishizing my accent, nor do they have a preference for men with accents. I also don\u2019t think they were being racist - all they did was flirtatious small talk. The post and the comments did make me think about were the line is between having a preference and being inappropriate.",

Having a kink were you like being treated in a certain way like an object or a sex toy is completely different than someone casually objectifying you without your consent. If you do like getting objectified it would be a form of a BDSM kink and you\u2019d give consent to being treated like that, which would proof that in fact you are not an object. You are a consenting human who can revoke their consent at any time. Consent is the key word here in case someone missed that. \n\nI do agree that objectification of SBs is a large part of the bowl but I believe it to be one of the toxic trades. It is even more alarming if SDs think that all SBs have the same very specific kink of liking being objectified?\nLets just step back and think about it for a moment and ask the SDs if their kink is to objectify women? I seriously doubt it is. Does objectifying their SBs make them horny? Is that really what turns them on? If it does than great you found your kink and there will be an SB out there with the same kink for you, but if it doesn\u2019t turn you on then why do you do it? It seems like a totally unnecessary thing that can be avoided by both parties by just showing a bit of empathy and communicating sufficiently. \n\nI wish you all happy dating and consensual play without upsetting one another. May Great Communication bless you with their presence.",

Having a kink were you like being treated in a certain way like an object or a sex toy is completely different than someone casually objectifying you without your consent. If you do like getting objectified it would be a form of a BDSM kink and you\u2019d give consent to being treated like that, which would proof that in fact you are not an object. You are a consenting human who can revoke their consent at any time. Consent is the key word here in case someone missed that. \n\nI do agree that objectification of SBs is a large part of the bowl but I believe it to be one of the toxic trades. It is even more alarming if SDs think that all SBs have the same very specific kink of liking being objectified?\nLets just step back and think about it for a moment and ask the SDs if their kink is to objectify women? I seriously doubt it is. Does objectifying their SBs make them horny? Is that really what turns them on? If it does than great you found your kink and there will be an SB out there with the same kink for you, but if it doesn\u2019t turn you on then why do you do it? It seems like a totally unnecessary thing that can be avoided by both parties by just showing a bit of empathy and communicating sufficiently. \n\nI wish you all happy dating and consensual play without upsetting one another. May Great Communication bless you with their presence.",

Having a kink were you like being treated in a certain way like an object or a sex toy is completely different than someone casually objectifying you without your consent. If you do like getting objectified it would be a form of a BDSM kink and you\u2019d give consent to being treated like that, which would proof that in fact you are not an object. You are a consenting human who can revoke their consent at any time. Consent is the key word here in case someone missed that. \n\nI do agree that objectification of SBs is a large part of the bowl but I believe it to be one of the toxic trades. It is even more alarming if SDs think that all SBs have the same very specific kink of liking being objectified?\nLets just step back and think about it for a moment and ask the SDs if their kink is to objectify women? I seriously doubt it is. Does objectifying their SBs make them horny? Is that really what turns them on? If it does than great you found your kink and there will be an SB out there with the same kink for you, but if it doesn\u2019t turn you on then why do you do it? It seems like a totally unnecessary thing that can be avoided by both parties by just showing a bit of empathy and communicating sufficiently. \n\nI wish you all happy dating and consensual play without upsetting one another.
