    "body": "New SB here.\n\nI understand that SD's don't want to get rinsed and that's why the money starts after intimacy starts. You don't want to feel like an ATM, I get it. You don't want it to feel transactional or like you're paying for sex. \n\nWhat I don't understand is how to not feel like a low cost escort if I don't get any cash or gifts until after intimacy. I understand that buying me dinner costs you money and sure, the leftovers the next day are great, but I can get a free dinner from any guy, on any regular dating site.\n\nSB's, how do you balance this? If I'm not worth any money until I give it up, it does feel transactional, and it doesn't feel good to me.",

            "body": "Yeah, this is a real concern, and an unfortunate consequence of both SBs and SDs having to protect themselves against bad actors. You can read the stories on this sub.\n\nAs some have said, I think most folks just push past it for the first few dates in a new SR until it feels more natural.\n\nA small tweak that works for me: Here in Europe, \"PPM\" seems to be a dirty word. The real SBs looking for longer term SRs hate it. So I've switched to \"weekly allowance,\" with an explicit path to monthly allowance after a few weeks\n\nSo there's a bit of risk to me, but it's capped. And it feels more like a relationship and less like a money-on-the-dresser situation. Obviously I adjust the amount a bit if we're expecting more or less than one date per week.\n\nMight be something to try if \"PPM on the first intimate date\" makes you feel icky? Good luck!",

So  much of life is how you present everything from yourself, your intentions, your wine and your sugar. \n\nReferring to it as a weekly allowance is wrapping the $$$ in a nice verbal wrapping (and of course the amount is crisp new bills in an envelope perhaps with a note of thanks) \n\nAmerican Airlines has a net worth of $13 bil and I have been a customer since the earth cooled ......  but I am still expected (required) to have made financial arrangements for my flight before I am issued a boarding pass.

Meaning my POT sb is very attentive, polite, looking amazing, and over all sexy and interesting. That way she has something, a taste if you will. Now thats all she gets until our first intimate date. I let her know that there's no rush and we can have as many platonic dates as she needs, its usually an issue with making sure there's a connection or enough attraction to proceed. I also like to discuss usually before the m&g and try to make it clear that if by date 3 or 4 if there's still not enough attraction or connection to proceed to intimacy then more dates will likely not matter and its time to look for another partner. If that happens depending again on how well she was towards me I will usually give another half to full ppm as a parting gift. Now I don't let any of them know this up front, otherwise I think I would be run through the ringer",

I\u2019ve told her no pressure, when she\u2019s ready \u2026 which I expect to be this Saturday, she\u2019s indicated she\u2019d like to spend the night.  In the meantime, we\u2019ve gotten to know each other and deepening the relationship.  I am in the bowl because I find it easier to be authentic and myself than I do in vanilla dating.  I\u2019m looking for a strong emotional connection and a SGF for the long term.  I believe that moving to allowance prior to full intimacy, plus my words of support and encouragement for some of the drama she\u2019s going thru in rl are helping us move towards the relationship I\u2019m seeking.  I\u2019ve been in the bowl a little less than a year and she\u2019s my 3rd SB.  If I stuck to PPM until full intimacy, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019d be where we are today.

I personally think many women came round to treating it like escorting when men started approaching them online asking for PPM w intimacy. The thing is.....escorts I know that are not survival workers ARE screening first and they DO take safety precautions. They also treat it likes a business and don't get too chummy or comfortable with men bc if you do, you get taken advantage of and boundaries tested and pushed. Sex work (in any realm) can be very draining. They call that aspect \"emotional labor\" (and this isn't just inherent to SW of course).\n\nThe men want it both ways...if you want it to be less transactional then pay an allowance and don't treat her like she's disposable or like you're just paying for intimacy.",

An SD can afford to lose the gift/PPM/allowance (he will not be thrilled, but if he cannot afford it he should not be an SD)\n2. The risk of intimacy with a P&D for the SB is greater impact than the SD getting rinsed\n\nI intentionally make sure a POT SB has her gift before getting alone for intimacy, and that I give her a gracious way to end the date with that in hand. Yes, it will be the first date where I expect intimacy, and yes, I take the risk. I have yet to have an SB accept her gift and fail to move forward as agreed. It takes vetting, and time, and yes, that day when I eventually get 'rinsed' I'll be pissed.

But, unfortunately that's not the reality, so all you can do is try to navigate the reality of things the best way you can. He doesn't want to risk being scammed and she doesn't want to risk being sexually used. So, I think the compromise is that both people have to go without the sex and the money to show that, that's not what's the actual focus of the relationship. That, that's not what's holding the relationship together and that the relationship really is genuine and real because both are willing to go without sugar to show it. Also, this way if a genuine relationship can't be built the only thing lost if it doesn't work out is time for both people. Time is something scammers and men looking for cheap escorts will never invest in.",

SDs often complain about how they don't feel like anything but an ATM and how they get no honey if no money so I suppose it's opposite sides of the same coin.\n\nThe questions you might need to answer is this: \n\n* How many platonic dates until intimacy happen for you? \n* If you want these to be paid how much are you asking for? \n* If you're asking for them to be paid what are you bringing to these men that they are unable to get somewhere else? (some SDs already have someone at home talking to them about their day, taking their money and not providing intimacy).\n* Do you ask for your Tinder dates to pay you a ppm too? If no, why not the same logic applies? And if that doesn't make sense why does an SD need to pay you for a platonic date? Is it because you wouldn't date him otherwise? If so, than maybe you're the one making it feel transactional and making yourself feel like a cheap escort. Try only sugaring people you're attracted to.\n* For guys who are wanting intimacy as part of the arrangement do you give the ppm back if after 2-5 dates you decide intimacy will not ever happen?\n* If you're ok with intimacy with a SD is it ok to have intimate dates for the month and then get paid at the end of the month?",

They are for your safety as well as the SD safety.\n\nThe PPM option is to protect you from getting cheated by a fake SD pretending to pay you at the end of the month or a rinser from grabbing the whole month worth of allowance. It allows you to break up without anything attached and allow both parties to process what happened.\n\nFor example, you got the a whole month of allowance and you didn't like the SD in bed. You could tough it out for the whole month, give back the money or become a rinser and flee with it. Or maybe the SD didn't like the intimacy and he has to chalk up the lost or just try to push his boundaries to get back some of the cost.\n\nAfter a couple of PPM, you guys have to move on to allowance. It will make the relationship more real.",

The norm these days - and even after it seemed there was some trust established.  I still believe SR boil down to 2 people wanting to spend time together.  And sometimes that mutual feeling is never there; and sometimes it is there one day and not the next.  For my best SBs, there was never a question in my mind they wanted to spend time with me and I with them. In this case, she either got greedy, found a better deal elsewhere, or just lost interest.  It happens.\n\nSB: Hey daddy, you forgot my allowance.\n\nME : Nope - surprise, surprise.  Check your pursue.\n\nSB: There's nothing in there\n\nME: I absolutely put money in your purse. Side pocket. I also saw a pen, a small notepad, and a hair tie.  So look in that pocket.\n\nSB: It's not there. It must have fallen out.\n\nME: The pocket is zipped.\n\nSB: It opens by itself all the time.\n\nME: I see. I promise, it is in there.\n\nSB: It's not. You owe me.\n\nME: Hey, I will send you the amount via PayPal just so there are no questions.  In the past, it never was an issue putting it in your purse this way for you, so I'll bite the bullet on this one.\n\nSB: Ok, thank you so much.\n\n(next meeting)\n\nME: Here you go.  $X as promised in your hand.  We don't have to worry about any purse failure situations.\n\nSB: Last time you gave me $2X\n\nME: No, last time I gave you $X which you said you never got and I was generous and understanding and sent you another $X just to be safe.\n\nSB: So you can afford $2X?\n\nME: That's not the point. Plus, you told me you couldn't find the money and that it was lost.\n\nSB: I just wasn't sure where it was from.\n\nME: So, a few days later, you found $X in your purse where I told you I put it and the magic money fairy put it there? You didn't think it was maybe from me?\n\nSB: Well, idk.\n\nME: Well, I am a little confused here.  You weren't forthcoming. And now I am not sure if you were forgetful, intentionally scamming me, or just being greedy.  We had a deal and you said it was good for you and it was good for me.  I am not trying to be cheap; I just want things to be sustainable and allow room to do a little extra from time to time.\n\nSB: Well, so you can afford $2X\n\nME: No.\n\nSB: You just want a prostitue.\n\nME: Yep, I guess so.",

I personally don\u2019t care if I\u2019m seen with a younger attractive woman. I\u2019m looking for someone that\u2019s enjoying being with me, and gets a financial benefit as well. If you don\u2019t want to be on the date, then I\u2019m not interested. Unfortunately, it can feel transactional at first, but you need to understand the reasoning why and not think anything negative about it, or yourself.",

I will behave more like an escort is what Im saying. You get what you put in and Im trying to make the relationship work, but it takes the other person too!\n\nI believe a great arrangement is actually confirmed when its date night but you decided not to have sex for whatever reason (ate too much, argument, tired, period, erectile dysfunction, etc) and you STILL GET YOUR PPM. That right there shows me that you actually see me as more than a sex object. Im human. Sometimes I dont want to have sex and some men want their SBs to be genuine with them, but only on their terms. So some men dont give out a ppm when you dont have sex and then I feel like they don\u2019t actually value me, just having sex with me.\n\nThere will always be a transactional nature to this type of relationship. I feel like this feeling gets reduced the more time you spend with the other person and genuinely enjoy each other\u2019s company. My SBF does a monthly allowance and direct deposits it too my bank account. Other though are via ppm which eventually with time, my discomfort disappeared.",

I don't do well with a POT who's tapping her toes waiting for the cash before she does anything, including meeting for a cup of coffee. Now that feels way too transactional for me.",

Sugaring costs more than all but high prices escorting, the myth that SDs are trying to save money and treat SBs as low cost escorts is not only incorrect but it's being deliberately spread by escorts who want to drive up the cost of sugaring so they can get more escort clients for their lower rates.  It's pretty despicable imo.\n\nSecondly, allowance starts when the arrangement officially starts.  Just like allowance doesn't start in full at the M&G if there are platonic dates after that you haven't officially begun the arrangement, so why would you expect to receive an allowance for them?  Since the arrangement has yet to start, and neither of you is providing or receiving what you want out of an arrangement, the person that is coming out ahead on those is the SB because she at least is being treated to dinner and potentially activities.  Yes, you can get that from any guy.  SDs can have platonic dinner dates at the drop of a hat, so your reasoning isn't supported by that argument.\n\nThe fact that the narrative about not starting allowance until the SR officially has begun, which is when intimacy occurs, is also deliberate and being pushed by escorts and \"SBs\" that choose to take more than they give in a SR.  It's a simple concept, but they refuse to acknowledge it because it completely defeats their argument.",

Go enjoy your free dinners from dates - dates that clearly are not bringing you the satisfaction you seek in your existence.  Which is why you are seeking an SD, yes?\n\nSuccessful people (and this group likely constitutes the highest % of the SD community) tend to not settle for 2nd best.  If an SD, to you, is the last resort after you have exhausted your free dinner dating pool, you are looking at it the wrong way.\n\nTreat your POT SDs as #1 vs. a chore or something you will only do if you get paid enough and you will see your results improve. With results including (1) higher bank account balance; (2) awesome experiences; (3) great respect and communication.",

If they can't do that then they aren't serious or don't have the means. We were together for 1.5 years. He is a very generous person and that's what all SBs want... the real deal. \n\nI know there is a risk for SDs but a lot of the advice I've seen is to vet better. haha The SDs who have the most success are the ones who show right away what being with them would be like.",

She\u2019s new to the bowl and hasn\u2019t been in a relationship for a while, and like most of us, has some scars from prior relationships.  I\u2019ve told her no pressure, when she\u2019s ready \u2026 which I expect to be this Saturday, she\u2019s indicated she\u2019d like to spend the night.  In the meantime, we\u2019ve gotten to know each other and deepening the relationship.  I am in the bowl because I find it easier to be authentic and myself than I do in vanilla dating.  I\u2019m looking for a strong emotional connection and a SGF for the long term.  I believe that moving to allowance prior to full intimacy, plus my words of support and encouragement for some of the drama she\u2019s going thru in rl are helping us move towards the relationship I\u2019m seeking.  I\u2019ve been in the bowl a little less than a year and she\u2019s my 3rd SB.  If I stuck to PPM until full intimacy, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019d be where we are today.  For me, if I think there\u2019s a chance of forming a bond, I don\u2019t mind offering allowance early as a show of commitment.  It seems like little risk when you\u2019re taking a longer view of things.",

I personally think many women came round to treating it like escorting when men started approaching them online asking for PPM w intimacy. The thing is.....escorts I know that are not survival workers ARE screening first and they DO take safety precautions. They also treat it likes a business and don't get too chummy or comfortable with men bc if you do, you get taken advantage of and boundaries tested and pushed. Sex work (in any realm) can be very draining. They call that aspect \"emotional labor\" (and this isn't just inherent to SW of course).\n\nThe men want it both ways...if you want it to be less transactional then pay an allowance and don't treat her like she's disposable or like you're just paying for intimacy.",

So, I think the compromise is that both people have to go without the sex and the money to show that, that's not what's the actual focus of the relationship. That, that's not what's holding the relationship together and that the relationship really is genuine and real because both are willing to go without sugar to show it. Also, this way if a genuine relationship can't be built the only thing lost if it doesn't work out is time for both people. Time is something scammers and men looking for cheap escorts will never invest in.",

A man that goes about it in this was (which is basically a john) is going to turn off quality women and so it may look like a rinse (even though it's mostly a woman turned off to this energy). Women can FEEL this pressure and it pushes us away. Which is going to leave the women that ARE just ringers.

The norm these days - and even after it seemed there was some trust established.  I still believe SR boil down to 2 people wanting to spend time together.  And sometimes that mutual feeling is never there; and sometimes it is there one day and not the next.  For my best SBs, there was never a question in my mind they wanted to spend time with me and I with them. In this case, she either got greedy, found a better deal elsewhere, or just lost interest.  It happens.\n\nSB: Hey daddy, you forgot my allowance.\n\nME : Nope - surprise, surprise.  Check your pursue.\n\nSB: There's nothing in there\n\nME: I absolutely put money in your purse. Side pocket. I also saw a pen, a small notepad, and a hair tie.  So look in that pocket.\n\nSB: It's not there. It must have fallen out.\n\nME: The pocket is zipped.\n\nSB: It opens by itself all the time.\n\nME: I see. I promise, it is in there.\n\nSB: It's not. You owe me.\n\nME: Hey, I will send you the amount via PayPal just so there are no questions.  In the past, it never was an issue putting it in your purse this way for you, so I'll bite the bullet on this one.\n\nSB: Ok, thank you so much.\n\n(next meeting)\n\nME: Here you go.  $X as promised in your hand.  We don't have to worry about any purse failure situations.\n\nSB: Last time you gave me $2X\n\nME: No, last time I gave you $X which you said you never got and I was generous and understanding and sent you another $X just to be safe.\n\nSB: So you can afford $2X?\n\nME: That's not the point. Plus, you told me you couldn't find the money and that it was lost.\n\nSB: I just wasn't sure where it was from.\n\nME: So, a few days later, you found $X in your purse where I told you I put it and the magic money fairy put it there? You didn't think it was maybe from me?\n\nSB: Well, idk.\n\nME: Well, I am a little confused here.  You weren't forthcoming. And now I am not sure if you were forgetful, intentionally scamming me, or just being greedy.  We had a deal and you said it was good for you and it was good for me.  I am not trying to be cheap; I just want things to be sustainable and allow room to do a little extra from time to time.\n\nSB: Well, so you can afford $2X\n\nME: No.\n\nSB: You just want a prostitue.\n\nME: Yep, I guess so.",

I just dont treat this with a hustler mentality of figuring out what the most I can extract out of this is\n\nA lot of people have some hangups on the money aspect and I think the best way to get over that is to treat it like a boundary where I need x to enjoy the relationship. It's my standard and it's what makes me happy so that I'm not constantly hitting my SD up with my hand out. \n\nSo now, we only talk about money once a month and it's to discuss if I have any big expenses coming up before he gets me my allowance. \n\nI just want my SR to feel organic and fun and my approach has worked very well for me so far.

It's pretty obvious when they actually dont have the means for it based on the quality of the dates and where we go. The dates are another way to gauge  generosity outside of the allowance. And for those that just want a chat buddy, those are pretty easy to spot as well. Or maybe I've just developed a sense for it by slutting around craigslist and okcupid a lot before finding out about sugar dating \n\nAnd I suppose I am biased bc it took me and my SD months before we could meet up. Of course I was talking to other guys during that time too but it took my SD a few weeks before he sent me anything, and a few more after that before we met in person. I would have missed out on a wonderful relationship if I had been more mercenary.",

I personally think many women came round to treating it like escorting when men started approaching them online asking for PPM w intimacy. The thing is.....escorts I know that are not survival workers ARE screening first and they DO take safety precautions. They also treat it likes a business and don't get too chummy or comfortable with men bc if you do, you get taken advantage of and boundaries tested and pushed. Sex work (in any realm) can be very draining. They call that aspect \"emotional labor\" (and this isn't just inherent to SW of course).\n\nThe men want it both ways...if you want it to be less transactional then pay an allowance and don't treat her like she's disposable or like you're just paying for intimacy.",

In vanilla dating i never expected sex either, i just wanted to meet up to talk in public and see if there is a connection, exactly what girls say they want. But SBs in my area always say thats a waste of my time, i get scammed can you send me allowance upfront, usually gas money. And no i don\u2019t do it anymore, its just irritating zero girls actually want to meet.",

But, unfortunately that's not the reality, so all you can do is try to navigate the reality of things the best way you can. He doesn't want to risk being scammed and she doesn't want to risk being sexually used. So, I think the compromise is that both people have to go without the sex and the money to show that, that's not what's the actual focus of the relationship. That, that's not what's holding the relationship together and that the relationship really is genuine and real because both are willing to go without sugar to show it. Also, this way if a genuine relationship can't be built the only thing lost if it doesn't work out is time for both people. Time is something scammers and men looking for cheap escorts will never invest in.",

Women can FEEL this pressure and it pushes us away. Which is going to leave the women that ARE just ringers.

I just dont treat this with a hustler mentality of figuring out what the most I can extract out of this is\n\nA lot of people have some hangups on the money aspect and I think the best way to get over that is to treat it like a boundary where I need x to enjoy the relationship.

Or maybe I've just developed a sense for it by slutting around craigslist and okcupid a lot before finding out about sugar dating \n\nAnd I suppose I am biased bc it took me and my SD months before we could meet up. Of course I was talking to other guys during that time too but it took my SD a few weeks before he sent me anything, and a few more after that before we met in person.

But, unfortunately that's not the reality, so all you can do is try to navigate the reality of things the best way you can. He doesn't want to risk being scammed and she doesn't want to risk being sexually used. So, I think the compromise is that both people have to go without the sex and the money to show that, that's not what's the actual focus of the relationship. That, that's not what's holding the relationship together and that the relationship really is genuine and real because both are willing to go without sugar to show it. Also, this way if a genuine relationship can't be built the only thing lost if it doesn't work out is time for both people. Time is something scammers and men looking for cheap escorts will never invest in.",

A man that goes about it in this was (which is basically a john) is going to turn off quality women and so it may look like a rinse (even though it's mostly a woman turned off to this energy). Women can FEEL this pressure and it pushes us away. Which is going to leave the women that ARE just ringers.

And I invest my time, but I dont get emotionally attached so it's pretty chill. \n\nAnd I find the time wasters eliminate themselves early on for me. It's pretty obvious when they actually dont have the means for it based on the quality of the dates and where we go. The dates are another way to gauge  generosity outside of the allowance. And for those that just want a chat buddy, those are pretty easy to spot as well. Or maybe I've just developed a sense for it by slutting around craigslist and okcupid a lot before finding out about sugar dating \n\nAnd I suppose I am biased bc it took me and my SD months before we could meet up. Of course I was talking to other guys during that time too but it took my SD a few weeks before he sent me anything, and a few more after that before we met in person. I would have missed out on a wonderful relationship if I had been more mercenary.",

I'm not asking for anything before a meeting. Not even necessarily on the first. But if we kiss and he grabs my boob on the second date, isn't it fair to assume that I'm interested and at this point a little sugar would be appreciated?",

You show up, I show up, in a safe public place with lots of people around, and we see if there is a connection, then progress. And no i do not expect intimacy right away like i have said  100 times, its not even the issue. Meeting up the way i describe needs to be an unsaid given.",

But, unfortunately that's not the reality, so all you can do is try to navigate the reality of things the best way you can.

So, I think the compromise is that both people have to go without the sex and the money to show that, that's not what's the actual focus of the relationship. That, that's not what's holding the relationship together and that the relationship really is genuine and real because both are willing to go without sugar to show it. Also, this way if a genuine relationship can't be built the only thing lost if it doesn't work out is time for both people. Time is something scammers and men looking for cheap escorts will never invest in.",

It's pretty obvious when they actually dont have the means for it based on the quality of the dates and where we go. The dates are another way to gauge  generosity outside of the allowance. And for those that just want a chat buddy, those are pretty easy to spot as well. Or maybe I've just developed a sense for it by slutting around craigslist and okcupid a lot before finding out about sugar dating \n\nAnd I suppose I am biased bc it took me and my SD months before we could meet up. Of course I was talking to other guys during that time too but it took my SD a few weeks before he sent me anything, and a few more after that before we met in person. I would have missed out on a wonderful relationship if I had been more mercenary.",

So, I think the compromise is that both people have to go without the sex and the money to show that, that's not what's the actual focus of the relationship. That, that's not what's holding the relationship together and that the relationship really is genuine and real because both are willing to go without sugar to show it. Also, this way if a genuine relationship can't be built the only thing lost if it doesn't work out is time for both people. Time is something scammers and men looking for cheap escorts will never invest in.",

But, unfortunately that's not the reality, so all you can do is try to navigate the reality of things the best way you can.

So, I think the compromise is that both people have to go without the sex and the money to show that, that's not what's the actual focus of the relationship. That, that's not what's holding the relationship together and that the relationship really is genuine and real because both are willing to go without sugar to show it. Also, this way if a genuine relationship can't be built the only thing lost if it doesn't work out is time for both people. Time is something scammers and men looking for cheap escorts will never invest in.",

But, unfortunately that's not the reality, so all you can do is try to navigate the reality of things the best way you can. He doesn't want to risk being scammed and she doesn't want to risk being sexually used. So, I think the compromise is that both people have to go without the sex and the money to show that, that's not what's the actual focus of the relationship. That, that's not what's holding the relationship together and that the relationship really is genuine and real because both are willing to go without sugar to show it. Also, this way if a genuine relationship can't be built the only thing lost if it doesn't work out is time for both people. Time is something scammers and men looking for cheap escorts will never invest in.",

But, unfortunately that's not the reality, so all you can do is try to navigate the reality of things the best way you can. He doesn't want to risk being scammed and she doesn't want to risk being sexually used. So, I think the compromise is that both people have to go without the sex and the money to show that, that's not what's the actual focus of the relationship. That, that's not what's holding the relationship together and that the relationship really is genuine and real because both are willing to go without sugar to show it. Also, this way if a genuine relationship can't be built the only thing lost if it doesn't work out is time for both people. Time is something scammers and men looking for cheap escorts will never invest in.",

He doesn't want to risk being scammed and she doesn't want to risk being sexually used. So, I think the compromise is that both people have to go without the sex and the money to show that, that's not what's the actual focus of the relationship. That, that's not what's holding the relationship together and that the relationship really is genuine and real because both are willing to go without sugar to show it. Also, this way if a genuine relationship can't be built the only thing lost if it doesn't work out is time for both people. Time is something scammers and men looking for cheap escorts will never invest in.",
