If you're up for it, I've got some completely unsolicited suggestions you could take with a pinch of salt :P\n\nI think that now you just need to keep the rest in trim - I'd keep some facial hair to properly frame your face now that you've shaved the top.\n\nYou could try and grow out a proper beard, but like me you don't have the part that connects the mustache to the beard - I would get rid of the strands inbetween your mustache and below, to properly separate them with clear edges. I think the mustache would look better if trimmed at the edges so that the ends line up above the corners of your mouth, not hanging over like currently, then try growing out the length a little more.\n\nYou can also clean up the part under your mouth, trim the left and right sides where there are only wisps so that only the thicker part in the center connects your bottom lip to your beard - or get rid of it entirely.\n\nPut your shaver on a 1 or 2 to keep your sideburns short, then with no guard or even a razor follow the edge to make the edges nice and flat/curved - no gradient between hair and no hair areas, just a nice neat line. You can experiment with growing out your beard to see how it would look on you, or perhaps try a goatee if all else fails.\n\nI think you'll look even better if you have a little trim, looking forward to a finale shot! :))\n\nEdit: again, just suggestions :P",
