Instead, the group said, they must also invest in their employees, protect the environment and deal fairly and ethically with their suppliers.\"\n\nMaybe it's just a smoke screen and wont ever amount to anything but I'd like to think its a baby step in the right direction.

I will read them on the train.\n\nIt's hard to hold that statement at face value when you read stories like Amazon warehouse employees being forced to not pee or get deducted pay. \n\nWhat does it mean to \"invest in their employees, protect the environment and deal fairly and ethically with their suppliers.\"? That statement isn't specific enough to be effective. \n\nFor example, at the fundamental level for a company to \"invest in their employees\" the employee would have to stick around for a while. How could that happen if the trend is no longer to work at the same job for 20 years? Hell, if you work at the same company for 5 years you're negatively judged for it.\n\nAdditionally, it's been said that by 2026, there will be more independent contractors than employees. I bet \"employees\" will only be high level executives, and the independent contractors will be everyone else. They're just changing the verbiage but keeping everything else the same.",

Saying she could have done things differently is not saying it was her fault.    That is political correctness gone mad.\n\nThe victim was extremely courageous to go to the police.

If that's what you read from my comment then I'd suggest reading again. Its wider than just the particulars of this story. The crux is that not looking after your personal information before you get to know someone, both for SB's and SD's, can lead to dangerous and scary blackmail scenarios and saying 'There's nothing you can do, it can happen anyway' is wrong and could prevent another newbie from learning from this scenario. \n\n>You\u2019ll notice she went to the police any way, which would indicate she didn\u2019t really care if this complete lunatic called her mom.\n\nNo, it indicated that she knew he had the dangerous combination of being crazy and also having enough information to ruin her life and that her mother knowing was the least of her worries at this point.\n\n>All that said I agree about not bringing someone home if you don\u2019t trust them. I just don\u2019t necessarily think it will prevent this situation. It would have changed the location and the nature of the threats.\n\nOf course it could have prevented *elements of* the situation!

Instead, the group said, they must also invest in their employees, protect the environment and deal fairly and ethically with their suppliers.\"\n\nMaybe it's just a smoke screen and wont ever amount to anything but I'd like to think its a baby step in the right direction.

That statement isn't specific enough to be effective. \n\nFor example, at the fundamental level for a company to \"invest in their employees\" the employee would have to stick around for a while. How could that happen if the trend is no longer to work at the same job for 20 years? Hell, if you work at the same company for 5 years you're negatively judged for it.\n\nAdditionally, it's been said that by 2026, there will be more independent contractors than employees. I bet \"employees\" will only be high level executives, and the independent contractors will be everyone else. They're just changing the verbiage but keeping everything else the same.",

If that's what you read from my comment then I'd suggest reading again. Its wider than just the particulars of this story. The crux is that not looking after your personal information before you get to know someone, both for SB's and SD's, can lead to dangerous and scary blackmail scenarios and saying 'There's nothing you can do, it can happen anyway' is wrong and could prevent another newbie from learning from this scenario. \n\n>You\u2019ll notice she went to the police any way, which would indicate she didn\u2019t really care if this complete lunatic called her mom.\n\nNo, it indicated that she knew he had the dangerous combination of being crazy and also having enough information to ruin her life and that her mother knowing was the least of her worries at this point.\n\n>All that said I agree about not bringing someone home if you don\u2019t trust them. I just don\u2019t necessarily think it will prevent this situation. It would have changed the location and the nature of the threats.\n\nOf course it could have prevented *elements of* the situation! If he didn't have that information, there would have been no way to contact or trace her after the first horrible meet. That's not to blame her at all but to encourage other newbies to take heed.",

That statement isn't specific enough to be effective. \n\nFor example, at the fundamental level for a company to \"invest in their employees\" the employee would have to stick around for a while. How could that happen if the trend is no longer to work at the same job for 20 years? Hell, if you work at the same company for 5 years you're negatively judged for it.\n\nAdditionally, it's been said that by 2026, there will be more independent contractors than employees. I bet \"employees\" will only be high level executives, and the independent contractors will be everyone else. They're just changing the verbiage but keeping everything else the same.",

Saying she could have done things differently is not saying it was her fault.    That is political correctness gone mad.\n\nThe victim was extremely courageous to go to the police.  Many women would not have gone to the police out of fear of exposing their Sugar lifestyle.  I'm sure Fabrizio was betting on that.",

If that's what you read from my comment then I'd suggest reading again. Its wider than just the particulars of this story. The crux is that not looking after your personal information before you get to know someone, both for SB's and SD's, can lead to dangerous and scary blackmail scenarios and saying 'There's nothing you can do, it can happen anyway' is wrong and could prevent another newbie from learning from this scenario. \n\n>You\u2019ll notice she went to the police any way, which would indicate she didn\u2019t really care if this complete lunatic called her mom.\n\nNo, it indicated that she knew he had the dangerous combination of being crazy and also having enough information to ruin her life and that her mother knowing was the least of her worries at this point.\n\n>All that said I agree about not bringing someone home if you don\u2019t trust them. I just don\u2019t necessarily think it will prevent this situation. It would have changed the location and the nature of the threats.\n\nOf course it could have prevented *elements of* the situation! If he didn't have that information, there would have been no way to contact or trace her after the first horrible meet. That's not to blame her at all but to encourage other newbies to take heed.",

That statement isn't specific enough to be effective. \n\nFor example, at the fundamental level for a company to \"invest in their employees\" the employee would have to stick around for a while. How could that happen if the trend is no longer to work at the same job for 20 years? Hell, if you work at the same company for 5 years you're negatively judged for it.\n\nAdditionally, it's been said that by 2026, there will be more independent contractors than employees. I bet \"employees\" will only be high level executives, and the independent contractors will be everyone else. They're just changing the verbiage but keeping everything else the same.",

If that's what you read from my comment then I'd suggest reading again. Its wider than just the particulars of this story. The crux is that not looking after your personal information before you get to know someone, both for SB's and SD's, can lead to dangerous and scary blackmail scenarios and saying 'There's nothing you can do, it can happen anyway' is wrong and could prevent another newbie from learning from this scenario. \n\n>You\u2019ll notice she went to the police any way, which would indicate she didn\u2019t really care if this complete lunatic called her mom.\n\nNo, it indicated that she knew he had the dangerous combination of being crazy and also having enough information to ruin her life and that her mother knowing was the least of her worries at this point.\n\n>All that said I agree about not bringing someone home if you don\u2019t trust them. I just don\u2019t necessarily think it will prevent this situation. It would have changed the location and the nature of the threats.\n\nOf course it could have prevented *elements of* the situation! If he didn't have that information, there would have been no way to contact or trace her after the first horrible meet. That's not to blame her at all but to encourage other newbies to take heed.",

If that's what you read from my comment then I'd suggest reading again. Its wider than just the particulars of this story. The crux is that not looking after your personal information before you get to know someone, both for SB's and SD's, can lead to dangerous and scary blackmail scenarios and saying 'There's nothing you can do, it can happen anyway' is wrong and could prevent another newbie from learning from this scenario. \n\n>You\u2019ll notice she went to the police any way, which would indicate she didn\u2019t really care if this complete lunatic called her mom.\n\nNo, it indicated that she knew he had the dangerous combination of being crazy and also having enough information to ruin her life and that her mother knowing was the least of her worries at this point.\n\n>All that said I agree about not bringing someone home if you don\u2019t trust them. I just don\u2019t necessarily think it will prevent this situation. It would have changed the location and the nature of the threats.\n\nOf course it could have prevented *elements of* the situation! If he didn't have that information, there would have been no way to contact or trace her after the first horrible meet. That's not to blame her at all but to encourage other newbies to take heed.",

This is not victim shaming and people need to quit using that argument.   If we can't learn how people got into trouble, we can't help prevent other people from getting into that same trouble.   Saying she could have done things differently is not saying it was her fault.    That is political correctness gone mad.\n\nThe victim was extremely courageous to go to the police.  Many women would not have gone to the police out of fear of exposing their Sugar lifestyle.  I'm sure Fabrizio was betting on that.",
