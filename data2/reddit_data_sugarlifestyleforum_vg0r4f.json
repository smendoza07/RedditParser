    "body": "It's Father's Day and I made plans with my Dad for the next few days since he's visiting me. I wasn't expecting any POT SDs to reach out to me but one did. He was indirectly making hints to see me, but never planned an actual date.  I told him I would like to see him on my day off so we would have more time together. He was attempting to do a spontaneous m&g with this sense of urgency (most likely wanted sex before he leaves for work). He travels out of state for work from time to time. POT SD's availability was for today and tomorrow. \n\nI asked him *\"If I can squeeze you in tomorrow would you be okay with that? What did you have planned for us?\"*\n\nHe got upset at the small, innocent phrase of *\"squeeze you in.\"* He also got upset at me for me wanting to spend time with my Dad and thought his high PPM could sway me into cancelling plans with my father. These C-suite level men and their tempers...\n\nI tried twice suggesting what days to see him. He shot them both down. It's out of my hands and I'm okay with that. I get to eat steak with my Dad. <3",

He only had Sunday (yesterday, which we had just started talking) and Monday (which I have plans). I was trying to be considerate to try to see him on Monday, if I could.
