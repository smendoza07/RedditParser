There is nothing stated about him starving to death, and in any story it's generally assumed that the world functions like reality unless explicitly stated otherwise. Yes, it's *possible* they let his head do things severed heads can't do despite his abilities not being made for that, but aside from him not dying from stuff he is *specifically* built to not die from, there is not much to support the idea. So unless he comes back in Boruto and says he could do that himself, he's dead. Using something that is only *technically* possible because it doesn't contradict what already been said is usually only done for personal headcanons. If that how you want to see it, then fine, no problem. As far as canon is concerned though, he's dead.",

One of narutos strong points in the first place was how well the fillers were, because if you were anime only you wouldn't be able to tell the difference at times (besides the funny gag fillers).

In shippuden and OG you had amazing fights and suddenly they jumped to some crazy filler about kid Naruto trying to capture some ostrich ???\nAnd even that filler is half of Shippuden I would never call shippuden a bad show. \nAlso, in my personal opinion I like boruto\u2019s filler slightly more because as most of the show is still filler they had to make them a little bit better. The only two arc of filler that I really hate in boruto are those about Cho Cho and the movie star and the one where Mitsuki ran away from the village.\nStill the best filler- and maybe the only one that is really good- is Kakashi Anbu Arc. This one totally looked not as a filler and was really enjoyable to watch",

Didn't like the first half with kabuto, but the final scenes were amazing. \n\nBorutos filler was dog shit. I didn't really like any of the filler in boruto, which so happens to take up the whole series. The problem with borutos filler is that the filler could be a series all on its own, and it IS a series on its own since, again, there's only like 1 canon arc in boruto, and when I stopped watching boruto there was 0 cannon arcs (150 episodes of straight filler) so it really is just a filler series that isn't canon to a good story. \n\nYou can judge boruto off its filler since the whole show is filler. Almost every episode is pure filler, nothing more. By your logic of not judging boruto off its filler, you'd either have to skip literally over 150 episodes in a row, and go straight to the first canon arc which is like ep 160 or something (idk i don't keep up with shit) or just not judge boruto at all. \n\nIm gonna judge it off its filler, since by the time I stopped watching, it was only filler, meaning it was a legit series but none of it was canon to Naruto so it was its own separate anime universe (thats how anime works. Not every anime series is connected to eachother. They are there own universes) \n\nBoruto is shit, you can't change my mind on that because its just fax, just as much fax as humans will never fully understand the universe since its literally imposible",

Also, the anime said that shikadai became a chunin and set up this whole system of where chunin jonin and genin get there missions on separate levels, then immediately contracticted that in the episode which was shit. \n\nThe difference between skipping Naruto filler and boruto filler is that Naruto filler is normally less then 15 episodes at a time for each filler arc, so your only skipping like 15, at most 20 episodes, at a time which is reasonable for any anime, but in borutos case your skipping 160 episodes all at once, which is just ridiculous. At that point your better off just making a new series. I don't plan on going back to boruto any time soon because I'm still tramitized by the character designs and the utter shit that it was (aswell as the voice acting because im a dub watcher and did eventually skip to sub after ep 54 but I didn't like either) as well as the story. \n\nAnd borutos bitchyness.

Also, the anime said that shikadai became a chunin and set up this whole system of where chunin jonin and genin get there missions on separate levels, then immediately contracticted that in the episode which was shit. \n\nThe difference between skipping Naruto filler and boruto filler is that Naruto filler is normally less then 15 episodes at a time for each filler arc, so your only skipping like 15, at most 20 episodes, at a time which is reasonable for any anime, but in borutos case your skipping 160 episodes all at once, which is just ridiculous. At that point your better off just making a new series. I don't plan on going back to boruto any time soon because I'm still tramitized by the character designs and the utter shit that it was (aswell as the voice acting because im a dub watcher and did eventually skip to sub after ep 54 but I didn't like either) as well as the story. \n\nAnd borutos bitchyness. He needs to grow the fuck up.",

I understand boruto getting the final attack on that otsosuki in the movie because that rasengan was made from Narutos Chakra, and Naruto wanted boruto to get battle experience, but every other time a genin other then Mitsuki defeats a high level oponet, I have to punch my screen.",

At Naruto's peak the character writing was second to none and that seeped into everything: world-building, story, and fights. The Pain arc is considered the peak of Naruto because the character writing is molded by the world-building, drives the story, and is expressed in the fights.\n\nI don't really see any of that in Boruto. Boruto ignores Naruto's worldbuilding and doesn't really make a dedicated effort to make its own. It just assumes that you should know things. The character writing is a shadow of Naruto's as most characters don't feel very driven and their conflicts feel shallow rather than entrenched in the world. The power-scaling feels ridiculous even by Naruto standards with 12-year-old Boruto landing saving the day and landing the finishing blow on an Otsutsuki. The most ridiculous Naruto ever got in that aspect was having 12-year-old Konohamaru take down a stationary Pain body, while it was distracted and had its guard down.",

And about that sci-fi sequel, I love that idea but it\u2019s hard to imagine it now with Boruto already there. \n\nAbout the characters\u2019 drives, you can\u2019t see it as much as you did in Naruto since they don\u2019t have tragic backstories but rather make their life moving forward tragic, I like that approach honestly because it feels fresh and new. \n\nAbout Boruto forgetting why people liked Naruto, I think Kishimoto was going for a different approach when it comes to writing Boruto, it\u2019d be boring if he did the same thing both for him and the fans. \n\nNow the last bit makes a lot of sense since a kid beating someone above kaguya level is insane, but I think that\u2019s setting up what Boruto will fight in the future, kinda like how Naruto defeated Garra which then built up fighting for tailed beasts and stuff.",

Heck, the Kishimoto manga chapters haven't even made it into the anime yet (Kishimoto's first chapter was in January 2021). The people who made Boruto were Kishimoto's assistants who were put in charge of a Naruto sequel after Kishimoto refused. But taking over a manga five years into it is kind of too late to really mold it into something you want so even with Kishimoto continuing the story it's not really his story, especially when he has to write his way to the flash-forward as well, which makes the path even more rigid.\n\nAlso, I don't mind times when Boruto outshines Naruto or Sasuke but it has to happen realistically. When Kakashi got caught by Zabuza, Naruto and Sasuke devised a way to free Kakashi rather than take on Zabuza themselves. In Boruto it seems that Boruto needs to fight the big bad himself rather than doing something to help the more powerful combatant. Also, power escalation isn't happening naturally in Boruto, if you read the manga you know. Kishimoto made things a lot worse in that aspect.",

If I\u2019m going to start a show and like episode 5 or 10 is already filler, that\u2019s just terrible and the anime shouldn\u2019t have even started yet or the directors are smoking that good shit. \n\nBoruto already has a high filler to cannon percentage but the show is nowhere near as long. It makes it way harder to even want to watch it, also the show started strong and stayed strong for a good while story wise.\n\nFirst we have the sasuke introduction, then we see how far the trio has come and we see how crazy fucking strong they are now including Sakura and the hype was off the rails for the first season. Boruto starts off cool, then immediately goes downhill into filler and into boruto who is a snot nosed brat and then we have Sarada whos just a watered down not as interesting sasuke.\nEtc etc\n\nIt\u2019s just nowhere near as hype or interesting when the characters predecessors are wayyyy more interesting than themselves. Why watch it when the previous seasons are literally more interesting? They nerf our past characters so the new ones can do interesting stuff but it just comes off as lame and hand waving, the characters are essentially the same as their parents but more cringey, the animation isn\u2019t even as good, the music isn\u2019t as good, the villains aren\u2019t as interesting. \n\nI just don\u2019t see why SHOULD you watch boruto?",

Anything that wasn't in the manga is shit.\n\nThe problem with that logic is the \"filler\" in Boruto was designed specifically to progress the series to a certain point. The writers had to come up with their own content during the beginning of the series to introduce the characters, the world, and the plot. It isn't anywhere near comparable to something like the Ostrich episode from Naruto.\n\nAre there portions where the filler *is* bad? Sure. But Naruto has had worse quality fillers and filler arcs.",

Making a show and then immediately making filler does not help a shows story whatsoever which is absolutely crucial to the beginning of the story especially when boruto already has a slow story even in the manga itself so the filler makes the story even slower and more boring.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t allow the story to go anywhere and why should I watch a show where it takes 80 episodes to actually get anywhere; it\u2019s my same gripe I have with one piece where the story can feel absolutely stagnant and takes way too long to actually tell the story they want to tell. There hasn\u2019t been a single arc in boruto that\u2019s been as hype as say the original chunin exams or the sasuke arc yet they add seasons of filler, they expect the consumer to watch filler for a show that barely has moved in its story.

Ex:\n\n* Addition of the Jougan\n* Toneri making an appearance\n* Larger *permanent* cast of characters that aren't for one-off filler episodes\n* Sumire actually receiving a backstory\n* Sarada receving a backstory as to how she got the Sharingan\n* Sarada's family backstory\n* Info on Orochimaru and Taka's whereabouts\n* Mitsuki's Backstory\n* Mitsuki's Sage Mode\n* Boruto learning how to use the abilities that he suddenly learned in the manga with 0 explanation\n* Team 7 actually going on missions and getting development together\n* Countless other smaller details that the anime adds to make the story feel more complete\n\nAlso the fact that you claimed they were taking \"another artists work\" when the writer of the Boruto manga not only played a giant role in the first arc of the anime but also personally wrote that and another anime-only arc into a novelization. He's literally credited as a script supervisor for the Boruto anime *to this day*, even though he's not on the manga's team anymore.",

It's easily understandable just how garbage this fight is. Sakura vs Shin ? The fight that it took 5 minutes for prince in the white horse to arrive and save her ass ? Kawaki vs Deepa/Boruto vs Ao are standard shonen anime fights you could find in literally every single show. Boruto vs Nue ? Pfft, Okay in that case Mecha Naruto vs Naruto is a good fight too. Jigen vs Naruto/Sasuke can't br even considered a fight, they nerfed Naruto and Sasuke both to the ground. The single and only fight i and a lot of other old fans agree to be at least decent is Momo vs Naruto/Sasuke.\n\nThe rest of the fights either completely ignore or ruin the power scale, or is just your average shounen anime fight. Fyi my example of a good fight is Kakashi vs Zabuza, the fight which introduced us to so many things and explained a lot of stuff, had good animation for it's time and pushed the team 7 as characters lots",

No fuxk no \n\nCan't handle the truth can't ya ? Just like how i consider all these fight bad you also think of all Boruto's fight as awesome, so please shut your mouth,  if I'm biased you are also too.\n\nIronic how you think Naruto's fandom is the most toxic when Boruto's sub exists, People absolutely downvote anything that doesn't praise the superiority of Boruto.

Sadge bruh\n\nI Don't care about anime, in the manga he hasn't done shit without he's karma. Karma is easily the single must bs power i have ever seen in the Naruto universe, how did Boruto get it ? He used the rasengan Naruto gave him, for some random reason Momo could without any touching mark Karma on boruto Boruto, without any explanation Karma has the op abilities like absorbing chakra, teleport, increasing the users physical ability, whatever Karma is compatible with your body or not is also based on your luck, we never got an explanation on why Kawaki and Boruto could become a vessel but somehow Code received another asspull named White karma. \n\nKurama presence made Narutos chakra unstable, meaning if he wasn't there Naruto would've an easier time channelling he's own chakra and cast jutsu. Kurama alone was like  50% of he's power, he has the sage mode, he's an uzumaki which means a lot chakra and life force, he's also a prodigy since he was the person to complete the rasengan, a feat which he's father genius father couldn't.\n\nAh yes my favorite excuse of all-time, hE's A gEniUs sO hE dOesN't nEEd to tRAiN. mInAto gEnEs sKipPeD a gEneRatIon, nAruTo sTuPid bOritto pRodiGy, he accidentally made the vanishing rasengan xD...

So you ignore the anime which fleshed out the characters the world and the lore and focus on the manga which is pretty much a skeleton for the anime the manga is monthly with only 60 chapters how do you expect it to go as in detail as the anime? And karma has to be compatible with the user that\u2019s why Isshiki went through the trouble of looking for Kawaki and Momoshiki literally said Boruto was a perfect vessel and heavily inherited the otsutsuki genes and I never said anything about Boruto being a prodigy because of naruto I said if he wasn\u2019t a prodigy people would\u2019ve been mad and your trying to equate real life biology to a fictional world kakashi literally says that Boruto inherited Minatos Genius and narutos unpredictability so that\u2019s not necessarily true and we know that if you have a powerful parent your most likely to have a higher potential then when compared to a person that comes from a weaker parent",

Ao vs Boruto we saw Boruto struggle first hand with seeing how being a ninja has effected a veteran shinobi during this time we also see Boruto\u2019s struggle with mugino\u2019s death how it made him more resolved etc Kawaki vs Garou was 1 an introduction to Kawaki but also an introduction to Karma and how lethal it can really be this is also around the time Boruto first activates karma team 7 vs Deepa another example of a good fight not only was it decently choreographed but Deepas character was interesting hes what everyone wanted urashiki to be that battle not only introduced us to Kara but it also effected team 7 they realized that they where weak while being considered prodigies in the face of power all of it was meaningless that battle pushed them to train harder then they every did specially Boruto after that loss he trained day and night for some Days so he could find a way to defeat deepa it all made them more resolved after that battle Boruto began analyzing the situation more and pushed him to want to actually get stronger all the fights I sent you where well choreographed gave us more information developed the characters and where entertaining",

I think Boruto as a show has already suffered that fate given it\u2019s reputation among Naruto fans. Doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t still be an enjoyable story, but if you lose your target audience in the beginning, something\u2019s gone wrong.\n\nEdit: wording to be more objective (although people\u2019s enjoyment of any show are entirely subjective!)",

There is nothing stated about him starving to death, and in any story it's generally assumed that the world functions like reality unless explicitly stated otherwise. Yes, it's *possible* they let his head do things severed heads can't do despite his abilities not being made for that, but aside from him not dying from stuff he is *specifically* built to not die from, there is not much to support the idea. So unless he comes back in Boruto and says he could do that himself, he's dead. Using something that is only *technically* possible because it doesn't contradict what already been said is usually only done for personal headcanons. If that how you want to see it, then fine, no problem. As far as canon is concerned though, he's dead.",

It doesn't matter if it was filler or not. One of narutos strong points in the first place was how well the fillers were, because if you were anime only you wouldn't be able to tell the difference at times (besides the funny gag fillers).

In shippuden and OG you had amazing fights and suddenly they jumped to some crazy filler about kid Naruto trying to capture some ostrich ???\nAnd even that filler is half of Shippuden I would never call shippuden a bad show. \nAlso, in my personal opinion I like boruto\u2019s filler slightly more because as most of the show is still filler they had to make them a little bit better. The only two arc of filler that I really hate in boruto are those about Cho Cho and the movie star and the one where Mitsuki ran away from the village.\nStill the best filler- and maybe the only one that is really good- is Kakashi Anbu Arc. This one totally looked not as a filler and was really enjoyable to watch",

Didn't like the first half with kabuto, but the final scenes were amazing. \n\nBorutos filler was dog shit. I didn't really like any of the filler in boruto, which so happens to take up the whole series. The problem with borutos filler is that the filler could be a series all on its own, and it IS a series on its own since, again, there's only like 1 canon arc in boruto, and when I stopped watching boruto there was 0 cannon arcs (150 episodes of straight filler) so it really is just a filler series that isn't canon to a good story. \n\nYou can judge boruto off its filler since the whole show is filler. Almost every episode is pure filler, nothing more. By your logic of not judging boruto off its filler, you'd either have to skip literally over 150 episodes in a row, and go straight to the first canon arc which is like ep 160 or something (idk i don't keep up with shit) or just not judge boruto at all. \n\nIm gonna judge it off its filler, since by the time I stopped watching, it was only filler, meaning it was a legit series but none of it was canon to Naruto so it was its own separate anime universe (thats how anime works. Not every anime series is connected to eachother. They are there own universes) \n\nBoruto is shit, you can't change my mind on that because its just fax, just as much fax as humans will never fully understand the universe since its literally imposible",

I am not here to change your mind, I understand it\u2019s frustrating to watch 150 episodes of filler, but you logic doesn\u2019t make sense to me because Naruto Shippuden and OG Naruto are 55% and 41% filler, consecutively. So I\u2019d have to considerer these two amazing shows as s*it too because of their long fillers, what is not the case. And yes, a lot of people jump hundreds of Naruto episode to not watch the filler, so ig it\u2019s pretty legit to do so in boruto if you want to. \nAgain, it\u2019s mainly the studio fault for not waiting the manga to create more content to the anime, but I just don\u2019t consider boruto s*it cause I read the manga and watched the canon content they have still now and I can say sincerely that it\u2019s one of the best content they have in the Naruto franchise as a whole. \nBut again I understand and respect your opinion, but I just advise you to watch now at least some of the new canon content, which is pretty good.",

Also, the anime said that shikadai became a chunin and set up this whole system of where chunin jonin and genin get there missions on separate levels, then immediately contracticted that in the episode which was shit. \n\nThe difference between skipping Naruto filler and boruto filler is that Naruto filler is normally less then 15 episodes at a time for each filler arc, so your only skipping like 15, at most 20 episodes, at a time which is reasonable for any anime, but in borutos case your skipping 160 episodes all at once, which is just ridiculous. At that point your better off just making a new series. I don't plan on going back to boruto any time soon because I'm still tramitized by the character designs and the utter shit that it was (aswell as the voice acting because im a dub watcher and did eventually skip to sub after ep 54 but I didn't like either) as well as the story. \n\nAnd borutos bitchyness.

Also, the anime said that shikadai became a chunin and set up this whole system of where chunin jonin and genin get there missions on separate levels, then immediately contracticted that in the episode which was shit. \n\nThe difference between skipping Naruto filler and boruto filler is that Naruto filler is normally less then 15 episodes at a time for each filler arc, so your only skipping like 15, at most 20 episodes, at a time which is reasonable for any anime, but in borutos case your skipping 160 episodes all at once, which is just ridiculous. At that point your better off just making a new series. I don't plan on going back to boruto any time soon because I'm still tramitized by the character designs and the utter shit that it was (aswell as the voice acting because im a dub watcher and did eventually skip to sub after ep 54 but I didn't like either) as well as the story. \n\nAnd borutos bitchyness. He needs to grow the fuck up.",

I didn't really like any of the filler in boruto, which so happens to take up the whole series.

Almost every episode is pure filler, nothing more. By your logic of not judging boruto off its filler, you'd either have to skip literally over 150 episodes in a row, and go straight to the first canon arc which is like ep 160 or something (idk i don't keep up with shit) or just not judge boruto at all. \n\nIm gonna judge it off its filler, since by the time I stopped watching, it was only filler, meaning it was a legit series but none of it was canon to Naruto so it was its own separate anime universe (thats how anime works.

Power scalling in Naruto was similar because it did have genin defeating high level shinobi, but it was always by strategy and technique. Besides Naruto, but he used the 9 tails to defeat high level ninja that he can't beat normally. Boruto doesn't have that. I understand boruto getting the final attack on that otsosuki in the movie because that rasengan was made from Narutos Chakra, and Naruto wanted boruto to get battle experience, but every other time a genin other then Mitsuki defeats a high level oponet, I have to punch my screen.",

At Naruto's peak the character writing was second to none and that seeped into everything: world-building, story, and fights. The Pain arc is considered the peak of Naruto because the character writing is molded by the world-building, drives the story, and is expressed in the fights.\n\nI don't really see any of that in Boruto. Boruto ignores Naruto's worldbuilding and doesn't really make a dedicated effort to make its own. It just assumes that you should know things. The character writing is a shadow of Naruto's as most characters don't feel very driven and their conflicts feel shallow rather than entrenched in the world. The power-scaling feels ridiculous even by Naruto standards with 12-year-old Boruto landing saving the day and landing the finishing blow on an Otsutsuki. The most ridiculous Naruto ever got in that aspect was having 12-year-old Konohamaru take down a stationary Pain body, while it was distracted and had its guard down.",

And about that sci-fi sequel, I love that idea but it\u2019s hard to imagine it now with Boruto already there. \n\nAbout the characters\u2019 drives, you can\u2019t see it as much as you did in Naruto since they don\u2019t have tragic backstories but rather make their life moving forward tragic, I like that approach honestly because it feels fresh and new. \n\nAbout Boruto forgetting why people liked Naruto, I think Kishimoto was going for a different approach when it comes to writing Boruto, it\u2019d be boring if he did the same thing both for him and the fans. \n\nNow the last bit makes a lot of sense since a kid beating someone above kaguya level is insane, but I think that\u2019s setting up what Boruto will fight in the future, kinda like how Naruto defeated Garra which then built up fighting for tailed beasts and stuff.",

Heck, the Kishimoto manga chapters haven't even made it into the anime yet (Kishimoto's first chapter was in January 2021). The people who made Boruto were Kishimoto's assistants who were put in charge of a Naruto sequel after Kishimoto refused. But taking over a manga five years into it is kind of too late to really mold it into something you want so even with Kishimoto continuing the story it's not really his story, especially when he has to write his way to the flash-forward as well, which makes the path even more rigid.\n\nAlso, I don't mind times when Boruto outshines Naruto or Sasuke but it has to happen realistically. When Kakashi got caught by Zabuza, Naruto and Sasuke devised a way to free Kakashi rather than take on Zabuza themselves. In Boruto it seems that Boruto needs to fight the big bad himself rather than doing something to help the more powerful combatant. Also, power escalation isn't happening naturally in Boruto, if you read the manga you know. Kishimoto made things a lot worse in that aspect.",

If I\u2019m going to start a show and like episode 5 or 10 is already filler, that\u2019s just terrible and the anime shouldn\u2019t have even started yet or the directors are smoking that good shit. \n\nBoruto already has a high filler to cannon percentage but the show is nowhere near as long. It makes it way harder to even want to watch it, also the show started strong and stayed strong for a good while story wise.\n\nFirst we have the sasuke introduction, then we see how far the trio has come and we see how crazy fucking strong they are now including Sakura and the hype was off the rails for the first season. Boruto starts off cool, then immediately goes downhill into filler and into boruto who is a snot nosed brat and then we have Sarada whos just a watered down not as interesting sasuke.\nEtc etc\n\nIt\u2019s just nowhere near as hype or interesting when the characters predecessors are wayyyy more interesting than themselves. Why watch it when the previous seasons are literally more interesting? They nerf our past characters so the new ones can do interesting stuff but it just comes off as lame and hand waving, the characters are essentially the same as their parents but more cringey, the animation isn\u2019t even as good, the music isn\u2019t as good, the villains aren\u2019t as interesting. \n\nI just don\u2019t see why SHOULD you watch boruto?",

Anything that wasn't in the manga is shit.\n\nThe problem with that logic is the \"filler\" in Boruto was designed specifically to progress the series to a certain point. The writers had to come up with their own content during the beginning of the series to introduce the characters, the world, and the plot. It isn't anywhere near comparable to something like the Ostrich episode from Naruto.\n\nAre there portions where the filler *is* bad? Sure. But Naruto has had worse quality fillers and filler arcs.",

But when there\u2019s more filler than actual content and you only just started your show then yes there\u2019s a problem. \n\nYou\u2019re taking another artists work and adding fluff to it that 90% of the time doesn\u2019t actually add anything to it that the original story does have. Making a show and then immediately making filler does not help a shows story whatsoever which is absolutely crucial to the beginning of the story especially when boruto already has a slow story even in the manga itself so the filler makes the story even slower and more boring.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t allow the story to go anywhere and why should I watch a show where it takes 80 episodes to actually get anywhere; it\u2019s my same gripe I have with one piece where the story can feel absolutely stagnant and takes way too long to actually tell the story they want to tell. There hasn\u2019t been a single arc in boruto that\u2019s been as hype as say the original chunin exams or the sasuke arc yet they add seasons of filler, they expect the consumer to watch filler for a show that barely has moved in its story. To me that\u2019s basically spitting in the consumers face and just downright stupid.",

Come on man you and me both know that's a lie. There are tonnes of important stuff that is in the filler episodes that isn't in the manga. Ex:\n\n* Addition of the Jougan\n* Toneri making an appearance\n* Larger *permanent* cast of characters that aren't for one-off filler episodes\n* Sumire actually receiving a backstory\n* Sarada receving a backstory as to how she got the Sharingan\n* Sarada's family backstory\n* Info on Orochimaru and Taka's whereabouts\n* Mitsuki's Backstory\n* Mitsuki's Sage Mode\n* Boruto learning how to use the abilities that he suddenly learned in the manga with 0 explanation\n* Team 7 actually going on missions and getting development together\n* Countless other smaller details that the anime adds to make the story feel more complete\n\nAlso the fact that you claimed they were taking \"another artists work\" when the writer of the Boruto manga not only played a giant role in the first arc of the anime but also personally wrote that and another anime-only arc into a novelization. He's literally credited as a script supervisor for the Boruto anime *to this day*, even though he's not on the manga's team anymore.",

It's easily understandable just how garbage this fight is. Sakura vs Shin ? The fight that it took 5 minutes for prince in the white horse to arrive and save her ass ? Kawaki vs Deepa/Boruto vs Ao are standard shonen anime fights you could find in literally every single show. Boruto vs Nue ? Pfft, Okay in that case Mecha Naruto vs Naruto is a good fight too. Jigen vs Naruto/Sasuke can't br even considered a fight, they nerfed Naruto and Sasuke both to the ground. The single and only fight i and a lot of other old fans agree to be at least decent is Momo vs Naruto/Sasuke.\n\nThe rest of the fights either completely ignore or ruin the power scale, or is just your average shounen anime fight. Fyi my example of a good fight is Kakashi vs Zabuza, the fight which introduced us to so many things and explained a lot of stuff, had good animation for it's time and pushed the team 7 as characters lots",

It wasn't even a fight, they simply used a year worth of budget in Kawaki's introduction. Kakuja Kaneki's first appearance was kinda badass, does it make he's fight vs the instructor guy good ? No fuxk no \n\nCan't handle the truth can't ya ? Just like how i consider all these fight bad you also think of all Boruto's fight as awesome, so please shut your mouth,  if I'm biased you are also too.\n\nIronic how you think Naruto's fandom is the most toxic when Boruto's sub exists, People absolutely downvote anything that doesn't praise the superiority of Boruto.

Sadge bruh\n\nI Don't care about anime, in the manga he hasn't done shit without he's karma. Karma is easily the single must bs power i have ever seen in the Naruto universe, how did Boruto get it ? He used the rasengan Naruto gave him, for some random reason Momo could without any touching mark Karma on boruto Boruto, without any explanation Karma has the op abilities like absorbing chakra, teleport, increasing the users physical ability, whatever Karma is compatible with your body or not is also based on your luck, we never got an explanation on why Kawaki and Boruto could become a vessel but somehow Code received another asspull named White karma. \n\nKurama presence made Narutos chakra unstable, meaning if he wasn't there Naruto would've an easier time channelling he's own chakra and cast jutsu. Kurama alone was like  50% of he's power, he has the sage mode, he's an uzumaki which means a lot chakra and life force, he's also a prodigy since he was the person to complete the rasengan, a feat which he's father genius father couldn't.\n\nAh yes my favorite excuse of all-time, hE's A gEniUs sO hE dOesN't nEEd to tRAiN. mInAto gEnEs sKipPeD a gEneRatIon, nAruTo sTuPid bOritto pRodiGy, he accidentally made the vanishing rasengan xD...

So you ignore the anime which fleshed out the characters the world and the lore and focus on the manga which is pretty much a skeleton for the anime the manga is monthly with only 60 chapters how do you expect it to go as in detail as the anime? And karma has to be compatible with the user that\u2019s why Isshiki went through the trouble of looking for Kawaki and Momoshiki literally said Boruto was a perfect vessel and heavily inherited the otsutsuki genes and I never said anything about Boruto being a prodigy because of naruto I said if he wasn\u2019t a prodigy people would\u2019ve been mad and your trying to equate real life biology to a fictional world kakashi literally says that Boruto inherited Minatos Genius and narutos unpredictability so that\u2019s not necessarily true and we know that if you have a powerful parent your most likely to have a higher potential then when compared to a person that comes from a weaker parent",

Ao vs Boruto we saw Boruto struggle first hand with seeing how being a ninja has effected a veteran shinobi during this time we also see Boruto\u2019s struggle with mugino\u2019s death how it made him more resolved etc Kawaki vs Garou was 1 an introduction to Kawaki but also an introduction to Karma and how lethal it can really be this is also around the time Boruto first activates karma team 7 vs Deepa another example of a good fight not only was it decently choreographed but Deepas character was interesting hes what everyone wanted urashiki to be that battle not only introduced us to Kara but it also effected team 7 they realized that they where weak while being considered prodigies in the face of power all of it was meaningless that battle pushed them to train harder then they every did specially Boruto after that loss he trained day and night for some Days so he could find a way to defeat deepa it all made them more resolved after that battle Boruto began analyzing the situation more and pushed him to want to actually get stronger all the fights I sent you where well choreographed gave us more information developed the characters and where entertaining",

I think Boruto as a show has already suffered that fate given it\u2019s reputation among Naruto fans. Doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t still be an enjoyable story, but if you lose your target audience in the beginning, something\u2019s gone wrong.\n\nEdit: wording to be more objective (although people\u2019s enjoyment of any show are entirely subjective!)",

There is nothing stated about him starving to death, and in any story it's generally assumed that the world functions like reality unless explicitly stated otherwise. Yes, it's *possible* they let his head do things severed heads can't do despite his abilities not being made for that, but aside from him not dying from stuff he is *specifically* built to not die from, there is not much to support the idea. So unless he comes back in Boruto and says he could do that himself, he's dead. Using something that is only *technically* possible because it doesn't contradict what already been said is usually only done for personal headcanons. If that how you want to see it, then fine, no problem. As far as canon is concerned though, he's dead.",

It doesn't matter if it was filler or not. One of narutos strong points in the first place was how well the fillers were, because if you were anime only you wouldn't be able to tell the difference at times (besides the funny gag fillers).

The only two arc of filler that I really hate in boruto are those about Cho Cho and the movie star and the one where Mitsuki ran away from the village.\nStill the best filler- and maybe the only one that is really good- is Kakashi Anbu Arc.

Didn't like the first half with kabuto, but the final scenes were amazing. \n\nBorutos filler was dog shit. I didn't really like any of the filler in boruto, which so happens to take up the whole series. The problem with borutos filler is that the filler could be a series all on its own, and it IS a series on its own since, again, there's only like 1 canon arc in boruto, and when I stopped watching boruto there was 0 cannon arcs (150 episodes of straight filler) so it really is just a filler series that isn't canon to a good story. \n\nYou can judge boruto off its filler since the whole show is filler. Almost every episode is pure filler, nothing more. By your logic of not judging boruto off its filler, you'd either have to skip literally over 150 episodes in a row, and go straight to the first canon arc which is like ep 160 or something (idk i don't keep up with shit) or just not judge boruto at all. \n\nIm gonna judge it off its filler, since by the time I stopped watching, it was only filler, meaning it was a legit series but none of it was canon to Naruto so it was its own separate anime universe (thats how anime works. Not every anime series is connected to eachother. They are there own universes) \n\nBoruto is shit, you can't change my mind on that because its just fax, just as much fax as humans will never fully understand the universe since its literally imposible",

I am not here to change your mind, I understand it\u2019s frustrating to watch 150 episodes of filler, but you logic doesn\u2019t make sense to me because Naruto Shippuden and OG Naruto are 55% and 41% filler, consecutively. So I\u2019d have to considerer these two amazing shows as s*it too because of their long fillers, what is not the case. And yes, a lot of people jump hundreds of Naruto episode to not watch the filler, so ig it\u2019s pretty legit to do so in boruto if you want to. \nAgain, it\u2019s mainly the studio fault for not waiting the manga to create more content to the anime, but I just don\u2019t consider boruto s*it cause I read the manga and watched the canon content they have still now and I can say sincerely that it\u2019s one of the best content they have in the Naruto franchise as a whole. \nBut again I understand and respect your opinion, but I just advise you to watch now at least some of the new canon content, which is pretty good.",

Also, the anime said that shikadai became a chunin and set up this whole system of where chunin jonin and genin get there missions on separate levels, then immediately contracticted that in the episode which was shit. \n\nThe difference between skipping Naruto filler and boruto filler is that Naruto filler is normally less then 15 episodes at a time for each filler arc, so your only skipping like 15, at most 20 episodes, at a time which is reasonable for any anime, but in borutos case your skipping 160 episodes all at once, which is just ridiculous. At that point your better off just making a new series. I don't plan on going back to boruto any time soon because I'm still tramitized by the character designs and the utter shit that it was (aswell as the voice acting because im a dub watcher and did eventually skip to sub after ep 54 but I didn't like either) as well as the story. \n\nAnd borutos bitchyness. He needs to grow the fuck up.",

Also, the anime said that shikadai became a chunin and set up this whole system of where chunin jonin and genin get there missions on separate levels, then immediately contracticted that in the episode which was shit. \n\nThe difference between skipping Naruto filler and boruto filler is that Naruto filler is normally less then 15 episodes at a time for each filler arc, so your only skipping like 15, at most 20 episodes, at a time which is reasonable for any anime, but in borutos case your skipping 160 episodes all at once, which is just ridiculous. At that point your better off just making a new series. I don't plan on going back to boruto any time soon because I'm still tramitized by the character designs and the utter shit that it was (aswell as the voice acting because im a dub watcher and did eventually skip to sub after ep 54 but I didn't like either) as well as the story. \n\nAnd borutos bitchyness.

Power scalling in Naruto was similar because it did have genin defeating high level shinobi, but it was always by strategy and technique. Besides Naruto, but he used the 9 tails to defeat high level ninja that he can't beat normally. Boruto doesn't have that. I understand boruto getting the final attack on that otsosuki in the movie because that rasengan was made from Narutos Chakra, and Naruto wanted boruto to get battle experience, but every other time a genin other then Mitsuki defeats a high level oponet, I have to punch my screen.",

At Naruto's peak the character writing was second to none and that seeped into everything: world-building, story, and fights. The Pain arc is considered the peak of Naruto because the character writing is molded by the world-building, drives the story, and is expressed in the fights.\n\nI don't really see any of that in Boruto. Boruto ignores Naruto's worldbuilding and doesn't really make a dedicated effort to make its own. It just assumes that you should know things. The character writing is a shadow of Naruto's as most characters don't feel very driven and their conflicts feel shallow rather than entrenched in the world. The power-scaling feels ridiculous even by Naruto standards with 12-year-old Boruto landing saving the day and landing the finishing blow on an Otsutsuki. The most ridiculous Naruto ever got in that aspect was having 12-year-old Konohamaru take down a stationary Pain body, while it was distracted and had its guard down.",

And about that sci-fi sequel, I love that idea but it\u2019s hard to imagine it now with Boruto already there. \n\nAbout the characters\u2019 drives, you can\u2019t see it as much as you did in Naruto since they don\u2019t have tragic backstories but rather make their life moving forward tragic, I like that approach honestly because it feels fresh and new. \n\nAbout Boruto forgetting why people liked Naruto, I think Kishimoto was going for a different approach when it comes to writing Boruto, it\u2019d be boring if he did the same thing both for him and the fans. \n\nNow the last bit makes a lot of sense since a kid beating someone above kaguya level is insane, but I think that\u2019s setting up what Boruto will fight in the future, kinda like how Naruto defeated Garra which then built up fighting for tailed beasts and stuff.",

Heck, the Kishimoto manga chapters haven't even made it into the anime yet (Kishimoto's first chapter was in January 2021). The people who made Boruto were Kishimoto's assistants who were put in charge of a Naruto sequel after Kishimoto refused. But taking over a manga five years into it is kind of too late to really mold it into something you want so even with Kishimoto continuing the story it's not really his story, especially when he has to write his way to the flash-forward as well, which makes the path even more rigid.\n\nAlso, I don't mind times when Boruto outshines Naruto or Sasuke but it has to happen realistically. When Kakashi got caught by Zabuza, Naruto and Sasuke devised a way to free Kakashi rather than take on Zabuza themselves. In Boruto it seems that Boruto needs to fight the big bad himself rather than doing something to help the more powerful combatant. Also, power escalation isn't happening naturally in Boruto, if you read the manga you know. Kishimoto made things a lot worse in that aspect.",

If I\u2019m going to start a show and like episode 5 or 10 is already filler, that\u2019s just terrible and the anime shouldn\u2019t have even started yet or the directors are smoking that good shit. \n\nBoruto already has a high filler to cannon percentage but the show is nowhere near as long. It makes it way harder to even want to watch it, also the show started strong and stayed strong for a good while story wise.\n\nFirst we have the sasuke introduction, then we see how far the trio has come and we see how crazy fucking strong they are now including Sakura and the hype was off the rails for the first season. Boruto starts off cool, then immediately goes downhill into filler and into boruto who is a snot nosed brat and then we have Sarada whos just a watered down not as interesting sasuke.\nEtc etc\n\nIt\u2019s just nowhere near as hype or interesting when the characters predecessors are wayyyy more interesting than themselves. Why watch it when the previous seasons are literally more interesting? They nerf our past characters so the new ones can do interesting stuff but it just comes off as lame and hand waving, the characters are essentially the same as their parents but more cringey, the animation isn\u2019t even as good, the music isn\u2019t as good, the villains aren\u2019t as interesting. \n\nI just don\u2019t see why SHOULD you watch boruto?",

Anything that wasn't in the manga is shit.\n\nThe problem with that logic is the \"filler\" in Boruto was designed specifically to progress the series to a certain point. The writers had to come up with their own content during the beginning of the series to introduce the characters, the world, and the plot. It isn't anywhere near comparable to something like the Ostrich episode from Naruto.\n\nAre there portions where the filler *is* bad? Sure. But Naruto has had worse quality fillers and filler arcs.",

But when there\u2019s more filler than actual content and you only just started your show then yes there\u2019s a problem. \n\nYou\u2019re taking another artists work and adding fluff to it that 90% of the time doesn\u2019t actually add anything to it that the original story does have. Making a show and then immediately making filler does not help a shows story whatsoever which is absolutely crucial to the beginning of the story especially when boruto already has a slow story even in the manga itself so the filler makes the story even slower and more boring.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t allow the story to go anywhere and why should I watch a show where it takes 80 episodes to actually get anywhere; it\u2019s my same gripe I have with one piece where the story can feel absolutely stagnant and takes way too long to actually tell the story they want to tell. There hasn\u2019t been a single arc in boruto that\u2019s been as hype as say the original chunin exams or the sasuke arc yet they add seasons of filler, they expect the consumer to watch filler for a show that barely has moved in its story. To me that\u2019s basically spitting in the consumers face and just downright stupid.",

Come on man you and me both know that's a lie. There are tonnes of important stuff that is in the filler episodes that isn't in the manga. Ex:\n\n* Addition of the Jougan\n* Toneri making an appearance\n* Larger *permanent* cast of characters that aren't for one-off filler episodes\n* Sumire actually receiving a backstory\n* Sarada receving a backstory as to how she got the Sharingan\n* Sarada's family backstory\n* Info on Orochimaru and Taka's whereabouts\n* Mitsuki's Backstory\n* Mitsuki's Sage Mode\n* Boruto learning how to use the abilities that he suddenly learned in the manga with 0 explanation\n* Team 7 actually going on missions and getting development together\n* Countless other smaller details that the anime adds to make the story feel more complete\n\nAlso the fact that you claimed they were taking \"another artists work\" when the writer of the Boruto manga not only played a giant role in the first arc of the anime but also personally wrote that and another anime-only arc into a novelization. He's literally credited as a script supervisor for the Boruto anime *to this day*, even though he's not on the manga's team anymore.",

Kawaki vs Deepa/Boruto vs Ao are standard shonen anime fights you could find in literally every single show. Boruto vs Nue ? Pfft, Okay in that case Mecha Naruto vs Naruto is a good fight too. Jigen vs Naruto/Sasuke can't br even considered a fight, they nerfed Naruto and Sasuke both to the ground. The single and only fight i and a lot of other old fans agree to be at least decent is Momo vs Naruto/Sasuke.\n\nThe rest of the fights either completely ignore or ruin the power scale, or is just your average shounen anime fight. Fyi my example of a good fight is Kakashi vs Zabuza, the fight which introduced us to so many things and explained a lot of stuff, had good animation for it's time and pushed the team 7 as characters lots",

It wasn't even a fight, they simply used a year worth of budget in Kawaki's introduction. Kakuja Kaneki's first appearance was kinda badass, does it make he's fight vs the instructor guy good ? No fuxk no \n\nCan't handle the truth can't ya ? Just like how i consider all these fight bad you also think of all Boruto's fight as awesome, so please shut your mouth,  if I'm biased you are also too.\n\nIronic how you think Naruto's fandom is the most toxic when Boruto's sub exists, People absolutely downvote anything that doesn't praise the superiority of Boruto. Don't worship Boruto and you're hater worthy of death.\n\ntHe onLy peOpLe wHo sAy Naruto and Sasuke aRe cArYyInG thE sHoW aRe tHe pEoPle wHo dOesn't wAtCh tHe sHow, who's pushing he's opinions again lmao, ignoring the facts is all you do\n\nWasn't Naruto the first place in the popularity poll rofl ? Sadge bruh\n\nI Don't care about anime, in the manga he hasn't done shit without he's karma. Karma is easily the single must bs power i have ever seen in the Naruto universe, how did Boruto get it ? He used the rasengan Naruto gave him, for some random reason Momo could without any touching mark Karma on boruto Boruto, without any explanation Karma has the op abilities like absorbing chakra, teleport, increasing the users physical ability, whatever Karma is compatible with your body or not is also based on your luck, we never got an explanation on why Kawaki and Boruto could become a vessel but somehow Code received another asspull named White karma. \n\nKurama presence made Narutos chakra unstable, meaning if he wasn't there Naruto would've an easier time channelling he's own chakra and cast jutsu. Kurama alone was like  50% of he's power, he has the sage mode, he's an uzumaki which means a lot chakra and life force, he's also a prodigy since he was the person to complete the rasengan, a feat which he's father genius father couldn't.\n\nAh yes my favorite excuse of all-time, hE's A gEniUs sO hE dOesN't nEEd to tRAiN. mInAto gEnEs sKipPeD a gEneRatIon, nAruTo sTuPid bOritto pRodiGy, he accidentally made the vanishing rasengan xD...

To me the choreography, the meaning behind the fight, and what the fight sets up is what makes it important Kawaki\u2019s fight had top tier choreography it was our introduction to both Kawaki and karma and Kawaki\u2019s attitude that whole fight was straight badass and no I don\u2019t think every fight in Boruto is good nor did I say all the fights in Boruto are good I know there are some good fights just as there are bad fights you just like to donate every Single fight in Boruto as bad except the one where naruto and sasuke where actually winning a fight and while Boruto sub is toxic Naruto random as a whole is toxic go to any social media that has an anime community and I can guarantee that Naruto fandom is more toxic I\u2019m not talking about Reddit I\u2019m talking about Instagram tiktok Twitter Reddit etc everywhere you  will run into obnoxious and disrespectful naruto fans that shit on everyone\u2019s opinion that doesn\u2019t agree with theirs and the only people saying naruto and sasuke carry Boruto and Naruto fanboys that can\u2019t get passed the fact that Naruto isn\u2019t the mc literally the only time you hear people saying that is when they are hating on Boruto and no recent popularity pole Boruto was 1st not Naruto narutos was first in the first popularity pole they did. So you ignore the anime which fleshed out the characters the world and the lore and focus on the manga which is pretty much a skeleton for the anime the manga is monthly with only 60 chapters how do you expect it to go as in detail as the anime? And karma has to be compatible with the user that\u2019s why Isshiki went through the trouble of looking for Kawaki and Momoshiki literally said Boruto was a perfect vessel and heavily inherited the otsutsuki genes and I never said anything about Boruto being a prodigy because of naruto I said if he wasn\u2019t a prodigy people would\u2019ve been mad and your trying to equate real life biology to a fictional world kakashi literally says that Boruto inherited Minatos Genius and narutos unpredictability so that\u2019s not necessarily true and we know that if you have a powerful parent your most likely to have a higher potential then when compared to a person that comes from a weaker parent",

Ao vs Boruto we saw Boruto struggle first hand with seeing how being a ninja has effected a veteran shinobi during this time we also see Boruto\u2019s struggle with mugino\u2019s death how it made him more resolved etc Kawaki vs Garou was 1 an introduction to Kawaki but also an introduction to Karma and how lethal it can really be this is also around the time Boruto first activates karma team 7 vs Deepa another example of a good fight not only was it decently choreographed but Deepas character was interesting hes what everyone wanted urashiki to be that battle not only introduced us to Kara but it also effected team 7 they realized that they where weak while being considered prodigies in the face of power all of it was meaningless that battle pushed them to train harder then they every did specially Boruto after that loss he trained day and night for some Days so he could find a way to defeat deepa it all made them more resolved after that battle Boruto began analyzing the situation more and pushed him to want to actually get stronger all the fights I sent you where well choreographed gave us more information developed the characters and where entertaining",

I think Boruto as a show has already suffered that fate given it\u2019s reputation among Naruto fans. Doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t still be an enjoyable story, but if you lose your target audience in the beginning, something\u2019s gone wrong.\n\nEdit: wording to be more objective (although people\u2019s enjoyment of any show are entirely subjective!)",

There is nothing stated about him starving to death, and in any story it's generally assumed that the world functions like reality unless explicitly stated otherwise. Yes, it's *possible* they let his head do things severed heads can't do despite his abilities not being made for that, but aside from him not dying from stuff he is *specifically* built to not die from, there is not much to support the idea. So unless he comes back in Boruto and says he could do that himself, he's dead. Using something that is only *technically* possible because it doesn't contradict what already been said is usually only done for personal headcanons. If that how you want to see it, then fine, no problem. As far as canon is concerned though, he's dead.",

It doesn't matter if it was filler or not. One of narutos strong points in the first place was how well the fillers were, because if you were anime only you wouldn't be able to tell the difference at times (besides the funny gag fillers).

The only two arc of filler that I really hate in boruto are those about Cho Cho and the movie star and the one where Mitsuki ran away from the village.\nStill the best filler- and maybe the only one that is really good- is Kakashi Anbu Arc.

Didn't like the first half with kabuto, but the final scenes were amazing. \n\nBorutos filler was dog shit. I didn't really like any of the filler in boruto, which so happens to take up the whole series. The problem with borutos filler is that the filler could be a series all on its own, and it IS a series on its own since, again, there's only like 1 canon arc in boruto, and when I stopped watching boruto there was 0 cannon arcs (150 episodes of straight filler) so it really is just a filler series that isn't canon to a good story. \n\nYou can judge boruto off its filler since the whole show is filler. Almost every episode is pure filler, nothing more. By your logic of not judging boruto off its filler, you'd either have to skip literally over 150 episodes in a row, and go straight to the first canon arc which is like ep 160 or something (idk i don't keep up with shit) or just not judge boruto at all. \n\nIm gonna judge it off its filler, since by the time I stopped watching, it was only filler, meaning it was a legit series but none of it was canon to Naruto so it was its own separate anime universe (thats how anime works. Not every anime series is connected to eachother. They are there own universes) \n\nBoruto is shit, you can't change my mind on that because its just fax, just as much fax as humans will never fully understand the universe since its literally imposible",

I am not here to change your mind, I understand it\u2019s frustrating to watch 150 episodes of filler, but you logic doesn\u2019t make sense to me because Naruto Shippuden and OG Naruto are 55% and 41% filler, consecutively. So I\u2019d have to considerer these two amazing shows as s*it too because of their long fillers, what is not the case. And yes, a lot of people jump hundreds of Naruto episode to not watch the filler, so ig it\u2019s pretty legit to do so in boruto if you want to. \nAgain, it\u2019s mainly the studio fault for not waiting the manga to create more content to the anime, but I just don\u2019t consider boruto s*it cause I read the manga and watched the canon content they have still now and I can say sincerely that it\u2019s one of the best content they have in the Naruto franchise as a whole. \nBut again I understand and respect your opinion, but I just advise you to watch now at least some of the new canon content, which is pretty good.",

Also, the anime said that shikadai became a chunin and set up this whole system of where chunin jonin and genin get there missions on separate levels, then immediately contracticted that in the episode which was shit. \n\nThe difference between skipping Naruto filler and boruto filler is that Naruto filler is normally less then 15 episodes at a time for each filler arc, so your only skipping like 15, at most 20 episodes, at a time which is reasonable for any anime, but in borutos case your skipping 160 episodes all at once, which is just ridiculous. At that point your better off just making a new series. I don't plan on going back to boruto any time soon because I'm still tramitized by the character designs and the utter shit that it was (aswell as the voice acting because im a dub watcher and did eventually skip to sub after ep 54 but I didn't like either) as well as the story. \n\nAnd borutos bitchyness.

Also, the anime said that shikadai became a chunin and set up this whole system of where chunin jonin and genin get there missions on separate levels, then immediately contracticted that in the episode which was shit. \n\nThe difference between skipping Naruto filler and boruto filler is that Naruto filler is normally less then 15 episodes at a time for each filler arc, so your only skipping like 15, at most 20 episodes, at a time which is reasonable for any anime, but in borutos case your skipping 160 episodes all at once, which is just ridiculous. At that point your better off just making a new series. I don't plan on going back to boruto any time soon because I'm still tramitized by the character designs and the utter shit that it was (aswell as the voice acting because im a dub watcher and did eventually skip to sub after ep 54 but I didn't like either) as well as the story. \n\nAnd borutos bitchyness.

Almost every episode is pure filler, nothing more. By your logic of not judging boruto off its filler, you'd either have to skip literally over 150 episodes in a row, and go straight to the first canon arc which is like ep 160 or something (idk i don't keep up with shit) or just not judge boruto at all. \n\nIm gonna judge it off its filler, since by the time I stopped watching, it was only filler, meaning it was a legit series but none of it was canon to Naruto so it was its own separate anime universe (thats how anime works. Not every anime series is connected to eachother.

Power scalling in Naruto was similar because it did have genin defeating high level shinobi, but it was always by strategy and technique. Besides Naruto, but he used the 9 tails to defeat high level ninja that he can't beat normally. Boruto doesn't have that. I understand boruto getting the final attack on that otsosuki in the movie because that rasengan was made from Narutos Chakra, and Naruto wanted boruto to get battle experience, but every other time a genin other then Mitsuki defeats a high level oponet, I have to punch my screen.",

At Naruto's peak the character writing was second to none and that seeped into everything: world-building, story, and fights. The Pain arc is considered the peak of Naruto because the character writing is molded by the world-building, drives the story, and is expressed in the fights.\n\nI don't really see any of that in Boruto. Boruto ignores Naruto's worldbuilding and doesn't really make a dedicated effort to make its own. It just assumes that you should know things. The character writing is a shadow of Naruto's as most characters don't feel very driven and their conflicts feel shallow rather than entrenched in the world. The power-scaling feels ridiculous even by Naruto standards with 12-year-old Boruto landing saving the day and landing the finishing blow on an Otsutsuki. The most ridiculous Naruto ever got in that aspect was having 12-year-old Konohamaru take down a stationary Pain body, while it was distracted and had its guard down.",

And about that sci-fi sequel, I love that idea but it\u2019s hard to imagine it now with Boruto already there. \n\nAbout the characters\u2019 drives, you can\u2019t see it as much as you did in Naruto since they don\u2019t have tragic backstories but rather make their life moving forward tragic, I like that approach honestly because it feels fresh and new. \n\nAbout Boruto forgetting why people liked Naruto, I think Kishimoto was going for a different approach when it comes to writing Boruto, it\u2019d be boring if he did the same thing both for him and the fans. \n\nNow the last bit makes a lot of sense since a kid beating someone above kaguya level is insane, but I think that\u2019s setting up what Boruto will fight in the future, kinda like how Naruto defeated Garra which then built up fighting for tailed beasts and stuff.",

Heck, the Kishimoto manga chapters haven't even made it into the anime yet (Kishimoto's first chapter was in January 2021). The people who made Boruto were Kishimoto's assistants who were put in charge of a Naruto sequel after Kishimoto refused. But taking over a manga five years into it is kind of too late to really mold it into something you want so even with Kishimoto continuing the story it's not really his story, especially when he has to write his way to the flash-forward as well, which makes the path even more rigid.\n\nAlso, I don't mind times when Boruto outshines Naruto or Sasuke but it has to happen realistically. When Kakashi got caught by Zabuza, Naruto and Sasuke devised a way to free Kakashi rather than take on Zabuza themselves. In Boruto it seems that Boruto needs to fight the big bad himself rather than doing something to help the more powerful combatant. Also, power escalation isn't happening naturally in Boruto, if you read the manga you know. Kishimoto made things a lot worse in that aspect.",

If I\u2019m going to start a show and like episode 5 or 10 is already filler, that\u2019s just terrible and the anime shouldn\u2019t have even started yet or the directors are smoking that good shit. \n\nBoruto already has a high filler to cannon percentage but the show is nowhere near as long. It makes it way harder to even want to watch it, also the show started strong and stayed strong for a good while story wise.\n\nFirst we have the sasuke introduction, then we see how far the trio has come and we see how crazy fucking strong they are now including Sakura and the hype was off the rails for the first season. Boruto starts off cool, then immediately goes downhill into filler and into boruto who is a snot nosed brat and then we have Sarada whos just a watered down not as interesting sasuke.\nEtc etc\n\nIt\u2019s just nowhere near as hype or interesting when the characters predecessors are wayyyy more interesting than themselves. Why watch it when the previous seasons are literally more interesting? They nerf our past characters so the new ones can do interesting stuff but it just comes off as lame and hand waving, the characters are essentially the same as their parents but more cringey, the animation isn\u2019t even as good, the music isn\u2019t as good, the villains aren\u2019t as interesting. \n\nI just don\u2019t see why SHOULD you watch boruto?",

Anything that wasn't in the manga is shit.\n\nThe problem with that logic is the \"filler\" in Boruto was designed specifically to progress the series to a certain point. The writers had to come up with their own content during the beginning of the series to introduce the characters, the world, and the plot. It isn't anywhere near comparable to something like the Ostrich episode from Naruto.\n\nAre there portions where the filler *is* bad? Sure. But Naruto has had worse quality fillers and filler arcs.",

But when there\u2019s more filler than actual content and you only just started your show then yes there\u2019s a problem. \n\nYou\u2019re taking another artists work and adding fluff to it that 90% of the time doesn\u2019t actually add anything to it that the original story does have. Making a show and then immediately making filler does not help a shows story whatsoever which is absolutely crucial to the beginning of the story especially when boruto already has a slow story even in the manga itself so the filler makes the story even slower and more boring.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t allow the story to go anywhere and why should I watch a show where it takes 80 episodes to actually get anywhere; it\u2019s my same gripe I have with one piece where the story can feel absolutely stagnant and takes way too long to actually tell the story they want to tell. There hasn\u2019t been a single arc in boruto that\u2019s been as hype as say the original chunin exams or the sasuke arc yet they add seasons of filler, they expect the consumer to watch filler for a show that barely has moved in its story. To me that\u2019s basically spitting in the consumers face and just downright stupid.",

Come on man you and me both know that's a lie. There are tonnes of important stuff that is in the filler episodes that isn't in the manga. Ex:\n\n* Addition of the Jougan\n* Toneri making an appearance\n* Larger *permanent* cast of characters that aren't for one-off filler episodes\n* Sumire actually receiving a backstory\n* Sarada receving a backstory as to how she got the Sharingan\n* Sarada's family backstory\n* Info on Orochimaru and Taka's whereabouts\n* Mitsuki's Backstory\n* Mitsuki's Sage Mode\n* Boruto learning how to use the abilities that he suddenly learned in the manga with 0 explanation\n* Team 7 actually going on missions and getting development together\n* Countless other smaller details that the anime adds to make the story feel more complete\n\nAlso the fact that you claimed they were taking \"another artists work\" when the writer of the Boruto manga not only played a giant role in the first arc of the anime but also personally wrote that and another anime-only arc into a novelization. He's literally credited as a script supervisor for the Boruto anime *to this day*, even though he's not on the manga's team anymore.",

Jigen vs Naruto/Sasuke can't br even considered a fight, they nerfed Naruto and Sasuke both to the ground. The single and only fight i and a lot of other old fans agree to be at least decent is Momo vs Naruto/Sasuke.\n\nThe rest of the fights either completely ignore or ruin the power scale, or is just your average shounen anime fight.

It wasn't even a fight, they simply used a year worth of budget in Kawaki's introduction. Kakuja Kaneki's first appearance was kinda badass, does it make he's fight vs the instructor guy good ? No fuxk no \n\nCan't handle the truth can't ya ? Just like how i consider all these fight bad you also think of all Boruto's fight as awesome, so please shut your mouth,  if I'm biased you are also too.\n\nIronic how you think Naruto's fandom is the most toxic when Boruto's sub exists, People absolutely downvote anything that doesn't praise the superiority of Boruto. Don't worship Boruto and you're hater worthy of death.\n\ntHe onLy peOpLe wHo sAy Naruto and Sasuke aRe cArYyInG thE sHoW aRe tHe pEoPle wHo dOesn't wAtCh tHe sHow, who's pushing he's opinions again lmao, ignoring the facts is all you do\n\nWasn't Naruto the first place in the popularity poll rofl ? Sadge bruh\n\nI Don't care about anime, in the manga he hasn't done shit without he's karma. Karma is easily the single must bs power i have ever seen in the Naruto universe, how did Boruto get it ? He used the rasengan Naruto gave him, for some random reason Momo could without any touching mark Karma on boruto Boruto, without any explanation Karma has the op abilities like absorbing chakra, teleport, increasing the users physical ability, whatever Karma is compatible with your body or not is also based on your luck, we never got an explanation on why Kawaki and Boruto could become a vessel but somehow Code received another asspull named White karma. \n\nKurama presence made Narutos chakra unstable, meaning if he wasn't there Naruto would've an easier time channelling he's own chakra and cast jutsu. Kurama alone was like  50% of he's power, he has the sage mode, he's an uzumaki which means a lot chakra and life force, he's also a prodigy since he was the person to complete the rasengan, a feat which he's father genius father couldn't.\n\nAh yes my favorite excuse of all-time, hE's A gEniUs sO hE dOesN't nEEd to tRAiN. mInAto gEnEs sKipPeD a gEneRatIon, nAruTo sTuPid bOritto pRodiGy, he accidentally made the vanishing rasengan xD... So fuxking much for a genius\n\nAsuma was the child third hokage Hiruzen, a genius parent doesn't automatically make their kid a genius too, thats not how biology works",

To me the choreography, the meaning behind the fight, and what the fight sets up is what makes it important Kawaki\u2019s fight had top tier choreography it was our introduction to both Kawaki and karma and Kawaki\u2019s attitude that whole fight was straight badass and no I don\u2019t think every fight in Boruto is good nor did I say all the fights in Boruto are good I know there are some good fights just as there are bad fights you just like to donate every Single fight in Boruto as bad except the one where naruto and sasuke where actually winning a fight and while Boruto sub is toxic Naruto random as a whole is toxic go to any social media that has an anime community and I can guarantee that Naruto fandom is more toxic I\u2019m not talking about Reddit I\u2019m talking about Instagram tiktok Twitter Reddit etc everywhere you  will run into obnoxious and disrespectful naruto fans that shit on everyone\u2019s opinion that doesn\u2019t agree with theirs and the only people saying naruto and sasuke carry Boruto and Naruto fanboys that can\u2019t get passed the fact that Naruto isn\u2019t the mc literally the only time you hear people saying that is when they are hating on Boruto and no recent popularity pole Boruto was 1st not Naruto narutos was first in the first popularity pole they did. So you ignore the anime which fleshed out the characters the world and the lore and focus on the manga which is pretty much a skeleton for the anime the manga is monthly with only 60 chapters how do you expect it to go as in detail as the anime? And karma has to be compatible with the user that\u2019s why Isshiki went through the trouble of looking for Kawaki and Momoshiki literally said Boruto was a perfect vessel and heavily inherited the otsutsuki genes and I never said anything about Boruto being a prodigy because of naruto I said if he wasn\u2019t a prodigy people would\u2019ve been mad and your trying to equate real life biology to a fictional world kakashi literally says that Boruto inherited Minatos Genius and narutos unpredictability so that\u2019s not necessarily true and we know that if you have a powerful parent your most likely to have a higher potential then when compared to a person that comes from a weaker parent",

Ao vs Boruto we saw Boruto struggle first hand with seeing how being a ninja has effected a veteran shinobi during this time we also see Boruto\u2019s struggle with mugino\u2019s death how it made him more resolved etc Kawaki vs Garou was 1 an introduction to Kawaki but also an introduction to Karma and how lethal it can really be this is also around the time Boruto first activates karma team 7 vs Deepa another example of a good fight not only was it decently choreographed but Deepas character was interesting hes what everyone wanted urashiki to be that battle not only introduced us to Kara but it also effected team 7 they realized that they where weak while being considered prodigies in the face of power all of it was meaningless that battle pushed them to train harder then they every did specially Boruto after that loss he trained day and night for some Days so he could find a way to defeat deepa it all made them more resolved after that battle Boruto began analyzing the situation more and pushed him to want to actually get stronger all the fights I sent you where well choreographed gave us more information developed the characters and where entertaining",

I think Boruto as a show has already suffered that fate given it\u2019s reputation among Naruto fans. Doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t still be an enjoyable story, but if you lose your target audience in the beginning, something\u2019s gone wrong.\n\nEdit: wording to be more objective (although people\u2019s enjoyment of any show are entirely subjective!)",

There is nothing stated about him starving to death, and in any story it's generally assumed that the world functions like reality unless explicitly stated otherwise. Yes, it's *possible* they let his head do things severed heads can't do despite his abilities not being made for that, but aside from him not dying from stuff he is *specifically* built to not die from, there is not much to support the idea. So unless he comes back in Boruto and says he could do that himself, he's dead. Using something that is only *technically* possible because it doesn't contradict what already been said is usually only done for personal headcanons. If that how you want to see it, then fine, no problem. As far as canon is concerned though, he's dead.",

In shippuden and OG you had amazing fights and suddenly they jumped to some crazy filler about kid Naruto trying to capture some ostrich ???\nAnd even that filler is half of Shippuden I would never call shippuden a bad show. \nAlso, in my personal opinion I like boruto\u2019s filler slightly more because as most of the show is still filler they had to make them a little bit better. The only two arc of filler that I really hate in boruto are those about Cho Cho and the movie star and the one where Mitsuki ran away from the village.\nStill the best filler- and maybe the only one that is really good- is Kakashi Anbu Arc. This one totally looked not as a filler and was really enjoyable to watch",

Didn't like the first half with kabuto, but the final scenes were amazing. \n\nBorutos filler was dog shit. I didn't really like any of the filler in boruto, which so happens to take up the whole series. The problem with borutos filler is that the filler could be a series all on its own, and it IS a series on its own since, again, there's only like 1 canon arc in boruto, and when I stopped watching boruto there was 0 cannon arcs (150 episodes of straight filler) so it really is just a filler series that isn't canon to a good story. \n\nYou can judge boruto off its filler since the whole show is filler. Almost every episode is pure filler, nothing more. By your logic of not judging boruto off its filler, you'd either have to skip literally over 150 episodes in a row, and go straight to the first canon arc which is like ep 160 or something (idk i don't keep up with shit) or just not judge boruto at all. \n\nIm gonna judge it off its filler, since by the time I stopped watching, it was only filler, meaning it was a legit series but none of it was canon to Naruto so it was its own separate anime universe (thats how anime works. Not every anime series is connected to eachother. They are there own universes) \n\nBoruto is shit, you can't change my mind on that because its just fax, just as much fax as humans will never fully understand the universe since its literally imposible",

I am not here to change your mind, I understand it\u2019s frustrating to watch 150 episodes of filler, but you logic doesn\u2019t make sense to me because Naruto Shippuden and OG Naruto are 55% and 41% filler, consecutively. So I\u2019d have to considerer these two amazing shows as s*it too because of their long fillers, what is not the case. And yes, a lot of people jump hundreds of Naruto episode to not watch the filler, so ig it\u2019s pretty legit to do so in boruto if you want to. \nAgain, it\u2019s mainly the studio fault for not waiting the manga to create more content to the anime, but I just don\u2019t consider boruto s*it cause I read the manga and watched the canon content they have still now and I can say sincerely that it\u2019s one of the best content they have in the Naruto franchise as a whole. \nBut again I understand and respect your opinion, but I just advise you to watch now at least some of the new canon content, which is pretty good.",

Also, the anime said that shikadai became a chunin and set up this whole system of where chunin jonin and genin get there missions on separate levels, then immediately contracticted that in the episode which was shit. \n\nThe difference between skipping Naruto filler and boruto filler is that Naruto filler is normally less then 15 episodes at a time for each filler arc, so your only skipping like 15, at most 20 episodes, at a time which is reasonable for any anime, but in borutos case your skipping 160 episodes all at once, which is just ridiculous. At that point your better off just making a new series. I don't plan on going back to boruto any time soon because I'm still tramitized by the character designs and the utter shit that it was (aswell as the voice acting because im a dub watcher and did eventually skip to sub after ep 54 but I didn't like either) as well as the story. \n\nAnd borutos bitchyness. He needs to grow the fuck up.",

Also, the anime said that shikadai became a chunin and set up this whole system of where chunin jonin and genin get there missions on separate levels, then immediately contracticted that in the episode which was shit. \n\nThe difference between skipping Naruto filler and boruto filler is that Naruto filler is normally less then 15 episodes at a time for each filler arc, so your only skipping like 15, at most 20 episodes, at a time which is reasonable for any anime, but in borutos case your skipping 160 episodes all at once, which is just ridiculous. At that point your better off just making a new series. I don't plan on going back to boruto any time soon because I'm still tramitized by the character designs and the utter shit that it was (aswell as the voice acting because im a dub watcher and did eventually skip to sub after ep 54 but I didn't like either) as well as the story. \n\nAnd borutos bitchyness. He needs to grow the fuck up.",

Power scalling in Naruto was similar because it did have genin defeating high level shinobi, but it was always by strategy and technique. Besides Naruto, but he used the 9 tails to defeat high level ninja that he can't beat normally. Boruto doesn't have that. I understand boruto getting the final attack on that otsosuki in the movie because that rasengan was made from Narutos Chakra, and Naruto wanted boruto to get battle experience, but every other time a genin other then Mitsuki defeats a high level oponet, I have to punch my screen.",

At Naruto's peak the character writing was second to none and that seeped into everything: world-building, story, and fights. The Pain arc is considered the peak of Naruto because the character writing is molded by the world-building, drives the story, and is expressed in the fights.\n\nI don't really see any of that in Boruto. Boruto ignores Naruto's worldbuilding and doesn't really make a dedicated effort to make its own. It just assumes that you should know things. The character writing is a shadow of Naruto's as most characters don't feel very driven and their conflicts feel shallow rather than entrenched in the world. The power-scaling feels ridiculous even by Naruto standards with 12-year-old Boruto landing saving the day and landing the finishing blow on an Otsutsuki. The most ridiculous Naruto ever got in that aspect was having 12-year-old Konohamaru take down a stationary Pain body, while it was distracted and had its guard down.",

And about that sci-fi sequel, I love that idea but it\u2019s hard to imagine it now with Boruto already there. \n\nAbout the characters\u2019 drives, you can\u2019t see it as much as you did in Naruto since they don\u2019t have tragic backstories but rather make their life moving forward tragic, I like that approach honestly because it feels fresh and new. \n\nAbout Boruto forgetting why people liked Naruto, I think Kishimoto was going for a different approach when it comes to writing Boruto, it\u2019d be boring if he did the same thing both for him and the fans. \n\nNow the last bit makes a lot of sense since a kid beating someone above kaguya level is insane, but I think that\u2019s setting up what Boruto will fight in the future, kinda like how Naruto defeated Garra which then built up fighting for tailed beasts and stuff.",

Heck, the Kishimoto manga chapters haven't even made it into the anime yet (Kishimoto's first chapter was in January 2021). The people who made Boruto were Kishimoto's assistants who were put in charge of a Naruto sequel after Kishimoto refused. But taking over a manga five years into it is kind of too late to really mold it into something you want so even with Kishimoto continuing the story it's not really his story, especially when he has to write his way to the flash-forward as well, which makes the path even more rigid.\n\nAlso, I don't mind times when Boruto outshines Naruto or Sasuke but it has to happen realistically. When Kakashi got caught by Zabuza, Naruto and Sasuke devised a way to free Kakashi rather than take on Zabuza themselves. In Boruto it seems that Boruto needs to fight the big bad himself rather than doing something to help the more powerful combatant. Also, power escalation isn't happening naturally in Boruto, if you read the manga you know. Kishimoto made things a lot worse in that aspect.",

Making a show and then immediately making filler does not help a shows story whatsoever which is absolutely crucial to the beginning of the story especially when boruto already has a slow story even in the manga itself so the filler makes the story even slower and more boring.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t allow the story to go anywhere and why should I watch a show where it takes 80 episodes to actually get anywhere; it\u2019s my same gripe I have with one piece where the story can feel absolutely stagnant and takes way too long to actually tell the story they want to tell. There hasn\u2019t been a single arc in boruto that\u2019s been as hype as say the original chunin exams or the sasuke arc yet they add seasons of filler, they expect the consumer to watch filler for a show that barely has moved in its story. To me that\u2019s basically spitting in the consumers face and just downright stupid.",

Come on man you and me both know that's a lie. There are tonnes of important stuff that is in the filler episodes that isn't in the manga. Ex:\n\n* Addition of the Jougan\n* Toneri making an appearance\n* Larger *permanent* cast of characters that aren't for one-off filler episodes\n* Sumire actually receiving a backstory\n* Sarada receving a backstory as to how she got the Sharingan\n* Sarada's family backstory\n* Info on Orochimaru and Taka's whereabouts\n* Mitsuki's Backstory\n* Mitsuki's Sage Mode\n* Boruto learning how to use the abilities that he suddenly learned in the manga with 0 explanation\n* Team 7 actually going on missions and getting development together\n* Countless other smaller details that the anime adds to make the story feel more complete\n\nAlso the fact that you claimed they were taking \"another artists work\" when the writer of the Boruto manga not only played a giant role in the first arc of the anime but also personally wrote that and another anime-only arc into a novelization. He's literally credited as a script supervisor for the Boruto anime *to this day*, even though he's not on the manga's team anymore.",

Kawaki vs Deepa/Boruto vs Ao are standard shonen anime fights you could find in literally every single show. Boruto vs Nue ? Pfft, Okay in that case Mecha Naruto vs Naruto is a good fight too. Jigen vs Naruto/Sasuke can't br even considered a fight, they nerfed Naruto and Sasuke both to the ground. The single and only fight i and a lot of other old fans agree to be at least decent is Momo vs Naruto/Sasuke.\n\nThe rest of the fights either completely ignore or ruin the power scale, or is just your average shounen anime fight. Fyi my example of a good fight is Kakashi vs Zabuza, the fight which introduced us to so many things and explained a lot of stuff, had good animation for it's time and pushed the team 7 as characters lots",

He used the rasengan Naruto gave him, for some random reason Momo could without any touching mark Karma on boruto Boruto, without any explanation Karma has the op abilities like absorbing chakra, teleport, increasing the users physical ability, whatever Karma is compatible with your body or not is also based on your luck, we never got an explanation on why Kawaki and Boruto could become a vessel but somehow Code received another asspull named White karma. \n\nKurama presence made Narutos chakra unstable, meaning if he wasn't there Naruto would've an easier time channelling he's own chakra and cast jutsu. Kurama alone was like  50% of he's power, he has the sage mode, he's an uzumaki which means a lot chakra and life force, he's also a prodigy since he was the person to complete the rasengan, a feat which he's father genius father couldn't.\n\nAh yes my favorite excuse of all-time, hE's A gEniUs sO hE dOesN't nEEd to tRAiN. mInAto gEnEs sKipPeD a gEneRatIon, nAruTo sTuPid bOritto pRodiGy, he accidentally made the vanishing rasengan xD...

So you ignore the anime which fleshed out the characters the world and the lore and focus on the manga which is pretty much a skeleton for the anime the manga is monthly with only 60 chapters how do you expect it to go as in detail as the anime? And karma has to be compatible with the user that\u2019s why Isshiki went through the trouble of looking for Kawaki and Momoshiki literally said Boruto was a perfect vessel and heavily inherited the otsutsuki genes and I never said anything about Boruto being a prodigy because of naruto I said if he wasn\u2019t a prodigy people would\u2019ve been mad and your trying to equate real life biology to a fictional world kakashi literally says that Boruto inherited Minatos Genius and narutos unpredictability so that\u2019s not necessarily true and we know that if you have a powerful parent your most likely to have a higher potential then when compared to a person that comes from a weaker parent",

Ao vs Boruto we saw Boruto struggle first hand with seeing how being a ninja has effected a veteran shinobi during this time we also see Boruto\u2019s struggle with mugino\u2019s death how it made him more resolved etc Kawaki vs Garou was 1 an introduction to Kawaki but also an introduction to Karma and how lethal it can really be this is also around the time Boruto first activates karma team 7 vs Deepa another example of a good fight not only was it decently choreographed but Deepas character was interesting hes what everyone wanted urashiki to be that battle not only introduced us to Kara but it also effected team 7 they realized that they where weak while being considered prodigies in the face of power all of it was meaningless that battle pushed them to train harder then they every did specially Boruto after that loss he trained day and night for some Days so he could find a way to defeat deepa it all made them more resolved after that battle Boruto began analyzing the situation more and pushed him to want to actually get stronger all the fights I sent you where well choreographed gave us more information developed the characters and where entertaining",

So unless he comes back in Boruto and says he could do that himself, he's dead.

The only two arc of filler that I really hate in boruto are those about Cho Cho and the movie star and the one where Mitsuki ran away from the village.\nStill the best filler- and maybe the only one that is really good- is Kakashi Anbu Arc.

Didn't like the first half with kabuto, but the final scenes were amazing. \n\nBorutos filler was dog shit. I didn't really like any of the filler in boruto, which so happens to take up the whole series. The problem with borutos filler is that the filler could be a series all on its own, and it IS a series on its own since, again, there's only like 1 canon arc in boruto, and when I stopped watching boruto there was 0 cannon arcs (150 episodes of straight filler) so it really is just a filler series that isn't canon to a good story. \n\nYou can judge boruto off its filler since the whole show is filler. Almost every episode is pure filler, nothing more. By your logic of not judging boruto off its filler, you'd either have to skip literally over 150 episodes in a row, and go straight to the first canon arc which is like ep 160 or something (idk i don't keep up with shit) or just not judge boruto at all. \n\nIm gonna judge it off its filler, since by the time I stopped watching, it was only filler, meaning it was a legit series but none of it was canon to Naruto so it was its own separate anime universe (thats how anime works. Not every anime series is connected to eachother. They are there own universes) \n\nBoruto is shit, you can't change my mind on that because its just fax, just as much fax as humans will never fully understand the universe since its literally imposible",

I am not here to change your mind, I understand it\u2019s frustrating to watch 150 episodes of filler, but you logic doesn\u2019t make sense to me because Naruto Shippuden and OG Naruto are 55% and 41% filler, consecutively. So I\u2019d have to considerer these two amazing shows as s*it too because of their long fillers, what is not the case. And yes, a lot of people jump hundreds of Naruto episode to not watch the filler, so ig it\u2019s pretty legit to do so in boruto if you want to. \nAgain, it\u2019s mainly the studio fault for not waiting the manga to create more content to the anime, but I just don\u2019t consider boruto s*it cause I read the manga and watched the canon content they have still now and I can say sincerely that it\u2019s one of the best content they have in the Naruto franchise as a whole. \nBut again I understand and respect your opinion, but I just advise you to watch now at least some of the new canon content, which is pretty good.",

Also, the anime said that shikadai became a chunin and set up this whole system of where chunin jonin and genin get there missions on separate levels, then immediately contracticted that in the episode which was shit. \n\nThe difference between skipping Naruto filler and boruto filler is that Naruto filler is normally less then 15 episodes at a time for each filler arc, so your only skipping like 15, at most 20 episodes, at a time which is reasonable for any anime, but in borutos case your skipping 160 episodes all at once, which is just ridiculous. At that point your better off just making a new series. I don't plan on going back to boruto any time soon because I'm still tramitized by the character designs and the utter shit that it was (aswell as the voice acting because im a dub watcher and did eventually skip to sub after ep 54 but I didn't like either) as well as the story. \n\nAnd borutos bitchyness. He needs to grow the fuck up.",

Also, the anime said that shikadai became a chunin and set up this whole system of where chunin jonin and genin get there missions on separate levels, then immediately contracticted that in the episode which was shit. \n\nThe difference between skipping Naruto filler and boruto filler is that Naruto filler is normally less then 15 episodes at a time for each filler arc, so your only skipping like 15, at most 20 episodes, at a time which is reasonable for any anime, but in borutos case your skipping 160 episodes all at once, which is just ridiculous. At that point your better off just making a new series. I don't plan on going back to boruto any time soon because I'm still tramitized by the character designs and the utter shit that it was (aswell as the voice acting because im a dub watcher and did eventually skip to sub after ep 54 but I didn't like either) as well as the story. \n\nAnd borutos bitchyness. He needs to grow the fuck up.",

Almost every episode is pure filler, nothing more. By your logic of not judging boruto off its filler, you'd either have to skip literally over 150 episodes in a row, and go straight to the first canon arc which is like ep 160 or something (idk i don't keep up with shit) or just not judge boruto at all. \n\nIm gonna judge it off its filler, since by the time I stopped watching, it was only filler, meaning it was a legit series but none of it was canon to Naruto so it was its own separate anime universe (thats how anime works. Not every anime series is connected to eachother.

Power scalling in Naruto was similar because it did have genin defeating high level shinobi, but it was always by strategy and technique. Besides Naruto, but he used the 9 tails to defeat high level ninja that he can't beat normally. Boruto doesn't have that. I understand boruto getting the final attack on that otsosuki in the movie because that rasengan was made from Narutos Chakra, and Naruto wanted boruto to get battle experience, but every other time a genin other then Mitsuki defeats a high level oponet, I have to punch my screen.",

At Naruto's peak the character writing was second to none and that seeped into everything: world-building, story, and fights. The Pain arc is considered the peak of Naruto because the character writing is molded by the world-building, drives the story, and is expressed in the fights.\n\nI don't really see any of that in Boruto. Boruto ignores Naruto's worldbuilding and doesn't really make a dedicated effort to make its own. It just assumes that you should know things. The character writing is a shadow of Naruto's as most characters don't feel very driven and their conflicts feel shallow rather than entrenched in the world. The power-scaling feels ridiculous even by Naruto standards with 12-year-old Boruto landing saving the day and landing the finishing blow on an Otsutsuki. The most ridiculous Naruto ever got in that aspect was having 12-year-old Konohamaru take down a stationary Pain body, while it was distracted and had its guard down.",

And about that sci-fi sequel, I love that idea but it\u2019s hard to imagine it now with Boruto already there. \n\nAbout the characters\u2019 drives, you can\u2019t see it as much as you did in Naruto since they don\u2019t have tragic backstories but rather make their life moving forward tragic, I like that approach honestly because it feels fresh and new. \n\nAbout Boruto forgetting why people liked Naruto, I think Kishimoto was going for a different approach when it comes to writing Boruto, it\u2019d be boring if he did the same thing both for him and the fans. \n\nNow the last bit makes a lot of sense since a kid beating someone above kaguya level is insane, but I think that\u2019s setting up what Boruto will fight in the future, kinda like how Naruto defeated Garra which then built up fighting for tailed beasts and stuff.",

Heck, the Kishimoto manga chapters haven't even made it into the anime yet (Kishimoto's first chapter was in January 2021). The people who made Boruto were Kishimoto's assistants who were put in charge of a Naruto sequel after Kishimoto refused. But taking over a manga five years into it is kind of too late to really mold it into something you want so even with Kishimoto continuing the story it's not really his story, especially when he has to write his way to the flash-forward as well, which makes the path even more rigid.\n\nAlso, I don't mind times when Boruto outshines Naruto or Sasuke but it has to happen realistically. When Kakashi got caught by Zabuza, Naruto and Sasuke devised a way to free Kakashi rather than take on Zabuza themselves. In Boruto it seems that Boruto needs to fight the big bad himself rather than doing something to help the more powerful combatant. Also, power escalation isn't happening naturally in Boruto, if you read the manga you know. Kishimoto made things a lot worse in that aspect.",

Making a show and then immediately making filler does not help a shows story whatsoever which is absolutely crucial to the beginning of the story especially when boruto already has a slow story even in the manga itself so the filler makes the story even slower and more boring.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t allow the story to go anywhere and why should I watch a show where it takes 80 episodes to actually get anywhere; it\u2019s my same gripe I have with one piece where the story can feel absolutely stagnant and takes way too long to actually tell the story they want to tell. There hasn\u2019t been a single arc in boruto that\u2019s been as hype as say the original chunin exams or the sasuke arc yet they add seasons of filler, they expect the consumer to watch filler for a show that barely has moved in its story.

Come on man you and me both know that's a lie. There are tonnes of important stuff that is in the filler episodes that isn't in the manga. Ex:\n\n* Addition of the Jougan\n* Toneri making an appearance\n* Larger *permanent* cast of characters that aren't for one-off filler episodes\n* Sumire actually receiving a backstory\n* Sarada receving a backstory as to how she got the Sharingan\n* Sarada's family backstory\n* Info on Orochimaru and Taka's whereabouts\n* Mitsuki's Backstory\n* Mitsuki's Sage Mode\n* Boruto learning how to use the abilities that he suddenly learned in the manga with 0 explanation\n* Team 7 actually going on missions and getting development together\n* Countless other smaller details that the anime adds to make the story feel more complete\n\nAlso the fact that you claimed they were taking \"another artists work\" when the writer of the Boruto manga not only played a giant role in the first arc of the anime but also personally wrote that and another anime-only arc into a novelization. He's literally credited as a script supervisor for the Boruto anime *to this day*, even though he's not on the manga's team anymore.",

Kawaki vs Deepa/Boruto vs Ao are standard shonen anime fights you could find in literally every single show. Boruto vs Nue ? Pfft, Okay in that case Mecha Naruto vs Naruto is a good fight too. Jigen vs Naruto/Sasuke can't br even considered a fight, they nerfed Naruto and Sasuke both to the ground. The single and only fight i and a lot of other old fans agree to be at least decent is Momo vs Naruto/Sasuke.\n\nThe rest of the fights either completely ignore or ruin the power scale, or is just your average shounen anime fight. Fyi my example of a good fight is Kakashi vs Zabuza, the fight which introduced us to so many things and explained a lot of stuff, had good animation for it's time and pushed the team 7 as characters lots",

Sadge bruh\n\nI Don't care about anime, in the manga he hasn't done shit without he's karma. Karma is easily the single must bs power i have ever seen in the Naruto universe, how did Boruto get it ? He used the rasengan Naruto gave him, for some random reason Momo could without any touching mark Karma on boruto Boruto, without any explanation Karma has the op abilities like absorbing chakra, teleport, increasing the users physical ability, whatever Karma is compatible with your body or not is also based on your luck, we never got an explanation on why Kawaki and Boruto could become a vessel but somehow Code received another asspull named White karma. \n\nKurama presence made Narutos chakra unstable, meaning if he wasn't there Naruto would've an easier time channelling he's own chakra and cast jutsu. Kurama alone was like  50% of he's power, he has the sage mode, he's an uzumaki which means a lot chakra and life force, he's also a prodigy since he was the person to complete the rasengan, a feat which he's father genius father couldn't.\n\nAh yes my favorite excuse of all-time, hE's A gEniUs sO hE dOesN't nEEd to tRAiN. mInAto gEnEs sKipPeD a gEneRatIon, nAruTo sTuPid bOritto pRodiGy, he accidentally made the vanishing rasengan xD...

To me the choreography, the meaning behind the fight, and what the fight sets up is what makes it important Kawaki\u2019s fight had top tier choreography it was our introduction to both Kawaki and karma and Kawaki\u2019s attitude that whole fight was straight badass and no I don\u2019t think every fight in Boruto is good nor did I say all the fights in Boruto are good I know there are some good fights just as there are bad fights you just like to donate every Single fight in Boruto as bad except the one where naruto and sasuke where actually winning a fight and while Boruto sub is toxic Naruto random as a whole is toxic go to any social media that has an anime community and I can guarantee that Naruto fandom is more toxic I\u2019m not talking about Reddit I\u2019m talking about Instagram tiktok Twitter Reddit etc everywhere you  will run into obnoxious and disrespectful naruto fans that shit on everyone\u2019s opinion that doesn\u2019t agree with theirs and the only people saying naruto and sasuke carry Boruto and Naruto fanboys that can\u2019t get passed the fact that Naruto isn\u2019t the mc literally the only time you hear people saying that is when they are hating on Boruto and no recent popularity pole Boruto was 1st not Naruto narutos was first in the first popularity pole they did. So you ignore the anime which fleshed out the characters the world and the lore and focus on the manga which is pretty much a skeleton for the anime the manga is monthly with only 60 chapters how do you expect it to go as in detail as the anime? And karma has to be compatible with the user that\u2019s why Isshiki went through the trouble of looking for Kawaki and Momoshiki literally said Boruto was a perfect vessel and heavily inherited the otsutsuki genes and I never said anything about Boruto being a prodigy because of naruto I said if he wasn\u2019t a prodigy people would\u2019ve been mad and your trying to equate real life biology to a fictional world kakashi literally says that Boruto inherited Minatos Genius and narutos unpredictability so that\u2019s not necessarily true and we know that if you have a powerful parent your most likely to have a higher potential then when compared to a person that comes from a weaker parent",

Ao vs Boruto we saw Boruto struggle first hand with seeing how being a ninja has effected a veteran shinobi during this time we also see Boruto\u2019s struggle with mugino\u2019s death how it made him more resolved etc Kawaki vs Garou was 1 an introduction to Kawaki but also an introduction to Karma and how lethal it can really be this is also around the time Boruto first activates karma team 7 vs Deepa another example of a good fight not only was it decently choreographed but Deepas character was interesting hes what everyone wanted urashiki to be that battle not only introduced us to Kara but it also effected team 7 they realized that they where weak while being considered prodigies in the face of power all of it was meaningless that battle pushed them to train harder then they every did specially Boruto after that loss he trained day and night for some Days so he could find a way to defeat deepa it all made them more resolved after that battle Boruto began analyzing the situation more and pushed him to want to actually get stronger all the fights I sent you where well choreographed gave us more information developed the characters and where entertaining",

The only two arc of filler that I really hate in boruto are those about Cho Cho and the movie star and the one where Mitsuki ran away from the village.\nStill the best filler- and maybe the only one that is really good- is Kakashi Anbu Arc.

Didn't like the first half with kabuto, but the final scenes were amazing. \n\nBorutos filler was dog shit. I didn't really like any of the filler in boruto, which so happens to take up the whole series. The problem with borutos filler is that the filler could be a series all on its own, and it IS a series on its own since, again, there's only like 1 canon arc in boruto, and when I stopped watching boruto there was 0 cannon arcs (150 episodes of straight filler) so it really is just a filler series that isn't canon to a good story. \n\nYou can judge boruto off its filler since the whole show is filler. Almost every episode is pure filler, nothing more. By your logic of not judging boruto off its filler, you'd either have to skip literally over 150 episodes in a row, and go straight to the first canon arc which is like ep 160 or something (idk i don't keep up with shit) or just not judge boruto at all. \n\nIm gonna judge it off its filler, since by the time I stopped watching, it was only filler, meaning it was a legit series but none of it was canon to Naruto so it was its own separate anime universe (thats how anime works. Not every anime series is connected to eachother. They are there own universes) \n\nBoruto is shit, you can't change my mind on that because its just fax, just as much fax as humans will never fully understand the universe since its literally imposible",

Also, the anime said that shikadai became a chunin and set up this whole system of where chunin jonin and genin get there missions on separate levels, then immediately contracticted that in the episode which was shit. \n\nThe difference between skipping Naruto filler and boruto filler is that Naruto filler is normally less then 15 episodes at a time for each filler arc, so your only skipping like 15, at most 20 episodes, at a time which is reasonable for any anime, but in borutos case your skipping 160 episodes all at once, which is just ridiculous. At that point your better off just making a new series. I don't plan on going back to boruto any time soon because I'm still tramitized by the character designs and the utter shit that it was (aswell as the voice acting because im a dub watcher and did eventually skip to sub after ep 54 but I didn't like either) as well as the story. \n\nAnd borutos bitchyness.

Also, the anime said that shikadai became a chunin and set up this whole system of where chunin jonin and genin get there missions on separate levels, then immediately contracticted that in the episode which was shit. \n\nThe difference between skipping Naruto filler and boruto filler is that Naruto filler is normally less then 15 episodes at a time for each filler arc, so your only skipping like 15, at most 20 episodes, at a time which is reasonable for any anime, but in borutos case your skipping 160 episodes all at once, which is just ridiculous. At that point your better off just making a new series. I don't plan on going back to boruto any time soon because I'm still tramitized by the character designs and the utter shit that it was (aswell as the voice acting because im a dub watcher and did eventually skip to sub after ep 54 but I didn't like either) as well as the story. \n\nAnd borutos bitchyness.

Almost every episode is pure filler, nothing more. By your logic of not judging boruto off its filler, you'd either have to skip literally over 150 episodes in a row, and go straight to the first canon arc which is like ep 160 or something (idk i don't keep up with shit) or just not judge boruto at all. \n\nIm gonna judge it off its filler, since by the time I stopped watching, it was only filler, meaning it was a legit series but none of it was canon to Naruto so it was its own separate anime universe (thats how anime works.

At Naruto's peak the character writing was second to none and that seeped into everything: world-building, story, and fights. The Pain arc is considered the peak of Naruto because the character writing is molded by the world-building, drives the story, and is expressed in the fights.\n\nI don't really see any of that in Boruto. Boruto ignores Naruto's worldbuilding and doesn't really make a dedicated effort to make its own. It just assumes that you should know things. The character writing is a shadow of Naruto's as most characters don't feel very driven and their conflicts feel shallow rather than entrenched in the world. The power-scaling feels ridiculous even by Naruto standards with 12-year-old Boruto landing saving the day and landing the finishing blow on an Otsutsuki. The most ridiculous Naruto ever got in that aspect was having 12-year-old Konohamaru take down a stationary Pain body, while it was distracted and had its guard down.",

And about that sci-fi sequel, I love that idea but it\u2019s hard to imagine it now with Boruto already there. \n\nAbout the characters\u2019 drives, you can\u2019t see it as much as you did in Naruto since they don\u2019t have tragic backstories but rather make their life moving forward tragic, I like that approach honestly because it feels fresh and new. \n\nAbout Boruto forgetting why people liked Naruto, I think Kishimoto was going for a different approach when it comes to writing Boruto, it\u2019d be boring if he did the same thing both for him and the fans. \n\nNow the last bit makes a lot of sense since a kid beating someone above kaguya level is insane, but I think that\u2019s setting up what Boruto will fight in the future, kinda like how Naruto defeated Garra which then built up fighting for tailed beasts and stuff.",

Heck, the Kishimoto manga chapters haven't even made it into the anime yet (Kishimoto's first chapter was in January 2021). The people who made Boruto were Kishimoto's assistants who were put in charge of a Naruto sequel after Kishimoto refused. But taking over a manga five years into it is kind of too late to really mold it into something you want so even with Kishimoto continuing the story it's not really his story, especially when he has to write his way to the flash-forward as well, which makes the path even more rigid.\n\nAlso, I don't mind times when Boruto outshines Naruto or Sasuke but it has to happen realistically. When Kakashi got caught by Zabuza, Naruto and Sasuke devised a way to free Kakashi rather than take on Zabuza themselves. In Boruto it seems that Boruto needs to fight the big bad himself rather than doing something to help the more powerful combatant. Also, power escalation isn't happening naturally in Boruto, if you read the manga you know. Kishimoto made things a lot worse in that aspect.",

It wasn't even a fight, they simply used a year worth of budget in Kawaki's introduction. Kakuja Kaneki's first appearance was kinda badass, does it make he's fight vs the instructor guy good ? No fuxk no \n\nCan't handle the truth can't ya ? Just like how i consider all these fight bad you also think of all Boruto's fight as awesome, so please shut your mouth,  if I'm biased you are also too.\n\nIronic how you think Naruto's fandom is the most toxic when Boruto's sub exists, People absolutely downvote anything that doesn't praise the superiority of Boruto. Don't worship Boruto and you're hater worthy of death.\n\ntHe onLy peOpLe wHo sAy Naruto and Sasuke aRe cArYyInG thE sHoW aRe tHe pEoPle wHo dOesn't wAtCh tHe sHow, who's pushing he's opinions again lmao, ignoring the facts is all you do\n\nWasn't Naruto the first place in the popularity poll rofl ? Sadge bruh\n\nI Don't care about anime, in the manga he hasn't done shit without he's karma. Karma is easily the single must bs power i have ever seen in the Naruto universe, how did Boruto get it ? He used the rasengan Naruto gave him, for some random reason Momo could without any touching mark Karma on boruto Boruto, without any explanation Karma has the op abilities like absorbing chakra, teleport, increasing the users physical ability, whatever Karma is compatible with your body or not is also based on your luck, we never got an explanation on why Kawaki and Boruto could become a vessel but somehow Code received another asspull named White karma. \n\nKurama presence made Narutos chakra unstable, meaning if he wasn't there Naruto would've an easier time channelling he's own chakra and cast jutsu. Kurama alone was like  50% of he's power, he has the sage mode, he's an uzumaki which means a lot chakra and life force, he's also a prodigy since he was the person to complete the rasengan, a feat which he's father genius father couldn't.\n\nAh yes my favorite excuse of all-time, hE's A gEniUs sO hE dOesN't nEEd to tRAiN. mInAto gEnEs sKipPeD a gEneRatIon, nAruTo sTuPid bOritto pRodiGy, he accidentally made the vanishing rasengan xD...

So you ignore the anime which fleshed out the characters the world and the lore and focus on the manga which is pretty much a skeleton for the anime the manga is monthly with only 60 chapters how do you expect it to go as in detail as the anime? And karma has to be compatible with the user that\u2019s why Isshiki went through the trouble of looking for Kawaki and Momoshiki literally said Boruto was a perfect vessel and heavily inherited the otsutsuki genes and I never said anything about Boruto being a prodigy because of naruto I said if he wasn\u2019t a prodigy people would\u2019ve been mad and your trying to equate real life biology to a fictional world kakashi literally says that Boruto inherited Minatos Genius and narutos unpredictability so that\u2019s not necessarily true and we know that if you have a powerful parent your most likely to have a higher potential then when compared to a person that comes from a weaker parent",

Ao vs Boruto we saw Boruto struggle first hand with seeing how being a ninja has effected a veteran shinobi during this time we also see Boruto\u2019s struggle with mugino\u2019s death how it made him more resolved etc Kawaki vs Garou was 1 an introduction to Kawaki but also an introduction to Karma and how lethal it can really be this is also around the time Boruto first activates karma team 7 vs Deepa another example of a good fight not only was it decently choreographed but Deepas character was interesting hes what everyone wanted urashiki to be that battle not only introduced us to Kara but it also effected team 7 they realized that they where weak while being considered prodigies in the face of power all of it was meaningless that battle pushed them to train harder then they every did specially Boruto after that loss he trained day and night for some Days so he could find a way to defeat deepa it all made them more resolved after that battle Boruto began analyzing the situation more and pushed him to want to actually get stronger all the fights I sent you where well choreographed gave us more information developed the characters and where entertaining",

The only two arc of filler that I really hate in boruto are those about Cho Cho and the movie star and the one where Mitsuki ran away from the village.\nStill the best filler- and maybe the only one that is really good- is Kakashi Anbu Arc.

Didn't like the first half with kabuto, but the final scenes were amazing. \n\nBorutos filler was dog shit. I didn't really like any of the filler in boruto, which so happens to take up the whole series. The problem with borutos filler is that the filler could be a series all on its own, and it IS a series on its own since, again, there's only like 1 canon arc in boruto, and when I stopped watching boruto there was 0 cannon arcs (150 episodes of straight filler) so it really is just a filler series that isn't canon to a good story. \n\nYou can judge boruto off its filler since the whole show is filler. Almost every episode is pure filler, nothing more. By your logic of not judging boruto off its filler, you'd either have to skip literally over 150 episodes in a row, and go straight to the first canon arc which is like ep 160 or something (idk i don't keep up with shit) or just not judge boruto at all. \n\nIm gonna judge it off its filler, since by the time I stopped watching, it was only filler, meaning it was a legit series but none of it was canon to Naruto so it was its own separate anime universe (thats how anime works. Not every anime series is connected to eachother. They are there own universes) \n\nBoruto is shit, you can't change my mind on that because its just fax, just as much fax as humans will never fully understand the universe since its literally imposible",

At that point your better off just making a new series. I don't plan on going back to boruto any time soon because I'm still tramitized by the character designs and the utter shit that it was (aswell as the voice acting because im a dub watcher and did eventually skip to sub after ep 54 but I didn't like either) as well as the story. \n\nAnd borutos bitchyness.

Also, the anime said that shikadai became a chunin and set up this whole system of where chunin jonin and genin get there missions on separate levels, then immediately contracticted that in the episode which was shit. \n\nThe difference between skipping Naruto filler and boruto filler is that Naruto filler is normally less then 15 episodes at a time for each filler arc, so your only skipping like 15, at most 20 episodes, at a time which is reasonable for any anime, but in borutos case your skipping 160 episodes all at once, which is just ridiculous. At that point your better off just making a new series. I don't plan on going back to boruto any time soon because I'm still tramitized by the character designs and the utter shit that it was (aswell as the voice acting because im a dub watcher and did eventually skip to sub after ep 54 but I didn't like either) as well as the story. \n\nAnd borutos bitchyness.

At Naruto's peak the character writing was second to none and that seeped into everything: world-building, story, and fights. The Pain arc is considered the peak of Naruto because the character writing is molded by the world-building, drives the story, and is expressed in the fights.\n\nI don't really see any of that in Boruto. Boruto ignores Naruto's worldbuilding and doesn't really make a dedicated effort to make its own. It just assumes that you should know things. The character writing is a shadow of Naruto's as most characters don't feel very driven and their conflicts feel shallow rather than entrenched in the world. The power-scaling feels ridiculous even by Naruto standards with 12-year-old Boruto landing saving the day and landing the finishing blow on an Otsutsuki. The most ridiculous Naruto ever got in that aspect was having 12-year-old Konohamaru take down a stationary Pain body, while it was distracted and had its guard down.",

And about that sci-fi sequel, I love that idea but it\u2019s hard to imagine it now with Boruto already there. \n\nAbout the characters\u2019 drives, you can\u2019t see it as much as you did in Naruto since they don\u2019t have tragic backstories but rather make their life moving forward tragic, I like that approach honestly because it feels fresh and new. \n\nAbout Boruto forgetting why people liked Naruto, I think Kishimoto was going for a different approach when it comes to writing Boruto, it\u2019d be boring if he did the same thing both for him and the fans. \n\nNow the last bit makes a lot of sense since a kid beating someone above kaguya level is insane, but I think that\u2019s setting up what Boruto will fight in the future, kinda like how Naruto defeated Garra which then built up fighting for tailed beasts and stuff.",

Heck, the Kishimoto manga chapters haven't even made it into the anime yet (Kishimoto's first chapter was in January 2021). The people who made Boruto were Kishimoto's assistants who were put in charge of a Naruto sequel after Kishimoto refused. But taking over a manga five years into it is kind of too late to really mold it into something you want so even with Kishimoto continuing the story it's not really his story, especially when he has to write his way to the flash-forward as well, which makes the path even more rigid.\n\nAlso, I don't mind times when Boruto outshines Naruto or Sasuke but it has to happen realistically. When Kakashi got caught by Zabuza, Naruto and Sasuke devised a way to free Kakashi rather than take on Zabuza themselves. In Boruto it seems that Boruto needs to fight the big bad himself rather than doing something to help the more powerful combatant. Also, power escalation isn't happening naturally in Boruto, if you read the manga you know. Kishimoto made things a lot worse in that aspect.",

It doesn't even approach saying the anime only content is canon, it just says that the anime won't ever diverge from the manga and that when they're making filler it gets double checked to make sure it doesn't conflict.\n\nIt even says that if they introduce something in the anime it won't affect the manga.

Sadge bruh\n\nI Don't care about anime, in the manga he hasn't done shit without he's karma. Karma is easily the single must bs power i have ever seen in the Naruto universe, how did Boruto get it ? He used the rasengan Naruto gave him, for some random reason Momo could without any touching mark Karma on boruto Boruto, without any explanation Karma has the op abilities like absorbing chakra, teleport, increasing the users physical ability, whatever Karma is compatible with your body or not is also based on your luck, we never got an explanation on why Kawaki and Boruto could become a vessel but somehow Code received another asspull named White karma. \n\nKurama presence made Narutos chakra unstable, meaning if he wasn't there Naruto would've an easier time channelling he's own chakra and cast jutsu. Kurama alone was like  50% of he's power, he has the sage mode, he's an uzumaki which means a lot chakra and life force, he's also a prodigy since he was the person to complete the rasengan, a feat which he's father genius father couldn't.\n\nAh yes my favorite excuse of all-time, hE's A gEniUs sO hE dOesN't nEEd to tRAiN. mInAto gEnEs sKipPeD a gEneRatIon, nAruTo sTuPid bOritto pRodiGy, he accidentally made the vanishing rasengan xD...

So you ignore the anime which fleshed out the characters the world and the lore and focus on the manga which is pretty much a skeleton for the anime the manga is monthly with only 60 chapters how do you expect it to go as in detail as the anime? And karma has to be compatible with the user that\u2019s why Isshiki went through the trouble of looking for Kawaki and Momoshiki literally said Boruto was a perfect vessel and heavily inherited the otsutsuki genes and I never said anything about Boruto being a prodigy because of naruto I said if he wasn\u2019t a prodigy people would\u2019ve been mad and your trying to equate real life biology to a fictional world kakashi literally says that Boruto inherited Minatos Genius and narutos unpredictability so that\u2019s not necessarily true and we know that if you have a powerful parent your most likely to have a higher potential then when compared to a person that comes from a weaker parent",

Ao vs Boruto we saw Boruto struggle first hand with seeing how being a ninja has effected a veteran shinobi during this time we also see Boruto\u2019s struggle with mugino\u2019s death how it made him more resolved etc Kawaki vs Garou was 1 an introduction to Kawaki but also an introduction to Karma and how lethal it can really be this is also around the time Boruto first activates karma team 7 vs Deepa another example of a good fight not only was it decently choreographed but Deepas character was interesting hes what everyone wanted urashiki to be that battle not only introduced us to Kara but it also effected team 7 they realized that they where weak while being considered prodigies in the face of power all of it was meaningless that battle pushed them to train harder then they every did specially Boruto after that loss he trained day and night for some Days so he could find a way to defeat deepa it all made them more resolved after that battle Boruto began analyzing the situation more and pushed him to want to actually get stronger all the fights I sent you where well choreographed gave us more information developed the characters and where entertaining",

            "body": "Not liking Narutos filler is understandable because it did contradict the story at times (that race filler in og Naruto for example right before the roof top fight) and it always happened during epic times, but there was some good filler in there like I personally liked the yota filler, and that one filler arc towards the end of shipuden about Naruto having bug things in his stomach and kurama trying to take over his body and he has to fight himself. Didn't like the first half with kabuto, but the final scenes were amazing. \n\nBorutos filler was dog shit. I didn't really like any of the filler in boruto, which so happens to take up the whole series. The problem with borutos filler is that the filler could be a series all on its own, and it IS a series on its own since, again, there's only like 1 canon arc in boruto, and when I stopped watching boruto there was 0 cannon arcs (150 episodes of straight filler) so it really is just a filler series that isn't canon to a good story. \n\nYou can judge boruto off its filler since the whole show is filler. Almost every episode is pure filler, nothing more. By your logic of not judging boruto off its filler, you'd either have to skip literally over 150 episodes in a row, and go straight to the first canon arc which is like ep 160 or something (idk i don't keep up with shit) or just not judge boruto at all. \n\nIm gonna judge it off its filler, since by the time I stopped watching, it was only filler, meaning it was a legit series but none of it was canon to Naruto so it was its own separate anime universe (thats how anime works. Not every anime series is connected to eachother. They are there own universes) \n\nBoruto is shit, you can't change my mind on that because its just fax, just as much fax as humans will never fully understand the universe since its literally imposible",

I am not here to change your mind, I understand it\u2019s frustrating to watch 150 episodes of filler, but you logic doesn\u2019t make sense to me because Naruto Shippuden and OG Naruto are 55% and 41% filler, consecutively. So I\u2019d have to considerer these two amazing shows as s*it too because of their long fillers, what is not the case. And yes, a lot of people jump hundreds of Naruto episode to not watch the filler, so ig it\u2019s pretty legit to do so in boruto if you want to. \nAgain, it\u2019s mainly the studio fault for not waiting the manga to create more content to the anime, but I just don\u2019t consider boruto s*it cause I read the manga and watched the canon content they have still now and I can say sincerely that it\u2019s one of the best content they have in the Naruto franchise as a whole. \nBut again I understand and respect your opinion, but I just advise you to watch now at least some of the new canon content, which is pretty good.",

Didn't like the first half with kabuto, but the final scenes were amazing. \n\nBorutos filler was dog shit. I didn't really like any of the filler in boruto, which so happens to take up the whole series. The problem with borutos filler is that the filler could be a series all on its own, and it IS a series on its own since, again, there's only like 1 canon arc in boruto, and when I stopped watching boruto there was 0 cannon arcs (150 episodes of straight filler) so it really is just a filler series that isn't canon to a good story. \n\nYou can judge boruto off its filler since the whole show is filler. Almost every episode is pure filler, nothing more. By your logic of not judging boruto off its filler, you'd either have to skip literally over 150 episodes in a row, and go straight to the first canon arc which is like ep 160 or something (idk i don't keep up with shit) or just not judge boruto at all. \n\nIm gonna judge it off its filler, since by the time I stopped watching, it was only filler, meaning it was a legit series but none of it was canon to Naruto so it was its own separate anime universe (thats how anime works. Not every anime series is connected to eachother. They are there own universes) \n\nBoruto is shit, you can't change my mind on that because its just fax, just as much fax as humans will never fully understand the universe since its literally imposible",

At Naruto's peak the character writing was second to none and that seeped into everything: world-building, story, and fights. The Pain arc is considered the peak of Naruto because the character writing is molded by the world-building, drives the story, and is expressed in the fights.\n\nI don't really see any of that in Boruto. Boruto ignores Naruto's worldbuilding and doesn't really make a dedicated effort to make its own. It just assumes that you should know things. The character writing is a shadow of Naruto's as most characters don't feel very driven and their conflicts feel shallow rather than entrenched in the world. The power-scaling feels ridiculous even by Naruto standards with 12-year-old Boruto landing saving the day and landing the finishing blow on an Otsutsuki. The most ridiculous Naruto ever got in that aspect was having 12-year-old Konohamaru take down a stationary Pain body, while it was distracted and had its guard down.",

And about that sci-fi sequel, I love that idea but it\u2019s hard to imagine it now with Boruto already there. \n\nAbout the characters\u2019 drives, you can\u2019t see it as much as you did in Naruto since they don\u2019t have tragic backstories but rather make their life moving forward tragic, I like that approach honestly because it feels fresh and new. \n\nAbout Boruto forgetting why people liked Naruto, I think Kishimoto was going for a different approach when it comes to writing Boruto, it\u2019d be boring if he did the same thing both for him and the fans. \n\nNow the last bit makes a lot of sense since a kid beating someone above kaguya level is insane, but I think that\u2019s setting up what Boruto will fight in the future, kinda like how Naruto defeated Garra which then built up fighting for tailed beasts and stuff.",

Heck, the Kishimoto manga chapters haven't even made it into the anime yet (Kishimoto's first chapter was in January 2021). The people who made Boruto were Kishimoto's assistants who were put in charge of a Naruto sequel after Kishimoto refused. But taking over a manga five years into it is kind of too late to really mold it into something you want so even with Kishimoto continuing the story it's not really his story, especially when he has to write his way to the flash-forward as well, which makes the path even more rigid.\n\nAlso, I don't mind times when Boruto outshines Naruto or Sasuke but it has to happen realistically. When Kakashi got caught by Zabuza, Naruto and Sasuke devised a way to free Kakashi rather than take on Zabuza themselves. In Boruto it seems that Boruto needs to fight the big bad himself rather than doing something to help the more powerful combatant. Also, power escalation isn't happening naturally in Boruto, if you read the manga you know. Kishimoto made things a lot worse in that aspect.",

It wasn't even a fight, they simply used a year worth of budget in Kawaki's introduction. Kakuja Kaneki's first appearance was kinda badass, does it make he's fight vs the instructor guy good ? No fuxk no \n\nCan't handle the truth can't ya ? Just like how i consider all these fight bad you also think of all Boruto's fight as awesome, so please shut your mouth,  if I'm biased you are also too.\n\nIronic how you think Naruto's fandom is the most toxic when Boruto's sub exists, People absolutely downvote anything that doesn't praise the superiority of Boruto. Don't worship Boruto and you're hater worthy of death.\n\ntHe onLy peOpLe wHo sAy Naruto and Sasuke aRe cArYyInG thE sHoW aRe tHe pEoPle wHo dOesn't wAtCh tHe sHow, who's pushing he's opinions again lmao, ignoring the facts is all you do\n\nWasn't Naruto the first place in the popularity poll rofl ? Sadge bruh\n\nI Don't care about anime, in the manga he hasn't done shit without he's karma. Karma is easily the single must bs power i have ever seen in the Naruto universe, how did Boruto get it ? He used the rasengan Naruto gave him, for some random reason Momo could without any touching mark Karma on boruto Boruto, without any explanation Karma has the op abilities like absorbing chakra, teleport, increasing the users physical ability, whatever Karma is compatible with your body or not is also based on your luck, we never got an explanation on why Kawaki and Boruto could become a vessel but somehow Code received another asspull named White karma. \n\nKurama presence made Narutos chakra unstable, meaning if he wasn't there Naruto would've an easier time channelling he's own chakra and cast jutsu. Kurama alone was like  50% of he's power, he has the sage mode, he's an uzumaki which means a lot chakra and life force, he's also a prodigy since he was the person to complete the rasengan, a feat which he's father genius father couldn't.\n\nAh yes my favorite excuse of all-time, hE's A gEniUs sO hE dOesN't nEEd to tRAiN. mInAto gEnEs sKipPeD a gEneRatIon, nAruTo sTuPid bOritto pRodiGy, he accidentally made the vanishing rasengan xD... So fuxking much for a genius\n\nAsuma was the child third hokage Hiruzen, a genius parent doesn't automatically make their kid a genius too, thats not how biology works",

To me the choreography, the meaning behind the fight, and what the fight sets up is what makes it important Kawaki\u2019s fight had top tier choreography it was our introduction to both Kawaki and karma and Kawaki\u2019s attitude that whole fight was straight badass and no I don\u2019t think every fight in Boruto is good nor did I say all the fights in Boruto are good I know there are some good fights just as there are bad fights you just like to donate every Single fight in Boruto as bad except the one where naruto and sasuke where actually winning a fight and while Boruto sub is toxic Naruto random as a whole is toxic go to any social media that has an anime community and I can guarantee that Naruto fandom is more toxic I\u2019m not talking about Reddit I\u2019m talking about Instagram tiktok Twitter Reddit etc everywhere you  will run into obnoxious and disrespectful naruto fans that shit on everyone\u2019s opinion that doesn\u2019t agree with theirs and the only people saying naruto and sasuke carry Boruto and Naruto fanboys that can\u2019t get passed the fact that Naruto isn\u2019t the mc literally the only time you hear people saying that is when they are hating on Boruto and no recent popularity pole Boruto was 1st not Naruto narutos was first in the first popularity pole they did. So you ignore the anime which fleshed out the characters the world and the lore and focus on the manga which is pretty much a skeleton for the anime the manga is monthly with only 60 chapters how do you expect it to go as in detail as the anime? And karma has to be compatible with the user that\u2019s why Isshiki went through the trouble of looking for Kawaki and Momoshiki literally said Boruto was a perfect vessel and heavily inherited the otsutsuki genes and I never said anything about Boruto being a prodigy because of naruto I said if he wasn\u2019t a prodigy people would\u2019ve been mad and your trying to equate real life biology to a fictional world kakashi literally says that Boruto inherited Minatos Genius and narutos unpredictability so that\u2019s not necessarily true and we know that if you have a powerful parent your most likely to have a higher potential then when compared to a person that comes from a weaker parent",

I am not here to change your mind, I understand it\u2019s frustrating to watch 150 episodes of filler, but you logic doesn\u2019t make sense to me because Naruto Shippuden and OG Naruto are 55% and 41% filler, consecutively. So I\u2019d have to considerer these two amazing shows as s*it too because of their long fillers, what is not the case. And yes, a lot of people jump hundreds of Naruto episode to not watch the filler, so ig it\u2019s pretty legit to do so in boruto if you want to. \nAgain, it\u2019s mainly the studio fault for not waiting the manga to create more content to the anime, but I just don\u2019t consider boruto s*it cause I read the manga and watched the canon content they have still now and I can say sincerely that it\u2019s one of the best content they have in the Naruto franchise as a whole. \nBut again I understand and respect your opinion, but I just advise you to watch now at least some of the new canon content, which is pretty good.",

Also, the anime said that shikadai became a chunin and set up this whole system of where chunin jonin and genin get there missions on separate levels, then immediately contracticted that in the episode which was shit. \n\nThe difference between skipping Naruto filler and boruto filler is that Naruto filler is normally less then 15 episodes at a time for each filler arc, so your only skipping like 15, at most 20 episodes, at a time which is reasonable for any anime, but in borutos case your skipping 160 episodes all at once, which is just ridiculous. At that point your better off just making a new series. I don't plan on going back to boruto any time soon because I'm still tramitized by the character designs and the utter shit that it was (aswell as the voice acting because im a dub watcher and did eventually skip to sub after ep 54 but I didn't like either) as well as the story. \n\nAnd borutos bitchyness.

Also, the anime said that shikadai became a chunin and set up this whole system of where chunin jonin and genin get there missions on separate levels, then immediately contracticted that in the episode which was shit. \n\nThe difference between skipping Naruto filler and boruto filler is that Naruto filler is normally less then 15 episodes at a time for each filler arc, so your only skipping like 15, at most 20 episodes, at a time which is reasonable for any anime, but in borutos case your skipping 160 episodes all at once, which is just ridiculous. At that point your better off just making a new series. I don't plan on going back to boruto any time soon because I'm still tramitized by the character designs and the utter shit that it was (aswell as the voice acting because im a dub watcher and did eventually skip to sub after ep 54 but I didn't like either) as well as the story. \n\nAnd borutos bitchyness. He needs to grow the fuck up.",

And about that sci-fi sequel, I love that idea but it\u2019s hard to imagine it now with Boruto already there. \n\nAbout the characters\u2019 drives, you can\u2019t see it as much as you did in Naruto since they don\u2019t have tragic backstories but rather make their life moving forward tragic, I like that approach honestly because it feels fresh and new. \n\nAbout Boruto forgetting why people liked Naruto, I think Kishimoto was going for a different approach when it comes to writing Boruto, it\u2019d be boring if he did the same thing both for him and the fans. \n\nNow the last bit makes a lot of sense since a kid beating someone above kaguya level is insane, but I think that\u2019s setting up what Boruto will fight in the future, kinda like how Naruto defeated Garra which then built up fighting for tailed beasts and stuff.",

Heck, the Kishimoto manga chapters haven't even made it into the anime yet (Kishimoto's first chapter was in January 2021). The people who made Boruto were Kishimoto's assistants who were put in charge of a Naruto sequel after Kishimoto refused. But taking over a manga five years into it is kind of too late to really mold it into something you want so even with Kishimoto continuing the story it's not really his story, especially when he has to write his way to the flash-forward as well, which makes the path even more rigid.\n\nAlso, I don't mind times when Boruto outshines Naruto or Sasuke but it has to happen realistically. When Kakashi got caught by Zabuza, Naruto and Sasuke devised a way to free Kakashi rather than take on Zabuza themselves. In Boruto it seems that Boruto needs to fight the big bad himself rather than doing something to help the more powerful combatant. Also, power escalation isn't happening naturally in Boruto, if you read the manga you know. Kishimoto made things a lot worse in that aspect.",

It wasn't even a fight, they simply used a year worth of budget in Kawaki's introduction. Kakuja Kaneki's first appearance was kinda badass, does it make he's fight vs the instructor guy good ? No fuxk no \n\nCan't handle the truth can't ya ? Just like how i consider all these fight bad you also think of all Boruto's fight as awesome, so please shut your mouth,  if I'm biased you are also too.\n\nIronic how you think Naruto's fandom is the most toxic when Boruto's sub exists, People absolutely downvote anything that doesn't praise the superiority of Boruto. Don't worship Boruto and you're hater worthy of death.\n\ntHe onLy peOpLe wHo sAy Naruto and Sasuke aRe cArYyInG thE sHoW aRe tHe pEoPle wHo dOesn't wAtCh tHe sHow, who's pushing he's opinions again lmao, ignoring the facts is all you do\n\nWasn't Naruto the first place in the popularity poll rofl ? Sadge bruh\n\nI Don't care about anime, in the manga he hasn't done shit without he's karma. Karma is easily the single must bs power i have ever seen in the Naruto universe, how did Boruto get it ? He used the rasengan Naruto gave him, for some random reason Momo could without any touching mark Karma on boruto Boruto, without any explanation Karma has the op abilities like absorbing chakra, teleport, increasing the users physical ability, whatever Karma is compatible with your body or not is also based on your luck, we never got an explanation on why Kawaki and Boruto could become a vessel but somehow Code received another asspull named White karma. \n\nKurama presence made Narutos chakra unstable, meaning if he wasn't there Naruto would've an easier time channelling he's own chakra and cast jutsu. Kurama alone was like  50% of he's power, he has the sage mode, he's an uzumaki which means a lot chakra and life force, he's also a prodigy since he was the person to complete the rasengan, a feat which he's father genius father couldn't.\n\nAh yes my favorite excuse of all-time, hE's A gEniUs sO hE dOesN't nEEd to tRAiN. mInAto gEnEs sKipPeD a gEneRatIon, nAruTo sTuPid bOritto pRodiGy, he accidentally made the vanishing rasengan xD... So fuxking much for a genius\n\nAsuma was the child third hokage Hiruzen, a genius parent doesn't automatically make their kid a genius too, thats not how biology works",

To me the choreography, the meaning behind the fight, and what the fight sets up is what makes it important Kawaki\u2019s fight had top tier choreography it was our introduction to both Kawaki and karma and Kawaki\u2019s attitude that whole fight was straight badass and no I don\u2019t think every fight in Boruto is good nor did I say all the fights in Boruto are good I know there are some good fights just as there are bad fights you just like to donate every Single fight in Boruto as bad except the one where naruto and sasuke where actually winning a fight and while Boruto sub is toxic Naruto random as a whole is toxic go to any social media that has an anime community and I can guarantee that Naruto fandom is more toxic I\u2019m not talking about Reddit I\u2019m talking about Instagram tiktok Twitter Reddit etc everywhere you  will run into obnoxious and disrespectful naruto fans that shit on everyone\u2019s opinion that doesn\u2019t agree with theirs and the only people saying naruto and sasuke carry Boruto and Naruto fanboys that can\u2019t get passed the fact that Naruto isn\u2019t the mc literally the only time you hear people saying that is when they are hating on Boruto and no recent popularity pole Boruto was 1st not Naruto narutos was first in the first popularity pole they did. So you ignore the anime which fleshed out the characters the world and the lore and focus on the manga which is pretty much a skeleton for the anime the manga is monthly with only 60 chapters how do you expect it to go as in detail as the anime? And karma has to be compatible with the user that\u2019s why Isshiki went through the trouble of looking for Kawaki and Momoshiki literally said Boruto was a perfect vessel and heavily inherited the otsutsuki genes and I never said anything about Boruto being a prodigy because of naruto I said if he wasn\u2019t a prodigy people would\u2019ve been mad and your trying to equate real life biology to a fictional world kakashi literally says that Boruto inherited Minatos Genius and narutos unpredictability so that\u2019s not necessarily true and we know that if you have a powerful parent your most likely to have a higher potential then when compared to a person that comes from a weaker parent",

Power scalling in Naruto was similar because it did have genin defeating high level shinobi, but it was always by strategy and technique. Besides Naruto, but he used the 9 tails to defeat high level ninja that he can't beat normally. Boruto doesn't have that. I understand boruto getting the final attack on that otsosuki in the movie because that rasengan was made from Narutos Chakra, and Naruto wanted boruto to get battle experience, but every other time a genin other then Mitsuki defeats a high level oponet, I have to punch my screen.",

Heck, the Kishimoto manga chapters haven't even made it into the anime yet (Kishimoto's first chapter was in January 2021). The people who made Boruto were Kishimoto's assistants who were put in charge of a Naruto sequel after Kishimoto refused. But taking over a manga five years into it is kind of too late to really mold it into something you want so even with Kishimoto continuing the story it's not really his story, especially when he has to write his way to the flash-forward as well, which makes the path even more rigid.\n\nAlso, I don't mind times when Boruto outshines Naruto or Sasuke but it has to happen realistically. When Kakashi got caught by Zabuza, Naruto and Sasuke devised a way to free Kakashi rather than take on Zabuza themselves. In Boruto it seems that Boruto needs to fight the big bad himself rather than doing something to help the more powerful combatant. Also, power escalation isn't happening naturally in Boruto, if you read the manga you know. Kishimoto made things a lot worse in that aspect.",

It doesn't even approach saying the anime only content is canon, it just says that the anime won't ever diverge from the manga and that when they're making filler it gets double checked to make sure it doesn't conflict.\n\nIt even says that if they introduce something in the anime it won't affect the manga. That's like the definition of noncanon.",

To me the choreography, the meaning behind the fight, and what the fight sets up is what makes it important Kawaki\u2019s fight had top tier choreography it was our introduction to both Kawaki and karma and Kawaki\u2019s attitude that whole fight was straight badass and no I don\u2019t think every fight in Boruto is good nor did I say all the fights in Boruto are good I know there are some good fights just as there are bad fights you just like to donate every Single fight in Boruto as bad except the one where naruto and sasuke where actually winning a fight and while Boruto sub is toxic Naruto random as a whole is toxic go to any social media that has an anime community and I can guarantee that Naruto fandom is more toxic I\u2019m not talking about Reddit I\u2019m talking about Instagram tiktok Twitter Reddit etc everywhere you  will run into obnoxious and disrespectful naruto fans that shit on everyone\u2019s opinion that doesn\u2019t agree with theirs and the only people saying naruto and sasuke carry Boruto and Naruto fanboys that can\u2019t get passed the fact that Naruto isn\u2019t the mc literally the only time you hear people saying that is when they are hating on Boruto and no recent popularity pole Boruto was 1st not Naruto narutos was first in the first popularity pole they did. So you ignore the anime which fleshed out the characters the world and the lore and focus on the manga which is pretty much a skeleton for the anime the manga is monthly with only 60 chapters how do you expect it to go as in detail as the anime? And karma has to be compatible with the user that\u2019s why Isshiki went through the trouble of looking for Kawaki and Momoshiki literally said Boruto was a perfect vessel and heavily inherited the otsutsuki genes and I never said anything about Boruto being a prodigy because of naruto I said if he wasn\u2019t a prodigy people would\u2019ve been mad and your trying to equate real life biology to a fictional world kakashi literally says that Boruto inherited Minatos Genius and narutos unpredictability so that\u2019s not necessarily true and we know that if you have a powerful parent your most likely to have a higher potential then when compared to a person that comes from a weaker parent",

Power scalling in Naruto was similar because it did have genin defeating high level shinobi, but it was always by strategy and technique. Besides Naruto, but he used the 9 tails to defeat high level ninja that he can't beat normally. Boruto doesn't have that. I understand boruto getting the final attack on that otsosuki in the movie because that rasengan was made from Narutos Chakra, and Naruto wanted boruto to get battle experience, but every other time a genin other then Mitsuki defeats a high level oponet, I have to punch my screen.",

Power scalling in Naruto was similar because it did have genin defeating high level shinobi, but it was always by strategy and technique. Besides Naruto, but he used the 9 tails to defeat high level ninja that he can't beat normally. Boruto doesn't have that. I understand boruto getting the final attack on that otsosuki in the movie because that rasengan was made from Narutos Chakra, and Naruto wanted boruto to get battle experience, but every other time a genin other then Mitsuki defeats a high level oponet, I have to punch my screen.",

The show has been getting better recently since it has been adapting manga content but I still don\u2019t feel that it is as good as the original naruto was.",

Besides Naruto, but he used the 9 tails to defeat high level ninja that he can't beat normally. Boruto doesn't have that. I understand boruto getting the final attack on that otsosuki in the movie because that rasengan was made from Narutos Chakra, and Naruto wanted boruto to get battle experience, but every other time a genin other then Mitsuki defeats a high level oponet, I have to punch my screen.",
