    "body": "Quite often I see mentioned that happy people don\u2019t post about their arrangements. Because of this many newbies and others on this forum have no compass for what a relationship of this nature looks like. I thought I\u2019d share something my guy did for me in the hopes that it can be a baseline for others. \n\nMy SD and I have been together for four months. In that time we have had good and bad days. He\u2019s not the best at communicating and I tend to purposely overlook this which leads to me becoming overly emotional while my feelings fester. We are working on these small nits we have. \n\nOne thing we do well, though, is support each other. So when I was told I needed to have a medical procedure my guy immediately offered to take the day off for me. This was the type of medical procedure even a husband would balk at attending. \n\nThe day of the event he feeds me a big breakfast and then accompanies me over to the office. He waited with me in the waiting room and even offered to go back with me. The procedure took longer than usual, was more difficult (and painful) than we\u2019d expected, but was thankfully successful. Just having him in the waiting room was soothing to me.\n\nAfter the procedure he holds me up while we walk to the hotel he booked next door. He grabs Tylenol and water for me and then tucks me into bed. I fall asleep and wake up hours later to him texting with friends on his phone. He hadn\u2019t moved the entire time. \n\nHe encourages me to get food, even though I\u2019m not that hungry. We talk about going out after dinner but halfway through dinner I\u2019m in pain again. He escorts me back to the room, plys me with more Tylenol and water  and runs his fingers through my hair until I fall asleep again. I wake up later and he\u2019s still laying next to me, happily looking at his phone. He ensures I\u2019m okay to head home and we part ways. \n\nI could\u2019ve easily done this procedure myself. I could\u2019ve gone alone and made it home to bed and recuperated alone. Instead my guy blew an entire day off to watch me sleep. He didn\u2019t once complain. He happily amused himself while I was snoozing and doted on me when I was awake. He was tender and loving. He gave me something I didn\u2019t know I needed: Comfort. I felt restored after our day together. It was as if laying next to him helped heal me. \n\nSometimes I honestly don\u2019t know what he derives from this relationship. He indulges my every whim and takes care of me when I\u2019m down. We cuddle, and talk and laugh together. I make jokes about the fact that he\u2019s dating a white girl. He tries (and fails) to get me to eat something other than Hamburgers and Steak. Sometimes I ogle the way his boxers hug his groin. Mostly he buys me books and does whatever I want. Except for that one time he refused to see the Trans-Siberian Orchestra with me. That he refused. \n\nThis is what our relationship looks like. Us supporting each other. But mostly him supporting me... and watching me sleep. \n\n(Still iso a Trans-Siberian Orchestra partner.)",

            "body": "What a great post and thought-provoking question you pose.  Makes me want to tell my story here.  \n\nThis needs to start with a bit of background on my situation.   I have spent my entire working life starting and building companies.   There is a downside to this for some of us.  It can be all-consuming.   You spend a serious amount of time on planes and continually dealing with complex business challenges.  Friendships and relationships suffer.   People you are close to can pull away, especially if you experience success and enter a different level financially.   For example, I had a really good friend tell me that people like to associate with others who are similar to them from a financial and career perspective.   He is the only one who came out and said it.  But I know others felt the same way.  \n\nI entered the bowl because of a long term and irreversible decline in my wife\u2019s health.  She is at the point now, where travel is such a challenge, that she cannot really do it any more.  \n\nOne of my post-career goals has always been to relax and see the places around the world that have always eluded me.  It was going to be one of my rewards for all the long hours and crazy work intensity.  I made a major change in my business life this year, when I chose to step out of an operating role.  I was ready for that reward.  I have known the day was coming for a couple of years now.  But a burning question emerged when I looked at the facts.  Was I going to experience these things on my own?  My wife was no longer capable, and longer term friends had drifted away.  \n\nIn parallel to all of the above, I entered the bowl.  With reasonable success.  Not really knowing what to expect.  Spent some time with a a small number of women.  Got quite close to one in particular, but had to stop seeing her due to never ending drama.  Which was too bad, because she was great in other ways.\n\nThen a little over 8 months ago, I took a flyer and messaged someone with an outrageous profile.  She seemed wrong on so many levels.  She was just 21 at the time.  Creating what I thought was an insurmountable age gap.  She had some arrangement experience, but with guys who had vanilla potential. I ended up being her first arrangement where there was no possibility of it ever being vanilla.  So our first month or so was kind of awkward and difficult.  But we saw enough in each other to keep going.  \n\nThings blossomed a couple of months in.  We took a trip together and it was awesome.  We got closer and closer.  I have posted a few times about our travel fun.\n\nThen my world totally changed this fall.  I finally made the decision to exit from my day-to-day role at my company.  Within days of that, SB told me she was moving away to go to school.  I immediately jumped to the conclusion that this would end the SR.  She was very upset about this, and we decided to keep going in spite of the distance.  After her move, there was a period of freedom for her before school in January.  We have done three trips now in under two months.  \n\nSomehow the distance has gotten us closer.  On our trip last week, she confided in me on how hard the move has been.  I was only the second person she ever told this to.  She has come to trust me with her feelings and fears.  She was crying in my arms, while at the same time feeling bad about being emotional on a great vacation.  I assured her that everything was OK.  I make this point to illustrate how far beyond transactional we have become.  \n\nIf you have read this far, you are likely wondering how all of this ties together.  Her school start date has been pushed for 9 months, and she has a job where she can come and go as she pleases.  And I am free to go anywhere and do whatever I want.  My wife is pushing me to get out there and enjoy myself.  She is happy to see me free of the unrelenting pressure and stress of running a demanding tech company.  \n\nThis thread posed the question about what your arrangement looks like.  For me, the standard stuff is there.  Combined with a level of affection I never expected.  \n\nBut somehow, this SB has come into my life at the same time that I made the biggest life change since getting married.  As already mentioned, I had a burning question about whether I would need to experience my new-found freedom on my own.  Then along comes a person, who I enjoy immensely who happens to also be free to experience the world.  Who has made it clear that she want to have those experiences with me.\n\nSo my arrangement has morphed from what most people expect in a great SR, to an SR plus travel partner.  We are in the middle of planning our next adventure for January.  We think we know the destination, and she had been begging me over text to go there.  \n\nSomeday soon, I expect she finds a boyfriend, and this will all be over.  But in the meantime, I will jump in with both feet and enjoy it.  Somehow I got very lucky for a number of factors to combine together to help me through a major life change.  With an attractive and compelling 22 year old.  Who would have thought it?",

Of course there\u2019s something we\u2014especially I\u2014have to work on. Yet, we are so good at being there for each other. Thick and thin, we\u2019re always there.\n\nA while ago, I\u2019ve dealt with a heartbreaking situation with a man I\u2019ve met during the summer. He was manipulating me. This was my first ever experience with manipulation. I didn\u2019t know what I was doing wrong. He was making me question my sanity. Thankfully, I was (and still am) in a SR with an amazing man during that time. This man let me come over, late at night, so I could cry on his shoulder. This man let me use his t-shirt for my snot and tears. Throughout the moment was peace and comfort. That was all I needed\u2014oh, and him.\n\nI am in the happiest SR I\u2019ve ever been in... out of my total two.... Lol. And I cannot thank him enough for all he\u2019s done for me. Hopefully, I\u2019m doing the exact much he\u2019s doing for me... or more.",

Maybe our actions that show love are to make up our lack of saying it.",
