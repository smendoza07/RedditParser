I get that doing so once or maybe twice might trigger his brother\u2019s hate fuel, but doing so constantly puts Sasuke in a very volatile mental state.

I'm a firm believer that the idea of Itachi being a good guy wasn't set in stone, at least, and wasn't set in stone for a while afterwards. Itachi was meant to be a bad guy, then come his introduction Kishimoto was toying with the idea. It wasn't until into Shippudden that he'd decided to go full good-guy Itachi.",

He put Sasuke and Kakashi in the same critical state. Like others have said, Itachi can kill using Tsukuyomi instantly if he chose to.\n\nThink about what he accomplished from those actions. He critically injured his brother enough to show that he had no lingering attachment to his old life in front of Kisame, but also gave Sasuke and Kakashi enough leeway to receive medical help in the form of someone like Tsunade. He planned to die by Sasuke's hand and pretty much boosted Sasuke's motivation to seek power and attempt to carry out the kill against him. And he effortlessly took out Kakashi; one of the top leaf ninja, showing Danzo that he was very much still a threat if Danzo tried something. \n\nIt's some sociopathic Machiavellian shit but it worked. I've always held the stance that Itachi is not a good person. I think he's a cruel and a very detached individual, but those traits are what make him the ideal shinobi for actions such as this. He can carry out deeds like this with surgical precision without letting emotion deter him for the most part.",

There\u2019s nothing to imply he\u2019s near his limit.

This is the stupidest part to me. If he thought he could kill him, he should have done it immediately and hauled his corpse to show the clan there was a reasonable suspicion by the leaders besides Danzo and show the leaders the clan wasn't responsible for the attack.\n\nDanzo didn't care though, he wanted them dead so he could take their eyes. He proved this by taking Shisui's eye who was one of the most loyal shinibi Konoha had. He also had an Aburame poison him but it wasn't shown in the anime. He also talked to Obito, thinking he was Madara and didn't do anything with that information. So ya the coup was 100% justified, I'd do the same thing if I only had the info Fugaku had.\n\nSasuke did Konoha a favor. Everything Danzo did was to increase his power but he weakened Konoha or helped its enemies but no he isn't a traitor. His strategic ability is just absolute garbage.",

The only way he could have made it worse for him was if he showed him that he raped Mikoto.\n\nAlso with his mastery of genjutsu do you really think he couldn't make Asuma, Kurenai, or Kakashi report whatever he wanted without their knowledge?

He could sneak up on him when he didn't have his guard up, and I never heard that Hashirama cells made it so he didn't need to sleep.\n\nIf Black Zetsu could move freely without Madara sensing him to backstab him Itachi could do the same. Sharingan does not have 360 vision like Byakugan or even greater than what a normal person's field of view.\n\nAnd remember how Konan was able to send paper bombs into his kamui? Instead of setting him on fire aim for where Kamui open when he tries so he can't get away that way. Then he'd have a chance to hit him just like Minato.\n\nAnd I didn't say just kill him lol. Konan had about 15 years to work on a plan and he knew about Izanagi so he could prep for it. I don't think Izami would work on him since Itachi didn't know about Rin but worst case scenario he sacrifices his eye with Tsukuyomi since presumambly Obito could break out of it anyway.",

Why would Itachi risk his entire plan on a desperate gamble to kill Obito early, when his original plan already accounted for that and would have WORKED if not for Obito\u2019s hax.\n\nThis was literally Itachi\u2019s entire purpose for living. Having Sasuke hate and kill him and take his eyes and get stronger. There\u2019s literally no point risking his life in a fight he probably won\u2019t win. \n\nThe black zetsu point is useless because that\u2019s a special ability unique to zetsu. No one else can make their presence invisible like them. \n\nItachi didn\u2019t even know about Kamui so I\u2019m not going to bother dealing with how a hypothetical fight would go. It\u2019s just a huge unnecessary risk for Itachi to take.\n\nEdit: plus, the idea of sacrificing his eye is awful because he specifically wants to give his eyes to Sasuke",

I know Kishimoto said he was planning to make Itachi a good guy from the start, and I agree that was certainly the most prominent option, but I feel like he left a lot of \u201copenings\u201d in his character in case he ever wanted to go another route.\n\nCase in point: Torturing Sasuke by *constantly* reliving the Uchiha Massacre. I get that doing so once or maybe twice might trigger his brother\u2019s hate fuel, but doing so constantly puts Sasuke in a very volatile mental state. It\u2019s not like Itachi could guarantee Sasuke wouldn\u2019t just kill himself out of grief or something along those lines.",

I'm a firm believer that the idea of Itachi being a good guy wasn't set in stone, at least, and wasn't set in stone for a while afterwards. Itachi was meant to be a bad guy, then come his introduction Kishimoto was toying with the idea. It wasn't until into Shippudden that he'd decided to go full good-guy Itachi.",

He put Sasuke and Kakashi in the same critical state. Like others have said, Itachi can kill using Tsukuyomi instantly if he chose to.\n\nThink about what he accomplished from those actions. He critically injured his brother enough to show that he had no lingering attachment to his old life in front of Kisame, but also gave Sasuke and Kakashi enough leeway to receive medical help in the form of someone like Tsunade. He planned to die by Sasuke's hand and pretty much boosted Sasuke's motivation to seek power and attempt to carry out the kill against him. And he effortlessly took out Kakashi; one of the top leaf ninja, showing Danzo that he was very much still a threat if Danzo tried something. \n\nIt's some sociopathic Machiavellian shit but it worked. I've always held the stance that Itachi is not a good person. I think he's a cruel and a very detached individual, but those traits are what make him the ideal shinobi for actions such as this. He can carry out deeds like this with surgical precision without letting emotion deter him for the most part.",

Using it on Kakashi left it risky for him to use it again immediately in another fight (so they withdrew) and then he rested enough that he had at least 2 uses again to go get Naruto.

This is the stupidest part to me. If he thought he could kill him, he should have done it immediately and hauled his corpse to show the clan there was a reasonable suspicion by the leaders besides Danzo and show the leaders the clan wasn't responsible for the attack.\n\nDanzo didn't care though, he wanted them dead so he could take their eyes. He proved this by taking Shisui's eye who was one of the most loyal shinibi Konoha had. He also had an Aburame poison him but it wasn't shown in the anime. He also talked to Obito, thinking he was Madara and didn't do anything with that information. So ya the coup was 100% justified, I'd do the same thing if I only had the info Fugaku had.\n\nSasuke did Konoha a favor. Everything Danzo did was to increase his power but he weakened Konoha or helped its enemies but no he isn't a traitor. His strategic ability is just absolute garbage.",

The only way he could have made it worse for him was if he showed him that he raped Mikoto.\n\nAlso with his mastery of genjutsu do you really think he couldn't make Asuma, Kurenai, or Kakashi report whatever he wanted without their knowledge?

Sharingan does not have 360 vision like Byakugan or even greater than what a normal person's field of view.\n\nAnd remember how Konan was able to send paper bombs into his kamui? Instead of setting him on fire aim for where Kamui open when he tries so he can't get away that way. Then he'd have a chance to hit him just like Minato.\n\nAnd I didn't say just kill him lol. Konan had about 15 years to work on a plan and he knew about Izanagi so he could prep for it. I don't think Izami would work on him since Itachi didn't know about Rin but worst case scenario he sacrifices his eye with Tsukuyomi since presumambly Obito could break out of it anyway.",

Having Sasuke hate and kill him and take his eyes and get stronger. There\u2019s literally no point risking his life in a fight he probably won\u2019t win. \n\nThe black zetsu point is useless because that\u2019s a special ability unique to zetsu. No one else can make their presence invisible like them. \n\nItachi didn\u2019t even know about Kamui so I\u2019m not going to bother dealing with how a hypothetical fight would go. It\u2019s just a huge unnecessary risk for Itachi to take.\n\nEdit: plus, the idea of sacrificing his eye is awful because he specifically wants to give his eyes to Sasuke",

Itachi was meant to be a bad guy, then come his introduction Kishimoto was toying with the idea. It wasn't until into Shippudden that he'd decided to go full good-guy Itachi.",

Like others have said, Itachi can kill using Tsukuyomi instantly if he chose to.\n\nThink about what he accomplished from those actions. He critically injured his brother enough to show that he had no lingering attachment to his old life in front of Kisame, but also gave Sasuke and Kakashi enough leeway to receive medical help in the form of someone like Tsunade. He planned to die by Sasuke's hand and pretty much boosted Sasuke's motivation to seek power and attempt to carry out the kill against him. And he effortlessly took out Kakashi; one of the top leaf ninja, showing Danzo that he was very much still a threat if Danzo tried something. \n\nIt's some sociopathic Machiavellian shit but it worked. I've always held the stance that Itachi is not a good person. I think he's a cruel and a very detached individual, but those traits are what make him the ideal shinobi for actions such as this. He can carry out deeds like this with surgical precision without letting emotion deter him for the most part.",

The whole explanation in the manga is that he has to sell his role as a villain and they argue post-facto that it was a warning to Danzo.  \n\nThe whole plan to put down the Uchiha rebellion by committing a genocide was insane, and he is supposed to have loved the village so much that he was fine with the mass fratricide he was ordered to do.  \n\nThen he further tries to sell his role by 1) never telling anyone (dumb), and 2) sadistically torturing both Kakashi and his allegedly beloved brother and nearly killing them both.  \n\nBut you think this is good writing, so I guess you\u2019re entitled to that opinion.",

This is the stupidest part to me. If he thought he could kill him, he should have done it immediately and hauled his corpse to show the clan there was a reasonable suspicion by the leaders besides Danzo and show the leaders the clan wasn't responsible for the attack.\n\nDanzo didn't care though, he wanted them dead so he could take their eyes. He proved this by taking Shisui's eye who was one of the most loyal shinibi Konoha had. He also had an Aburame poison him but it wasn't shown in the anime. He also talked to Obito, thinking he was Madara and didn't do anything with that information. So ya the coup was 100% justified, I'd do the same thing if I only had the info Fugaku had.\n\nSasuke did Konoha a favor. Everything Danzo did was to increase his power but he weakened Konoha or helped its enemies but no he isn't a traitor. His strategic ability is just absolute garbage.",

It doesn't have to happen exactly like I said but there are so many much more useful options he could have taken.\n\nAlso what made him think tramautizing Sasuke as much as he possibly could, maximizing his chances of taking revenge on Konoha was a good idea? The only way he could have made it worse for him was if he showed him that he raped Mikoto.\n\nAlso with his mastery of genjutsu do you really think he couldn't make Asuma, Kurenai, or Kakashi report whatever he wanted without their knowledge?

Sharingan does not have 360 vision like Byakugan or even greater than what a normal person's field of view.\n\nAnd remember how Konan was able to send paper bombs into his kamui? Instead of setting him on fire aim for where Kamui open when he tries so he can't get away that way. Then he'd have a chance to hit him just like Minato.\n\nAnd I didn't say just kill him lol. Konan had about 15 years to work on a plan and he knew about Izanagi so he could prep for it. I don't think Izami would work on him since Itachi didn't know about Rin but worst case scenario he sacrifices his eye with Tsukuyomi since presumambly Obito could break out of it anyway.",

Having Sasuke hate and kill him and take his eyes and get stronger. There\u2019s literally no point risking his life in a fight he probably won\u2019t win. \n\nThe black zetsu point is useless because that\u2019s a special ability unique to zetsu. No one else can make their presence invisible like them. \n\nItachi didn\u2019t even know about Kamui so I\u2019m not going to bother dealing with how a hypothetical fight would go. It\u2019s just a huge unnecessary risk for Itachi to take.\n\nEdit: plus, the idea of sacrificing his eye is awful because he specifically wants to give his eyes to Sasuke",

I get that doing so once or maybe twice might trigger his brother\u2019s hate fuel, but doing so constantly puts Sasuke in a very volatile mental state.

I'm a firm believer that the idea of Itachi being a good guy wasn't set in stone, at least, and wasn't set in stone for a while afterwards. Itachi was meant to be a bad guy, then come his introduction Kishimoto was toying with the idea. It wasn't until into Shippudden that he'd decided to go full good-guy Itachi.",

Like others have said, Itachi can kill using Tsukuyomi instantly if he chose to.\n\nThink about what he accomplished from those actions. He critically injured his brother enough to show that he had no lingering attachment to his old life in front of Kisame, but also gave Sasuke and Kakashi enough leeway to receive medical help in the form of someone like Tsunade. He planned to die by Sasuke's hand and pretty much boosted Sasuke's motivation to seek power and attempt to carry out the kill against him. And he effortlessly took out Kakashi; one of the top leaf ninja, showing Danzo that he was very much still a threat if Danzo tried something. \n\nIt's some sociopathic Machiavellian shit but it worked. I've always held the stance that Itachi is not a good person. I think he's a cruel and a very detached individual, but those traits are what make him the ideal shinobi for actions such as this. He can carry out deeds like this with surgical precision without letting emotion deter him for the most part.",

Using it on Kakashi left it risky for him to use it again immediately in another fight (so they withdrew) and then he rested enough that he had at least 2 uses again to go get Naruto. He uses 2 MS activations and then has to retreat again because he doesn't think he can take Jiriaya without MS.   \n\n\nThere's nothing I've seen that refutes that reading of what happens.",

The whole explanation in the manga is that he has to sell his role as a villain and they argue post-facto that it was a warning to Danzo.  \n\nThe whole plan to put down the Uchiha rebellion by committing a genocide was insane, and he is supposed to have loved the village so much that he was fine with the mass fratricide he was ordered to do.  \n\nThen he further tries to sell his role by 1) never telling anyone (dumb), and 2) sadistically torturing both Kakashi and his allegedly beloved brother and nearly killing them both.  \n\nBut you think this is good writing, so I guess you\u2019re entitled to that opinion.",

This is the stupidest part to me. If he thought he could kill him, he should have done it immediately and hauled his corpse to show the clan there was a reasonable suspicion by the leaders besides Danzo and show the leaders the clan wasn't responsible for the attack.\n\nDanzo didn't care though, he wanted them dead so he could take their eyes. He proved this by taking Shisui's eye who was one of the most loyal shinibi Konoha had. He also had an Aburame poison him but it wasn't shown in the anime. He also talked to Obito, thinking he was Madara and didn't do anything with that information. So ya the coup was 100% justified, I'd do the same thing if I only had the info Fugaku had.\n\nSasuke did Konoha a favor. Everything Danzo did was to increase his power but he weakened Konoha or helped its enemies but no he isn't a traitor. His strategic ability is just absolute garbage.",

The only way he could have made it worse for him was if he showed him that he raped Mikoto.\n\nAlso with his mastery of genjutsu do you really think he couldn't make Asuma, Kurenai, or Kakashi report whatever he wanted without their knowledge?

He could sneak up on him when he didn't have his guard up, and I never heard that Hashirama cells made it so he didn't need to sleep.\n\nIf Black Zetsu could move freely without Madara sensing him to backstab him Itachi could do the same. Sharingan does not have 360 vision like Byakugan or even greater than what a normal person's field of view.\n\nAnd remember how Konan was able to send paper bombs into his kamui? Instead of setting him on fire aim for where Kamui open when he tries so he can't get away that way. Then he'd have a chance to hit him just like Minato.\n\nAnd I didn't say just kill him lol. Konan had about 15 years to work on a plan and he knew about Izanagi so he could prep for it. I don't think Izami would work on him since Itachi didn't know about Rin but worst case scenario he sacrifices his eye with Tsukuyomi since presumambly Obito could break out of it anyway.",

Why would Itachi risk his entire plan on a desperate gamble to kill Obito early, when his original plan already accounted for that and would have WORKED if not for Obito\u2019s hax.\n\nThis was literally Itachi\u2019s entire purpose for living. Having Sasuke hate and kill him and take his eyes and get stronger. There\u2019s literally no point risking his life in a fight he probably won\u2019t win. \n\nThe black zetsu point is useless because that\u2019s a special ability unique to zetsu. No one else can make their presence invisible like them. \n\nItachi didn\u2019t even know about Kamui so I\u2019m not going to bother dealing with how a hypothetical fight would go. It\u2019s just a huge unnecessary risk for Itachi to take.\n\nEdit: plus, the idea of sacrificing his eye is awful because he specifically wants to give his eyes to Sasuke",

I get that doing so once or maybe twice might trigger his brother\u2019s hate fuel, but doing so constantly puts Sasuke in a very volatile mental state.

I'm a firm believer that the idea of Itachi being a good guy wasn't set in stone, at least, and wasn't set in stone for a while afterwards. Itachi was meant to be a bad guy, then come his introduction Kishimoto was toying with the idea. It wasn't until into Shippudden that he'd decided to go full good-guy Itachi.",

He critically injured his brother enough to show that he had no lingering attachment to his old life in front of Kisame, but also gave Sasuke and Kakashi enough leeway to receive medical help in the form of someone like Tsunade. He planned to die by Sasuke's hand and pretty much boosted Sasuke's motivation to seek power and attempt to carry out the kill against him. And he effortlessly took out Kakashi; one of the top leaf ninja, showing Danzo that he was very much still a threat if Danzo tried something. \n\nIt's some sociopathic Machiavellian shit but it worked. I've always held the stance that Itachi is not a good person. I think he's a cruel and a very detached individual, but those traits are what make him the ideal shinobi for actions such as this. He can carry out deeds like this with surgical precision without letting emotion deter him for the most part.",

Itachi literally says this and then turns off his Sharingan for the only time I can think of in the entire show.\n\nKisame \\*says\\* he's risking over using it (meaning he's nearing the limits of his ability to use it safely); Itachi is visibly strained after using it on Kakashi, and doesn't move once afterward except to retreat.  \n\n\nI specifically said he was \"Dangerously close to the limits of his MS\" which I think is fair. Using it on Kakashi left it risky for him to use it again immediately in another fight (so they withdrew) and then he rested enough that he had at least 2 uses again to go get Naruto. He uses 2 MS activations and then has to retreat again because he doesn't think he can take Jiriaya without MS.   \n\n\nThere's nothing I've seen that refutes that reading of what happens.",

This is the stupidest part to me. If he thought he could kill him, he should have done it immediately and hauled his corpse to show the clan there was a reasonable suspicion by the leaders besides Danzo and show the leaders the clan wasn't responsible for the attack.\n\nDanzo didn't care though, he wanted them dead so he could take their eyes. He proved this by taking Shisui's eye who was one of the most loyal shinibi Konoha had. He also had an Aburame poison him but it wasn't shown in the anime. He also talked to Obito, thinking he was Madara and didn't do anything with that information. So ya the coup was 100% justified, I'd do the same thing if I only had the info Fugaku had.\n\nSasuke did Konoha a favor. Everything Danzo did was to increase his power but he weakened Konoha or helped its enemies but no he isn't a traitor. His strategic ability is just absolute garbage.",

Sharingan does not have 360 vision like Byakugan or even greater than what a normal person's field of view.\n\nAnd remember how Konan was able to send paper bombs into his kamui? Instead of setting him on fire aim for where Kamui open when he tries so he can't get away that way. Then he'd have a chance to hit him just like Minato.\n\nAnd I didn't say just kill him lol. Konan had about 15 years to work on a plan and he knew about Izanagi so he could prep for it.

There\u2019s literally no point risking his life in a fight he probably won\u2019t win. \n\nThe black zetsu point is useless because that\u2019s a special ability unique to zetsu. No one else can make their presence invisible like them. \n\nItachi didn\u2019t even know about Kamui so I\u2019m not going to bother dealing with how a hypothetical fight would go. It\u2019s just a huge unnecessary risk for Itachi to take.\n\nEdit: plus, the idea of sacrificing his eye is awful because he specifically wants to give his eyes to Sasuke",

I get that doing so once or maybe twice might trigger his brother\u2019s hate fuel, but doing so constantly puts Sasuke in a very volatile mental state.

I'm a firm believer that the idea of Itachi being a good guy wasn't set in stone, at least, and wasn't set in stone for a while afterwards. Itachi was meant to be a bad guy, then come his introduction Kishimoto was toying with the idea. It wasn't until into Shippudden that he'd decided to go full good-guy Itachi.",

He critically injured his brother enough to show that he had no lingering attachment to his old life in front of Kisame, but also gave Sasuke and Kakashi enough leeway to receive medical help in the form of someone like Tsunade. He planned to die by Sasuke's hand and pretty much boosted Sasuke's motivation to seek power and attempt to carry out the kill against him. And he effortlessly took out Kakashi; one of the top leaf ninja, showing Danzo that he was very much still a threat if Danzo tried something. \n\nIt's some sociopathic Machiavellian shit but it worked. I've always held the stance that Itachi is not a good person. I think he's a cruel and a very detached individual, but those traits are what make him the ideal shinobi for actions such as this. He can carry out deeds like this with surgical precision without letting emotion deter him for the most part.",

For one, the Akatsuki would be after him.

He could sneak up on him when he didn't have his guard up, and I never heard that Hashirama cells made it so he didn't need to sleep.\n\nIf Black Zetsu could move freely without Madara sensing him to backstab him Itachi could do the same. Sharingan does not have 360 vision like Byakugan or even greater than what a normal person's field of view.\n\nAnd remember how Konan was able to send paper bombs into his kamui? Instead of setting him on fire aim for where Kamui open when he tries so he can't get away that way. Then he'd have a chance to hit him just like Minato.\n\nAnd I didn't say just kill him lol. Konan had about 15 years to work on a plan and he knew about Izanagi so he could prep for it. I don't think Izami would work on him since Itachi didn't know about Rin but worst case scenario he sacrifices his eye with Tsukuyomi since presumambly Obito could break out of it anyway.",

Why would Itachi risk his entire plan on a desperate gamble to kill Obito early, when his original plan already accounted for that and would have WORKED if not for Obito\u2019s hax.\n\nThis was literally Itachi\u2019s entire purpose for living. Having Sasuke hate and kill him and take his eyes and get stronger. There\u2019s literally no point risking his life in a fight he probably won\u2019t win. \n\nThe black zetsu point is useless because that\u2019s a special ability unique to zetsu. No one else can make their presence invisible like them. \n\nItachi didn\u2019t even know about Kamui so I\u2019m not going to bother dealing with how a hypothetical fight would go. It\u2019s just a huge unnecessary risk for Itachi to take.\n\nEdit: plus, the idea of sacrificing his eye is awful because he specifically wants to give his eyes to Sasuke",

I get that doing so once or maybe twice might trigger his brother\u2019s hate fuel, but doing so constantly puts Sasuke in a very volatile mental state. It\u2019s not like Itachi could guarantee Sasuke wouldn\u2019t just kill himself out of grief or something along those lines.",

Itachi was meant to be a bad guy, then come his introduction Kishimoto was toying with the idea. It wasn't until into Shippudden that he'd decided to go full good-guy Itachi.",

He critically injured his brother enough to show that he had no lingering attachment to his old life in front of Kisame, but also gave Sasuke and Kakashi enough leeway to receive medical help in the form of someone like Tsunade. He planned to die by Sasuke's hand and pretty much boosted Sasuke's motivation to seek power and attempt to carry out the kill against him. And he effortlessly took out Kakashi; one of the top leaf ninja, showing Danzo that he was very much still a threat if Danzo tried something. \n\nIt's some sociopathic Machiavellian shit but it worked. I've always held the stance that Itachi is not a good person. I think he's a cruel and a very detached individual, but those traits are what make him the ideal shinobi for actions such as this. He can carry out deeds like this with surgical precision without letting emotion deter him for the most part.",

Using it on Kakashi left it risky for him to use it again immediately in another fight (so they withdrew) and then he rested enough that he had at least 2 uses again to go get Naruto. He uses 2 MS activations and then has to retreat again because he doesn't think he can take Jiriaya without MS.   \n\n\nThere's nothing I've seen that refutes that reading of what happens.",

When she actually has over 200+ chapters of foreshadowing.\n\nHe also had the Obito plot line in mind since the beginning of the series.\n\nKnew how the series would end back in part 1, etc etc.",

Sharingan does not have 360 vision like Byakugan or even greater than what a normal person's field of view.\n\nAnd remember how Konan was able to send paper bombs into his kamui? Instead of setting him on fire aim for where Kamui open when he tries so he can't get away that way. Then he'd have a chance to hit him just like Minato.\n\nAnd I didn't say just kill him lol. Konan had about 15 years to work on a plan and he knew about Izanagi so he could prep for it. I don't think Izami would work on him since Itachi didn't know about Rin but worst case scenario he sacrifices his eye with Tsukuyomi since presumambly Obito could break out of it anyway.",

Having Sasuke hate and kill him and take his eyes and get stronger. There\u2019s literally no point risking his life in a fight he probably won\u2019t win. \n\nThe black zetsu point is useless because that\u2019s a special ability unique to zetsu.

Using it on Kakashi left it risky for him to use it again immediately in another fight (so they withdrew) and then he rested enough that he had at least 2 uses again to go get Naruto.

Instead of setting him on fire aim for where Kamui open when he tries so he can't get away that way. Then he'd have a chance to hit him just like Minato.\n\nAnd I didn't say just kill him lol. Konan had about 15 years to work on a plan and he knew about Izanagi so he could prep for it. I don't think Izami would work on him since Itachi didn't know about Rin but worst case scenario he sacrifices his eye with Tsukuyomi since presumambly Obito could break out of it anyway.",

Why would Itachi risk his entire plan on a desperate gamble to kill Obito early, when his original plan already accounted for that and would have WORKED if not for Obito\u2019s hax.\n\nThis was literally Itachi\u2019s entire purpose for living. Having Sasuke hate and kill him and take his eyes and get stronger. There\u2019s literally no point risking his life in a fight he probably won\u2019t win. \n\nThe black zetsu point is useless because that\u2019s a special ability unique to zetsu. No one else can make their presence invisible like them. \n\nItachi didn\u2019t even know about Kamui so I\u2019m not going to bother dealing with how a hypothetical fight would go. It\u2019s just a huge unnecessary risk for Itachi to take.\n\nEdit: plus, the idea of sacrificing his eye is awful because he specifically wants to give his eyes to Sasuke",

Sharingan does not have 360 vision like Byakugan or even greater than what a normal person's field of view.\n\nAnd remember how Konan was able to send paper bombs into his kamui? Instead of setting him on fire aim for where Kamui open when he tries so he can't get away that way. Then he'd have a chance to hit him just like Minato.\n\nAnd I didn't say just kill him lol. Konan had about 15 years to work on a plan and he knew about Izanagi so he could prep for it.

Having Sasuke hate and kill him and take his eyes and get stronger. There\u2019s literally no point risking his life in a fight he probably won\u2019t win. \n\nThe black zetsu point is useless because that\u2019s a special ability unique to zetsu.

Using it on Kakashi left it risky for him to use it again immediately in another fight (so they withdrew) and then he rested enough that he had at least 2 uses again to go get Naruto.

For one, the Akatsuki would be after him. He would\u2019ve have a safe haven anymore. \nSasuke himself would question why Itachi decided to kill the Akatsuki leader, etc. \n\nYour argument is very shortsighted. He cannot just casually kill Obito and everything will be handy dandy.",

He could sneak up on him when he didn't have his guard up, and I never heard that Hashirama cells made it so he didn't need to sleep.\n\nIf Black Zetsu could move freely without Madara sensing him to backstab him Itachi could do the same. Sharingan does not have 360 vision like Byakugan or even greater than what a normal person's field of view.\n\nAnd remember how Konan was able to send paper bombs into his kamui? Instead of setting him on fire aim for where Kamui open when he tries so he can't get away that way. Then he'd have a chance to hit him just like Minato.\n\nAnd I didn't say just kill him lol. Konan had about 15 years to work on a plan and he knew about Izanagi so he could prep for it. I don't think Izami would work on him since Itachi didn't know about Rin but worst case scenario he sacrifices his eye with Tsukuyomi since presumambly Obito could break out of it anyway.",

Having Sasuke hate and kill him and take his eyes and get stronger. There\u2019s literally no point risking his life in a fight he probably won\u2019t win. \n\nThe black zetsu point is useless because that\u2019s a special ability unique to zetsu. No one else can make their presence invisible like them. \n\nItachi didn\u2019t even know about Kamui so I\u2019m not going to bother dealing with how a hypothetical fight would go. It\u2019s just a huge unnecessary risk for Itachi to take.\n\nEdit: plus, the idea of sacrificing his eye is awful because he specifically wants to give his eyes to Sasuke",

Using it on Kakashi left it risky for him to use it again immediately in another fight (so they withdrew) and then he rested enough that he had at least 2 uses again to go get Naruto.

Itachi literally says this and then turns off his Sharingan for the only time I can think of in the entire show.\n\nKisame \\*says\\* he's risking over using it (meaning he's nearing the limits of his ability to use it safely); Itachi is visibly strained after using it on Kakashi, and doesn't move once afterward except to retreat.  \n\n\nI specifically said he was \"Dangerously close to the limits of his MS\" which I think is fair. Using it on Kakashi left it risky for him to use it again immediately in another fight (so they withdrew) and then he rested enough that he had at least 2 uses again to go get Naruto. He uses 2 MS activations and then has to retreat again because he doesn't think he can take Jiriaya without MS.   \n\n\nThere's nothing I've seen that refutes that reading of what happens.",
