I would go to a stylists and tell them you want a lot of layers like his. Its best to do layers with a pro bc it's very hard to do on your own and very easy to fuck up. You don't wanna fuck up layers bc it could take a while to grow out. Other than that maybe just experiment with styling products. K pop hair usually has a ton of them in it to hold it that way.\n\nIf you want to be extra you could try curling it and then brushing it out before using styling products so it looks more wavy like his. Might take some practice to nail this method though. Or get a perm, but if you go that route just keep in mind that your hair will still grow straight, so you'll end up having straight hair on top and wavy at the bottom.\n\nEdit: maybe try a different hair dresser since the first couldn't nail the layers.",

You should be able to voice what you want improved upon, and either the same person or someone more experienced should improve upon it for little to no cost.\n\nWhoever does your hair to your liking, whether it be the same person or the more experienced one, plan to go to them again. Sometimes you just need to voice your opinion on the what you would like done differently to be on the same page. Think of your hair as a \u2018rough draft\u2019, if you don\u2019t say anything to make improvements that\u2019s on you that you\u2019ve \u2018submitted\u2019 something unedited. \n\nIf you still don\u2019t like your hair after someone fixes up on it, or if the salon/barber/stylist doesn\u2019t offer a fix up\u2014go somewhere else. Unfortunately pictures we see of celebrities are the outcome of very successful makeup artists / hair dressers / stylists. Most people don\u2019t have the ability to have experts thrown at them, we have to search a little and work within our means. The outcome you have on your hair looks really classic/traditional, wouldn\u2019t say it is bad but you can\u2019t expect zany new looks from an ordinary stylist. Most stylists we come across stand to serve the majority, they won\u2019t try something \u2018different\u2019 if you don\u2019t specifically ask.",

I think a little product in your hair might help as well, so you get more of the textured and pieces look. I would let it grow out for another month or so instead of getting it recut now. If anything, you could get the neck and sideburn redone now but everything else I\u2019d leave alone. It\u2019s not exactly what you asked for, but I don\u2019t think it looks bad.  Also, what type of hair dresser do you go to? I\u2019d try to find one that specializes in men\u2019s or Asian hair cuts. I live in Chicago, and my friend in high school used to drive to Chinatown every few months to get his done because he said others don\u2019t always work with the shape and texture of his hair well.",

Add more moisture (masque or deep condition, don't use oil) try adding a product that will add texture or give you a piecey look when its wet so it dries with a wave. I'd try a salt spray and blow drying while scrunching on cool air, or a paste that claims to give a textured look, scrunch it in and let it air dry.\n\nThat's all a guess, I haven't ever styled asian hair but those are ways to bring out waves. \n\nThere's some pretty good tutorials for sea salt sprays for mens short hair on youtube\n\nGood luck!",

You don't wanna fuck up layers bc it could take a while to grow out. Other than that maybe just experiment with styling products. K pop hair usually has a ton of them in it to hold it that way.\n\nIf you want to be extra you could try curling it and then brushing it out before using styling products so it looks more wavy like his. Might take some practice to nail this method though. Or get a perm, but if you go that route just keep in mind that your hair will still grow straight, so you'll end up having straight hair on top and wavy at the bottom.\n\nEdit: maybe try a different hair dresser since the first couldn't nail the layers.",

I would go to a stylists and tell them you want a lot of layers like his. Its best to do layers with a pro bc it's very hard to do on your own and very easy to fuck up. You don't wanna fuck up layers bc it could take a while to grow out. Other than that maybe just experiment with styling products. K pop hair usually has a ton of them in it to hold it that way.\n\nIf you want to be extra you could try curling it and then brushing it out before using styling products so it looks more wavy like his. Might take some practice to nail this method though. Or get a perm, but if you go that route just keep in mind that your hair will still grow straight, so you'll end up having straight hair on top and wavy at the bottom.\n\nEdit: maybe try a different hair dresser since the first couldn't nail the layers.",
