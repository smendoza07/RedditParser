If you're Korean you'll notice 98% of comments are love and support on her social media.\n\nLastly, if any woman cut her hair short, there's unfortunately always going to be a some grumbling among any community. Whether the celebrity is from Hollywood, Bollywood, Taiwan, Japan, Europe, etc. That's just naturally the way it is. I love her and so do many other Koreans. So please don't get the wrong idea.",
