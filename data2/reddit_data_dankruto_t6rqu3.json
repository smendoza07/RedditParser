Strong people will have strong kids so it looks like nepotism.\n\nThe village has incentives to put future super elites under the tutelage of super elites.\n\nI mean it would be a waste if you had a Kage level ninja and a Kage potential kid and you didn\u2019t do everything you can to match them up.\n\nYes, Senju are OP but they are the strongest clan, it\u2019s not a huge surprise that a senju who traces her linniage to Mr.Ninja God and his brother is strong.\n\nIn your model they wouldn\u2019t put the most op kids with the most op team leader and that isn\u2019t a good idea.",

Sakura is not only smarter but has more experience than any other girl in Konoha. It\u2019s cannon that Sakura is the LEADER of the medical corp. Also I\u2019m not 100% on Tsunade age but 70 is still a long life. And when else aside from the war has Sakura used 100healings? She has saved Naruto MULTIPLE times, Hinata literally made the 9 tails come out cause she got bodied by pain. Some of the Sakura hate is funny but at some point it\u2019s like.. did you even pay attention to the anime? Lol",

Plus it seems like you don\u2019t even need to active 100 healings to reap some of its benefits like rapid healing.

Sakura is not only smarter but has more experience than any other girl in Konoha. It\u2019s cannon that Sakura is the LEADER of the medical corp. Also I\u2019m not 100% on Tsunade age but 70 is still a long life. And when else aside from the war has Sakura used 100healings? She has saved Naruto MULTIPLE times, Hinata literally made the 9 tails come out cause she got bodied by pain. Some of the Sakura hate is funny but at some point it\u2019s like.. did you even pay attention to the anime? Lol",

Sakura is not only smarter but has more experience than any other girl in Konoha. It\u2019s cannon that Sakura is the LEADER of the medical corp. Also I\u2019m not 100% on Tsunade age but 70 is still a long life. And when else aside from the war has Sakura used 100healings? She has saved Naruto MULTIPLE times, Hinata literally made the 9 tails come out cause she got bodied by pain. Some of the Sakura hate is funny but at some point it\u2019s like.. did you even pay attention to the anime? Lol",

Sakura is not only smarter but has more experience than any other girl in Konoha. It\u2019s cannon that Sakura is the LEADER of the medical corp. Also I\u2019m not 100% on Tsunade age but 70 is still a long life. And when else aside from the war has Sakura used 100healings? She has saved Naruto MULTIPLE times, Hinata literally made the 9 tails come out cause she got bodied by pain.

Sakura is not only smarter but has more experience than any other girl in Konoha. It\u2019s cannon that Sakura is the LEADER of the medical corp. Also I\u2019m not 100% on Tsunade age but 70 is still a long life. And when else aside from the war has Sakura used 100healings? She has saved Naruto MULTIPLE times, Hinata literally made the 9 tails come out cause she got bodied by pain. Some of the Sakura hate is funny but at some point it\u2019s like.. did you even pay attention to the anime? Lol",
