However, he made it clear he is really seeking a vanilla GF. This is a man who is very well off and can more than afford to be financially supportive. He's been texting me wanting to get together and I've been avoiding telling him why I stopped responding...but that conversation is happening soon.

Of course if nothing happens you invite a different girl next time.\n\nI know a guy who use to organize a lot of things like that in his \u201820s.  Had a lot of rich friends.  Guys would chip in 30k each and go some where cool.  Then he would organize 30 girls or so for the trip.  And a lot of the guys were trust fund kids born if trophy wives so reasonable looking.  When they wanted vacations they wanted fun places with a bunch of girls around.  Kinda like low key bilzerian stuff.  Experiental dating is real especially with the excess wealth the rich have now.",

Guys would chip in 30k each and go some where cool.  Then he would organize 30 girls or so for the trip.  And a lot of the guys were trust fund kids born if trophy wives so reasonable looking.  When they wanted vacations they wanted fun places with a bunch of girls around.  Kinda like low key bilzerian stuff.  Experiental dating is real especially with the excess wealth the rich have now.",

I think that\u2019s not a bad idea, but I\u2019d also extend that to SDs in search.",

Guys would chip in 30k each and go some where cool.  Then he would organize 30 girls or so for the trip.  And a lot of the guys were trust fund kids born if trophy wives so reasonable looking.
