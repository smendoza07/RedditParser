    "body": "I feel like with Kwangsoo gone, we can now focus more on other members and their chemistry. I really loved all of his shenanigans, but I have to admit that he used overshadow the other members and had so much focus on him. I don\u2019t blame him, because we all know what a hard-worker he is, always giving his best on the show. But I\u2019m also enjoying the episodes without him, everything is just hilarious and the members are so funny!! Also loving the \u201clet\u2019s call Kwangsoo\u201d joke, really shows how much they miss him! \n\nAnd lastly, I\u2019m so impressed with everything that Bopil is bringing to the table! And his interactions with the cast is so funny. I hope they keep up the good work and continue making a great show for a few more years!",

There\u2019s no silly or outrageous KS moment, but they are finding other ways to make their audience laugh. It also helps that Bo Pil\u2019s savage side comments and the captions make the show extra funny.",

It reminded me of when So Min first tried to do some traitor stuff, or when a guest tries to double cross Kwang Soo or Ha Ha and gets completely schooled on it. Or even Lee Da Hee repeatedly trusting Kwang Soo only to get betrayed each time.\n\nAnd it was even funnier because ultimately they all 3 hurt themselves. Ha Ha got an ok role but they clearly didn't think about it the way KJK and JSJ did, which is that if they donate enough, they'll all 3 get good roles. They had so much money left and it was completely useless. Like Kwang Soo a few months ago mentioning he'd find Running Man money in his pocket at home, where it's useless, and ask himself why he went so far to get it.",

Or even Lee Da Hee repeatedly trusting Kwang Soo only to get betrayed each time.\n\nAnd it was even funnier because ultimately they all 3 hurt themselves. Ha Ha got an ok role but they clearly didn't think about it the way KJK and JSJ did, which is that if they donate enough, they'll all 3 get good roles. They had so much money left and it was completely useless. Like Kwang Soo a few months ago mentioning he'd find Running Man money in his pocket at home, where it's useless, and ask himself why he went so far to get it.",
