It\u2019s not the tool that\u2019s used to execute the cut, it\u2019s completely dependent on if that person is capable of translating what they hear, to your head, or what they see in a photo to your head. Try another salon, and another cutter. If you went to a barber, do the same.",

The vibe I got was you don\u2019t even do hair, which I think sausage lot. The sides of this cut are actually not long enough to fit a finger to cut over. It doesn\u2019t mean that you could ask to have the sides done a touch longer to have them cut that way, but it isn\u2019t the way the art was done.

Have the bangs reach down to the middle of your forehead. Tell him to blend the top of your hair into the 3 on the sides, leaving a little bit longer so you can push the hair behind your ears. \n\nThis hair is reflective of this but after a few weeks of growth. You need to be able to find your part line and use it (Gosling style) but not a super hard part line because it doesn't work with the look.\n\nAlso you need a good pomade, for this look I use Reuzel pink, best hold of any pomade I've ever bought.\n\nIf that's too complicated message me and we can chat.",

And before I could say anything those clippers were cutting. I\u2019m like well guess I\u2019m getting a fade now awesome. Then she cut each section to length then faded them out and by the time she was done it was way shorter than I wanted and higher up, just a total shit show\"",

It\u2019s not the tool that\u2019s used to execute the cut, it\u2019s completely dependent on if that person is capable of translating what they hear, to your head, or what they see in a photo to your head.

The vibe I got was you don\u2019t even do hair, which I think sausage lot. The sides of this cut are actually not long enough to fit a finger to cut over. It doesn\u2019t mean that you could ask to have the sides done a touch longer to have them cut that way, but it isn\u2019t the way the art was done.

You obviously can\u2019t have a rational & adult interaction so I\u2019m not wasting anymore time responding to you... at least now you know what an NVQ in Hairdressing is, a qualification that is dedicated to hair, unlike the \u2018jack of all trades, master of none\u2019 cosmetology license.

When you suggested how to do the cut, you directly discredited what I said. Had you simply said here is a different way, or this is how I would do it, maybe I would have felt different. The vibe I got was you don\u2019t even do hair, which I think sausage lot. The sides of this cut are actually not long enough to fit a finger to cut over. It doesn\u2019t mean that you could ask to have the sides done a touch longer to have them cut that way, but it isn\u2019t the way the art was done. When a laymen tells me how to do my job , it can feel personal. Sue me.",
