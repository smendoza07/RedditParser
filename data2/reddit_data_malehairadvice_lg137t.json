First off, check out r/curlyhair and follow their method, brought my hair back from feeling like dead grass after a month. Basically, toss your shampoos and conditioners, get new ones that don't have sulfates, silicones, or parabens in them, STOP shampooing your hair everyday. Haven't used that shit in months. Use conditioner and use a fair amount. Don't blow dry, don't towel dry either. Use a t-shirt or just air that shit out. Use a leave conditioner and argan oil, should keep you nice and soft. Make sure your pomade doesn't have the ingredients above either. Honestly, I also sleep with a beanie on and its worked wonders but that may just be me. \n\nStay jammed.",

Recommendable oils my #1 is cloud control but it's pricey, shear revival saw bones is good or just get some argan oil or jojoba oil from amazon for around $20 you get a 4oz that will last a long time and is good for skin too. From there if you want to use styling products figure out if you want to lean towards looser, more natural looking matte styles or tighter, slicker and higher sheen styles or experiment with both back and forth. The drug store stuff isn't all that great but some of it isn't total trash, I think I remember the old spice spiffy pomade and texture paste being reasonable enough to use but I prefer the better brands (lockharts, shear revival, flagship, reuzel to name a few). If you want really slick and tight and reliable styles look into oil based pomades but they have a learning curve and don't wash easily and can be unforgiving for beginners.",
