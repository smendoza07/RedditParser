His appetite was treated as a gag and he hated being called fat which contradicts the fact that he needs the fat for his jutsus. In addition to that he had realistic proportions.\n\nFatgums eating habits were introduced to be due to his powers from the get go (and the link between fat and power is much more obviou) and his proportions are really unrealistic when fat. He also openly embraces the fact he's fat bc obviously putting on weight is a conscious choice of his . Not to mention that we already have choji as his predecessor and thus many fans were already familiar to the concept of characters using their fat reserves to turn them into a powerup. Choji on the other hand was for most fans the first character they've seen do that. I actually legit don't know if there even were any characters from other franchises/stories before choji that did that.",

His appetite was treated as a gag and he hated being called fat which contradicts the fact that he needs the fat for his jutsus. In addition to that he had realistic proportions.\n\nFatgums eating habits were introduced to be due to his powers from the get go (and the link between fat and power is much more obviou) and his proportions are really unrealistic when fat. He also openly embraces the fact he's fat bc obviously putting on weight is a conscious choice of his . Not to mention that we already have choji as his predecessor and thus many fans were already familiar to the concept of characters using their fat reserves to turn them into a powerup. Choji on the other hand was for most fans the first character they've seen do that. I actually legit don't know if there even were any characters from other franchises/stories before choji that did that.",

His appetite was treated as a gag and he hated being called fat which contradicts the fact that he needs the fat for his jutsus. In addition to that he had realistic proportions.\n\nFatgums eating habits were introduced to be due to his powers from the get go (and the link between fat and power is much more obviou) and his proportions are really unrealistic when fat. He also openly embraces the fact he's fat bc obviously putting on weight is a conscious choice of his . Not to mention that we already have choji as his predecessor and thus many fans were already familiar to the concept of characters using their fat reserves to turn them into a powerup. Choji on the other hand was for most fans the first character they've seen do that. I actually legit don't know if there even were any characters from other franchises/stories before choji that did that.",
