The initial trading factory gave rise to the settlement around Fort Amsterdam. The fort was situated on the strategic southern tip of the island of Manhattan and was meant to defend the fur trade operations of the Dutch West India Company in the North River (Hudson River). In 1624, it became a provincial extension of the Dutch Republic and was designated as the capital of the province in 1625.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/dankruto/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",

And it wouldn't make much sense calling it a special seal of the Hyuga clan at that point. Lastly if it really worked like that, then it would also mean the seal is weak seeing as all it needs is chakra, doesn't add up to the fact that they have been using this to keep the Byakugan from falling into the wrong hands for generations.",

The initial trading factory gave rise to the settlement around Fort Amsterdam. The fort was situated on the strategic southern tip of the island of Manhattan and was meant to defend the fur trade operations of the Dutch West India Company in the North River (Hudson River). In 1624, it became a provincial extension of the Dutch Republic and was designated as the capital of the province in 1625.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/dankruto/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",

Moreover it was clarified that only the main branch Hyuga had access to it's activation as a form of disciplining the branch members. If it were easily triggered via channeling chakra through it then it would suggest that everyone(who knows the hand signs) including the branch members themselves could access it too. And it wouldn't make much sense calling it a special seal of the Hyuga clan at that point. Lastly if it really worked like that, then it would also mean the seal is weak seeing as all it needs is chakra, doesn't add up to the fact that they have been using this to keep the Byakugan from falling into the wrong hands for generations.",

The initial trading factory gave rise to the settlement around Fort Amsterdam. The fort was situated on the strategic southern tip of the island of Manhattan and was meant to defend the fur trade operations of the Dutch West India Company in the North River (Hudson River). In 1624, it became a provincial extension of the Dutch Republic and was designated as the capital of the province in 1625.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/dankruto/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",

I bet that it does not take a seal to mess up a person\u2019s brain.  You could just pump chakra at random into a person\u2019s skull and it would kill them.  Also do keep in mind that if you are capable of getting close enough to a hyuga that you can tap their forehead with your fingers as an enemy combatant they are probably doomed anyway.  So I would understand that you can\u2019t remotely activate it from a distance with out secret knowledge or whatever.  But I bet you can cause it to malfunction by pumping chakra into it via skin contact.  If that seal malfunctioned it would be a death sentence.",

They wouldn\u2019t want the ability to completely disable a branch member to fall into just anyone\u2019s hands, that\u2019s only for a the very specific instance of when they attack a main family member.

Moreover it was clarified that only the main branch Hyuga had access to it's activation as a form of disciplining the branch members. If it were easily triggered via channeling chakra through it then it would suggest that everyone(who knows the hand signs) including the branch members themselves could access it too. And it wouldn't make much sense calling it a special seal of the Hyuga clan at that point. Lastly if it really worked like that, then it would also mean the seal is weak seeing as all it needs is chakra, doesn't add up to the fact that they have been using this to keep the Byakugan from falling into the wrong hands for generations.",

The initial trading factory gave rise to the settlement around Fort Amsterdam. The fort was situated on the strategic southern tip of the island of Manhattan and was meant to defend the fur trade operations of the Dutch West India Company in the North River (Hudson River). In 1624, it became a provincial extension of the Dutch Republic and was designated as the capital of the province in 1625.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/dankruto/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",

Of course, the thing about jonin being able to use it is pure speculation and shouldn't be taken seriously but maybe the seal reacts to touch as well? Idk. I think this came before the reveal of the seal so it might just be foreshadowing",

And it wouldn't make much sense calling it a special seal of the Hyuga clan at that point. Lastly if it really worked like that, then it would also mean the seal is weak seeing as all it needs is chakra, doesn't add up to the fact that they have been using this to keep the Byakugan from falling into the wrong hands for generations.",

The initial trading factory gave rise to the settlement around Fort Amsterdam. The fort was situated on the strategic southern tip of the island of Manhattan and was meant to defend the fur trade operations of the Dutch West India Company in the North River (Hudson River). In 1624, it became a provincial extension of the Dutch Republic and was designated as the capital of the province in 1625.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/dankruto/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",

I bet that it does not take a seal to mess up a person\u2019s brain.  You could just pump chakra at random into a person\u2019s skull and it would kill them.  Also do keep in mind that if you are capable of getting close enough to a hyuga that you can tap their forehead with your fingers as an enemy combatant they are probably doomed anyway.  So I would understand that you can\u2019t remotely activate it from a distance with out secret knowledge or whatever.  But I bet you can cause it to malfunction by pumping chakra into it via skin contact.  If that seal malfunctioned it would be a death sentence.",

I\u2019m sure anyone who gets chakra pumped directly into their brain would suffer damage, the seal wouldn\u2019t matter and frankly I think that would be a terrible strategic choice if it did. They wouldn\u2019t want the ability to completely disable a branch member to fall into just anyone\u2019s hands, that\u2019s only for a the very specific instance of when they attack a main family member.

Moreover it was clarified that only the main branch Hyuga had access to it's activation as a form of disciplining the branch members. If it were easily triggered via channeling chakra through it then it would suggest that everyone(who knows the hand signs) including the branch members themselves could access it too. And it wouldn't make much sense calling it a special seal of the Hyuga clan at that point. Lastly if it really worked like that, then it would also mean the seal is weak seeing as all it needs is chakra, doesn't add up to the fact that they have been using this to keep the Byakugan from falling into the wrong hands for generations.",

Moreover it was clarified that only the main branch Hyuga had access to it's activation as a form of disciplining the branch members. If it were easily triggered via channeling chakra through it then it would suggest that everyone(who knows the hand signs) including the branch members themselves could access it too. And it wouldn't make much sense calling it a special seal of the Hyuga clan at that point. Lastly if it really worked like that, then it would also mean the seal is weak seeing as all it needs is chakra, doesn't add up to the fact that they have been using this to keep the Byakugan from falling into the wrong hands for generations.",
