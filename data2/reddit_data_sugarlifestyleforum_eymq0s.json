    "body": "I did what you're not supposed to do and I started sugaring because I had less than a week to not get evicted for lack of rent.\n\nI vetted profiles and I did M&Gs that went nowhere and I shoplifted panties from Walmart for the first few dates because all mine had holes. I do my absolute best to keep my sugar and vanilla lives separate, including funds, and by now  (a few months in) I have nearly $3k saved up from a variety of SDs, one-time meetings, M&G gifts, and two fairly short-term but steady arrangements. I got a second minimum wage job so if I lost my first one for taking too many evening shifts off I could still maybe have utilities.\n\nI hate sugaring. I hate going out on dates with men who could be my father if he weren't dead and who expect me to call them Daddy while they finger me too damn hard. I hate smiling and laughing and playing along with jokes that aren't funny. I hate these men.\n\nBut this is more money than I've had in my entire life. I can tell my roommate \"let's go out for dinner\" without meaning \"I'm too burnt out to cook so let's hope my card doesn't overdraft on a Cup'o'Noodles.\" I can afford clothes that fit, even if they are from Walmart or Target. I can buy makeup without walking across town to get to the Dollar General. Heck, I can drive across town without counting every mile and wondering if I would be able to get enough gas to drive two states away if my mother had an emergency. I bought fruit the first week. I spent $20 on nothing but fruit and it was LOVELY.\n\nSo how the hell do I convince myself I'd be better off without it? It should be a no-brainer - shared rent and ramen probably adds up to less than years of therapy does... but if I stay in this lifestyle I could be able afford all the therapy I need. I could travel - really travel. I'm GOOD at this! I spent long enough in Goodwill clothes to know how to make them look, maybe not designer, but good enough! I spent long enough in high school theater classes to know how to push my feelings down and put completely new ones there! I could pay off my mother's mortgage someday if I try hard enough and get over it.\n\nSo how do I do it? How do I believe I'm worth more than this?\n\n\nEDIT: Thanks y'all. I think I just needed a firm kick into reality. I appreciate all the support and advice so much. I'm sorry I can't respond to everyone specifically",

If you can try to find another SB or SD as a penpal to chat with and that will help you deal with everything.\n\nFirst suggestion - Find a happy medium between not sugaring at all and doing it the way you are now. Find a 35-40yo married guy who you are at least a little attracted to. Then go on a few dates first to build up some chemistry. There is a good chance that, that type of guy is going to offer a lower allowance but it's a relationship that you won't feel bad about. Doing that plus a normal job might be enough money to live comfortably but not extravagantly.\n\nSecond suggestion - Try being a stripper. If you are as good as you say you might be able to do well at that and limit your physical intimacy to a level you are more comfortable with.\n\nThird suggestion is more of a criticism. I have got to be a little hard on you here girl. If you are having a bad time because some guy is fingering you too hard, some of that might be on you. Speak up, say what you want, a lot of SDs truly WANT you to have a good time or to make it as pleasurable as possible.",

So I recently was lucky enough to find a SD who isn\u2019t much older than me, is attractive, has manners, and I don\u2019t hate fucking him at all. It\u2019s not awkward in public because we look like a regular couple. Sure, he doesn\u2019t pay me as much as an old fat guy would have to but at least it\u2019s not taking the mental toll on me that that would. \n\nFocus on the future. Focus on supporting yourself through sugaring while finding a real career path. If you have money right now that\u2019s great, but make sure it isn\u2019t taking too large of a mental toll and make sure you\u2019re getting some mentoring in as well. Sounds like you\u2019ve had it rough and deserve a stable and happy future. Take what you deserve in this life girl.",

To do that, though, she needs to be able to stand on her own two feet.  I've always seen sugaring as a fun way to get some luxuries I couldn't otherwise afford.  If you need men's money, they have you trapped.  You sound like you're feeling terribly trapped and that's a horrible place to be.  Why not use some of the money you're earning from sugaring (or stripping if you switch to that) to get yourself trained for a career you like?  There's a  whole world out there.  If you're not sure what else you're good at, take one course in anything at the local community college.  That will give you access to their Career Counseling service.  They can give you some aptitude tests to figure out what good fields would be for you.  You may not make as much as a plumber or a computer specialist or any one of dozens of high-paying fields than as a SB, but you'll be a hell of a lot happier.  Once you're making enough money to be self-sufficient, then you can freely deicide if you want to do some sugaring to get the luxury goods like jewelry and trips and you can pick the men you want to provide things like that.",

Choices that you make when you're desperate aren't choices you have to stick to when you have more freedom & control.\n\nI'd never advocate sugaring (or any sex work) to anyone who dosn't enjoy it or isn't comfortable with it. You need to take some time to get some distance between what you had to do, and what you might in the future freely choose to do.\n\nIf you can afford to, take a few weeks or a month off from any sort of sex work (say, half of whatever length of time you can afford, so you've still got a cushion). Look after yourself, spend time with friends, have vanilla sex with guys you actually like. Don't throw the money away on luxuries (because knowing you have savings you can fall back on is important) but be comfortable and enjoy the time.\n\nThen, while you're off, take some time to consider whether you want to start sugaring - that you like the money is a no brainer! Are you going to enjoy it & be happy with yourself doing it? Not spending all the money you've got saved up is important - if you know you've got the money for 2 months food, rent, and bills then you aren't going to be under the pressure you were before. If you decide to come back to the bowl then do so when you've got the time to find guys who pay better and who you're comfortable with. If you do start sugaring then make sure you save as well as spend - once you've paid for any essentials (as a starting point) spend half the rest on making your life better (in whatever ways) and save the other half.\n\nSavings are important - they give you the freedom to change your mind.",

Most girls are doing extremely labour intensive and risky work for 3 figures an engagement.\n\nHang in there OP.  Engage in lots of self care.  This is a valid job, and treat it as such.

Most are looking to have a relationship with 1 man, that they have an emotional connection with and get financial assistance from. Most are not doing this as a career choice.

So it doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s one who wants a relationship with one, in fact it sounds like she doesn\u2019t want to have a relationship with any of them. Sugar babies are sex workers, so yes they do promote the sugar lifestyle in sex worker groups. She said she doesn\u2019t like sugaring, I have plenty of friends who didn\u2019t like sugaring but enjoy escorting. And not all escorts sleep with a dozen men a week, and a lot of emotional connections with their customers. You obviously have preconceived ideas of what escorts are that are entirely incorrect.

Working is difficult and stressful but at least it's easier to look at yourself in the mirror.

Guess what, you move in together and you save 1200 a month as a couple, or you get a bigger apartment for 1600 and only save 600 together. \n\nThe reason women don't find marriage partners is because they don't date men who are going to marry them. You spend your 20s on Tinder fucking guys that are fucking a bunch of other girls. If you went to the third best campus of a state school you need to be looking at plumbers and insurance claims adjusters, credit collectors, mechanics - and then you need to be OK living as a 60th percentile household income",

To do that, though, she needs to be able to stand on her own two feet.  I've always seen sugaring as a fun way to get some luxuries I couldn't otherwise afford.  If you need men's money, they have you trapped.  You sound like you're feeling terribly trapped and that's a horrible place to be.  Why not use some of the money you're earning from sugaring (or stripping if you switch to that) to get yourself trained for a career you like?  There's a  whole world out there.  If you're not sure what else you're good at, take one course in anything at the local community college.  That will give you access to their Career Counseling service.  They can give you some aptitude tests to figure out what good fields would be for you.  You may not make as much as a plumber or a computer specialist or any one of dozens of high-paying fields than as a SB, but you'll be a hell of a lot happier.  Once you're making enough money to be self-sufficient, then you can freely deicide if you want to do some sugaring to get the luxury goods like jewelry and trips and you can pick the men you want to provide things like that.",

As most of the \u201cSD\u201d on this sub have incorrect ideas of what escorts do.",

To do that, though, she needs to be able to stand on her own two feet.  I've always seen sugaring as a fun way to get some luxuries I couldn't otherwise afford.  If you need men's money, they have you trapped.  You sound like you're feeling terribly trapped and that's a horrible place to be.  Why not use some of the money you're earning from sugaring (or stripping if you switch to that) to get yourself trained for a career you like?  There's a  whole world out there.  If you're not sure what else you're good at, take one course in anything at the local community college.  That will give you access to their Career Counseling service.  They can give you some aptitude tests to figure out what good fields would be for you.  You may not make as much as a plumber or a computer specialist or any one of dozens of high-paying fields than as a SB, but you'll be a hell of a lot happier.  Once you're making enough money to be self-sufficient, then you can freely deicide if you want to do some sugaring to get the luxury goods like jewelry and trips and you can pick the men you want to provide things like that.",
