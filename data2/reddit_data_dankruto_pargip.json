The reason he picked that village was probably to figure out why they captured Rin though.\n\nhttps://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Yagura_Karatachi\n\nZabuza ended the practice by killing every one of the students to graduate before he even entered the academy.\n\nAlso Naruto pretty much matched Obito with the 10 tails.\n\nWhen did Kakashi master medical ninjutsu though?\n\nObito was also skilled at it since he transplanted Itachi's into Sasuke.",

It reminds me of the conversation he had with Tsunade when he healed her about change, and how the Sannin are fated rather ironically to never know what's going to happen next for them. Jiraiya is alive in this alternate world, and I feel like that's an indirect testament to the fact that Orochimaru is probably more ethical.",

That's why Kakashi said he couldn't let Rin get taken to the blood mist village and they made the students kill each other before Yagura's time. All I was saying was that Obito was smart for being able to do that.\n\nAnd Obito's goal wasn't to make the village peaceful. He took advantage of how they already were. The reason he picked that village was probably to figure out why they captured Rin though.\n\nhttps://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Yagura_Karatachi\n\nZabuza ended the practice by killing every one of the students to graduate before he even entered the academy.\n\nAlso Naruto pretty much matched Obito with the 10 tails.\n\nWhen did Kakashi master medical ninjutsu though?\n\nObito was also skilled at it since he transplanted Itachi's into Sasuke.",

It reminds me of the conversation he had with Tsunade when he healed her about change, and how the Sannin are fated rather ironically to never know what's going to happen next for them. Jiraiya is alive in this alternate world, and I feel like that's an indirect testament to the fact that Orochimaru is probably more ethical.",

That's why Kakashi said he couldn't let Rin get taken to the blood mist village and they made the students kill each other before Yagura's time. All I was saying was that Obito was smart for being able to do that.\n\nAnd Obito's goal wasn't to make the village peaceful. He took advantage of how they already were. The reason he picked that village was probably to figure out why they captured Rin though.\n\nhttps://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Yagura_Karatachi\n\nZabuza ended the practice by killing every one of the students to graduate before he even entered the academy.\n\nAlso Naruto pretty much matched Obito with the 10 tails.\n\nWhen did Kakashi master medical ninjutsu though?\n\nObito was also skilled at it since he transplanted Itachi's into Sasuke.",

It reminds me of the conversation he had with Tsunade when he healed her about change, and how the Sannin are fated rather ironically to never know what's going to happen next for them. Jiraiya is alive in this alternate world, and I feel like that's an indirect testament to the fact that Orochimaru is probably more ethical.",

That's why Kakashi said he couldn't let Rin get taken to the blood mist village and they made the students kill each other before Yagura's time. All I was saying was that Obito was smart for being able to do that.\n\nAnd Obito's goal wasn't to make the village peaceful. He took advantage of how they already were. The reason he picked that village was probably to figure out why they captured Rin though.\n\nhttps://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Yagura_Karatachi\n\nZabuza ended the practice by killing every one of the students to graduate before he even entered the academy.\n\nAlso Naruto pretty much matched Obito with the 10 tails.\n\nWhen did Kakashi master medical ninjutsu though?\n\nObito was also skilled at it since he transplanted Itachi's into Sasuke.",

Kakashi also mastered medical ninjistsu the moment he decided to put his mind to it.\n\nOutside from that if u look at his fights with obito in the war arc Kakashi is consistently outsmarting Obito yo make up for the power difference between them. If there was no power difference (Hashirama cells + rinnegan + MS is op) it wouldn't even be a fight",

The reason he picked that village was probably to figure out why they captured Rin though.\n\nhttps://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Yagura_Karatachi\n\nZabuza ended the practice by killing every one of the students to graduate before he even entered the academy.\n\nAlso Naruto pretty much matched Obito with the 10 tails.\n\nWhen did Kakashi master medical ninjutsu though?\n\nObito was also skilled at it since he transplanted Itachi's into Sasuke.",
