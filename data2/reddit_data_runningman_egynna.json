The comments I have seen are nice, saying she is pretty, adorable and funny. I tried to read comments under her videos from RM and Michuri in SBS catch or something. All the comments I read were nice some even had like 1.9k likes. \n\nBut she and RM took a gamble with this role. Actors go to a great extent to keep their image graceful and intact and what somin is doing is a reverse of that. I have seen some international comments suggesting that they can't take SM serious after watching RM. So this could affect how people view her in her acting roles but Korean sites I haven't read anything like that.",

He also chose to stick with RM only and then focusing on his acting career. You can correct me if I am wrong but KS got more attention from the acting industry recently right? I mean he has done good projects before but he is lead material on his own now. \n\nI think SM is also trying to do this but one thing that could work against her is time. Kwangsoo carved his way through like 9 years (?) SM even though she debuted before KS is almost like a recently discovered gem. \n\nI kinda think she can do roles like seo hyun jin's. WIsh to see her in a 16 ep hit drama. Her natural qualities shine through brightly in RomComs.",

Inseperable Bros. aside he was a supporting actor in other projects like Accidental Det. 2 or Tazza. He has ways to go to be a big lead on his own. But that might not be possible with RM in the way. He always has to work around its schedule, so he might miss out on movies cos of it.\n\nFor So Min I think she has like ~15 years to have a breakout show and establish herself. But maybe less than that. Actresses even over 40 will lose out on a lot of roles due to their age only...",

Inseperable Bros. aside he was a supporting actor in other projects like Accidental Det. 2 or Tazza. He has ways to go to be a big lead on his own. But that might not be possible with RM in the way. He always has to work around its schedule, so he might miss out on movies cos of it.\n\nFor So Min I think she has like ~15 years to have a breakout show and establish herself. But maybe less than that. Actresses even over 40 will lose out on a lot of roles due to their age only...",

All the comments I read were nice some even had like 1.9k likes. \n\nBut she and RM took a gamble with this role. Actors go to a great extent to keep their image graceful and intact and what somin is doing is a reverse of that. I have seen some international comments suggesting that they can't take SM serious after watching RM. So this could affect how people view her in her acting roles but Korean sites I haven't read anything like that.",
