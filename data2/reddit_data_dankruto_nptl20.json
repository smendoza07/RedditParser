Anyone who's not naruto/Sasuke/boruto/kawaki is completely out of their league and doesn't have much hope of doing *anything*. There have been a few moments for mitsuki/sarada, but definitely not enough. \n\n\nI was hoping that side characters could shine in the non combat moments at least but the latest chapter proved that it's still only about boruto and kawaki. Everyone else is not important.\n\n\n\nThe new villian they've introduced, without spoiling too much, can literally only be beaten by boruto and kawaki too. Like, its basically impossible for anyone else to beat them, even naruto and sasuke. \n\n\n\nNow I'm just ranting lol",

A prequel series about some characters like Minato, fugaku, white fang, etc would've been dope too.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen spending way more time on them post-war era would've been great. They could even cover the boruto era, but not making him the MC and trying to write a story around him. \n\n\n\n\nI don't even \"hate\" boruto as a character and a show individually.

Since his cells rapidly divide and multiply it shortens the length of his life and since he had to do that over and over again throughout his life due to constant battle and stress, it probably sped up his natural aging process (kinda like with what Tsunade has whenever she uses her 100 Seals). It was never really shown that he died from combat, but since he spoke to Madara about him possibly becoming the 2nd Hokage soon, he might\u2019ve known he was close to death or didn\u2019t have many more times he could regenerate",

Anyone who's not naruto/Sasuke/boruto/kawaki is completely out of their league and doesn't have much hope of doing *anything*. There have been a few moments for mitsuki/sarada, but definitely not enough. \n\n\nI was hoping that side characters could shine in the non combat moments at least but the latest chapter proved that it's still only about boruto and kawaki. Everyone else is not important.\n\n\n\nThe new villian they've introduced, without spoiling too much, can literally only be beaten by boruto and kawaki too. Like, its basically impossible for anyone else to beat them, even naruto and sasuke. \n\n\n\nNow I'm just ranting lol",

A prequel series about some characters like Minato, fugaku, white fang, etc would've been dope too.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen spending way more time on them post-war era would've been great. They could even cover the boruto era, but not making him the MC and trying to write a story around him. \n\n\n\n\nI don't even \"hate\" boruto as a character and a show individually. It's just a really bad sequel to naruto. Idk how else to say it lol",

Since his cells rapidly divide and multiply it shortens the length of his life and since he had to do that over and over again throughout his life due to constant battle and stress, it probably sped up his natural aging process (kinda like with what Tsunade has whenever she uses her 100 Seals). It was never really shown that he died from combat, but since he spoke to Madara about him possibly becoming the 2nd Hokage soon, he might\u2019ve known he was close to death or didn\u2019t have many more times he could regenerate",

Anyone who's not naruto/Sasuke/boruto/kawaki is completely out of their league and doesn't have much hope of doing *anything*. There have been a few moments for mitsuki/sarada, but definitely not enough. \n\n\nI was hoping that side characters could shine in the non combat moments at least but the latest chapter proved that it's still only about boruto and kawaki. Everyone else is not important.\n\n\n\nThe new villian they've introduced, without spoiling too much, can literally only be beaten by boruto and kawaki too. Like, its basically impossible for anyone else to beat them, even naruto and sasuke. \n\n\n\nNow I'm just ranting lol",

A prequel series about some characters like Minato, fugaku, white fang, etc would've been dope too.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen spending way more time on them post-war era would've been great. They could even cover the boruto era, but not making him the MC and trying to write a story around him. \n\n\n\n\nI don't even \"hate\" boruto as a character and a show individually. It's just a really bad sequel to naruto. Idk how else to say it lol",

Since his cells rapidly divide and multiply it shortens the length of his life and since he had to do that over and over again throughout his life due to constant battle and stress, it probably sped up his natural aging process (kinda like with what Tsunade has whenever she uses her 100 Seals). It was never really shown that he died from combat, but since he spoke to Madara about him possibly becoming the 2nd Hokage soon, he might\u2019ve known he was close to death or didn\u2019t have many more times he could regenerate",

Anyone who's not naruto/Sasuke/boruto/kawaki is completely out of their league and doesn't have much hope of doing *anything*. There have been a few moments for mitsuki/sarada, but definitely not enough. \n\n\nI was hoping that side characters could shine in the non combat moments at least but the latest chapter proved that it's still only about boruto and kawaki. Everyone else is not important.\n\n\n\nThe new villian they've introduced, without spoiling too much, can literally only be beaten by boruto and kawaki too. Like, its basically impossible for anyone else to beat them, even naruto and sasuke. \n\n\n\nNow I'm just ranting lol",

A prequel series about some characters like Minato, fugaku, white fang, etc would've been dope too.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen spending way more time on them post-war era would've been great. They could even cover the boruto era, but not making him the MC and trying to write a story around him. \n\n\n\n\nI don't even \"hate\" boruto as a character and a show individually. It's just a really bad sequel to naruto. Idk how else to say it lol",

They could even cover the boruto era, but not making him the MC and trying to write a story around him. \n\n\n\n\nI don't even \"hate\" boruto as a character and a show individually.

They could even cover the boruto era, but not making him the MC and trying to write a story around him. \n\n\n\n\nI don't even \"hate\" boruto as a character and a show individually.
