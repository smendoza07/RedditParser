    "body": "Ladies, I say this in a very nonjudgmental way, raise your standards. Have higher expectations for these men. Not every man is meant to be a SD, not every man has the means to but unfortunately they still try, and those are the majority of the men you\u2019ll meet in sugar dating. It\u2019s doing everyone a disservice, not only do you deserve better but it lowers the amount of effort they feel that they need to put in overall. If there\u2019s a girl that\u2019s going to accept the bare minimum, why would they do any better? This is all my personal opinion of course but these are the things he should be providing at a minimum.. \n\n\n1. He should cover your rent (at the very least).\n\n2. He should be buying you gifts, big or small, at least once a month. Bags, flowers, jewelry, vacations, or sending you to the nail salon. It doesn\u2019t always need to be pricey but it should be something. \n\n3. He should still cover your expenses if an emergency comes up and you can\u2019t see him for a week or two (obviously depending on how long you\u2019ve been seeing each other).\n\n4. He needs to respect your boundaries. If it\u2019s not something you want to do, he shouldn\u2019t push you. \n\n5. He should never bring you to a cheap hotel or expect you to welcome him into your apartment if you\u2019re not comfortable with it. \n\nThis is a sugar relationship, not a vanilla relationship. As SB\u2019s we put in a lot of effort to look good, be cheerful, make these men happy, and let\u2019s be honest it\u2019s a lot more work than a vanilla relationship and it\u2019s usually with someone that we wouldn\u2019t date normally. Don\u2019t forget that this is \u201cmutually beneficial,\u201d these men are gaining a lot from these relationships and you should be gaining something from them too.",

However, seeking lowered the barriers to entry such that any girl that can set up a profile thinks she has what it takes to be an SB, and any guy that can afford the one-ten monthly fee thinks he has what it takes to be an SD. \n\nAs such, if two people find each other on SA and agree to an arrangement that makes them both happy, even if it doesn't look like an arrangement I would be party too, who am I to judge?",

I can only speak from my personal experience but I was younger, prettier, and thinner when I first jumped into the bowl but I didn't make nearly as much or find the serious whales. I think that was because I didn't know how to navigate the bowl. I made a lot more (money, gifts, luxury vacations, etc...) when I figured out how to find the sugar and fend off the salt even though I had gained about 15lbs (wasn't fat or anything but not as thin as I had been) and I was in my late 20s at that point. Even now I've jumped back in the bowl and made quite a bit and have a few very promising potential SDs. So what I'm saying is that you don't have to be the most attractive, or the smartest to get the best daddies BUT you do need to know how to navigate the bowl. Figuring out how to make it work for you and also being decently attractive and intelligent, will go a long way in finding what you're looking for in sugar dating.",

I think as long as he's treating you well, the frivolous small gifts and such is nothing and if it matters to the SB, maybe she should ask instead of expecting him to do that. If he's working a high stress job, plus with kids and a wife, he's probably not thinking about doing the small minor things like getting a bag. (treating you well as in active listening, giving you orgasms, getting the PPM right, giving you a great experience, overall joy to be around) \n3. If this happens, which is unfortunate, I do feel like the SD should be last person you go to for help and not the first. As selfish as it sounds, they want to have fun with you and not be burdened with your life problems. You got to ask family and close friends before you start involving them into your emergency issues.\n4. Yes.\n5. Unless that's someone's kink or fantasy, this is valid.",

I can only speak from my personal experience but I was younger, prettier, and thinner when I first jumped into the bowl but I didn't make nearly as much or find the serious whales. I think that was because I didn't know how to navigate the bowl. I made a lot more (money, gifts, luxury vacations, etc...) when I figured out how to find the sugar and fend off the salt even though I had gained about 15lbs (wasn't fat or anything but not as thin as I had been) and I was in my late 20s at that point. Even now I've jumped back in the bowl and made quite a bit and have a few very promising potential SDs. So what I'm saying is that you don't have to be the most attractive, or the smartest to get the best daddies BUT you do need to know how to navigate the bowl. Figuring out how to make it work for you and also being decently attractive and intelligent, will go a long way in finding what you're looking for in sugar dating.",

At this point, the money is to get ahead, not stay afloat. \n\nI also look for more of an emotional and intellectual connection with no BS. If vanilla dating were like SR dating in that there isn\u2019t the drama, the games, etc, I\u2019d probably be married by now. Alas. \n\nI can compromise a bit on my financial ask if it means I\u2019m getting a quality person. A lot of SBs don\u2019t realize that the real good gains (like any investment) are in the long game. I don\u2019t need or even want to be spoiled (though it is a wonderful bonus); I want to be treated like a lady and enjoy his time and enjoy his intellect. \n\nThe money doesn\u2019t make a man any more attractive to me, it just gets him in the door. Even if he meets my financial ask, if he\u2019s rude the wait staff, chews with his mouth open, or talks down to me, I\u2019m out.",

I can only speak from my personal experience but I was younger, prettier, and thinner when I first jumped into the bowl but I didn't make nearly as much or find the serious whales. I think that was because I didn't know how to navigate the bowl. I made a lot more (money, gifts, luxury vacations, etc...) when I figured out how to find the sugar and fend off the salt even though I had gained about 15lbs (wasn't fat or anything but not as thin as I had been) and I was in my late 20s at that point. Even now I've jumped back in the bowl and made quite a bit and have a few very promising potential SDs. So what I'm saying is that you don't have to be the most attractive, or the smartest to get the best daddies BUT you do need to know how to navigate the bowl. Figuring out how to make it work for you and also being decently attractive and intelligent, will go a long way in finding what you're looking for in sugar dating.",
