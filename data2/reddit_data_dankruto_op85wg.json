Tobirama was more than generous to the Uchiha. He gave them jobs so [they can put their emotions into something positive](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtuDfCUXYAEKBsy?format=jpg&name=small) and be part of the village.

The Uchiha had *reason* as well, though I do confess that their eyes literally poisoning and darkening their chakra as they get stronger is a tad concerning. Hiruzen was a good man but an inactive politician, Minato might have been able to calm things down by being the charismatic gut that he was, but then he died.

It's just that the actions that needed to be taken to unfuck the situation were unbelievably drastic.\n\nKind of a big thing in *Naruto* is that everyone has a different point of view, and most people generally believe themselves justified in their actions for whatever reason.\n\nTobirama had *reason* to do what he did, given the life and times he experienced. The Uchiha had *reason* as well, though I do confess that their eyes literally poisoning and darkening their chakra as they get stronger is a tad concerning. Hiruzen was a good man but an inactive politician, Minato might have been able to calm things down by being the charismatic gut that he was, but then he died.

Then followed up by pointing out people generally resent law enforcement due to the fact they have to enforce even the things some people see as \u201cnot so bad\u201d. So corrupt or not, they were going to be disliked.\n\nI was mistaken about the outskirts but Danz\u014d only encouraged them to be moved even further, though they were already in a remote location in the first place.\n\nAs I mentioned, I like Tobirama as a character but he\u2019s not infallible and didn\u2019t wholly think this through for the long run which\u2026par for the course, i.e. Reanimation Jutsu (how could this possibly backfire on me?).",

It's just that the actions that needed to be taken to unfuck the situation were unbelievably drastic.\n\nKind of a big thing in *Naruto* is that everyone has a different point of view, and most people generally believe themselves justified in their actions for whatever reason.\n\nTobirama had *reason* to do what he did, given the life and times he experienced. The Uchiha had *reason* as well, though I do confess that their eyes literally poisoning and darkening their chakra as they get stronger is a tad concerning. Hiruzen was a good man but an inactive politician, Minato might have been able to calm things down by being the charismatic gut that he was, but then he died. The whole situation was a powder keg that had been lying hidden for a hundred years, waiting to blow.",

It's just that the actions that needed to be taken to unfuck the situation were unbelievably drastic.\n\nKind of a big thing in *Naruto* is that everyone has a different point of view, and most people generally believe themselves justified in their actions for whatever reason.\n\nTobirama had *reason* to do what he did, given the life and times he experienced. The Uchiha had *reason* as well, though I do confess that their eyes literally poisoning and darkening their chakra as they get stronger is a tad concerning. Hiruzen was a good man but an inactive politician, Minato might have been able to calm things down by being the charismatic gut that he was, but then he died. The whole situation was a powder keg that had been lying hidden for a hundred years, waiting to blow.",

The Uchiha had *reason* as well, though I do confess that their eyes literally poisoning and darkening their chakra as they get stronger is a tad concerning.
