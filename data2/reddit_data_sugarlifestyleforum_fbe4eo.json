    "body": "It's been almost two and a half years since I joined SLF as a contributing member. Looking back, I can remember both good times and not so good times. I remember when *Sugar Tinder* (TM) first became a thing. There were posts upon posts about using Tinder for sugar. (Maybe, eventually, I'll write about my one horrid experience trying *Sugar Tinder.)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can remember when the Master Allowance thread was first posted over two years ago and it devolved into people fighting with each other about lying. I remember looking at the wide range of numbers and thinking 'Wow! There is such diversity here!'\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can recall when Picture Thursday was resurected. I remember looking at all the photos of women on this forum and thinking, 'Everyone is so beautiful!'\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's a lot of things I can remember that I probably shouldn't. In the past two (plus) years there most likely isn't too many posts that I haven't given at least a cursory glance to. See, that's the thing about SLF (and Reddit in general), it can become quite addicting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy first M&G from SA was with a man that told me about SLF. Him and I never moved forward but he was the one that told me there was a subreddit about the Sugar Lifestyle. I remember racing home after that M&G (of which, at the time, I didn't actually know was called a Meet & Greet) and frantically searching for this sub. I read, without an account to post, for quite a few weeks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom the moment I found this sub I consumed every post I could find. I can recall comments and usernames from posts months if not years ago. It's a curse, really. When I meet friends from Reddit (either in person or to chat online) they will bring up a thought or comment they vaguely remember from a post, and I will be able to expound upon that thought or comment to what was said within the thread, and many times can recall the usernames of commenters as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would read this forum every chance I got. Standing in the line at the grocery store? I was browsing to see if someone commented on the most recent rinsing episode. In between calls at work? I was giving someone advice on how to spot a salt daddy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI sometimes joke with friends that I have a dossier on every long standing member in this forum. I don't have a photographic memory, though. It really just means I spend too much time on reddit. And too much emotional bandwidth. SLF is eating up all the RAM in my brain. And the thing about RAM? It's always limited.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOver the course of the last two years I've taken everyones stories and trials and successes and used them to shape some of my own actions. For the most part, and for many people, this is a good thing. SLF is a wealth of knowledge and information, bad jokes, the occasional meme, and the ever interesting debate about \\*Is Sugar Sex Work\\*? SLF is a guiding hand for those starting out, a forum for those looking to commiserate over the ever increasing sea of salty daddies and rinsing babies, and a place for a group of outsiders to feel at home in a lifestyle that isn't yet mainstream.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've always joked that I'm the worst sugar baby in the world. And maybe that's partially true. Because for all the knowledge I've gained from SLF I don't tend to act like your usual sugar baby. It's fairly common knowledge that I date a Redditor. When we first started talking he once said to me: 'You're not like the other girls.' And when I asked him what that meant, he replied 'You know, complimenting me and stuff.'\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe thing about SLF, is there's good advice for people starting out in this lifestyle, or people just getting back into it. There's tried and true methods to find a SD or SB, and there's a great deal of posts about the pitfalls of sugar dating. But over the course of two years, I've read post after post on the same subjects, over and over. And after two years, It's very rare that I read something new, something that makes me think - 'Wow! Now that's a new concept!' For every sensible post there is a hundred rising to the top about \\[insert cliche allowance/sex/M&G issue\\]. And eventually, all that negativity begins to wear you down. Even the best of us got worn down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI went on a date with my guy recently. It was one of those really quick nice-to-see-you meet ups that we try to schedule in between regular dates. I'd had a bad day and I was extra anxious about quite a few things going on in my life, but I was happy to see him. My guy asked me if I wanted to have some release to help ease the anxiety (and you adults know which kind I'm talking about). He wasn't asking for sex. He was asking ME if I wanted some good one sided oral stimulation. And for some strange reason, I was unable to articulate the word 'no'. I didn't feel like being touched, but all that kept going through my head was, 'an SB does things she sometimes doesn't want to do. She acts happy, even when she's not.'\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut that's not me. That's never been me. I've never acted like your normal sugar baby, but for some reason that day, my brain shut down and I didn't say what I felt. I didn't do the thing that made my guy choose me over the countless other SB's that throw themselves at guys: *Be myself.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA fight ensued. One that included comments about consent and voicing feelings, and how anxiety affects the female body. It was the closest I think we've ever come to breaking up in the seven months we've known each other. Thankfully, my guy picked up on my body cues, and we never actually went down the whole road of 'was it really consented?' - but I'd prefer to not ever come close to that cliff again. And so, due to this interaction (and a few before it), I decided to take a break from SLF and find myself again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOver the course of the past two weeks, and the few leading up to that in which I was slowly extricating myself from this forum, I've felt like a freer, lighter version of me. I don't give a flying squirrel whether my guy side-eyes me choosing a wine and cheese place for dinner when he's vegan, because prior, if you'd asked SLF the answer would be that I should do what he wants. And even farther back, when we first met, my guy told me he'd happily be in an arrangement with me without sex. That being around me was enough. But if you'd asked SLF, the forum would've told him he was crazy. *Platonic relationships don't exist.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've found I communicate better now than I did a few weeks ago when all this information was swirling around in my head. I am less likely to analyze a question my guy poses and more likely to give him an answer that is not tainted by SLF guidelines. *What? No, I don't plan on giving you a blowjob in the parking lot of Target. Don't be a neanderthal.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've seen countless good users come and go over my time here. People have stopped posting and I always wondered why that was. Well, now I know. They just got tired of all the noise. They found themselves a good guy, or girl, and they left this forum because they outgrew it. They didn't need their hands held any longer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, here's my unsolicited advice SLF. Read this forum when you can. Utilize it's strengths to go on M&G's, employ the tips to filter out salty daddies and rinsing babies. Protect yourself with the experiences of those before you. Use this forum to assist in finding and nailing down a good partner. **And then forget everything you ever learned.** Treat your partner like a human being with thoughts and feelings and worries just like your own. Flip the bird to anyone who tells you to do otherwise. And, for the love of all things holy, *just be yourself.*",

We are human beings and hence subject to some inconsistency.\n\nTake a good example of a new SB asking for advance. The general agreement here would be a big red flag and next her. I had given the same advise recently.\n\nThen life took a turn on its own and my new SB asked me for advance on her many X ppm for an emergency.  What did i do? \n\nI reached deep inside myself and questioned my own humanity. In the end, I gave it to her.\n\nThe funny bit is that after i made the transfer, somebody on this forum commented on my post a few hours ago about \"not giving new SB advance on PPM\".\n\nLuckily for me and the SB, we are still going strong.\n\nI will still give advise on \"not giving advance PPM\" for new SB. However, horses for courses. We are human after all and it is a relationship in the end.\n\n\"Go forth and prosper\".",

The rules were helpful to me in the beginning, but by being too rigid and enforcing PPM before allowance, be ready to get physical on date #2, don't ask for anything on M&G, etc... I realized I was adhering to a dogmatic set of recommendations that are wildly in favor of SDs and actually misrepresented me and the kind of relationship I really wanted. I started playing by my own set of rules that are completely contrary to a lot of recommendations listed here and it has made my relationships so much more humane, light, and successful. I do appreciate having found this forum, as a lot of posts about negative experiences and expectations and debates about how to go about certain delicate subjects has been invaluable... but I tend to disagree pretty heavily with the set of rules in the courtship phase, and it's worked out very well for me.",

Hell, my SD is an amazing guy, a total gentleman, and my first time meeting him I went to his hotel room, and he never wanted sex that first day, just someone to spend time with around the city. It was lovely. Most people would say that is an absolute no-no, but I went with my gut after good conversation and vetting and I\u2019m happy I did. I wouldn\u2019t tell others to do the same, I want everyone to be safe, but I want everyone to just enjoy themselves and remember that everything isn\u2019t so black and white or yes and no. Stay safe, listen to your gut and HAVE FUN with the lifestyle! That\u2019s all I try to do now.",
