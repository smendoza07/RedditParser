    "body": "So after my last post I got a message on here from a guy claiming to be looking for an arrangement..saying he doesn\u2019t use SA anymore due to the low quality (clearly he can\u2019t afford to pay the fee lol) anyway he asked what i\u2019m looking for and I told him, he then accused me of being \u201cunreasonable and too high\u201d. It\u2019s fine if i\u2019m out of your budget, but you do not get to tell me I am unreasonable just because you can\u2019t afford me. Do you go into a shoe shop and tell them their prices are unreasonable and too high? No you just leave because you don\u2019t want to look cheap, yet when it comes to actual humans you have no problem paying us less respect than items in a shop and trying to tell us what our access to our bodies and time are worth, the answer is what ever the hell we decide, not what you can or can\u2019t afford. Next time you can\u2019t afford a SB\u2019s desired allowance just say  \u201csorry I can\u2019t afford that\u201d instead of insulting her. Nothing makes you look saltier than insulting a woman cause she\u2019s out of your budget. Remember, a SB is a luxury not an entitlement, it\u2019s not her job to lower her standards so you can afford her, it\u2019s your job to work harder to afford life\u2019s luxuries.",

I never thought of this forum as a potential source, but I have reached out to one or two potentials when they have posted for a review or asking a question.  If things dont work out for whatever reason, I always keep the interaction positive because you never know and its the polite thing to do.\n\nYou offer good advice and consider it a positive that you have dodged a bullet.",

This isn't a normal retail shoe shop.  In lots of private sales or services contracts, it's perfectly fine for the buyer to ask if the price could be improved, e.g., how about if I bought all 3 pairs of shoes, could you offer a discounted price per pair?; how much would it cost if you did the construction and I handled the painting?
