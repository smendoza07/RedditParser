    "body": "Pack it in boys. The sb I met today is literally blind. She shows up with a walking cane and everything. The hotel staff helped her find me at the bar. I was shocked, cuz she didn't tell me, but damn. She looks like barbie. Straight up blind girl in a lbd, about 10,000% more high fashion than my seeing ass. So I tell her I look like Chris Helmsworth, and she says \"what's a Chris helmsworth?\"  I burst into tears of joy, and you know what? She has no idea, cuz she can't see me!  I could pick my fucking nose if I wanted to.  I ordered my strawberry gimlet, and was like \"yeah, I'm pounding some whiskey neats here.\"  She made me feel like such a man. Turns out, my jokes are even funnier when you have no idea how ugly I am. We talk for hours and she calls me \"handsome\" which even my mom knows isn't true but damn, I'm happy a blind girl says so. She says something like this she \"never saw coming.\"  Awe come on. Dad jokes? Yeah, straight up came in my pants. Sorry to all you gentlemen out there, but you all are in second place, because my awesome skills of having dumb luck found me a 10/10 (8/7 in metric).",
