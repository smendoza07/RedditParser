    "body": "Mutual respect is import in any relationship, but because of the typical age, power and attraction gap within a Sugar Relationship, mutual respect is even more important.  \n\nOlder, wealthier SDs can be very dismissive, controlling and demanding of a younger woman that they are supporting financially.  They may feel their life experience supersedes any view point she may have and that their financial support has bought them the right to tell them what to do.\n\nYoung, beautiful SBs often have been put on a pedestal all their life and feel that their SD is fortunate to have her in his presence.   She may have been given \"pretty privilege\" which allowed her to be arrogant, act badly and get away with it.   She may not feel she needs to be respectful of her SD.\n\nWays to show respect:\n\n* Value the other persons viewpoint\n* Respect the other persons time\n* Communicate clearly...don't make assumptions\n* Do what you say you will do\n* Seek first to understand before being understood...genuinely listen\n* Give advice only when asked for your advice\n* Acknowledge your mistakes, apologize and make amends\n* Don't treat an SD like an ATM\n* Don't treat an SB like a sex toy\n* Be courteous and polite with all servers, clerks, etc.\n\nConfidence is a very attractive characteristic, but the difference between confidence and arrogance is respect for others.  Nothing is more unattractive than arrogance and arrogance is thinking that you are better than someone else for whatever reason (wealth, looks, intelligence, athleticism, etc.) and that you do not need to respect the other person because you are better.\n\nNothing turns me off faster than disrespect.  I don't care how beautiful a woman may be, but the first sign of arrogance and disrespect, I'm done.",

What these SD's fail to realize is that mature women value respect over anything. We've been around this block before. We know there's a code of ethics in the bowl. We know how pertinent trust and communication are. Yet, we continue to be passed up for the under 25 crowd.",

If a mild form of disrespect (constantly looking at their Cell Phone when with you) call them out on it and why you find that behavior disrespectful.\n2. If more disrespectful like agreeing to a meetup and not showing on time...  A more firm mention that if it happens again no more SR.\n3. Third strike and she is out.  Disrespect is that serious an offense.",
