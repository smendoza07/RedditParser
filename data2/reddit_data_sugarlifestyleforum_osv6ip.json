    "body": "So I see a lot of SB\u2019s on here questioning what they should/shouldn\u2019t put up with, being afraid to bring up allowance and honestly just having their time wasted by men who just want to stick a carrot in front of your face and lead you on. \n\nListen, you need to have high standards, a lot of self love, and self respect before dealing with men in general. Inside and outside the bowl. Ladies, you are pretty enough, smart enough, worthy enough. To help you with your confidence and finding your voice, I would recommend following bymichellediaz on IG and tik tok. She teaches women all about self worth so you can go back time and time again until this mindset sticks. Good luck ladies.",

The SD pays and the SB does what he wants her to do.\n\nNot at all what I said. If SB and SD both want to do similar things and agree on them, over time a bond is created and sometimes but rarely, marriages. Mutually agreed things. You wanna try something new? Cool, SB probs does too - interesting and exciting. SB wants to learn about how to pair wine with food? Cool, SD probs does too, wines an elegant art. \n\nPartnership is very much a biz word.

SD gets satisfaction, enjoyable company to do whatever with - be it golfing or going to a aquarium or hopping on a boat or jetski. SB gets financial & layers of the above, sometimes gifts. SB sometimes also gives gifts to SD. \n\nIts mutually beneficial. \n\nPartnership is a biz word, we're not trying to do business with you and you're not trying to do business with us generally. There's the outliers in every situation and thats about 2% of the time.",

What I was getting at, is that if you walked up to a female boss you worked for and said \"hey, I'm only here to look at your boobs and potentially sx\" you'd likely get a slap and have to talk to HR + lose job. Damaged reputation. I can't speak for all SBs but I've rather enjoyed my arrangements excluding a very short lived one. \n\n>\nBut you're saying it's not mutually beneficial it's subservient. The SD pays and the SB does what he wants her to do.\n\nNot at all what I said. If SB and SD both want to do similar things and agree on them, over time a bond is created and sometimes but rarely, marriages. Mutually agreed things. You wanna try something new? Cool, SB probs does too - interesting and exciting. SB wants to learn about how to pair wine with food? Cool, SD probs does too, wines an elegant art. \n\nPartnership is very much a biz word. In what token would anyone say \"I'm in a partnership with my SD\" ... partnership is between 2 or more owners/founders etc in business.",

Raw fish within numerous cultures - I was super hesitant to try these types of things but after some discussion and trialling diff types, I actually like it. I personally enjoy being stretched and finding new things though, even if it means a *you gotta try it, you'll enjoy it I'm sure and if not, we can go elsewhere* - this makes me super happy. Sometimes SD will pick a place and surprise me or pick a meal at random  ... one SD I had, he'd roll the dice on what he ate and I'd roll too. \n\nYes but marriages are generally called marriages or life partners. I certainly wouldn't refer to a bf/gf as having a partnership... its 2 lives that are intertwined. Idk why you'd call SD & SB a partnership... its an agreement of sorts.",

Damaged reputation. I can't speak for all SBs but I've rather enjoyed my arrangements excluding a very short lived one. \n\n>\nBut you're saying it's not mutually beneficial it's subservient. The SD pays and the SB does what he wants her to do.\n\nNot at all what I said. If SB and SD both want to do similar things and agree on them, over time a bond is created and sometimes but rarely, marriages. Mutually agreed things. You wanna try something new? Cool, SB probs does too - interesting and exciting. SB wants to learn about how to pair wine with food? Cool, SD probs does too, wines an elegant art. \n\nPartnership is very much a biz word. In what token would anyone say \"I'm in a partnership with my SD\" ... partnership is between 2 or more owners/founders etc in business.",

Raw fish within numerous cultures - I was super hesitant to try these types of things but after some discussion and trialling diff types, I actually like it. I personally enjoy being stretched and finding new things though, even if it means a *you gotta try it, you'll enjoy it I'm sure and if not, we can go elsewhere* - this makes me super happy. Sometimes SD will pick a place and surprise me or pick a meal at random  ... one SD I had, he'd roll the dice on what he ate and I'd roll too. \n\nYes but marriages are generally called marriages or life partners. I certainly wouldn't refer to a bf/gf as having a partnership... its 2 lives that are intertwined. Idk why you'd call SD & SB a partnership... its an agreement of sorts.",

I personally enjoy being stretched and finding new things though, even if it means a *you gotta try it, you'll enjoy it I'm sure and if not, we can go elsewhere* - this makes me super happy.

I like the smell of red wines but they never settle well in my stomach for some reason but I'll almost always try a sip or two; still trying to find a red wine that sits well on my stomach. Raw fish within numerous cultures - I was super hesitant to try these types of things but after some discussion and trialling diff types, I actually like it. I personally enjoy being stretched and finding new things though, even if it means a *you gotta try it, you'll enjoy it I'm sure and if not, we can go elsewhere* - this makes me super happy. Sometimes SD will pick a place and surprise me or pick a meal at random  ... one SD I had, he'd roll the dice on what he ate and I'd roll too. \n\nYes but marriages are generally called marriages or life partners. I certainly wouldn't refer to a bf/gf as having a partnership... its 2 lives that are intertwined. Idk why you'd call SD & SB a partnership... its an agreement of sorts.",
