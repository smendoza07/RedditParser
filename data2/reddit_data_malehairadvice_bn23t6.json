They all have very thick and wavy hair and yours is pretty straight and you don\u2019t have a ton of volume. \n\nYeah, clay and sea salt spray with a blow dryer might get you close, but that\u2019s a long process every day if you have done it before. Plus it won\u2019t stay like it does and will fall down/straighten out/revert to your normal hair within a few hours. \n\nYou would be much better looking at haircuts where the models have a similar type of hair and it will end up looking better, too.",
