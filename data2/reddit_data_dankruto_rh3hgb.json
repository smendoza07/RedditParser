Real-life stigma is founded on people fearing others who are different because of x condition that is out of their control even though treating them like shit for x condition makes it worse. It's not logical, but human emotions have been shown time and time again to circumvent all logic. We have people who hate other people simply because their skin color is different.\n\nSame goes for Konoha's hate boner for Naruto simply because he had a Tailed Beast in him, even though he had no agency in getting one. They fear and hate him because the beast within him killed their families even though treating him like shit increases the probability of the Tailed Beast killing their new families.\n\nThis is, as Pain put it, a cycle of hatred.",

I remember reading a post here a year or so ago, about how it would've been better if some of the comically evil things he did was spread out to other influential characters with power- like the Hokage or the council etc, because that would've been far more realistic and would show just how awful politics could be in such situations. Instead pretty much every mystery with a high body count in Konoha was attributed to Danzo, which sometimes doesn't really make sense once you pour over the details. I kind of agree with that now.",

And they didn't have an army surrounding Naruto at all times but they could have. Honestly it would have been so easy for the cloud to kidnap him like they tried with Kushina and Hinata.\n\nHashirama's goal for the village was to get clans to live together peacefully. The village is essentially one big clan so the same applies.\n\nbtw since Sasuke had no more clan members, someone else should have been taking care of him since he was like 8. That probably would have made him not want to kill everyone in the village too, but no, they let him stay isolated.\n\nHiruzen literally could have ordered someone or 2 someones to raise him. At the very least Kakashi should have been in his life before he managed to make clones to pass the exam.\n\nIf not for Danzo, Koharu, and Homura he may have asked Mikoto and Fugaku to raise him since they were friends of Minato and Kushina as well.",

In fact, I'd go so far as to say EVERY single manga author who's had a series go for more than 200-300 chapters has done so. This isn't new. Almost anybody you consider one of the greatest manga authors, if he/she wrote a series that long or longer has done it plenty. So honestly idfk why only Kishi seems to get flack for it. Naruto is 700 fucking chapters long!!! One Piece is a few hundred chapters longer than that but begins to show blatant signs of certain things being cobbled together fairly early on. It was originally only planned to last like 5 years, and it shows. Yet people don't shit on Oda for this. \n\nSo long as something works in context, why do you feel it's necessary to criticize for being drawn up as he went along? It's not \"stupid writing\" that the Hokage would want to have his child in secrecy, especially in such a tense, War-stricken era.",

They\u2019re extremely lucky that Naruto is such a kind, forgiving and generous person, otherwise the whole village would\u2019ve been destroyed for good altogether really quickly. \n\nPlus, with how deeply absorbed in their prejudices they are, the idea that there could be any resemblance between Naruto and a beloved figure of Konoha would not even enter their tiny brain. \n\nTreating any child in such a way makes one a piece of garbage, and if you add the context here, it makes one a very stupid piece of garbage. \n\nIt really seems like idiocy and ignorance is widespread in Konoha.",

First they just treated Naruto as shit just as an outlet for their angry from the Nine Tails attack.\n\nSecond, Naruto was looked at as a untalented brat who pulled childish pranks all the time. It would probably be considered offensive to even suggest that he could be Minato\u2019s kid.\n\nThird, Hiruzen mentions in Episode 1 (or 2) that Minato wanted the jinchuriki of the Nine tails to be seen as a hero for technically being the one to save the village. But the villagers don\u2019t care, they literally think he\u2019s the Nine Tails incarnate",

Not to mention that Madara did not successfully attack the village. The kyuubi attack all those years ago had no effect on the village in terms of damages and the only casualties were the few ninja that met Madara at the border and attempted to stop him before Hashirama showed up. Given how extremely small the effects were, I imagine they have been completely mitigated and forgotten 70 years later.",

I remember reading a post here a year or so ago, about how it would've been better if some of the comically evil things he did was spread out to other influential characters with power- like the Hokage or the council etc, because that would've been far more realistic and would show just how awful politics could be in such situations. Instead pretty much every mystery with a high body count in Konoha was attributed to Danzo, which sometimes doesn't really make sense once you pour over the details. I kind of agree with that now.",

If there were other Uzumakis we should have seen them once Naruto was Hokage.\n\nAnd it doesn't freaking matter. Not taking care of one of your clan members is a dereliction of duty. And they didn't have an army surrounding Naruto at all times but they could have. Honestly it would have been so easy for the cloud to kidnap him like they tried with Kushina and Hinata.\n\nHashirama's goal for the village was to get clans to live together peacefully. The village is essentially one big clan so the same applies.\n\nbtw since Sasuke had no more clan members, someone else should have been taking care of him since he was like 8. That probably would have made him not want to kill everyone in the village too, but no, they let him stay isolated.\n\nHiruzen literally could have ordered someone or 2 someones to raise him. At the very least Kakashi should have been in his life before he managed to make clones to pass the exam.\n\nIf not for Danzo, Koharu, and Homura he may have asked Mikoto and Fugaku to raise him since they were friends of Minato and Kushina as well.",

If he couldn't be trusted to take care of Naruto then he certainly can't be trusted to go on missions and Hiruzen failed even more colossally than anyone has said.\n\nBy not making sure he had z full time parent or parentss they almost ended up with him becoming like Gaara or leaving the village possibly the nation.

Almost anybody you consider one of the greatest manga authors, if he/she wrote a series that long or longer has done it plenty. So honestly idfk why only Kishi seems to get flack for it. Naruto is 700 fucking chapters long!!! One Piece is a few hundred chapters longer than that but begins to show blatant signs of certain things being cobbled together fairly early on. It was originally only planned to last like 5 years, and it shows. Yet people don't shit on Oda for this. \n\nSo long as something works in context, why do you feel it's necessary to criticize for being drawn up as he went along? It's not \"stupid writing\" that the Hokage would want to have his child in secrecy, especially in such a tense, War-stricken era.",

We have people who hate other people simply because their skin color is different.\n\nSame goes for Konoha's hate boner for Naruto simply because he had a Tailed Beast in him, even though he had no agency in getting one.

I remember reading a post here a year or so ago, about how it would've been better if some of the comically evil things he did was spread out to other influential characters with power- like the Hokage or the council etc, because that would've been far more realistic and would show just how awful politics could be in such situations. Instead pretty much every mystery with a high body count in Konoha was attributed to Danzo, which sometimes doesn't really make sense once you pour over the details. I kind of agree with that now.",

Like Sasuke's love for Sakura coming out of nowhere there.\n\nRoot has a pill that gives people the equivalent of several released gates worth of strength in the Saukra novel. Supposedly on par with death gate Guy...\n\nItachi left a shadow clone in the academy while he went out with Shisui. Which doesn't sound so bad until you realise he was there for a YEAR and graduated at 7. Shadow clone, all day, at 7...  \nAnd before that, he saved his JONIN mother when he was like 5.\n\nNovels are officially published fanfictions of canon. They're literally just stories written by various people based on the Narutoverse with Kishimoto's only involvement being illustrations for the book covers.",

If there were other Uzumakis we should have seen them once Naruto was Hokage.\n\nAnd it doesn't freaking matter. Not taking care of one of your clan members is a dereliction of duty. And they didn't have an army surrounding Naruto at all times but they could have. Honestly it would have been so easy for the cloud to kidnap him like they tried with Kushina and Hinata.\n\nHashirama's goal for the village was to get clans to live together peacefully. The village is essentially one big clan so the same applies.\n\nbtw since Sasuke had no more clan members, someone else should have been taking care of him since he was like 8. That probably would have made him not want to kill everyone in the village too, but no, they let him stay isolated.\n\nHiruzen literally could have ordered someone or 2 someones to raise him. At the very least Kakashi should have been in his life before he managed to make clones to pass the exam.\n\nIf not for Danzo, Koharu, and Homura he may have asked Mikoto and Fugaku to raise him since they were friends of Minato and Kushina as well.",

If he couldn't be trusted to take care of Naruto then he certainly can't be trusted to go on missions and Hiruzen failed even more colossally than anyone has said.\n\nBy not making sure he had z full time parent or parentss they almost ended up with him becoming like Gaara or leaving the village possibly the nation.

So honestly idfk why only Kishi seems to get flack for it. Naruto is 700 fucking chapters long!!! One Piece is a few hundred chapters longer than that but begins to show blatant signs of certain things being cobbled together fairly early on. It was originally only planned to last like 5 years, and it shows. Yet people don't shit on Oda for this. \n\nSo long as something works in context, why do you feel it's necessary to criticize for being drawn up as he went along? It's not \"stupid writing\" that the Hokage would want to have his child in secrecy, especially in such a tense, War-stricken era.",

I remember reading a post here a year or so ago, about how it would've been better if some of the comically evil things he did was spread out to other influential characters with power- like the Hokage or the council etc, because that would've been far more realistic and would show just how awful politics could be in such situations. Instead pretty much every mystery with a high body count in Konoha was attributed to Danzo, which sometimes doesn't really make sense once you pour over the details. I kind of agree with that now.",

Which doesn't sound so bad until you realise he was there for a YEAR and graduated at 7. Shadow clone, all day, at 7...  \nAnd before that, he saved his JONIN mother when he was like 5.\n\nNovels are officially published fanfictions of canon.

And they didn't have an army surrounding Naruto at all times but they could have. Honestly it would have been so easy for the cloud to kidnap him like they tried with Kushina and Hinata.\n\nHashirama's goal for the village was to get clans to live together peacefully. The village is essentially one big clan so the same applies.\n\nbtw since Sasuke had no more clan members, someone else should have been taking care of him since he was like 8. That probably would have made him not want to kill everyone in the village too, but no, they let him stay isolated.\n\nHiruzen literally could have ordered someone or 2 someones to raise him. At the very least Kakashi should have been in his life before he managed to make clones to pass the exam.\n\nIf not for Danzo, Koharu, and Homura he may have asked Mikoto and Fugaku to raise him since they were friends of Minato and Kushina as well.",

If he couldn't be trusted to take care of Naruto then he certainly can't be trusted to go on missions and Hiruzen failed even more colossally than anyone has said.\n\nBy not making sure he had z full time parent or parentss they almost ended up with him becoming like Gaara or leaving the village possibly the nation.

An Uzumaki orphan appearing out of nowhere probably wasn't too outside of the normal for the village at the time. And when it happens, they probably didn't ask too many questions. Coupled with the fact he's the Nine Tails Jinchuriki, they probably just wanted to ignore his existence and got annoyed when he won't let them forget he exists with all of his attention seeking.",

Instead pretty much every mystery with a high body count in Konoha was attributed to Danzo, which sometimes doesn't really make sense once you pour over the details. I kind of agree with that now.",

Shadow clone, all day, at 7...  \nAnd before that, he saved his JONIN mother when he was like 5.\n\nNovels are officially published fanfictions of canon. They're literally just stories written by various people based on the Narutoverse with Kishimoto's only involvement being illustrations for the book covers.",

And they didn't have an army surrounding Naruto at all times but they could have. Honestly it would have been so easy for the cloud to kidnap him like they tried with Kushina and Hinata.\n\nHashirama's goal for the village was to get clans to live together peacefully. The village is essentially one big clan so the same applies.\n\nbtw since Sasuke had no more clan members, someone else should have been taking care of him since he was like 8. That probably would have made him not want to kill everyone in the village too, but no, they let him stay isolated.\n\nHiruzen literally could have ordered someone or 2 someones to raise him. At the very least Kakashi should have been in his life before he managed to make clones to pass the exam.\n\nIf not for Danzo, Koharu, and Homura he may have asked Mikoto and Fugaku to raise him since they were friends of Minato and Kushina as well.",

If he couldn't be trusted to take care of Naruto then he certainly can't be trusted to go on missions and Hiruzen failed even more colossally than anyone has said.\n\nBy not making sure he had z full time parent or parentss they almost ended up with him becoming like Gaara or leaving the village possibly the nation.

Instead pretty much every mystery with a high body count in Konoha was attributed to Danzo, which sometimes doesn't really make sense once you pour over the details. I kind of agree with that now.",

Honestly it would have been so easy for the cloud to kidnap him like they tried with Kushina and Hinata.\n\nHashirama's goal for the village was to get clans to live together peacefully. The village is essentially one big clan so the same applies.\n\nbtw since Sasuke had no more clan members, someone else should have been taking care of him since he was like 8. That probably would have made him not want to kill everyone in the village too, but no, they let him stay isolated.\n\nHiruzen literally could have ordered someone or 2 someones to raise him. At the very least Kakashi should have been in his life before he managed to make clones to pass the exam.\n\nIf not for Danzo, Koharu, and Homura he may have asked Mikoto and Fugaku to raise him since they were friends of Minato and Kushina as well.",

If he couldn't be trusted to take care of Naruto then he certainly can't be trusted to go on missions and Hiruzen failed even more colossally than anyone has said.\n\nBy not making sure he had z full time parent or parentss they almost ended up with him becoming like Gaara or leaving the village possibly the nation.
