However there is definitely a learning curve transitioning from straight to wavy/curly hair imo. I found styling straight hair into whatever I wanted (mid part, quiff, bangs, combover, etc) to be pretty easy once you learn how to use products and a blowdryer. With curlier hair I tend to be more cautious with how I approach my hair to make sure it doesn't end up frizzy or flat/in a weird shape. I also miss being able to run my hands through my hair without it snagging/getting ruined but that really just depends on how tight of a perm you get. Just thought I'd share my experience.",

My straight hair required a lot of time and effort to style good. \n\nWhen I straight hair, I used to blow dry, shape it correctly and use wax. Also, it would lose the meticulous shape if it\u2019s windy, raining, or if I sweat.\n\nNow I just blow dry once in the morning and nothing affects its shape throughout the day. \n\nI also think tighter curls might be different, though.",
