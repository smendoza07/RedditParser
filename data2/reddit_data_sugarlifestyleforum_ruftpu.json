    "body": "MThere's a lot of discussion about what someone wants a sugar relationship to be like, or what they want to experience.   From the opposite perspective, what are you bringing to your sugar partner?  Here's my version -- I don't claim it's right or wrong, just the way I want my SB to feel in an SR once we're past the short-term, building-trust phase.  I like connected, strings-attached SRs.  This is a partial list!\n\n* **My SB should feel a little pampered.**  Outside of allowance, covering little things like mani/pedis, little shopping trips, all the way to more luxury shopping, travel, etc.\n* **My SB should feel like she's having experiences she otherwise wouldn't**.  Self explanatory.\n* **My SB should feel like she's got a bit of a safety net** she otherwise wouldn't have.  She's got a perfect storm of her student loan, car insurance, rent, health insurance premium, big car repair bill, and some other things, all converging this month?  No worries -- I've got her.  It shouldn't be often, and it shouldn't be the result of recklessness.  Otherwise, no, no SB of mine is going to miss her rent payment or not have health insurance.\n* **My SB should feel like she's got access to a level of people she otherwise wouldn't**.  Me, of course -- I'm a successful executive with some knowledge about life that a 24 year old normally wouldn't have access to.  If we get close, chances are she'll meet my friends, who at this point are a diverse group of very successful people, and knowing she's my SB, are extremely willing to give her advice or perspectives, in one case one managed to hook up my SB as an intern with someone in his network, etc.\n* **My SB should feel like I genuinely care about her, beyond the structured agreement** in the sugar relationship.  Forget sex and allowance, she should feel like I'm on her side.  One measure of this is how often there's still a relationship even after the SR ends.\n* **My SB should feel like her sexual satisfaction is important to me**.  I'll leave it up to her to decide whether I'm successful \ud83e\udd23\n* **My SB should feel like she can be herself, warts and all**, rather than have to be \"on\"\n* **My SB should feel listened to, respected, and appreciated**.  Whether it's where we should go on vacation, or her comfort level about how we interact and what she needs to feel safe and happy.\n* **My SB should be able to tell I put in effort to romance her, to look good for her**\n* **My SB should feel rock solid secure that I'll do the things I say I'll do**.\n\nI will point out three important things:\n\n1. Sometimes people ask \"what's the difference between a sugar relationship and X?\"   We all know what X usually is, but X can be anything -- vanilla relationship, lawyer, auto mechanic, whatever.  If it's important to you that your auto mechanic feel like what I described above.... well then yes, I suppose auto maintenance IS just like sugar.  If your auto mechanic feels like you are genuinely on their side in life, you're providing pampering beyond anything you've agreed to, you're their safety net if they get in a financial bind, their sexual satisfaction is important to you, you're so connected that the personal relationship might continue even after you're not taking your car there anymore -- then yes, auto maintenance is just like sugar.  Otherwise, it's nothing like sugar.  Replace auto mechanic with any other profession you'd like to compare sugar to, same result :)\n2. I didn't mention PPM vs allowance because it doesn't matter.  Typically, I'm building an SR like what I describe above while we're still on PPM, and then there's a transition to allowance.  Allowance vs PPM is more of a footnote than the driver of what the SR feels like.\n3. Obviously, I expect SRs to be balanced in what they bring to both of us.  I expect to be experiencing awesomeness on the same level as above, from her.\n\nFor you for a moment -- what is it you want your SD or SB to feel like, when in an SR with you, in the longer term (obviously, first few days, weeks, or even months, this is something we're building towards, it's not day 1)?",

            "body": "This feels SOOOO familiar to me.  With the exception of the meeting friends part.  We don\u2019t do that.  \n\nThought it might be useful to explain how I got to the place you are describing.  It took a few months.  She had some very strict ground rules going in about no PDA, having her space and so on.  Our beginning was very measured.\n\nWe started traveling together.  Wanted to start giving her experiences.  First trip was to a high performance driving school at a racetrack.  Rented an AirBnB where she had her own bedroom suite if she wanted privacy at times.\n\nThen we had our third trip months later, and that trip was the clincher for me in wanting to treat her the way you describe.  Something in her changed in that trip.  With no prompting from me.  Evidence of the change came in many forms:\n\n1. I was giving her space with her own bedroom.  Not all the time.  Unprompted she started giving me shit for that because she wanted to cuddle.  I will never forget how she crawled into my tiny bed, and would not let me go.  Including play fighting and wrestling.  She didn\u2019t need to do any of this.\n\n2. In Uber rides, she would slide across and rest her head on my shoulder, and grab me by the hand.\n\n3. Went to a broadway show.  Same kind of thing with head on my shoulder and so on.  She didn\u2019t care what people thought any more.  \n\n4. Went to a concert.  Got front row seats.  Bunch of girls her age started giving her dirty looks.  Obviously disapproving of her being with me.  She started showering kisses on me and putting on a show.  Later on she explained how those \u201cbitches\u201d pissed her off, and how she thought they needed a show.  \n\nThese and countless other gestures convinced me that I wasn\u2019t just an ATM to her.  The irony is that her affection and desire to maximize time together for no additional financial gain kind of turned me into more of an ATM.\n\nSo just like OP, I have always been there when she needed me.  For things like expensive dental work, and even some therapy.  And seriously expensive experiences and travel.  And a new car when her old one was just getting more unreliable.  She never asked for any of this.  I just wanted to do it.\n\nSo my own experience and this thread tell me that when these relationships work, they are so beyond the simplistic labels that people feel compelled to attach to what we do here.  \n\nOnce again - great post OP!",

I was supposed to be a casual fling for her, a vacay from her vanilla BF.  I sure wasn't looking for the thing that developed, but as we grew into spending more and more time together, it just had a natural energy of its own.  Doubtless, if either of us had pushed it to be more than it was at any point in time, the other one may have fled to the hills.  Till the day we split, it always seemed we were getting better all the time, with no plan as to where it might end up.  u/MrBuzzard, seems like your thing went along the same path, am I correct?\n\nTakeaway?  Be glad for what you have, while you have it.  Comparison is the enemy of a fine and happy place, don't worry about what someone else has, they are not you.  Be happy for what you have.",

            "body": "I\u2019m not technically in a SR, but I don\u2019t see many comments from the SB side of things. And I approach any romantic relationship the same anyways. \n\nI think a lot of OP\u2019s list goes both ways (the parts that don\u2019t explicitly rely on one partner having decades more life experience/time to build net worth).  I want my person to know I genuinely care for him; that his sexual satisfaction is important to me; he can be himself/not be \u201cturned on\u201d; I want him to feel listened to, respected, and appreciated; and secure that I will follow through on what I say I\u2019ll do. \n\nI also hope my partner feels adored, looked up to, trusted, and like they can be vulnerable with me. \n\nThis sort of goes with not having to be \u201cturned on\u201d, but I don\u2019t want them feeling like they have to filter topics of discussion (eg filtering opinions/preferences if they\u2019re afraid of being judged, not bringing up something they\u2019re interested in as much as they\u2019d like because they assume I\u2019d find it boring, or tip-toeing around mentioning kids when we both know they exist). That\u2019s all a lot of emotional work I don\u2019t want someone I care about to waste happiness utiles on. \n\nI want them to trust I won\u2019t get annoyed over small things. Like if things aren\u2019t going perfectly at dinner/on vacation/etc, I don\u2019t want an added worry to be my emotions about it. \n\nI actually find this fairly difficult to answer since if someone is being a \u201cgood man\u201d, even in the \u201ctraditional how-dating-is-supposed-to-be\u201d sense (without the sugary part), I always worry I\u2019m getting more out of it than I give him. Especially re sexual satisfaction, I\u2019m often worried I\u2019m getting more than I\u2019m giving since I\u2019m pretty submissive (though not passive).",

But like a few others here, I'm not yet comfortable sharing my friends and other parts of my life with SBs, but we'll see.\n\nIf I can add one that's not (explicitly) on your list, for me, I also want my SB to feel like her boundaries are respected, and that I won't become clingy, jealous, needy, or fall in love. I realize this may be specific to the type of SRs I'm seeking and building with my SBs but so far we on both sides want a more drama-free, NSA experience. So I'm being careful to toe the line between \"genuinely care about her beyond the arrangement\" and \"over escalating the emotional or time labor of the relationship\".",

Every SD has a plan until he meets an SB who makes him feel alive and masculine and appreciated.  Not easy to stay NSA.   Of course, based on the number of SBs posting \"I fell in love with my SD\" posts, this can go either way, and the outcome can still be messy.\n\nFor myself, I am most decidedly looking for a highly-connected, strings-attached SR.  I found ways to help maintain things where I like them to be -- at \"luv ya!\" rather than \"I love you\" -- which lets me savor how much I adore her, without slipping into jealousy and other negative feelings.

As a minimalist, I live in a crap-hole studio apartment, and have no car, which I warn them about prior to their first visit ... so I still need to overcome that initial adverse perception.\n\nBut after that simple 'trust' objective is achieved, everything else falls into place nicely.",

I don't provide them any financial support anymore, they don't have sex with me anymore, but we're still friends -- the personal relationship part was real, we like each other, so we're in touch.\n\nBut even if it didn't, so what?

This time we hiked in a park with her toddler. She is a single mother. I had never met him before although heard him many times on phone calls and she was anxious about him becoming attached to me and our relationship ending. I understand that fully and I would never want to hurt a young child. btw, I don't see a lot of discussion about SBs with kids and what happens to them. I purchased a car seat and we had a great time. We went out for lunch after. I had to get them home before the little guy fell asleep for his mid day nap. I think its these kinds of things that make SRs special.  I wanted to hold her hand in the park but did so only in my mind. And I was very attentive to the little guy helping him explore. I did steal a kiss when I dropped her off. It was all I needed. Best date ever.",

Doubtless, if either of us had pushed it to be more than it was at any point in time, the other one may have fled to the hills.  Till the day we split, it always seemed we were getting better all the time, with no plan as to where it might end up.  u/MrBuzzard, seems like your thing went along the same path, am I correct?\n\nTakeaway?

Doubtless, if either of us had pushed it to be more than it was at any point in time, the other one may have fled to the hills.  Till the day we split, it always seemed we were getting better all the time, with no plan as to where it might end up.  u/MrBuzzard, seems like your thing went along the same path, am I correct?\n\nTakeaway?

But if you give her a big speech about how you're going to pamper her, now she has every right to have some expectations -- her idea of pampering might be very different from yours and end up disappointing her, and/or she might rely on \"I'll pamper you\" as a promise and part of the reason she accepts the allowance (in other words, it's now an entitlement rather than a delightful surprise).
