    "body": "I'm in my first sugar relationship and had my first sugar date. We checked into a super nice hotel and hung out. We didn't really have penetrative sex (the condom wouldn't fit, LOL).\n\nIt's insane how much we spoke and about so many things in the world. We couldn't fall asleep at night and went out for a long drive and found some hole-in-the-wall food place when we got hungry. \n\nIt was 4 am when we got back and fell asleep. He warned me that he snores but I totally didn't notice. I chose my daddy purely out of instinct and we're a great fit. I'm attracted to him like mad and I can't wait until we meet again.\n\nI hae no experience in being an SB, and I had neither negotiated nor expected a \"benefit\". But lo and behold, I come home to find enough crisp bills tucked away in my notebook. I made rent \u2764\ufe0f\n\nTruly grateful that I found the daddy for me. I wish the same on everyone. Lots of love.",
