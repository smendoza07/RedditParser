For me, it basically kills friss for about 24 hours and that's with using only a limited amount of the stuff. I don't really have the hair for a neat and straighter style (such as the one Evans has), but I think I could absolutely achieve my equivalent of it with maybe two globs of the stuff instead of one and some proper comb-work.\n\nIt also smells so damn nice, bees-wax and mineral oils.",

I'll send a link to the ones I've been buying for years.\n\nOrange, gray and blue. Usually on ebay or amazon for 10 bucks each and has a G in the middle. The sticker has an asian guy with localized writing on it.\n\nI use the orange one mainly as it's a loose shuffle allowing me to have a soft hold and manipulate it thru the day. \n\nI use a tiny bit of the gray stuff to have a little extra hold on the side hairs that do their own thing. \n\nAnd I use blue occasionally if I want it to have a wet look. \n\nUsually I'll do it as the hair mostly dry and then comb and use the dryer to shape. After that holds for about 10 minutes I can play with it without losing much of the style.\n\nAgain everyones hair is diff and I'm no pro but overall this has given me a lot of the looks I like, similiar to Chris, and it handles my workload. Granted when I'm active and sweating it will depend on the styling I did becuase being in the heat a lot or getting it wet will throw it off so I always keep a few hats in the car. I can typically get my hair good to go in like 5 minutes though.\n\nI will try a few of the suggestions here though since I always like having options if I'm ever in a pinch and cant order my stuff quickly.",

If you use a lot, it gets that sort of oily/fatty feel, but that IS also how pretty much the entire rockabilly scene got their hair done back in the day.\n\n(https://nostalgiacentral.com/pop-culture/fashion/brylcreem/)\n\nSo basically, too much and it gets a bit greasy, but nowhere near that sticky, half-dry, tacky and stale feeling that you get from gels or sprays, it just helps with the friss. I did it daily for a weak and my hair is WAY better now, even some two weeks after having forgotten to do it daily than it was before. Think of it as argan-oil or silk-drops or something else you just put into your hair after the shower, but it gives a light hold and some styling options as well.\n\nSo I would absolutely recommend to try it at least, usually 4-9 dollars depending on where you are, but like, it's worth a try.",

More than a drop and my hair looks oily. But one drop and it tames the frizz and gives it a nice sheen.",

The sticker has an asian guy with localized writing on it.\n\nI use the orange one mainly as it's a loose shuffle allowing me to have a soft hold and manipulate it thru the day. \n\nI use a tiny bit of the gray stuff to have a little extra hold on the side hairs that do their own thing. \n\nAnd I use blue occasionally if I want it to have a wet look. \n\nUsually I'll do it as the hair mostly dry and then comb and use the dryer to shape. After that holds for about 10 minutes I can play with it without losing much of the style.\n\nAgain everyones hair is diff and I'm no pro but overall this has given me a lot of the looks I like, similiar to Chris, and it handles my workload. Granted when I'm active and sweating it will depend on the styling I did becuase being in the heat a lot or getting it wet will throw it off so I always keep a few hats in the car. I can typically get my hair good to go in like 5 minutes though.\n\nI will try a few of the suggestions here though since I always like having options if I'm ever in a pinch and cant order my stuff quickly.",

If you use a lot, it gets that sort of oily/fatty feel, but that IS also how pretty much the entire rockabilly scene got their hair done back in the day.\n\n(https://nostalgiacentral.com/pop-culture/fashion/brylcreem/)\n\nSo basically, too much and it gets a bit greasy, but nowhere near that sticky, half-dry, tacky and stale feeling that you get from gels or sprays, it just helps with the friss. I did it daily for a weak and my hair is WAY better now, even some two weeks after having forgotten to do it daily than it was before. Think of it as argan-oil or silk-drops or something else you just put into your hair after the shower, but it gives a light hold and some styling options as well.\n\nSo I would absolutely recommend to try it at least, usually 4-9 dollars depending on where you are, but like, it's worth a try.",

For me, it basically kills friss for about 24 hours and that's with using only a limited amount of the stuff. I don't really have the hair for a neat and straighter style (such as the one Evans has), but I think I could absolutely achieve my equivalent of it with maybe two globs of the stuff instead of one and some proper comb-work.\n\nIt also smells so damn nice, bees-wax and mineral oils.",

The sticker has an asian guy with localized writing on it.\n\nI use the orange one mainly as it's a loose shuffle allowing me to have a soft hold and manipulate it thru the day. \n\nI use a tiny bit of the gray stuff to have a little extra hold on the side hairs that do their own thing. \n\nAnd I use blue occasionally if I want it to have a wet look. \n\nUsually I'll do it as the hair mostly dry and then comb and use the dryer to shape. After that holds for about 10 minutes I can play with it without losing much of the style.\n\nAgain everyones hair is diff and I'm no pro but overall this has given me a lot of the looks I like, similiar to Chris, and it handles my workload. Granted when I'm active and sweating it will depend on the styling I did becuase being in the heat a lot or getting it wet will throw it off so I always keep a few hats in the car. I can typically get my hair good to go in like 5 minutes though.\n\nI will try a few of the suggestions here though since I always like having options if I'm ever in a pinch and cant order my stuff quickly.",

If you use a lot, it gets that sort of oily/fatty feel, but that IS also how pretty much the entire rockabilly scene got their hair done back in the day.\n\n(https://nostalgiacentral.com/pop-culture/fashion/brylcreem/)\n\nSo basically, too much and it gets a bit greasy, but nowhere near that sticky, half-dry, tacky and stale feeling that you get from gels or sprays, it just helps with the friss. I did it daily for a weak and my hair is WAY better now, even some two weeks after having forgotten to do it daily than it was before. Think of it as argan-oil or silk-drops or something else you just put into your hair after the shower, but it gives a light hold and some styling options as well.\n\nSo I would absolutely recommend to try it at least, usually 4-9 dollars depending on where you are, but like, it's worth a try.",

The sticker has an asian guy with localized writing on it.\n\nI use the orange one mainly as it's a loose shuffle allowing me to have a soft hold and manipulate it thru the day. \n\nI use a tiny bit of the gray stuff to have a little extra hold on the side hairs that do their own thing. \n\nAnd I use blue occasionally if I want it to have a wet look. \n\nUsually I'll do it as the hair mostly dry and then comb and use the dryer to shape. After that holds for about 10 minutes I can play with it without losing much of the style.\n\nAgain everyones hair is diff and I'm no pro but overall this has given me a lot of the looks I like, similiar to Chris, and it handles my workload. Granted when I'm active and sweating it will depend on the styling I did becuase being in the heat a lot or getting it wet will throw it off so I always keep a few hats in the car. I can typically get my hair good to go in like 5 minutes though.\n\nI will try a few of the suggestions here though since I always like having options if I'm ever in a pinch and cant order my stuff quickly.",

I did it daily for a weak and my hair is WAY better now, even some two weeks after having forgotten to do it daily than it was before. Think of it as argan-oil or silk-drops or something else you just put into your hair after the shower, but it gives a light hold and some styling options as well.\n\nSo I would absolutely recommend to try it at least, usually 4-9 dollars depending on where you are, but like, it's worth a try.",

More than a drop and my hair looks oily. But one drop and it tames the frizz and gives it a nice sheen.",

The sticker has an asian guy with localized writing on it.\n\nI use the orange one mainly as it's a loose shuffle allowing me to have a soft hold and manipulate it thru the day. \n\nI use a tiny bit of the gray stuff to have a little extra hold on the side hairs that do their own thing. \n\nAnd I use blue occasionally if I want it to have a wet look. \n\nUsually I'll do it as the hair mostly dry and then comb and use the dryer to shape. After that holds for about 10 minutes I can play with it without losing much of the style.\n\nAgain everyones hair is diff and I'm no pro but overall this has given me a lot of the looks I like, similiar to Chris, and it handles my workload. Granted when I'm active and sweating it will depend on the styling I did becuase being in the heat a lot or getting it wet will throw it off so I always keep a few hats in the car. I can typically get my hair good to go in like 5 minutes though.\n\nI will try a few of the suggestions here though since I always like having options if I'm ever in a pinch and cant order my stuff quickly.",

I did it daily for a weak and my hair is WAY better now, even some two weeks after having forgotten to do it daily than it was before. Think of it as argan-oil or silk-drops or something else you just put into your hair after the shower, but it gives a light hold and some styling options as well.\n\nSo I would absolutely recommend to try it at least, usually 4-9 dollars depending on where you are, but like, it's worth a try.",

For me, it basically kills friss for about 24 hours and that's with using only a limited amount of the stuff. I don't really have the hair for a neat and straighter style (such as the one Evans has), but I think I could absolutely achieve my equivalent of it with maybe two globs of the stuff instead of one and some proper comb-work.\n\nIt also smells so damn nice, bees-wax and mineral oils.",
