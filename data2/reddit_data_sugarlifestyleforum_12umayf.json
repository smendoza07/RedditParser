And it is not always healing to reconnect. It can be, and we as a society fantasize it to be so, but in reality we all need healthy boundaries and to protect ourselves. There is a lot of damage and trauma that happens, on *both* sides. \n\nYou can have basic compassion by never denying someone food or shelter, but you can also have healthy boundaries by not being open to sharing the same table. \n\nIs resentment the answer? Of course not. There\u2019s no use in drinking that poison and expecting the other person to die - you only harm yourself. But you don\u2019t have to have that person in your life, and if you fear for someone else\u2019s safety or feel compelled by a moral imperative to protect someone else, then you also have to live your values to sleep at night.",

There is a lot of damage and trauma that happens, on *both* sides. \n\nYou can have basic compassion by never denying someone food or shelter, but you can also have healthy boundaries by not being open to sharing the same table. \n\nIs resentment the answer? Of course not. There\u2019s no use in drinking that poison and expecting the other person to die - you only harm yourself.
