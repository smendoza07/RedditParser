    "body": "Went past the initial M&G (which was also odd, if you don't believe me we met at a hookah place...) mostly because he offers a very high PPM and is only around once a month or so. I'm hoping it can be between something more regular.\n\n Long story short I was given 1k to eat at Olive Garden then have my tits sucked at his hotel. \n\nWas not expecting it to go this way lol",

It will be weird but it won\u2019t be a lot.  \n\nOne of my former SB\u2019s told me about a wacky SD near Santa Barbara when she was in college.  Trust fund guy that was quirky like that. He was worth $25m,  had a house near Oprah but drove a VW station wagon.  He invited her to a Ayahuasca retreat.  She\u2019s a good sport and says yes to everything so she went.  3 days of vomiting and hallucinating to open up your mind.   He could tell she didn\u2019t have fun so he gave her $25k.  He would give her $500 to meet him at Jamba Juice for 10 minutes. \n\nLong story short... be patient with the weird guys that are generous.",

He had a full time house keeper but when she was on vacation he invited my SB over and they had cereal for dinner.   They used to FaceTime and he would want her to to be eating salad or pretending she has the hiccups.  He asks her to round up some girlfriends to come over.  She though it would be some kind of orgy with him and a bunch of girls but he took them the local Indian casino for the buffet and gave them $500 each to gamble then $1000 each when he got home.",

It gives him a chance to relax and see if he reacts to you, if he wants to try another step next time, so he does not set up a command performance and risk discomfort.  \n\nYou might want to leverage that.  If he is all about boobs, you could send him some pics of different outfits and how they feature your boobs so he can choose one for your next date.  Be sure to work them into conversation, touch them for him etc.  Give him permission to focus on them.\n\nGuys who race straight to the finish line may not need as many dates.",
