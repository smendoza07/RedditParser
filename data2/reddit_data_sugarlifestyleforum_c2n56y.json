    "body": "I've added the \"Seeking Advice\" flair, not so much to apply to my exact situation, but because I would really like to know what others think/have experienced. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm in the early-to-mid stages of getting settled in a new place, and have a couple of email threads and text conversations with POT SDs currently going. One seemed initially promising---clever, articulate, all the rest. He made a point of asking for \"discretion\" and I am fine with those precautions. I am not looking to upset anyone's life, and I'm definitely not going to get preachy, that's not where my complaint lies. There's not just the scamming side of sugar; as a young woman generally and as a rape survivor personally, I am always aware of what kind of danger might be waiting for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe was adamant that a public M&G on the other side of the city, and even in the next city over, was too much risk. He offered that I could *get into his car* in the parking lot of a coffee shop, and then said things would be better if he could come straight to my home---again, *as a M&G*. I said flatly that I wasn't going to put my wellbeing at jeopardy. Over and over, he used the word \"discretion.\"  I closed the conversation by emphasizing that, as a young woman, I wouldn't go anywhere without brief public appearances first, and moreover, that I had every intention of sharing the make/model/plate of any vehicle we travelled in with my best friend (The One Hour Check In system. If I don't text her back/reply with a series of old inside jokes, she calls. If I don't answer, she knows something's wrong). It's not about outing whatever naughtiness my SD might be up to, or purposefully and maliciously damaging his reputation or career. It's about my safety. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe asked that I \"accommodate this privacy.\" Please accommodate my desire to not be murdered.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n/endrant",

            "body": "This is a no brainer.  You made the right call.  \n\nOne thing to think about, and I'll tell it as a true story.  When I first started in the bowl, sometimes SBs would say or propose things that didn't work for me.  I would engage them anyway, although looking back at it, I'm not sure why.  To talk them out of it?  To convince them they're wrong?  To convince them I'm a good guy?  In any case, I started to notice a pattern: when certain types of statements appeared (e.g.,\"I require $X to attend a M&G\" \"I know my worth\") no matter what I said in response, they never changed their mind.  Instead, the conversation ended with me frustrated, irritated, and often having been insulted by them.  In short, once someone says something that is wildly out-of-sync with me, engaging further with them just made my day worse.  And it never got me anywhere -- I literally NEVER talked a \"I require $X to attend a M&G\" POT to drop this requirement.  So, what I do is, as soon as I see this, I wish them good luck and say goodbye, and that's that.  I can't tell you how much more I enjoy my time on SA, it's one of the best decisions I've made.  And it fits into my life philosophy in general -- if you can avoid it, don't interact at all with toxic people.\n\nYou see where I'm going.  You followed this one down the rabbit hole, but next time, as soon as someone suggests getting into his car at the coffee shop, no need to do anything but say goodbye and block him.  I can nearly guarantee you, someone who thinks this is appropriate is not going to come around and see things your way.  There is literally nothing to be gained by engaging further; and dropping them on the spot both feels empowering, and avoid the irritation to come if you actually try to argue with them.",

Point is, he totally got the need for safety first and was willing to compromise. We met somewhere that he is confident he wouldn\u2019t see anyone he knew.

I have a great SD and just met my POT second and it\u2019s gone great so far, so I\u2019m not completely jaded but the two \u2018good ones\u2019 I have found is after dozens of creeps and weirdos offering me $100 and demanding sexual intimacy the minute we meet-in Private. ARE YOU KIDDING. My first thought is....if your looking for a cheap hooker there\u2019s plenty of places for that....stay off the SD and even the WYP sites because that\u2019s NOT what it\u2019s about. Well, I see it this way. They do YOU a favor. They show their true colors before even meeting so you don\u2019t waste your time with a potential horrible situation to boot. Girl I totally feel you lol",
