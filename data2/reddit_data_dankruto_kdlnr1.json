Interestingly enough, the whole final battle between Naruto and Sasuke was HEAVILY inspired by Devilman's final fight.  It's sort of a happy ending version of Devilman's ending.\n\nIn the end both are on the ground, completely exausted and mutilated. But while Sasuke says; \"I've lost.\" - the rival in Devilman says; \"I've won\" - In Naruto, Sasuke couldn't defeat the protagonist, \"loses\", and the Earth is saved. In Devilman, the protagonist dies and Earth becomes a living hell with the rival as a ruler exactly as it would be if Naruto lost.",

I wanna win fair and square, *although not against the current you*\u201d\n\nHis response leads me to believe that Naruto wants to win against sasuke under a different circumstance, against a different sasuke, not the sasuke who\u2019s trying to kill him. His context of winning is against sasuke in a friendly match (most likely a rematch of their academy fight). Therefore I don\u2019t think his response means he wants to kill sasuke.",

I wanna win fair and square, *although not against the current you*\u201d\n\nHis response leads me to believe that Naruto wants to win against sasuke under a different circumstance, against a different sasuke, not the sasuke who\u2019s trying to kill him. His context of winning is against sasuke in a friendly match (most likely a rematch of their academy fight). Therefore I don\u2019t think his response means he wants to kill sasuke.",

Then Naruto responded \u201cI do want to fight you. I wanna win fair and square, *although not against the current you*\u201d\n\nHis response leads me to believe that Naruto wants to win against sasuke under a different circumstance, against a different sasuke, not the sasuke who\u2019s trying to kill him. His context of winning is against sasuke in a friendly match (most likely a rematch of their academy fight). Therefore I don\u2019t think his response means he wants to kill sasuke.",

I wanna win fair and square, *although not against the current you*\u201d\n\nHis response leads me to believe that Naruto wants to win against sasuke under a different circumstance, against a different sasuke, not the sasuke who\u2019s trying to kill him. His context of winning is against sasuke in a friendly match (most likely a rematch of their academy fight). Therefore I don\u2019t think his response means he wants to kill sasuke.",
