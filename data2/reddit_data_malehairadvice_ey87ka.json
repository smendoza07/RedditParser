I could only do 3 styles with it; pulled back topknot, which I got bored of, pulled back loose, which was hit or miss, or just down, which looked best most times but got in my way a lot. I had buzzed back and sides, and that limited it even further. I also sported a long beard.\n\nEventually I started thinking about cutting it off. I'd think about it every now and again, then I started thinking about it a lot. When it became a major thing I thought about multiple times a day, I took the plunge. I also didn't tell any of my friends, and their reactions over that following weekend when they saw me were priceless! I also keep the beard tight and groomed, no longer than an inch. I now love my fresh and clean look, and feel fantastic when I get into a suit.\n\nDo what works for you. You seem to have an oval face, so I would keep some length on the sides, blended into medium at the top. You also seem to have the same colour hair as I do, which I accentuated with subtle blonde highlights to really give it some texture.\n\nWe need change, we get bored and it's only natural to want to do something different. I don't regret cutting it, at all. Now, when I style my hair (it's a loose pompadour, short back and sides) I always get slight variations - which I really enjoy. Even styling it is fun - it's like building something, and much more interactive than just pulling it into a bun and walking out of the house. It's also taken me from the laissez-faire/Jesus/hippie/renegade look to a smarter, more refined look.\n\nOne thing I do miss is doing viking braiding on it, though I think that looks better in pictures or on TV than it is practical in real life.",

I let it air dry, always. Aand in the end i use a \u201cSchwarzkopf Gliss Ultimate Oil Elixir\u201d thingy, from time to time. \n\nI guess that\u2019s it. The colour is a failed attempt at grey highlights, which kind of also fucked up my hair a bit, so that\u2019s why I use the elixir :) Hope that helps.",

I could only do 3 styles with it; pulled back topknot, which I got bored of, pulled back loose, which was hit or miss, or just down, which looked best most times but got in my way a lot. I had buzzed back and sides, and that limited it even further. I also sported a long beard.\n\nEventually I started thinking about cutting it off. I'd think about it every now and again, then I started thinking about it a lot. When it became a major thing I thought about multiple times a day, I took the plunge. I also didn't tell any of my friends, and their reactions over that following weekend when they saw me were priceless! I also keep the beard tight and groomed, no longer than an inch. I now love my fresh and clean look, and feel fantastic when I get into a suit.\n\nDo what works for you. You seem to have an oval face, so I would keep some length on the sides, blended into medium at the top. You also seem to have the same colour hair as I do, which I accentuated with subtle blonde highlights to really give it some texture.\n\nWe need change, we get bored and it's only natural to want to do something different. I don't regret cutting it, at all. Now, when I style my hair (it's a loose pompadour, short back and sides) I always get slight variations - which I really enjoy. Even styling it is fun - it's like building something, and much more interactive than just pulling it into a bun and walking out of the house. It's also taken me from the laissez-faire/Jesus/hippie/renegade look to a smarter, more refined look.\n\nOne thing I do miss is doing viking braiding on it, though I think that looks better in pictures or on TV than it is practical in real life.",

I wash it with a Syoss Anti-Dandruff shampoo usually and occasionally I use some Aussie shampoo that I\u2019ve peeled the label off of. After that I use a By Veira Silver Conditioner. I let it air dry, always. Aand in the end i use a \u201cSchwarzkopf Gliss Ultimate Oil Elixir\u201d thingy, from time to time. \n\nI guess that\u2019s it. The colour is a failed attempt at grey highlights, which kind of also fucked up my hair a bit, so that\u2019s why I use the elixir :) Hope that helps.",
