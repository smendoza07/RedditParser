I looked at your other post, your hair is really not thinning at all... and if it is, I don't think anyone but you would have noticed.\n\nBuzzed looks **good**, about as good as your previous look, but it's just because the previous look was also pretty short and you are a good-looking dude. If you grew it out to like two inches on the top, put some product in it and swept to the side and back, I think you'd look **great**.\n\nBut hey, it would also take 15 extra minutes in the morning to blow dry and style and might make your face look longer - you have a good face shape for buzzed and it's easy as F, so if I were in your situation I might do the same thing haha.\n\nA few other people have suggested growing a beard - don't. Beards can look good but they're for people who don't have perfect facial bone structure, jawline, etc. Keep the stubble look. It's perfect for saying \"I *could* grow a perfect beard, but I don't wanna hide this face\". The ladies tend to like cleaner / stubble anyway.",

            "body": "Looking good man. The fade is definitely what makes this look work. I'd recommend keeping regular appointments with your barber/hair cutter to keep it maintained. They can give you an idea for how regularly you would need to be going in. Every 2 weeks probably.\n\nOnly other thought is to maintain your facial hair to have clean lines. The length you've got in this pic looks great with the cut. Your jaw line and cheek lines are perfect for having your facial hair length roughly the same as the mid-length hair on your fade. Definitely gives you a clean-cut look that works with any clothing/hat style. If you go to a barber they can definitely get your facial hair set to how you want it so you can maintain from there rather than mess with getting everything perfect from the beginning. \n\nHope this helps. Keep up the good looks man!",
