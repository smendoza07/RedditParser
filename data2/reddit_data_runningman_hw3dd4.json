    "body": "I will be textually slaughtered for this but hear me out. SJH has always ALWAYS been my favourite cast member, I stan her and she is my queen. Ever since I was introduced to Running Man years ago I always supported her in every episode that I watched, so to my fellow SJH fans please know that I'm not trying to hate on her. \n\nIn the earlier episodes she was known as the \"Ace\" of Running Man, the one who was good at everything and who could change the outcome of the games single-handedly, and I'll admit I really enjoyed how important she appeared, but I feel like those days created an unhealthy and unsustainable image for her. She had to be perfect and good at everything, and any time she didn't perform up to expectation it was heavily downplayed.\n\nI'm sure everyone knows how over the last few years, SJH had been getting less screen time and was less involved than the early years. I was super worried myself that she would leave the show. I feel like a part of this was because the show couldn't figure out how to adapt SJH's old image to the new format.\n\nHere's the good part thought! In the past few episodes, I feel like Ji Hyo and the rest of the cast have adopted a new image for her, and after taking some time to understand it I've come to absolutely love it. After a long time of just being an almost invisible presence, she started getting more attention, not as a perfect \"Ace\" anymore but more for relatable, imperfect and down-to-earth aspects. I have to admit I was a tiny bit offended at \"Cavewoman\" Ji Hyo at first, but I realized that I felt I could connect to her and care for her more than ever before. Running Man has taken the last few episodes especially to develop a new character for her even more, and honestly I can't wait to see how she'll continue to contribute to the show now.\n\nJi Hyo will always be  \"Gold Jihyo\" to me, not because she wins, but because she's just that valuable.",

However, like the cast, the show has also revised its course and theme.\n\nI would love to see more of her on the show, who doesn't? Her persona there has always been reactionary and thats not a bad thing. I've seen people here complaining that she always had to have help being setup into a situation to be funny or noticed. So what? That's her role there! \n\nThe cast is just realigning itself where people are learning to properly insert themselves and not overpower each other. Its trial and error. \n\nThese days Cavewoman and Slob Ji Hyo are making their appearances. Haha. \n\nThanks for the bravery OP! It does need to be said though.",

The betrayer. \n\nKJK was always Sparta and was known for being the strong man he develeped a cuter personality for a couple episodes though\n\nHaha was known as the kid of the group before he got married, hed fall in love with every female guest and he was very silly and had more slapstick than now. Now he's more comedic in a mature way.\n\nJaesuk has had a lot of personalities but hes known for having a super nose, bullying Sukjin, being fast.\n\nSukjin will always be the race starter, he was part of the betrayer group too.\n\nJihyo as the OP said was the Ace and in the beginning she was the Monday Couple too. Now we get Blank Jihyo, Cavewoman Jihyo and Slob Jihyo.\n\nSechan and Somin are relatively new they havent had too many characters yet.\n\nScammer Kwangsoo should make a comeback.",

I want her to shine as well as all members!\n\nWhat would really be nice is if she could dress nice for an intro. Like show the world she\u2019s stunning as she always has been. I think that would help her self esteem. Not that she needs to if she\u2019s not comfortable with that, but I liked it when she dressed in really nice things and all the members and guests were like wow! It\u2019s her choice and if she\u2019s comfy in clothes that\u2019s fine. Just a thought. Imagine! Jihyo and Somin walk out in stunning outfits! Wow!",

            "body": "No hate to SJH and I like how she has improved from how she used to be, but I believe there is a great overrating of SJH's ace skills. She is also deified to the level of a goddess because of her variety character. She could change the fate of games single-handed in the early days? Typical overreaction. That was mostly KJK and even there, some scripting was involved. Everyone must know that RM in the early days was mostly scripted with certain outcomes that had to happen and they needed a strongwoman character. JH wasn't even the strongest in the bunch. They gave her that character because they needed someone to play that role. That ace role has been passed down to her from Xman and FO which were varieties with strong female characters.\n\nSJH was never a threat when strong female guests or athletes came. Even within the cast, you could see the guys often went easy on her so she could retain that title. Not saying she hasn't done her best on a male-dominated show or isn't one of the best in height missions, but this overreaction to her is partly the reason why RM fandom has become so toxic. I don't see this level of deification when it comes to other RM cast and that is why the fans can take it easy when their favourite members do not get screen time in a particular episode.\n\nI hate the deification of Korean stars in general.  They get paid for what they do and most of their variety images and the outcomes in a show with a game format like RM is scripted. JH couldn't carry the ace title after a point. It's been like that for a long time. In 2017, other than the Nevis Swing episode, her memorable moments were mostly about her luck. But that grew stale and now, she has got another character that suits her better. She is doing better than she used to be, but it is also obvious that the PDs and members and JH herself,  after the longest time, has been working hard  for it. But it is a fact that she struggled for years and it was not just because she couldn't be the ace, but because of poor variety skills. I hope she gets better at her job, but I also hope her fans who deify her appreciate the other cast who have been successful at adapting to the show without the kind of help JH has got over the years.",

It would be interesting to see if more complicated facets would come out from there since we\u2019ve gotten to see more dynamics and aspects of the cast members in recent episodes due to how much Bopil focuses on them.",

Not a hater tho, i just dislike it when people get put on a padestal for nothing that special. I understand that she's a female but in the past when she practically doesnt do anything for the whole game and ends up winning just coz someone has to turn theyre back to her ends up frustrating, mostly happened to kwang soo since his character was made to be that way.",

The title of ace derives from playing cards, as being the highest valued card, the best of the best. Out of all the running man members, she is not even close to being the smartest, fastest, strongest, wittiest, etc, all traits that are essential to majority of their missions. Luck is arguable, I don't believe in it, especially not on a television show that can easily manipulate factors to create a narrative. Braveness, second to JK imo, and possibly other members that play it up for the camera. \n\nAs for most wins, you'd have to be extremely naive to believe that she would be able to win any name-tag ripping games without any advantages from the writing and production, or members taking it easy on her or simply ignoring her. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm assuming you're not experienced or knowledgeable in any athletics or sports associated with strength. It is nearly impossible for a female with a weight disparity of (\\~40?) lbs, without any discipline in strength training to be physically stronger than any healthy male that hasn't suffered from muscle atrophy, and yes that includes JSJ. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with people putting her on a pedestal, but I believe a large percentage that do so don't realize that her title of ace is completely fabricated. Someone above mentioned being too critical of her because of prejudices against her, but the same can be said of those too complimentary of her because of biases in favor of her. Everything I mentioned above seems pretty objective, without any prejudices nor biases imo.",

RM was most scripted with fabricated scenarios and outcomes in the early years. In spy missions, it is so obvious they want the spy not to be outed till the fag end of the race. The exceptions are LKS and JSJ who can be outed because the episodes are funnier with such twists. It is an unwritten rule that RM members almost never out a member even when they know that person is suspicious. One recent example that comes to mind is how no member outed  SJH when she was the spy along with LKS in a recent episode. It was a male guest guesting on RM for the second time who mentioned her name. So did the members who have known her for 10 years get fooled because of her acting? From the expressions on everyone's faces, you could see the cast and the PDs didn't want it since it was going off script and she wouldn't get screen time. The PD then allowed her to participate in the games though she was arrested.",

For example the pebble game where they had to guess the amount of pebbles in the players\u2019 hands, she predicted correctly five times in a row- all kill game, it required no skill, she was just lucky. \n\nWhen I mentioned most wins, I meant winning the overall game/ep and in most of her solo wins, it wasn\u2019t even from normal name tag ripping ones. I don\u2019t even think she ever won overall from a name tag ripping game. I never said she was strong, just that she wasn\u2019t the weakest.\n\nI honestly don\u2019t think people are fooled into thinking rm is unscripted, in fact sometimes people even doubt when some members in general win since it is a variety show after all. As for being too complimentary, I don\u2019t see that as a problem, everyone has their own biases and of course they\u2019re going to boost them up. It\u2019s only truly a problem when others are dragged down.

You may think she's good at games because of the constant \"that's our ace\" editing shoved down every one's throat in the past. Another member could've done the same exact thing or even better without any recognition as being the 'ace'. A large proportion, especially in the early days of RM concluded with a name tag ripping game to obtain the final win/prize. It'd be impossible to claim she had the most wins without winning a good chunk of name tag ripping games. \n\nIf we can both agree that she's not even close to being the smartest, strongest, fastest, wittiest, etc, do you honestly believe that she would have the most wins solely on her own merit? Aren't the traits that I mentioned above important to be an ace? Exaggeration may be based on truth, but not necessarily every instance. For example, when SJH and LKS 'fight', heavily exaggerated, but nowhere near the truth if it were real. \n\nYou even conceded to the fact that her luck is exaggerated, which is extremely arbitrary, and the only trait that she holds above the other members. Aren't you arguing that her ace title is deserved? I don't see how gaining advantages from writing and production is deserving. \n\nI never said being too complimentary is a problem.

He was the fall in love with guests type for a while. He also was a part of the Feel-Chok-Cross thing. The betrayer. \n\nKJK was always Sparta and was known for being the strong man he develeped a cuter personality for a couple episodes though\n\nHaha was known as the kid of the group before he got married, hed fall in love with every female guest and he was very silly and had more slapstick than now. Now he's more comedic in a mature way.\n\nJaesuk has had a lot of personalities but hes known for having a super nose, bullying Sukjin, being fast.\n\nSukjin will always be the race starter, he was part of the betrayer group too.\n\nJihyo as the OP said was the Ace and in the beginning she was the Monday Couple too. Now we get Blank Jihyo, Cavewoman Jihyo and Slob Jihyo.\n\nSechan and Somin are relatively new they havent had too many characters yet.\n\nScammer Kwangsoo should make a comeback.",

For that same reason, I really love seeing warm exchanges between the cast members, which is why I\u2019m grateful we\u2019ve gotten to see more interactions between JH and SM since there is a different support system between them versus how they are separately with the guys.\n\nThat in mind, I would think that the show is better off incorporating a versatile persona by having both of those extreme ends (and whatever in between) since it then appeals to a wider audience. \n\nHowever, I am curious that if not for the pandemic, there would be more instances of the daredevil side of her Ace persona since a lot of those came out during episodes with traveling. It would be interesting to see if more complicated facets would come out from there since we\u2019ve gotten to see more dynamics and aspects of the cast members in recent episodes due to how much Bopil focuses on them.",

I understand that she's a female but in the past when she practically doesnt do anything for the whole game and ends up winning just coz someone has to turn theyre back to her ends up frustrating, mostly happened to kwang soo since his character was made to be that way.",

The title of ace derives from playing cards, as being the highest valued card, the best of the best. Out of all the running man members, she is not even close to being the smartest, fastest, strongest, wittiest, etc, all traits that are essential to majority of their missions. Luck is arguable, I don't believe in it, especially not on a television show that can easily manipulate factors to create a narrative. Braveness, second to JK imo, and possibly other members that play it up for the camera. \n\nAs for most wins, you'd have to be extremely naive to believe that she would be able to win any name-tag ripping games without any advantages from the writing and production, or members taking it easy on her or simply ignoring her. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm assuming you're not experienced or knowledgeable in any athletics or sports associated with strength. It is nearly impossible for a female with a weight disparity of (\\~40?) lbs, without any discipline in strength training to be physically stronger than any healthy male that hasn't suffered from muscle atrophy, and yes that includes JSJ. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with people putting her on a pedestal, but I believe a large percentage that do so don't realize that her title of ace is completely fabricated. Someone above mentioned being too critical of her because of prejudices against her, but the same can be said of those too complimentary of her because of biases in favor of her. Everything I mentioned above seems pretty objective, without any prejudices nor biases imo.",

RM was most scripted with fabricated scenarios and outcomes in the early years. In spy missions, it is so obvious they want the spy not to be outed till the fag end of the race. The exceptions are LKS and JSJ who can be outed because the episodes are funnier with such twists. It is an unwritten rule that RM members almost never out a member even when they know that person is suspicious. One recent example that comes to mind is how no member outed  SJH when she was the spy along with LKS in a recent episode. It was a male guest guesting on RM for the second time who mentioned her name. So did the members who have known her for 10 years get fooled because of her acting? From the expressions on everyone's faces, you could see the cast and the PDs didn't want it since it was going off script and she wouldn't get screen time. The PD then allowed her to participate in the games though she was arrested.",

You may not believe in luck but a lot of people do and although rm may exaggerate her luck, exaggeration is still based on truth. For example the pebble game where they had to guess the amount of pebbles in the players\u2019 hands, she predicted correctly five times in a row- all kill game, it required no skill, she was just lucky. \n\nWhen I mentioned most wins, I meant winning the overall game/ep and in most of her solo wins, it wasn\u2019t even from normal name tag ripping ones. I don\u2019t even think she ever won overall from a name tag ripping game. I never said she was strong, just that she wasn\u2019t the weakest.\n\nI honestly don\u2019t think people are fooled into thinking rm is unscripted, in fact sometimes people even doubt when some members in general win since it is a variety show after all. As for being too complimentary, I don\u2019t see that as a problem, everyone has their own biases and of course they\u2019re going to boost them up. It\u2019s only truly a problem when others are dragged down.

You may think she's good at games because of the constant \"that's our ace\" editing shoved down every one's throat in the past. Another member could've done the same exact thing or even better without any recognition as being the 'ace'. A large proportion, especially in the early days of RM concluded with a name tag ripping game to obtain the final win/prize. It'd be impossible to claim she had the most wins without winning a good chunk of name tag ripping games. \n\nIf we can both agree that she's not even close to being the smartest, strongest, fastest, wittiest, etc, do you honestly believe that she would have the most wins solely on her own merit? Aren't the traits that I mentioned above important to be an ace? Exaggeration may be based on truth, but not necessarily every instance. For example, when SJH and LKS 'fight', heavily exaggerated, but nowhere near the truth if it were real. \n\nYou even conceded to the fact that her luck is exaggerated, which is extremely arbitrary, and the only trait that she holds above the other members. Aren't you arguing that her ace title is deserved? I don't see how gaining advantages from writing and production is deserving. \n\nI never said being too complimentary is a problem.

It would be interesting to see if more complicated facets would come out from there since we\u2019ve gotten to see more dynamics and aspects of the cast members in recent episodes due to how much Bopil focuses on them.",

Luck is arguable, I don't believe in it, especially not on a television show that can easily manipulate factors to create a narrative. Braveness, second to JK imo, and possibly other members that play it up for the camera. \n\nAs for most wins, you'd have to be extremely naive to believe that she would be able to win any name-tag ripping games without any advantages from the writing and production, or members taking it easy on her or simply ignoring her. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm assuming you're not experienced or knowledgeable in any athletics or sports associated with strength. It is nearly impossible for a female with a weight disparity of (\\~40?) lbs, without any discipline in strength training to be physically stronger than any healthy male that hasn't suffered from muscle atrophy, and yes that includes JSJ. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with people putting her on a pedestal, but I believe a large percentage that do so don't realize that her title of ace is completely fabricated. Someone above mentioned being too critical of her because of prejudices against her, but the same can be said of those too complimentary of her because of biases in favor of her.

The exceptions are LKS and JSJ who can be outed because the episodes are funnier with such twists. It is an unwritten rule that RM members almost never out a member even when they know that person is suspicious. One recent example that comes to mind is how no member outed  SJH when she was the spy along with LKS in a recent episode. It was a male guest guesting on RM for the second time who mentioned her name. So did the members who have known her for 10 years get fooled because of her acting? From the expressions on everyone's faces, you could see the cast and the PDs didn't want it since it was going off script and she wouldn't get screen time. The PD then allowed her to participate in the games though she was arrested.",

Another member could've done the same exact thing or even better without any recognition as being the 'ace'. A large proportion, especially in the early days of RM concluded with a name tag ripping game to obtain the final win/prize. It'd be impossible to claim she had the most wins without winning a good chunk of name tag ripping games. \n\nIf we can both agree that she's not even close to being the smartest, strongest, fastest, wittiest, etc, do you honestly believe that she would have the most wins solely on her own merit? Aren't the traits that I mentioned above important to be an ace? Exaggeration may be based on truth, but not necessarily every instance.

I also hate it when people watch something/someone too critically because they have a prejudice against that person. Ji hyo was added to the cast because they thought they needed a girl or a damsel in distress but that was not the case with ji hyo because she tries her best at any challenge. And I think she deserves to be put up on a pedestal because she\u2019s an inspiration to girls that you can do anything if you try in a world that\u2019s dominated by guys.",

It would be interesting to see if more complicated facets would come out from there since we\u2019ve gotten to see more dynamics and aspects of the cast members in recent episodes due to how much Bopil focuses on them.",

The title of ace derives from playing cards, as being the highest valued card, the best of the best. Out of all the running man members, she is not even close to being the smartest, fastest, strongest, wittiest, etc, all traits that are essential to majority of their missions. Luck is arguable, I don't believe in it, especially not on a television show that can easily manipulate factors to create a narrative. Braveness, second to JK imo, and possibly other members that play it up for the camera. \n\nAs for most wins, you'd have to be extremely naive to believe that she would be able to win any name-tag ripping games without any advantages from the writing and production, or members taking it easy on her or simply ignoring her. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm assuming you're not experienced or knowledgeable in any athletics or sports associated with strength. It is nearly impossible for a female with a weight disparity of (\\~40?) lbs, without any discipline in strength training to be physically stronger than any healthy male that hasn't suffered from muscle atrophy, and yes that includes JSJ. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with people putting her on a pedestal, but I believe a large percentage that do so don't realize that her title of ace is completely fabricated. Someone above mentioned being too critical of her because of prejudices against her, but the same can be said of those too complimentary of her because of biases in favor of her. Everything I mentioned above seems pretty objective, without any prejudices nor biases imo.",

The exceptions are LKS and JSJ who can be outed because the episodes are funnier with such twists. It is an unwritten rule that RM members almost never out a member even when they know that person is suspicious. One recent example that comes to mind is how no member outed  SJH when she was the spy along with LKS in a recent episode. It was a male guest guesting on RM for the second time who mentioned her name. So did the members who have known her for 10 years get fooled because of her acting? From the expressions on everyone's faces, you could see the cast and the PDs didn't want it since it was going off script and she wouldn't get screen time. The PD then allowed her to participate in the games though she was arrested.",

For example the pebble game where they had to guess the amount of pebbles in the players\u2019 hands, she predicted correctly five times in a row- all kill game, it required no skill, she was just lucky. \n\nWhen I mentioned most wins, I meant winning the overall game/ep and in most of her solo wins, it wasn\u2019t even from normal name tag ripping ones.

Another member could've done the same exact thing or even better without any recognition as being the 'ace'.

That\u2019s ace quality, being FEARLESS. Ofc she\u2019s the weakest, she\u2019s the only girl but did she let that get on her way? NO. It\u2019s not just the Macau episode. She\u2019s the bravest one next to Jong Kook and I think that\u2019s what makes her the ace. U say you\u2019re not a hater but i think you\u2019re wrong. I also hate it when people watch something/someone too critically because they have a prejudice against that person. Ji hyo was added to the cast because they thought they needed a girl or a damsel in distress but that was not the case with ji hyo because she tries her best at any challenge. And I think she deserves to be put up on a pedestal because she\u2019s an inspiration to girls that you can do anything if you try in a world that\u2019s dominated by guys.",

The title of ace derives from playing cards, as being the highest valued card, the best of the best. Out of all the running man members, she is not even close to being the smartest, fastest, strongest, wittiest, etc, all traits that are essential to majority of their missions. Luck is arguable, I don't believe in it, especially not on a television show that can easily manipulate factors to create a narrative. Braveness, second to JK imo, and possibly other members that play it up for the camera. \n\nAs for most wins, you'd have to be extremely naive to believe that she would be able to win any name-tag ripping games without any advantages from the writing and production, or members taking it easy on her or simply ignoring her. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm assuming you're not experienced or knowledgeable in any athletics or sports associated with strength. It is nearly impossible for a female with a weight disparity of (\\~40?) lbs, without any discipline in strength training to be physically stronger than any healthy male that hasn't suffered from muscle atrophy, and yes that includes JSJ. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with people putting her on a pedestal, but I believe a large percentage that do so don't realize that her title of ace is completely fabricated. Someone above mentioned being too critical of her because of prejudices against her, but the same can be said of those too complimentary of her because of biases in favor of her. Everything I mentioned above seems pretty objective, without any prejudices nor biases imo.",

Aren't you arguing that her ace title is deserved? I don't see how gaining advantages from writing and production is deserving. \n\nI never said being too complimentary is a problem. I am saying that in the same way someone's perspective can be skewed from prior prejudices against her, the same can be said for someone with unconditional biases in favor of her.",
