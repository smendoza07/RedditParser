His team was scattered and just fighting in general when the Hyuga already made up their mind that they would personally protect Naruto, the reason why the war started. \n\n\n\n\nGuy did open the 8th gate against Madara so what gives?",

Kishimoto explains that because he decided to make Hinata into the lead heroine a while back, he used Neji\u2019s death as a way to bring her and Naruto together. He goes on to explain that although there is the scene where she stands up to Pain, he wanted to create an opening for Naruto to consciously realize that she is by his side and thank her for that, so he used Neji\u2019s death to do this. Kishimoto says that in this way Neji sort of took on the role of cupid for the two of them\n\n[Here\u2019s a link if you wanna see for yourself.](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Thread:164031?useskin=oasis)",

It has a decently thought out plot and the characters do have depth. here\u2019s some evidence to back that last claim up:\n\n\u2014 Sasori\u2019s character is stemmed from the death of his parents. this leads him to gaining interest in the concept of immortality, which he attempted to achieve through the creation of puppets (think \u2018mother and father\u2019 and \u2018sasori\u2019s human puppet\u2019). when fighting against the mother and father puppets controlled by his grandmother, his confidence dwindles down and he realizes he will never truly be immortal. he allows himself to die in an attack he\u2019d already anticipated. later in the war arc, he is revived and battles Kankuro, who is controlling Sasori\u2019s human puppet. Sasori asks that his puppets be handed down from generation to generation, and dies again. sasori\u2019s a pretty insignificant character in the grand scheme of things (not to say he wasn\u2019t interesting!) and even he\u2019s a character with depth. \n\n\u2014 Itachi. I read both books of Itachi\u2019s Story so I have a little more information on him. He started out as a prodigy to the Uchiha clan, who were upset that they were being discriminated against in Konoha. After seeing the results of the Ninja War at a young age, he dreams to rid the world of all violence. He was very serious about that dream. after graduating at the top of his class, he became a genin and gained an early promotion to chunin and aims to be the first uchiha hokage. the uchiha begin plotting a coup d\u2019etat, and urge Itachi to join the anbu to gain intel. itachi becomes a double agent to try and appease both konoha and the uchiha clan. he\u2019s eventually given an ultimatum by Danzo\u2014 kill the uchiha clan and spare your brother or die with the whole clan. itachi, following his dream of peace, eliminates the clan with the help of Obito. the third hokage promises to protect sasuke and asks where itachi will go. itachi says he will join the akatsuki and keep tabs on them to help protect konoha. this is where his story arc starts and the rest you already know from the series. he doesn\u2019t necessarily have a good story arc, as i think that the way Itachi is portrayed to be a genius, he could have found another way, especially after Shisui wanted him to protect the clan and stop the Coup at the same time. \n\nanother example of a good one is tokyo ghoul. the story\u2019s really fucked up but it\u2019s good for a horror-type anime. the whole start of the story is that Kaneki is prayed on by a woman he\u2019s been pining over, and it turns out that she\u2019s a ghoul (human-like creatures who only find sustenance in eating human flesh) and attempts to eat him after luring him to an alley known for ghoul attacks (she faked that she lived there and was scared to go alone to lure him there). large metal beams end up falling on her and killed her. kaneki is nearly killed but he is rushed to a hospital where the ghoul\u2019s organs are transplanted into his body, making him a half ghoul. it\u2019s interesting to watch him struggle to accept this fact and embrace it as the story progresses. \n\nand death note. death note is good in ways i can\u2019t begin to explain to you. death note is about a brilliant college student finding a death note, a notebook in which you can write the name of anyone and they will die. the situations that Light (the main character) is put in as a result of his power trip with the death note is incredible and keeps you on the edge of your seat. the way he figures out secrets about the death note and how he can manipulate the rules of it are always interesting to see. each character makes waves in the story, no character is just thrown in for the sake of being there. L, for example. he\u2019s the main secret investigator in the Kira case trying to track down Light. the things that L figures out and how he discovers them make him a good foil to Light. there are many other factors that make this anime one of the best out there.\n\ni would say Attack on Titan is a good one, but it seems too basic to me. it\u2019s got an interesting storyline but it\u2019s basically a glorified version of The Walking Dead, but with a few twists here and there. I got bored of it when they started looking for Eren\u2019s basement so i can\u2019t really talk about that one very much.",

So he was like for Hiruzen, what Sasuke was for Naruto. Except Naruto didn't fail.

His easiest option was to play the bad guy and hope that would inspire Sasuke to grow powerful.\n\nYes he went overboard torturing Sasuke but he had to commit to the role that he had built for himself because he wanted Sasuke to be strong.

Kishimoto explains that because he decided to make Hinata into the lead heroine a while back, he used Neji\u2019s death as a way to bring her and Naruto together. He goes on to explain that although there is the scene where she stands up to Pain, he wanted to create an opening for Naruto to consciously realize that she is by his side and thank her for that, so he used Neji\u2019s death to do this. Kishimoto says that in this way Neji sort of took on the role of cupid for the two of them\n\n[Here\u2019s a link if you wanna see for yourself.](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Thread:164031?useskin=oasis)",

It has a decently thought out plot and the characters do have depth. here\u2019s some evidence to back that last claim up:\n\n\u2014 Sasori\u2019s character is stemmed from the death of his parents. this leads him to gaining interest in the concept of immortality, which he attempted to achieve through the creation of puppets (think \u2018mother and father\u2019 and \u2018sasori\u2019s human puppet\u2019). when fighting against the mother and father puppets controlled by his grandmother, his confidence dwindles down and he realizes he will never truly be immortal. he allows himself to die in an attack he\u2019d already anticipated. later in the war arc, he is revived and battles Kankuro, who is controlling Sasori\u2019s human puppet. Sasori asks that his puppets be handed down from generation to generation, and dies again. sasori\u2019s a pretty insignificant character in the grand scheme of things (not to say he wasn\u2019t interesting!) and even he\u2019s a character with depth. \n\n\u2014 Itachi. I read both books of Itachi\u2019s Story so I have a little more information on him. He started out as a prodigy to the Uchiha clan, who were upset that they were being discriminated against in Konoha. After seeing the results of the Ninja War at a young age, he dreams to rid the world of all violence. He was very serious about that dream. after graduating at the top of his class, he became a genin and gained an early promotion to chunin and aims to be the first uchiha hokage. the uchiha begin plotting a coup d\u2019etat, and urge Itachi to join the anbu to gain intel. itachi becomes a double agent to try and appease both konoha and the uchiha clan. he\u2019s eventually given an ultimatum by Danzo\u2014 kill the uchiha clan and spare your brother or die with the whole clan. itachi, following his dream of peace, eliminates the clan with the help of Obito. the third hokage promises to protect sasuke and asks where itachi will go. itachi says he will join the akatsuki and keep tabs on them to help protect konoha. this is where his story arc starts and the rest you already know from the series. he doesn\u2019t necessarily have a good story arc, as i think that the way Itachi is portrayed to be a genius, he could have found another way, especially after Shisui wanted him to protect the clan and stop the Coup at the same time. \n\nanother example of a good one is tokyo ghoul. the story\u2019s really fucked up but it\u2019s good for a horror-type anime. the whole start of the story is that Kaneki is prayed on by a woman he\u2019s been pining over, and it turns out that she\u2019s a ghoul (human-like creatures who only find sustenance in eating human flesh) and attempts to eat him after luring him to an alley known for ghoul attacks (she faked that she lived there and was scared to go alone to lure him there). large metal beams end up falling on her and killed her. kaneki is nearly killed but he is rushed to a hospital where the ghoul\u2019s organs are transplanted into his body, making him a half ghoul. it\u2019s interesting to watch him struggle to accept this fact and embrace it as the story progresses. \n\nand death note. death note is good in ways i can\u2019t begin to explain to you. death note is about a brilliant college student finding a death note, a notebook in which you can write the name of anyone and they will die. the situations that Light (the main character) is put in as a result of his power trip with the death note is incredible and keeps you on the edge of your seat. the way he figures out secrets about the death note and how he can manipulate the rules of it are always interesting to see. each character makes waves in the story, no character is just thrown in for the sake of being there. L, for example. he\u2019s the main secret investigator in the Kira case trying to track down Light. the things that L figures out and how he discovers them make him a good foil to Light. there are many other factors that make this anime one of the best out there.\n\ni would say Attack on Titan is a good one, but it seems too basic to me. it\u2019s got an interesting storyline but it\u2019s basically a glorified version of The Walking Dead, but with a few twists here and there. I got bored of it when they started looking for Eren\u2019s basement so i can\u2019t really talk about that one very much.",

His easiest option was to play the bad guy and hope that would inspire Sasuke to grow powerful.\n\nYes he went overboard torturing Sasuke but he had to commit to the role that he had built for himself because he wanted Sasuke to be strong.

Kishimoto explains that because he decided to make Hinata into the lead heroine a while back, he used Neji\u2019s death as a way to bring her and Naruto together. He goes on to explain that although there is the scene where she stands up to Pain, he wanted to create an opening for Naruto to consciously realize that she is by his side and thank her for that, so he used Neji\u2019s death to do this. Kishimoto says that in this way Neji sort of took on the role of cupid for the two of them\n\n[Here\u2019s a link if you wanna see for yourself.](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Thread:164031?useskin=oasis)",

It has a decently thought out plot and the characters do have depth. here\u2019s some evidence to back that last claim up:\n\n\u2014 Sasori\u2019s character is stemmed from the death of his parents. this leads him to gaining interest in the concept of immortality, which he attempted to achieve through the creation of puppets (think \u2018mother and father\u2019 and \u2018sasori\u2019s human puppet\u2019). when fighting against the mother and father puppets controlled by his grandmother, his confidence dwindles down and he realizes he will never truly be immortal. he allows himself to die in an attack he\u2019d already anticipated. later in the war arc, he is revived and battles Kankuro, who is controlling Sasori\u2019s human puppet. Sasori asks that his puppets be handed down from generation to generation, and dies again. sasori\u2019s a pretty insignificant character in the grand scheme of things (not to say he wasn\u2019t interesting!) and even he\u2019s a character with depth. \n\n\u2014 Itachi. I read both books of Itachi\u2019s Story so I have a little more information on him. He started out as a prodigy to the Uchiha clan, who were upset that they were being discriminated against in Konoha. After seeing the results of the Ninja War at a young age, he dreams to rid the world of all violence. He was very serious about that dream. after graduating at the top of his class, he became a genin and gained an early promotion to chunin and aims to be the first uchiha hokage. the uchiha begin plotting a coup d\u2019etat, and urge Itachi to join the anbu to gain intel. itachi becomes a double agent to try and appease both konoha and the uchiha clan. he\u2019s eventually given an ultimatum by Danzo\u2014 kill the uchiha clan and spare your brother or die with the whole clan. itachi, following his dream of peace, eliminates the clan with the help of Obito. the third hokage promises to protect sasuke and asks where itachi will go. itachi says he will join the akatsuki and keep tabs on them to help protect konoha. this is where his story arc starts and the rest you already know from the series. he doesn\u2019t necessarily have a good story arc, as i think that the way Itachi is portrayed to be a genius, he could have found another way, especially after Shisui wanted him to protect the clan and stop the Coup at the same time. \n\nanother example of a good one is tokyo ghoul. the story\u2019s really fucked up but it\u2019s good for a horror-type anime. the whole start of the story is that Kaneki is prayed on by a woman he\u2019s been pining over, and it turns out that she\u2019s a ghoul (human-like creatures who only find sustenance in eating human flesh) and attempts to eat him after luring him to an alley known for ghoul attacks (she faked that she lived there and was scared to go alone to lure him there). large metal beams end up falling on her and killed her. kaneki is nearly killed but he is rushed to a hospital where the ghoul\u2019s organs are transplanted into his body, making him a half ghoul. it\u2019s interesting to watch him struggle to accept this fact and embrace it as the story progresses. \n\nand death note. death note is good in ways i can\u2019t begin to explain to you. death note is about a brilliant college student finding a death note, a notebook in which you can write the name of anyone and they will die. the situations that Light (the main character) is put in as a result of his power trip with the death note is incredible and keeps you on the edge of your seat. the way he figures out secrets about the death note and how he can manipulate the rules of it are always interesting to see. each character makes waves in the story, no character is just thrown in for the sake of being there. L, for example. he\u2019s the main secret investigator in the Kira case trying to track down Light. the things that L figures out and how he discovers them make him a good foil to Light. there are many other factors that make this anime one of the best out there.\n\ni would say Attack on Titan is a good one, but it seems too basic to me. it\u2019s got an interesting storyline but it\u2019s basically a glorified version of The Walking Dead, but with a few twists here and there. I got bored of it when they started looking for Eren\u2019s basement so i can\u2019t really talk about that one very much.",

So he was like for Hiruzen, what Sasuke was for Naruto. Except Naruto didn't fail.

His easiest option was to play the bad guy and hope that would inspire Sasuke to grow powerful.\n\nYes he went overboard torturing Sasuke but he had to commit to the role that he had built for himself because he wanted Sasuke to be strong.

Kishimoto explains that because he decided to make Hinata into the lead heroine a while back, he used Neji\u2019s death as a way to bring her and Naruto together. He goes on to explain that although there is the scene where she stands up to Pain, he wanted to create an opening for Naruto to consciously realize that she is by his side and thank her for that, so he used Neji\u2019s death to do this. Kishimoto says that in this way Neji sort of took on the role of cupid for the two of them\n\n[Here\u2019s a link if you wanna see for yourself.](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Thread:164031?useskin=oasis)",

It has a decently thought out plot and the characters do have depth. here\u2019s some evidence to back that last claim up:\n\n\u2014 Sasori\u2019s character is stemmed from the death of his parents. this leads him to gaining interest in the concept of immortality, which he attempted to achieve through the creation of puppets (think \u2018mother and father\u2019 and \u2018sasori\u2019s human puppet\u2019). when fighting against the mother and father puppets controlled by his grandmother, his confidence dwindles down and he realizes he will never truly be immortal. he allows himself to die in an attack he\u2019d already anticipated. later in the war arc, he is revived and battles Kankuro, who is controlling Sasori\u2019s human puppet. Sasori asks that his puppets be handed down from generation to generation, and dies again. sasori\u2019s a pretty insignificant character in the grand scheme of things (not to say he wasn\u2019t interesting!) and even he\u2019s a character with depth. \n\n\u2014 Itachi. I read both books of Itachi\u2019s Story so I have a little more information on him. He started out as a prodigy to the Uchiha clan, who were upset that they were being discriminated against in Konoha. After seeing the results of the Ninja War at a young age, he dreams to rid the world of all violence. He was very serious about that dream. after graduating at the top of his class, he became a genin and gained an early promotion to chunin and aims to be the first uchiha hokage. the uchiha begin plotting a coup d\u2019etat, and urge Itachi to join the anbu to gain intel. itachi becomes a double agent to try and appease both konoha and the uchiha clan. he\u2019s eventually given an ultimatum by Danzo\u2014 kill the uchiha clan and spare your brother or die with the whole clan. itachi, following his dream of peace, eliminates the clan with the help of Obito. the third hokage promises to protect sasuke and asks where itachi will go. itachi says he will join the akatsuki and keep tabs on them to help protect konoha. this is where his story arc starts and the rest you already know from the series. he doesn\u2019t necessarily have a good story arc, as i think that the way Itachi is portrayed to be a genius, he could have found another way, especially after Shisui wanted him to protect the clan and stop the Coup at the same time. \n\nanother example of a good one is tokyo ghoul. the story\u2019s really fucked up but it\u2019s good for a horror-type anime. the whole start of the story is that Kaneki is prayed on by a woman he\u2019s been pining over, and it turns out that she\u2019s a ghoul (human-like creatures who only find sustenance in eating human flesh) and attempts to eat him after luring him to an alley known for ghoul attacks (she faked that she lived there and was scared to go alone to lure him there). large metal beams end up falling on her and killed her. kaneki is nearly killed but he is rushed to a hospital where the ghoul\u2019s organs are transplanted into his body, making him a half ghoul. it\u2019s interesting to watch him struggle to accept this fact and embrace it as the story progresses. \n\nand death note. death note is good in ways i can\u2019t begin to explain to you. death note is about a brilliant college student finding a death note, a notebook in which you can write the name of anyone and they will die. the situations that Light (the main character) is put in as a result of his power trip with the death note is incredible and keeps you on the edge of your seat. the way he figures out secrets about the death note and how he can manipulate the rules of it are always interesting to see. each character makes waves in the story, no character is just thrown in for the sake of being there. L, for example. he\u2019s the main secret investigator in the Kira case trying to track down Light. the things that L figures out and how he discovers them make him a good foil to Light. there are many other factors that make this anime one of the best out there.\n\ni would say Attack on Titan is a good one, but it seems too basic to me. it\u2019s got an interesting storyline but it\u2019s basically a glorified version of The Walking Dead, but with a few twists here and there. I got bored of it when they started looking for Eren\u2019s basement so i can\u2019t really talk about that one very much.",

Iirc, he was willing to even pass on the Hokage status to one of them.

Meanwhile Danzo held secret meetings with Itachi and told him there's no way around the solution of genocide.   \nAnd in the video below, Hiruzen goes to show that he still saw the Uchihas as part of the village and that their massacre was a tragedy.

That revelation drove 16 year old Sasuke temporarily insane. That would have messed up kid Sasuke even worse than Gaara. His easiest option was to play the bad guy and hope that would inspire Sasuke to grow powerful.\n\nYes he went overboard torturing Sasuke but he had to commit to the role that he had built for himself because he wanted Sasuke to be strong.

Kishimoto explains that because he decided to make Hinata into the lead heroine a while back, he used Neji\u2019s death as a way to bring her and Naruto together. He goes on to explain that although there is the scene where she stands up to Pain, he wanted to create an opening for Naruto to consciously realize that she is by his side and thank her for that, so he used Neji\u2019s death to do this.

It has a decently thought out plot and the characters do have depth. here\u2019s some evidence to back that last claim up:\n\n\u2014 Sasori\u2019s character is stemmed from the death of his parents. this leads him to gaining interest in the concept of immortality, which he attempted to achieve through the creation of puppets (think \u2018mother and father\u2019 and \u2018sasori\u2019s human puppet\u2019). when fighting against the mother and father puppets controlled by his grandmother, his confidence dwindles down and he realizes he will never truly be immortal. he allows himself to die in an attack he\u2019d already anticipated. later in the war arc, he is revived and battles Kankuro, who is controlling Sasori\u2019s human puppet. Sasori asks that his puppets be handed down from generation to generation, and dies again. sasori\u2019s a pretty insignificant character in the grand scheme of things (not to say he wasn\u2019t interesting!) and even he\u2019s a character with depth. \n\n\u2014 Itachi. I read both books of Itachi\u2019s Story so I have a little more information on him. He started out as a prodigy to the Uchiha clan, who were upset that they were being discriminated against in Konoha. After seeing the results of the Ninja War at a young age, he dreams to rid the world of all violence. He was very serious about that dream. after graduating at the top of his class, he became a genin and gained an early promotion to chunin and aims to be the first uchiha hokage. the uchiha begin plotting a coup d\u2019etat, and urge Itachi to join the anbu to gain intel. itachi becomes a double agent to try and appease both konoha and the uchiha clan. he\u2019s eventually given an ultimatum by Danzo\u2014 kill the uchiha clan and spare your brother or die with the whole clan. itachi, following his dream of peace, eliminates the clan with the help of Obito. the third hokage promises to protect sasuke and asks where itachi will go. itachi says he will join the akatsuki and keep tabs on them to help protect konoha. this is where his story arc starts and the rest you already know from the series. he doesn\u2019t necessarily have a good story arc, as i think that the way Itachi is portrayed to be a genius, he could have found another way, especially after Shisui wanted him to protect the clan and stop the Coup at the same time. \n\nanother example of a good one is tokyo ghoul. the story\u2019s really fucked up but it\u2019s good for a horror-type anime. the whole start of the story is that Kaneki is prayed on by a woman he\u2019s been pining over, and it turns out that she\u2019s a ghoul (human-like creatures who only find sustenance in eating human flesh) and attempts to eat him after luring him to an alley known for ghoul attacks (she faked that she lived there and was scared to go alone to lure him there). large metal beams end up falling on her and killed her. kaneki is nearly killed but he is rushed to a hospital where the ghoul\u2019s organs are transplanted into his body, making him a half ghoul. it\u2019s interesting to watch him struggle to accept this fact and embrace it as the story progresses. \n\nand death note. death note is good in ways i can\u2019t begin to explain to you. death note is about a brilliant college student finding a death note, a notebook in which you can write the name of anyone and they will die. the situations that Light (the main character) is put in as a result of his power trip with the death note is incredible and keeps you on the edge of your seat. the way he figures out secrets about the death note and how he can manipulate the rules of it are always interesting to see. each character makes waves in the story, no character is just thrown in for the sake of being there. L, for example. he\u2019s the main secret investigator in the Kira case trying to track down Light. the things that L figures out and how he discovers them make him a good foil to Light. there are many other factors that make this anime one of the best out there.\n\ni would say Attack on Titan is a good one, but it seems too basic to me. it\u2019s got an interesting storyline but it\u2019s basically a glorified version of The Walking Dead, but with a few twists here and there. I got bored of it when they started looking for Eren\u2019s basement so i can\u2019t really talk about that one very much.",

Iirc, he was willing to even pass on the Hokage status to one of them. In one of the meetings, he's with the other 2 Village Elders and Itachi, and he specifically asks Itachi to buy him some more time. Meanwhile Danzo held secret meetings with Itachi and told him there's no way around the solution of genocide.   \nAnd in the video below, Hiruzen goes to show that he still saw the Uchihas as part of the village and that their massacre was a tragedy. He then demotes Danzo, cuz he knows Danzo made/told Itachi to do it.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzKjwoi-qRo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzKjwoi-qRo)",

His easiest option was to play the bad guy and hope that would inspire Sasuke to grow powerful.\n\nYes he went overboard torturing Sasuke but he had to commit to the role that he had built for himself because he wanted Sasuke to be strong.

It has a decently thought out plot and the characters do have depth. here\u2019s some evidence to back that last claim up:\n\n\u2014 Sasori\u2019s character is stemmed from the death of his parents. this leads him to gaining interest in the concept of immortality, which he attempted to achieve through the creation of puppets (think \u2018mother and father\u2019 and \u2018sasori\u2019s human puppet\u2019). when fighting against the mother and father puppets controlled by his grandmother, his confidence dwindles down and he realizes he will never truly be immortal. he allows himself to die in an attack he\u2019d already anticipated. later in the war arc, he is revived and battles Kankuro, who is controlling Sasori\u2019s human puppet. Sasori asks that his puppets be handed down from generation to generation, and dies again. sasori\u2019s a pretty insignificant character in the grand scheme of things (not to say he wasn\u2019t interesting!) and even he\u2019s a character with depth. \n\n\u2014 Itachi. I read both books of Itachi\u2019s Story so I have a little more information on him. He started out as a prodigy to the Uchiha clan, who were upset that they were being discriminated against in Konoha. After seeing the results of the Ninja War at a young age, he dreams to rid the world of all violence. He was very serious about that dream. after graduating at the top of his class, he became a genin and gained an early promotion to chunin and aims to be the first uchiha hokage. the uchiha begin plotting a coup d\u2019etat, and urge Itachi to join the anbu to gain intel. itachi becomes a double agent to try and appease both konoha and the uchiha clan. he\u2019s eventually given an ultimatum by Danzo\u2014 kill the uchiha clan and spare your brother or die with the whole clan. itachi, following his dream of peace, eliminates the clan with the help of Obito. the third hokage promises to protect sasuke and asks where itachi will go. itachi says he will join the akatsuki and keep tabs on them to help protect konoha. this is where his story arc starts and the rest you already know from the series. he doesn\u2019t necessarily have a good story arc, as i think that the way Itachi is portrayed to be a genius, he could have found another way, especially after Shisui wanted him to protect the clan and stop the Coup at the same time. \n\nanother example of a good one is tokyo ghoul. the story\u2019s really fucked up but it\u2019s good for a horror-type anime. the whole start of the story is that Kaneki is prayed on by a woman he\u2019s been pining over, and it turns out that she\u2019s a ghoul (human-like creatures who only find sustenance in eating human flesh) and attempts to eat him after luring him to an alley known for ghoul attacks (she faked that she lived there and was scared to go alone to lure him there). large metal beams end up falling on her and killed her. kaneki is nearly killed but he is rushed to a hospital where the ghoul\u2019s organs are transplanted into his body, making him a half ghoul. it\u2019s interesting to watch him struggle to accept this fact and embrace it as the story progresses. \n\nand death note. death note is good in ways i can\u2019t begin to explain to you. death note is about a brilliant college student finding a death note, a notebook in which you can write the name of anyone and they will die. the situations that Light (the main character) is put in as a result of his power trip with the death note is incredible and keeps you on the edge of your seat. the way he figures out secrets about the death note and how he can manipulate the rules of it are always interesting to see. each character makes waves in the story, no character is just thrown in for the sake of being there. L, for example. he\u2019s the main secret investigator in the Kira case trying to track down Light. the things that L figures out and how he discovers them make him a good foil to Light. there are many other factors that make this anime one of the best out there.\n\ni would say Attack on Titan is a good one, but it seems too basic to me. it\u2019s got an interesting storyline but it\u2019s basically a glorified version of The Walking Dead, but with a few twists here and there. I got bored of it when they started looking for Eren\u2019s basement so i can\u2019t really talk about that one very much.",

So he was like for Hiruzen, what Sasuke was for Naruto. Except Naruto didn't fail. But like they say, not everyone is Naruto, and he himself is the first reincarnation of Ashura who broke the cycle.",

That revelation drove 16 year old Sasuke temporarily insane. That would have messed up kid Sasuke even worse than Gaara. His easiest option was to play the bad guy and hope that would inspire Sasuke to grow powerful.\n\nYes he went overboard torturing Sasuke but he had to commit to the role that he had built for himself because he wanted Sasuke to be strong. But he also admits that he was wrong to channel Sasuke's emotion towards hatred and regrets his approach.",

It has a decently thought out plot and the characters do have depth. here\u2019s some evidence to back that last claim up:\n\n\u2014 Sasori\u2019s character is stemmed from the death of his parents. this leads him to gaining interest in the concept of immortality, which he attempted to achieve through the creation of puppets (think \u2018mother and father\u2019 and \u2018sasori\u2019s human puppet\u2019). when fighting against the mother and father puppets controlled by his grandmother, his confidence dwindles down and he realizes he will never truly be immortal. he allows himself to die in an attack he\u2019d already anticipated. later in the war arc, he is revived and battles Kankuro, who is controlling Sasori\u2019s human puppet. Sasori asks that his puppets be handed down from generation to generation, and dies again. sasori\u2019s a pretty insignificant character in the grand scheme of things (not to say he wasn\u2019t interesting!) and even he\u2019s a character with depth. \n\n\u2014 Itachi. I read both books of Itachi\u2019s Story so I have a little more information on him. He started out as a prodigy to the Uchiha clan, who were upset that they were being discriminated against in Konoha. After seeing the results of the Ninja War at a young age, he dreams to rid the world of all violence. He was very serious about that dream. after graduating at the top of his class, he became a genin and gained an early promotion to chunin and aims to be the first uchiha hokage. the uchiha begin plotting a coup d\u2019etat, and urge Itachi to join the anbu to gain intel. itachi becomes a double agent to try and appease both konoha and the uchiha clan. he\u2019s eventually given an ultimatum by Danzo\u2014 kill the uchiha clan and spare your brother or die with the whole clan. itachi, following his dream of peace, eliminates the clan with the help of Obito. the third hokage promises to protect sasuke and asks where itachi will go. itachi says he will join the akatsuki and keep tabs on them to help protect konoha. this is where his story arc starts and the rest you already know from the series. he doesn\u2019t necessarily have a good story arc, as i think that the way Itachi is portrayed to be a genius, he could have found another way, especially after Shisui wanted him to protect the clan and stop the Coup at the same time. \n\nanother example of a good one is tokyo ghoul. the story\u2019s really fucked up but it\u2019s good for a horror-type anime. the whole start of the story is that Kaneki is prayed on by a woman he\u2019s been pining over, and it turns out that she\u2019s a ghoul (human-like creatures who only find sustenance in eating human flesh) and attempts to eat him after luring him to an alley known for ghoul attacks (she faked that she lived there and was scared to go alone to lure him there). large metal beams end up falling on her and killed her. kaneki is nearly killed but he is rushed to a hospital where the ghoul\u2019s organs are transplanted into his body, making him a half ghoul. it\u2019s interesting to watch him struggle to accept this fact and embrace it as the story progresses. \n\nand death note. death note is good in ways i can\u2019t begin to explain to you. death note is about a brilliant college student finding a death note, a notebook in which you can write the name of anyone and they will die. the situations that Light (the main character) is put in as a result of his power trip with the death note is incredible and keeps you on the edge of your seat. the way he figures out secrets about the death note and how he can manipulate the rules of it are always interesting to see. each character makes waves in the story, no character is just thrown in for the sake of being there. L, for example. he\u2019s the main secret investigator in the Kira case trying to track down Light. the things that L figures out and how he discovers them make him a good foil to Light. there are many other factors that make this anime one of the best out there.\n\ni would say Attack on Titan is a good one, but it seems too basic to me. it\u2019s got an interesting storyline but it\u2019s basically a glorified version of The Walking Dead, but with a few twists here and there. I got bored of it when they started looking for Eren\u2019s basement so i can\u2019t really talk about that one very much.",

Meanwhile Danzo held secret meetings with Itachi and told him there's no way around the solution of genocide.   \nAnd in the video below, Hiruzen goes to show that he still saw the Uchihas as part of the village and that their massacre was a tragedy.

                                                                    "body": "that\u2019s just you being blind and biased. do you just not like anime in general because there ARE some pretty good ones. here\u2019s an example of three popular anime:\n\nNaruto is a prime example of a good one. It has a decently thought out plot and the characters do have depth. here\u2019s some evidence to back that last claim up:\n\n\u2014 Sasori\u2019s character is stemmed from the death of his parents. this leads him to gaining interest in the concept of immortality, which he attempted to achieve through the creation of puppets (think \u2018mother and father\u2019 and \u2018sasori\u2019s human puppet\u2019). when fighting against the mother and father puppets controlled by his grandmother, his confidence dwindles down and he realizes he will never truly be immortal. he allows himself to die in an attack he\u2019d already anticipated. later in the war arc, he is revived and battles Kankuro, who is controlling Sasori\u2019s human puppet. Sasori asks that his puppets be handed down from generation to generation, and dies again. sasori\u2019s a pretty insignificant character in the grand scheme of things (not to say he wasn\u2019t interesting!) and even he\u2019s a character with depth. \n\n\u2014 Itachi. I read both books of Itachi\u2019s Story so I have a little more information on him. He started out as a prodigy to the Uchiha clan, who were upset that they were being discriminated against in Konoha. After seeing the results of the Ninja War at a young age, he dreams to rid the world of all violence. He was very serious about that dream. after graduating at the top of his class, he became a genin and gained an early promotion to chunin and aims to be the first uchiha hokage. the uchiha begin plotting a coup d\u2019etat, and urge Itachi to join the anbu to gain intel. itachi becomes a double agent to try and appease both konoha and the uchiha clan. he\u2019s eventually given an ultimatum by Danzo\u2014 kill the uchiha clan and spare your brother or die with the whole clan. itachi, following his dream of peace, eliminates the clan with the help of Obito. the third hokage promises to protect sasuke and asks where itachi will go. itachi says he will join the akatsuki and keep tabs on them to help protect konoha. this is where his story arc starts and the rest you already know from the series. he doesn\u2019t necessarily have a good story arc, as i think that the way Itachi is portrayed to be a genius, he could have found another way, especially after Shisui wanted him to protect the clan and stop the Coup at the same time. \n\nanother example of a good one is tokyo ghoul. the story\u2019s really fucked up but it\u2019s good for a horror-type anime. the whole start of the story is that Kaneki is prayed on by a woman he\u2019s been pining over, and it turns out that she\u2019s a ghoul (human-like creatures who only find sustenance in eating human flesh) and attempts to eat him after luring him to an alley known for ghoul attacks (she faked that she lived there and was scared to go alone to lure him there). large metal beams end up falling on her and killed her. kaneki is nearly killed but he is rushed to a hospital where the ghoul\u2019s organs are transplanted into his body, making him a half ghoul. it\u2019s interesting to watch him struggle to accept this fact and embrace it as the story progresses. \n\nand death note. death note is good in ways i can\u2019t begin to explain to you. death note is about a brilliant college student finding a death note, a notebook in which you can write the name of anyone and they will die. the situations that Light (the main character) is put in as a result of his power trip with the death note is incredible and keeps you on the edge of your seat. the way he figures out secrets about the death note and how he can manipulate the rules of it are always interesting to see. each character makes waves in the story, no character is just thrown in for the sake of being there. L, for example. he\u2019s the main secret investigator in the Kira case trying to track down Light. the things that L figures out and how he discovers them make him a good foil to Light. there are many other factors that make this anime one of the best out there.\n\ni would say Attack on Titan is a good one, but it seems too basic to me. it\u2019s got an interesting storyline but it\u2019s basically a glorified version of The Walking Dead, but with a few twists here and there. I got bored of it when they started looking for Eren\u2019s basement so i can\u2019t really talk about that one very much.",

It has a decently thought out plot and the characters do have depth. here\u2019s some evidence to back that last claim up:\n\n\u2014 Sasori\u2019s character is stemmed from the death of his parents. this leads him to gaining interest in the concept of immortality, which he attempted to achieve through the creation of puppets (think \u2018mother and father\u2019 and \u2018sasori\u2019s human puppet\u2019). when fighting against the mother and father puppets controlled by his grandmother, his confidence dwindles down and he realizes he will never truly be immortal. he allows himself to die in an attack he\u2019d already anticipated. later in the war arc, he is revived and battles Kankuro, who is controlling Sasori\u2019s human puppet. Sasori asks that his puppets be handed down from generation to generation, and dies again. sasori\u2019s a pretty insignificant character in the grand scheme of things (not to say he wasn\u2019t interesting!) and even he\u2019s a character with depth. \n\n\u2014 Itachi. I read both books of Itachi\u2019s Story so I have a little more information on him. He started out as a prodigy to the Uchiha clan, who were upset that they were being discriminated against in Konoha. After seeing the results of the Ninja War at a young age, he dreams to rid the world of all violence. He was very serious about that dream. after graduating at the top of his class, he became a genin and gained an early promotion to chunin and aims to be the first uchiha hokage. the uchiha begin plotting a coup d\u2019etat, and urge Itachi to join the anbu to gain intel. itachi becomes a double agent to try and appease both konoha and the uchiha clan. he\u2019s eventually given an ultimatum by Danzo\u2014 kill the uchiha clan and spare your brother or die with the whole clan. itachi, following his dream of peace, eliminates the clan with the help of Obito. the third hokage promises to protect sasuke and asks where itachi will go. itachi says he will join the akatsuki and keep tabs on them to help protect konoha. this is where his story arc starts and the rest you already know from the series. he doesn\u2019t necessarily have a good story arc, as i think that the way Itachi is portrayed to be a genius, he could have found another way, especially after Shisui wanted him to protect the clan and stop the Coup at the same time. \n\nanother example of a good one is tokyo ghoul. the story\u2019s really fucked up but it\u2019s good for a horror-type anime. the whole start of the story is that Kaneki is prayed on by a woman he\u2019s been pining over, and it turns out that she\u2019s a ghoul (human-like creatures who only find sustenance in eating human flesh) and attempts to eat him after luring him to an alley known for ghoul attacks (she faked that she lived there and was scared to go alone to lure him there). large metal beams end up falling on her and killed her. kaneki is nearly killed but he is rushed to a hospital where the ghoul\u2019s organs are transplanted into his body, making him a half ghoul. it\u2019s interesting to watch him struggle to accept this fact and embrace it as the story progresses. \n\nand death note. death note is good in ways i can\u2019t begin to explain to you. death note is about a brilliant college student finding a death note, a notebook in which you can write the name of anyone and they will die. the situations that Light (the main character) is put in as a result of his power trip with the death note is incredible and keeps you on the edge of your seat. the way he figures out secrets about the death note and how he can manipulate the rules of it are always interesting to see. each character makes waves in the story, no character is just thrown in for the sake of being there. L, for example. he\u2019s the main secret investigator in the Kira case trying to track down Light. the things that L figures out and how he discovers them make him a good foil to Light. there are many other factors that make this anime one of the best out there.\n\ni would say Attack on Titan is a good one, but it seems too basic to me. it\u2019s got an interesting storyline but it\u2019s basically a glorified version of The Walking Dead, but with a few twists here and there. I got bored of it when they started looking for Eren\u2019s basement so i can\u2019t really talk about that one very much.",

The reason he was called a traitor was because he wanted to preserve the honor of the clan and hide the coup.\n\n2nd- wtf does \"you cant kill men\" mean? He made an innocent man kill an entire clan. He coudlve just killed or arrested Danzo?",

So he was like for Hiruzen, what Sasuke was for Naruto. Except Naruto didn't fail.

It has a decently thought out plot and the characters do have depth. here\u2019s some evidence to back that last claim up:\n\n\u2014 Sasori\u2019s character is stemmed from the death of his parents. this leads him to gaining interest in the concept of immortality, which he attempted to achieve through the creation of puppets (think \u2018mother and father\u2019 and \u2018sasori\u2019s human puppet\u2019). when fighting against the mother and father puppets controlled by his grandmother, his confidence dwindles down and he realizes he will never truly be immortal. he allows himself to die in an attack he\u2019d already anticipated. later in the war arc, he is revived and battles Kankuro, who is controlling Sasori\u2019s human puppet. Sasori asks that his puppets be handed down from generation to generation, and dies again. sasori\u2019s a pretty insignificant character in the grand scheme of things (not to say he wasn\u2019t interesting!) and even he\u2019s a character with depth. \n\n\u2014 Itachi. I read both books of Itachi\u2019s Story so I have a little more information on him. He started out as a prodigy to the Uchiha clan, who were upset that they were being discriminated against in Konoha. After seeing the results of the Ninja War at a young age, he dreams to rid the world of all violence. He was very serious about that dream. after graduating at the top of his class, he became a genin and gained an early promotion to chunin and aims to be the first uchiha hokage. the uchiha begin plotting a coup d\u2019etat, and urge Itachi to join the anbu to gain intel. itachi becomes a double agent to try and appease both konoha and the uchiha clan. he\u2019s eventually given an ultimatum by Danzo\u2014 kill the uchiha clan and spare your brother or die with the whole clan. itachi, following his dream of peace, eliminates the clan with the help of Obito. the third hokage promises to protect sasuke and asks where itachi will go. itachi says he will join the akatsuki and keep tabs on them to help protect konoha. this is where his story arc starts and the rest you already know from the series. he doesn\u2019t necessarily have a good story arc, as i think that the way Itachi is portrayed to be a genius, he could have found another way, especially after Shisui wanted him to protect the clan and stop the Coup at the same time. \n\nanother example of a good one is tokyo ghoul. the story\u2019s really fucked up but it\u2019s good for a horror-type anime. the whole start of the story is that Kaneki is prayed on by a woman he\u2019s been pining over, and it turns out that she\u2019s a ghoul (human-like creatures who only find sustenance in eating human flesh) and attempts to eat him after luring him to an alley known for ghoul attacks (she faked that she lived there and was scared to go alone to lure him there). large metal beams end up falling on her and killed her. kaneki is nearly killed but he is rushed to a hospital where the ghoul\u2019s organs are transplanted into his body, making him a half ghoul. it\u2019s interesting to watch him struggle to accept this fact and embrace it as the story progresses. \n\nand death note. death note is good in ways i can\u2019t begin to explain to you. death note is about a brilliant college student finding a death note, a notebook in which you can write the name of anyone and they will die. the situations that Light (the main character) is put in as a result of his power trip with the death note is incredible and keeps you on the edge of your seat. the way he figures out secrets about the death note and how he can manipulate the rules of it are always interesting to see. each character makes waves in the story, no character is just thrown in for the sake of being there. L, for example. he\u2019s the main secret investigator in the Kira case trying to track down Light. the things that L figures out and how he discovers them make him a good foil to Light. there are many other factors that make this anime one of the best out there.\n\ni would say Attack on Titan is a good one, but it seems too basic to me. it\u2019s got an interesting storyline but it\u2019s basically a glorified version of The Walking Dead, but with a few twists here and there. I got bored of it when they started looking for Eren\u2019s basement so i can\u2019t really talk about that one very much.",

Meanwhile Danzo held secret meetings with Itachi and told him there's no way around the solution of genocide.   \nAnd in the video below, Hiruzen goes to show that he still saw the Uchihas as part of the village and that their massacre was a tragedy.

It has a decently thought out plot and the characters do have depth. here\u2019s some evidence to back that last claim up:\n\n\u2014 Sasori\u2019s character is stemmed from the death of his parents. this leads him to gaining interest in the concept of immortality, which he attempted to achieve through the creation of puppets (think \u2018mother and father\u2019 and \u2018sasori\u2019s human puppet\u2019). when fighting against the mother and father puppets controlled by his grandmother, his confidence dwindles down and he realizes he will never truly be immortal. he allows himself to die in an attack he\u2019d already anticipated. later in the war arc, he is revived and battles Kankuro, who is controlling Sasori\u2019s human puppet. Sasori asks that his puppets be handed down from generation to generation, and dies again. sasori\u2019s a pretty insignificant character in the grand scheme of things (not to say he wasn\u2019t interesting!) and even he\u2019s a character with depth. \n\n\u2014 Itachi. I read both books of Itachi\u2019s Story so I have a little more information on him. He started out as a prodigy to the Uchiha clan, who were upset that they were being discriminated against in Konoha. After seeing the results of the Ninja War at a young age, he dreams to rid the world of all violence. He was very serious about that dream. after graduating at the top of his class, he became a genin and gained an early promotion to chunin and aims to be the first uchiha hokage. the uchiha begin plotting a coup d\u2019etat, and urge Itachi to join the anbu to gain intel. itachi becomes a double agent to try and appease both konoha and the uchiha clan. he\u2019s eventually given an ultimatum by Danzo\u2014 kill the uchiha clan and spare your brother or die with the whole clan. itachi, following his dream of peace, eliminates the clan with the help of Obito. the third hokage promises to protect sasuke and asks where itachi will go. itachi says he will join the akatsuki and keep tabs on them to help protect konoha. this is where his story arc starts and the rest you already know from the series. he doesn\u2019t necessarily have a good story arc, as i think that the way Itachi is portrayed to be a genius, he could have found another way, especially after Shisui wanted him to protect the clan and stop the Coup at the same time. \n\nanother example of a good one is tokyo ghoul. the story\u2019s really fucked up but it\u2019s good for a horror-type anime. the whole start of the story is that Kaneki is prayed on by a woman he\u2019s been pining over, and it turns out that she\u2019s a ghoul (human-like creatures who only find sustenance in eating human flesh) and attempts to eat him after luring him to an alley known for ghoul attacks (she faked that she lived there and was scared to go alone to lure him there). large metal beams end up falling on her and killed her. kaneki is nearly killed but he is rushed to a hospital where the ghoul\u2019s organs are transplanted into his body, making him a half ghoul. it\u2019s interesting to watch him struggle to accept this fact and embrace it as the story progresses. \n\nand death note. death note is good in ways i can\u2019t begin to explain to you. death note is about a brilliant college student finding a death note, a notebook in which you can write the name of anyone and they will die. the situations that Light (the main character) is put in as a result of his power trip with the death note is incredible and keeps you on the edge of your seat. the way he figures out secrets about the death note and how he can manipulate the rules of it are always interesting to see. each character makes waves in the story, no character is just thrown in for the sake of being there. L, for example. he\u2019s the main secret investigator in the Kira case trying to track down Light. the things that L figures out and how he discovers them make him a good foil to Light. there are many other factors that make this anime one of the best out there.\n\ni would say Attack on Titan is a good one, but it seems too basic to me. it\u2019s got an interesting storyline but it\u2019s basically a glorified version of The Walking Dead, but with a few twists here and there. I got bored of it when they started looking for Eren\u2019s basement so i can\u2019t really talk about that one very much.",

It has a decently thought out plot and the characters do have depth. here\u2019s some evidence to back that last claim up:\n\n\u2014 Sasori\u2019s character is stemmed from the death of his parents. this leads him to gaining interest in the concept of immortality, which he attempted to achieve through the creation of puppets (think \u2018mother and father\u2019 and \u2018sasori\u2019s human puppet\u2019). when fighting against the mother and father puppets controlled by his grandmother, his confidence dwindles down and he realizes he will never truly be immortal. he allows himself to die in an attack he\u2019d already anticipated. later in the war arc, he is revived and battles Kankuro, who is controlling Sasori\u2019s human puppet. Sasori asks that his puppets be handed down from generation to generation, and dies again. sasori\u2019s a pretty insignificant character in the grand scheme of things (not to say he wasn\u2019t interesting!) and even he\u2019s a character with depth. \n\n\u2014 Itachi. I read both books of Itachi\u2019s Story so I have a little more information on him. He started out as a prodigy to the Uchiha clan, who were upset that they were being discriminated against in Konoha. After seeing the results of the Ninja War at a young age, he dreams to rid the world of all violence. He was very serious about that dream. after graduating at the top of his class, he became a genin and gained an early promotion to chunin and aims to be the first uchiha hokage. the uchiha begin plotting a coup d\u2019etat, and urge Itachi to join the anbu to gain intel. itachi becomes a double agent to try and appease both konoha and the uchiha clan. he\u2019s eventually given an ultimatum by Danzo\u2014 kill the uchiha clan and spare your brother or die with the whole clan. itachi, following his dream of peace, eliminates the clan with the help of Obito. the third hokage promises to protect sasuke and asks where itachi will go. itachi says he will join the akatsuki and keep tabs on them to help protect konoha. this is where his story arc starts and the rest you already know from the series. he doesn\u2019t necessarily have a good story arc, as i think that the way Itachi is portrayed to be a genius, he could have found another way, especially after Shisui wanted him to protect the clan and stop the Coup at the same time. \n\nanother example of a good one is tokyo ghoul. the story\u2019s really fucked up but it\u2019s good for a horror-type anime. the whole start of the story is that Kaneki is prayed on by a woman he\u2019s been pining over, and it turns out that she\u2019s a ghoul (human-like creatures who only find sustenance in eating human flesh) and attempts to eat him after luring him to an alley known for ghoul attacks (she faked that she lived there and was scared to go alone to lure him there). large metal beams end up falling on her and killed her. kaneki is nearly killed but he is rushed to a hospital where the ghoul\u2019s organs are transplanted into his body, making him a half ghoul. it\u2019s interesting to watch him struggle to accept this fact and embrace it as the story progresses. \n\nand death note. death note is good in ways i can\u2019t begin to explain to you. death note is about a brilliant college student finding a death note, a notebook in which you can write the name of anyone and they will die. the situations that Light (the main character) is put in as a result of his power trip with the death note is incredible and keeps you on the edge of your seat. the way he figures out secrets about the death note and how he can manipulate the rules of it are always interesting to see. each character makes waves in the story, no character is just thrown in for the sake of being there. L, for example. he\u2019s the main secret investigator in the Kira case trying to track down Light. the things that L figures out and how he discovers them make him a good foil to Light. there are many other factors that make this anime one of the best out there.\n\ni would say Attack on Titan is a good one, but it seems too basic to me. it\u2019s got an interesting storyline but it\u2019s basically a glorified version of The Walking Dead, but with a few twists here and there. I got bored of it when they started looking for Eren\u2019s basement so i can\u2019t really talk about that one very much.",

                            "body": "that\u2019s just you being blind and biased. do you just not like anime in general because there ARE some pretty good ones. here\u2019s an example of three popular anime:\n\nNaruto is a prime example of a good one. It has a decently thought out plot and the characters do have depth. here\u2019s some evidence to back that last claim up:\n\n\u2014 Sasori\u2019s character is stemmed from the death of his parents. this leads him to gaining interest in the concept of immortality, which he attempted to achieve through the creation of puppets (think \u2018mother and father\u2019 and \u2018sasori\u2019s human puppet\u2019). when fighting against the mother and father puppets controlled by his grandmother, his confidence dwindles down and he realizes he will never truly be immortal. he allows himself to die in an attack he\u2019d already anticipated. later in the war arc, he is revived and battles Kankuro, who is controlling Sasori\u2019s human puppet. Sasori asks that his puppets be handed down from generation to generation, and dies again. sasori\u2019s a pretty insignificant character in the grand scheme of things (not to say he wasn\u2019t interesting!) and even he\u2019s a character with depth. \n\n\u2014 Itachi. I read both books of Itachi\u2019s Story so I have a little more information on him. He started out as a prodigy to the Uchiha clan, who were upset that they were being discriminated against in Konoha. After seeing the results of the Ninja War at a young age, he dreams to rid the world of all violence. He was very serious about that dream. after graduating at the top of his class, he became a genin and gained an early promotion to chunin and aims to be the first uchiha hokage. the uchiha begin plotting a coup d\u2019etat, and urge Itachi to join the anbu to gain intel. itachi becomes a double agent to try and appease both konoha and the uchiha clan. he\u2019s eventually given an ultimatum by Danzo\u2014 kill the uchiha clan and spare your brother or die with the whole clan. itachi, following his dream of peace, eliminates the clan with the help of Obito. the third hokage promises to protect sasuke and asks where itachi will go. itachi says he will join the akatsuki and keep tabs on them to help protect konoha. this is where his story arc starts and the rest you already know from the series. he doesn\u2019t necessarily have a good story arc, as i think that the way Itachi is portrayed to be a genius, he could have found another way, especially after Shisui wanted him to protect the clan and stop the Coup at the same time. \n\nanother example of a good one is tokyo ghoul. the story\u2019s really fucked up but it\u2019s good for a horror-type anime. the whole start of the story is that Kaneki is prayed on by a woman he\u2019s been pining over, and it turns out that she\u2019s a ghoul (human-like creatures who only find sustenance in eating human flesh) and attempts to eat him after luring him to an alley known for ghoul attacks (she faked that she lived there and was scared to go alone to lure him there). large metal beams end up falling on her and killed her. kaneki is nearly killed but he is rushed to a hospital where the ghoul\u2019s organs are transplanted into his body, making him a half ghoul. it\u2019s interesting to watch him struggle to accept this fact and embrace it as the story progresses. \n\nand death note. death note is good in ways i can\u2019t begin to explain to you. death note is about a brilliant college student finding a death note, a notebook in which you can write the name of anyone and they will die. the situations that Light (the main character) is put in as a result of his power trip with the death note is incredible and keeps you on the edge of your seat. the way he figures out secrets about the death note and how he can manipulate the rules of it are always interesting to see. each character makes waves in the story, no character is just thrown in for the sake of being there. L, for example. he\u2019s the main secret investigator in the Kira case trying to track down Light. the things that L figures out and how he discovers them make him a good foil to Light. there are many other factors that make this anime one of the best out there.\n\ni would say Attack on Titan is a good one, but it seems too basic to me. it\u2019s got an interesting storyline but it\u2019s basically a glorified version of The Walking Dead, but with a few twists here and there. I got bored of it when they started looking for Eren\u2019s basement so i can\u2019t really talk about that one very much.",

                    "body": "that\u2019s just you being blind and biased. do you just not like anime in general because there ARE some pretty good ones. here\u2019s an example of three popular anime:\n\nNaruto is a prime example of a good one. It has a decently thought out plot and the characters do have depth. here\u2019s some evidence to back that last claim up:\n\n\u2014 Sasori\u2019s character is stemmed from the death of his parents. this leads him to gaining interest in the concept of immortality, which he attempted to achieve through the creation of puppets (think \u2018mother and father\u2019 and \u2018sasori\u2019s human puppet\u2019). when fighting against the mother and father puppets controlled by his grandmother, his confidence dwindles down and he realizes he will never truly be immortal. he allows himself to die in an attack he\u2019d already anticipated. later in the war arc, he is revived and battles Kankuro, who is controlling Sasori\u2019s human puppet. Sasori asks that his puppets be handed down from generation to generation, and dies again. sasori\u2019s a pretty insignificant character in the grand scheme of things (not to say he wasn\u2019t interesting!) and even he\u2019s a character with depth. \n\n\u2014 Itachi. I read both books of Itachi\u2019s Story so I have a little more information on him. He started out as a prodigy to the Uchiha clan, who were upset that they were being discriminated against in Konoha. After seeing the results of the Ninja War at a young age, he dreams to rid the world of all violence. He was very serious about that dream. after graduating at the top of his class, he became a genin and gained an early promotion to chunin and aims to be the first uchiha hokage. the uchiha begin plotting a coup d\u2019etat, and urge Itachi to join the anbu to gain intel. itachi becomes a double agent to try and appease both konoha and the uchiha clan. he\u2019s eventually given an ultimatum by Danzo\u2014 kill the uchiha clan and spare your brother or die with the whole clan. itachi, following his dream of peace, eliminates the clan with the help of Obito. the third hokage promises to protect sasuke and asks where itachi will go. itachi says he will join the akatsuki and keep tabs on them to help protect konoha. this is where his story arc starts and the rest you already know from the series. he doesn\u2019t necessarily have a good story arc, as i think that the way Itachi is portrayed to be a genius, he could have found another way, especially after Shisui wanted him to protect the clan and stop the Coup at the same time. \n\nanother example of a good one is tokyo ghoul. the story\u2019s really fucked up but it\u2019s good for a horror-type anime. the whole start of the story is that Kaneki is prayed on by a woman he\u2019s been pining over, and it turns out that she\u2019s a ghoul (human-like creatures who only find sustenance in eating human flesh) and attempts to eat him after luring him to an alley known for ghoul attacks (she faked that she lived there and was scared to go alone to lure him there). large metal beams end up falling on her and killed her. kaneki is nearly killed but he is rushed to a hospital where the ghoul\u2019s organs are transplanted into his body, making him a half ghoul. it\u2019s interesting to watch him struggle to accept this fact and embrace it as the story progresses. \n\nand death note. death note is good in ways i can\u2019t begin to explain to you. death note is about a brilliant college student finding a death note, a notebook in which you can write the name of anyone and they will die. the situations that Light (the main character) is put in as a result of his power trip with the death note is incredible and keeps you on the edge of your seat. the way he figures out secrets about the death note and how he can manipulate the rules of it are always interesting to see. each character makes waves in the story, no character is just thrown in for the sake of being there. L, for example. he\u2019s the main secret investigator in the Kira case trying to track down Light. the things that L figures out and how he discovers them make him a good foil to Light. there are many other factors that make this anime one of the best out there.\n\ni would say Attack on Titan is a good one, but it seems too basic to me. it\u2019s got an interesting storyline but it\u2019s basically a glorified version of The Walking Dead, but with a few twists here and there. I got bored of it when they started looking for Eren\u2019s basement so i can\u2019t really talk about that one very much.",

            "body": "that\u2019s just you being blind and biased. do you just not like anime in general because there ARE some pretty good ones. here\u2019s an example of three popular anime:\n\nNaruto is a prime example of a good one. It has a decently thought out plot and the characters do have depth. here\u2019s some evidence to back that last claim up:\n\n\u2014 Sasori\u2019s character is stemmed from the death of his parents. this leads him to gaining interest in the concept of immortality, which he attempted to achieve through the creation of puppets (think \u2018mother and father\u2019 and \u2018sasori\u2019s human puppet\u2019). when fighting against the mother and father puppets controlled by his grandmother, his confidence dwindles down and he realizes he will never truly be immortal. he allows himself to die in an attack he\u2019d already anticipated. later in the war arc, he is revived and battles Kankuro, who is controlling Sasori\u2019s human puppet. Sasori asks that his puppets be handed down from generation to generation, and dies again. sasori\u2019s a pretty insignificant character in the grand scheme of things (not to say he wasn\u2019t interesting!) and even he\u2019s a character with depth. \n\n\u2014 Itachi. I read both books of Itachi\u2019s Story so I have a little more information on him. He started out as a prodigy to the Uchiha clan, who were upset that they were being discriminated against in Konoha. After seeing the results of the Ninja War at a young age, he dreams to rid the world of all violence. He was very serious about that dream. after graduating at the top of his class, he became a genin and gained an early promotion to chunin and aims to be the first uchiha hokage. the uchiha begin plotting a coup d\u2019etat, and urge Itachi to join the anbu to gain intel. itachi becomes a double agent to try and appease both konoha and the uchiha clan. he\u2019s eventually given an ultimatum by Danzo\u2014 kill the uchiha clan and spare your brother or die with the whole clan. itachi, following his dream of peace, eliminates the clan with the help of Obito. the third hokage promises to protect sasuke and asks where itachi will go. itachi says he will join the akatsuki and keep tabs on them to help protect konoha. this is where his story arc starts and the rest you already know from the series. he doesn\u2019t necessarily have a good story arc, as i think that the way Itachi is portrayed to be a genius, he could have found another way, especially after Shisui wanted him to protect the clan and stop the Coup at the same time. \n\nanother example of a good one is tokyo ghoul. the story\u2019s really fucked up but it\u2019s good for a horror-type anime. the whole start of the story is that Kaneki is prayed on by a woman he\u2019s been pining over, and it turns out that she\u2019s a ghoul (human-like creatures who only find sustenance in eating human flesh) and attempts to eat him after luring him to an alley known for ghoul attacks (she faked that she lived there and was scared to go alone to lure him there). large metal beams end up falling on her and killed her. kaneki is nearly killed but he is rushed to a hospital where the ghoul\u2019s organs are transplanted into his body, making him a half ghoul. it\u2019s interesting to watch him struggle to accept this fact and embrace it as the story progresses. \n\nand death note. death note is good in ways i can\u2019t begin to explain to you. death note is about a brilliant college student finding a death note, a notebook in which you can write the name of anyone and they will die. the situations that Light (the main character) is put in as a result of his power trip with the death note is incredible and keeps you on the edge of your seat. the way he figures out secrets about the death note and how he can manipulate the rules of it are always interesting to see. each character makes waves in the story, no character is just thrown in for the sake of being there. L, for example. he\u2019s the main secret investigator in the Kira case trying to track down Light. the things that L figures out and how he discovers them make him a good foil to Light. there are many other factors that make this anime one of the best out there.\n\ni would say Attack on Titan is a good one, but it seems too basic to me. it\u2019s got an interesting storyline but it\u2019s basically a glorified version of The Walking Dead, but with a few twists here and there. I got bored of it when they started looking for Eren\u2019s basement so i can\u2019t really talk about that one very much.",
