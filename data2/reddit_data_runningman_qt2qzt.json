But like you said, there isn\u2019t anything wrong even if she was. However, I\u2019d personally hesitate to equate one with the other. To me, it seems like a possible new trend - with Gummy (singer) recently also sporting a similarly short hairstyle. Also, she has recently done treatments to her hair (dyeing it red and then back to black for TWD), which is known to not be the best for hair health so there could be a variety of unrelated reason for her decision. Regardless of her reason, I think it looks good on her and hopefully she is content with it. \ud83d\ude0a",

But like you said, there isn\u2019t anything wrong even if she was. However, I\u2019d personally hesitate to equate one with the other. To me, it seems like a possible new trend - with Gummy (singer) recently also sporting a similarly short hairstyle. Also, she has recently done treatments to her hair (dyeing it red and then back to black for TWD), which is known to not be the best for hair health so there could be a variety of unrelated reason for her decision. Regardless of her reason, I think it looks good on her and hopefully she is content with it. \ud83d\ude0a",

However, I\u2019d personally hesitate to equate one with the other. To me, it seems like a possible new trend - with Gummy (singer) recently also sporting a similarly short hairstyle. Also, she has recently done treatments to her hair (dyeing it red and then back to black for TWD), which is known to not be the best for hair health so there could be a variety of unrelated reason for her decision. Regardless of her reason, I think it looks good on her and hopefully she is content with it. \ud83d\ude0a",
