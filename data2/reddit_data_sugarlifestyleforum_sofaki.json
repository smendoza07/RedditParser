    "body": "Recently, some girl made a post on this forum asking for advice on how to land a sugar daddy that she doesn't have to sleep with, spend time with, talk to, or even think about, but will pay her handsomely. Needless to say, she didn't get a lot of positive feedback.\n\nThanks to Tik Tok and YouTube, any girl that wants a pair of red bottoms bought for her by rich, lonely losers is in luck! Old, creepy men are lining up around the block for the opportunity to stuff your bank account just to talk to you, or pay your way thru college for the privilege of taking you to dinner. Any girl willing to send these geezers a few texts can become a pampered princess from the comfort of her couch.\n\nAnd because everything on the internet is true, these girls find their way to this forum and ask for advice on how to land a whale by doing the bare minimum. Do they REALLY have to meet with these men, much less sleep with them? Why don't any of them want a platonic relationship? \n\nWell sweetie, why don't you want to be paid with Monopoly money? Because it's not real. If these guys are giving you money, they want the real thing. Real dates. Real conversation. And yes, real intimacy. \n\nBeing a sugar baby, a REAL sugar baby, is similar to having any other relationship. You have to put in some effort. You have to care. You have to be into the person, or at least be able to keep up the illusion that you are. \n\nA lot of these men are here because they aren't getting the attention they used to at home, and they are looking for you to provide it. Some of them want to have pretty arm candy. Some of them want to mentor young minds. Whatever reason they are here, you can bet it's not to send cash to some random, entitled princess who thinks she deserves money because she exists. \n\nGranted, you may be used to getting your way because you're pretty. But your good looks are bare minimum in the Bowl. You are competing against dozens of other women who are just as pretty but are also smart and funny and interesting and ambitious. Your looks can't help you now. You might get pumped and dumped and earn a few hundred bucks, but you can't have the personality of a toaster if you want to remain a SB long term. \n\nMy suggestion? If you're not ready to actually meet these men, or the idea of even talking to them creeps you out, start an OnlyFans account, and let the true gamers participate in the Sugar Bowl. You don't belong here.\n\nEDIT: For clarification purposes, I am a successful, currently active sugar baby. I'm not a jaded SD, or a bitter SB who couldn't land a partner. I made this post because I'm sick of these girls ruining the Bowl for the people who know what it's all about.",

The simps as we call them.  These are the kinds of men that are so desperate for female attention that they will send their last dollar to some girl they have never met online for the slightest bit of attention.\n\nHere is the thing though, these guys are not the same guys that become sugar daddies.  Those type of guys are typically very low value not to mention broke.   Sugar daddies have options.  Myself for example, even if I wasn't into being a sugar daddy, I could afford to hit up the massage parlor or escorts every day of the week if I really wanted to.  I don't need to venmo some girl online money just to send me a few pictures.\n\nIt's ridiculous to think that any man that has the means to be a sugar daddy would ever settle for an online relationship or even a platonic one.  And I think that most sugar daddies that have been in the game a while are pretty good at filtering these girls out so I agree with you they really don't belong here at all.",

Almost 40 years ago before cell phone and internet I liked \"entertaining\" older women as a teenage boy. I actually was with more older women than girls my own age. The thought of being \"sugared\" never crossed my mind. One of the married women told her husband and he was completely fine with it. His job required that he would be out of the house for months at a time and she wanted her needs met. For him he knew that I wasn't in a position to replace him in all aspects of a relationship that all I was doing was being slightly better than a dildo. I wasn't sugared or taken care of on Day 1. Some time went by and she helped me get that first job making four times minimum wage part time plus a full benefits package that I paid nothing for, plus she provided \"referrals.\" My girlfriend's mom found out what I was doing and she wanted me to \"entertain\" her too. My girlfriend's mom then confessed to her daughter and my girlfriend got mad at me because I wasn't honest with her and got another boyfriend but didn't want to stop being with me and her mom didn't want me to stop entertaining her either. I explained to my ex girlfriend the whole thing and she got into the lifestyle and broke up with her boyfriend and started calling me her boyfriend again. I eventually moved away to another state. That's when everything fell apart because without face time there's nothing. I had to make a deal breaker rule that I wouldn't do anything with someone who was married unless the husband or boyfriend approved. I never asked for anything but if someone wanted to \"sweeten\" me by some type of assistance in life such as providing advice or help open a door for me they got pushed to the front of the line. One couple who were at the time not married brought me in to entertain and they later indicated that they were no longer interested. No hard feelings. No problem. Understand completely. I remained friends with them and kept it a secret per their request for decades. Every time I see them they just smile and we crack jokes. She's in her 70's now and he is in his 80's. I had to do everything organically in the wild 40 years ago and relied on referrals. I'm just bewildered about how it works now.   Thank you for sharing your thoughts on the world. It made me smile.",

During the lockdown when i struggled as an SB, i could see seeking getting flooded with so many girls (so called SB) offering virtual show or promoting their onlyfans or even make a private video. At the same time, there was a large group of new SDs (so called SD) who came online looking for one time fucking date in return for some money.\n\nTo everyone, it is not easy to be an SB and keep up with it. There are lot of challenges for an SB, i believe more than a normal relationship but we try to keep up because of the benefits from an SR compared to normal relation. We have to always be in shape, look sexy as that is the first criteria for majority of the SDs to screen a potential SB. Once we have cleared that filter, we need to take care of our skin and other body details so that SDs find us attractive in bed too, let alone how we satisfy and fulfill all the different desires which gets shared with us. Well, it is not just about looks and sex. I have in past and now as well, tried to understand what my SD does, how does his typical day look like and read stuff related to his field of work so i can hold a meaningful conversation with him. Once that is taken care of, a true SD will always like to know my ambition, how that plan is going and a regular update on that. So like a homework, i have to have my A game there as well.\n\nIt is not an effortless arrangement but something where you need to put effort. Because if you don't there are 100 more SBs ready to take your place and SD won't blink an eye if he can't find that spark with you.",

SDs are out numbered at least 10 to 1, at least.

We do not like online only / platonic here, and we say as much. We also frown down on straight up escorting and the pros and johns that partake in that. \n\nThis sub is about real sugar RELATIONSHIPS, and people seeking them out or are currently in them. Real relationships, especially ones where a well-to-do man is providing help for a younger woman (in most cases) do involve intimacy. But that's not all that a sugar relationship entails. There are differing shades of the sugar spectrum, some more quid-pro-quo type relationships are almost essentially just being a regular john / escort, but maybe at a lower volume, all the way up to things like what I have, which is essentially a vanilla boyfriend and girlfriend situation where I just help her out here and there but nothing set in stone, and all of that. And anything and everything in between. But the common denominator is having a real adult relationship / arrangement, which includes doing adult things, such as sex. Anything that goes against that grain, like platonic / online only, is not welcome here. Then again if all it is about is just sex, and one offs, or high volume, that encroaches on pro / john behavior which is also not welcome here.\n\nGet it?\n\nBut again, to dispel any myths and or misinterpretations you may have, SLF is NOT an all inclusive community for any type of dynamics between two or more people. We are a SUGAR community, one that is rooted in reality and in having real adult relationships.",

                    "body": "OP your post and comments made me chuckle. Not laughing at you, just the overall situation and life in general. Almost 40 years ago before cell phone and internet I liked \"entertaining\" older women as a teenage boy. I actually was with more older women than girls my own age. The thought of being \"sugared\" never crossed my mind. One of the married women told her husband and he was completely fine with it. His job required that he would be out of the house for months at a time and she wanted her needs met. For him he knew that I wasn't in a position to replace him in all aspects of a relationship that all I was doing was being slightly better than a dildo. I wasn't sugared or taken care of on Day 1. Some time went by and she helped me get that first job making four times minimum wage part time plus a full benefits package that I paid nothing for, plus she provided \"referrals.\" My girlfriend's mom found out what I was doing and she wanted me to \"entertain\" her too. My girlfriend's mom then confessed to her daughter and my girlfriend got mad at me because I wasn't honest with her and got another boyfriend but didn't want to stop being with me and her mom didn't want me to stop entertaining her either. I explained to my ex girlfriend the whole thing and she got into the lifestyle and broke up with her boyfriend and started calling me her boyfriend again. I eventually moved away to another state. That's when everything fell apart because without face time there's nothing. I had to make a deal breaker rule that I wouldn't do anything with someone who was married unless the husband or boyfriend approved. I never asked for anything but if someone wanted to \"sweeten\" me by some type of assistance in life such as providing advice or help open a door for me they got pushed to the front of the line. One couple who were at the time not married brought me in to entertain and they later indicated that they were no longer interested. No hard feelings. No problem. Understand completely. I remained friends with them and kept it a secret per their request for decades. Every time I see them they just smile and we crack jokes. She's in her 70's now and he is in his 80's. I had to do everything organically in the wild 40 years ago and relied on referrals. I'm just bewildered about how it works now.   Thank you for sharing your thoughts on the world. It made me smile.",

Two. And they are literally the two most beautiful women I\u2019ve ever seen anywhere, including film/TV. \n\nBoth are just insanely attractive, naughty enough to be willing to do pics/vids, truly fun to just chat with (which all parties enjoy, no money required) but draw a hard line at having sex. I continue doing it only because it\u2019s a small amount of money, the girls are just THAT hot, they\u2019re fun to talk to and be friends with, and maybe there\u2019s a 0.00001% chance one of them will change their mind at some point lol. \n\nBut this isn\u2019t possible for most girls, not does it net much money. Most girls simply aren\u2019t attractive enough to pull this off. I\u2019d never pay for pics from your average 9 or even 10 level girl. It takes something truly exceptional to pull it off. Off the number scale.",

We do not like online only / platonic here, and we say as much. We also frown down on straight up escorting and the pros and johns that partake in that. \n\nThis sub is about real sugar RELATIONSHIPS, and people seeking them out or are currently in them. Real relationships, especially ones where a well-to-do man is providing help for a younger woman (in most cases) do involve intimacy. But that's not all that a sugar relationship entails. There are differing shades of the sugar spectrum, some more quid-pro-quo type relationships are almost essentially just being a regular john / escort, but maybe at a lower volume, all the way up to things like what I have, which is essentially a vanilla boyfriend and girlfriend situation where I just help her out here and there but nothing set in stone, and all of that. And anything and everything in between. But the common denominator is having a real adult relationship / arrangement, which includes doing adult things, such as sex. Anything that goes against that grain, like platonic / online only, is not welcome here. Then again if all it is about is just sex, and one offs, or high volume, that encroaches on pro / john behavior which is also not welcome here.\n\nGet it?\n\nBut again, to dispel any myths and or misinterpretations you may have, SLF is NOT an all inclusive community for any type of dynamics between two or more people. We are a SUGAR community, one that is rooted in reality and in having real adult relationships.",

Almost 40 years ago before cell phone and internet I liked \"entertaining\" older women as a teenage boy. I actually was with more older women than girls my own age. The thought of being \"sugared\" never crossed my mind. One of the married women told her husband and he was completely fine with it. His job required that he would be out of the house for months at a time and she wanted her needs met. For him he knew that I wasn't in a position to replace him in all aspects of a relationship that all I was doing was being slightly better than a dildo. I wasn't sugared or taken care of on Day 1. Some time went by and she helped me get that first job making four times minimum wage part time plus a full benefits package that I paid nothing for, plus she provided \"referrals.\" My girlfriend's mom found out what I was doing and she wanted me to \"entertain\" her too. My girlfriend's mom then confessed to her daughter and my girlfriend got mad at me because I wasn't honest with her and got another boyfriend but didn't want to stop being with me and her mom didn't want me to stop entertaining her either. I explained to my ex girlfriend the whole thing and she got into the lifestyle and broke up with her boyfriend and started calling me her boyfriend again. I eventually moved away to another state. That's when everything fell apart because without face time there's nothing. I had to make a deal breaker rule that I wouldn't do anything with someone who was married unless the husband or boyfriend approved. I never asked for anything but if someone wanted to \"sweeten\" me by some type of assistance in life such as providing advice or help open a door for me they got pushed to the front of the line. One couple who were at the time not married brought me in to entertain and they later indicated that they were no longer interested. No hard feelings. No problem. Understand completely. I remained friends with them and kept it a secret per their request for decades. Every time I see them they just smile and we crack jokes. She's in her 70's now and he is in his 80's. I had to do everything organically in the wild 40 years ago and relied on referrals. I'm just bewildered about how it works now.   Thank you for sharing your thoughts on the world. It made me smile.",

I continue doing it only because it\u2019s a small amount of money, the girls are just THAT hot, they\u2019re fun to talk to and be friends with, and maybe there\u2019s a 0.00001% chance one of them will change their mind at some point lol. \n\nBut this isn\u2019t possible for most girls, not does it net much money. Most girls simply aren\u2019t attractive enough to pull this off. I\u2019d never pay for pics from your average 9 or even 10 level girl. It takes something truly exceptional to pull it off.

We do not like online only / platonic here, and we say as much. We also frown down on straight up escorting and the pros and johns that partake in that. \n\nThis sub is about real sugar RELATIONSHIPS, and people seeking them out or are currently in them. Real relationships, especially ones where a well-to-do man is providing help for a younger woman (in most cases) do involve intimacy. But that's not all that a sugar relationship entails. There are differing shades of the sugar spectrum, some more quid-pro-quo type relationships are almost essentially just being a regular john / escort, but maybe at a lower volume, all the way up to things like what I have, which is essentially a vanilla boyfriend and girlfriend situation where I just help her out here and there but nothing set in stone, and all of that. And anything and everything in between. But the common denominator is having a real adult relationship / arrangement, which includes doing adult things, such as sex. Anything that goes against that grain, like platonic / online only, is not welcome here. Then again if all it is about is just sex, and one offs, or high volume, that encroaches on pro / john behavior which is also not welcome here.\n\nGet it?\n\nBut again, to dispel any myths and or misinterpretations you may have, SLF is NOT an all inclusive community for any type of dynamics between two or more people. We are a SUGAR community, one that is rooted in reality and in having real adult relationships.",

We do not like online only / platonic here, and we say as much. We also frown down on straight up escorting and the pros and johns that partake in that. \n\nThis sub is about real sugar RELATIONSHIPS, and people seeking them out or are currently in them. Real relationships, especially ones where a well-to-do man is providing help for a younger woman (in most cases) do involve intimacy. But that's not all that a sugar relationship entails. There are differing shades of the sugar spectrum, some more quid-pro-quo type relationships are almost essentially just being a regular john / escort, but maybe at a lower volume, all the way up to things like what I have, which is essentially a vanilla boyfriend and girlfriend situation where I just help her out here and there but nothing set in stone, and all of that. And anything and everything in between. But the common denominator is having a real adult relationship / arrangement, which includes doing adult things, such as sex. Anything that goes against that grain, like platonic / online only, is not welcome here. Then again if all it is about is just sex, and one offs, or high volume, that encroaches on pro / john behavior which is also not welcome here.\n\nGet it?\n\nBut again, to dispel any myths and or misinterpretations you may have, SLF is NOT an all inclusive community for any type of dynamics between two or more people. We are a SUGAR community, one that is rooted in reality and in having real adult relationships.",

But don't be all butt hurt that the majority of people on this forum don't agree with your views. If you want to be taken seriously, little girl, learn the rules of the game before you play.",

We have already established that I have nothing better to do while I'm at my 8 to 5... but what's your excuse? If you were half as successful as you're trying to convey, you'd have said your piece and gone on hustling. But no, here you are trying to get in the last word because a bored stranger rubbed you the wrong way. You're so see thru you're transparent. \n\nAnd stay if you like. I can't make you leave. But don't be all butt hurt that the majority of people on this forum don't agree with your views. If you want to be taken seriously, little girl, learn the rules of the game before you play.",
