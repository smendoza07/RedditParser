                    "body": "So i only got to watching the original naruto series around last year (i wasn't allowed a lot of tv as a kid, so it was pretty unfamiliar to me) but with the pandemic lockdowns, my fiance and i decided to enjoy weekend nights smoking weed and watching naruto. When we get to episode 117 where Neji is fighting Kidomaru and that scene where it looks like he definitely is going to be dead... And it's really worked up to make it seem like he's dead, and my stoned-ass fiance goes \"oh no! Neji is Dedji!\" and i just could not stop laughing. My stoned-ass legit thought he was dead, but the joke was too fucking funny to me. But then he ended up fine, so Dedji was only funny for the moment. \n\nBut then i watched shippuden, and Neji actually became Dedji. While it was pretty sad and overall a pretty emotional experience, I honestly can't not crack up at how the legacy or Dedji came full circle.",

Later my best friend, who has now passed away, met my gf at the time, he told her that she should watch Naruto with me while high to get close to me. She was Japanese so to her the idea of watching a kids cartoon from her home country with her boyfriend didn\u2019t seem romantic in the least. Later we broke up - Obviously - but after my best friend passed away, she offered to watch Naruto with me. 8 years later we are married with 3 kids. Now we watch anime, marvel series, and lots of shonen-esque things together.",

Then his tolerance went through the roof and he started bangin that shit. \nNext thing you know his training plan took a backseat as all he cares about now is his next fix. It\u2019s been years since he\u2019s even attempted opening a single gate and honestly the amount of chakra he produces for even the first gate would probably kill him.

When we get to episode 117 where Neji is fighting Kidomaru and that scene where it looks like he definitely is going to be dead... And it's really worked up to make it seem like he's dead, and my stoned-ass fiance goes \"oh no! Neji is Dedji!\" and i just could not stop laughing. My stoned-ass legit thought he was dead, but the joke was too fucking funny to me. But then he ended up fine, so Dedji was only funny for the moment. \n\nBut then i watched shippuden, and Neji actually became Dedji. While it was pretty sad and overall a pretty emotional experience, I honestly can't not crack up at how the legacy or Dedji came full circle.",

Later we broke up - Obviously - but after my best friend passed away, she offered to watch Naruto with me. 8 years later we are married with 3 kids.

Then after a couple months the side effects started to take hold. Lack of nutrition stripped him of muscle mass and the poor diet led to poor health overall. By then he was addicted though he wouldn\u2019t admit it. Then his tolerance went through the roof and he started bangin that shit. \nNext thing you know his training plan took a backseat as all he cares about now is his next fix. It\u2019s been years since he\u2019s even attempted opening a single gate and honestly the amount of chakra he produces for even the first gate would probably kill him. Kishimoto really nerfed the old gen. He ain\u2019t had to go that far on our boy Lee.",

She was Japanese so to her the idea of watching a kids cartoon from her home country with her boyfriend didn\u2019t seem romantic in the least. Later we broke up - Obviously - but after my best friend passed away, she offered to watch Naruto with me. 8 years later we are married with 3 kids.
