His mental state was distracted therefore he couldn\u2019t go all out as stated by naruto when you\u2019re mental state is not at the best you can\u2019t use chakra properly. Chakra has also been explained to have mental energy. Hiruzen was also old and was losing stamina quickly and was holding back to the point even emna picked  and told him and he said he knows and apologizes. Then when hiruzen gets serious his mere shadow clones Blizt them. 1. The edo\u2019s was blood lust and trying to kill him while hiruzen is nerf, why are you using a nerf hiruzen. To then downplay him in prime, no prime hiruzen is already stated more times then hasirama was to be the strongest, and it\u2019s his narrative  to be the student of both to grow up and eventually surpass his masters. Trying to pen prime Tobirama and hasirama bloodlusted vs a old hiruzen who is holding back smh then use that to downplay",

In One Piece it makes sense because in the New World you're either with the emperors or constantly fighting against them (and who can survive against that)\n\nFor Naruto why did the first and second Hokage not end all wars if they're literally the strongest people on the planet? Why are they even the strongest Hokage when Jutsus if anything should get stronger overtime?\n\nNaruto does have better fights IMO than One Piece, but I do think OP is superior in almost every other aspect.",

Take away all his position, abolished that root anbu place, burned all their files, released all the children he kidnapped, took all the root anbu and make them into black anbu, and make sure they won't betray the village,  put him in prison for all his mistakes. That's what \"love\" is. Don't wait till he make the second mistake or third or fourth etc to stop him. It's not about him-hiruzen-as the hokage, it's about the good people and kids in that village.\n\nAnd if he refused to stop, fight him like how naruto fought sasuke for planning his revolution and planning to kill those hokage or those who defy him!!!

Before they could lend aid, however, they received instructions from Konoha's leadership to patrol Konoha's borders instead, a sign that, even in the middle of an attack, the village already suspected an Uchiha was responsible; just as the Sharingan could be used to stop the Nine-Tails, so too could it cause the Nine-Tails' attack in the first place. Fugaku once again complied with the orders without comment. In the aftermath of the attack, the Uchiha clan were relocated to a compound along the village's outskirts on the pretext of it being a necessary step in Konoha's reconstruction.*\n\n>When he was aware of the threat of a civil war, he said he wanted to talk to the Uchiha, but he did not do shit. He forbid Danzo to take actions (which did not stop him, no control whatsoever over his subordinates) but he didn't take any action at all.\n\nThat's a legit point too BUT Hiruzen actually punished Danzo : Because Danz\u014d acted without his consent, the Third removed Danz\u014d from the council and officially (not totally) disbanded the Root organisation.",

Chakra has also been explained to have mental energy. Hiruzen was also old and was losing stamina quickly and was holding back to the point even emna picked  and told him and he said he knows and apologizes. Then when hiruzen gets serious his mere shadow clones Blizt them. 1. The edo\u2019s was blood lust and trying to kill him while hiruzen is nerf, why are you using a nerf hiruzen. To then downplay him in prime, no prime hiruzen is already stated more times then hasirama was to be the strongest, and it\u2019s his narrative  to be the student of both to grow up and eventually surpass his masters. Trying to pen prime Tobirama and hasirama bloodlusted vs a old hiruzen who is holding back smh then use that to downplay",

In One Piece it makes sense because in the New World you're either with the emperors or constantly fighting against them (and who can survive against that)\n\nFor Naruto why did the first and second Hokage not end all wars if they're literally the strongest people on the planet? Why are they even the strongest Hokage when Jutsus if anything should get stronger overtime?\n\nNaruto does have better fights IMO than One Piece, but I do think OP is superior in almost every other aspect.",

Before they could lend aid, however, they received instructions from Konoha's leadership to patrol Konoha's borders instead, a sign that, even in the middle of an attack, the village already suspected an Uchiha was responsible; just as the Sharingan could be used to stop the Nine-Tails, so too could it cause the Nine-Tails' attack in the first place. Fugaku once again complied with the orders without comment. In the aftermath of the attack, the Uchiha clan were relocated to a compound along the village's outskirts on the pretext of it being a necessary step in Konoha's reconstruction.*\n\n>When he was aware of the threat of a civil war, he said he wanted to talk to the Uchiha, but he did not do shit. He forbid Danzo to take actions (which did not stop him, no control whatsoever over his subordinates) but he didn't take any action at all.\n\nThat's a legit point too BUT Hiruzen actually punished Danzo : Because Danz\u014d acted without his consent, the Third removed Danz\u014d from the council and officially (not totally) disbanded the Root organisation.",

In One Piece it makes sense because in the New World you're either with the emperors or constantly fighting against them (and who can survive against that)\n\nFor Naruto why did the first and second Hokage not end all wars if they're literally the strongest people on the planet?

In One Piece it makes sense because in the New World you're either with the emperors or constantly fighting against them (and who can survive against that)\n\nFor Naruto why did the first and second Hokage not end all wars if they're literally the strongest people on the planet? Why are they even the strongest Hokage when Jutsus if anything should get stronger overtime?\n\nNaruto does have better fights IMO than One Piece, but I do think OP is superior in almost every other aspect.",

But I can't say I'm mad that he lived. I don't think him being hokage was out of place - he was the only one respected and capable enough for the job (knowing Shikaku Nara had died). \n\nThe honorable death in the series stands as Jiraya. Though, Guy should be dead. Opening the 8th gate shouldn't be cheaped out the way it was.",

In One Piece it makes sense because in the New World you're either with the emperors or constantly fighting against them (and who can survive against that)\n\nFor Naruto why did the first and second Hokage not end all wars if they're literally the strongest people on the planet? Why are they even the strongest Hokage when Jutsus if anything should get stronger overtime?\n\nNaruto does have better fights IMO than One Piece, but I do think OP is superior in almost every other aspect.",

In One Piece it makes sense because in the New World you're either with the emperors or constantly fighting against them (and who can survive against that)\n\nFor Naruto why did the first and second Hokage not end all wars if they're literally the strongest people on the planet? Why are they even the strongest Hokage when Jutsus if anything should get stronger overtime?\n\nNaruto does have better fights IMO than One Piece, but I do think OP is superior in almost every other aspect.",

The OP anime doesn't do the story justice imo, but that's about the only thing that's holding it back. \nOn a related note, there are a lot of similarities between my hero academia and early Naruto (pre-shippuden, when it was still good lol), but the main difference being Horikoshi is a far superior writer compared to Kishimoto. If things continue like they are now, my hero academia will completely eclipse Naruto in a decade or two, if not already.",
