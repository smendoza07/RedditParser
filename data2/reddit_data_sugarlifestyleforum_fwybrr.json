I don\u2019t speak to women interested in platonic. \n\nI don\u2019t generally approach women on SA in the first place. That\u2019s usually quite opposite of my experience on SA. Generally, women approach me. When they approach me with an \u201conline only GFE\u201d proposal, they usually get flagged and blocked. I\u2019m guessing they wouldn\u2019t find it amusing if I sent them pictures of cash, as other have postulated. \n\nI find it ironic that someone who\u2019s handle is \u201can actual hooker\u201d is berating me for actually wanting a physical relationship.\n\nI\u2019m not trolling anyone madam, and I don\u2019t feed the trolls either.
