Truth is, I haven't cared much about my receding hairline anymore.\n\nI've had this since I was 17 or 18. I'm 24 now and it hasn't changed at all. Thought back then I couldn't have nice hair or care about hair styling because I thought at the start that I was pretty much fucked. Then thought I was fucked twice because I had a really pronounced widow's peak as a kid and with a receding hairline this made it even worse in my eyes back then.\n\nBut with a proper diet which I've started already to lose weight, some good quality products (some use DHT-blocking shampoos, Minoxidil but I haven't touched it so far) and a suiting haircut you can always make it better than worse and worse.\n\nI'm super happy with my hairstyle atm and I didn't succumb to this obsession over receding hairlines. Some post pictures up here that are more like a maturing hairline or a completely fine one. Even if the damage is done once you might start taking more care about your hair, you can still rock some really solid hair.",
