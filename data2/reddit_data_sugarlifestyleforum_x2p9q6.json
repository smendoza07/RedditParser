    "body": "I\u2019ve been in the bowl for 6 years and have had my fair share of allowances and conversations. I\u2019ve have mid range to xx,xxx ones. \n\n\u201cHow do I bring up the conversation?\u201d\n\u201cHow do I talk to a whale about this?\u201d\n\nThe answer is so simple, YOU ASK. Closed mouths do not get fed. \n\nYou met on a site where financial compensation is part of the relationship, if he doesn\u2019t bring it up MAKE SURE YOU DO because then we\u2019ll get the post,\n\u201cMy POT didn\u2019t pay me and I already slept with him because he said, blah blah blah..:\u201d \n\nIf a POT/SD doesn\u2019t bring it up in the initial messages, I\u2019ll go on a full blown date with the guy. (No financial expectations to meet\u2026 obviously) hell, it may not come up over dinner\u2026 usually it does though and if it doesn\u2019t then you TEXT him. \n\u201cHey, I had an amazing time with you, I\u2019d love to move forward and talk expectations*\u201d key word. You\u2019ve opened up the conversation. If he agrees, then literally say what you want. \n\n\u201cLooking for a genuine connection where we go to dinner, activities, (the obvious) meet relatively once a week. My allowances that I\u2019ve had in the past usually range from x to x, if that works for you, great! If not, I wish you the best of luck!\u201d \n\nThat\u2019s it. It\u2019s so simple. Both parties are able to choose and move on. Just be Frank, that\u2019s the beauty of these relationships\u2026 you don\u2019t have to hide. \nUntil this conversation is had do not go to his house, the hotel or on another date (the last one is just my personal opinion) \n\nHope this helps.",

I\u2019ve always brought up the arrangement conversation ahead of the M&G and leave it to the SB to decide is she wants to sort things out ahead of time or at the M&G. I\u2019m older, have way more money, and far more life experience. I view it as my job to make things as easy as I can for her. I have a number I\u2019m willing to use to make her life better. It\u2019s a small piece of my pie and usually a significant amount to her. I always offer the full amount. I have never thought of this as a negotiation. To me that\u2019s an ugly approach that totally misses the point. I would rather spend an extra x,xxx per month and make someone\u2019s life that much better then keep it in my account. The result is happy relationships that have only ended because she moved or was ready for her forever guy. To me, this is the way.",

They have a stable world and loves ones they don't need an SB or over-zealous LE upending.  \n\n\nThat said, I always start a M&G explaining what they can expect from it.  Specifically, I'll explain how I handle arrangements, that I'll leave the restaurant later for their safety, and that I'll text them after and tell them that I had a good time and make an offer if I'm interested so there's no pressure on them in the moment.  \n\n\nI'm never committing any of that to paper/digital form prior to a M&G and sorting out the crazies first.

They have a stable world and loves ones they don't need an SB or over-zealous LE upending.  \n\n\nThat said, I always start a M&G explaining what they can expect from it.  Specifically, I'll explain how I handle arrangements, that I'll leave the restaurant later for their safety, and that I'll text them after and tell them that I had a good time and make an offer if I'm interested so there's no pressure on them in the moment.  \n\n\nI'm never committing any of that to paper/digital form prior to a M&G and sorting out the crazies first.

It really has changed these last few years... and now everyone expects to be an online SB (pfft).  \n\n\nI famously used to tell candidates, \"I really don't trust anyone who wants less than (x) per month; I feel they aren't invested enough in this arrangement or in me.\"  Usually breaks the ice because they feel more comfortable making their ask since I've given a minimum that \\*I\\* will consider.  \n\n\nPPM basically just says that we're going to (or can) use each this one time.  That's not an \"arrangement\" in my book.  There are apps for that!",
