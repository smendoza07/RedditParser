Instead of trimming my hair's and shaping my hair style he ended up shortening my hairs from the side Making it look a little like undercut . I doesn't matter but from next time I swear I will wait for my barber for a month but will never get a haircut from another barber until and unless it is some emergency. At this moment I'm feeling extremely frustrated.",
