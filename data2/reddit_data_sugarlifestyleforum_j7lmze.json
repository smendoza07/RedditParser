It's not that \"obvious\" to live a life in fear, and it's totally disgusting of you to have basically said that she was so stupid that she got killed for it.\n\nYour comment reads like you think that if her \"gut check\" of someone was inaccurate in an \"obvious\" situation, she deserved to die. She just didn't \"gut check\" good enough. So why don't you give us some \"gut check\" tips since you're so great at it?\n\nYou're saying she lacked the sense to avoid something that she deemed was safe enough, so she did not get to avoid this tragic event that you're downplaying as an avoidable scenario that she just willingly walked into because she completely lacked sense.",

Another option is to tell him you took an Uber and then have one pick you up, drive around the block, and drop you back off when he left (because safety is worth $5).",

Dress + heels + hair done + nails done \n\n2) Be alone, men get intimidated by company + it\u2019ll help your chances of being \u201cselected\u201d and not your friends instead lol. I\u2019ve never had me or my friend being approached when we\u2019re together, except by weirdos. Always been approached when I\u2019m alone.\n\n3) Have a drink (no beer no soda, just a nice cocktail) + an appetizer (no full on meals because most people find it rude to interrupt someone eating)\n\n4) Have a notepad/ tablet in hand and have some notes in there so you look \u201cbusy\u201d. Don\u2019t be on the phone with someone, but if you prefer, have the notes app open on your phone but again don\u2019t look too busy or else you\u2019ll not be approachable \n\n5) When you do get approached be polite and smile (don\u2019t laugh or look too happy though!)\n\n6) if they do ask you what you\u2019re doing here just say that you\u2019re wining down and that you just love going to the restaurant/bar.\n\n7) If they ask what you\u2019re doing later and you don\u2019t want to go with them (which you shouldn\u2019t in most cases) tell them you\u2019re going home because you have to wake up early. Or say that you\u2019re getting picked up by a friend (no gender) to go somewhere else inna few.\n\nStay safe have fun \u2764\ufe0f",
