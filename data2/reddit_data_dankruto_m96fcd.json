All you'd get without the Byakugan is the chakra control part, which allows you to send your chakra into your opponent's body, but you wouldn't be able to pinpoint your hits into your opponent's meridians, because you wouldn't be able to see them (the Sharingan can see chakra itself, but not with as much detail as the Byakugan, only as large blobs). Even if you could copy the swift motions of the Gentle Fist, like Sasuke copied Lee's motions, you still have no idea where to hit exactly (and the meridians are said to be the size of a pinhead, so good luck hitting them randomly)\n\nAbout Kabuto, his style was different, he was using a chakra micro-blade to cut muscle and tendons from the inside, to physically immobilize his target. He didn't deal any damage to the chakra paths, so you'd still be able to use techniques (although you wouldn't be able to weave signs if he cut some of your arm muscles or ligaments)",

The sharingan isn't copying the other person's speed per say, but the way their muscle moved, i. e. how they contracted and how much they contracted. By imitating the contractions and how the other person was standing, the sharingan user is almost ''copying'' the other's person's speed. Same thing for the chakra. You aren't literally copying the jutsu, what the sharingan does is allow you to see you how the chakra passed, how much passed, where it passed, for how much time and how did the muscle react.

Sasuke is ridiculously gifted to begin with and if he puts his mind  to it, then there is nothing he *can't* master with just a little bit of training. Which is exactly what he did in that one month period before the final part of the Chunin exam. Also it's pretty obvious Kakashi copied Lee's movements and showed Sasuke during their training. It's a bit of headcanon, but the most obvious conclusion if you think about it.",

All you'd get without the Byakugan is the chakra control part, which allows you to send your chakra into your opponent's body, but you wouldn't be able to pinpoint your hits into your opponent's meridians, because you wouldn't be able to see them (the Sharingan can see chakra itself, but not with as much detail as the Byakugan, only as large blobs). Even if you could copy the swift motions of the Gentle Fist, like Sasuke copied Lee's motions, you still have no idea where to hit exactly (and the meridians are said to be the size of a pinhead, so good luck hitting them randomly)\n\nAbout Kabuto, his style was different, he was using a chakra micro-blade to cut muscle and tendons from the inside, to physically immobilize his target. He didn't deal any damage to the chakra paths, so you'd still be able to use techniques (although you wouldn't be able to weave signs if he cut some of your arm muscles or ligaments)",

The sharingan isn't copying the other person's speed per say, but the way their muscle moved, i. e. how they contracted and how much they contracted. By imitating the contractions and how the other person was standing, the sharingan user is almost ''copying'' the other's person's speed. Same thing for the chakra. You aren't literally copying the jutsu, what the sharingan does is allow you to see you how the chakra passed, how much passed, where it passed, for how much time and how did the muscle react.

All you'd get without the Byakugan is the chakra control part, which allows you to send your chakra into your opponent's body, but you wouldn't be able to pinpoint your hits into your opponent's meridians, because you wouldn't be able to see them (the Sharingan can see chakra itself, but not with as much detail as the Byakugan, only as large blobs). Even if you could copy the swift motions of the Gentle Fist, like Sasuke copied Lee's motions, you still have no idea where to hit exactly (and the meridians are said to be the size of a pinhead, so good luck hitting them randomly)\n\nAbout Kabuto, his style was different, he was using a chakra micro-blade to cut muscle and tendons from the inside, to physically immobilize his target. He didn't deal any damage to the chakra paths, so you'd still be able to use techniques (although you wouldn't be able to weave signs if he cut some of your arm muscles or ligaments)",

You aren't literally copying the jutsu, what the sharingan does is allow you to see you how the chakra passed, how much passed, where it passed, for how much time and how did the muscle react.

Doing all that in a month(minus the time he was hostipalized) cheats the timeline\n\n3 - The only time he actually saw Lee fight was that time he got kicked in the head.

Sasuke is ridiculously gifted to begin with and if he puts his mind  to it, then there is nothing he *can't* master with just a little bit of training. Which is exactly what he did in that one month period before the final part of the Chunin exam. Also it's pretty obvious Kakashi copied Lee's movements and showed Sasuke during their training. It's a bit of headcanon, but the most obvious conclusion if you think about it.",

All you'd get without the Byakugan is the chakra control part, which allows you to send your chakra into your opponent's body, but you wouldn't be able to pinpoint your hits into your opponent's meridians, because you wouldn't be able to see them (the Sharingan can see chakra itself, but not with as much detail as the Byakugan, only as large blobs). Even if you could copy the swift motions of the Gentle Fist, like Sasuke copied Lee's motions, you still have no idea where to hit exactly (and the meridians are said to be the size of a pinhead, so good luck hitting them randomly)\n\nAbout Kabuto, his style was different, he was using a chakra micro-blade to cut muscle and tendons from the inside, to physically immobilize his target. He didn't deal any damage to the chakra paths, so you'd still be able to use techniques (although you wouldn't be able to weave signs if he cut some of your arm muscles or ligaments)",

All you'd get without the Byakugan is the chakra control part, which allows you to send your chakra into your opponent's body, but you wouldn't be able to pinpoint your hits into your opponent's meridians, because you wouldn't be able to see them (the Sharingan can see chakra itself, but not with as much detail as the Byakugan, only as large blobs). Even if you could copy the swift motions of the Gentle Fist, like Sasuke copied Lee's motions, you still have no idea where to hit exactly (and the meridians are said to be the size of a pinhead, so good luck hitting them randomly)\n\nAbout Kabuto, his style was different, he was using a chakra micro-blade to cut muscle and tendons from the inside, to physically immobilize his target. He didn't deal any damage to the chakra paths, so you'd still be able to use techniques (although you wouldn't be able to weave signs if he cut some of your arm muscles or ligaments)",

Which is exactly what he did in that one month period before the final part of the Chunin exam. Also it's pretty obvious Kakashi copied Lee's movements and showed Sasuke during their training.

All you'd get without the Byakugan is the chakra control part, which allows you to send your chakra into your opponent's body, but you wouldn't be able to pinpoint your hits into your opponent's meridians, because you wouldn't be able to see them (the Sharingan can see chakra itself, but not with as much detail as the Byakugan, only as large blobs). Even if you could copy the swift motions of the Gentle Fist, like Sasuke copied Lee's motions, you still have no idea where to hit exactly (and the meridians are said to be the size of a pinhead, so good luck hitting them randomly)\n\nAbout Kabuto, his style was different, he was using a chakra micro-blade to cut muscle and tendons from the inside, to physically immobilize his target. He didn't deal any damage to the chakra paths, so you'd still be able to use techniques (although you wouldn't be able to weave signs if he cut some of your arm muscles or ligaments)",
