So you need the 5% of the 5% to both find you and be nearby and interested. \n\nThose are long odds.\n\nWhat I would say is it doesn't hurt to look. But what I would say -- with nothing but kindness -- is that your chances are slim and I would not get your hopes up.\n\nThat said, I wish you nothing but success in your search and good things in your life.",

I can\u2019t confirm they\u2019re legit SDs, but it\u2019s something I\u2019m seeing far more than I expected to on a sugar site since I first started years ago. None of them are seeking platonic only though. If you\u2019re in an area with fair potential for SDs interested in trans SBs, it\u2019s very unlikely they\u2019re going to want to \u201cspoil\u201d someone for platonic only, as I know you\u2019ve been told already. Regardless, no harm in putting it out there. Good luck!",
