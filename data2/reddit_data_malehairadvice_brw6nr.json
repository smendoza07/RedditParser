Maybe go to the barber and ask for a buzz with the 3 guard and see how it looks. It won't take long for it to get some length from that short. Totally up to you, but I had long hair my whole life and loved my buzzcut, although I look better with a standard short cut. best of luck! ;)",

I'm telling you. \n\nMaybe get new glasses too. Full rim, but thinner. Same shape is fine, maybe try others? I think you can really shape and frame your face with glasses, and it makes all the difference for a new look. Dont be afraid of tortoise or a coffee colored frame. Check out mariner on eyebuydirect, maybe Birmingham. That's what I'm thinking. Trimmed and controlled stubble, maybe even a mid-length beard could do something for you.\n\n(No I dont work for eyebuydirect, get something else, or nothing...just suggestions!)",

Only 2-4% of people experience side effects like sexual dysfunction and gyno (man boobs) and people have reported brain fog. These resolve after two weeks of quitting but there are people out there saying they have persistent side effects of the drug however doctors and others don\u2019t believe the condition exists because it\u2019s so rare and it\u2019s not yet officially recognized as a rare condition.\n\nSo I\u2019m just putting this out there to warn you. You can weight out the pros and cons with your doctor when you ask about the medication but yeah. Sorry if this sounds scary but I\u2019m here to tell you both sides of the drug. Goodluck!",

Maybe go to the barber and ask for a buzz with the 3 guard and see how it looks. It won't take long for it to get some length from that short.

Only 2-4% of people experience side effects like sexual dysfunction and gyno (man boobs) and people have reported brain fog. These resolve after two weeks of quitting but there are people out there saying they have persistent side effects of the drug however doctors and others don\u2019t believe the condition exists because it\u2019s so rare and it\u2019s not yet officially recognized as a rare condition.\n\nSo I\u2019m just putting this out there to warn you. You can weight out the pros and cons with your doctor when you ask about the medication but yeah. Sorry if this sounds scary but I\u2019m here to tell you both sides of the drug. Goodluck!",

Only 2-4% of people experience side effects like sexual dysfunction and gyno (man boobs) and people have reported brain fog. These resolve after two weeks of quitting but there are people out there saying they have persistent side effects of the drug however doctors and others don\u2019t believe the condition exists because it\u2019s so rare and it\u2019s not yet officially recognized as a rare condition.\n\nSo I\u2019m just putting this out there to warn you. You can weight out the pros and cons with your doctor when you ask about the medication but yeah. Sorry if this sounds scary but I\u2019m here to tell you both sides of the drug. Goodluck!",

Maybe go to the barber and ask for a buzz with the 3 guard and see how it looks. It won't take long for it to get some length from that short.
