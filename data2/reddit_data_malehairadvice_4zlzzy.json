If you want an edge up or a beard trim for $10 then that's fine, but I'm not going to spend a half hour or longer going to extra lengths to make sure the cut is perfect and wash and style it and offer you a beer or wine for $10. If you want to pay that and have someone who will do it, then more power to you. If you can't afford $30 for a cut once a month, then you should probably ask for a raise, consider a new job with better pay or maybe just not keep your hair that short. I've spent too much time, money and effort honing my skills and becoming the best I can be at my craft to sell myself short. My price is my decision and how I pay my bills, so if you don't like it, then take it down to SuperCuts.  \n  \nEdit; A word.",

If you favor classic hairstyles such as crew cuts and side parts and the like, look at the clientele of the barber. For example, my hometown barber is packed with older guys (50+ mostly, a noticeable amount of guys in their 70s). I'm 22, I'm pretty much always the youngest person in there. My barber is an ancient Italian man who's probably 5'4'' if he stands on his tippy toes. These are classic, old-fashioned men, they don't screw around with their appearance. They sit down in the chair and the barber goes to work without them even saying what they want, he knows what they want because they've probably been going there longer than I've been alive. \n\nEssentially what I'm getting at is that older guys, both customers and the barber, probably means it's a quality barber. I've lived in three different cities in the span  of four years and this little observation has never failed me.  ",

If you're married, I assume you've been off the market for a while (and older than OP). Of course it changes based on location, but the general popular western culture nowadays has a lot of women seeking \"overly\" groomed men. Lined up eyebrows and beards come with the same wave of popularity that has women wearing makeup till they look plastic. ",

You may need to scroll down to multiple comment pages if you have commented a lot.  \n\n   After doing all of the above, you are welcome to join me on [Voat](https://voat.co/)!",

If you want to pay that and have someone who will do it, then more power to you. If you can't afford $30 for a cut once a month, then you should probably ask for a raise, consider a new job with better pay or maybe just not keep your hair that short. I've spent too much time, money and effort honing my skills and becoming the best I can be at my craft to sell myself short. My price is my decision and how I pay my bills, so if you don't like it, then take it down to SuperCuts.  \n  \nEdit; A word.",

If you favor classic hairstyles such as crew cuts and side parts and the like, look at the clientele of the barber. For example, my hometown barber is packed with older guys (50+ mostly, a noticeable amount of guys in their 70s). I'm 22, I'm pretty much always the youngest person in there. My barber is an ancient Italian man who's probably 5'4'' if he stands on his tippy toes. These are classic, old-fashioned men, they don't screw around with their appearance. They sit down in the chair and the barber goes to work without them even saying what they want, he knows what they want because they've probably been going there longer than I've been alive. \n\nEssentially what I'm getting at is that older guys, both customers and the barber, probably means it's a quality barber. I've lived in three different cities in the span  of four years and this little observation has never failed me.  ",

If you want an edge up or a beard trim for $10 then that's fine, but I'm not going to spend a half hour or longer going to extra lengths to make sure the cut is perfect and wash and style it and offer you a beer or wine for $10. If you want to pay that and have someone who will do it, then more power to you. If you can't afford $30 for a cut once a month, then you should probably ask for a raise, consider a new job with better pay or maybe just not keep your hair that short. I've spent too much time, money and effort honing my skills and becoming the best I can be at my craft to sell myself short. My price is my decision and how I pay my bills, so if you don't like it, then take it down to SuperCuts.  \n  \nEdit; A word.",

If you favor classic hairstyles such as crew cuts and side parts and the like, look at the clientele of the barber. For example, my hometown barber is packed with older guys (50+ mostly, a noticeable amount of guys in their 70s). I'm 22, I'm pretty much always the youngest person in there. My barber is an ancient Italian man who's probably 5'4'' if he stands on his tippy toes. These are classic, old-fashioned men, they don't screw around with their appearance. They sit down in the chair and the barber goes to work without them even saying what they want, he knows what they want because they've probably been going there longer than I've been alive. \n\nEssentially what I'm getting at is that older guys, both customers and the barber, probably means it's a quality barber. I've lived in three different cities in the span  of four years and this little observation has never failed me.  ",

If you want an edge up or a beard trim for $10 then that's fine, but I'm not going to spend a half hour or longer going to extra lengths to make sure the cut is perfect and wash and style it and offer you a beer or wine for $10. If you want to pay that and have someone who will do it, then more power to you. If you can't afford $30 for a cut once a month, then you should probably ask for a raise, consider a new job with better pay or maybe just not keep your hair that short. I've spent too much time, money and effort honing my skills and becoming the best I can be at my craft to sell myself short. My price is my decision and how I pay my bills, so if you don't like it, then take it down to SuperCuts.  \n  \nEdit; A word.",

You may need to scroll down to multiple comment pages if you have commented a lot.  \n\n   After doing all of the above, you are welcome to join me on [Voat](https://voat.co/)!",

If you want an edge up or a beard trim for $10 then that's fine, but I'm not going to spend a half hour or longer going to extra lengths to make sure the cut is perfect and wash and style it and offer you a beer or wine for $10. If you want to pay that and have someone who will do it, then more power to you. If you can't afford $30 for a cut once a month, then you should probably ask for a raise, consider a new job with better pay or maybe just not keep your hair that short. I've spent too much time, money and effort honing my skills and becoming the best I can be at my craft to sell myself short. My price is my decision and how I pay my bills, so if you don't like it, then take it down to SuperCuts.  \n  \nEdit; A word.",

            "body": "I have left reddit for [Voat](https://voat.co/) due to years of admin mismanagement and preferential treatment for certain subreddits and users holding certain political and ideological views.  \n\n   The situation has gotten especially worse since the appointment of Ellen Pao as CEO, culminating in the seemingly unjustified firings of several valuable employees and bans on hundreds of vibrant communities on completely trumped-up charges.  \n\n   The resignation of Ellen Pao and the appointment of Steve Huffman as CEO, despite initial hopes, has continued the same trend.  \n\n   As an act of protest, I have chosen to redact all the comments I've ever made on reddit, overwriting them with this message.  \n\n   If you would like to do the same, install [TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) for Chrome, [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for Firefox, [NinjaKit](https://github.com/os0x/NinjaKit) for Safari, [Violent Monkey](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/violent-monkey/) for Opera, or [AdGuard](http://adguard.com/) for Internet Explorer (in Advanced Mode), then add [this GreaseMonkey script](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/10905-reddit-overwrite-extended).   \n\n Finally, click on your username at the top right corner of reddit, click on the comments tab, and click on the new OVERWRITE button at the top of the page. You may need to scroll down to multiple comment pages if you have commented a lot.  \n\n   After doing all of the above, you are welcome to join me on [Voat](https://voat.co/)!",
