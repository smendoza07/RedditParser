Everyone there is a green muscular humanoid, but one time there was group who were like \u201cfuck this shit being green sucks.\u201d So they hopped in a spaceship and wandered to universe looking for a way to not be green anymore. After many failed attempts and visits to a wide array of different planets and stars, they finally stumbled upon planet earth. They soon realized that earth\u2019s humans were not green. However, as fate deemed it, they were literally meant to be green and there was no way around it. However, they decided to stay on Earth because Namek sucked big time. Not long after their decision to stay, the 5 Namekians began to get a name for themselves around the world. They were powerful beings who\u2019s talents were sought after in a war torn world. They eventually got an offer for a job that may turn into a way to still see their dreams of not being green through. It was a very wealthy man who was the head of his household, the Kaz\u00e8 clan. The man told the Namekians that he wanted them to marry and breed with his 5 daughters. They were all beautiful with blonde hair and blue eyes. The man told them that their bloodlines could create something the world had never seen. The namekians didn\u2019t give two fucks about bloodlines, their eyes lit up at the thought of their future generations not being green anymore. The daughters bred with the Namekians and eventually took over as the leaders of the Kaz\u00e8 clan, however toward the end of their lives, the women and their green ass husbands decided to rename the clan, to honor both of their legacies. The new clan was called \u201cNamikaze.\u201d The Namikaze clan was not very big, but those who descended from the Namekian bloodline, were powerful. 4 generations after the Namekins had died, their dream finally came true. There had always been hints of green in the children\u2019s skin tone\u2026 until now. A perfect, little, not green, blonde haired blue eyes boy was born. Lottle did they know he would grow up to be the 4th Hokage, and father of the child of prophecy. \n\nNaruto\u2019s great great great great great greens grandfather was Piccolo idiots. Namikaze clan is best clan.",

I've always assumed the process would be immediate if a senju implanted the sharingan. But I have no sources for either of these theories\n\nchapter 671: Sage of 6 paths says that combining parts of ashura's Chakra with parts of indra's would create his own Chakra and result in the rinnegan. He doesn't specify it only being possible for reincarnations, only that he expected it to happen at some point for the reincarnations. \n\nChapter 560: kabuto mentions that reincarnated madara has the rinnegan because he added hashirama cells.\n\nYou can find other chapters or scenes that make reference to it but the rinnegan only requires Senju Chakra (or DNA) and Uchiha Chakra (or sharingan) to activate. Any non reincarnation can get it",

It makes contradictory statements with what we've been shown. Article 2 says you need to be a reincarnation because you need speficially ASHURA and INDRA *CHAKRA*. However both the senju and Uchiha are decendants of ashura and indra and by default posses their Chakra. That has been mentioned in the show as well.\n\nUnless Article 2 meant the person awakening it requires the *SOUL* of ashura and indra, in which case it is still incorrect as madara reincarnation awoke the rinnegan in accordance with kabuto's theory, something that surprised even madara. The theory being that combining Senju and Uchiha cells would awaken the rinnegan. And reincarnated madara and hashirama were both stated to no longer have ashura and indra souls inside of them, which means he shouldn't have been able to **awaken** the rinnegan in that form.\n\nBoth of your Article sources are putting information together to draw theories but neither are official and in some cases they directly contradict what was shown/told in the actual story.\n\n>My conclusion is since there is no official answer of the requirements for the Rinnegan both are equally valid theories until we get a Canon answer\n\nI would agree with you, but madara called the rinnegan the next form of the sharingan. And the sharingan and it's respective stages are awoken by Uchiha who meet the specific requirements for awakening. So even if the rinnegan was limited to only descendants of ashura and indra- heck even if it was only limited to Uchiha- it still discredits the statement that only reincarnations can awaken it.\n\nIf you want to talk about theories then my theory is that Uchiha who take senju DNA take years before being able to awaken the rinnegan and senju who take a sharingan will awaken it immediately. But again that's just a theory much like your sources.\n\nThe only fact there is that it took an Uchiha decades to awaken the rinnegan after combining the 2 chakra",

Even more so if you consider that few people have the same mutation, which means that you can\u2019t expect both parents to carry that trait unless it\u2019s genetic.\n\nWood style is a mutation just like we are pretending the human brain to be, but this time it acts like you expect a recessive gene to act. His children had a chance to carry it, but unless they\u2019d interbreed it wouldn\u2019t manifest. Which is exactly what we see happening in the anime",

I think it's important to have the ship hints tho cause IRL kids that age are doing the same, and just like in Naruto, it was interesting to me to see who they were crushing on as kids and who they eventually married, if anyone. They've done similar things in Boruto obviously. Originally I was more thinking Boruto and that class president girl would be shipped, but their kid would be OP enough to create a third show from, so I'm guessing Boruto and Sarada will be official sometime after the next timeskip or two. \n\nPics of them as kids are a tad creepy tho (at minimum), ngl.",

Everyone there is a green muscular humanoid, but one time there was group who were like \u201cfuck this shit being green sucks.\u201d So they hopped in a spaceship and wandered to universe looking for a way to not be green anymore. After many failed attempts and visits to a wide array of different planets and stars, they finally stumbled upon planet earth. They soon realized that earth\u2019s humans were not green. However, as fate deemed it, they were literally meant to be green and there was no way around it. However, they decided to stay on Earth because Namek sucked big time. Not long after their decision to stay, the 5 Namekians began to get a name for themselves around the world. They were powerful beings who\u2019s talents were sought after in a war torn world. They eventually got an offer for a job that may turn into a way to still see their dreams of not being green through. It was a very wealthy man who was the head of his household, the Kaz\u00e8 clan. The man told the Namekians that he wanted them to marry and breed with his 5 daughters. They were all beautiful with blonde hair and blue eyes. The man told them that their bloodlines could create something the world had never seen. The namekians didn\u2019t give two fucks about bloodlines, their eyes lit up at the thought of their future generations not being green anymore. The daughters bred with the Namekians and eventually took over as the leaders of the Kaz\u00e8 clan, however toward the end of their lives, the women and their green ass husbands decided to rename the clan, to honor both of their legacies. The new clan was called \u201cNamikaze.\u201d The Namikaze clan was not very big, but those who descended from the Namekian bloodline, were powerful. 4 generations after the Namekins had died, their dream finally came true. There had always been hints of green in the children\u2019s skin tone\u2026 until now. A perfect, little, not green, blonde haired blue eyes boy was born. Lottle did they know he would grow up to be the 4th Hokage, and father of the child of prophecy. \n\nNaruto\u2019s great great great great great greens grandfather was Piccolo idiots.

He doesn't specify it only being possible for reincarnations, only that he expected it to happen at some point for the reincarnations. \n\nChapter 560: kabuto mentions that reincarnated madara has the rinnegan because he added hashirama cells.\n\nThe stone tablet also mentions \"Seeking stability, one god was divided into yin and yang, these opposing two acting together obtain all things in creation\"",

I've always assumed the process would be immediate if a senju implanted the sharingan. But I have no sources for either of these theories\n\nchapter 671: Sage of 6 paths says that combining parts of ashura's Chakra with parts of indra's would create his own Chakra and result in the rinnegan. He doesn't specify it only being possible for reincarnations, only that he expected it to happen at some point for the reincarnations. \n\nChapter 560: kabuto mentions that reincarnated madara has the rinnegan because he added hashirama cells.\n\nYou can find other chapters or scenes that make reference to it but the rinnegan only requires Senju Chakra (or DNA) and Uchiha Chakra (or sharingan) to activate. Any non reincarnation can get it",

It makes contradictory statements with what we've been shown. Article 2 says you need to be a reincarnation because you need speficially ASHURA and INDRA *CHAKRA*. However both the senju and Uchiha are decendants of ashura and indra and by default posses their Chakra. That has been mentioned in the show as well.\n\nUnless Article 2 meant the person awakening it requires the *SOUL* of ashura and indra, in which case it is still incorrect as madara reincarnation awoke the rinnegan in accordance with kabuto's theory, something that surprised even madara. The theory being that combining Senju and Uchiha cells would awaken the rinnegan. And reincarnated madara and hashirama were both stated to no longer have ashura and indra souls inside of them, which means he shouldn't have been able to **awaken** the rinnegan in that form.\n\nBoth of your Article sources are putting information together to draw theories but neither are official and in some cases they directly contradict what was shown/told in the actual story.\n\n>My conclusion is since there is no official answer of the requirements for the Rinnegan both are equally valid theories until we get a Canon answer\n\nI would agree with you, but madara called the rinnegan the next form of the sharingan. And the sharingan and it's respective stages are awoken by Uchiha who meet the specific requirements for awakening. So even if the rinnegan was limited to only descendants of ashura and indra- heck even if it was only limited to Uchiha- it still discredits the statement that only reincarnations can awaken it.\n\nIf you want to talk about theories then my theory is that Uchiha who take senju DNA take years before being able to awaken the rinnegan and senju who take a sharingan will awaken it immediately. But again that's just a theory much like your sources.\n\nThe only fact there is that it took an Uchiha decades to awaken the rinnegan after combining the 2 chakra",

In the past you could ship any character even if they were young, because anime wasn't really main stream and was generally fun to watch and things like reddit and Twitter didn't exist. Also the MHA fanbase didn't exist. Like im fine with shipping characters even if they are young but the MHA fanbase reminded me that there is some sick bastards in this world that actually simp for underaged characters and i actually encountered one who called me a pedophile because I simped for a legal character, but then they simp for toga and bakugou who are super young and say it's completely fine.",

They've done similar things in Boruto obviously. Originally I was more thinking Boruto and that class president girl would be shipped, but their kid would be OP enough to create a third show from, so I'm guessing Boruto and Sarada will be official sometime after the next timeskip or two. \n\nPics of them as kids are a tad creepy tho (at minimum), ngl.",

He doesn't specify it only being possible for reincarnations, only that he expected it to happen at some point for the reincarnations. \n\nChapter 560: kabuto mentions that reincarnated madara has the rinnegan because he added hashirama cells.\n\nThe stone tablet also mentions \"Seeking stability, one god was divided into yin and yang, these opposing two acting together obtain all things in creation\"",

I've always assumed the process would be immediate if a senju implanted the sharingan. But I have no sources for either of these theories\n\nchapter 671: Sage of 6 paths says that combining parts of ashura's Chakra with parts of indra's would create his own Chakra and result in the rinnegan. He doesn't specify it only being possible for reincarnations, only that he expected it to happen at some point for the reincarnations. \n\nChapter 560: kabuto mentions that reincarnated madara has the rinnegan because he added hashirama cells.\n\nYou can find other chapters or scenes that make reference to it but the rinnegan only requires Senju Chakra (or DNA) and Uchiha Chakra (or sharingan) to activate. Any non reincarnation can get it",

It makes contradictory statements with what we've been shown. Article 2 says you need to be a reincarnation because you need speficially ASHURA and INDRA *CHAKRA*. However both the senju and Uchiha are decendants of ashura and indra and by default posses their Chakra. That has been mentioned in the show as well.\n\nUnless Article 2 meant the person awakening it requires the *SOUL* of ashura and indra, in which case it is still incorrect as madara reincarnation awoke the rinnegan in accordance with kabuto's theory, something that surprised even madara. The theory being that combining Senju and Uchiha cells would awaken the rinnegan. And reincarnated madara and hashirama were both stated to no longer have ashura and indra souls inside of them, which means he shouldn't have been able to **awaken** the rinnegan in that form.\n\nBoth of your Article sources are putting information together to draw theories but neither are official and in some cases they directly contradict what was shown/told in the actual story.\n\n>My conclusion is since there is no official answer of the requirements for the Rinnegan both are equally valid theories until we get a Canon answer\n\nI would agree with you, but madara called the rinnegan the next form of the sharingan. And the sharingan and it's respective stages are awoken by Uchiha who meet the specific requirements for awakening. So even if the rinnegan was limited to only descendants of ashura and indra- heck even if it was only limited to Uchiha- it still discredits the statement that only reincarnations can awaken it.\n\nIf you want to talk about theories then my theory is that Uchiha who take senju DNA take years before being able to awaken the rinnegan and senju who take a sharingan will awaken it immediately. But again that's just a theory much like your sources.\n\nThe only fact there is that it took an Uchiha decades to awaken the rinnegan after combining the 2 chakra",

He doesn't specify it only being possible for reincarnations, only that he expected it to happen at some point for the reincarnations. \n\nChapter 560: kabuto mentions that reincarnated madara has the rinnegan because he added hashirama cells.\n\nThe stone tablet also mentions \"Seeking stability, one god was divided into yin and yang, these opposing two acting together obtain all things in creation\"",

                                    "body": "Article 1 cites danzo as an example for why a non Uchiha/senju can't awaken the rinnegan but it fails to account for the fact that it took madara decades after getting hashirama's cells to awaken the rinnegan.\n\nArticle 1 also does not negate any ordinary uchiha/senju awakening the rinnegan by combining the Chakra of the other.\n\nArticle 2 is objective wrong. It makes contradictory statements with what we've been shown. Article 2 says you need to be a reincarnation because you need speficially ASHURA and INDRA *CHAKRA*. However both the senju and Uchiha are decendants of ashura and indra and by default posses their Chakra. That has been mentioned in the show as well.\n\nUnless Article 2 meant the person awakening it requires the *SOUL* of ashura and indra, in which case it is still incorrect as madara reincarnation awoke the rinnegan in accordance with kabuto's theory, something that surprised even madara. The theory being that combining Senju and Uchiha cells would awaken the rinnegan. And reincarnated madara and hashirama were both stated to no longer have ashura and indra souls inside of them, which means he shouldn't have been able to **awaken** the rinnegan in that form.\n\nBoth of your Article sources are putting information together to draw theories but neither are official and in some cases they directly contradict what was shown/told in the actual story.\n\n>My conclusion is since there is no official answer of the requirements for the Rinnegan both are equally valid theories until we get a Canon answer\n\nI would agree with you, but madara called the rinnegan the next form of the sharingan. And the sharingan and it's respective stages are awoken by Uchiha who meet the specific requirements for awakening. So even if the rinnegan was limited to only descendants of ashura and indra- heck even if it was only limited to Uchiha- it still discredits the statement that only reincarnations can awaken it.\n\nIf you want to talk about theories then my theory is that Uchiha who take senju DNA take years before being able to awaken the rinnegan and senju who take a sharingan will awaken it immediately. But again that's just a theory much like your sources.\n\nThe only fact there is that it took an Uchiha decades to awaken the rinnegan after combining the 2 chakra",

He doesn't specify it only being possible for reincarnations, only that he expected it to happen at some point for the reincarnations. \n\nChapter 560: kabuto mentions that reincarnated madara has the rinnegan because he added hashirama cells.\n\nThe stone tablet also mentions \"Seeking stability, one god was divided into yin and yang, these opposing two acting together obtain all things in creation\"",

It makes contradictory statements with what we've been shown. Article 2 says you need to be a reincarnation because you need speficially ASHURA and INDRA *CHAKRA*. However both the senju and Uchiha are decendants of ashura and indra and by default posses their Chakra. That has been mentioned in the show as well.\n\nUnless Article 2 meant the person awakening it requires the *SOUL* of ashura and indra, in which case it is still incorrect as madara reincarnation awoke the rinnegan in accordance with kabuto's theory, something that surprised even madara. The theory being that combining Senju and Uchiha cells would awaken the rinnegan. And reincarnated madara and hashirama were both stated to no longer have ashura and indra souls inside of them, which means he shouldn't have been able to **awaken** the rinnegan in that form.\n\nBoth of your Article sources are putting information together to draw theories but neither are official and in some cases they directly contradict what was shown/told in the actual story.\n\n>My conclusion is since there is no official answer of the requirements for the Rinnegan both are equally valid theories until we get a Canon answer\n\nI would agree with you, but madara called the rinnegan the next form of the sharingan. And the sharingan and it's respective stages are awoken by Uchiha who meet the specific requirements for awakening. So even if the rinnegan was limited to only descendants of ashura and indra- heck even if it was only limited to Uchiha- it still discredits the statement that only reincarnations can awaken it.\n\nIf you want to talk about theories then my theory is that Uchiha who take senju DNA take years before being able to awaken the rinnegan and senju who take a sharingan will awaken it immediately. But again that's just a theory much like your sources.\n\nThe only fact there is that it took an Uchiha decades to awaken the rinnegan after combining the 2 chakra",

He doesn't specify it only being possible for reincarnations, only that he expected it to happen at some point for the reincarnations. \n\nChapter 560: kabuto mentions that reincarnated madara has the rinnegan because he added hashirama cells.\n\nThe stone tablet also mentions \"Seeking stability, one god was divided into yin and yang, these opposing two acting together obtain all things in creation\"",

It makes contradictory statements with what we've been shown. Article 2 says you need to be a reincarnation because you need speficially ASHURA and INDRA *CHAKRA*. However both the senju and Uchiha are decendants of ashura and indra and by default posses their Chakra. That has been mentioned in the show as well.\n\nUnless Article 2 meant the person awakening it requires the *SOUL* of ashura and indra, in which case it is still incorrect as madara reincarnation awoke the rinnegan in accordance with kabuto's theory, something that surprised even madara. The theory being that combining Senju and Uchiha cells would awaken the rinnegan. And reincarnated madara and hashirama were both stated to no longer have ashura and indra souls inside of them, which means he shouldn't have been able to **awaken** the rinnegan in that form.\n\nBoth of your Article sources are putting information together to draw theories but neither are official and in some cases they directly contradict what was shown/told in the actual story.\n\n>My conclusion is since there is no official answer of the requirements for the Rinnegan both are equally valid theories until we get a Canon answer\n\nI would agree with you, but madara called the rinnegan the next form of the sharingan. And the sharingan and it's respective stages are awoken by Uchiha who meet the specific requirements for awakening. So even if the rinnegan was limited to only descendants of ashura and indra- heck even if it was only limited to Uchiha- it still discredits the statement that only reincarnations can awaken it.\n\nIf you want to talk about theories then my theory is that Uchiha who take senju DNA take years before being able to awaken the rinnegan and senju who take a sharingan will awaken it immediately. But again that's just a theory much like your sources.\n\nThe only fact there is that it took an Uchiha decades to awaken the rinnegan after combining the 2 chakra",

            "body": "Article 1 cites danzo as an example for why a non Uchiha/senju can't awaken the rinnegan but it fails to account for the fact that it took madara decades after getting hashirama's cells to awaken the rinnegan.\n\nArticle 1 also does not negate any ordinary uchiha/senju awakening the rinnegan by combining the Chakra of the other.\n\nArticle 2 is objective wrong. It makes contradictory statements with what we've been shown. Article 2 says you need to be a reincarnation because you need speficially ASHURA and INDRA *CHAKRA*. However both the senju and Uchiha are decendants of ashura and indra and by default posses their Chakra. That has been mentioned in the show as well.\n\nUnless Article 2 meant the person awakening it requires the *SOUL* of ashura and indra, in which case it is still incorrect as madara reincarnation awoke the rinnegan in accordance with kabuto's theory, something that surprised even madara. The theory being that combining Senju and Uchiha cells would awaken the rinnegan. And reincarnated madara and hashirama were both stated to no longer have ashura and indra souls inside of them, which means he shouldn't have been able to **awaken** the rinnegan in that form.\n\nBoth of your Article sources are putting information together to draw theories but neither are official and in some cases they directly contradict what was shown/told in the actual story.\n\n>My conclusion is since there is no official answer of the requirements for the Rinnegan both are equally valid theories until we get a Canon answer\n\nI would agree with you, but madara called the rinnegan the next form of the sharingan. And the sharingan and it's respective stages are awoken by Uchiha who meet the specific requirements for awakening. So even if the rinnegan was limited to only descendants of ashura and indra- heck even if it was only limited to Uchiha- it still discredits the statement that only reincarnations can awaken it.\n\nIf you want to talk about theories then my theory is that Uchiha who take senju DNA take years before being able to awaken the rinnegan and senju who take a sharingan will awaken it immediately. But again that's just a theory much like your sources.\n\nThe only fact there is that it took an Uchiha decades to awaken the rinnegan after combining the 2 chakra",
