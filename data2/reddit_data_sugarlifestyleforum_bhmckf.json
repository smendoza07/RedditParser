    "body": "Went on a second date with a SD. (After talking  with a few weirdos I\u2019ll admit) Had a great night, went for a walk around his farm, had dinner, built a bonfire, watched a movie and then ended up in bed. \n\nBest sex of my entire life! \n\nNot only have I never had someone try so hard to make me feel good, but halfway thorough he flipped a switch and was suddenly fulfilling a secret fantasy of mine that I hadn\u2019t told him about. \n\nI was actually worried I\u2019d struggle to be into it, knowing how much older he was and preparing to have to do most of the work (you know what i mean). But WOW! I am moving soon so we have agreed we are keeping things very casual but I\u2019m happy that a) I was able to go through with it, and b) it was awesome!!! I know it won\u2019t happen with every SD but I feel lucky that the first time worked out.\n\n\nEdit for all of you out there that want to know the fantasy - in very small and petite. There was a little bit of dominance, sort of dd/lg but mostly I just like to be picked up and thrown around a bit , like up against a wall or onto the couch. \n\nSorry it\u2019s not that exciting",
