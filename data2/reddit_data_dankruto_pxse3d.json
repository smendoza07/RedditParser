I mean most lines up, but the anime doesn't ignore (all) filler after the fact? So saying it isn't cannon is basically telling the millions of people who will only ever watch the anime that they can't have a discussion about the show they love. Sorry but most of these discussions are about the anime not manga  so you kinda gotta let that slide when discussing.",

Readers are obviously left wondering where that portion of the flashback fits in. \n\nAnd then, finally in ch 403, we get the reveal of itachi crying and the continuation of the flashback leading to the [sideways headband](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10403000/20.jpg), that was first shown in ch 127. \n\nAlso worth noting in ch 221 that clear foreshadowing of the [coup de ta](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10221000/15.jpg) and also [Itachi\u2019s relationship with Sasuke](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10221000/19.jpg) is shown.\n\nGoing further, [the first time we see Itachi on screen](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10139000/1.jpg), Kisame is snidely questioning his loyalty. We know that Kisame is the most loyal of the Akatsuki, and the Akatsuki grunt pairings are purposefully made to oppose each other. (Money/materialism vs Religion/higher purpose, ephemeral vs eternal art. Kisame was loyal to the cause, while Itachi was treacherous. Itachi needed to act undercover, as to not raise any suspicion. \n\nAlso, in chapter 140, [we get confirmation that itachi is stronger than Orochimaru, and therefor stronger than Sanin level](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10140000/5.jpg)\n\nBut then we have Itachi downplaying himself and agreeing that a sanin level fighter is too much [for him, despite already being stronger than a sanin](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10144000/9.jpg). This of course comes into play later when they flee vs Jiraiya, while making it believable. \n\nAnd then we have [in 144](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10144000/10.jpg), leaf jonin thinking how odd it is that the Akatsuki are acting so sloppily in their search.\n\nWe also have Kakashi commenting on how [itachi could kill him if he wanted](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10142000/17.jpg)\n\nAnd of course itachi indirectly leaking the Akatsuki are coming after the biju.\n\nAnd even if you feel like disregarding all that, the author himself said that Itachi was planned. \n\nI tried to be as comprehensive as possible. Let me know if I missed anything\n\nEdit: This is not my comment. I just copied and pasted from another one. The one who actually wrote it is u/SaintAhmad Full credits to him",

Instead Itachi uses Kotoamatsukami on himself to break Kabutos control of revived Edo Tensei Itachi. But that was never its intended purpose.",

The Uchiha were right to attempt a coup since they were in existential danger. With Itachi and Shisui's mindset though I could see them preventing the coup though. Perhaps one of them shoud have challenged Fugaku to a battle for leadership of the clan. If Shisui won then he could move the clan out of the Land of Fire at night. If this were after Danzo killed Shisui then Fugaku probably wouldn't fight Itachi in which case he'd have to go along with Itachi's plan of leaving the village.\n\nSure the other clan members wouldn't like it but they'd have to win against Itachi or Shisui.\n\nDanzo wanted to kill them from the start and Koharu and Homura were power freaks. They literally said they had to kill them otherwise they'd lose their power.\n\nThe leaders of a country are supposed to serve the people but they and irl leaders think it's the other way around.",

Now imagine the same scenario, but with 100 or so Sasukes... Yeah gl with that...\n\nThe reason he didn't kill Sasuke ain't bcs he was a kid, buy because he couldn't bring himself to do so and his parents told him to protect Sasuke. So, what he did was he told Sasuke to get revenge on him, meaning Sasuke would not be angry at the leaf, but at itachi and the story would get a \"happy\" ending. On paper at least.

I mean most lines up, but the anime doesn't ignore (all) filler after the fact? So saying it isn't cannon is basically telling the millions of people who will only ever watch the anime that they can't have a discussion about the show they love. Sorry but most of these discussions are about the anime not manga  so you kinda gotta let that slide when discussing.",

Readers are obviously left wondering where that portion of the flashback fits in. \n\nAnd then, finally in ch 403, we get the reveal of itachi crying and the continuation of the flashback leading to the [sideways headband](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10403000/20.jpg), that was first shown in ch 127. \n\nAlso worth noting in ch 221 that clear foreshadowing of the [coup de ta](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10221000/15.jpg) and also [Itachi\u2019s relationship with Sasuke](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10221000/19.jpg) is shown.\n\nGoing further, [the first time we see Itachi on screen](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10139000/1.jpg), Kisame is snidely questioning his loyalty. We know that Kisame is the most loyal of the Akatsuki, and the Akatsuki grunt pairings are purposefully made to oppose each other. (Money/materialism vs Religion/higher purpose, ephemeral vs eternal art. Kisame was loyal to the cause, while Itachi was treacherous. Itachi needed to act undercover, as to not raise any suspicion. \n\nAlso, in chapter 140, [we get confirmation that itachi is stronger than Orochimaru, and therefor stronger than Sanin level](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10140000/5.jpg)\n\nBut then we have Itachi downplaying himself and agreeing that a sanin level fighter is too much [for him, despite already being stronger than a sanin](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10144000/9.jpg). This of course comes into play later when they flee vs Jiraiya, while making it believable. \n\nAnd then we have [in 144](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10144000/10.jpg), leaf jonin thinking how odd it is that the Akatsuki are acting so sloppily in their search.\n\nWe also have Kakashi commenting on how [itachi could kill him if he wanted](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10142000/17.jpg)\n\nAnd of course itachi indirectly leaking the Akatsuki are coming after the biju.\n\nAnd even if you feel like disregarding all that, the author himself said that Itachi was planned. \n\nI tried to be as comprehensive as possible. Let me know if I missed anything\n\nEdit: This is not my comment. I just copied and pasted from another one. The one who actually wrote it is u/SaintAhmad Full credits to him",

The Uchiha were right to attempt a coup since they were in existential danger. With Itachi and Shisui's mindset though I could see them preventing the coup though. Perhaps one of them shoud have challenged Fugaku to a battle for leadership of the clan. If Shisui won then he could move the clan out of the Land of Fire at night. If this were after Danzo killed Shisui then Fugaku probably wouldn't fight Itachi in which case he'd have to go along with Itachi's plan of leaving the village.\n\nSure the other clan members wouldn't like it but they'd have to win against Itachi or Shisui.\n\nDanzo wanted to kill them from the start and Koharu and Homura were power freaks. They literally said they had to kill them otherwise they'd lose their power.\n\nThe leaders of a country are supposed to serve the people but they and irl leaders think it's the other way around.",

Readers are obviously left wondering where that portion of the flashback fits in. \n\nAnd then, finally in ch 403, we get the reveal of itachi crying and the continuation of the flashback leading to the [sideways headband](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10403000/20.jpg), that was first shown in ch 127. \n\nAlso worth noting in ch 221 that clear foreshadowing of the [coup de ta](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10221000/15.jpg) and also [Itachi\u2019s relationship with Sasuke](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10221000/19.jpg) is shown.\n\nGoing further, [the first time we see Itachi on screen](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10139000/1.jpg), Kisame is snidely questioning his loyalty. We know that Kisame is the most loyal of the Akatsuki, and the Akatsuki grunt pairings are purposefully made to oppose each other. (Money/materialism vs Religion/higher purpose, ephemeral vs eternal art. Kisame was loyal to the cause, while Itachi was treacherous. Itachi needed to act undercover, as to not raise any suspicion. \n\nAlso, in chapter 140, [we get confirmation that itachi is stronger than Orochimaru, and therefor stronger than Sanin level](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10140000/5.jpg)\n\nBut then we have Itachi downplaying himself and agreeing that a sanin level fighter is too much [for him, despite already being stronger than a sanin](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10144000/9.jpg). This of course comes into play later when they flee vs Jiraiya, while making it believable. \n\nAnd then we have [in 144](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10144000/10.jpg), leaf jonin thinking how odd it is that the Akatsuki are acting so sloppily in their search.\n\nWe also have Kakashi commenting on how [itachi could kill him if he wanted](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10142000/17.jpg)\n\nAnd of course itachi indirectly leaking the Akatsuki are coming after the biju.\n\nAnd even if you feel like disregarding all that, the author himself said that Itachi was planned. \n\nI tried to be as comprehensive as possible. Let me know if I missed anything\n\nEdit: This is not my comment. I just copied and pasted from another one. The one who actually wrote it is u/SaintAhmad Full credits to him",

The Uchiha were right to attempt a coup since they were in existential danger. With Itachi and Shisui's mindset though I could see them preventing the coup though. Perhaps one of them shoud have challenged Fugaku to a battle for leadership of the clan. If Shisui won then he could move the clan out of the Land of Fire at night. If this were after Danzo killed Shisui then Fugaku probably wouldn't fight Itachi in which case he'd have to go along with Itachi's plan of leaving the village.\n\nSure the other clan members wouldn't like it but they'd have to win against Itachi or Shisui.\n\nDanzo wanted to kill them from the start and Koharu and Homura were power freaks. They literally said they had to kill them otherwise they'd lose their power.\n\nThe leaders of a country are supposed to serve the people but they and irl leaders think it's the other way around.",

I mean most lines up, but the anime doesn't ignore (all) filler after the fact? So saying it isn't cannon is basically telling the millions of people who will only ever watch the anime that they can't have a discussion about the show they love. Sorry but most of these discussions are about the anime not manga  so you kinda gotta let that slide when discussing.",

Readers are obviously left wondering where that portion of the flashback fits in. \n\nAnd then, finally in ch 403, we get the reveal of itachi crying and the continuation of the flashback leading to the [sideways headband](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10403000/20.jpg), that was first shown in ch 127. \n\nAlso worth noting in ch 221 that clear foreshadowing of the [coup de ta](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10221000/15.jpg) and also [Itachi\u2019s relationship with Sasuke](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10221000/19.jpg) is shown.\n\nGoing further, [the first time we see Itachi on screen](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10139000/1.jpg), Kisame is snidely questioning his loyalty. We know that Kisame is the most loyal of the Akatsuki, and the Akatsuki grunt pairings are purposefully made to oppose each other. (Money/materialism vs Religion/higher purpose, ephemeral vs eternal art. Kisame was loyal to the cause, while Itachi was treacherous. Itachi needed to act undercover, as to not raise any suspicion. \n\nAlso, in chapter 140, [we get confirmation that itachi is stronger than Orochimaru, and therefor stronger than Sanin level](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10140000/5.jpg)\n\nBut then we have Itachi downplaying himself and agreeing that a sanin level fighter is too much [for him, despite already being stronger than a sanin](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10144000/9.jpg). This of course comes into play later when they flee vs Jiraiya, while making it believable. \n\nAnd then we have [in 144](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10144000/10.jpg), leaf jonin thinking how odd it is that the Akatsuki are acting so sloppily in their search.\n\nWe also have Kakashi commenting on how [itachi could kill him if he wanted](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10142000/17.jpg)\n\nAnd of course itachi indirectly leaking the Akatsuki are coming after the biju.\n\nAnd even if you feel like disregarding all that, the author himself said that Itachi was planned. \n\nI tried to be as comprehensive as possible. Let me know if I missed anything\n\nEdit: This is not my comment. I just copied and pasted from another one. The one who actually wrote it is u/SaintAhmad Full credits to him",

So Itachi intended to give Sasuke his eyes to form the EMS.

Instead Itachi uses Kotoamatsukami on himself to break Kabutos control of revived Edo Tensei Itachi. But that was never its intended purpose.",

The Uchiha were right to attempt a coup since they were in existential danger. With Itachi and Shisui's mindset though I could see them preventing the coup though. Perhaps one of them shoud have challenged Fugaku to a battle for leadership of the clan. If Shisui won then he could move the clan out of the Land of Fire at night. If this were after Danzo killed Shisui then Fugaku probably wouldn't fight Itachi in which case he'd have to go along with Itachi's plan of leaving the village.\n\nSure the other clan members wouldn't like it but they'd have to win against Itachi or Shisui.\n\nDanzo wanted to kill them from the start and Koharu and Homura were power freaks. They literally said they had to kill them otherwise they'd lose their power.\n\nThe leaders of a country are supposed to serve the people but they and irl leaders think it's the other way around.",

I mean most lines up, but the anime doesn't ignore (all) filler after the fact? So saying it isn't cannon is basically telling the millions of people who will only ever watch the anime that they can't have a discussion about the show they love. Sorry but most of these discussions are about the anime not manga  so you kinda gotta let that slide when discussing.",

Readers are obviously left wondering where that portion of the flashback fits in. \n\nAnd then, finally in ch 403, we get the reveal of itachi crying and the continuation of the flashback leading to the [sideways headband](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10403000/20.jpg), that was first shown in ch 127. \n\nAlso worth noting in ch 221 that clear foreshadowing of the [coup de ta](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10221000/15.jpg) and also [Itachi\u2019s relationship with Sasuke](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10221000/19.jpg) is shown.\n\nGoing further, [the first time we see Itachi on screen](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10139000/1.jpg), Kisame is snidely questioning his loyalty. We know that Kisame is the most loyal of the Akatsuki, and the Akatsuki grunt pairings are purposefully made to oppose each other. (Money/materialism vs Religion/higher purpose, ephemeral vs eternal art. Kisame was loyal to the cause, while Itachi was treacherous. Itachi needed to act undercover, as to not raise any suspicion. \n\nAlso, in chapter 140, [we get confirmation that itachi is stronger than Orochimaru, and therefor stronger than Sanin level](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10140000/5.jpg)\n\nBut then we have Itachi downplaying himself and agreeing that a sanin level fighter is too much [for him, despite already being stronger than a sanin](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10144000/9.jpg). This of course comes into play later when they flee vs Jiraiya, while making it believable. \n\nAnd then we have [in 144](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10144000/10.jpg), leaf jonin thinking how odd it is that the Akatsuki are acting so sloppily in their search.\n\nWe also have Kakashi commenting on how [itachi could kill him if he wanted](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10142000/17.jpg)\n\nAnd of course itachi indirectly leaking the Akatsuki are coming after the biju.\n\nAnd even if you feel like disregarding all that, the author himself said that Itachi was planned. \n\nI tried to be as comprehensive as possible. Let me know if I missed anything\n\nEdit: This is not my comment. I just copied and pasted from another one. The one who actually wrote it is u/SaintAhmad Full credits to him",

I mean most lines up, but the anime doesn't ignore (all) filler after the fact? So saying it isn't cannon is basically telling the millions of people who will only ever watch the anime that they can't have a discussion about the show they love. Sorry but most of these discussions are about the anime not manga  so you kinda gotta let that slide when discussing.",

                            "body": "People that think he\u2019s was retconned simply didn\u2019t pay attention to the manga. \n\nCh. 7 of the manga [foreshadows Itachi crying](https://preview.redd.it/w0d3s40twv371.jpg?width=602&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c69b8d263cac0060faf459196fa520a92e6e5505)\nWhich is ultimately revealed in chapter [chapter 403](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10403000/21.jpg) Note: the Japanese is the exact same for both (that moment.. crying)\n\nAdditionally, we get a flashback in ch. 127 showing [Itachi with his headband sideways](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10127000/17.jpg)\n\nLater, when Sasuke\u2019s backstory is fleshed out, [in chapter 146](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10146000/11.jpg), the flashback ends around Itachi telling Sasuke to hate him, yet no feature of the sideways headband portion of the flashback. \n\nAgain later, [in chapter 225](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10225000/5.jpg), the flashback gets slightly extended, but still no imagery of the sideways headband. Readers are obviously left wondering where that portion of the flashback fits in. \n\nAnd then, finally in ch 403, we get the reveal of itachi crying and the continuation of the flashback leading to the [sideways headband](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10403000/20.jpg), that was first shown in ch 127. \n\nAlso worth noting in ch 221 that clear foreshadowing of the [coup de ta](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10221000/15.jpg) and also [Itachi\u2019s relationship with Sasuke](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10221000/19.jpg) is shown.\n\nGoing further, [the first time we see Itachi on screen](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10139000/1.jpg), Kisame is snidely questioning his loyalty. We know that Kisame is the most loyal of the Akatsuki, and the Akatsuki grunt pairings are purposefully made to oppose each other. (Money/materialism vs Religion/higher purpose, ephemeral vs eternal art. Kisame was loyal to the cause, while Itachi was treacherous. Itachi needed to act undercover, as to not raise any suspicion. \n\nAlso, in chapter 140, [we get confirmation that itachi is stronger than Orochimaru, and therefor stronger than Sanin level](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10140000/5.jpg)\n\nBut then we have Itachi downplaying himself and agreeing that a sanin level fighter is too much [for him, despite already being stronger than a sanin](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10144000/9.jpg). This of course comes into play later when they flee vs Jiraiya, while making it believable. \n\nAnd then we have [in 144](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10144000/10.jpg), leaf jonin thinking how odd it is that the Akatsuki are acting so sloppily in their search.\n\nWe also have Kakashi commenting on how [itachi could kill him if he wanted](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10142000/17.jpg)\n\nAnd of course itachi indirectly leaking the Akatsuki are coming after the biju.\n\nAnd even if you feel like disregarding all that, the author himself said that Itachi was planned. \n\nI tried to be as comprehensive as possible. Let me know if I missed anything\n\nEdit: This is not my comment. I just copied and pasted from another one. The one who actually wrote it is u/SaintAhmad Full credits to him",

I mean most lines up, but the anime doesn't ignore (all) filler after the fact? So saying it isn't cannon is basically telling the millions of people who will only ever watch the anime that they can't have a discussion about the show they love. Sorry but most of these discussions are about the anime not manga  so you kinda gotta let that slide when discussing.",

                    "body": "People that think he\u2019s was retconned simply didn\u2019t pay attention to the manga. \n\nCh. 7 of the manga [foreshadows Itachi crying](https://preview.redd.it/w0d3s40twv371.jpg?width=602&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c69b8d263cac0060faf459196fa520a92e6e5505)\nWhich is ultimately revealed in chapter [chapter 403](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10403000/21.jpg) Note: the Japanese is the exact same for both (that moment.. crying)\n\nAdditionally, we get a flashback in ch. 127 showing [Itachi with his headband sideways](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10127000/17.jpg)\n\nLater, when Sasuke\u2019s backstory is fleshed out, [in chapter 146](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10146000/11.jpg), the flashback ends around Itachi telling Sasuke to hate him, yet no feature of the sideways headband portion of the flashback. \n\nAgain later, [in chapter 225](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10225000/5.jpg), the flashback gets slightly extended, but still no imagery of the sideways headband. Readers are obviously left wondering where that portion of the flashback fits in. \n\nAnd then, finally in ch 403, we get the reveal of itachi crying and the continuation of the flashback leading to the [sideways headband](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10403000/20.jpg), that was first shown in ch 127. \n\nAlso worth noting in ch 221 that clear foreshadowing of the [coup de ta](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10221000/15.jpg) and also [Itachi\u2019s relationship with Sasuke](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10221000/19.jpg) is shown.\n\nGoing further, [the first time we see Itachi on screen](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10139000/1.jpg), Kisame is snidely questioning his loyalty. We know that Kisame is the most loyal of the Akatsuki, and the Akatsuki grunt pairings are purposefully made to oppose each other. (Money/materialism vs Religion/higher purpose, ephemeral vs eternal art. Kisame was loyal to the cause, while Itachi was treacherous. Itachi needed to act undercover, as to not raise any suspicion. \n\nAlso, in chapter 140, [we get confirmation that itachi is stronger than Orochimaru, and therefor stronger than Sanin level](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10140000/5.jpg)\n\nBut then we have Itachi downplaying himself and agreeing that a sanin level fighter is too much [for him, despite already being stronger than a sanin](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10144000/9.jpg). This of course comes into play later when they flee vs Jiraiya, while making it believable. \n\nAnd then we have [in 144](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10144000/10.jpg), leaf jonin thinking how odd it is that the Akatsuki are acting so sloppily in their search.\n\nWe also have Kakashi commenting on how [itachi could kill him if he wanted](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10142000/17.jpg)\n\nAnd of course itachi indirectly leaking the Akatsuki are coming after the biju.\n\nAnd even if you feel like disregarding all that, the author himself said that Itachi was planned. \n\nI tried to be as comprehensive as possible. Let me know if I missed anything\n\nEdit: This is not my comment. I just copied and pasted from another one. The one who actually wrote it is u/SaintAhmad Full credits to him",

            "body": "People that think he\u2019s was retconned simply didn\u2019t pay attention to the manga. \n\nCh. 7 of the manga [foreshadows Itachi crying](https://preview.redd.it/w0d3s40twv371.jpg?width=602&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c69b8d263cac0060faf459196fa520a92e6e5505)\nWhich is ultimately revealed in chapter [chapter 403](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10403000/21.jpg) Note: the Japanese is the exact same for both (that moment.. crying)\n\nAdditionally, we get a flashback in ch. 127 showing [Itachi with his headband sideways](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10127000/17.jpg)\n\nLater, when Sasuke\u2019s backstory is fleshed out, [in chapter 146](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10146000/11.jpg), the flashback ends around Itachi telling Sasuke to hate him, yet no feature of the sideways headband portion of the flashback. \n\nAgain later, [in chapter 225](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10225000/5.jpg), the flashback gets slightly extended, but still no imagery of the sideways headband. Readers are obviously left wondering where that portion of the flashback fits in. \n\nAnd then, finally in ch 403, we get the reveal of itachi crying and the continuation of the flashback leading to the [sideways headband](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10403000/20.jpg), that was first shown in ch 127. \n\nAlso worth noting in ch 221 that clear foreshadowing of the [coup de ta](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10221000/15.jpg) and also [Itachi\u2019s relationship with Sasuke](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10221000/19.jpg) is shown.\n\nGoing further, [the first time we see Itachi on screen](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10139000/1.jpg), Kisame is snidely questioning his loyalty. We know that Kisame is the most loyal of the Akatsuki, and the Akatsuki grunt pairings are purposefully made to oppose each other. (Money/materialism vs Religion/higher purpose, ephemeral vs eternal art. Kisame was loyal to the cause, while Itachi was treacherous. Itachi needed to act undercover, as to not raise any suspicion. \n\nAlso, in chapter 140, [we get confirmation that itachi is stronger than Orochimaru, and therefor stronger than Sanin level](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10140000/5.jpg)\n\nBut then we have Itachi downplaying himself and agreeing that a sanin level fighter is too much [for him, despite already being stronger than a sanin](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10144000/9.jpg). This of course comes into play later when they flee vs Jiraiya, while making it believable. \n\nAnd then we have [in 144](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10144000/10.jpg), leaf jonin thinking how odd it is that the Akatsuki are acting so sloppily in their search.\n\nWe also have Kakashi commenting on how [itachi could kill him if he wanted](https://cdn.readnaruto.com/file/mangap/3069/10142000/17.jpg)\n\nAnd of course itachi indirectly leaking the Akatsuki are coming after the biju.\n\nAnd even if you feel like disregarding all that, the author himself said that Itachi was planned. \n\nI tried to be as comprehensive as possible. Let me know if I missed anything\n\nEdit: This is not my comment. I just copied and pasted from another one. The one who actually wrote it is u/SaintAhmad Full credits to him",

I mean most lines up, but the anime doesn't ignore (all) filler after the fact? So saying it isn't cannon is basically telling the millions of people who will only ever watch the anime that they can't have a discussion about the show they love. Sorry but most of these discussions are about the anime not manga  so you kinda gotta let that slide when discussing.",

I mean most lines up, but the anime doesn't ignore (all) filler after the fact? So saying it isn't cannon is basically telling the millions of people who will only ever watch the anime that they can't have a discussion about the show they love. Sorry but most of these discussions are about the anime not manga  so you kinda gotta let that slide when discussing.",
