Show this to your barber as you cut your hair to these proportions and work up to the length Brad has it.\n\nSecond, you have to have healthy hair. Some general tips are to eat healthy (emphasis on fruits + nuts) , shampoo infrequently, avoid high heat blow-drying, and use hair oils. Personally I like We Are Paradoxx\u2019s Hangover Hair Elixir. \n\nLastly, you have to style correctly. With towel dried hair, apply hair oil. Then apply a conditioner or prestyler to get the hair as light as possible before finding your part with a comb and blow drying on medium heat while brushing. Finish by using a light clay, (I would recommend Layrite\u2019s Matte Cream) and possibly some low-hold hairspray. \n\nBonus: watch youtubers who know what they\u2019re doing to keep hair healthy and achieve the style you want. I recommend Luca Santangelo, as he taught me most everything I do! He has a video that goes far more in-depth about what to eat for healthy hair. Good luck!",
