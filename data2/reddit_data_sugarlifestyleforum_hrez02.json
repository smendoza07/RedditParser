    "body": "I just found out a girl I know went missing. I met her here, through this subreddit. We grabbed beers together and had dinner. She\u2019s been missing for almost two weeks. This is such a small town. I haven\u2019t seen her in a year. On social media she looks too pretty. I wonder what happened with her long term spoiling boyfriend? Why was she flying?\n\nShe chose a rose to accompany her name in my phone. \n\nPlease protect yourself. Do your research. Create a financial foundation. Address the roots of your unhealthy behavior patterns. \n\nFucking let someone know where you are.",
