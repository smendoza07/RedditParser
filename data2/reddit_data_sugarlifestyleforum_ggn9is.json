    "body": "\\[I was approached by one of the mods to make this post for the general SLF community. It is archived with a link in the SLF wiki.\\]\n\nHey, everyone! We're often asked on SLF to review profiles and provide feedback on pics. I composed a post with all sorts of general ideas for ladies to think about before they take their pics. This is a list of recommendations and suggestions compiled from numerous threads over the past 2 months or so.\n\nRemember your goal: to have the best possible photos on your profile to get quality SDs to look at your profile and message you.\n\n\u2022  You want at least two types of photos. One is a clear, full facial pic. The other is a clear, head-to-toe full body pic.\n\n\u2022  You want your pics to be honest. No deceptive camera angles or poses to hide your weight.\n\n\u2022  You want your pics to be recent. Not 5 years and 20 lbs ago.\n\n\u2022  You want a nice, engaging smile. \u201cResting bitch face\u201d or immature duck lips or stuck out tongues are not appealing.\n\n\u2022  You want your pics to be without Snapchat or Instagram filters. No SD wants to date a puppy dog with Harry Potter glasses.\n\n\u2022  You want to be aware of light and shadow. Avoid glares or weird lighting that make you look washed out. Or shadows that obscure you.\n\n\u2022  You want the pics to be clear. Avoid blurry, low resolution and pixilated photos.\n\n\u2022  You want the pic to be about what you look like, not about being artsy. Don't use \"dutch angles,\" B&W or sepia tone filters. You can show us your portfolio later to share your artistic creativity.\n\n\u2022  You want to the obvious focal point of the ppic. Not the background scenery. Don't take your photo from 50 yards away.\n\n\u2022  You want your full body pic to be in a form fitting outfit. Tight dress, swimwear, athletic gear. A baggy sweater and sweats won\u2019t help. SDs want an idea for your bust-waist-hips ratio. \\*\\* Some have suggested that swimwear photos at the pool or at the beach ('in the wild' if you will) are stronger and more appealing than swimwear pics in a bathroom mirror selfie.\n\n\u2022  You want to clean your mirror of smudges and streaks.\n\n\u2022  You want to be aware of the background. Some SDs get turned off by piles of dirty laundry or stacks of empty White Claw cans. Or cribs / pack & plays / toys if you have a child.\n\n\u2022   You want to avoid group photos or photos with other people. Even if they are cropped out or blurred out. SDs don\u2019t want to see you with a guy. And the others in your pics haven\u2019t consented to their images being used on a sugar website. \\*\\* Also avoid group pics because what if YOU are not the most attractive one in the photo? Some SDs have commented they have seen this.\n\n\u2022  You want to avoid using photos that are on your other social media accounts or the internet in general. Reverse imaging can allow strangers on the internet to find out who you are.\n\n\u2022  You want to choose a great photo as your main profile pic. When an SD is scrolling through search results, he's only seeing a thumbnail. Make sure that thumbnail is as compelling as possible.\n\n\u2022  You *may* want to wear a nice dress in a pic. Some SDs want to see what you look liked dressed up for a nice dinner out\n\n\u2022  You *may* want to include a fun or candid pic that shows of your personality... playing the guitar, with headphones on as you game, reading your favorite book, taking fresh cookies out of the oven, etc. Especially if it plays off something written in your \u201cAbout Me\u201d or \u201cSeeking.\u201d This can help establish that you are \"real.\"\n\n\u2022  You *may* want to avoid pics in lingerie, or overly sexually suggestive photos (T&A shots). Some SDs think it comes across as trashy. There are fine lines between sultry and slutty.\n\n\u2022  You *may* want to include a local spot or landmark in your town in the background. This can help local SDs know that you are \u201creal.\u201d\n\n\u2022  You *may* want to hide your face in your pics for discretion. Some use an emoji or a black bar to cover their face. Others crop the facial pic at the nose. Some share their full facial pics as private pics on SA, while others will text full facial pics later off site.\n\n\u2022  You *may* want to be careful with private pics. You can easily get numerous requests to see your private pics without any conversations. If there isn't a compelling reason to make them private, consider just making them public.\n\n\u2022  You *may* want to be careful with professional photos. SDs may think you are a scammer and you stole someone else's professional pics from social media / the internet. Some SDs think it gives off a professional / SW vibe.\n\n\u2022  Remember: 3-4 great pics are better than 10 mediocre pics.\n\nEdited: This document is a work in progress, and we're always looking for additional suggestions.",

            "body": "I wanted to add some tidbits and tips both from the perspective of a professional women's portrait photographer as well as a marketer.\n\n*Before we can even talk about how to take the photos, we need to plan what we're going to wear!*\n\nClothing tips for quality portraits (and sugar dates in general):  \n**- Dress for the sugar relationship you want, not the one you have.** If you're trying to attract high-quality men, dress so they can take you places outside of the bedroom.  \n\\- You don't have to spend a lot to get high-quality designer clothes. ROSS, Marshalls, Burlington Coat Factory, TJMaxx, etc. Don't shop in the youth section, go to the women's section. Dresses are always a safe bet to really add elegance to your appearance.  \n\\- Heals or wedges always dress up an outfit. You'd be amazed how many SDs have a foot/shoe fetish so make sure your feel are pampered before you do your pictures.  \n\\- No jeans unless you're really trying to attract an outdoorsy or young SD. If you do wear jeans, keep it classy and make sure they fit well and dress them up with a nice top and heels.  \n\\- Consider one picture in business casual attire so they know you can look the part if they're married and seeking something discrete.  \n\\- Choose one 'asset' to emphasize in each photo. If you have a low-cut top, have a longer skirt or pants on. If your dress is a little short, keep the girls covered and add some mystery.  \n\\- Choose colors that are flattering on you. You can find this information on YouTube or Pinterest.\n\n*Okay, now that we have some general guidelines for attire, let's talk about planning and selecting your photos. Remember, we're marketing ourselves so we want our pictures to also portray the type of experience we're seeking and the type of SD we want.*\n\nSome examples of this would be:  \n\\- Seeking an outdoorsy SD who loves travel = Pictures of SB hiking in a fitted athletic outfit with her hair and makeup done but not 'overdone'.  \n\\- Seeking an SD with a boat = SB dressed in sailing attire walking the boardwalk at sunset, a sundress on the patio of a beach cafe, SB in a pool with a classy hat.  \n\\- Seeking SD who travels in luxury = SB at a wine vineyard, museum, or foreign landmark  \n\\- Seeking an SD who is younger and loves to party = Pictures at a RAVE in carnival attire, concert, or at a high-end bar dressed to impress.  \n\\- A whale who lives a traditional business executive lifestyle = SB golfing, playing tennis, or at a classy cafe while dressed in a fitted but modest dress appropriate for afternoon tea.\n\n*Now that you've planned out 3-4 outfits and pictures you want to take to portray what you're offering/seeking, it's time to think about the details.*\n\nTips for good photos (in addition to the ones listed above)  \n\\- Hire a photographer or ask a friend. Because you want a good photo of your full body, this is going to be the best way to take these pictures on location.  \n\\- Choose several, outfits and locations. If at all possible, avoid taking all the pictures on the same day so you can have a little variation to your hair and makeup.  \n\\- Consider choosing outfits that reflect different seasons  \n\\- If you take the time to do your makeup well and take the photos in good lighting, you shouldn't need much editing aside from removing a few zits that won't be there next week. *Please, please, do not over soften your skin or add a lot of digital makeup, this is worse than having no retouching at all and will make SDs pass up your profile*  \n\\- Make sure your photos and style look somewhat consistent and recent. You want to look the same or better when you show up for your M&G.  \n\\- If you know how to take a good selfie, you can add one or two to your profile to show that you look really similar to the way you do in your professional photos... but make sure there isn't a huge difference \"We only look as good as our worst photo\".  \n\n\nPhoto technical tips:  \n\\- Clean backgrounds that aren't distracting  \n\\- Blurry background  \n\\- Good lighting, especially on your face (look on YouTube for more tips and examples)  \n\\- Flattering (but not deceiving) posing  \n\\- Smile!!!!  \n\\- Headshot (profile pic), 2/3rds portrait, and at least two full-body photos.",

I don't know any who prefer girls with Lizzo curves. \n\n>I'm willing to make some procedures to look better if they want to but have no idea where to start to meet someone. any advice?\n\nI don't know about procedures. I wouldn't encourage anyone to get plastic surgery just to get into sugaring. But eating healthier and exercising (boring stuff to loose weight and get more trim) is always a good idea. \n\nYou should start here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/wiki/advice/new\\_sbs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/wiki/advice/new_sbs/)",

I had an answer (that isn\u2019t scammy but actually makes sense) for why I wouldn\u2019t share my pics even over text. \n\nI initiated and we had a relatively long chat on SA (paragraphs), moved to text (same day) where we solidified plans for a M&G that same week. He sent me the reservation with his first name and I just showed up (he was late!). By the end, we\u2019d already set up the next date. \n\nI\u2019ve asked him why he even responded to me without pics (this was not his MO). His answer: I was the first person that didn\u2019t respond with one word answers, ask him to meet that night, ask him to send money or how much he was willing to spoil.
