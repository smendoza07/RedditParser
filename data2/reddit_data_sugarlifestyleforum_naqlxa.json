    "body": "I\u2019ve been with my current SD for 2 months now. At first he was pretty consistent with my weekly allowance, he had a little slip and i asked him if he was sure this was something he could handle and he assured me he could. For the past 3 weeks i have had to remind him to pay me allowance, this week i got a bit fed up because as a college student starting a new semester i have to pay for books and materials and he had yet to give me my weekly allowance. Mind you we spend lots of time together, i even sleep over at his place a few nights a week. When i called him out on it and told him i should not have to remind him if he truly valued our relationship, he acted like a victim and like i was just accusing him of nonsense. He then told me the amount he had began giving me weekly at the start of our relationship is all that he could handle to give me for TWO WEEKS and if it wasn\u2019t enough than it just wasn\u2019t. Why start something a certain way just to change it once you become attached? For the amount of time we spend together I\u2019m starting to think this relationship is no longer mutually beneficial. How can i break it to him that its not worth it to me ? We did establish in the beginning that I was used to a weekly allowance of $*** and that I didn\u2019t want an allowance that i could make easily by just working a couple extra days at my 9-5 , at first he was willing and did give me said amount for the first few weeks and now he is saying that amount for two weeks is what he finds reasonable.",

You expectation is reasonable, unreasonable, doesn't matter - he agreed in the hope that you'd get attached before he cut it back from $x per week to $x per two weeks (and later, to $x per month... or worse).\n\nIt's important to recognize his manipulation, because there's really no sympathy for this guy, and no reason to dump him \"kindly\" - he's trying to take advantage, it's not like you were together for a year and he hit a bump in his business along the way.",

If you're really not able to stick with what we agreed to originally, I'm going to have to look for a different arrangement. Is there any way you can make it work?\n\nThen after whatever version of \"no\" he gives:\n\n>I understand where you're coming from. It really sucks that we couldn't make it work. If you ever change your mind in the future, you know how to reach me. \n\nIdea being that you are firm but non-confrontational about your requirements. Then you let him down easily, but again firmly, when he can't meet your requirements. Don't let emotions cloud things here - you two had an agreement, you've been over-delivering, and he's been under-delivering. He's taking advantage. So be firm and stand up for what you both agreed that you deserve.",

Framing it as a constraint might upset him - it's pointing out his lack of resources, and even if it's true, it could cause an emotional knee-jerk reaction.

Framing it as a pure choice vs a financial constraint. \n\nI chose to frame it the way I did because I think it's the more gentle approach and (maybe) nudges him to think of the ways he might be able to make it work even if he currently believe he can't. Framing it as a constraint might upset him - it's pointing out his lack of resources, and even if it's true, it could cause an emotional knee-jerk reaction. Like salt in the wound - not only am I breaking up with you, but it's because you're poor. \n\nBut I could be overthinking it, and maybe just being more direct would be better.",
