I know guys with a negative net worth, who wear clothes that cost 5 benjamins and drive a leased 2020 Mercedes SUV. \n\nWhen I am in the aisles of CVS in downtown Philadelphia, I am completely indistinguishable from the homeless guys who are also shopping there with their bag of quarters.\n\nTLDR: there is no way to know someone's finances.

Add in the strong feelings that develop over time and how awesome it is to see someone make their dreams come true. \n\nThis is not to say someone that isn't wealthy can't be very generous. It's just much easier to be generous when it's a very small percentage of your regular expenses.\n\nIf a SB wants to focus on very wealthy SDs more power to them. The same for SDs that want runway models. As long as you know there are much fewer of them in the bowl who's being hurt?",

I just saw this subreddit and your comment pop up in my feed and was curious\u2026\nTo preface, hopefully this doesn\u2019t come across rude, but when you\u2019re looking for guys to be your sugar daddy is the process of dating them purely transactional or does there need to be any physical/emotional chemistry also? \n\nIn addition, and more specifically related to your actually post; if both you and the guy that\u2019s interested in dating/supporting your lifestyle come across one another on a SB/SD website and therefore both understand there\u2019s going to be at least some degree of transactional foundation the relationship will be built upon prior to even speaking for the first time, why wouldn\u2019t it then make sense to iron out how much you want to charge for your time per hour/date/hookup or however is usually standard within these circles? \nFinally, while I understand why it\u2019d be beneficial for you to get involved with a SD, wouldn\u2019t a guy struggle with self esteem issues knowing despite the possible chemistry that might actually be genuine, the girl would dip out if he ever went bankrupt? \nI understand the argument that ALL relationships are inherently transactional on some level, but still\u2026I just would imagine it could get super weird when money and genuine feelings get conflated. \nSorry this ended up being long winded\u2026thanks in advance if you have time to respond!",

Some men like rail-thin women, some like BBW's, thick, short, tall, etc. \n\nWomen on the other hand, do have one standard male appearance that they all like for the most part.",

Men - esp in sugar relationships - are generally way less attractive than the women are. And its not rocket science to figure out why.

Ask any group of girlfriends about those specifics and you'll hear the responses all vary. My gf loves rap guys with face tats. Other gf cant enough of dad bod. Another gf of mine always goes for black guys. I tend to be hot for lean guys (not too much muscle or else its gross to me), stubble, dark or silver haired.

Whereas with beauty you can't do that cause as we've seen from some SDs in the sub they only find white girls attractive, which is fine. But that means if they say, \"exclude everyone I don't find attractive from the app\" that's all woc gone which many other men find attractive. You can say in the US don't include anyone who doesn't have x amount of disposable income, most women would find more money more appealing.

However I have friends who make 60k a year, who don't invest, and are certainly not wealthy, who would probably pay half of their income every month to date a girl who they considered otherwise out of their league.   \n\n\nNo offense to your post intended, just genuinely curious.",

I don't have seven figures in liquid assets or anything, but I make decent enough money to provide some support to get a woman who would otherwise be out of my league.

I don't have a family, and my day to day life is mostly lived pretty cheaply (small apartment, no car, not living a flashy lifestyle). I'm not very good at putting myself out there in \"normal\" situations, so why not try a method that takes away a lot of the guesswork and drama? We don't get in each other's way for most of the week with constant messaging (usually not much more than what's needed to set up our date). We don't worry about \"where is this going?\". It's just easy fun for both of us.\n\nBesides, as someone who has done both activities (it's legal where I live), there's definitely differences in how the hookers I've seen act, even one I've seen many times, vs my current SB. In turn there's a difference in how I act and perceive things. Yes, deep down both involve an understanding that there's some kind of transaction involved, but you might as well say that Arby's is just like a home cooked meal because both involve food.",

I just saw this subreddit and your comment pop up in my feed and was curious\u2026\nTo preface, hopefully this doesn\u2019t come across rude, but when you\u2019re looking for guys to be your sugar daddy is the process of dating them purely transactional or does there need to be any physical/emotional chemistry also? \n\nIn addition, and more specifically related to your actually post; if both you and the guy that\u2019s interested in dating/supporting your lifestyle come across one another on a SB/SD website and therefore both understand there\u2019s going to be at least some degree of transactional foundation the relationship will be built upon prior to even speaking for the first time, why wouldn\u2019t it then make sense to iron out how much you want to charge for your time per hour/date/hookup or however is usually standard within these circles? \nFinally, while I understand why it\u2019d be beneficial for you to get involved with a SD, wouldn\u2019t a guy struggle with self esteem issues knowing despite the possible chemistry that might actually be genuine, the girl would dip out if he ever went bankrupt? \nI understand the argument that ALL relationships are inherently transactional on some level, but still\u2026I just would imagine it could get super weird when money and genuine feelings get conflated. \nSorry this ended up being long winded\u2026thanks in advance if you have time to respond!",

Ask any group of girlfriends about those specifics and you'll hear the responses all vary. My gf loves rap guys with face tats. Other gf cant enough of dad bod. Another gf of mine always goes for black guys. I tend to be hot for lean guys (not too much muscle or else its gross to me), stubble, dark or silver haired.

Whereas with beauty you can't do that cause as we've seen from some SDs in the sub they only find white girls attractive, which is fine. But that means if they say, \"exclude everyone I don't find attractive from the app\" that's all woc gone which many other men find attractive.

Cost of living is expensive in 2021 and most middle class incomes can only cover the standard living costs of your own plus some extras for entertainment and leisure. But In sugar relationships an allowance, pricey gifts, or living expenses of the sugar baby are typically involved and that would be really difficult for a median income to cover in conjunction with their own life expenses. A \u201cSplenda\u201d daddy is more like it, which is fine as long as both parties are clear on expectations from the onset.",

I just saw this subreddit and your comment pop up in my feed and was curious\u2026\nTo preface, hopefully this doesn\u2019t come across rude, but when you\u2019re looking for guys to be your sugar daddy is the process of dating them purely transactional or does there need to be any physical/emotional chemistry also? \n\nIn addition, and more specifically related to your actually post; if both you and the guy that\u2019s interested in dating/supporting your lifestyle come across one another on a SB/SD website and therefore both understand there\u2019s going to be at least some degree of transactional foundation the relationship will be built upon prior to even speaking for the first time, why wouldn\u2019t it then make sense to iron out how much you want to charge for your time per hour/date/hookup or however is usually standard within these circles? \nFinally, while I understand why it\u2019d be beneficial for you to get involved with a SD, wouldn\u2019t a guy struggle with self esteem issues knowing despite the possible chemistry that might actually be genuine, the girl would dip out if he ever went bankrupt? \nI understand the argument that ALL relationships are inherently transactional on some level, but still\u2026I just would imagine it could get super weird when money and genuine feelings get conflated. \nSorry this ended up being long winded\u2026thanks in advance if you have time to respond!",

BTW I'm not saying I think that should be the case just that I don't see it as a super valid comparison. Whereas with beauty you can't do that cause as we've seen from some SDs in the sub they only find white girls attractive, which is fine. But that means if they say, \"exclude everyone I don't find attractive from the app\" that's all woc gone which many other men find attractive. You can say in the US don't include anyone who doesn't have x amount of disposable income, most women would find more money more appealing. It wouldn't really alienate any of your target market (or what OP feels is the target market). Sorry for not articulating myself properly.",

I just saw this subreddit and your comment pop up in my feed and was curious\u2026\nTo preface, hopefully this doesn\u2019t come across rude, but when you\u2019re looking for guys to be your sugar daddy is the process of dating them purely transactional or does there need to be any physical/emotional chemistry also? \n\nIn addition, and more specifically related to your actually post; if both you and the guy that\u2019s interested in dating/supporting your lifestyle come across one another on a SB/SD website and therefore both understand there\u2019s going to be at least some degree of transactional foundation the relationship will be built upon prior to even speaking for the first time, why wouldn\u2019t it then make sense to iron out how much you want to charge for your time per hour/date/hookup or however is usually standard within these circles? \nFinally, while I understand why it\u2019d be beneficial for you to get involved with a SD, wouldn\u2019t a guy struggle with self esteem issues knowing despite the possible chemistry that might actually be genuine, the girl would dip out if he ever went bankrupt? \nI understand the argument that ALL relationships are inherently transactional on some level, but still\u2026I just would imagine it could get super weird when money and genuine feelings get conflated. \nSorry this ended up being long winded\u2026thanks in advance if you have time to respond!",

Whereas with beauty you can't do that cause as we've seen from some SDs in the sub they only find white girls attractive, which is fine.

Ask any group of girlfriends about those specifics and you'll hear the responses all vary. My gf loves rap guys with face tats. Other gf cant enough of dad bod. Another gf of mine always goes for black guys. I tend to be hot for lean guys (not too much muscle or else its gross to me), stubble, dark or silver haired.

Whereas with beauty you can't do that cause as we've seen from some SDs in the sub they only find white girls attractive, which is fine. But that means if they say, \"exclude everyone I don't find attractive from the app\" that's all woc gone which many other men find attractive. You can say in the US don't include anyone who doesn't have x amount of disposable income, most women would find more money more appealing.
