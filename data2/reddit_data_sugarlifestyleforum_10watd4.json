    "body": "Recently I've seen a lot of posts by confused girls. Maybe they are new to this world, maybe they just don't love themselves enough, maybe they're a bit insecure and maybe they're all of the above.\n\nKnow your worth. Never compromise. Be patient. Don't let men affect you and your self-esteem. Don't sell yourself short. Own yourself and your power. Remind yourself who you are and what your qualities are; you are more than just a pretty face. Never do anything you're not feeling comfortable of doing, no matter how much they're offering to pay you. Don't accept coffee for m&g; he should impress you and show you how much he is willing to spoil you. Don't leave empty handed, it took you two hours to be pretty for him, you kept your side of the bargain, he should appreciate it and offer you a gift in return. Most of these men just enjoy the company of a beautiful woman for free and never really planned to spoil you. No more. I'm sick and tired of people that claiming this is like a job interview. It's not. It's a deal that goes both ways. It's a first date, and you should be spoiled in a first date with a SD as you expected to be spoiled in a vanilla date. On the same note, don't agree to receive money only when the intimacy starts; they are not paying you for sex, they're paying for your company. If you feel a connection, intimacy will happen naturally, if you don't feel a connection, don't see him again. We're not here to use men, we here to have fun and being spoiled and have a relationship. Please don't be blinded by their empty promises, their words mean nothing; until you have money in your hand, don't give them anything for free. No pictures, no sexting and definitely no endless texts and calls.\n\n**Most important ** - please remember - money comes and goes, you live with yourself forever. If you have to second guess something, don't do it, it's not worth it. Listen to your intuition.\n\nLove you girls.",

I generally agree with the underlying sentiment.\n\n>I'm sick and tired of people that claiming this is like a job interview. It's not. It's a deal that goes both ways.\n\nWe must be going to different interviews, because interviews are always two-way interactions. If you \"know your worth\" as a prospective employee, then you and your interviewer are assessing if your skillset and personality are good matches. Interviews aren't desperate pandering. \n\nA good M&G *should* be like a *good interview*. A good interview does NOT feel like an interrogation. Good interviews are thorough but technical and efficiently select on *both sides* of the equation. Employers *want* excellent employees who will work hard and well with them. It costs time, money, and effort to search for, filter through, train, and hire good employees. \n\nIf you really \"know your worth\" and value your own time and energy, treat your M&Gs seriously, like an interview. Be timely. Honest. Put your best foot forward. Be yourself. Comport yourself with dignity and grace. And expect the same of your POT. A poor match is not personal, but approaching this intentionally and with respect is necessary to continuing on to a successful SR or politely declining and moving on.",

A M&G is a short, simple get together used to verify that the person is who the say they are, identify if there is any chemistry, and decide if each others expectations are reasonable.\n\nThat is why it should be short, such as a coffee date.  The last thing either of you want is to be stuck in a 3 hour dinner date with someone you can't stand, lied to you about themselves, and there is zero chemistry.\n\nAnd you would be surprised how many women show up to a M&G without spending any time whatsoever doing their part.  Sweats, no makeup, obviously tired and hungover.. etc... \n\nThe important part about a M&G is that it's part of the vetting process, NOT a first date.",

Lunch does not make the girl feel under pressure timing wise, and it is in a safe, public place. I research the expected allowances and PPM for the time being and am happy to agree those. If I like the girl and there is a connection, shopping and holidays and additional help also follow.\n\nBut having been scammed in the past, there is no way I\u2019ll agree to pay for an initial meeting.

Having sex with someone under the guise that there is an actual mutually beneficial relationship and then the \u201cSD\u201d John scamming the SB by not paying her is not akin to a \u201cSB\u201d rinsing a SD out of money and then not following through on sex with him. They are not nor will they ever be equal transgressions. So while you may have been scammed many times, an SB being scammed in that way even once is horribly traumatic. \n\nAnd for the record, I find plenty willing to pay me to meet me and I only agree to meet them if I\u2019m planning on having a relationship with them as I\u2019ve said before (before people once again call me a rinser).

            "body": "In your reply to someone you put:\n\n\"YES!!! The most amazing SD I had, took me to an amazing restaurant to   \nour first date; we had an amazing night together!!! And you know what   \nreally made me wanna see him again? The flowers that he gave me at the   \nbeginning of the date. The fact that he went to a shop and chose flowers  \n that he thought I will love, made me so happy, more than the ppm that   \nhe also chose to give me also at the end of the date. We just want to be  \n treated right \u2764\" \n\nNothing wrong with wanting that, just wondering if you are speaking of this one from a month ago(your post, different forum):\n\n\"\"I'm feeling stupid.We had a m&g on Tuesday for lunch, it was really nice and I kissed him. He immediately said that he wants to see me again and offered that we watch the game on Thursday (yesterday) and that we will cook dinner and have drinks, I agreed. He bought me a gift (a shirt of the team that I love) and it was very nice of him. We had a fun evening with laughs and drinks and pizza (we were too lazy to cook lol) and then at around midnight he said that he needed to go back home (he rented Airbnb) became he had to be early at the office. I was shocked, I told him that I thought he was going to sleep at the Airbnb, and he said that he prefers to sleep in his bed. Nothing happened between us. No intimacy.I left without the ppm and I'm mad. I spend 4-5 hours with this guy and I do believe time=money. It's not a m&g for a coffee or a drink. He didn't even offer to pay for the Uber. I'm feeling used and disgusting and I'm frustrated. When I left I massaged him: \"Hey.. I feel really uncomfortable to bring this issue up, but I thought that in the end we will spend the night together and I kinda counted on this money, I'm sorry if it's rude.. but as I told you, for me my time equal money and as much as I appreciate our time together and the gift, I will also really appreciate if you can transfer me ppm...\"And he didn't reply. I'm really mad at myself.\"\n\nNote that, in this post, in addition to your ire at getting time-rinsed, you state: \"It's not a m&g for a coffee or a drink\".(implication that this is not just a M&G but a date) Yet above, you state that there is no acceptable animal of that type? While getting time-rinsed by this guy is not acceptable behavior by an SD, tbh, coming here prior to a month ago and reading the advice that the forum member's frequently dole out (and the SD's sling it as much as the SB's) probably would have prevented you from falling prey to that. \n\nLastly, you state below: \"Why and why now? Because men take advantage of young SB and I will not sit still and let it happen.\"\n\nAnd you will do that exactly how? By posting on a forum you yourself also state you think has no actual SB's on it, they all having been banned? If you do not mind a piece of advice, once you release the idea that you can actively control others, and what happens to them and their actions, you will be a happier person. Be well.",

It doesn't change the fact that I stand behind everything I wrote.\"\n\nSo apparently it was not me that made you angry, since that was posted before my initial reply. Do you then think that any SB's here should take the advice of someone acting out of and motivated by anger, or should they wait for a post where you are not figuratively shouting \"Dracaris!!\" as if you were Missandei on GoT?",

No man worth my time (or yours) is wanting to meet at Starbucks to talk about the future over a double pump latte & low fat muffins. He\u2019s making reservations & ordering the best wine on the menu as we dive into what the structure of our arrangement will be. If we don\u2019t click - so be it. We\u2019ve both had an amazing night - you\u2019ve been wine and dined. Hopefully picked up a few skill for the next date & you move on. That is dating. Period. \n\nThis could get tricky because so many girls are impatient and don\u2019t play cards correctly\u2026. Asking about \u201cPPM\u201d in the first few chats also is not conducive finding a good arrangement.

The whole time equals money thing is a sex work mentality not a relationship mentality. instead of looking at things in such a short term mentality, think of the big picture in the long term.\n\nIf a SB can\u2019t invest one or two dates into getting to know a potential man without expectations of being compensated, then they don\u2019t deserve him or what he has to offer. Because being treated generous is not something a woman is entitled to, she has to show she\u2019s worth his generosity by her actions. Just like he has to show that he\u2019s worthy of being her lover.\n\nNo wonder so many women complain about only dealing with cheapskates. Because they approach this like a job, and because they expect to get paid for their time like a sex worker, they scare away all the really generous men and only get the cheapskates and John\u2019s.",

Almost nobody is looking to pay for your \"company\". The difference for most SDs (vs. Johns) is how the sex is delivered i.e. is it in the back of a Honda Civic or in a hotel room, after a nice dinner, with a girl who you have talked to for a bit and have some rudimentary connection to. Maybe some of the real SDs can step in and clarify if any of them are paying exclusively to get somebody's \"company\"?",

It is an interview where both parties acquire essential information on the possibilities of an arrangement. A business meeting if you like where none of the the participants owe the other anything.\n\n>No woman should accept coffee for a first date.\n\nI prefer lunch or dinner for the M&G. However, I don't think that any of us should tell others not accept a \"coffee date\" especially if there is a chance for an arrangement.\n\n>It takes us 2 hours to get ready, we often buy a new outfit, fix our nails and do our hair, what do you do in return?\n\nYou doll yourself up because you know very well that it increases your chances with the POT. Nobody owes you anything for maximizing your own chances. It takes time for me to get groomed, put some nice clothes and cologne on because I'd also like to impress you and you don't owe me anything for it. We both put some time and effort in to put our best face forward. Guess what, there's no participation trophy for it.",

(that's 'like', not 'the same as' - it's an analogy that helps to describe it, not to try to define it) -- because it is. your opinion won't change the opinion of everyone else. and if the average sd approaches this more like an interview (because it is more like an interview) than a date then it might be better to allow that analogy\n\nyes, it might take you 2 hours to get ready. i would never expect you to buy a new dress- and how would i know that the dress is new?\n\nwhat does a sd do in return? he clears his schedule. gets ready. drives to the location. and waits for the sb. orders food or drinks. every one of these things cost money. the hourly rate i'm giving up for spending my time at a m&g far exceeds the ppm you might expect for a real date. to say nothing of the struggle it takes sometimes to clear a couple of hours in a busy work day. this is why a lot of sds complain about a sb who no-shows. it's a very disrespectful slap in the face and shows a big disregard for other peoples' time\n\nyou're seeing this from your side. that's understandable. but you also need to see what the take on this is from the other side. you ask 'what does a sd do in return'? so you haven't considered what an sd does. you don't see the planning and effort that goes into a simple m&g from the sd perspective. as a result, you're annoyed and feel disrepected when things don't work out as you expected. well, the sd feels the same when things don't work out\n\ni do think both sds and sbs need to take a breath and relax a bit. this is a process, like interviewing candidates for a job as others have mentioned. it's a long, time consuming process for the employer to find the right candidate who has the proper training and experience, the skills for the job, the personality that fits in with the rest of the team and someone who can appreciate the company culture. interviews aren't fun. on either side. they're a lot of work. likewise, finding the right person for your sr is not always fun. and it takes a lot of work. it sucks when it doesn't work out. but when it does, it makes up for it. this is why we continue to go through the process\n\ngood luck and i hope you find your sd",

Newsflash: you don\u2019t need to spend 2 hours getting ready for a coffee M&G. \n\nSecond, no one is excited about a platonic dinner date with a hot woman if he\u2019s not going to try to start a relationship with you.   So, no, no one is out there setting up M&Gs solely for the purpose of being seen with you. \n\n*edit* You claim below that men are going out to their way to be seen with you in public\u2026 but you also complain about coffee M&Gs.  So, which is it?   Is dinner with you such a prize that men fall all over themselves for the opportunity, or are men just trying to get the M&G over quickly?  \n\nFinally, the \u201cno M&G fees\u201d topic has been discussed ad naseaum.  M&G fees are not going to become common, no matter what you say.   Don\u2019t blame us, blame the rinsers.   You\u2019ll get your first PPM when you are ready to start an intimate relationship, and no that is not the same as paying for sex.\n\n*edit* Since the post is locked and I can\u2019t reply, I\u2019ll edit here.   The idea of an uncompensated platonic M&G was pushed directly by Seeking when it more openly discussed sugar dating.   I understand that Seeking is not synonymous with the bowl, but this was certainly not a concept created by SLF.    Further, the idea of short, low commitment meetings before a full first date is not limited to sugar.  Some people do the same in vanilla dating.",

What exactly did he say that indicates that?\n\nOn coffee M&Gs, the main reason both SDs and SBs suggest it is because it's fast and lower effort.  He's right, right?  When I go on M&Gs, it's because that's what the SB wants -- is she an adult who is capable of making decisions that's right for her, or you know better?  Me personally, I'd rather do dinner.\n\nOn platonic M&Gs, most of us dislike them like we dislike any first date -- we do them because it's a necessary investment of time and effort to get to what we really want, a sugar relationship.   While I'm sure there's some tiny minority of guys who are doing this for free dinner purposes, most of what's ascribed to \"he just wanted to be seen with me\" is an SB making up for getting rejected by the SD, and making herself feel better by imagining he was never serious.  He's not saying anything bad that would make him the type of person no SB should be involved with, right?\n\nAnd he's 100% right that even if a pre-agreed to M&G fee weren't ludicrous on its face, it will never become standard, no matter what you say.  This is reality, not being mean.\n\nWhy is he a bad guy for saying any of this?",

Some will, but I would argue that it will be a very small percentage indeed, especially in areas where competition is fierce.\n\nI\u2019m absolutely not arguing for bad behaviour from SDs or for girls to be exploited. But the reality is that unless there is some compromise it will be very difficult for the vast majority of girls. I hope I\u2019m wrong but what you are describing is the fantasy scenario for most I think.\n\nIf any girl is confused, insecure or has a bad sense of self then they really shouldn\u2019t be in the lifestyle.",

You seem to be advocating on behalf of SBs in general, what is it that you seek that you are not advising others to? I cannot argue with the individual points in your post, they are valid goals for feeling self empowered and satisfied in the relationship, if (IMO) unrealistic. I think the biggest issue with the advice is \u201cNever compromise\u201d. Have you ever been in ANY relationship, romantic or otherwise where there was no degree of compromise? Never is a very definitive statement. And it is the same from the SD side. I certainly do not get everything that I want or would like. But I make the decision that it is better for me to compromise in order to stay in the relationship than stick to my guns and accept that it might end. I would love to be in a relationship where I got everything that I wanted and was totally respected at all times. But this is not reality I\u2019m afraid. People (both in a relationship) have moods, outside influences, chemical imbalances, emotions\u2026 \n\nI get it that the experience of a lot of girls right now is bad and that they are coming across a lot of unworthy \u2018SDs\u2019. But equally the SDs are complaining about the culture from their side. If neither of us is willing to compromise I don\u2019t really see how many good SRs there are going to be.",

Are you suggesting that they are not doing this through choice?

There are a lot of steps between deciding to create a profile on a site known for Sugar Dating and getting in bed with someone. At each of those steps there is a choice to make. If any (so-called) SD is actually forcing a woman to have sex that is known in most countries as a crime and should be reported. I\u2019m not saying that there are not vulnerable girls out there who may see this as the only option to get out of some financial difficulty, but that is still a choice.\n\nI think you have hit the nail on the head here to be honest and your post was not in vain. You have inadvertently revealed that there are SBs who consider that they are not doing this by choice, feel bad about it from the start and then to compensate want to be treated \u201cwithout compromise\u201d. But then they are entering into an agreement through a kind of deception. I think you just did the whole pseudo SB community a massive disservice by posting this.

Not trying to say that one is worse than the other but - actually Yk what I am saying that. Having sex with someone under the guise that there is an actual mutually beneficial relationship and then the \u201cSD\u201d John scamming the SB by not paying her is not akin to a \u201cSB\u201d rinsing a SD out of money and then not following through on sex with him. They are not nor will they ever be equal transgressions. So while you may have been scammed many times, an SB being scammed in that way even once is horribly traumatic. \n\nAnd for the record, I find plenty willing to pay me to meet me and I only agree to meet them if I\u2019m planning on having a relationship with them as I\u2019ve said before (before people once again call me a rinser). I\u2019m not out here booking back to back M&Gs all day long as my full time job, but I am done with time wasters and this has eliminated them for me. I know it\u2019s not what you all do here and you don\u2019t agree to it and that\u2019s fine. The SDs I meet have no problem with it.",

Sugaring is supposed to be different, involving a longer period of time, repeat dates and all being well a connection. Most SB\u2019s want that as much as a decent SD does. Accordingly, it\u2019s not too much to ask that the first M & G involves minimal commitment on each side. Your post puts SB\u2019s squarely in the escort expectations arena. I find it distasteful. And for every one of you who spouts that entitled stuff, there are several others who are happy to agree lunch or coffee and travel expenses with monetary rewards to follow on subsequent dates. Judging by your profile posts, involving indiscreet screenshots of arguments with guys and sometimes posting the man\u2019s handle too, I certainly wouldn\u2019t invite you on a date.",

Much more than the SB answers lol\"\n\nSo, who was this post for?\n\nAnd I see also that:\n\n\"Yeah, today I'm definitely motivated by anger. I'm half Italian, and I'm full of emotions. It doesn't change the fact that I stand behind everything I wrote.\"\n\nSo apparently it was not me that made you angry, since that was posted before my initial reply. Do you then think that any SB's here should take the advice of someone acting out of and motivated by anger, or should they wait for a post where you are not figuratively shouting \"Dracaris!!\" as if you were Missandei on GoT?",

She is saying a lot of the SDs are in the company of women half their age to 20 years younger, these women would not be \"hanging\" out with these men if they were not being paid. \n\nFurthermore, they are \"entertaining you.\" (The smart ones are not going to emotionally dump, complain about life, they're going to come off as easy going, fun, etc). \n\nEspecially if married, attached, where even if she is attracted or likes him it can't lead anywhere.\n\nEven platonic situations, if meeting publicly, you're being seen with an attractive younger woman, etc. What man wouldn't want to be seen with a hot younger woman, she should be paid, sex or not.\n\nIt comes down to her not being there if she wasn't paid.",

Almost nobody is looking to pay for your \"company\". The difference for most SDs (vs. Johns) is how the sex is delivered i.e. is it in the back of a Honda Civic or in a hotel room, after a nice dinner, with a girl who you have talked to for a bit and have some rudimentary connection to. Maybe some of the real SDs can step in and clarify if any of them are paying exclusively to get somebody's \"company\"?",

It's not allowed, but I could provide pointers to every one of these, easy enough to find though.\n\nThat's why many SBs choose not to participate there -- it's not sugar, it's a payment maximizing manipulation & strategy sub that touches on other topics accidentally.

It provides a lot of insight into what's going on here.\n\nNot that some of what you wrote isn't totally valid (and other parts, typical \"female strategy\" venting).

It is an interview where both parties acquire essential information on the possibilities of an arrangement. A business meeting if you like where none of the the participants owe the other anything.\n\n>No woman should accept coffee for a first date.\n\nI prefer lunch or dinner for the M&G. However, I don't think that any of us should tell others not accept a \"coffee date\" especially if there is a chance for an arrangement.\n\n>It takes us 2 hours to get ready, we often buy a new outfit, fix our nails and do our hair, what do you do in return?\n\nYou doll yourself up because you know very well that it increases your chances with the POT. Nobody owes you anything for maximizing your own chances. It takes time for me to get groomed, put some nice clothes and cologne on because I'd also like to impress you and you don't owe me anything for it. We both put some time and effort in to put our best face forward. Guess what, there's no participation trophy for it.",

What exactly did he say that indicates that?\n\nOn coffee M&Gs, the main reason both SDs and SBs suggest it is because it's fast and lower effort.  He's right, right?  When I go on M&Gs, it's because that's what the SB wants -- is she an adult who is capable of making decisions that's right for her, or you know better?  Me personally, I'd rather do dinner.\n\nOn platonic M&Gs, most of us dislike them like we dislike any first date -- we do them because it's a necessary investment of time and effort to get to what we really want, a sugar relationship.   While I'm sure there's some tiny minority of guys who are doing this for free dinner purposes, most of what's ascribed to \"he just wanted to be seen with me\" is an SB making up for getting rejected by the SD, and making herself feel better by imagining he was never serious.  He's not saying anything bad that would make him the type of person no SB should be involved with, right?\n\nAnd he's 100% right that even if a pre-agreed to M&G fee weren't ludicrous on its face, it will never become standard, no matter what you say.  This is reality, not being mean.\n\nWhy is he a bad guy for saying any of this?",

I think the biggest issue with the advice is \u201cNever compromise\u201d. Have you ever been in ANY relationship, romantic or otherwise where there was no degree of compromise? Never is a very definitive statement. And it is the same from the SD side. I certainly do not get everything that I want or would like. But I make the decision that it is better for me to compromise in order to stay in the relationship than stick to my guns and accept that it might end. I would love to be in a relationship where I got everything that I wanted and was totally respected at all times. But this is not reality I\u2019m afraid. People (both in a relationship) have moods, outside influences, chemical imbalances, emotions\u2026 \n\nI get it that the experience of a lot of girls right now is bad and that they are coming across a lot of unworthy \u2018SDs\u2019. But equally the SDs are complaining about the culture from their side. If neither of us is willing to compromise I don\u2019t really see how many good SRs there are going to be.",

I\u2019m not saying that there are not vulnerable girls out there who may see this as the only option to get out of some financial difficulty, but that is still a choice.\n\nI think you have hit the nail on the head here to be honest and your post was not in vain. You have inadvertently revealed that there are SBs who consider that they are not doing this by choice, feel bad about it from the start and then to compensate want to be treated \u201cwithout compromise\u201d. But then they are entering into an agreement through a kind of deception. I think you just did the whole pseudo SB community a massive disservice by posting this.

Sugaring is supposed to be different, involving a longer period of time, repeat dates and all being well a connection. Most SB\u2019s want that as much as a decent SD does. Accordingly, it\u2019s not too much to ask that the first M & G involves minimal commitment on each side. Your post puts SB\u2019s squarely in the escort expectations arena. I find it distasteful. And for every one of you who spouts that entitled stuff, there are several others who are happy to agree lunch or coffee and travel expenses with monetary rewards to follow on subsequent dates.

She is saying a lot of the SDs are in the company of women half their age to 20 years younger, these women would not be \"hanging\" out with these men if they were not being paid. \n\nFurthermore, they are \"entertaining you.\" (The smart ones are not going to emotionally dump, complain about life, they're going to come off as easy going, fun, etc). \n\nEspecially if married, attached, where even if she is attracted or likes him it can't lead anywhere.\n\nEven platonic situations, if meeting publicly, you're being seen with an attractive younger woman, etc. What man wouldn't want to be seen with a hot younger woman, she should be paid, sex or not.\n\nIt comes down to her not being there if she wasn't paid.",

It's not allowed, but I could provide pointers to every one of these, easy enough to find though.\n\nThat's why many SBs choose not to participate there -- it's not sugar, it's a payment maximizing manipulation & strategy sub that touches on other topics accidentally.  It's why you're being called out for THAT sub.  It provides a lot of insight into what's going on here.\n\nNot that some of what you wrote isn't totally valid (and other parts, typical \"female strategy\" venting).

Nobody owes you anything for maximizing your own chances. It takes time for me to get groomed, put some nice clothes and cologne on because I'd also like to impress you and you don't owe me anything for it.

When I go on M&Gs, it's because that's what the SB wants -- is she an adult who is capable of making decisions that's right for her, or you know better?  Me personally, I'd rather do dinner.\n\nOn platonic M&Gs, most of us dislike them like we dislike any first date -- we do them because it's a necessary investment of time and effort to get to what we really want, a sugar relationship.   While I'm sure there's some tiny minority of guys who are doing this for free dinner purposes, most of what's ascribed to \"he just wanted to be seen with me\" is an SB making up for getting rejected by the SD, and making herself feel better by imagining he was never serious.  He's not saying anything bad that would make him the type of person no SB should be involved with, right?\n\nAnd he's 100% right that even if a pre-agreed to M&G fee weren't ludicrous on its face, it will never become standard, no matter what you say.  This is reality, not being mean.\n\nWhy is he a bad guy for saying any of this?",

I cannot argue with the individual points in your post, they are valid goals for feeling self empowered and satisfied in the relationship, if (IMO) unrealistic. I think the biggest issue with the advice is \u201cNever compromise\u201d. Have you ever been in ANY relationship, romantic or otherwise where there was no degree of compromise? Never is a very definitive statement. And it is the same from the SD side. I certainly do not get everything that I want or would like. But I make the decision that it is better for me to compromise in order to stay in the relationship than stick to my guns and accept that it might end. I would love to be in a relationship where I got everything that I wanted and was totally respected at all times. But this is not reality I\u2019m afraid. People (both in a relationship) have moods, outside influences, chemical imbalances, emotions\u2026 \n\nI get it that the experience of a lot of girls right now is bad and that they are coming across a lot of unworthy \u2018SDs\u2019. But equally the SDs are complaining about the culture from their side. If neither of us is willing to compromise I don\u2019t really see how many good SRs there are going to be.",

I\u2019m not saying that there are not vulnerable girls out there who may see this as the only option to get out of some financial difficulty, but that is still a choice.\n\nI think you have hit the nail on the head here to be honest and your post was not in vain. You have inadvertently revealed that there are SBs who consider that they are not doing this by choice, feel bad about it from the start and then to compensate want to be treated \u201cwithout compromise\u201d. But then they are entering into an agreement through a kind of deception. I think you just did the whole pseudo SB community a massive disservice by posting this.

If we are talking about workplace equality women never like to discuss that it is still men that do most of the physically demanding labor that ca shorten your life as lower your quality o life, nor is there any discussion to the fact for equality in jobs like construction. \n\nSo you can kindly shove it.

I\u2019m not saying that there are not vulnerable girls out there who may see this as the only option to get out of some financial difficulty, but that is still a choice.\n\nI think you have hit the nail on the head here to be honest and your post was not in vain. You have inadvertently revealed that there are SBs who consider that they are not doing this by choice, feel bad about it from the start and then to compensate want to be treated \u201cwithout compromise\u201d. But then they are entering into an agreement through a kind of deception. I think you just did the whole pseudo SB community a massive disservice by posting this.

                    "body": "Erm, OK. There are a lot of steps between deciding to create a profile on a site known for Sugar Dating and getting in bed with someone. At each of those steps there is a choice to make. If any (so-called) SD is actually forcing a woman to have sex that is known in most countries as a crime and should be reported. I\u2019m not saying that there are not vulnerable girls out there who may see this as the only option to get out of some financial difficulty, but that is still a choice.\n\nI think you have hit the nail on the head here to be honest and your post was not in vain. You have inadvertently revealed that there are SBs who consider that they are not doing this by choice, feel bad about it from the start and then to compensate want to be treated \u201cwithout compromise\u201d. But then they are entering into an agreement through a kind of deception. I think you just did the whole pseudo SB community a massive disservice by posting this. (Of course the real SBs who understand the lifestyle are not included in these comments.)",

I\u2019m not saying that there are not vulnerable girls out there who may see this as the only option to get out of some financial difficulty, but that is still a choice.\n\nI think you have hit the nail on the head here to be honest and your post was not in vain. You have inadvertently revealed that there are SBs who consider that they are not doing this by choice, feel bad about it from the start and then to compensate want to be treated \u201cwithout compromise\u201d. But then they are entering into an agreement through a kind of deception. I think you just did the whole pseudo SB community a massive disservice by posting this.
