    "body": "I\u2019m using a throw away account because obviously there is a stigma with this lifestyle and I don\u2019t feel like explaining myself to anyone In my personal life. \n\nSo I was 20, going to school and shooting part time. I had a good friend who worked with me and always had a lot of nice things. Designer bags, diamonds, shoes you name it she had it. It was really odd to me since she didn\u2019t work a lot. So I asked her about it lol and She ended up telling me about seeking and even invited me to get dinner with her and her SD so I could get a vibe for what it\u2019s like. So I go out with them super nice guy and I realize okay I could do this. \n\nSo I made an account my hopes were to find someone like my friend had who I genuinely connected with, not a piggy bank but someone I could look up to as a mentor and also of course someone who could help me, because I was barely getting by. The first 3 months were rough. I went out with people who seemed to just want a prostitute, people who were just middle class and had no business calling themselves a sugar daddy. (No offense), and worst of all people who were arrogant and pushy. I felt defeated but I stuck with it\n\nOne day I\u2019m on seeking and I see my now husbands profile I messaged him first because I could tell he put a lot of thought into his profile, and I was secretly attracted to him. We clicked instantly he owned six fucking min pins I had/have one as well. They are my favorite breed to me that was the first sign that this was something good. He wasn\u2019t creepy, he genuinely wanted to know me. I felt safe with him. I wasn\u2019t expecting to meet the love of my life on a site like seeking but it happened and I am so thankful. \n\nAnyway my point is don\u2019t settle for SDs that you genuinely don\u2019t find attractive, that you are annoyed by, that are creepy and don\u2019t treat you how you should be treated. Even if it takes time don\u2019t settle because you might surprised by who you meet.",

We all need that special someone...someone who compliments who we are and helps us get closer the the person we want to be.  \n\nThe sugar life is mostly about the fun parts of dating.   Living with someone is mostly about the other, less-fun stuff.  \n\nFelt like all of my past SBs were looking for a vanilla LTR.  I only date women in their 30's, so maybe there is a correlation?  In retrospect, there were a couple who could have gone the distance....\n\nBest wishes.",

SR used to be very much like a vanilla relationship but with sugar. Sort of like what we now call a sugar girlfriend.",
