    "body": "On another post, a pot SD asked if he could be successful in the bowl as a frugal SD. That got me thinking, what are my SBs worth.?\n\nAt the age of 58, I was burned out. My job was consuming me. My marriage, though I had (and still have ) a wonderful wife, was stale. There was no thrill, excitement, or even much joy, since my kids were grown and gone, in my life. Then, by accident, I stumbled into my first SR with a most wonderful, down-to-earth, young lady. My life was changed forever by her.\n\nThat was 16 years ago. From then until now, a series of wonderful women have made me so happy, so fulfilled, so glad to be the man I am.\n\nSo I'll answer my own question: what is an SB worth? To me they are priceless.",

She had a surprising amount of savings to her name, my dad discovered after her passing. It was sad though because she always struggled, and the money she didnt touch would have helped improve her life immensely.  She didn't have a will so why did she save so much? Probably to hide it from my aunt who still lived and mooched off of her her whole life. You can't take your money into the afterlife, so if you're living comfortable and prepared for retirement and emergencies, your happiness is worth more and will bring more joy into you life than the money just sitting in the bank itself ever would.\n\n Spending on people being their lives is always a good cause. Dont give to charities, just help people directly. Doesnt need to be a SB. You could get a houseless person a room for a night. When I become a kajillionaire, I want to help out kids who have always been in poverty and had their dad or something locked up their whole life. They struggled from things that weren't their fault, and I'd want to give them a leg up and provide more opportunity and pay for a community college course or term after thei graduate HS. Even tutoring in HS if they're failing.  Don't end up where your dad has been your whole life, I'll help get you into a better future!!!",

There was a poll some time ago (and probably several since then) that showed SDs tended to allocate closer to 5-10% of their income to sugar. Whether that figure represented a percentage of net income or gross income was a bit iffy. I just assumed it was net, but this is the Internet...",

As someone who was married for 10 myself, I might recommend some advice: look at what you gained during that time, figure out where you can improve in your next relationship, and use whatever support you\u2019re getting from him right now to get yourself back in the worlds as an emotionally healthy, independent woman who men want to chase.\n\nSomething happened in the marriage that resulted in him cheating. He is responsible for his own actions but if you continue to stay stuck in the victim mentality and blame him for everything, then you are virtually giving up all control over your happiness. Even if you truly feel you weren\u2019t at fault, you can set better boundaries for yourself in the future.\n\nNot all men who cheat are cowardly, some are making a calculated decision with regards to what they feel would hurt their sweet wife the least. Would you really have been happier if he left you 10 years ago? If you didn\u2019t have the lifestyle he was providing? If your kids had to suffer through a divorce? Have you considered that he put his own happiness aside to care for the family and then eventually needed another outlet to mentally escape so he could come back happier and more focused?",

Something that is priceless - means you would essentially bankrupt yourself doing it.\n\nThe problem I have with your question is it starts to imply that what an SD provides is the \"worth\" of a person (his SB).  I don't think a person's worth has anything to do with an allowance they receive.\n\nA better question to ask - would be, what is an SR worth ?  The relationship, would be easier to target.\n\nAnd in that - I'd say, it's worth exactly the amount I spend on it each month.  \n\n> From then until now, a series of wonderful women have made me so happy, so fulfilled, so glad to be the man I am.\n\nIs it really - that singular of a factor?  I enjoy sugaring, don't get me wrong.  And I'm \"less happy\" when I'm not sugaring - such as the last 8 months during covid.\n\nBut to ascribe as much value as have here?  I can't even fathom it.",

Probably to hide it from my aunt who still lived and mooched off of her her whole life. You can't take your money into the afterlife, so if you're living comfortable and prepared for retirement and emergencies, your happiness is worth more and will bring more joy into you life than the money just sitting in the bank itself ever would.\n\n Spending on people being their lives is always a good cause.

When I become a kajillionaire, I want to help out kids who have always been in poverty and had their dad or something locked up their whole life. They struggled from things that weren't their fault, and I'd want to give them a leg up and provide more opportunity and pay for a community college course or term after thei graduate HS. Even tutoring in HS if they're failing.  Don't end up where your dad has been your whole life, I'll help get you into a better future!!!",

As someone who was married for 10 myself, I might recommend some advice: look at what you gained during that time, figure out where you can improve in your next relationship, and use whatever support you\u2019re getting from him right now to get yourself back in the worlds as an emotionally healthy, independent woman who men want to chase.\n\nSomething happened in the marriage that resulted in him cheating. He is responsible for his own actions but if you continue to stay stuck in the victim mentality and blame him for everything, then you are virtually giving up all control over your happiness. Even if you truly feel you weren\u2019t at fault, you can set better boundaries for yourself in the future.\n\nNot all men who cheat are cowardly, some are making a calculated decision with regards to what they feel would hurt their sweet wife the least. Would you really have been happier if he left you 10 years ago? If you didn\u2019t have the lifestyle he was providing? If your kids had to suffer through a divorce? Have you considered that he put his own happiness aside to care for the family and then eventually needed another outlet to mentally escape so he could come back happier and more focused?",

She had a surprising amount of savings to her name, my dad discovered after her passing. It was sad though because she always struggled, and the money she didnt touch would have helped improve her life immensely.  She didn't have a will so why did she save so much? Probably to hide it from my aunt who still lived and mooched off of her her whole life. You can't take your money into the afterlife, so if you're living comfortable and prepared for retirement and emergencies, your happiness is worth more and will bring more joy into you life than the money just sitting in the bank itself ever would.\n\n Spending on people being their lives is always a good cause. Dont give to charities, just help people directly. Doesnt need to be a SB. You could get a houseless person a room for a night. When I become a kajillionaire, I want to help out kids who have always been in poverty and had their dad or something locked up their whole life. They struggled from things that weren't their fault, and I'd want to give them a leg up and provide more opportunity and pay for a community college course or term after thei graduate HS. Even tutoring in HS if they're failing.  Don't end up where your dad has been your whole life, I'll help get you into a better future!!!",

She had a surprising amount of savings to her name, my dad discovered after her passing. It was sad though because she always struggled, and the money she didnt touch would have helped improve her life immensely.  She didn't have a will so why did she save so much? Probably to hide it from my aunt who still lived and mooched off of her her whole life. You can't take your money into the afterlife, so if you're living comfortable and prepared for retirement and emergencies, your happiness is worth more and will bring more joy into you life than the money just sitting in the bank itself ever would.\n\n Spending on people being their lives is always a good cause. Dont give to charities, just help people directly. Doesnt need to be a SB. You could get a houseless person a room for a night. When I become a kajillionaire, I want to help out kids who have always been in poverty and had their dad or something locked up their whole life. They struggled from things that weren't their fault, and I'd want to give them a leg up and provide more opportunity and pay for a community college course or term after thei graduate HS. Even tutoring in HS if they're failing.  Don't end up where your dad has been your whole life, I'll help get you into a better future!!!",

One meet and greet with a fair gift and then she knows if she likes you or not.  It doesn\u2019t take multiple paid dates for them to decide,   They know in the first 5 minutes of the first meeting.  \n\nI also laugh at any SB talking about someone with a low 8 figure net worth as Splenda.   GTFO with that BS.   A very 8 figure net worth puts you in the top 1%.  At a conservative 4% draw down you can spend thirty three thousand a month without earning a penny and break even.   You have some girl living in an apartment with no bed frame calling that Splenda... that\u2019s silly.",

She had a surprising amount of savings to her name, my dad discovered after her passing. It was sad though because she always struggled, and the money she didnt touch would have helped improve her life immensely.  She didn't have a will so why did she save so much? Probably to hide it from my aunt who still lived and mooched off of her her whole life. You can't take your money into the afterlife, so if you're living comfortable and prepared for retirement and emergencies, your happiness is worth more and will bring more joy into you life than the money just sitting in the bank itself ever would.\n\n Spending on people being their lives is always a good cause. Dont give to charities, just help people directly. Doesnt need to be a SB. You could get a houseless person a room for a night. When I become a kajillionaire, I want to help out kids who have always been in poverty and had their dad or something locked up their whole life. They struggled from things that weren't their fault, and I'd want to give them a leg up and provide more opportunity and pay for a community college course or term after thei graduate HS. Even tutoring in HS if they're failing.  Don't end up where your dad has been your whole life, I'll help get you into a better future!!!",

There\u2019s a point as a SB we also need to think of if having this nice guy in a relationship worth barely breaking even between travel, self care to hold physical expectations, loss of potential income and otherwise. Splenda in way I see it used in SB groups I am in is often used in reference to guys just above salt or Splendas that I appreciate reading about, that understand they\u2019re paying below market but not expecting above market $$(ie online only platonic text etc).",

There is a lot of value in having a wealthy guy in your back pocket for when life\u2019s emergencies arise.   Most of us end up doing things down the road that we never would have agreed to up front but we care for them and see a legitimate need.",
