    "body": "I started building out my investment portfolio in my 30s, and always wished if someone had shown me the power of investing & compounding in my 20s.\n\nTwo years ago when I met my SGF, she did not have a 401k, savings, or investments.\n\nShe did not know much about investing, compound returns, or stocks.\n\nI mentored her and showed her the power of compounding returns, how you can become a millionaire even with small contributions.\n\nI asked her to open a Roth IRA and recommended her to contribute a couple of hundred dollars every month to it. As an incentive, I offered her a 100% match to double her contributions (kind of like an employer 401k) match.\n\nOver the last two years, she has been depositing 250/month to it and I top it with another 250 to max the 6,000/yr limit. All of it is invested into ARKK ETF.\n\nThis month, her account hit 25k total in just 2 years, this is way more than what she had in her savings. If she continues to do this, just 500/month can turn into a million dollars in 10 to 30 years (depending on how the market goes), all of it tax-free!\n\nShe is thrilled and plans to double down on investing.\n\nSBs, do you invest in 401k, IRA, or any other investments?",

Apparently when he died he was worth in the neighborhood of a hundred million dollars and was generating close to one million a MONTH in rental income, dividends & interest. \n\nThe guy had a dozen grand kids and several great grand kids.

Understand your investment window.   Any investment needs to be aimed at a > 5year horizon ideally.  If you are going to need the money to pay for collage next year short term volatility makes this very high risk. \n\n2. Watch the fees.  Fees kill compounded returns like you could never imagine.\n\n3.  Understand the value of your investment will go down as well as up .... if you are following point 1 don\u2019t sweat it.  It\u2019s all about time in the market not timing the market.\n\n4.  Most unsophisticated investors will struggle to do better than a low fee globally (try to avoid over exposure to any one market including the US ... QE won\u2019t last forever you know)  and sector diversified etf or tracker fund.\n\n5 Put a regular amount in each month and forget it.  Check your portfolio once a quarter not 5 times a day.\n\n6 Educate yourself... there\u2019s lots of material out there.    You could do worse than read The Simple Path to Wealth by JL Collins.",

It's well worth the 0.75% expense ratio.\n\nIt's slightly riskier than SPY/VOO. I might not invest a lot in it if I was a retiree, but as a younger investor, I am very bullish on ARKK for the next 5-10 years to capture the growth.",

Biggish residential real estate guy.  \n\nHe owned over 50 homes outright that he rented out.  \n\nHe\u2019d then invest the rental income he didn\u2019t spend into dividend yielding stocks, tax free bonds and treasuries.  \n\nThe guy was your quintessential millionaire next door.  \n\nAt his funeral some of us sat around and drank  and talked about his philosophy.  Apparently when he died he was worth in the neighborhood of a hundred million dollars and was generating close to one million a MONTH in rental income, dividends & interest. \n\nThe guy had a dozen grand kids and several great grand kids.  Every one of them (and their children\u2019s children) were taken care of. \n\nI\u2019ve adopted his investment philosophy.  I too have a residential real estate business and invest in the same diversified way.   \n\nI do have growth in my portfolio.  But no way am I ever going to invest 100% of my money in some non income bearing \u201cgrowth\u201d fund like ARKK.",
