    "body": "I was using SA and found a man who called men who are SD \u201cold lonely men who can\u2019t find a girlfriend, so they pay women to like them\u201d. \n\nHe then said \u201cwomen love believing they aren\u2019t esc0rts because the money they receive is for tuition or because the payment is monthly\ud83d\ude02\u201d\n\u201cWomen pretend that their SD is their casual boyfriend who spoils them when they\u2019re just using an old man for money, so no I will not be giving you gifts nor money. I just need a submissive woman who enjoys fine dining and is fun to be with\u201d\n\nRude, misogynistic and arrogant. There\u2019s Tindr for a reason why come on SA to put down fellow SD and SB? Sounds like a narcissist who came here to trigger people(it did work). He\u2019s a diamond user btw and his description is \u201cnot your regular SD\u201d",

Also, I am an SB but I have no issue saying I have sex for money because I do know without that neither one of us would be there. I\u2019m not calling you anything just saying none of what he said would bother me he sounds like a complete loser. Just feel sorry for these people they obviously have no life at all to spend money and time doing that.",

Why on earth would a SD, on a site where the ratio is so much in his favour with 4 SBs for every SD, need to become a 'Diamond member?\n2. Why would a seriously wealthy man paint a red sign on his forehead and attract all kinds of unwanted attention, whereas usually very wealthy people prefer to stay under the radar just to avoid this kind of attention they encounter everyday in  daily life?\n3. What's investing $250 for a scammers syndicate that operates 24/7 with a team of 'operators' from Nigeria, to get in contact with a lot of naive and money hungry girls to scam? That's an easy ROI!\n\nIf a SD needs to become a Diamond member somethings off, and usually it's one of the answers on the above questions.",

I don't expect you to understand that, but please try.\n\nWhat you probably mean when you say SB, I'm guessing, is that you prefer a GFE SB and you recognize one based on how she makes you feel. That's fine. But that does not mean someone who does not do what you like, make you feel how you like to feel, does not belong in the bowl or isn't a good SB. Despite your sense of entitlement.\n\nAs for what I am - I'm no one to you because I don't give you the feeling you want and that you feel your deserve. And I guess I don't belong in the bowl either because I believe it can be whatever people want it to be, from platonic to just hook ups, so long as everyone plays nice and is as honest as they can be about what they seek. And you, my friend do not belong in my bowl, because with your judgments you are not playing nice.\n\nHere's hoping some of this sinks in.",

It's noticeably more toxic than it was ten years ago, and unfortunately you saw an example of that.\n\nSo as always when dealing with narcs: do not engage, and do not feed their trolling and manipulation. You've got to have that keyboard trigger-finger ready, and block those toxic people as quickly as possible. The toxicity comes from all directions these days:  SA, Facebook, reddit (including this forum), Twitter, etc. \n\nAnd dealing with narcs on a consistent basis is not good for mental health (I learned this over the last few years, as I made great improvements in my own mental health). So in the interest of self-protection, you almost have to assume that everyone is a toxic narc, and only change that assumption after they have proven otherwise.",

Does that work for you, or is your opinion a fact and mine just an argumentative opinion?\n\nI am not going to get into an argument with you about what the difference is between an escort and a SB, because as I said at the start, you and I do not have the right to decide that.\n\nHow would you describe what you consider a SB if not someone who acts like she is your GF? And why is it okay for you to call SBs who don't do that for you escorts, but it's objectionable for me to call the kind of SB you, and I, prefer GFE?\n\nMy point here isn't complicated - you should not call people whose approach to sugar you don't like derogatory names and try to marginalize them. Just stop, please. Their approach is as valid as yours and if they consider it sugar, it's sugar. You don't get to decide what is and is not sugar, which are good girls and bad girls.

I was swept off my feet through conversation & the stimulation + the giving... my love language is gifting - big, small tokens that show appreciation... he always one ups things. He always gives me plenty of space and he gets rather happy when I of my free decision do things for him.. baking, wearing something ik he's seen on his TV crush lol - etc \u263a\n\nThe only \"off\" is hes terminal, unknown of whether hes got a year, months, few years.

I don't expect you to understand that, but please try.\n\nWhat you probably mean when you say SB, I'm guessing, is that you prefer a GFE SB and you recognize one based on how she makes you feel. That's fine. But that does not mean someone who does not do what you like, make you feel how you like to feel, does not belong in the bowl or isn't a good SB. Despite your sense of entitlement.\n\nAs for what I am - I'm no one to you because I don't give you the feeling you want and that you feel your deserve. And I guess I don't belong in the bowl either because I believe it can be whatever people want it to be, from platonic to just hook ups, so long as everyone plays nice and is as honest as they can be about what they seek. And you, my friend do not belong in my bowl, because with your judgments you are not playing nice.\n\nHere's hoping some of this sinks in.",

What's investing $250 for a scammers syndicate that operates 24/7 with a team of 'operators' from Nigeria, to get in contact with a lot of naive and money hungry girls to scam? That's an easy ROI!\n\nIf a SD needs to become a Diamond member somethings off, and usually it's one of the answers on the above questions.",

I received fewer scam messages, too.

You should stop doing that because it's wrong, and because it perpetuates a male view of women as good or bad based on male judgment of them. I don't expect you to understand that, but please try.\n\nWhat you probably mean when you say SB, I'm guessing, is that you prefer a GFE SB and you recognize one based on how she makes you feel. That's fine. But that does not mean someone who does not do what you like, make you feel how you like to feel, does not belong in the bowl or isn't a good SB. Despite your sense of entitlement.\n\nAs for what I am - I'm no one to you because I don't give you the feeling you want and that you feel your deserve. And I guess I don't belong in the bowl either because I believe it can be whatever people want it to be, from platonic to just hook ups, so long as everyone plays nice and is as honest as they can be about what they seek. And you, my friend do not belong in my bowl, because with your judgments you are not playing nice.\n\nHere's hoping some of this sinks in.",

I don't expect you to understand that, but please try.\n\nWhat you probably mean when you say SB, I'm guessing, is that you prefer a GFE SB and you recognize one based on how she makes you feel. That's fine. But that does not mean someone who does not do what you like, make you feel how you like to feel, does not belong in the bowl or isn't a good SB. Despite your sense of entitlement.\n\nAs for what I am - I'm no one to you because I don't give you the feeling you want and that you feel your deserve. And I guess I don't belong in the bowl either because I believe it can be whatever people want it to be, from platonic to just hook ups, so long as everyone plays nice and is as honest as they can be about what they seek.
