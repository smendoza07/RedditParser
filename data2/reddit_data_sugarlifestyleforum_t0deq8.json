    "body": "I had my wallet stolen from a hotel room by a sb a few months ago.\n\nLuckily  I still had my phone and I make a habit of exchanging driver's licenses with my pot when we start an arrangment so I had a photo of the pot's driver's license on my phone.\n\nI called the police and an officer came to the hotel. After I told him my story he asked to see the photo of the license. Then he got on the phone and left her the following message:\n\n*\"Hello Ma'am this is officer Smith and I have had a report of the theft of a wallet from the a gentleman here at the Doubletree Hotel and I have reason to believe you may have some knowledge about that theft. I need you to call me back at this number right away or I will have to issue  a warrant for your arrest. I can have the campus police there at your door in five minutes and you might have to spend the night in jail so please call me back at your earliest convenience.\"*\n\nThe sb called him back a few minutes later. I don't know what he said to her but he must have scared her good because she admitted that she had the wallet. He told her to take the wallet to the campus police at her university and drop it off. An hour later I had my wallet back. Nothing missing.\n\nI was lucky but I was also careful.  I never have a pot at a hotel or at my home unless I know who she is and that means having seen  her driver's license and taken a photo of it.  I usually do this at the M&G and before we have an intimate date I always run a background check to see if they have any arrests on their record.\n\nJust a Word to the Wise",

Uh oh it's gone.\n\nI rush to my door and open it completely naked and see her walking away. She responds that she does not have it. I tell her if she does not come back to talk to me I will call hotel security. She starts walking back and flips my wallet towards another door. I tell her I saw that and pick it up and return it. She finally does and no harm no foul but I had a very hungover flight to make a few hours later and dodged a bullet on that one.",

If longer than that, I'm definitely shocked.\n\nI have to admit that during that getting to know you phase, I hide my wallet.  And take it with me into the bathroom when I shower afterwards.  I've always thought of this as protecting her as much as me.  For me, it's not just the money, I'm not risking anyone I don't know well having access to all the juicy info in my wallet.  For her, in the distant past I've had situations where I thought I had (say) $300 in my wallet, and after the date I had $200.  Did she steal it?  Well come to think of it I may have only had $200.  Or was it $300.  Oh no I definitely gave my kid $100 so I only had $200.  Didn't I?\n\nAt no point does any SB who I don't know well have access to my wallet or phone in a room alone (or they might and not know it, because even if they looked for my wallet in my pants, they wouldn't find it)",
