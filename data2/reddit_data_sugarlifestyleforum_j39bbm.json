    "body": "So yesterday my SD (49) and I (26) had such a wonderful afternoon\ud83e\udd70\n\nWe had at least a half an hour before we were able to check into the hotel. So we ended up meeting at a beach spot only a few minutes away... As soon as he saw me he just could not let go of me! As he was holding and rocking me he was telling me how proud he is of me, and how hard-working he thinks that I am ... It was so nice to hear especially during these tough times when I am barely working yet trying to do all I can to stay busy and active.\n\nWe checked in, and on our way up in the elevator, he was telling me how he wants to make me feel comfortable and that \"anything my princess wants, she gets\" \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\n\nWe cuddled and kissed for a bit and then he gave me a present \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70 my PPM, gas money and some ADORABLE dragonfly earrings.. Dragonflies are our spirit animal (long silly story) so it just meant the world to me... \n\nThe sex was unlike anything I have ever had. He is so attentive, caring and sexy. I got to try new things because of him and vise versa. He put my toes in his mouth and sucked on them while penetrating me and it felt SO GOOD \ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29.\n\nThere was tons of cuddling and compliments in between rounds and at the end we had a shower together.. He literally washed my whole body head to toe & shampooed/conditioned my hair \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d. I felt so special!!\n\nLater when I was home alone getting ready for bed he messaged me telling me he had such a wonderful time and how he loved the way I sucked his cock and how he's never been given a bj like that before \ud83e\udd70. He said he was going to sleep well because he was going to bed happy & satisfied. \n\nSame here daddy \ud83d\ude18\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97\n\nI feel so grateful. I have never had a man treat me so well before... So thankful that I found this sub, did my research, and found what I wanted.\n\nThanks for all the help guys \ud83e\udd17\n\nEdit: grammar",
