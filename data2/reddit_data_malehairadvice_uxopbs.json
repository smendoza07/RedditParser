You really are a very good looking guy with great bone structure and hair I would consider trading the life of my first born child for (that\u2019s a joke incase anyone honestly thinks I\u2019d trade my now adult child for hair when everyone knows the going rate is luxurious hair plus 2 packets of nice & spicy Nik Naks \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude02). Even though I have numerous female friends with similar hair type and have the never ending battle of threading, I\u2019d still love to have this hair type \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude02. Sorry, back to you OP - you can rock any of these styles but (from top left to bottom right) 1, 5 and 6 seem to jump off the screen more - I think they frame your features more/better. I always find it interesting how different we can look in pictures with only slight changes - posture etc.",

You also have a ton of volume at your roots. You'll have to play around with what's feasible and suits you, but you can mask some of that thinning if you're willing to give up some of that volume to direct your hair over the spots you're the most concerned about.\n\nBest of luck but also if you decide long hair just isn't working for you, congrats on looking fantastic with short hair. Bottom middle gives me bearded Rahul-Kohli-with-a-taper vibes and bottom right is badass.",
