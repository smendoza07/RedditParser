Don\u2019t put up pics that hide your body type. Just be honest...every guy has their preference and you can likely still find someone. \n\nBeing deceptive, or lying about what you look like though is close to an automatic next.",

Know how there are outliers even in this community certain places where allowances are super high well think of Manhattan Clubs as the outlier. They are absolutely not like any clubs in other cities. It\u2019s apples and oranges to the rest of the country. No one tips stage or even cares about it....not much of a lap dance scene except for maybe a fri/sat. The places I worked most the clientele were hedge fund managers, celebrities and athletes who really don\u2019t do anything in public. \n\nWhen I first moved here I thought it would be like it was back home OH GAWD nope guys just said let\u2019s go to the back and that\u2019s where we drank, danced and partied. Totally bananas. So it gets frustrating when people compare it to other parts of the country but hell I didn\u2019t know what bottle service was til I moved here and def hadn\u2019t even seen coke! \n\nIt just is what it is and back rooms were more of a discretion thing. Sting was a regular at the club hahaha amongst most of the Manhattan Forbes list guys. Also, dancers here know the importance of discretion and would never rat on a big fish. So the Uber wealthy feel way more comfortable and also the host guard their identities. Those guys aren\u2019t on SA and def wouldn\u2019t open themselves up to blackmail (the smart ones).\n\nI had a customer spend $250k in 6 weeks coming to see me. That wasn\u2019t including the ridiculous tips he dropped. I moved to the marketing and promoting side and the nightly spend of one customer would be 5 to 12k low end. \n\nI hated the lifestyle though and wouldn\u2019t go back. Much happier in sugar world.",

Or, a mix of younger and older looking ones - if you don't look like the younger you with dark hair in your business suit anymore, then please don't include it. One POT SD I connected with had 10 photos of himself looking very much like a male model with an incredibly sculpted body and abs...except I noticed there was one single photo of him covered in a plaid shirt where his body looked noticeably much larger (like a good 100lbs larger). When we chatted, without me asking, he himself made the comment that he was 'fatter' these days. If that's the case, then why put all the inaccurate pictures up when he doesn't look like that anymore? 'Truth in advertising' applies to both sides.",

Know how there are outliers even in this community certain places where allowances are super high well think of Manhattan Clubs as the outlier. They are absolutely not like any clubs in other cities. It\u2019s apples and oranges to the rest of the country. No one tips stage or even cares about it....not much of a lap dance scene except for maybe a fri/sat. The places I worked most the clientele were hedge fund managers, celebrities and athletes who really don\u2019t do anything in public. \n\nWhen I first moved here I thought it would be like it was back home OH GAWD nope guys just said let\u2019s go to the back and that\u2019s where we drank, danced and partied. Totally bananas. So it gets frustrating when people compare it to other parts of the country but hell I didn\u2019t know what bottle service was til I moved here and def hadn\u2019t even seen coke! \n\nIt just is what it is and back rooms were more of a discretion thing. Sting was a regular at the club hahaha amongst most of the Manhattan Forbes list guys. Also, dancers here know the importance of discretion and would never rat on a big fish. So the Uber wealthy feel way more comfortable and also the host guard their identities. Those guys aren\u2019t on SA and def wouldn\u2019t open themselves up to blackmail (the smart ones).\n\nI had a customer spend $250k in 6 weeks coming to see me. That wasn\u2019t including the ridiculous tips he dropped. I moved to the marketing and promoting side and the nightly spend of one customer would be 5 to 12k low end. \n\nI hated the lifestyle though and wouldn\u2019t go back. Much happier in sugar world.",

I'd rather shop for it together -- online or in store -- so don't  need sizes, but not everyone operates that way.  No reason to turn would could be a gift into a negative.",

Know how there are outliers even in this community certain places where allowances are super high well think of Manhattan Clubs as the outlier. They are absolutely not like any clubs in other cities. It\u2019s apples and oranges to the rest of the country. No one tips stage or even cares about it....not much of a lap dance scene except for maybe a fri/sat. The places I worked most the clientele were hedge fund managers, celebrities and athletes who really don\u2019t do anything in public. \n\nWhen I first moved here I thought it would be like it was back home OH GAWD nope guys just said let\u2019s go to the back and that\u2019s where we drank, danced and partied. Totally bananas. So it gets frustrating when people compare it to other parts of the country but hell I didn\u2019t know what bottle service was til I moved here and def hadn\u2019t even seen coke! \n\nIt just is what it is and back rooms were more of a discretion thing. Sting was a regular at the club hahaha amongst most of the Manhattan Forbes list guys. Also, dancers here know the importance of discretion and would never rat on a big fish. So the Uber wealthy feel way more comfortable and also the host guard their identities. Those guys aren\u2019t on SA and def wouldn\u2019t open themselves up to blackmail (the smart ones).\n\nI had a customer spend $250k in 6 weeks coming to see me. That wasn\u2019t including the ridiculous tips he dropped. I moved to the marketing and promoting side and the nightly spend of one customer would be 5 to 12k low end. \n\nI hated the lifestyle though and wouldn\u2019t go back. Much happier in sugar world.",

Know how there are outliers even in this community certain places where allowances are super high well think of Manhattan Clubs as the outlier. They are absolutely not like any clubs in other cities. It\u2019s apples and oranges to the rest of the country. No one tips stage or even cares about it....not much of a lap dance scene except for maybe a fri/sat. The places I worked most the clientele were hedge fund managers, celebrities and athletes who really don\u2019t do anything in public. \n\nWhen I first moved here I thought it would be like it was back home OH GAWD nope guys just said let\u2019s go to the back and that\u2019s where we drank, danced and partied. Totally bananas. So it gets frustrating when people compare it to other parts of the country but hell I didn\u2019t know what bottle service was til I moved here and def hadn\u2019t even seen coke! \n\nIt just is what it is and back rooms were more of a discretion thing. Sting was a regular at the club hahaha amongst most of the Manhattan Forbes list guys. Also, dancers here know the importance of discretion and would never rat on a big fish. So the Uber wealthy feel way more comfortable and also the host guard their identities. Those guys aren\u2019t on SA and def wouldn\u2019t open themselves up to blackmail (the smart ones).\n\nI had a customer spend $250k in 6 weeks coming to see me. That wasn\u2019t including the ridiculous tips he dropped. I moved to the marketing and promoting side and the nightly spend of one customer would be 5 to 12k low end. \n\nI hated the lifestyle though and wouldn\u2019t go back. Much happier in sugar world.",

Know how there are outliers even in this community certain places where allowances are super high well think of Manhattan Clubs as the outlier. They are absolutely not like any clubs in other cities. It\u2019s apples and oranges to the rest of the country. No one tips stage or even cares about it....not much of a lap dance scene except for maybe a fri/sat. The places I worked most the clientele were hedge fund managers, celebrities and athletes who really don\u2019t do anything in public. \n\nWhen I first moved here I thought it would be like it was back home OH GAWD nope guys just said let\u2019s go to the back and that\u2019s where we drank, danced and partied. Totally bananas. So it gets frustrating when people compare it to other parts of the country but hell I didn\u2019t know what bottle service was til I moved here and def hadn\u2019t even seen coke! \n\nIt just is what it is and back rooms were more of a discretion thing. Sting was a regular at the club hahaha amongst most of the Manhattan Forbes list guys. Also, dancers here know the importance of discretion and would never rat on a big fish. So the Uber wealthy feel way more comfortable and also the host guard their identities. Those guys aren\u2019t on SA and def wouldn\u2019t open themselves up to blackmail (the smart ones).\n\nI had a customer spend $250k in 6 weeks coming to see me. That wasn\u2019t including the ridiculous tips he dropped. I moved to the marketing and promoting side and the nightly spend of one customer would be 5 to 12k low end. \n\nI hated the lifestyle though and wouldn\u2019t go back. Much happier in sugar world.",

Know how there are outliers even in this community certain places where allowances are super high well think of Manhattan Clubs as the outlier. They are absolutely not like any clubs in other cities. It\u2019s apples and oranges to the rest of the country. No one tips stage or even cares about it....not much of a lap dance scene except for maybe a fri/sat. The places I worked most the clientele were hedge fund managers, celebrities and athletes who really don\u2019t do anything in public. \n\nWhen I first moved here I thought it would be like it was back home OH GAWD nope guys just said let\u2019s go to the back and that\u2019s where we drank, danced and partied. Totally bananas. So it gets frustrating when people compare it to other parts of the country but hell I didn\u2019t know what bottle service was til I moved here and def hadn\u2019t even seen coke! \n\nIt just is what it is and back rooms were more of a discretion thing. Sting was a regular at the club hahaha amongst most of the Manhattan Forbes list guys. Also, dancers here know the importance of discretion and would never rat on a big fish. So the Uber wealthy feel way more comfortable and also the host guard their identities. Those guys aren\u2019t on SA and def wouldn\u2019t open themselves up to blackmail (the smart ones).\n\nI had a customer spend $250k in 6 weeks coming to see me. That wasn\u2019t including the ridiculous tips he dropped. I moved to the marketing and promoting side and the nightly spend of one customer would be 5 to 12k low end. \n\nI hated the lifestyle though and wouldn\u2019t go back. Much happier in sugar world.",

Know how there are outliers even in this community certain places where allowances are super high well think of Manhattan Clubs as the outlier. They are absolutely not like any clubs in other cities. It\u2019s apples and oranges to the rest of the country. No one tips stage or even cares about it....not much of a lap dance scene except for maybe a fri/sat. The places I worked most the clientele were hedge fund managers, celebrities and athletes who really don\u2019t do anything in public. \n\nWhen I first moved here I thought it would be like it was back home OH GAWD nope guys just said let\u2019s go to the back and that\u2019s where we drank, danced and partied. Totally bananas. So it gets frustrating when people compare it to other parts of the country but hell I didn\u2019t know what bottle service was til I moved here and def hadn\u2019t even seen coke! \n\nIt just is what it is and back rooms were more of a discretion thing. Sting was a regular at the club hahaha amongst most of the Manhattan Forbes list guys. Also, dancers here know the importance of discretion and would never rat on a big fish. So the Uber wealthy feel way more comfortable and also the host guard their identities. Those guys aren\u2019t on SA and def wouldn\u2019t open themselves up to blackmail (the smart ones).\n\nI had a customer spend $250k in 6 weeks coming to see me. That wasn\u2019t including the ridiculous tips he dropped. I moved to the marketing and promoting side and the nightly spend of one customer would be 5 to 12k low end. \n\nI hated the lifestyle though and wouldn\u2019t go back. Much happier in sugar world.",

Those guys aren\u2019t on SA and def wouldn\u2019t open themselves up to blackmail (the smart ones).\n\nI had a customer spend $250k in 6 weeks coming to see me. That wasn\u2019t including the ridiculous tips he dropped. I moved to the marketing and promoting side and the nightly spend of one customer would be 5 to 12k low end. \n\nI hated the lifestyle though and wouldn\u2019t go back. Much happier in sugar world.",
