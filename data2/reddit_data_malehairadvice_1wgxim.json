I'd tie it up in a bun and just sort of forget about it.\n\nAfter letting it grow for years and years (I believe last I got it cut was mid-2008). Other than then my hair had always been long-ish, the longest before mid-2008 was about shoulder length.\n\nI wasn't letting it grow for any particular reason, I didn't mind the length, especially when my grey streak started becoming more prominent. Started tying it in a ponytail, when that ended up getting too long and windswept/tangled I opted for putting it in a bun.\n\nAt this stage my hair was pretty damaged and broken, I never bothered getting it cut regularly, it'd all just eventually break and hadn't changed in length much for about a year, if not more.\n\nSo the night before last I just decided that I wanted to change it. but still keep the grey streak, so I settled on keeping the bangs at the front, and from facing turns out to look pretty remarkably similar to how it did when it was tied up.\n\nAll in all I'm super pleased with how it turned out! Especially after putting it off for all these years.",

It can give rise to a \"Mallen Streak\" that can be hereditary.

People with [Waardenburg syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waardenburg_syndrome) usually present this symptom, as do 60% of patients with [tuberous sclerosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberous_sclerosis).\n\n>This condition can cause white patches (singular or multiple - usually single) on the hair.

It can give rise to a \"Mallen Streak\" that can be hereditary. [Catherine Cookson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Cookson) wrote a novel and later a TV series called The Mallen Streak, where a family had the condition. Sports presenter [Dickie Davies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dickie_Davies) and runner Sam Brown were famous for this feature. People with [Waardenburg syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waardenburg_syndrome) usually present this symptom, as do 60% of patients with [tuberous sclerosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberous_sclerosis).\n\n>This condition can cause white patches (singular or multiple - usually single) on the hair. Most people confuse these white patches as simple birth marks.\n\n\n>====\n\n>[**Image**](http://i.imgur.com/yHBJzDj.jpg) [^(i)](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vitiligo_and_Poliosis.jpg)\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Vogt\u2013Koyanagi\u2013Harada ^syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogt%E2%80%93Koyanagi%E2%80%93Harada_syndrome) ^| [^Dickie ^Davies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dickie_Davies) ^| [^Alezzandrini ^syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alezzandrini_syndrome) ^| [^Waardenburg ^syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waardenburg_syndrome) \n\n*^\\/u/Wofiel ^can ^reply ^with ^'delete'. ^Will ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less.* ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/) ^| [^flag ^a ^glitch](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/autowikibot&subject=Glitched comment report&message=Here's what's wrong: <description \\(optional\\)>%0A%0A---%0A%0AReply no. 35750:%0Ahttp://www.reddit.com/r/malehairadvice/comments/1wgxim/so_i_went_for_a_pretty_big_change_yesterday/cf252ko)",

Always wondered what caused it, just appeared when I was 18 and has progressively got bigger, its around the same size as your's and I have a very similar hair cut. (I'm also 22) Your streak is a bit more pronounced as mine, but do you constantly get people asking \"do you dye that in?...\" and when they ask its usually in a kinda of annoyed tone. As if to say \"why the fuck would you do that to your hair you idiot\". I've even had people at clubs stop in front of me, stair at my hair and then give me a dirty look. Maybe Australia is just full of assholes who knows.",
