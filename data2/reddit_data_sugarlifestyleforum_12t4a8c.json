    "body": "After a self-professed incel decided to go on a journey today of calling me a believer in \u201cpedo science\u201d for thinking that older men have a responsibility to be cautious with 18 year old women (no, I don\u2019t get it either)-- I thought about what advice I would give my 18 year old self if I was starting to sugar now.\n\n\\---\n\n**Hi friend,**\n\n**I was you twelve years ago**. I was 18 and a virgin when I joined the bowl. I lost my virginity to my first SD after we were together 6 months. I wouldn\u2019t change that experience at all.\n\nAnd I also wouldn\u2019t do it again now. \n\nI found SA after a series of googles about age gap relationships and sugar daddy dating. \n\nSA was a totally different beast in 2010. It was not as widely known or advertised. It seemed like a club of like-minded folks who wanted the best for each other and wanted to indulge in a mutually beneficial age-gap relationship.\n\nBack then, we didn\u2019t have reddit, we chatted on the SA blog instead. (A lot of the same folks migrated to reddit after then\u2014hi old friends.)\n\nConversations didn\u2019t start explicit. There were no talks of PPM. When you showed up to a M&G, there was never an expectation of sex and a gift was always given. \n\n**It was a different time.** \n\nI know what it feels like to feel underestimated, to feel mature for my age, to feel disrespected when others assume I don\u2019t know things or that I can\u2019t handle myself. \n\nAnd I also know that we learn as we get older than we are often not as well-equipped as our confidence would suggest.\n\n**So here is my advice to you if you decide to enter the bowl as a young woman:**\n\n**Know yourself first**\n\nIf you don\u2019t take the time to understand your boundaries or your desires, you won\u2019t be able to articulate them. If you don\u2019t feel confident in your ability to articulate them, please reconsider your entrance into the bowl. \n\n**Know how to say \u201cno\u201d**\n\nYou need to be able to not only say \u201cno\u201d, but to also back up that \u201cno\u201d with concrete actions. Your boundaries matter. They are not up for debate. If a man tries to convince you they are, you need to be able to cut that man out of your life. \n\n**Know someone in your corner**\n\nI think this one is imperative. It can be someone from reddit or someone from your real life, but you need a trusted confidant who can be an outside observer. An objective perspective is important for everyone, but especially so for someone with limited experience. \n\n**Know that now is not forever**\n\nIf you decide that you don\u2019t want to enter the bowl now, that\u2019s ok. It doesn\u2019t mean there is something wrong with you (or right with you) or that you won\u2019t have the opportunity down the line. There is a long long long life ahead of you. Your life path will hardly end where you envisioned it might. Give yourself the space to grow and change over time. \n\nThank you, young SB, for reading this message. I am forever and always in your corner, hoping for your success in sugar and in life. My DMs are always open for you.",

            "body": "As someone who has had an account on SA for many years, my advice to an 18 year old virgin would be much simpler: **Just don't do it.**  \n\nAs the OP rightly said, SA is a very different place now, filled largely with younger girls looking for fast money and older guys looking for fast sex.  I really can't think of a less appropriate place for a very young woman who hasn't even experienced intimacy with a regular BF.\n\nMaybe go live a little first.  Get a job or even two - you're young.  Date.  Fall in love.  Invest in yourself by improving your skills, which will ultimately lead to better income. Start to live a life and learn more about people and the world before wading into a pull of older, horny and sometimes predatory men.",

What jumped out was that she found an SD who was willing to wait for months. I'm pretty sure that it took a lot of patience (or luck) to find the right SD.  That's one of the foundational challenges, sort of like looking for a gold nugget in a garbage pail. \n\nTwo thoughts I would add is \n\na)  Try to think ahead 10-15 years,  how will you look back on the arrangement.   The right one is likely to be far more beneficial to her growth than a short adventure after a night of drinking with some of her peers or those a few years older. \n\nb) The second is to be both patient with the development of your comfort with the arrangement, cautious and willing to call it off at any point.......",

I'm not an overly opinionated person but this post is troubling:\n\nPoint by point:\n\n\\- An 18 year old can't really know themself. Frontal cortex development is still several years away. So no matter how mature they think they are, they are not.\n\n\\- An 18 year old virgin does not possess anywhere near the tools required to say no and mean it. \n\n\\- Who is an 18 year old, a virgin no less, going to find to be in their corner? An 18 year old friend? That's a terrible idea. Who exactly are they going to be able to count on?\n\nFinally, this notion of it's a different time is just as nuts. This picture painted of men in the bowl 12 years ago being these knights in white riding around respectful of women is absurd. Men have been doing shit do women for thousands of years. It's not worse now than then. \n\nI have children this age. I am around these kids all the time. They should not be anywhere near sugaring, virgin or not. And if they are a virgin, my god.",

There is every chance that it will encourage others to become more incelly, and it wouldn't challenge the incels belief system, which is largely toxic because it supports their behaviour and demeanor. \n\nIf incels showed a vulnerable or compassionate side and got rewarded with sex then its happy days. \n\nUnfortunately women don't reward vulnerability, and sex remains competitive to men. The economy is fucked, wealth is disproportionate, so more men will become incels. \n\nThis won't change until chat gpt companion bots are viable",

They want women that can\u2019t sugar. They don\u2019t want women that are their peers. They don\u2019t want to woman that looks like they do. They want women that look like models. That\u2019s a very small amount of women when there are women that are overweight or women that are objectively unattractive just like there are unattractive men in those men think that pairing with those women is beneath them. There\u2019s a lot of lonely women on the world. But the world does it tell them that they\u2019re entitled to a relationship. It tells me that they are entitled to women and that is the problem. These men are internally abusive and controlling. You should look up what happened when men got a hold of companions in AI or chatterbox they immediately became abusive toward them. So if we\u2019re going to make a robot that looks like a woman expect those robots to literally be done horrendously. And this man would\u2019ve taken that behavior to General women",

But even then we already had heated discussions and bad experiences on SA blog.\n\nI would add:\n\n1. At age 18 you just *CAN'T* have the life experience to be prepared to handle the experienced, adult, bad actors preying on you.\n2. Thinking you [*CAN*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) is your biggest pitfall, lbecause for your safety you are relying on something completely  inexistent.\n3. Your teenage brain is still focussed on short term satisfaction, and not developed yet to oversee risks and LT consequences.\n4. You don't have enough vanilla/peer experience to counterbalance for your sugar experiences and understand what is 'normal' in relationships.\n5. Very, few normal middle aged men are interested in LT relationships with teenagers. So your sugar experiences will most likely be a row of one offs with men who want to check off a 'barely legal' or 'pop the cherry' sexual bucket list thingy .\n6. Your view on men and relationships will get warped at best, ruined at worst.\n7. Sex and money will  be connected like a Pavlov dog. It will be very hard to find a satisfying future vanilla relationship with a 'normal' guy your age.\n\nSo to all the adult men wanting to date teenagers and justifying themselves with the 'she is so mature' mantra.\n\nNo she is not. She cannot be. She just hasn't lived long enough to be!\n\nDon't do damage, don't let your selfish, horny, fantasy ruin her future.  And if you still do, than don't call her 'a jaded prostitute' at age 21, when you and all the other 'SDs' have turned her into one.\n\nIf you ask yourself why am I always so fanatic about this subject and  would die on this hill? Because I was 19 myself when I had my first 'Sugar relationship' (although it wasn't yet called sugar then)  And I am also the mum of teenagers, and fooled daily by their adult bodies with teenage brains.\n\nPlease SB's and SD's, wait at last till age 21!",

The onus is on the older, more experienced men involved to do their absolute best to make it an experience upon which the SB will look back with fondness and no regrets, as HL does her first experience.

There\u2019s an expectation of sex that didn\u2019t really exist when I first started sugaring and even when I had to go back to it a few years ago. One of the things that kept sugaring more respectable was how tightknit community was and not only that but how small it was it kept it respectable and it kept certain demographics of men and sugar babies out of it. We weren\u2019t escorts and we weren\u2019t necessarily pros. It was a fine line but it was easier to navigate because there were some boundaries and now it\u2019s way too difficult to see clearly. Take your time, learn who you are as a woman, understand what you need and why you\u2019re doing this. Then do whatever you wanna do but I would advise while you\u2019re doing it be in therapy and keep your eyes open.

Many 18/19 year olds are too young for this kind of thing (*in my opinion!)* and their maturity isn't in a place where I would pursue anything.\n\nSome, however, are ***women,*** clearly capable of making their own decisions about their bodies and their lives. They tend to be a little more open-minded sexually, which is nice and refreshing because for most of us... life is a continuum of becoming much less open minded.\n\nBut mostly they tend to be a little less down on the world, a little more open to possibilities. They tend to have lovely skin and soft touch. They're *easy to be around*. \n\nAlso, they tend not be jaded about the bowl. They haven't been in it as long. They aren't necessarily in some sort of \"revenue maximization\" exercise (exceptions apply).\n\nWhat do I see in them? A chance to be with someone young and sexy. A chance to be kind to that person, not just financially but also emotionally and physically. A chance to help them learn to put up boundaries, to see what explicit consent really looks like. Before you accuse me of \"white knighting\", please understand if I meet someone desperate, in need of serious help, or interested in becoming dependent... I politely walk away.\n\nThe 18/19 year olds that are successful in the bowl don't *need* the money to get by. They need it to live a little, to save a little, to pay for classes or books a little. They don't need the bowl, they want the bowl. They like to be with older men *for whatever reasons they like it.*\n\nThis is 6 years of experience speaking. It's a small-ish sample.",

You are the arbiter of all things?\n\n>Just saying I\u2019m sorry to burst your bubble but you probably still believe there\u2019s ones that actually like people more than twice their age\n\nThere are. I'm sorry you can't understand that. I've dated, on and off, a woman from 19-22. *Sure there is a transaction*. She doesn't actually, however, need the money. She gets plenty of sexual satisfaction out of our time together (and, please, don't tell me I don't know that for sure... *because I know it for sure*). We have stayed friends over the years and will see one another again I'm quite sure.\n\nI also had another arrangement where she was 19 when we met and 21 when it ended and she moved on to a vanilla partner. Never mind the again certainty she enjoyed the physical part; I'll just tell you that she expressed (as did I) genuine emotion for me in some rather specific ways. ***You don't have to think this is real or ok, but it was both***. \n\nI'm not -- in any way -- suggested the average 19-year-old woman can have a sexually satisfying, emotionally valuable SR with a man in his 40s, 50s, whatever. But there are definitely some that can. \n\n>I\u2019m just being honest about how I feel.\n\nYou're totally ok to do that. And I'm telling you that others can and do feel differently. And that you're feelings shouldn't be considered a substitute for the lived experiences of other people.",

When said marriage was opened, it was tempting to date older (relative to the bowl) women and try to be very clear on the boundaries of what I could offer in that scenario, i.e. no life-long commitment.\n\nIt didn't work.\n\nThen I was introduced to the bowl and my handful of SBs over the years have all understood the boundaries, even the two with whom love was expressed mutually. It's great to have a friend who is both simultaneously so different (the \"generation gap\") and also so compatible (we are both there for compartmentalized companionship, for \"mutual benefits\" which include both sex and financial support). \n\nThat the women are typically: more open-minded sexually, less clingy, more clear on what's going to happen on our dates just makes it all that much more simple. It doesn't mean we're not friends -- I don't stick around unless we clearly us. It doesn't mean we don't care for another -- experience tells me we clearly have. The guard rails of the arrangement haven't stopped us enjoying food, fun outings, travel together.\n\nBut they have stopped us from having a conversation where she asks for a baby, or a life partner, or to move in together. \n\nI won't discuss the specifics of money because forum rules forbid it. I will say over several years you can assume that the total is in the six figures...",

I have talked her out of that, for now, after convincing her of the long-term reputational risks. I had no idea how OF is so normalized now, with the 18 year old crowd.\n\nHer allowance is high enough, that she can save most of it (she still lives with her parents, and will be a freshman in September, on full scholarship). So now I'm teaching her about index funds, and not to spend big money on bags, shoes, etc.\n\nBut yes, I agree with you. Most 18 year olds should tread with caution if they go on SA, and definitely not do OnlyFans in most scenarios. The only exception with the latter might be if they are doing something like non-nude modeling (and not sleeping with anyone).",

You also said her allowance is high enough that she can save most of it but she seems to have almost zero bills. OF is very normalized now, so if she's not planning on running for office, what are your qualms with it? I'm assuming her face was already plastered on SA, and some girls do OF and obscure their face anyway.\n\nMy issue with girls this young is some men, and i'm not saying you're one of them, use this \"trust me i'm one of the good guys\" facade as a manipulative tool. Men can have decades sharpening these tools to get these girls to do what they want.",

I'm not an overly opinionated person but this post is troubling:\n\nPoint by point:\n\n\\- An 18 year old can't really know themself. Frontal cortex development is still several years away. So no matter how mature they think they are, they are not.\n\n\\- An 18 year old virgin does not possess anywhere near the tools required to say no and mean it. \n\n\\- Who is an 18 year old, a virgin no less, going to find to be in their corner? An 18 year old friend? That's a terrible idea. Who exactly are they going to be able to count on?\n\nFinally, this notion of it's a different time is just as nuts. This picture painted of men in the bowl 12 years ago being these knights in white riding around respectful of women is absurd. Men have been doing shit do women for thousands of years. It's not worse now than then. \n\nI have children this age. I am around these kids all the time. They should not be anywhere near sugaring, virgin or not. And if they are a virgin, my god.",

They tend to be a little more open-minded sexually, which is nice and refreshing because for most of us... life is a continuum of becoming much less open minded.\n\nBut mostly they tend to be a little less down on the world, a little more open to possibilities. They tend to have lovely skin and soft touch. They're *easy to be around*. \n\nAlso, they tend not be jaded about the bowl. They haven't been in it as long. They aren't necessarily in some sort of \"revenue maximization\" exercise (exceptions apply).\n\nWhat do I see in them? A chance to be with someone young and sexy. A chance to be kind to that person, not just financially but also emotionally and physically. A chance to help them learn to put up boundaries, to see what explicit consent really looks like. Before you accuse me of \"white knighting\", please understand if I meet someone desperate, in need of serious help, or interested in becoming dependent... I politely walk away.\n\nThe 18/19 year olds that are successful in the bowl don't *need* the money to get by. They need it to live a little, to save a little, to pay for classes or books a little. They don't need the bowl, they want the bowl. They like to be with older men *for whatever reasons they like it.*\n\nThis is 6 years of experience speaking. It's a small-ish sample.",

You are the arbiter of all things?\n\n>Just saying I\u2019m sorry to burst your bubble but you probably still believe there\u2019s ones that actually like people more than twice their age\n\nThere are. I'm sorry you can't understand that. I've dated, on and off, a woman from 19-22. *Sure there is a transaction*. She doesn't actually, however, need the money. She gets plenty of sexual satisfaction out of our time together (and, please, don't tell me I don't know that for sure... *because I know it for sure*). We have stayed friends over the years and will see one another again I'm quite sure.\n\nI also had another arrangement where she was 19 when we met and 21 when it ended and she moved on to a vanilla partner. Never mind the again certainty she enjoyed the physical part; I'll just tell you that she expressed (as did I) genuine emotion for me in some rather specific ways. ***You don't have to think this is real or ok, but it was both***. \n\nI'm not -- in any way -- suggested the average 19-year-old woman can have a sexually satisfying, emotionally valuable SR with a man in his 40s, 50s, whatever. But there are definitely some that can. \n\n>I\u2019m just being honest about how I feel.\n\nYou're totally ok to do that. And I'm telling you that others can and do feel differently. And that you're feelings shouldn't be considered a substitute for the lived experiences of other people.",

Do what makes you comfortable always. I hope I didn't come across as trying to persuade *anyone* to follow the examples I was setting or even to suggest they are some sort of easy to achieve thing.\n\n>Sorry for being a hater! I\u2019m glad you have good experiences with young ladies! I have a question what makes people choose sugar relationships instead of regular? Why did you choose it? How much money or presents do you give to the babies? What got you into this hobby?\n\nAgain, we're good. All apologies accepted.\n\nI have a very happy marriage. It is also sexless. When said marriage was opened, it was tempting to date older (relative to the bowl) women and try to be very clear on the boundaries of what I could offer in that scenario, i.e. no life-long commitment.\n\nIt didn't work.\n\nThen I was introduced to the bowl and my handful of SBs over the years have all understood the boundaries, even the two with whom love was expressed mutually. It's great to have a friend who is both simultaneously so different (the \"generation gap\") and also so compatible (we are both there for compartmentalized companionship, for \"mutual benefits\" which include both sex and financial support). \n\nThat the women are typically: more open-minded sexually, less clingy, more clear on what's going to happen on our dates just makes it all that much more simple. It doesn't mean we're not friends -- I don't stick around unless we clearly us. It doesn't mean we don't care for another -- experience tells me we clearly have. The guard rails of the arrangement haven't stopped us enjoying food, fun outings, travel together.\n\nBut they have stopped us from having a conversation where she asks for a baby, or a life partner, or to move in together. \n\nI won't discuss the specifics of money because forum rules forbid it. I will say over several years you can assume that the total is in the six figures...",

I'm not an overly opinionated person but this post is troubling:\n\nPoint by point:\n\n\\- An 18 year old can't really know themself. Frontal cortex development is still several years away. So no matter how mature they think they are, they are not.\n\n\\- An 18 year old virgin does not possess anywhere near the tools required to say no and mean it. \n\n\\- Who is an 18 year old, a virgin no less, going to find to be in their corner? An 18 year old friend? That's a terrible idea. Who exactly are they going to be able to count on?\n\nFinally, this notion of it's a different time is just as nuts. This picture painted of men in the bowl 12 years ago being these knights in white riding around respectful of women is absurd. Men have been doing shit do women for thousands of years. It's not worse now than then. \n\nI have children this age. I am around these kids all the time. They should not be anywhere near sugaring, virgin or not. And if they are a virgin, my god.",

There\u2019s a lot of lonely women on the world. But the world does it tell them that they\u2019re entitled to a relationship. It tells me that they are entitled to women and that is the problem.

You are the arbiter of all things?\n\n>Just saying I\u2019m sorry to burst your bubble but you probably still believe there\u2019s ones that actually like people more than twice their age\n\nThere are. I'm sorry you can't understand that. I've dated, on and off, a woman from 19-22. *Sure there is a transaction*. She doesn't actually, however, need the money. She gets plenty of sexual satisfaction out of our time together (and, please, don't tell me I don't know that for sure... *because I know it for sure*). We have stayed friends over the years and will see one another again I'm quite sure.\n\nI also had another arrangement where she was 19 when we met and 21 when it ended and she moved on to a vanilla partner. Never mind the again certainty she enjoyed the physical part; I'll just tell you that she expressed (as did I) genuine emotion for me in some rather specific ways. ***You don't have to think this is real or ok, but it was both***. \n\nI'm not -- in any way -- suggested the average 19-year-old woman can have a sexually satisfying, emotionally valuable SR with a man in his 40s, 50s, whatever. But there are definitely some that can. \n\n>I\u2019m just being honest about how I feel.\n\nYou're totally ok to do that. And I'm telling you that others can and do feel differently. And that you're feelings shouldn't be considered a substitute for the lived experiences of other people.",

And for what it's worth, I hate these men for what they did to you. I hope they find their own special place in hell if they haven't already.\n\n>And I was just using them for free drugs and alcohol while having no more consent seemed to be the exchange and I was too much of a delusional depressed alcoholic to see how I was harming myself at the time.\n\nUgh, that's awful. I'm so sorry you experienced that.\n\n>Once I got sober I only had boyfriends my same age or younger. I was just conditioned to find them so much nicer and less threatening\n\nYour body, your life. Do what makes you comfortable always. I hope I didn't come across as trying to persuade *anyone* to follow the examples I was setting or even to suggest they are some sort of easy to achieve thing.\n\n>Sorry for being a hater! I\u2019m glad you have good experiences with young ladies! I have a question what makes people choose sugar relationships instead of regular? Why did you choose it? How much money or presents do you give to the babies? What got you into this hobby?\n\nAgain, we're good. All apologies accepted.\n\nI have a very happy marriage. It is also sexless. When said marriage was opened, it was tempting to date older (relative to the bowl) women and try to be very clear on the boundaries of what I could offer in that scenario, i.e. no life-long commitment.\n\nIt didn't work.\n\nThen I was introduced to the bowl and my handful of SBs over the years have all understood the boundaries, even the two with whom love was expressed mutually. It's great to have a friend who is both simultaneously so different (the \"generation gap\") and also so compatible (we are both there for compartmentalized companionship, for \"mutual benefits\" which include both sex and financial support). \n\nThat the women are typically: more open-minded sexually, less clingy, more clear on what's going to happen on our dates just makes it all that much more simple. It doesn't mean we're not friends -- I don't stick around unless we clearly us. It doesn't mean we don't care for another -- experience tells me we clearly have. The guard rails of the arrangement haven't stopped us enjoying food, fun outings, travel together.\n\nBut they have stopped us from having a conversation where she asks for a baby, or a life partner, or to move in together. \n\nI won't discuss the specifics of money because forum rules forbid it. I will say over several years you can assume that the total is in the six figures...",

An 18 year old friend? That's a terrible idea. Who exactly are they going to be able to count on?\n\nFinally, this notion of it's a different time is just as nuts.

The mental exercise of \u201cwhat about me is attractive to the kind of man I want\u201d helped a lot.  I studied habits of attractive women and did what they did.  People saw me trying and gave me advice.  It worked.  I thought it was important to return the favor and help these guys out.  After all, I had been where they were.  It didn\u2019t go well.",

Whereas women are simply more favourable towards a smaller percentage of men. \n\nSo if you reward an incels behaviour with sex. There is every chance that it will encourage others to become more incelly, and it wouldn't challenge the incels belief system, which is largely toxic because it supports their behaviour and demeanor. \n\nIf incels showed a vulnerable or compassionate side and got rewarded with sex then its happy days. \n\nUnfortunately women don't reward vulnerability, and sex remains competitive to men. The economy is fucked, wealth is disproportionate, so more men will become incels. \n\nThis won't change until chat gpt companion bots are viable",

They immediately started becoming abusive toward them. Secondly there is a lot of women available that would date a lot of the Incels if in sales had standards that were realistic. They want women that can\u2019t sugar. They don\u2019t want women that are their peers. They don\u2019t want to woman that looks like they do. They want women that look like models. That\u2019s a very small amount of women when there are women that are overweight or women that are objectively unattractive just like there are unattractive men in those men think that pairing with those women is beneath them. There\u2019s a lot of lonely women on the world. But the world does it tell them that they\u2019re entitled to a relationship. It tells me that they are entitled to women and that is the problem. These men are internally abusive and controlling. You should look up what happened when men got a hold of companions in AI or chatterbox they immediately became abusive toward them. So if we\u2019re going to make a robot that looks like a woman expect those robots to literally be done horrendously. And this man would\u2019ve taken that behavior to General women",

You are the arbiter of all things?\n\n>Just saying I\u2019m sorry to burst your bubble but you probably still believe there\u2019s ones that actually like people more than twice their age\n\nThere are. I'm sorry you can't understand that. I've dated, on and off, a woman from 19-22. *Sure there is a transaction*. She doesn't actually, however, need the money. She gets plenty of sexual satisfaction out of our time together (and, please, don't tell me I don't know that for sure... *because I know it for sure*). We have stayed friends over the years and will see one another again I'm quite sure.\n\nI also had another arrangement where she was 19 when we met and 21 when it ended and she moved on to a vanilla partner. Never mind the again certainty she enjoyed the physical part; I'll just tell you that she expressed (as did I) genuine emotion for me in some rather specific ways. ***You don't have to think this is real or ok, but it was both***. \n\nI'm not -- in any way -- suggested the average 19-year-old woman can have a sexually satisfying, emotionally valuable SR with a man in his 40s, 50s, whatever. But there are definitely some that can. \n\n>I\u2019m just being honest about how I feel.\n\nYou're totally ok to do that. And I'm telling you that others can and do feel differently. And that you're feelings shouldn't be considered a substitute for the lived experiences of other people.",

I hope they find their own special place in hell if they haven't already.\n\n>And I was just using them for free drugs and alcohol while having no more consent seemed to be the exchange and I was too much of a delusional depressed alcoholic to see how I was harming myself at the time.\n\nUgh, that's awful. I'm so sorry you experienced that.\n\n>Once I got sober I only had boyfriends my same age or younger. I was just conditioned to find them so much nicer and less threatening\n\nYour body, your life. Do what makes you comfortable always. I hope I didn't come across as trying to persuade *anyone* to follow the examples I was setting or even to suggest they are some sort of easy to achieve thing.\n\n>Sorry for being a hater! I\u2019m glad you have good experiences with young ladies! I have a question what makes people choose sugar relationships instead of regular? Why did you choose it? How much money or presents do you give to the babies? What got you into this hobby?\n\nAgain, we're good. All apologies accepted.\n\nI have a very happy marriage. It is also sexless. When said marriage was opened, it was tempting to date older (relative to the bowl) women and try to be very clear on the boundaries of what I could offer in that scenario, i.e. no life-long commitment.\n\nIt didn't work.\n\nThen I was introduced to the bowl and my handful of SBs over the years have all understood the boundaries, even the two with whom love was expressed mutually. It's great to have a friend who is both simultaneously so different (the \"generation gap\") and also so compatible (we are both there for compartmentalized companionship, for \"mutual benefits\" which include both sex and financial support). \n\nThat the women are typically: more open-minded sexually, less clingy, more clear on what's going to happen on our dates just makes it all that much more simple. It doesn't mean we're not friends -- I don't stick around unless we clearly us. It doesn't mean we don't care for another -- experience tells me we clearly have. The guard rails of the arrangement haven't stopped us enjoying food, fun outings, travel together.\n\nBut they have stopped us from having a conversation where she asks for a baby, or a life partner, or to move in together. \n\nI won't discuss the specifics of money because forum rules forbid it. I will say over several years you can assume that the total is in the six figures...",

You are the arbiter of all things?\n\n>Just saying I\u2019m sorry to burst your bubble but you probably still believe there\u2019s ones that actually like people more than twice their age\n\nThere are. I'm sorry you can't understand that. I've dated, on and off, a woman from 19-22. *Sure there is a transaction*. She doesn't actually, however, need the money. She gets plenty of sexual satisfaction out of our time together (and, please, don't tell me I don't know that for sure... *because I know it for sure*). We have stayed friends over the years and will see one another again I'm quite sure.\n\nI also had another arrangement where she was 19 when we met and 21 when it ended and she moved on to a vanilla partner. Never mind the again certainty she enjoyed the physical part; I'll just tell you that she expressed (as did I) genuine emotion for me in some rather specific ways. ***You don't have to think this is real or ok, but it was both***. \n\nI'm not -- in any way -- suggested the average 19-year-old woman can have a sexually satisfying, emotionally valuable SR with a man in his 40s, 50s, whatever. But there are definitely some that can. \n\n>I\u2019m just being honest about how I feel.\n\nYou're totally ok to do that. And I'm telling you that others can and do feel differently. And that you're feelings shouldn't be considered a substitute for the lived experiences of other people.",

Do what makes you comfortable always. I hope I didn't come across as trying to persuade *anyone* to follow the examples I was setting or even to suggest they are some sort of easy to achieve thing.\n\n>Sorry for being a hater! I\u2019m glad you have good experiences with young ladies! I have a question what makes people choose sugar relationships instead of regular? Why did you choose it? How much money or presents do you give to the babies? What got you into this hobby?\n\nAgain, we're good. All apologies accepted.\n\nI have a very happy marriage. It is also sexless. When said marriage was opened, it was tempting to date older (relative to the bowl) women and try to be very clear on the boundaries of what I could offer in that scenario, i.e. no life-long commitment.\n\nIt didn't work.\n\nThen I was introduced to the bowl and my handful of SBs over the years have all understood the boundaries, even the two with whom love was expressed mutually. It's great to have a friend who is both simultaneously so different (the \"generation gap\") and also so compatible (we are both there for compartmentalized companionship, for \"mutual benefits\" which include both sex and financial support). \n\nThat the women are typically: more open-minded sexually, less clingy, more clear on what's going to happen on our dates just makes it all that much more simple. It doesn't mean we're not friends -- I don't stick around unless we clearly us. It doesn't mean we don't care for another -- experience tells me we clearly have. The guard rails of the arrangement haven't stopped us enjoying food, fun outings, travel together.\n\nBut they have stopped us from having a conversation where she asks for a baby, or a life partner, or to move in together. \n\nI won't discuss the specifics of money because forum rules forbid it. I will say over several years you can assume that the total is in the six figures...",

They want women that can\u2019t sugar. They don\u2019t want women that are their peers. They don\u2019t want to woman that looks like they do. They want women that look like models. That\u2019s a very small amount of women when there are women that are overweight or women that are objectively unattractive just like there are unattractive men in those men think that pairing with those women is beneath them. There\u2019s a lot of lonely women on the world. But the world does it tell them that they\u2019re entitled to a relationship. It tells me that they are entitled to women and that is the problem. These men are internally abusive and controlling. You should look up what happened when men got a hold of companions in AI or chatterbox they immediately became abusive toward them.

You are the arbiter of all things?\n\n>Just saying I\u2019m sorry to burst your bubble but you probably still believe there\u2019s ones that actually like people more than twice their age\n\nThere are. I'm sorry you can't understand that. I've dated, on and off, a woman from 19-22. *Sure there is a transaction*. She doesn't actually, however, need the money. She gets plenty of sexual satisfaction out of our time together (and, please, don't tell me I don't know that for sure... *because I know it for sure*). We have stayed friends over the years and will see one another again I'm quite sure.\n\nI also had another arrangement where she was 19 when we met and 21 when it ended and she moved on to a vanilla partner. Never mind the again certainty she enjoyed the physical part; I'll just tell you that she expressed (as did I) genuine emotion for me in some rather specific ways. ***You don't have to think this is real or ok, but it was both***. \n\nI'm not -- in any way -- suggested the average 19-year-old woman can have a sexually satisfying, emotionally valuable SR with a man in his 40s, 50s, whatever. But there are definitely some that can. \n\n>I\u2019m just being honest about how I feel.\n\nYou're totally ok to do that. And I'm telling you that others can and do feel differently. And that you're feelings shouldn't be considered a substitute for the lived experiences of other people.",

Do what makes you comfortable always. I hope I didn't come across as trying to persuade *anyone* to follow the examples I was setting or even to suggest they are some sort of easy to achieve thing.\n\n>Sorry for being a hater! I\u2019m glad you have good experiences with young ladies! I have a question what makes people choose sugar relationships instead of regular? Why did you choose it? How much money or presents do you give to the babies? What got you into this hobby?\n\nAgain, we're good. All apologies accepted.\n\nI have a very happy marriage. It is also sexless. When said marriage was opened, it was tempting to date older (relative to the bowl) women and try to be very clear on the boundaries of what I could offer in that scenario, i.e. no life-long commitment.\n\nIt didn't work.\n\nThen I was introduced to the bowl and my handful of SBs over the years have all understood the boundaries, even the two with whom love was expressed mutually. It's great to have a friend who is both simultaneously so different (the \"generation gap\") and also so compatible (we are both there for compartmentalized companionship, for \"mutual benefits\" which include both sex and financial support). \n\nThat the women are typically: more open-minded sexually, less clingy, more clear on what's going to happen on our dates just makes it all that much more simple. It doesn't mean we're not friends -- I don't stick around unless we clearly us. It doesn't mean we don't care for another -- experience tells me we clearly have. The guard rails of the arrangement haven't stopped us enjoying food, fun outings, travel together.\n\nBut they have stopped us from having a conversation where she asks for a baby, or a life partner, or to move in together. \n\nI won't discuss the specifics of money because forum rules forbid it. I will say over several years you can assume that the total is in the six figures...",

They want women that can\u2019t sugar. They don\u2019t want women that are their peers. They don\u2019t want to woman that looks like they do. They want women that look like models.

There\u2019s a lot of lonely women on the world. But the world does it tell them that they\u2019re entitled to a relationship. It tells me that they are entitled to women and that is the problem. These men are internally abusive and controlling. You should look up what happened when men got a hold of companions in AI or chatterbox they immediately became abusive toward them.

I'm sorry you can't understand that. I've dated, on and off, a woman from 19-22. *Sure there is a transaction*. She doesn't actually, however, need the money. She gets plenty of sexual satisfaction out of our time together (and, please, don't tell me I don't know that for sure... *because I know it for sure*). We have stayed friends over the years and will see one another again I'm quite sure.\n\nI also had another arrangement where she was 19 when we met and 21 when it ended and she moved on to a vanilla partner. Never mind the again certainty she enjoyed the physical part; I'll just tell you that she expressed (as did I) genuine emotion for me in some rather specific ways. ***You don't have to think this is real or ok, but it was both***. \n\nI'm not -- in any way -- suggested the average 19-year-old woman can have a sexually satisfying, emotionally valuable SR with a man in his 40s, 50s, whatever. But there are definitely some that can. \n\n>I\u2019m just being honest about how I feel.\n\nYou're totally ok to do that. And I'm telling you that others can and do feel differently.

How much money or presents do you give to the babies? What got you into this hobby?\n\nAgain, we're good. All apologies accepted.\n\nI have a very happy marriage. It is also sexless. When said marriage was opened, it was tempting to date older (relative to the bowl) women and try to be very clear on the boundaries of what I could offer in that scenario, i.e. no life-long commitment.\n\nIt didn't work.\n\nThen I was introduced to the bowl and my handful of SBs over the years have all understood the boundaries, even the two with whom love was expressed mutually. It's great to have a friend who is both simultaneously so different (the \"generation gap\") and also so compatible (we are both there for compartmentalized companionship, for \"mutual benefits\" which include both sex and financial support). \n\nThat the women are typically: more open-minded sexually, less clingy, more clear on what's going to happen on our dates just makes it all that much more simple. It doesn't mean we're not friends -- I don't stick around unless we clearly us. It doesn't mean we don't care for another -- experience tells me we clearly have. The guard rails of the arrangement haven't stopped us enjoying food, fun outings, travel together.\n\nBut they have stopped us from having a conversation where she asks for a baby, or a life partner, or to move in together. \n\nI won't discuss the specifics of money because forum rules forbid it. I will say over several years you can assume that the total is in the six figures...",

It was 2 hours long and the girl didn\u2019t follow directions no matter how much I repeated them or showed her. I\u2019m left feeling so bad about myself. and I feel like I spent the whole day there for this. How are you? Did you have a young lady today?",

I wish I could get paid to be friends with someone! As long as there wasn\u2019t too much sex lol but I\u2019m sure that doesn\u2019t exist lol!",
