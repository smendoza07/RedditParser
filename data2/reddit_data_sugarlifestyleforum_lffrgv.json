    "body": "Hey y\u2019all, so a couple weeks ago I posted about having issues finding someone in Oklahoma. Well looks like the sugar heavens opened up and blessed me \ud83d\ude02 Went to a cigar bar a couple nights ago, and this man was so struck when he saw me walk in. He automatically came up to me and told me I was beautiful! Took care of me and my friends drinks the whole night and even went to the next bar with us and paid again \ud83d\ude06. He text me to have sushi with him before super bowl, so I went, and I told him about a trip I\u2019m taking and he gave me 1100!!!!! Upgraded my flight to first class and got me a better hotel. SO CRAZY! I was about to throw the towel in and take a break from sugaring and he comes from no where! So with that being said, to all my fellow babies who are struggling, DONT GIVE UP, the universe has a funny way of working \u2728",
