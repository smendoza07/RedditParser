    "body": "I saw this a lot amongst SDs and noticed a pattern. SDs who tell me how much they really get off on making their SBs feel good.... but yet they very very rarely ask what I like, and never ask if I'm enjoying what they're already doing. It tends to give the impression that they don't actually get off on making their SB feel good, they just get off on feeling like they're good in bed. \n\nGuys, in any and all relationships, communication is important. I've gotten quite a few SDs in my DMs asking for advice on what to do during my time in this subreddit and quite a few have asked me what their SB likes and how to make her feel good. Idk. I'm not your SB. If you don't know what your SB likes in bed... ask her. Communicate. You can't read minds and neither can she, so if you're not sure what someone enjoys, Ask. Them. \n\nI say this specifically to SDs who want to make their SBs feel good because I'm well aware that there are probably a lot of SDs who just want to pay to not have to care about if they're good in bed... which... fair. But if you do want to make her feel good then ffs just ask her if what you're doing is making her feel good. The sexiest thing in a relationship is communication skills.",

Experience also helps in that, I have lived a long (late 50's) and varied life, with a reasonable number of partners, so that helps. I agree though, if you do not know or if it is not obvious, ask. There is no bad communication in my experience except when there is none. When I initially touch her and she is already very obviously physically ready because she already knows what I am going to do to her, and longs for it, sugar all besides, that is to me like the sexiest thing on the planet. :)",

(Some are willing to accept notes, some are not.  Some will learn from experience, some won't)\n\n3) There are some SDs who do know what they're doing and do care about their partner's pleasure.\n\nYou're not going to know which one your partner is until you end up in bed with them (although this equally applies in a vanilla relationship as well).

Seems odd to ask a random reddit person what a stranger might like.  That is like me asking you what you think my SBs favorite flavor of ice cream is or favorite meal.  The only person who can answer that is the SB herself.\n\nSexually speaking, tastes vary greatly.  Something one woman I know loves more than anything else, almost to the exclusion of all other things, another woman I know gets nothing from at all.\n\nSomeone who truly gets off on the empathetic feeling of giving pleasure, first and foremost, finds out from his or her partner what gives the most pleasure to that individual.\n\nI sometimes wonder if those who talk about how they love \"giving\" actually just love doing certain things (cough cough, eating pussy, cough cough) without necessarily finding out if the woman receiving it actually is all that into it.  I mean, it certainly is objectively a giving thing to do, in the same sense as a blow job, but that doesn't mean it is received the same by everyone.  Some women almost orgasm just from giving a blow job (or to hear them describe it).  Even if it isn't necessarily the man's favorite thing.\n\nAs you say, communication is key.  As is compatibility frankly.  I mean, if you are a SD who LOVES eating pussy, probably best to find out from a POT SB if she loves receiving it just as much, or else you may not really be a match.  This is why some level of conversation about such things is a good idea even before starting a SR.",

So I figured I would just have to do trial and error, read their body language and try to decipher the moans and other sounds coming out of their vocal chords.\n\nOn aside note, I will ask SBs what their boundaries are and they do communicate directly about sex (i.e. no cowgirl, no anal, no second female).\n\nTLDR: Most women do not communicate directly what makes them feel good.",

(Some are willing to accept notes, some are not.  Some will learn from experience, some won't)\n\n3) There are some SDs who do know what they're doing and do care about their partner's pleasure.\n\nYou're not going to know which one your partner is until you end up in bed with them (although this equally applies in a vanilla relationship as well).  As you quite rightly said:-\n\n>But if you do want to make her feel good then ffs just ask her if what you're doing is making her feel good.

(Some are willing to accept notes, some are not.  Some will learn from experience, some won't)\n\n3) There are some SDs who do know what they're doing and do care about their partner's pleasure.\n\nYou're not going to know which one your partner is until you end up in bed with them (although this equally applies in a vanilla relationship as well).  As you quite rightly said:-\n\n>But if you do want to make her feel good then ffs just ask her if what you're doing is making her feel good.
