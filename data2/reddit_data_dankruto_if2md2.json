Then of course, Minato sealed Kurama in him, meaning the vast majority of said reserves were used to hold the seal. Thanks Dad. \n\nKakashi taught him fuck all. Certainly less than Dai taught Gai and Gai taught Lee.

He still had no talent as a Shinobi and had to make up for that with clever work around a and hard work.\n\nNaruto did NOT inherit Ashura\u2019s power. Ashura was a parasite that attached himself to Naruto and tried to use him to further his own agenda. He was granted power by Hagoromo because Naruto had done so much to create peace and help the Bijuu.\n\nNaruto\u2019s bloodline is irrelevant save for a single thing, which is the Naruto-Sasuke dichotomy. \n\nAs for Guy, he was literally taught to use the Gates, objectively a more powerful and reliable ability than anything Naruto has until he creates Rasenshuriken and learns Sage Mode. He then passed than on to Lee. They were lucky to be born to Dai, and then picked up by Gai respectively. \n\nBesides, Naruto was never about Hard Work vs Talent. That was Lee\u2019s specific theme that because the Gaara vs Lee fight was so damn great became affixed in the minds of the fandom. Naruto\u2019s story was always predominantly about bonds and how they affect someone\u2019s life. Hence why during VOTE2\u2019s final clash, we don\u2019t get a highlight reel of their training, we see the hands of those who they are bonded with supporting them.",

His dad was an elite ninja of the highest caliber, Naruto got great genetics from him. NFL players are super athletically gifted and they pass their genes down to their children who also tend to be super talented. It\u2019s the same thing here.\n\n>Minato sealed Kurama in him\n\nKurama is literally Naruto\u2019s biggest power source. Also another gift given to him not earned (yes it made him a social outcast but power wise Kurama is one of the greatest gifts ever).\n\n>Kakashi taught him fuck all\n\nNaruto couldn\u2019t even hang upside down before Kakashi\u2019s training. \n\n>Jiraiya didn\u2019t give a shit about Naruto until Naruto used sexy justsu \n\nWho cares? Naruto was still taught by one of if not the greatest master in ninja history.\n\n>Naruto\u2019s heritage literally means fuck all\n\nSure, if you ignore that Kushina and Minato are his parents and that he\u2019s the reincarnation of the Sage of Six Path\u2019s son.\n\n>Naruto did NOT inherit Ashura\u2019s power\n\nYes he did he was the only one in the world at the time who could\u2019ve awakened Ashura\u2019s power. Not because he worked for it but because he was born with it, they even make a point about Naruto/Sasuke having always felt that it was there iirc.\n\nAnd no Ashura is not a parasite that attached to Naruto. Naruto *is* Ashura. He\u2019s his reincarnation, they technically are the same person. The same way Avatar Aang and Korra are the same person.\n\n>Naruto\u2019s bloodline is irrelevant\n\nHe literally gets most of his power from it. Even Kurama is technically part of it since he\u2019s inherited from one generation of the Uzumaki clan to the next.\n\n>Naruto was never about Hard Work vs Talent\n\nI partly agree. It wasn\u2019t his main theme but it was one of them. But the whole Neji fight was about fighting your fate (in Naruto\u2019s case it was being a trash ninja who the whole village despised). But then Naruto gets all these prophecies and bloodline revelations and has become a character who was always fated to be special.\n\n>He still had no talent as a Shinobi\n\nOriginally. Like I already said, the talentless guy works hard and makes a name for himself thing was clearly how the manga was originally going but then Kishimoto added all this prophecy and bloodline stuff and now Naruto is someone who was destined to be great from the start. \n\nIt lessens Naruto\u2019s previous achievements because it changed it from just a nobody who accomplished them to chosen one who was born to powerful parents and the literal reincarnation of a legend accomplished them. It changed it from a talentless nobody to a legend baby.",

That Minato was a great ninja doesn\u2019t matter. His genetics didn\u2019t help Naruto at all.\n\nYou are aware that Kurama was a net negative through most of Naruto\u2019s life right? He fucked with Naruto\u2019s control, most of Naruto\u2019s chakra was set in maintaining the seal etc. We literally see what Naruto would\u2019ve been without Kurama during Naruto vs Kurama and Naruto + Tobirama vs Obito. He was literally capable of kicking Kurama\u2019s ass solo with just Sage Mode and doing the most damage to Obito and fighting on the level of Tobirama fucking Senju with just Sage Mode. \n\nHagoromo didn\u2019t give Naruto Ashura\u2019s power. He gave him HIS power. Hamura showed by giving his chakra to Hinata that it can go to anyone. As  did Obito with Kakashi. It wasn\u2019t Ashura\u2019s POWER he felt, it was his presence. Naruto is NOT Ashura\u2019s reincarnation. That\u2019s a mistranslation. The correct word is \u201cTransmigrant\u201d. Spiritual successor, heir. These words are closer to the truth, which is why, you know, Hashirama and Naruto and Sasuke and Madara can exist concurrently.\n\nYou aren\u2019t understanding the fundamental facts here.

Neiji did not understand what Naruto was truly going through or what he overcame, so Neiji ended up being wrong on multiple fronts.\n\n(and also there was the bit about Naruto mastering shadow clone despite sucking at regular clones, which does unambiguously disprove Neiji's perception of Naruto, but w/e)",

Indra is the darkness and Asura is the light so Asura\u2019s chakra would not feel \u201cdark\u201d",

Thanks for commenting! \n\nI just wrote a lot about this on another post so I'm going to keep this a little short and specifically in context with Neji. \n\n- Nejis point is that your birth is important. If you are born a slave like him or a weakling like Hinata or Naruto, you are always that. \n\n- narutos point is that we have the power to change ourselves and choose our paths in life. If Hinata wants to be strong, she can do that. And if Neji wants to be free, he can fight for that freedom instead of settling for slavery. \n\n- if Naruto is just some orphan that has no talent people constantly shit on and then he works hard, tell people to fuck off, and forces them to acknowledge him as a great ninja, then this all makes sense. \n\n- HOWEVER if Naruto has a super special mom and dad, a magical lineage, and is the literal reincarnation of the son of God and the greatest known shinobi(hashirama) then . . . His point is meaningless. Yha maybe HE change the way his life works, but he was born a prince of the ninja world. While Neji was still 100% BORN A SLAVE.  So this whole part becomes a really weird version of a poor but free white person in the US telling a literal slave to simply become free.  It's hollow and kind of gross. \n\n- just a final note, it also takes away the contrast from him and Sasuke. Sasuke had the wild background of a genius and bloodline while Naruto had nothing. Then, they both had to work hard to get stronger. If Naruto has a magic bloodline, which canonically, he does, the Sasuke's line about being more special than Naruto is actually false and it makes sense that Naruto should succeed. Not only did he not lose his family, but he later finds out that he has a loving mother and father AND GETS TO MEET AND SAY GOOD BYE TO THEM! \n\nSo yha, not saying Naruto is bad. Just saying a huge part of his character and the first part of the series makes no sense with his new parentage and background.",

He realises this \u201cdestiny\u201d when Naruto meets Sasuke at the bridge after the 5 kage summit and realises that they will both die if they fight. \n\nThats their fate. They are destined to die at eachothers hands due to them being the reincarnation of Inda and Ashura. Thats exactly what Neji was talking about. That \u2018mark\u2019 being Naruto\u2019s destiny to die at the hands of Sasuke like MANY generations before them. If you are SOOO lucky to be a reincarnate why are only Naruto, Sasuke - Hashirama, Madara, the only ones mentioned. Because they are easily the strongest on their OWN terms. Black zetsu even states that it was incredibly RARE for the reincarnates to be working together. It was Naruto\u2019s perseverance that managed to break the cycle and curse of the two brothers because that literally the theme of Naruto.\n\nNaruto didn\u2019t need to like Sasuke. Naruto could\u2019ve easily grown up to hate him. Grown up to want to kill him like the others before him (which Hagaromo stated). The same way Hashirama tried to kill Madara. And the same way many Ashura descendants died before those two.\n\n(Unpopular opinion but) thats why the Neji v Naruto fight is my favourite in the entire series. It foreshadows the hardest thing Naruto has to face. When Neji talks about his mark and claims Naruto wouldn\u2019t understand, Naruto mentions the kyubi inside of him. Little does he know he is cursed the exact same way as Neji.",

(Funnily enough, the reincarnates are the only characters to have a \u201ctrue\u201d destiny, and that one destiny ends up being broken)\n\nAnd people also forget that in Jiraiya\u2019s prophecy, the destined child was destined to bring great peace OR destruction, which is ultimately up to the person.",

Did it give him more chakra? Talent? A Kekkei Genkai? No? Could it then be, that it means fuck all?\n\nAs for chakra reserves, sure. He did inherit large reserves from Kushina. Then of course, Minato sealed Kurama in him, meaning the vast majority of said reserves were used to hold the seal. Thanks Dad. \n\nKakashi taught him fuck all. Certainly less than Dai taught Gai and Gai taught Lee. Jiraiya didn\u2019t give a shit about Naruto until Naruto used Sexy Jutsu to get him to help with Water Walking, during which he impressed Jiraiya by soldiering through despite the seal on him.\n\nNaruto\u2019s heritage literally means fuck all. He still had no talent as a Shinobi and had to make up for that with clever work around a and hard work.\n\nNaruto did NOT inherit Ashura\u2019s power. Ashura was a parasite that attached himself to Naruto and tried to use him to further his own agenda. He was granted power by Hagoromo because Naruto had done so much to create peace and help the Bijuu.\n\nNaruto\u2019s bloodline is irrelevant save for a single thing, which is the Naruto-Sasuke dichotomy. \n\nAs for Guy, he was literally taught to use the Gates, objectively a more powerful and reliable ability than anything Naruto has until he creates Rasenshuriken and learns Sage Mode. He then passed than on to Lee. They were lucky to be born to Dai, and then picked up by Gai respectively. \n\nBesides, Naruto was never about Hard Work vs Talent. That was Lee\u2019s specific theme that because the Gaara vs Lee fight was so damn great became affixed in the minds of the fandom. Naruto\u2019s story was always predominantly about bonds and how they affect someone\u2019s life. Hence why during VOTE2\u2019s final clash, we don\u2019t get a highlight reel of their training, we see the hands of those who they are bonded with supporting them.",

His dad was an elite ninja of the highest caliber, Naruto got great genetics from him. NFL players are super athletically gifted and they pass their genes down to their children who also tend to be super talented. It\u2019s the same thing here.\n\n>Minato sealed Kurama in him\n\nKurama is literally Naruto\u2019s biggest power source. Also another gift given to him not earned (yes it made him a social outcast but power wise Kurama is one of the greatest gifts ever).\n\n>Kakashi taught him fuck all\n\nNaruto couldn\u2019t even hang upside down before Kakashi\u2019s training. \n\n>Jiraiya didn\u2019t give a shit about Naruto until Naruto used sexy justsu \n\nWho cares? Naruto was still taught by one of if not the greatest master in ninja history.\n\n>Naruto\u2019s heritage literally means fuck all\n\nSure, if you ignore that Kushina and Minato are his parents and that he\u2019s the reincarnation of the Sage of Six Path\u2019s son.\n\n>Naruto did NOT inherit Ashura\u2019s power\n\nYes he did he was the only one in the world at the time who could\u2019ve awakened Ashura\u2019s power. Not because he worked for it but because he was born with it, they even make a point about Naruto/Sasuke having always felt that it was there iirc.\n\nAnd no Ashura is not a parasite that attached to Naruto. Naruto *is* Ashura. He\u2019s his reincarnation, they technically are the same person. The same way Avatar Aang and Korra are the same person.\n\n>Naruto\u2019s bloodline is irrelevant\n\nHe literally gets most of his power from it. Even Kurama is technically part of it since he\u2019s inherited from one generation of the Uzumaki clan to the next.\n\n>Naruto was never about Hard Work vs Talent\n\nI partly agree. It wasn\u2019t his main theme but it was one of them. But the whole Neji fight was about fighting your fate (in Naruto\u2019s case it was being a trash ninja who the whole village despised). But then Naruto gets all these prophecies and bloodline revelations and has become a character who was always fated to be special.\n\n>He still had no talent as a Shinobi\n\nOriginally. Like I already said, the talentless guy works hard and makes a name for himself thing was clearly how the manga was originally going but then Kishimoto added all this prophecy and bloodline stuff and now Naruto is someone who was destined to be great from the start. \n\nIt lessens Naruto\u2019s previous achievements because it changed it from just a nobody who accomplished them to chosen one who was born to powerful parents and the literal reincarnation of a legend accomplished them. It changed it from a talentless nobody to a legend baby.",

He gave him HIS power. Hamura showed by giving his chakra to Hinata that it can go to anyone. As  did Obito with Kakashi. It wasn\u2019t Ashura\u2019s POWER he felt, it was his presence. Naruto is NOT Ashura\u2019s reincarnation. That\u2019s a mistranslation. The correct word is \u201cTransmigrant\u201d. Spiritual successor, heir. These words are closer to the truth, which is why, you know, Hashirama and Naruto and Sasuke and Madara can exist concurrently.\n\nYou aren\u2019t understanding the fundamental facts here. EVERYONE in the series got a lucky break in one way or another. It was what they did with it that mattered",

He was cursed with the nine tails and hated by the village. He suffered just like Neiji did, but unlike Neiji he used the source of his suffering to his advantage. Neiji did not understand what Naruto was truly going through or what he overcame, so Neiji ended up being wrong on multiple fronts.\n\n(and also there was the bit about Naruto mastering shadow clone despite sucking at regular clones, which does unambiguously disprove Neiji's perception of Naruto, but w/e)",

                    "body": "Yo. Thanks for commenting! \n\nI just wrote a lot about this on another post so I'm going to keep this a little short and specifically in context with Neji. \n\n- Nejis point is that your birth is important. If you are born a slave like him or a weakling like Hinata or Naruto, you are always that. \n\n- narutos point is that we have the power to change ourselves and choose our paths in life. If Hinata wants to be strong, she can do that. And if Neji wants to be free, he can fight for that freedom instead of settling for slavery. \n\n- if Naruto is just some orphan that has no talent people constantly shit on and then he works hard, tell people to fuck off, and forces them to acknowledge him as a great ninja, then this all makes sense. \n\n- HOWEVER if Naruto has a super special mom and dad, a magical lineage, and is the literal reincarnation of the son of God and the greatest known shinobi(hashirama) then . . . His point is meaningless. Yha maybe HE change the way his life works, but he was born a prince of the ninja world. While Neji was still 100% BORN A SLAVE.  So this whole part becomes a really weird version of a poor but free white person in the US telling a literal slave to simply become free.  It's hollow and kind of gross. \n\n- just a final note, it also takes away the contrast from him and Sasuke. Sasuke had the wild background of a genius and bloodline while Naruto had nothing. Then, they both had to work hard to get stronger. If Naruto has a magic bloodline, which canonically, he does, the Sasuke's line about being more special than Naruto is actually false and it makes sense that Naruto should succeed. Not only did he not lose his family, but he later finds out that he has a loving mother and father AND GETS TO MEET AND SAY GOOD BYE TO THEM! \n\nSo yha, not saying Naruto is bad. Just saying a huge part of his character and the first part of the series makes no sense with his new parentage and background.",

Then of course, Minato sealed Kurama in him, meaning the vast majority of said reserves were used to hold the seal. Thanks Dad. \n\nKakashi taught him fuck all. Certainly less than Dai taught Gai and Gai taught Lee. Jiraiya didn\u2019t give a shit about Naruto until Naruto used Sexy Jutsu to get him to help with Water Walking, during which he impressed Jiraiya by soldiering through despite the seal on him.\n\nNaruto\u2019s heritage literally means fuck all. He still had no talent as a Shinobi and had to make up for that with clever work around a and hard work.\n\nNaruto did NOT inherit Ashura\u2019s power. Ashura was a parasite that attached himself to Naruto and tried to use him to further his own agenda. He was granted power by Hagoromo because Naruto had done so much to create peace and help the Bijuu.\n\nNaruto\u2019s bloodline is irrelevant save for a single thing, which is the Naruto-Sasuke dichotomy. \n\nAs for Guy, he was literally taught to use the Gates, objectively a more powerful and reliable ability than anything Naruto has until he creates Rasenshuriken and learns Sage Mode. He then passed than on to Lee. They were lucky to be born to Dai, and then picked up by Gai respectively. \n\nBesides, Naruto was never about Hard Work vs Talent. That was Lee\u2019s specific theme that because the Gaara vs Lee fight was so damn great became affixed in the minds of the fandom. Naruto\u2019s story was always predominantly about bonds and how they affect someone\u2019s life. Hence why during VOTE2\u2019s final clash, we don\u2019t get a highlight reel of their training, we see the hands of those who they are bonded with supporting them.",

His dad was an elite ninja of the highest caliber, Naruto got great genetics from him. NFL players are super athletically gifted and they pass their genes down to their children who also tend to be super talented. It\u2019s the same thing here.\n\n>Minato sealed Kurama in him\n\nKurama is literally Naruto\u2019s biggest power source. Also another gift given to him not earned (yes it made him a social outcast but power wise Kurama is one of the greatest gifts ever).\n\n>Kakashi taught him fuck all\n\nNaruto couldn\u2019t even hang upside down before Kakashi\u2019s training. \n\n>Jiraiya didn\u2019t give a shit about Naruto until Naruto used sexy justsu \n\nWho cares? Naruto was still taught by one of if not the greatest master in ninja history.\n\n>Naruto\u2019s heritage literally means fuck all\n\nSure, if you ignore that Kushina and Minato are his parents and that he\u2019s the reincarnation of the Sage of Six Path\u2019s son.\n\n>Naruto did NOT inherit Ashura\u2019s power\n\nYes he did he was the only one in the world at the time who could\u2019ve awakened Ashura\u2019s power. Not because he worked for it but because he was born with it, they even make a point about Naruto/Sasuke having always felt that it was there iirc.\n\nAnd no Ashura is not a parasite that attached to Naruto. Naruto *is* Ashura. He\u2019s his reincarnation, they technically are the same person. The same way Avatar Aang and Korra are the same person.\n\n>Naruto\u2019s bloodline is irrelevant\n\nHe literally gets most of his power from it. Even Kurama is technically part of it since he\u2019s inherited from one generation of the Uzumaki clan to the next.\n\n>Naruto was never about Hard Work vs Talent\n\nI partly agree. It wasn\u2019t his main theme but it was one of them. But the whole Neji fight was about fighting your fate (in Naruto\u2019s case it was being a trash ninja who the whole village despised). But then Naruto gets all these prophecies and bloodline revelations and has become a character who was always fated to be special.\n\n>He still had no talent as a Shinobi\n\nOriginally. Like I already said, the talentless guy works hard and makes a name for himself thing was clearly how the manga was originally going but then Kishimoto added all this prophecy and bloodline stuff and now Naruto is someone who was destined to be great from the start. \n\nIt lessens Naruto\u2019s previous achievements because it changed it from just a nobody who accomplished them to chosen one who was born to powerful parents and the literal reincarnation of a legend accomplished them. It changed it from a talentless nobody to a legend baby.",

That Minato was a great ninja doesn\u2019t matter. His genetics didn\u2019t help Naruto at all.\n\nYou are aware that Kurama was a net negative through most of Naruto\u2019s life right? He fucked with Naruto\u2019s control, most of Naruto\u2019s chakra was set in maintaining the seal etc. We literally see what Naruto would\u2019ve been without Kurama during Naruto vs Kurama and Naruto + Tobirama vs Obito. He was literally capable of kicking Kurama\u2019s ass solo with just Sage Mode and doing the most damage to Obito and fighting on the level of Tobirama fucking Senju with just Sage Mode. \n\nHagoromo didn\u2019t give Naruto Ashura\u2019s power. He gave him HIS power. Hamura showed by giving his chakra to Hinata that it can go to anyone. As  did Obito with Kakashi. It wasn\u2019t Ashura\u2019s POWER he felt, it was his presence. Naruto is NOT Ashura\u2019s reincarnation. That\u2019s a mistranslation. The correct word is \u201cTransmigrant\u201d. Spiritual successor, heir. These words are closer to the truth, which is why, you know, Hashirama and Naruto and Sasuke and Madara can exist concurrently.\n\nYou aren\u2019t understanding the fundamental facts here. EVERYONE in the series got a lucky break in one way or another. It was what they did with it that mattered",

He was cursed with the nine tails and hated by the village. He suffered just like Neiji did, but unlike Neiji he used the source of his suffering to his advantage. Neiji did not understand what Naruto was truly going through or what he overcame, so Neiji ended up being wrong on multiple fronts.\n\n(and also there was the bit about Naruto mastering shadow clone despite sucking at regular clones, which does unambiguously disprove Neiji's perception of Naruto, but w/e)",

Thanks for commenting! \n\nI just wrote a lot about this on another post so I'm going to keep this a little short and specifically in context with Neji. \n\n- Nejis point is that your birth is important. If you are born a slave like him or a weakling like Hinata or Naruto, you are always that. \n\n- narutos point is that we have the power to change ourselves and choose our paths in life. If Hinata wants to be strong, she can do that. And if Neji wants to be free, he can fight for that freedom instead of settling for slavery. \n\n- if Naruto is just some orphan that has no talent people constantly shit on and then he works hard, tell people to fuck off, and forces them to acknowledge him as a great ninja, then this all makes sense. \n\n- HOWEVER if Naruto has a super special mom and dad, a magical lineage, and is the literal reincarnation of the son of God and the greatest known shinobi(hashirama) then . . . His point is meaningless. Yha maybe HE change the way his life works, but he was born a prince of the ninja world. While Neji was still 100% BORN A SLAVE.  So this whole part becomes a really weird version of a poor but free white person in the US telling a literal slave to simply become free.  It's hollow and kind of gross. \n\n- just a final note, it also takes away the contrast from him and Sasuke. Sasuke had the wild background of a genius and bloodline while Naruto had nothing. Then, they both had to work hard to get stronger. If Naruto has a magic bloodline, which canonically, he does, the Sasuke's line about being more special than Naruto is actually false and it makes sense that Naruto should succeed. Not only did he not lose his family, but he later finds out that he has a loving mother and father AND GETS TO MEET AND SAY GOOD BYE TO THEM! \n\nSo yha, not saying Naruto is bad. Just saying a huge part of his character and the first part of the series makes no sense with his new parentage and background.",

Then of course, Minato sealed Kurama in him, meaning the vast majority of said reserves were used to hold the seal. Thanks Dad. \n\nKakashi taught him fuck all. Certainly less than Dai taught Gai and Gai taught Lee. Jiraiya didn\u2019t give a shit about Naruto until Naruto used Sexy Jutsu to get him to help with Water Walking, during which he impressed Jiraiya by soldiering through despite the seal on him.\n\nNaruto\u2019s heritage literally means fuck all. He still had no talent as a Shinobi and had to make up for that with clever work around a and hard work.\n\nNaruto did NOT inherit Ashura\u2019s power. Ashura was a parasite that attached himself to Naruto and tried to use him to further his own agenda. He was granted power by Hagoromo because Naruto had done so much to create peace and help the Bijuu.\n\nNaruto\u2019s bloodline is irrelevant save for a single thing, which is the Naruto-Sasuke dichotomy. \n\nAs for Guy, he was literally taught to use the Gates, objectively a more powerful and reliable ability than anything Naruto has until he creates Rasenshuriken and learns Sage Mode. He then passed than on to Lee. They were lucky to be born to Dai, and then picked up by Gai respectively. \n\nBesides, Naruto was never about Hard Work vs Talent. That was Lee\u2019s specific theme that because the Gaara vs Lee fight was so damn great became affixed in the minds of the fandom. Naruto\u2019s story was always predominantly about bonds and how they affect someone\u2019s life.

His dad was an elite ninja of the highest caliber, Naruto got great genetics from him. NFL players are super athletically gifted and they pass their genes down to their children who also tend to be super talented. It\u2019s the same thing here.\n\n>Minato sealed Kurama in him\n\nKurama is literally Naruto\u2019s biggest power source. Also another gift given to him not earned (yes it made him a social outcast but power wise Kurama is one of the greatest gifts ever).\n\n>Kakashi taught him fuck all\n\nNaruto couldn\u2019t even hang upside down before Kakashi\u2019s training. \n\n>Jiraiya didn\u2019t give a shit about Naruto until Naruto used sexy justsu \n\nWho cares? Naruto was still taught by one of if not the greatest master in ninja history.\n\n>Naruto\u2019s heritage literally means fuck all\n\nSure, if you ignore that Kushina and Minato are his parents and that he\u2019s the reincarnation of the Sage of Six Path\u2019s son.\n\n>Naruto did NOT inherit Ashura\u2019s power\n\nYes he did he was the only one in the world at the time who could\u2019ve awakened Ashura\u2019s power. Not because he worked for it but because he was born with it, they even make a point about Naruto/Sasuke having always felt that it was there iirc.\n\nAnd no Ashura is not a parasite that attached to Naruto. Naruto *is* Ashura. He\u2019s his reincarnation, they technically are the same person. The same way Avatar Aang and Korra are the same person.\n\n>Naruto\u2019s bloodline is irrelevant\n\nHe literally gets most of his power from it. Even Kurama is technically part of it since he\u2019s inherited from one generation of the Uzumaki clan to the next.\n\n>Naruto was never about Hard Work vs Talent\n\nI partly agree. It wasn\u2019t his main theme but it was one of them. But the whole Neji fight was about fighting your fate (in Naruto\u2019s case it was being a trash ninja who the whole village despised). But then Naruto gets all these prophecies and bloodline revelations and has become a character who was always fated to be special.\n\n>He still had no talent as a Shinobi\n\nOriginally. Like I already said, the talentless guy works hard and makes a name for himself thing was clearly how the manga was originally going but then Kishimoto added all this prophecy and bloodline stuff and now Naruto is someone who was destined to be great from the start. \n\nIt lessens Naruto\u2019s previous achievements because it changed it from just a nobody who accomplished them to chosen one who was born to powerful parents and the literal reincarnation of a legend accomplished them. It changed it from a talentless nobody to a legend baby.",

That Minato was a great ninja doesn\u2019t matter. His genetics didn\u2019t help Naruto at all.\n\nYou are aware that Kurama was a net negative through most of Naruto\u2019s life right? He fucked with Naruto\u2019s control, most of Naruto\u2019s chakra was set in maintaining the seal etc. We literally see what Naruto would\u2019ve been without Kurama during Naruto vs Kurama and Naruto + Tobirama vs Obito. He was literally capable of kicking Kurama\u2019s ass solo with just Sage Mode and doing the most damage to Obito and fighting on the level of Tobirama fucking Senju with just Sage Mode. \n\nHagoromo didn\u2019t give Naruto Ashura\u2019s power. He gave him HIS power. Hamura showed by giving his chakra to Hinata that it can go to anyone. As  did Obito with Kakashi. It wasn\u2019t Ashura\u2019s POWER he felt, it was his presence. Naruto is NOT Ashura\u2019s reincarnation. That\u2019s a mistranslation. The correct word is \u201cTransmigrant\u201d. Spiritual successor, heir. These words are closer to the truth, which is why, you know, Hashirama and Naruto and Sasuke and Madara can exist concurrently.\n\nYou aren\u2019t understanding the fundamental facts here. EVERYONE in the series got a lucky break in one way or another. It was what they did with it that mattered",

Then of course, Minato sealed Kurama in him, meaning the vast majority of said reserves were used to hold the seal. Thanks Dad. \n\nKakashi taught him fuck all.

Ashura was a parasite that attached himself to Naruto and tried to use him to further his own agenda. He was granted power by Hagoromo because Naruto had done so much to create peace and help the Bijuu.\n\nNaruto\u2019s bloodline is irrelevant save for a single thing, which is the Naruto-Sasuke dichotomy. \n\nAs for Guy, he was literally taught to use the Gates, objectively a more powerful and reliable ability than anything Naruto has until he creates Rasenshuriken and learns Sage Mode. He then passed than on to Lee. They were lucky to be born to Dai, and then picked up by Gai respectively. \n\nBesides, Naruto was never about Hard Work vs Talent. That was Lee\u2019s specific theme that because the Gaara vs Lee fight was so damn great became affixed in the minds of the fandom. Naruto\u2019s story was always predominantly about bonds and how they affect someone\u2019s life.

NFL players are super athletically gifted and they pass their genes down to their children who also tend to be super talented. It\u2019s the same thing here.\n\n>Minato sealed Kurama in him\n\nKurama is literally Naruto\u2019s biggest power source. Also another gift given to him not earned (yes it made him a social outcast but power wise Kurama is one of the greatest gifts ever).\n\n>Kakashi taught him fuck all\n\nNaruto couldn\u2019t even hang upside down before Kakashi\u2019s training. \n\n>Jiraiya didn\u2019t give a shit about Naruto until Naruto used sexy justsu \n\nWho cares? Naruto was still taught by one of if not the greatest master in ninja history.\n\n>Naruto\u2019s heritage literally means fuck all\n\nSure, if you ignore that Kushina and Minato are his parents and that he\u2019s the reincarnation of the Sage of Six Path\u2019s son.\n\n>Naruto did NOT inherit Ashura\u2019s power\n\nYes he did he was the only one in the world at the time who could\u2019ve awakened Ashura\u2019s power. Not because he worked for it but because he was born with it, they even make a point about Naruto/Sasuke having always felt that it was there iirc.\n\nAnd no Ashura is not a parasite that attached to Naruto. Naruto *is* Ashura. He\u2019s his reincarnation, they technically are the same person. The same way Avatar Aang and Korra are the same person.\n\n>Naruto\u2019s bloodline is irrelevant\n\nHe literally gets most of his power from it. Even Kurama is technically part of it since he\u2019s inherited from one generation of the Uzumaki clan to the next.\n\n>Naruto was never about Hard Work vs Talent\n\nI partly agree. It wasn\u2019t his main theme but it was one of them. But the whole Neji fight was about fighting your fate (in Naruto\u2019s case it was being a trash ninja who the whole village despised). But then Naruto gets all these prophecies and bloodline revelations and has become a character who was always fated to be special.\n\n>He still had no talent as a Shinobi\n\nOriginally. Like I already said, the talentless guy works hard and makes a name for himself thing was clearly how the manga was originally going but then Kishimoto added all this prophecy and bloodline stuff and now Naruto is someone who was destined to be great from the start. \n\nIt lessens Naruto\u2019s previous achievements because it changed it from just a nobody who accomplished them to chosen one who was born to powerful parents and the literal reincarnation of a legend accomplished them. It changed it from a talentless nobody to a legend baby.",

That Minato was a great ninja doesn\u2019t matter. His genetics didn\u2019t help Naruto at all.\n\nYou are aware that Kurama was a net negative through most of Naruto\u2019s life right? He fucked with Naruto\u2019s control, most of Naruto\u2019s chakra was set in maintaining the seal etc. We literally see what Naruto would\u2019ve been without Kurama during Naruto vs Kurama and Naruto + Tobirama vs Obito. He was literally capable of kicking Kurama\u2019s ass solo with just Sage Mode and doing the most damage to Obito and fighting on the level of Tobirama fucking Senju with just Sage Mode. \n\nHagoromo didn\u2019t give Naruto Ashura\u2019s power. He gave him HIS power. Hamura showed by giving his chakra to Hinata that it can go to anyone. As  did Obito with Kakashi. It wasn\u2019t Ashura\u2019s POWER he felt, it was his presence. Naruto is NOT Ashura\u2019s reincarnation. That\u2019s a mistranslation. The correct word is \u201cTransmigrant\u201d. Spiritual successor, heir. These words are closer to the truth, which is why, you know, Hashirama and Naruto and Sasuke and Madara can exist concurrently.\n\nYou aren\u2019t understanding the fundamental facts here. EVERYONE in the series got a lucky break in one way or another. It was what they did with it that mattered",

Did it give him more chakra? Talent? A Kekkei Genkai? No? Could it then be, that it means fuck all?\n\nAs for chakra reserves, sure. He did inherit large reserves from Kushina. Then of course, Minato sealed Kurama in him, meaning the vast majority of said reserves were used to hold the seal. Thanks Dad. \n\nKakashi taught him fuck all. Certainly less than Dai taught Gai and Gai taught Lee. Jiraiya didn\u2019t give a shit about Naruto until Naruto used Sexy Jutsu to get him to help with Water Walking, during which he impressed Jiraiya by soldiering through despite the seal on him.\n\nNaruto\u2019s heritage literally means fuck all. He still had no talent as a Shinobi and had to make up for that with clever work around a and hard work.\n\nNaruto did NOT inherit Ashura\u2019s power. Ashura was a parasite that attached himself to Naruto and tried to use him to further his own agenda. He was granted power by Hagoromo because Naruto had done so much to create peace and help the Bijuu.\n\nNaruto\u2019s bloodline is irrelevant save for a single thing, which is the Naruto-Sasuke dichotomy. \n\nAs for Guy, he was literally taught to use the Gates, objectively a more powerful and reliable ability than anything Naruto has until he creates Rasenshuriken and learns Sage Mode. He then passed than on to Lee. They were lucky to be born to Dai, and then picked up by Gai respectively. \n\nBesides, Naruto was never about Hard Work vs Talent. That was Lee\u2019s specific theme that because the Gaara vs Lee fight was so damn great became affixed in the minds of the fandom. Naruto\u2019s story was always predominantly about bonds and how they affect someone\u2019s life. Hence why during VOTE2\u2019s final clash, we don\u2019t get a highlight reel of their training, we see the hands of those who they are bonded with supporting them.",

His dad was an elite ninja of the highest caliber, Naruto got great genetics from him. NFL players are super athletically gifted and they pass their genes down to their children who also tend to be super talented. It\u2019s the same thing here.\n\n>Minato sealed Kurama in him\n\nKurama is literally Naruto\u2019s biggest power source. Also another gift given to him not earned (yes it made him a social outcast but power wise Kurama is one of the greatest gifts ever).\n\n>Kakashi taught him fuck all\n\nNaruto couldn\u2019t even hang upside down before Kakashi\u2019s training. \n\n>Jiraiya didn\u2019t give a shit about Naruto until Naruto used sexy justsu \n\nWho cares? Naruto was still taught by one of if not the greatest master in ninja history.\n\n>Naruto\u2019s heritage literally means fuck all\n\nSure, if you ignore that Kushina and Minato are his parents and that he\u2019s the reincarnation of the Sage of Six Path\u2019s son.\n\n>Naruto did NOT inherit Ashura\u2019s power\n\nYes he did he was the only one in the world at the time who could\u2019ve awakened Ashura\u2019s power. Not because he worked for it but because he was born with it, they even make a point about Naruto/Sasuke having always felt that it was there iirc.\n\nAnd no Ashura is not a parasite that attached to Naruto. Naruto *is* Ashura. He\u2019s his reincarnation, they technically are the same person. The same way Avatar Aang and Korra are the same person.\n\n>Naruto\u2019s bloodline is irrelevant\n\nHe literally gets most of his power from it. Even Kurama is technically part of it since he\u2019s inherited from one generation of the Uzumaki clan to the next.\n\n>Naruto was never about Hard Work vs Talent\n\nI partly agree. It wasn\u2019t his main theme but it was one of them. But the whole Neji fight was about fighting your fate (in Naruto\u2019s case it was being a trash ninja who the whole village despised). But then Naruto gets all these prophecies and bloodline revelations and has become a character who was always fated to be special.\n\n>He still had no talent as a Shinobi\n\nOriginally. Like I already said, the talentless guy works hard and makes a name for himself thing was clearly how the manga was originally going but then Kishimoto added all this prophecy and bloodline stuff and now Naruto is someone who was destined to be great from the start. \n\nIt lessens Naruto\u2019s previous achievements because it changed it from just a nobody who accomplished them to chosen one who was born to powerful parents and the literal reincarnation of a legend accomplished them. It changed it from a talentless nobody to a legend baby.",

He was literally capable of kicking Kurama\u2019s ass solo with just Sage Mode and doing the most damage to Obito and fighting on the level of Tobirama fucking Senju with just Sage Mode. \n\nHagoromo didn\u2019t give Naruto Ashura\u2019s power.

When Sasuke begins using Susano\u2019o, Karin notes that she feels a \u201cdark and powerful chakra\u201d in the Susano\u2019o, separate from Sasuke\u2019s own that she\u2019d never felt before.\n\nShe then later felt what she described as an \u201calmost identical\u201d chakra in Naruto. Karin\u2019s skill as a sensor was so good she was able to detect Ashura and Indra and she very clearly indicated that it wasn\u2019t until after Sasuke killed Itachi that he was possessed by Indra",

Talent? A Kekkei Genkai? No? Could it then be, that it means fuck all?\n\nAs for chakra reserves, sure. He did inherit large reserves from Kushina. Then of course, Minato sealed Kurama in him, meaning the vast majority of said reserves were used to hold the seal. Thanks Dad. \n\nKakashi taught him fuck all. Certainly less than Dai taught Gai and Gai taught Lee. Jiraiya didn\u2019t give a shit about Naruto until Naruto used Sexy Jutsu to get him to help with Water Walking, during which he impressed Jiraiya by soldiering through despite the seal on him.\n\nNaruto\u2019s heritage literally means fuck all. He still had no talent as a Shinobi and had to make up for that with clever work around a and hard work.\n\nNaruto did NOT inherit Ashura\u2019s power. Ashura was a parasite that attached himself to Naruto and tried to use him to further his own agenda. He was granted power by Hagoromo because Naruto had done so much to create peace and help the Bijuu.\n\nNaruto\u2019s bloodline is irrelevant save for a single thing, which is the Naruto-Sasuke dichotomy. \n\nAs for Guy, he was literally taught to use the Gates, objectively a more powerful and reliable ability than anything Naruto has until he creates Rasenshuriken and learns Sage Mode. He then passed than on to Lee. They were lucky to be born to Dai, and then picked up by Gai respectively. \n\nBesides, Naruto was never about Hard Work vs Talent. That was Lee\u2019s specific theme that because the Gaara vs Lee fight was so damn great became affixed in the minds of the fandom. Naruto\u2019s story was always predominantly about bonds and how they affect someone\u2019s life. Hence why during VOTE2\u2019s final clash, we don\u2019t get a highlight reel of their training, we see the hands of those who they are bonded with supporting them.",

His dad was an elite ninja of the highest caliber, Naruto got great genetics from him. NFL players are super athletically gifted and they pass their genes down to their children who also tend to be super talented. It\u2019s the same thing here.\n\n>Minato sealed Kurama in him\n\nKurama is literally Naruto\u2019s biggest power source. Also another gift given to him not earned (yes it made him a social outcast but power wise Kurama is one of the greatest gifts ever).\n\n>Kakashi taught him fuck all\n\nNaruto couldn\u2019t even hang upside down before Kakashi\u2019s training. \n\n>Jiraiya didn\u2019t give a shit about Naruto until Naruto used sexy justsu \n\nWho cares? Naruto was still taught by one of if not the greatest master in ninja history.\n\n>Naruto\u2019s heritage literally means fuck all\n\nSure, if you ignore that Kushina and Minato are his parents and that he\u2019s the reincarnation of the Sage of Six Path\u2019s son.\n\n>Naruto did NOT inherit Ashura\u2019s power\n\nYes he did he was the only one in the world at the time who could\u2019ve awakened Ashura\u2019s power. Not because he worked for it but because he was born with it, they even make a point about Naruto/Sasuke having always felt that it was there iirc.\n\nAnd no Ashura is not a parasite that attached to Naruto. Naruto *is* Ashura. He\u2019s his reincarnation, they technically are the same person. The same way Avatar Aang and Korra are the same person.\n\n>Naruto\u2019s bloodline is irrelevant\n\nHe literally gets most of his power from it. Even Kurama is technically part of it since he\u2019s inherited from one generation of the Uzumaki clan to the next.\n\n>Naruto was never about Hard Work vs Talent\n\nI partly agree. It wasn\u2019t his main theme but it was one of them. But the whole Neji fight was about fighting your fate (in Naruto\u2019s case it was being a trash ninja who the whole village despised). But then Naruto gets all these prophecies and bloodline revelations and has become a character who was always fated to be special.\n\n>He still had no talent as a Shinobi\n\nOriginally. Like I already said, the talentless guy works hard and makes a name for himself thing was clearly how the manga was originally going but then Kishimoto added all this prophecy and bloodline stuff and now Naruto is someone who was destined to be great from the start. \n\nIt lessens Naruto\u2019s previous achievements because it changed it from just a nobody who accomplished them to chosen one who was born to powerful parents and the literal reincarnation of a legend accomplished them. It changed it from a talentless nobody to a legend baby.",

He was literally capable of kicking Kurama\u2019s ass solo with just Sage Mode and doing the most damage to Obito and fighting on the level of Tobirama fucking Senju with just Sage Mode. \n\nHagoromo didn\u2019t give Naruto Ashura\u2019s power.

Then of course, Minato sealed Kurama in him, meaning the vast majority of said reserves were used to hold the seal. Thanks Dad. \n\nKakashi taught him fuck all.

He still had no talent as a Shinobi and had to make up for that with clever work around a and hard work.\n\nNaruto did NOT inherit Ashura\u2019s power. Ashura was a parasite that attached himself to Naruto and tried to use him to further his own agenda. He was granted power by Hagoromo because Naruto had done so much to create peace and help the Bijuu.\n\nNaruto\u2019s bloodline is irrelevant save for a single thing, which is the Naruto-Sasuke dichotomy. \n\nAs for Guy, he was literally taught to use the Gates, objectively a more powerful and reliable ability than anything Naruto has until he creates Rasenshuriken and learns Sage Mode. He then passed than on to Lee. They were lucky to be born to Dai, and then picked up by Gai respectively. \n\nBesides, Naruto was never about Hard Work vs Talent. That was Lee\u2019s specific theme that because the Gaara vs Lee fight was so damn great became affixed in the minds of the fandom. Naruto\u2019s story was always predominantly about bonds and how they affect someone\u2019s life. Hence why during VOTE2\u2019s final clash, we don\u2019t get a highlight reel of their training, we see the hands of those who they are bonded with supporting them.",

It\u2019s the same thing here.\n\n>Minato sealed Kurama in him\n\nKurama is literally Naruto\u2019s biggest power source. Also another gift given to him not earned (yes it made him a social outcast but power wise Kurama is one of the greatest gifts ever).\n\n>Kakashi taught him fuck all\n\nNaruto couldn\u2019t even hang upside down before Kakashi\u2019s training. \n\n>Jiraiya didn\u2019t give a shit about Naruto until Naruto used sexy justsu \n\nWho cares? Naruto was still taught by one of if not the greatest master in ninja history.\n\n>Naruto\u2019s heritage literally means fuck all\n\nSure, if you ignore that Kushina and Minato are his parents and that he\u2019s the reincarnation of the Sage of Six Path\u2019s son.\n\n>Naruto did NOT inherit Ashura\u2019s power\n\nYes he did he was the only one in the world at the time who could\u2019ve awakened Ashura\u2019s power. Not because he worked for it but because he was born with it, they even make a point about Naruto/Sasuke having always felt that it was there iirc.\n\nAnd no Ashura is not a parasite that attached to Naruto. Naruto *is* Ashura. He\u2019s his reincarnation, they technically are the same person. The same way Avatar Aang and Korra are the same person.\n\n>Naruto\u2019s bloodline is irrelevant\n\nHe literally gets most of his power from it. Even Kurama is technically part of it since he\u2019s inherited from one generation of the Uzumaki clan to the next.\n\n>Naruto was never about Hard Work vs Talent\n\nI partly agree. It wasn\u2019t his main theme but it was one of them. But the whole Neji fight was about fighting your fate (in Naruto\u2019s case it was being a trash ninja who the whole village despised). But then Naruto gets all these prophecies and bloodline revelations and has become a character who was always fated to be special.\n\n>He still had no talent as a Shinobi\n\nOriginally. Like I already said, the talentless guy works hard and makes a name for himself thing was clearly how the manga was originally going but then Kishimoto added all this prophecy and bloodline stuff and now Naruto is someone who was destined to be great from the start. \n\nIt lessens Naruto\u2019s previous achievements because it changed it from just a nobody who accomplished them to chosen one who was born to powerful parents and the literal reincarnation of a legend accomplished them. It changed it from a talentless nobody to a legend baby.",

His genetics didn\u2019t help Naruto at all.\n\nYou are aware that Kurama was a net negative through most of Naruto\u2019s life right? He fucked with Naruto\u2019s control, most of Naruto\u2019s chakra was set in maintaining the seal etc. We literally see what Naruto would\u2019ve been without Kurama during Naruto vs Kurama and Naruto + Tobirama vs Obito. He was literally capable of kicking Kurama\u2019s ass solo with just Sage Mode and doing the most damage to Obito and fighting on the level of Tobirama fucking Senju with just Sage Mode. \n\nHagoromo didn\u2019t give Naruto Ashura\u2019s power. He gave him HIS power. Hamura showed by giving his chakra to Hinata that it can go to anyone. As  did Obito with Kakashi. It wasn\u2019t Ashura\u2019s POWER he felt, it was his presence. Naruto is NOT Ashura\u2019s reincarnation. That\u2019s a mistranslation. The correct word is \u201cTransmigrant\u201d. Spiritual successor, heir. These words are closer to the truth, which is why, you know, Hashirama and Naruto and Sasuke and Madara can exist concurrently.\n\nYou aren\u2019t understanding the fundamental facts here. EVERYONE in the series got a lucky break in one way or another. It was what they did with it that mattered",

A Kekkei Genkai? No? Could it then be, that it means fuck all?\n\nAs for chakra reserves, sure. He did inherit large reserves from Kushina. Then of course, Minato sealed Kurama in him, meaning the vast majority of said reserves were used to hold the seal. Thanks Dad. \n\nKakashi taught him fuck all. Certainly less than Dai taught Gai and Gai taught Lee. Jiraiya didn\u2019t give a shit about Naruto until Naruto used Sexy Jutsu to get him to help with Water Walking, during which he impressed Jiraiya by soldiering through despite the seal on him.\n\nNaruto\u2019s heritage literally means fuck all. He still had no talent as a Shinobi and had to make up for that with clever work around a and hard work.\n\nNaruto did NOT inherit Ashura\u2019s power. Ashura was a parasite that attached himself to Naruto and tried to use him to further his own agenda. He was granted power by Hagoromo because Naruto had done so much to create peace and help the Bijuu.\n\nNaruto\u2019s bloodline is irrelevant save for a single thing, which is the Naruto-Sasuke dichotomy. \n\nAs for Guy, he was literally taught to use the Gates, objectively a more powerful and reliable ability than anything Naruto has until he creates Rasenshuriken and learns Sage Mode. He then passed than on to Lee. They were lucky to be born to Dai, and then picked up by Gai respectively. \n\nBesides, Naruto was never about Hard Work vs Talent. That was Lee\u2019s specific theme that because the Gaara vs Lee fight was so damn great became affixed in the minds of the fandom. Naruto\u2019s story was always predominantly about bonds and how they affect someone\u2019s life. Hence why during VOTE2\u2019s final clash, we don\u2019t get a highlight reel of their training, we see the hands of those who they are bonded with supporting them.",

His dad was an elite ninja of the highest caliber, Naruto got great genetics from him. NFL players are super athletically gifted and they pass their genes down to their children who also tend to be super talented. It\u2019s the same thing here.\n\n>Minato sealed Kurama in him\n\nKurama is literally Naruto\u2019s biggest power source. Also another gift given to him not earned (yes it made him a social outcast but power wise Kurama is one of the greatest gifts ever).\n\n>Kakashi taught him fuck all\n\nNaruto couldn\u2019t even hang upside down before Kakashi\u2019s training. \n\n>Jiraiya didn\u2019t give a shit about Naruto until Naruto used sexy justsu \n\nWho cares? Naruto was still taught by one of if not the greatest master in ninja history.\n\n>Naruto\u2019s heritage literally means fuck all\n\nSure, if you ignore that Kushina and Minato are his parents and that he\u2019s the reincarnation of the Sage of Six Path\u2019s son.\n\n>Naruto did NOT inherit Ashura\u2019s power\n\nYes he did he was the only one in the world at the time who could\u2019ve awakened Ashura\u2019s power. Not because he worked for it but because he was born with it, they even make a point about Naruto/Sasuke having always felt that it was there iirc.\n\nAnd no Ashura is not a parasite that attached to Naruto. Naruto *is* Ashura. He\u2019s his reincarnation, they technically are the same person. The same way Avatar Aang and Korra are the same person.\n\n>Naruto\u2019s bloodline is irrelevant\n\nHe literally gets most of his power from it. Even Kurama is technically part of it since he\u2019s inherited from one generation of the Uzumaki clan to the next.\n\n>Naruto was never about Hard Work vs Talent\n\nI partly agree. It wasn\u2019t his main theme but it was one of them. But the whole Neji fight was about fighting your fate (in Naruto\u2019s case it was being a trash ninja who the whole village despised). But then Naruto gets all these prophecies and bloodline revelations and has become a character who was always fated to be special.\n\n>He still had no talent as a Shinobi\n\nOriginally. Like I already said, the talentless guy works hard and makes a name for himself thing was clearly how the manga was originally going but then Kishimoto added all this prophecy and bloodline stuff and now Naruto is someone who was destined to be great from the start. \n\nIt lessens Naruto\u2019s previous achievements because it changed it from just a nobody who accomplished them to chosen one who was born to powerful parents and the literal reincarnation of a legend accomplished them. It changed it from a talentless nobody to a legend baby.",

He was literally capable of kicking Kurama\u2019s ass solo with just Sage Mode and doing the most damage to Obito and fighting on the level of Tobirama fucking Senju with just Sage Mode. \n\nHagoromo didn\u2019t give Naruto Ashura\u2019s power. He gave him HIS power. Hamura showed by giving his chakra to Hinata that it can go to anyone. As  did Obito with Kakashi. It wasn\u2019t Ashura\u2019s POWER he felt, it was his presence. Naruto is NOT Ashura\u2019s reincarnation. That\u2019s a mistranslation. The correct word is \u201cTransmigrant\u201d. Spiritual successor, heir. These words are closer to the truth, which is why, you know, Hashirama and Naruto and Sasuke and Madara can exist concurrently.\n\nYou aren\u2019t understanding the fundamental facts here.

Could it then be, that it means fuck all?\n\nAs for chakra reserves, sure. He did inherit large reserves from Kushina. Then of course, Minato sealed Kurama in him, meaning the vast majority of said reserves were used to hold the seal. Thanks Dad. \n\nKakashi taught him fuck all. Certainly less than Dai taught Gai and Gai taught Lee. Jiraiya didn\u2019t give a shit about Naruto until Naruto used Sexy Jutsu to get him to help with Water Walking, during which he impressed Jiraiya by soldiering through despite the seal on him.\n\nNaruto\u2019s heritage literally means fuck all. He still had no talent as a Shinobi and had to make up for that with clever work around a and hard work.\n\nNaruto did NOT inherit Ashura\u2019s power. Ashura was a parasite that attached himself to Naruto and tried to use him to further his own agenda. He was granted power by Hagoromo because Naruto had done so much to create peace and help the Bijuu.\n\nNaruto\u2019s bloodline is irrelevant save for a single thing, which is the Naruto-Sasuke dichotomy. \n\nAs for Guy, he was literally taught to use the Gates, objectively a more powerful and reliable ability than anything Naruto has until he creates Rasenshuriken and learns Sage Mode. He then passed than on to Lee. They were lucky to be born to Dai, and then picked up by Gai respectively. \n\nBesides, Naruto was never about Hard Work vs Talent. That was Lee\u2019s specific theme that because the Gaara vs Lee fight was so damn great became affixed in the minds of the fandom. Naruto\u2019s story was always predominantly about bonds and how they affect someone\u2019s life. Hence why during VOTE2\u2019s final clash, we don\u2019t get a highlight reel of their training, we see the hands of those who they are bonded with supporting them.",

His dad was an elite ninja of the highest caliber, Naruto got great genetics from him. NFL players are super athletically gifted and they pass their genes down to their children who also tend to be super talented. It\u2019s the same thing here.\n\n>Minato sealed Kurama in him\n\nKurama is literally Naruto\u2019s biggest power source. Also another gift given to him not earned (yes it made him a social outcast but power wise Kurama is one of the greatest gifts ever).\n\n>Kakashi taught him fuck all\n\nNaruto couldn\u2019t even hang upside down before Kakashi\u2019s training. \n\n>Jiraiya didn\u2019t give a shit about Naruto until Naruto used sexy justsu \n\nWho cares? Naruto was still taught by one of if not the greatest master in ninja history.\n\n>Naruto\u2019s heritage literally means fuck all\n\nSure, if you ignore that Kushina and Minato are his parents and that he\u2019s the reincarnation of the Sage of Six Path\u2019s son.\n\n>Naruto did NOT inherit Ashura\u2019s power\n\nYes he did he was the only one in the world at the time who could\u2019ve awakened Ashura\u2019s power. Not because he worked for it but because he was born with it, they even make a point about Naruto/Sasuke having always felt that it was there iirc.\n\nAnd no Ashura is not a parasite that attached to Naruto. Naruto *is* Ashura. He\u2019s his reincarnation, they technically are the same person. The same way Avatar Aang and Korra are the same person.\n\n>Naruto\u2019s bloodline is irrelevant\n\nHe literally gets most of his power from it. Even Kurama is technically part of it since he\u2019s inherited from one generation of the Uzumaki clan to the next.\n\n>Naruto was never about Hard Work vs Talent\n\nI partly agree. It wasn\u2019t his main theme but it was one of them. But the whole Neji fight was about fighting your fate (in Naruto\u2019s case it was being a trash ninja who the whole village despised). But then Naruto gets all these prophecies and bloodline revelations and has become a character who was always fated to be special.\n\n>He still had no talent as a Shinobi\n\nOriginally. Like I already said, the talentless guy works hard and makes a name for himself thing was clearly how the manga was originally going but then Kishimoto added all this prophecy and bloodline stuff and now Naruto is someone who was destined to be great from the start. \n\nIt lessens Naruto\u2019s previous achievements because it changed it from just a nobody who accomplished them to chosen one who was born to powerful parents and the literal reincarnation of a legend accomplished them. It changed it from a talentless nobody to a legend baby.",

He fucked with Naruto\u2019s control, most of Naruto\u2019s chakra was set in maintaining the seal etc. We literally see what Naruto would\u2019ve been without Kurama during Naruto vs Kurama and Naruto + Tobirama vs Obito. He was literally capable of kicking Kurama\u2019s ass solo with just Sage Mode and doing the most damage to Obito and fighting on the level of Tobirama fucking Senju with just Sage Mode. \n\nHagoromo didn\u2019t give Naruto Ashura\u2019s power. He gave him HIS power. Hamura showed by giving his chakra to Hinata that it can go to anyone. As  did Obito with Kakashi. It wasn\u2019t Ashura\u2019s POWER he felt, it was his presence. Naruto is NOT Ashura\u2019s reincarnation. That\u2019s a mistranslation. The correct word is \u201cTransmigrant\u201d. Spiritual successor, heir. These words are closer to the truth, which is why, you know, Hashirama and Naruto and Sasuke and Madara can exist concurrently.\n\nYou aren\u2019t understanding the fundamental facts here.

Could it then be, that it means fuck all?\n\nAs for chakra reserves, sure. He did inherit large reserves from Kushina. Then of course, Minato sealed Kurama in him, meaning the vast majority of said reserves were used to hold the seal. Thanks Dad. \n\nKakashi taught him fuck all. Certainly less than Dai taught Gai and Gai taught Lee. Jiraiya didn\u2019t give a shit about Naruto until Naruto used Sexy Jutsu to get him to help with Water Walking, during which he impressed Jiraiya by soldiering through despite the seal on him.\n\nNaruto\u2019s heritage literally means fuck all. He still had no talent as a Shinobi and had to make up for that with clever work around a and hard work.\n\nNaruto did NOT inherit Ashura\u2019s power. Ashura was a parasite that attached himself to Naruto and tried to use him to further his own agenda. He was granted power by Hagoromo because Naruto had done so much to create peace and help the Bijuu.\n\nNaruto\u2019s bloodline is irrelevant save for a single thing, which is the Naruto-Sasuke dichotomy. \n\nAs for Guy, he was literally taught to use the Gates, objectively a more powerful and reliable ability than anything Naruto has until he creates Rasenshuriken and learns Sage Mode. He then passed than on to Lee. They were lucky to be born to Dai, and then picked up by Gai respectively. \n\nBesides, Naruto was never about Hard Work vs Talent. That was Lee\u2019s specific theme that because the Gaara vs Lee fight was so damn great became affixed in the minds of the fandom. Naruto\u2019s story was always predominantly about bonds and how they affect someone\u2019s life. Hence why during VOTE2\u2019s final clash, we don\u2019t get a highlight reel of their training, we see the hands of those who they are bonded with supporting them.",

Not because he worked for it but because he was born with it, they even make a point about Naruto/Sasuke having always felt that it was there iirc.\n\nAnd no Ashura is not a parasite that attached to Naruto. Naruto *is* Ashura. He\u2019s his reincarnation, they technically are the same person. The same way Avatar Aang and Korra are the same person.\n\n>Naruto\u2019s bloodline is irrelevant\n\nHe literally gets most of his power from it. Even Kurama is technically part of it since he\u2019s inherited from one generation of the Uzumaki clan to the next.\n\n>Naruto was never about Hard Work vs Talent\n\nI partly agree. It wasn\u2019t his main theme but it was one of them. But the whole Neji fight was about fighting your fate (in Naruto\u2019s case it was being a trash ninja who the whole village despised). But then Naruto gets all these prophecies and bloodline revelations and has become a character who was always fated to be special.\n\n>He still had no talent as a Shinobi\n\nOriginally. Like I already said, the talentless guy works hard and makes a name for himself thing was clearly how the manga was originally going but then Kishimoto added all this prophecy and bloodline stuff and now Naruto is someone who was destined to be great from the start. \n\nIt lessens Naruto\u2019s previous achievements because it changed it from just a nobody who accomplished them to chosen one who was born to powerful parents and the literal reincarnation of a legend accomplished them. It changed it from a talentless nobody to a legend baby.",

He fucked with Naruto\u2019s control, most of Naruto\u2019s chakra was set in maintaining the seal etc. We literally see what Naruto would\u2019ve been without Kurama during Naruto vs Kurama and Naruto + Tobirama vs Obito. He was literally capable of kicking Kurama\u2019s ass solo with just Sage Mode and doing the most damage to Obito and fighting on the level of Tobirama fucking Senju with just Sage Mode. \n\nHagoromo didn\u2019t give Naruto Ashura\u2019s power. He gave him HIS power. Hamura showed by giving his chakra to Hinata that it can go to anyone. As  did Obito with Kakashi. It wasn\u2019t Ashura\u2019s POWER he felt, it was his presence. Naruto is NOT Ashura\u2019s reincarnation. That\u2019s a mistranslation. The correct word is \u201cTransmigrant\u201d. Spiritual successor, heir. These words are closer to the truth, which is why, you know, Hashirama and Naruto and Sasuke and Madara can exist concurrently.\n\nYou aren\u2019t understanding the fundamental facts here.

Could it then be, that it means fuck all?\n\nAs for chakra reserves, sure. He did inherit large reserves from Kushina. Then of course, Minato sealed Kurama in him, meaning the vast majority of said reserves were used to hold the seal. Thanks Dad. \n\nKakashi taught him fuck all. Certainly less than Dai taught Gai and Gai taught Lee. Jiraiya didn\u2019t give a shit about Naruto until Naruto used Sexy Jutsu to get him to help with Water Walking, during which he impressed Jiraiya by soldiering through despite the seal on him.\n\nNaruto\u2019s heritage literally means fuck all. He still had no talent as a Shinobi and had to make up for that with clever work around a and hard work.\n\nNaruto did NOT inherit Ashura\u2019s power. Ashura was a parasite that attached himself to Naruto and tried to use him to further his own agenda. He was granted power by Hagoromo because Naruto had done so much to create peace and help the Bijuu.\n\nNaruto\u2019s bloodline is irrelevant save for a single thing, which is the Naruto-Sasuke dichotomy. \n\nAs for Guy, he was literally taught to use the Gates, objectively a more powerful and reliable ability than anything Naruto has until he creates Rasenshuriken and learns Sage Mode. He then passed than on to Lee. They were lucky to be born to Dai, and then picked up by Gai respectively. \n\nBesides, Naruto was never about Hard Work vs Talent. That was Lee\u2019s specific theme that because the Gaara vs Lee fight was so damn great became affixed in the minds of the fandom. Naruto\u2019s story was always predominantly about bonds and how they affect someone\u2019s life. Hence why during VOTE2\u2019s final clash, we don\u2019t get a highlight reel of their training, we see the hands of those who they are bonded with supporting them.",

His dad was an elite ninja of the highest caliber, Naruto got great genetics from him. NFL players are super athletically gifted and they pass their genes down to their children who also tend to be super talented. It\u2019s the same thing here.\n\n>Minato sealed Kurama in him\n\nKurama is literally Naruto\u2019s biggest power source. Also another gift given to him not earned (yes it made him a social outcast but power wise Kurama is one of the greatest gifts ever).\n\n>Kakashi taught him fuck all\n\nNaruto couldn\u2019t even hang upside down before Kakashi\u2019s training. \n\n>Jiraiya didn\u2019t give a shit about Naruto until Naruto used sexy justsu \n\nWho cares? Naruto was still taught by one of if not the greatest master in ninja history.\n\n>Naruto\u2019s heritage literally means fuck all\n\nSure, if you ignore that Kushina and Minato are his parents and that he\u2019s the reincarnation of the Sage of Six Path\u2019s son.\n\n>Naruto did NOT inherit Ashura\u2019s power\n\nYes he did he was the only one in the world at the time who could\u2019ve awakened Ashura\u2019s power. Not because he worked for it but because he was born with it, they even make a point about Naruto/Sasuke having always felt that it was there iirc.\n\nAnd no Ashura is not a parasite that attached to Naruto. Naruto *is* Ashura. He\u2019s his reincarnation, they technically are the same person. The same way Avatar Aang and Korra are the same person.\n\n>Naruto\u2019s bloodline is irrelevant\n\nHe literally gets most of his power from it. Even Kurama is technically part of it since he\u2019s inherited from one generation of the Uzumaki clan to the next.\n\n>Naruto was never about Hard Work vs Talent\n\nI partly agree. It wasn\u2019t his main theme but it was one of them. But the whole Neji fight was about fighting your fate (in Naruto\u2019s case it was being a trash ninja who the whole village despised). But then Naruto gets all these prophecies and bloodline revelations and has become a character who was always fated to be special.\n\n>He still had no talent as a Shinobi\n\nOriginally. Like I already said, the talentless guy works hard and makes a name for himself thing was clearly how the manga was originally going but then Kishimoto added all this prophecy and bloodline stuff and now Naruto is someone who was destined to be great from the start. \n\nIt lessens Naruto\u2019s previous achievements because it changed it from just a nobody who accomplished them to chosen one who was born to powerful parents and the literal reincarnation of a legend accomplished them. It changed it from a talentless nobody to a legend baby.",

Then of course, Minato sealed Kurama in him, meaning the vast majority of said reserves were used to hold the seal. Thanks Dad. \n\nKakashi taught him fuck all. Certainly less than Dai taught Gai and Gai taught Lee.

Ashura was a parasite that attached himself to Naruto and tried to use him to further his own agenda. He was granted power by Hagoromo because Naruto had done so much to create peace and help the Bijuu.\n\nNaruto\u2019s bloodline is irrelevant save for a single thing, which is the Naruto-Sasuke dichotomy. \n\nAs for Guy, he was literally taught to use the Gates, objectively a more powerful and reliable ability than anything Naruto has until he creates Rasenshuriken and learns Sage Mode. He then passed than on to Lee. They were lucky to be born to Dai, and then picked up by Gai respectively. \n\nBesides, Naruto was never about Hard Work vs Talent. That was Lee\u2019s specific theme that because the Gaara vs Lee fight was so damn great became affixed in the minds of the fandom. Naruto\u2019s story was always predominantly about bonds and how they affect someone\u2019s life.

NFL players are super athletically gifted and they pass their genes down to their children who also tend to be super talented. It\u2019s the same thing here.\n\n>Minato sealed Kurama in him\n\nKurama is literally Naruto\u2019s biggest power source. Also another gift given to him not earned (yes it made him a social outcast but power wise Kurama is one of the greatest gifts ever).\n\n>Kakashi taught him fuck all\n\nNaruto couldn\u2019t even hang upside down before Kakashi\u2019s training. \n\n>Jiraiya didn\u2019t give a shit about Naruto until Naruto used sexy justsu \n\nWho cares? Naruto was still taught by one of if not the greatest master in ninja history.\n\n>Naruto\u2019s heritage literally means fuck all\n\nSure, if you ignore that Kushina and Minato are his parents and that he\u2019s the reincarnation of the Sage of Six Path\u2019s son.\n\n>Naruto did NOT inherit Ashura\u2019s power\n\nYes he did he was the only one in the world at the time who could\u2019ve awakened Ashura\u2019s power. Not because he worked for it but because he was born with it, they even make a point about Naruto/Sasuke having always felt that it was there iirc.\n\nAnd no Ashura is not a parasite that attached to Naruto. Naruto *is* Ashura. He\u2019s his reincarnation, they technically are the same person. The same way Avatar Aang and Korra are the same person.\n\n>Naruto\u2019s bloodline is irrelevant\n\nHe literally gets most of his power from it. Even Kurama is technically part of it since he\u2019s inherited from one generation of the Uzumaki clan to the next.\n\n>Naruto was never about Hard Work vs Talent\n\nI partly agree. It wasn\u2019t his main theme but it was one of them. But the whole Neji fight was about fighting your fate (in Naruto\u2019s case it was being a trash ninja who the whole village despised). But then Naruto gets all these prophecies and bloodline revelations and has become a character who was always fated to be special.\n\n>He still had no talent as a Shinobi\n\nOriginally. Like I already said, the talentless guy works hard and makes a name for himself thing was clearly how the manga was originally going but then Kishimoto added all this prophecy and bloodline stuff and now Naruto is someone who was destined to be great from the start. \n\nIt lessens Naruto\u2019s previous achievements because it changed it from just a nobody who accomplished them to chosen one who was born to powerful parents and the literal reincarnation of a legend accomplished them. It changed it from a talentless nobody to a legend baby.",

Could it then be, that it means fuck all?\n\nAs for chakra reserves, sure. He did inherit large reserves from Kushina. Then of course, Minato sealed Kurama in him, meaning the vast majority of said reserves were used to hold the seal. Thanks Dad. \n\nKakashi taught him fuck all. Certainly less than Dai taught Gai and Gai taught Lee. Jiraiya didn\u2019t give a shit about Naruto until Naruto used Sexy Jutsu to get him to help with Water Walking, during which he impressed Jiraiya by soldiering through despite the seal on him.\n\nNaruto\u2019s heritage literally means fuck all. He still had no talent as a Shinobi and had to make up for that with clever work around a and hard work.\n\nNaruto did NOT inherit Ashura\u2019s power. Ashura was a parasite that attached himself to Naruto and tried to use him to further his own agenda. He was granted power by Hagoromo because Naruto had done so much to create peace and help the Bijuu.\n\nNaruto\u2019s bloodline is irrelevant save for a single thing, which is the Naruto-Sasuke dichotomy. \n\nAs for Guy, he was literally taught to use the Gates, objectively a more powerful and reliable ability than anything Naruto has until he creates Rasenshuriken and learns Sage Mode. He then passed than on to Lee. They were lucky to be born to Dai, and then picked up by Gai respectively. \n\nBesides, Naruto was never about Hard Work vs Talent. That was Lee\u2019s specific theme that because the Gaara vs Lee fight was so damn great became affixed in the minds of the fandom. Naruto\u2019s story was always predominantly about bonds and how they affect someone\u2019s life. Hence why during VOTE2\u2019s final clash, we don\u2019t get a highlight reel of their training, we see the hands of those who they are bonded with supporting them.",

His dad was an elite ninja of the highest caliber, Naruto got great genetics from him. NFL players are super athletically gifted and they pass their genes down to their children who also tend to be super talented. It\u2019s the same thing here.\n\n>Minato sealed Kurama in him\n\nKurama is literally Naruto\u2019s biggest power source. Also another gift given to him not earned (yes it made him a social outcast but power wise Kurama is one of the greatest gifts ever).\n\n>Kakashi taught him fuck all\n\nNaruto couldn\u2019t even hang upside down before Kakashi\u2019s training. \n\n>Jiraiya didn\u2019t give a shit about Naruto until Naruto used sexy justsu \n\nWho cares? Naruto was still taught by one of if not the greatest master in ninja history.\n\n>Naruto\u2019s heritage literally means fuck all\n\nSure, if you ignore that Kushina and Minato are his parents and that he\u2019s the reincarnation of the Sage of Six Path\u2019s son.\n\n>Naruto did NOT inherit Ashura\u2019s power\n\nYes he did he was the only one in the world at the time who could\u2019ve awakened Ashura\u2019s power. Not because he worked for it but because he was born with it, they even make a point about Naruto/Sasuke having always felt that it was there iirc.\n\nAnd no Ashura is not a parasite that attached to Naruto. Naruto *is* Ashura. He\u2019s his reincarnation, they technically are the same person. The same way Avatar Aang and Korra are the same person.\n\n>Naruto\u2019s bloodline is irrelevant\n\nHe literally gets most of his power from it. Even Kurama is technically part of it since he\u2019s inherited from one generation of the Uzumaki clan to the next.\n\n>Naruto was never about Hard Work vs Talent\n\nI partly agree. It wasn\u2019t his main theme but it was one of them. But the whole Neji fight was about fighting your fate (in Naruto\u2019s case it was being a trash ninja who the whole village despised). But then Naruto gets all these prophecies and bloodline revelations and has become a character who was always fated to be special.\n\n>He still had no talent as a Shinobi\n\nOriginally. Like I already said, the talentless guy works hard and makes a name for himself thing was clearly how the manga was originally going but then Kishimoto added all this prophecy and bloodline stuff and now Naruto is someone who was destined to be great from the start. \n\nIt lessens Naruto\u2019s previous achievements because it changed it from just a nobody who accomplished them to chosen one who was born to powerful parents and the literal reincarnation of a legend accomplished them. It changed it from a talentless nobody to a legend baby.",

Could it then be, that it means fuck all?\n\nAs for chakra reserves, sure. He did inherit large reserves from Kushina. Then of course, Minato sealed Kurama in him, meaning the vast majority of said reserves were used to hold the seal. Thanks Dad. \n\nKakashi taught him fuck all. Certainly less than Dai taught Gai and Gai taught Lee. Jiraiya didn\u2019t give a shit about Naruto until Naruto used Sexy Jutsu to get him to help with Water Walking, during which he impressed Jiraiya by soldiering through despite the seal on him.\n\nNaruto\u2019s heritage literally means fuck all. He still had no talent as a Shinobi and had to make up for that with clever work around a and hard work.\n\nNaruto did NOT inherit Ashura\u2019s power. Ashura was a parasite that attached himself to Naruto and tried to use him to further his own agenda. He was granted power by Hagoromo because Naruto had done so much to create peace and help the Bijuu.\n\nNaruto\u2019s bloodline is irrelevant save for a single thing, which is the Naruto-Sasuke dichotomy. \n\nAs for Guy, he was literally taught to use the Gates, objectively a more powerful and reliable ability than anything Naruto has until he creates Rasenshuriken and learns Sage Mode. He then passed than on to Lee. They were lucky to be born to Dai, and then picked up by Gai respectively. \n\nBesides, Naruto was never about Hard Work vs Talent. That was Lee\u2019s specific theme that because the Gaara vs Lee fight was so damn great became affixed in the minds of the fandom. Naruto\u2019s story was always predominantly about bonds and how they affect someone\u2019s life. Hence why during VOTE2\u2019s final clash, we don\u2019t get a highlight reel of their training, we see the hands of those who they are bonded with supporting them.",

His dad was an elite ninja of the highest caliber, Naruto got great genetics from him. NFL players are super athletically gifted and they pass their genes down to their children who also tend to be super talented. It\u2019s the same thing here.\n\n>Minato sealed Kurama in him\n\nKurama is literally Naruto\u2019s biggest power source. Also another gift given to him not earned (yes it made him a social outcast but power wise Kurama is one of the greatest gifts ever).\n\n>Kakashi taught him fuck all\n\nNaruto couldn\u2019t even hang upside down before Kakashi\u2019s training. \n\n>Jiraiya didn\u2019t give a shit about Naruto until Naruto used sexy justsu \n\nWho cares? Naruto was still taught by one of if not the greatest master in ninja history.\n\n>Naruto\u2019s heritage literally means fuck all\n\nSure, if you ignore that Kushina and Minato are his parents and that he\u2019s the reincarnation of the Sage of Six Path\u2019s son.\n\n>Naruto did NOT inherit Ashura\u2019s power\n\nYes he did he was the only one in the world at the time who could\u2019ve awakened Ashura\u2019s power. Not because he worked for it but because he was born with it, they even make a point about Naruto/Sasuke having always felt that it was there iirc.\n\nAnd no Ashura is not a parasite that attached to Naruto. Naruto *is* Ashura. He\u2019s his reincarnation, they technically are the same person. The same way Avatar Aang and Korra are the same person.\n\n>Naruto\u2019s bloodline is irrelevant\n\nHe literally gets most of his power from it. Even Kurama is technically part of it since he\u2019s inherited from one generation of the Uzumaki clan to the next.\n\n>Naruto was never about Hard Work vs Talent\n\nI partly agree. It wasn\u2019t his main theme but it was one of them. But the whole Neji fight was about fighting your fate (in Naruto\u2019s case it was being a trash ninja who the whole village despised). But then Naruto gets all these prophecies and bloodline revelations and has become a character who was always fated to be special.\n\n>He still had no talent as a Shinobi\n\nOriginally. Like I already said, the talentless guy works hard and makes a name for himself thing was clearly how the manga was originally going but then Kishimoto added all this prophecy and bloodline stuff and now Naruto is someone who was destined to be great from the start. \n\nIt lessens Naruto\u2019s previous achievements because it changed it from just a nobody who accomplished them to chosen one who was born to powerful parents and the literal reincarnation of a legend accomplished them. It changed it from a talentless nobody to a legend baby.",

He was literally capable of kicking Kurama\u2019s ass solo with just Sage Mode and doing the most damage to Obito and fighting on the level of Tobirama fucking Senju with just Sage Mode. \n\nHagoromo didn\u2019t give Naruto Ashura\u2019s power. He gave him HIS power. Hamura showed by giving his chakra to Hinata that it can go to anyone. As  did Obito with Kakashi. It wasn\u2019t Ashura\u2019s POWER he felt, it was his presence. Naruto is NOT Ashura\u2019s reincarnation. That\u2019s a mistranslation. The correct word is \u201cTransmigrant\u201d. Spiritual successor, heir. These words are closer to the truth, which is why, you know, Hashirama and Naruto and Sasuke and Madara can exist concurrently.\n\nYou aren\u2019t understanding the fundamental facts here. EVERYONE in the series got a lucky break in one way or another. It was what they did with it that mattered",

            "body": ">what does \u201c4th hokage genetics\u201d give Naruto?\n\nTalent obviously. His dad was an elite ninja of the highest caliber, Naruto got great genetics from him. NFL players are super athletically gifted and they pass their genes down to their children who also tend to be super talented. It\u2019s the same thing here.\n\n>Minato sealed Kurama in him\n\nKurama is literally Naruto\u2019s biggest power source. Also another gift given to him not earned (yes it made him a social outcast but power wise Kurama is one of the greatest gifts ever).\n\n>Kakashi taught him fuck all\n\nNaruto couldn\u2019t even hang upside down before Kakashi\u2019s training. \n\n>Jiraiya didn\u2019t give a shit about Naruto until Naruto used sexy justsu \n\nWho cares? Naruto was still taught by one of if not the greatest master in ninja history.\n\n>Naruto\u2019s heritage literally means fuck all\n\nSure, if you ignore that Kushina and Minato are his parents and that he\u2019s the reincarnation of the Sage of Six Path\u2019s son.\n\n>Naruto did NOT inherit Ashura\u2019s power\n\nYes he did he was the only one in the world at the time who could\u2019ve awakened Ashura\u2019s power. Not because he worked for it but because he was born with it, they even make a point about Naruto/Sasuke having always felt that it was there iirc.\n\nAnd no Ashura is not a parasite that attached to Naruto. Naruto *is* Ashura. He\u2019s his reincarnation, they technically are the same person. The same way Avatar Aang and Korra are the same person.\n\n>Naruto\u2019s bloodline is irrelevant\n\nHe literally gets most of his power from it. Even Kurama is technically part of it since he\u2019s inherited from one generation of the Uzumaki clan to the next.\n\n>Naruto was never about Hard Work vs Talent\n\nI partly agree. It wasn\u2019t his main theme but it was one of them. But the whole Neji fight was about fighting your fate (in Naruto\u2019s case it was being a trash ninja who the whole village despised). But then Naruto gets all these prophecies and bloodline revelations and has become a character who was always fated to be special.\n\n>He still had no talent as a Shinobi\n\nOriginally. Like I already said, the talentless guy works hard and makes a name for himself thing was clearly how the manga was originally going but then Kishimoto added all this prophecy and bloodline stuff and now Naruto is someone who was destined to be great from the start. \n\nIt lessens Naruto\u2019s previous achievements because it changed it from just a nobody who accomplished them to chosen one who was born to powerful parents and the literal reincarnation of a legend accomplished them. It changed it from a talentless nobody to a legend baby.",
