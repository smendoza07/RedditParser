That kind of relationship can get real sour.  IMHO, this type of arrangement/relationship is supposed to be an entertaining distraction for two people with busy lives.\n\nMy general rules:\n\n1.  Send a message and don't ever send a follow up that day (ie.  You there???).  The person isn't an idiot and if they are, why are you talking to them?  They got the message.  If they don't respond, they are either busy or not interested.  \n2. If they don't respond in 24 hours, they probably aren't interested.  If you have spoken to a person a lot, maybe give one polite follow up (Hey.  How are things going?) to see if its over or they are just buried.\n3. If you don't start talking about meeting within a few days of the first contact, you never will.  There is no point in going back and forth forever.  Its been my experience that if things aren't going well and progressing towards a M&G pretty quickly, you are both wasting your time.",

But you go and interpret it as *I'm not the most important thing to her right now :(* I'm sure you can see how that is oversensitive considering that this is somebody who doesn't even really know you.\n\nLike I just told, some things sell out quickly so 'Black Friday sales last all weekend' doesn't apply. You do seem fairly neurotic but I can accept that it's likely a generational thing and not being able to understand or relate to younger people. Chalk it up to generational miscommunication but you did seriously overreact and were infinitely more immature in your response.",

However, expecting them to say \"I\"m busy, ttyl\" or something similar when they are busy is not.\n\nI've come to the conclusion that most people aren't very considerate, so if a SB doesn't text me back, or give me a little heads up that she will be away, I assume that she just doesn't really care. I don't mention it and I just continue my search for other SBs.\n\nEdit: To further elaborate: I try to give people my full attention when I'm talking to them. If I can't, I tell them I'm busy. Especially when we have just meet them. First impressions guide all further impressions.\n\nIn the past I expected that same treatment. However I realized many people treat all conversations like Candy Crush. They play for a few moments, then drop it when something more interesting comes up.\n\nWhile I agree, that if a person vanishes it is silly to blow up, I can understand why they would be annoyed.",

Sometimes someone would say *I've got to run for now I'll call back later. I think it's terribly rude tto just stop responding mid conversation. Especially when plans are being made. I'm somewhat guilty of what you don't like   I've said you must have gotten busy did you fall asleep things like that.  it's not just providers most people under 40. When a provider leaves me hanging I just assume something out her off. It's a tremendous waste of my time. I've angeted a few when I just went on my way and contacted plan B. If I'm showing my age I guess I'm showing my age.  How much trouble is it to say I've got something to do I'll text back later.

You do seem fairly neurotic but I can accept that it's likely a generational thing and not being able to understand or relate to younger people.

But you go and interpret it as *I'm not the most important thing to her right now :(* I'm sure you can see how that is oversensitive considering that this is somebody who doesn't even really know you.\n\nLike I just told, some things sell out quickly so 'Black Friday sales last all weekend' doesn't apply. You do seem fairly neurotic but I can accept that it's likely a generational thing and not being able to understand or relate to younger people. Chalk it up to generational miscommunication but you did seriously overreact and were infinitely more immature in your response.",
