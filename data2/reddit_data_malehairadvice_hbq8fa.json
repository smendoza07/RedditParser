And by that I would say that most \"modern pompadours\" are really quiffs. If it doesn't make you go \"ok, old-school, cool\" then it's probably not a pompadour.\n\nBut the original pompadour was a 1700s french hairstyle, so honestly what am I even talking about at this point?\n\nAnd none of this really matters, as long as you can use these terms to help you find images of haircuts you like :)\n\nEDIT: Heck, it's so big in the front, maybe it is more of a pompadour. Look for pompadour and quiff and you'll probably find plenty of cuts you like.",
