How are you planning on pulling off the beard without looking like an Amish man?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I'm not trying to be an ass hole or make fun of your beard on your cheeks.  It just looks like you have noticeably less growth on your cheeks than your jawline.  That was all I meant by that.",

I think the worst part of my growth pattern is my lower lip. I have basically ~3 months of no responsibilities which I intend to use to travel, work out, and grow my beard out. If it's shit in that time I'll shave it off before the semester starts. Also, I don't think looking like an Amish man would be too bad.",

And if you\u2019re like me and live in a hot, humid environment, it doesn\u2019t get nasty and melt like American Crew Fiber would. Just make sure you\u2019re applying correctly on slightly damp hair. If you want more volume, use a blow dryer and then apply it.\n\nI have some Blumaan Original on the way to just see how my hair does with some prestyler as well, so hopefully I can remember to let you know how that goes. I\u2019ve heard good things about Blumaan\u2019s Cavalier Clay too, but I\u2019d give Claymation a try. It\u2019s kinda expensive, but it lasts me 4 months. To me it\u2019s worth it because it only costs a little bit more than American Crew Fiber but works 10X better. Hope that helps.",

Just make sure you\u2019re applying correctly on slightly damp hair. If you want more volume, use a blow dryer and then apply it.\n\nI have some Blumaan Original on the way to just see how my hair does with some prestyler as well, so hopefully I can remember to let you know how that goes. I\u2019ve heard good things about Blumaan\u2019s Cavalier Clay too, but I\u2019d give Claymation a try. It\u2019s kinda expensive, but it lasts me 4 months. To me it\u2019s worth it because it only costs a little bit more than American Crew Fiber but works 10X better. Hope that helps.",
