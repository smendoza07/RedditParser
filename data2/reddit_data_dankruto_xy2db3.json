He was shy as fuck to read them about his books when trying to figure out Jiraya's code. Not sure why he was shy about tho.   \nIs it because he thought things were too dirty for Naruto to hear or because he is just shy about emotions like that in general?",

We rarely see him interact with women, but when he does, he always puts a lot of distance between the both of them and never really opens up. He more often approaches them as a disciplined shinobi, and not as a man who's putting himself on the market or showing attraction.\n\nHe also only ever gets familiar with a select few, which is something that's very common to introverts. Only his closest friends have the privilege to know his goofy side. That's, like, Naruto, Yamato and Guy. The rest of the time, he hides behind a rather formal and businesslike persona, which seems to be his comfort zone.",

He is the only character in Naruto who rightfully atoned for all his sins, paid his dues, did his time... and then went on to become a fucking hokage. \n\nIf this is called writing dirty...

Cause both those females had cheeky and feisty personalities that would play off nicely with his character.\n\nBut if Kishi would pull on Kakashi what he did with the rest of the cast and give him family, as far as canon goes - it would make the most sense for him to end up with Y\u016bgao Uzuki.\n\nBecause at that scene with the [memorial stone](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/40194/1067092-1.jpg), he encounters Yuugao who knew him from his years with the ANBU. She asks him why he is late all the time and his answer explains his chronic lateness and the deep pain he still endures from his past. He admits at morning, he visits the memorial, where he loses track of time while thinking about the past.\n\nHe tells her how he wants to stay there, living in his memories, how foolish he was back then, and how he regrets the things he did. Kakashi is basically telling her he has survivor's guilt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's a short and one but profound encounter. For Kakashi who never shows that much vulnerability, it means a lot.  \nThis is the closest he ever comes to willingly revealing his feelings to anybody.  \nI have never seen Kakashi open up like that.  \nHe reveals to her the depths of his sorrow and guilt, preferring to live in the past rather than the present.\n\nI'm still surprised how much trust he has in her to tell her all that, despite how minor character she was. She is basically the only character that Kakashi openly told about his emotions in canon.",

I mean it kind of works(I mean if Choji and Karui can somehow be a thing than you can't say Kakashi and Shizune is any less realistic). \n\nPeople also like the Mizukage Mei ship but I don't know how that could have worked. It would be unprecedented for two Kages from different villages (former or current) to hook up and have babies. I mean the politics between Konoha and Kiri would be awkward and maybe a bit tense because of those two. Remember the dilemma Shikamaru and Temari's kid brought because of Gaara being his uncle and Shikamaru being Naruto's right-hand man.\n\nNone of this matters at the end of the day because Kakashi can probably get some anytime he wants and is cool with being the fun uncle type of the village.",

He was shy as fuck to read them about his books when trying to figure out Jiraya's code. Not sure why he was shy about tho.   \nIs it because he thought things were too dirty for Naruto to hear or because he is just shy about emotions like that in general?",

We rarely see him interact with women, but when he does, he always puts a lot of distance between the both of them and never really opens up. He more often approaches them as a disciplined shinobi, and not as a man who's putting himself on the market or showing attraction.\n\nHe also only ever gets familiar with a select few, which is something that's very common to introverts. Only his closest friends have the privilege to know his goofy side. That's, like, Naruto, Yamato and Guy. The rest of the time, he hides behind a rather formal and businesslike persona, which seems to be his comfort zone.",

Always thought they'd be cute together. But, oh well... Watching him enjoy his life in retirement with Guy while trolling his former students and Asuma's kid like everybody's weird uncle is cool too.",

He was shy as fuck to read them about his books when trying to figure out Jiraya's code. Not sure why he was shy about tho.   \nIs it because he thought things were too dirty for Naruto to hear or because he is just shy about emotions like that in general?",

We rarely see him interact with women, but when he does, he always puts a lot of distance between the both of them and never really opens up. He more often approaches them as a disciplined shinobi, and not as a man who's putting himself on the market or showing attraction.\n\nHe also only ever gets familiar with a select few, which is something that's very common to introverts. Only his closest friends have the privilege to know his goofy side. That's, like, Naruto, Yamato and Guy. The rest of the time, he hides behind a rather formal and businesslike persona, which seems to be his comfort zone.",

He was shy as fuck to read them about his books when trying to figure out Jiraya's code. Not sure why he was shy about tho.   \nIs it because he thought things were too dirty for Naruto to hear or because he is just shy about emotions like that in general?",

We rarely see him interact with women, but when he does, he always puts a lot of distance between the both of them and never really opens up. He more often approaches them as a disciplined shinobi, and not as a man who's putting himself on the market or showing attraction.\n\nHe also only ever gets familiar with a select few, which is something that's very common to introverts. Only his closest friends have the privilege to know his goofy side. That's, like, Naruto, Yamato and Guy. The rest of the time, he hides behind a rather formal and businesslike persona, which seems to be his comfort zone.",

He was shy as fuck to read them about his books when trying to figure out Jiraya's code.

We rarely see him interact with women, but when he does, he always puts a lot of distance between the both of them and never really opens up. He more often approaches them as a disciplined shinobi, and not as a man who's putting himself on the market or showing attraction.\n\nHe also only ever gets familiar with a select few, which is something that's very common to introverts. Only his closest friends have the privilege to know his goofy side. That's, like, Naruto, Yamato and Guy. The rest of the time, he hides behind a rather formal and businesslike persona, which seems to be his comfort zone.",

We rarely see him interact with women, but when he does, he always puts a lot of distance between the both of them and never really opens up. He more often approaches them as a disciplined shinobi, and not as a man who's putting himself on the market or showing attraction.\n\nHe also only ever gets familiar with a select few, which is something that's very common to introverts. Only his closest friends have the privilege to know his goofy side. That's, like, Naruto, Yamato and Guy. The rest of the time, he hides behind a rather formal and businesslike persona, which seems to be his comfort zone.",
