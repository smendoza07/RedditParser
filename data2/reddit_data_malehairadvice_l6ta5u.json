Theres a volumizing blowdry within the same brand. \n\nJust remeber to focus the product on your roots and not the ends of your hair.\n\nOther helpful tips for volume would be not washing your hair every day (if it feels especially greasy before your next sheduled wash, just rinse and scrub gently with water, eventually your hair will stop getting as oily), taking biotin for general hair health, and keeping your diet relatively healthy. Healthy hair is generally bouncy hair. \n\nOne more thing, Biolage has a nice volumizing shampoo/conditoner that might be a good fit for you.",

Healthy hair is generally bouncy hair. \n\nOne more thing, Biolage has a nice volumizing shampoo/conditoner that might be a good fit for you.",
