He never felt like a character who's doing what needs to be done, because he's literally only seen being self-interested. Doing shit like telling everyone Naruto had the Kyubi inside him, ripping out Shisui's eye, manipulating a child Itachi, destroying Kabuto and Nono's lives, and allowing Orochimaru to do vile shit for sick benefits like the Hashirama arm was basically just to further his own goals of exerting his will over the village. \n\nNot to mention dude is a fucking moron. He's aware of Ao, a Byakugan using rain ninja at the summit, and STILL uses a genjutsu on Mifune. This could have completely compromised relations with the Leaf if he wasn't fucking murdered by Sasuke minutes later. He couldn't even effectively use the powers he stole. \n\nSorry for the rant, I wasnt trying to rant at you, I just find this character so goofy at times.",

So in other to avoid that, Danzo leak the intel, so that people can put all their fear and anger towards Naruto and thus keeping the population calm. I'm not necessarly saying you are wrong, but it's more or less how it works even in real life.\n\nFor the attack of village, in this case I think it's more to the fact that Danzo didn't exist as a character, but I agree he had no excuse during Pain invasions.",

Doing shit like telling everyone Naruto had the Kyubi inside him, ripping out Shisui's eye, manipulating a child Itachi, destroying Kabuto and Nono's lives, and allowing Orochimaru to do vile shit for sick benefits like the Hashirama arm was basically just to further his own goals of exerting his will over the village. \n\nNot to mention dude is a fucking moron. He's aware of Ao, a Byakugan using rain ninja at the summit, and STILL uses a genjutsu on Mifune. This could have completely compromised relations with the Leaf if he wasn't fucking murdered by Sasuke minutes later. He couldn't even effectively use the powers he stole. \n\nSorry for the rant, I wasnt trying to rant at you, I just find this character so goofy at times.",

So in other to avoid that, Danzo leak the intel, so that people can put all their fear and anger towards Naruto and thus keeping the population calm.

That's smart, and that's how we get little Gaaras.\n\nUsually after those kind of attack (the nine tails attack in this case) people will always looking for people to blame, because otherwise they won\u2019t feel safe and panic will rise. So in other to avoid that, Danzo leak the intel, so that people can put all their fear and anger towards Naruto and thus keeping the population calm. I'm not necessarly saying you are wrong, but it's more or less how it works even in real life.\n\nFor the attack of village, in this case I think it's more to the fact that Danzo didn't exist as a character, but I agree he had no excuse during Pain invasions.",
