It only makes things look more plump. The clean beard line for the jawline and the non spherical haircut immediately make you look thinner because your beard line mimics the jawline instead of having no definition and the haircut slims on the sides giving more of an appearance of a v shaped head instead of a circle.\n\nYou look way better dude, this is one of the best transformations I've seen on the sub.\n\nEdit: also I don't suspect you do this normally but don't shave the neckline of your beard so high that it stops just under your chin. Let the beard get to the point where the bottom of your jaw (under your tongue) meets the front facing portion of your neck and then follow that intersection for your beard line. Nobody likes neckbeard but you also don't wanna be the guy who shaves his bear so high he looks like there's no division between the two parts I just mentioned.",

The care really depends on the length.\n\nDefinitely incorporating conditioner and a good shampoo, regardless of how often you wash your hair. A difference in quality of hair products is really noticeable once it starts getting longer. Also, don't touch it so much, it can get greasy. Brush it, make that shit shine.\n\nI think being flexible with your every day style is important. In my case, at least, my hair is really hard to make look the same every day. It gets very wavy sometimes, or will only stay on one side, then the other. And sometimes the way you comb it just won't work anymore (also because of the weight of the hair). So, try new products, I found that sea salt spray was nice to give a bit of shape but also having a more relaxed look. For very formal stuff I would use gel because wax just didn't cut it. \n\nYou should still go cut your hair every once in  while to give it form. It will actually make it grow faster and healthier. I've seen some people that cut the sides shorter once they can have a bun, because it looks much cleaner. If that's something you'd be into, check it out.\n\nI mentioned it before, but brush your hair. Specially once it's reaching shoulder length. Hair tangles and knots are not fun. Once I had really long hair I would brush it in the morning and at night. This was mainly in one area that would always begin to form a dreadlock. \n\nThere's always going to be an awkward stage. No easy way to deal with that from my experience. It's a long, and often annoying way, but one day you'll realize you like your hair the way it looks at that moment. It definitely makes you stand out. Or maybe you won't like it, and it's okay.\n\nBest of luck! Upload some updates. Definitely go for it. You might go bald someday.",

I showed him a picture of how I usually have it. But I told him that I also like when barbers just do their thing, because they're the experts and I want to hear their opinion, and I was open to something new. He showed me a picture from Morgan's Pomade catalogue (I'll try to find it later), and he said \"what about this?\". I didn't think about it and I said yes. \n\nGave full control, no opinion or comment on what he was doing. \n\nSometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I've found that this 'letting go' thing has worked better in barber shops than hair salons. Guess it makes sense.",

It only makes things look more plump. The clean beard line for the jawline and the non spherical haircut immediately make you look thinner because your beard line mimics the jawline instead of having no definition and the haircut slims on the sides giving more of an appearance of a v shaped head instead of a circle.\n\nYou look way better dude, this is one of the best transformations I've seen on the sub.\n\nEdit: also I don't suspect you do this normally but don't shave the neckline of your beard so high that it stops just under your chin. Let the beard get to the point where the bottom of your jaw (under your tongue) meets the front facing portion of your neck and then follow that intersection for your beard line. Nobody likes neckbeard but you also don't wanna be the guy who shaves his bear so high he looks like there's no division between the two parts I just mentioned.",

The care really depends on the length.\n\nDefinitely incorporating conditioner and a good shampoo, regardless of how often you wash your hair. A difference in quality of hair products is really noticeable once it starts getting longer. Also, don't touch it so much, it can get greasy. Brush it, make that shit shine.\n\nI think being flexible with your every day style is important. In my case, at least, my hair is really hard to make look the same every day. It gets very wavy sometimes, or will only stay on one side, then the other. And sometimes the way you comb it just won't work anymore (also because of the weight of the hair). So, try new products, I found that sea salt spray was nice to give a bit of shape but also having a more relaxed look. For very formal stuff I would use gel because wax just didn't cut it. \n\nYou should still go cut your hair every once in  while to give it form. It will actually make it grow faster and healthier. I've seen some people that cut the sides shorter once they can have a bun, because it looks much cleaner. If that's something you'd be into, check it out.\n\nI mentioned it before, but brush your hair. Specially once it's reaching shoulder length. Hair tangles and knots are not fun. Once I had really long hair I would brush it in the morning and at night. This was mainly in one area that would always begin to form a dreadlock. \n\nThere's always going to be an awkward stage. No easy way to deal with that from my experience. It's a long, and often annoying way, but one day you'll realize you like your hair the way it looks at that moment. It definitely makes you stand out. Or maybe you won't like it, and it's okay.\n\nBest of luck! Upload some updates. Definitely go for it. You might go bald someday.",

Let the beard get to the point where the bottom of your jaw (under your tongue) meets the front facing portion of your neck and then follow that intersection for your beard line. Nobody likes neckbeard but you also don't wanna be the guy who shaves his bear so high he looks like there's no division between the two parts I just mentioned.",

A difference in quality of hair products is really noticeable once it starts getting longer. Also, don't touch it so much, it can get greasy. Brush it, make that shit shine.\n\nI think being flexible with your every day style is important. In my case, at least, my hair is really hard to make look the same every day. It gets very wavy sometimes, or will only stay on one side, then the other. And sometimes the way you comb it just won't work anymore (also because of the weight of the hair).

For very formal stuff I would use gel because wax just didn't cut it. \n\nYou should still go cut your hair every once in  while to give it form. It will actually make it grow faster and healthier. I've seen some people that cut the sides shorter once they can have a bun, because it looks much cleaner. If that's something you'd be into, check it out.\n\nI mentioned it before, but brush your hair. Specially once it's reaching shoulder length. Hair tangles and knots are not fun. Once I had really long hair I would brush it in the morning and at night. This was mainly in one area that would always begin to form a dreadlock. \n\nThere's always going to be an awkward stage. No easy way to deal with that from my experience. It's a long, and often annoying way, but one day you'll realize you like your hair the way it looks at that moment.

He showed me a picture from Morgan's Pomade catalogue (I'll try to find it later), and he said \"what about this?\". I didn't think about it and I said yes. \n\nGave full control, no opinion or comment on what he was doing. \n\nSometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.
