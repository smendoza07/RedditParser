Lifting weights will help almost more than cardio when losing weight, it'll lower your bodyfat% even more while dropping your body weight. \n\nThen feel free to bulk up. Keep it up, and good luck.

Putting on muscle doesn't affect your weight too much, but it does help to determine your BF%. You wouldn't weigh any less if you didn't build muscle. \n\nThere's good and bad weight. It's kind of hard to measure your BF% from that picture. Also BMI is almost worthless if you do workout. Someone with 13% BF could be considered obese and look better and \"skinnier\" than someone who doesn't workout and weighs less. ",

Shampoo and conditioner every 2 days or so. \n\nUse your best judgement on if you feel like you can skip them. There are days where I feel like it doesn't matter, or I just use shampoo. \n\nAnd no product. I tried clay to sculpt the top of my forehead to keep it out of my face, and although it worked, I didn't like how it made my hair feel. Overall just go with what feels right. Don't follow a regime because your hair is gonna be different to theirs - if you think you should do something, then do it :)\n\nGood luck!",

Putting on muscle doesn't affect your weight too much, but it does help to determine your BF%. You wouldn't weigh any less if you didn't build muscle. \n\nThere's good and bad weight. It's kind of hard to measure your BF% from that picture. Also BMI is almost worthless if you do workout. Someone with 13% BF could be considered obese and look better and \"skinnier\" than someone who doesn't workout and weighs less. ",

Shampoo and conditioner every 2 days or so. \n\nUse your best judgement on if you feel like you can skip them. There are days where I feel like it doesn't matter, or I just use shampoo. \n\nAnd no product. I tried clay to sculpt the top of my forehead to keep it out of my face, and although it worked, I didn't like how it made my hair feel. Overall just go with what feels right. Don't follow a regime because your hair is gonna be different to theirs - if you think you should do something, then do it :)\n\nGood luck!",

Putting on muscle doesn't affect your weight too much, but it does help to determine your BF%. You wouldn't weigh any less if you didn't build muscle. \n\nThere's good and bad weight. It's kind of hard to measure your BF% from that picture. Also BMI is almost worthless if you do workout. Someone with 13% BF could be considered obese and look better and \"skinnier\" than someone who doesn't workout and weighs less. ",

There are days where I feel like it doesn't matter, or I just use shampoo. \n\nAnd no product. I tried clay to sculpt the top of my forehead to keep it out of my face, and although it worked, I didn't like how it made my hair feel. Overall just go with what feels right. Don't follow a regime because your hair is gonna be different to theirs - if you think you should do something, then do it :)\n\nGood luck!",

It's kind of hard to measure your BF% from that picture. Also BMI is almost worthless if you do workout. Someone with 13% BF could be considered obese and look better and \"skinnier\" than someone who doesn't workout and weighs less. ",

There's no need to be at such a deficit, and it's not healthy, but you will still lose weight. The main issue is that you cannot possibly be getting all the minerals and nutrients you need, especially if you have days of just eating McDonald's. Losing fat does not necessarily mean healthy or sustainable.",
