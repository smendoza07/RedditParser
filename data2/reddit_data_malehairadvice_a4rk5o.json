Your natural hairstyle may or may not allow for this look. Go to the barber every 2-4 weeks (depending on if your hair grows quickly or not) and ask that they clean up the edges with a buzzer and the ears/sides with a scissor so as to not take too much off. To be honest, you might have better luck with a hairdresser. In my personal experience, I've found they're better at using scissors for the sides. If you're going to a barber, make sure it's not a buzzer-happy one. It shouldn't be necessary for anything other than the edges. I would show your barber/hairdresser this picture throughout the process and let them know this is your end result. Depending on your look now, could be months away. If you don't want to show the picture, I'd guess it's about 4-6 inches of length on the top, 2-3 inches around the top of the sides and about an inch or less closer to the ear.\n\nFor styling: I think someone mentioned using a blow dryer. If you have time, I think you'll also find good results by letting it air dry instead. That should allow for a bit of highlighting depending on your natural hair color. Product-wise I'd say a pomade - apply it when the hair is dry enough that volume has formed but with a bit of dampness to help with the shine.",
