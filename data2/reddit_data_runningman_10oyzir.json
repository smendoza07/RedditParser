They then show a highschool pic of her, they laugh their heads off when they're shown a younger pic of her. SBS wanted to go home from embarrassment. Whats not in the clip is very cute picture of her when she was still known as 'Mina'. I think she said after second pic shown was when it went downhill with the name change. They mainly refer her as 'Mina' on the show, sometimes even outside of the show.",
