    "body": "We get it. You want your peepee wet. We know its part of the game. But please, for the love of the sugar baby gods, please i beg of you, stop leading with sex. It's not cute nor funny and such a turn off (at least for me). \n\nIf we are just texting and learning to know eachother can you at least pretend to ask me about my day instead of sending sex jokes and innuendos and asking for more pictures when we have never even met. \n\nYes it is somewhat sex work, however we are still human and respect and decency goes a long way.\n\nSorry for the mini rant, just exhausted of \"daddies\" who can only and solely talk about sex especially when they are still strangers",

They're like, really good at it.\n\nDudes, all you have to do is not talk about sex for two hours and she'll almost literally announce that you've turned her on.\n\nI'm not even attractive - I'm probably flat out ugly. But these lames are so thirsty that all I have to do is not act thirsty to turn a woman on.",

When I reflect on instances of flirting that suddenly didnt materialize it was probably always derailed by me saying something stupid that was totally unnecessary.  I can\u2019t even say what those things were but I know what I was like in my younger years, and it\u2019s just statistically unlikely that something else was responsible in those instances.",

Which I will subtly run with.  While making my interest clear.  I never get explicit, until she gives an unequivocal \u201call clear\u201d.\n\nThis low key approach seems to really stand out in this lifestyle.

If many profiles request that SDs be upfront about what they want, it is going to be assumed that even the profiles which don't explicitly state it, also want the same thing.\n\nMaybe it is different where you are, because my geo is relatively small, but the vast majority of profiles I see request that.\n\nThe other side of the coin would be an SB immediately talking about money and gifts. Is that frowned upon or met with such scorn?",
