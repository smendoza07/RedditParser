    "body": "Ahhhh nothing like having a good \u2018ol meet and greet at a cafe. Pulling up and you see the POT standing outside giving off \u2018South side\u2019 vibes instead of Hamptons floral button up vibes as he was photographed online. He addresses you as \u2018Yo\u2019 and brings you over to the table where he already decided what you would be indulging in, a latte that looks like someone already took a few sips out of it. You don\u2019t drink coffee and actually wanted lunch, but I digress. \n\nHe sits down and all of a sudden remembers he parked his Rolls Royce in one of the 2 handicap parking spots directly in front of our table (so close that you\u2019re breathing on the hood ornament that has seen better days) and he needs to move it to the actual parking lot for the cafe, 20 feet over on the other side of the establishment. Because he is not handicapped. He slowly walks over to the Rolly, gets inside, immediately shifts into neutral, and revs the engine for 17 seconds straight. You ignore his embarrassing attempt at impressing you as you hear the brakes out from underneath the 2004 Rolly Rolly squealing away. \n\nYou start thinking of aborting the mission, but what if our conversation changes the pace! Southside daddy returns just moments later and the conversation begins. The proposition you may ask? 1/4 of the average PPM for the area, meeting 3 times a week. After all, that is hitting my monthly allowance goal, no?\n\nEdit: removing dollar value",
