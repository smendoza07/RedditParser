    "body": "Before I used to believe in \u2018all body types are beautiful\u2019. I did while i wasn\u2019t fully believing it. I\u2019m from East asia so we dont have body positivity movement as here in the states. \n\nAfter joining SA i realized its all BS. ( sorry for direct and rude word) but thats just how i felt. \n\nI was size 4 and i came across numerous profiles which openly states, they prefer someone petite and slender. When i changed my body type to slim, i was flooded with messages and almost every(9 times out of 10) m&g led to arrangement. In reference, i\u2019m 5,3 90lbs with long black hair and pale skin East asian. \nI think it was due to that i was always told i\u2019m pretty but i was chubby for my height, so when i shed the pounds it increased my chances. Weird incident was, there was a guy i met previously and he didn\u2019t remember me becsuse last time, he said i have nice personality but we\u2019re looking for different things. When i lost weight and he didnt recognize me and asked for arrangement. \n\nLot of SD state, they\u2019re looking for someone educated and hold a conversation but lot of times i felt  like it really didnt matter as i have calm demeanor. I only met 1 guy who questioned me about specific book and openly state that he doesnt like latinas as they are full of drama, but he\u2019s still searching for SB. \n\nAnd sadly race does matter. People say the most preferred race is white and asian, while it maybe true, its not. I think if i was white on same attractiveness scale, i\u2019d gotten more attention. Lot of SD who are not actual SD think i\u2019ll be lured into having sex with them just because i\u2019m asian and theres stereotype of asian girls being easy to white guys.",

I know that women get avalanched with right swipes/likes/messages depending on the app so I don't blame them for devoting their limited time to the profiles they really like.

This is under the assumption your photos are an accurate representation of what you look like. The POT goes in thinking you\u2019re already attractive. They do a MG to confirm your personality is sustainable for an arrangement. \n\nWhen sugaring IRL I think personality will always trump looks (as long as you are conventionally pretty and healthy). \n\nI went to a pool party and I still hadn\u2019t lost my birth control weight, so although I was healthy, I was 10lbs over my normal weight. Even though there were plenty other skinny girls at the Pool party, they were shy and not socializing like i was with the other men.\n\nI had connected with several men and three men expressed interest at some point (whether at the party or after a few weeks of texting ) to start an arrangement.\n\nLast Remarks\n- I think I read somewhere that men will generally opt for the woman who expresses interest but is not as attractive as the other uninterested woman.\n- All bodies are indeed beautiful.

            "body": "IN MY OPINION, guys in the Western world prefer this specific \"type\" of woman because that's what the Western media has portrayed as beautiful or sexy. I can't remember the exact timeline but I believe in the 1950 or 60s, the fashion industry in an attempt to promote androgynous clothing started using models that could fit that androgynous label easily i.e. ; skinny/thin, tall/slender etc. It's easier to appear androgynous when you don't have that much curves isn't it.\n\nThis spilled over into media (movies, music, celebrities etc) and has since become the \"standard\" of beauty and sexiness, albeit flawed. And since culture is shaped by media (whether we are aware or not) men have come to associate thin/slender women as \"more desirable\". They have been programmed subconsciously to find it more desirable whether they are aware or not.\n\nIf you look at Western movies for instance, the main woman is usually a beautiful, thin/slender/tall white woman. She is portrayed in the best light ; sexy, beautiful, desired, smart etc. However, when any other woman of any other ethnicity appears, she's definitely not portrayed in that light. For example let's use black women since I'm a black woman myself. In that same movie, the black woman will be a sub-character and portrayed as loud, comical, unattractive and sometimes just plain stupid! And that same \"character\" played by black women over and over for decades has created a stereotype amongst \"some\" men of other ethnicites that don't personally/intimately know any black women; that black women are loud, raunchy, aggressive and not too smart!  Which obviously isn't the case!!\n\nAll body types ARE beautiful in reality but that's not what our media has conveyed. So that's not what our culture has come to believe. You are always beautiful, sexy and desirable boo. Don't let anyone make you feel otherwise. Most guys don't even know why they prefer that specific body type, just that they do. Well, media is to blame. If it portrayed ALL body types as sexy and beautiful, we all would too. Look at \"super\" models, advertisement, movies, celebrities, music videos, magazines etc, its thin, tall, androgynous looking white women (sometimes other ethnicites that fit that type too) that are used.\n\nIf someone doesn't appreciate the way you are and only finds you desirable when you fit a certain \"stereotype\", don't waste your time on them. You are who you are, own it. And they either take it or leave it!",

Most (vanilla) men I know, on the other hand, have a wide range of women they would be willing to date (at least when it comes to physical appearance).",

(didn't realize that was actually a preference, more like the standard option)\n\nI had been planning to post a rant about my experiences with Asian girls specifically in my area, so let's just toss that in here since this post is already a dumpster fire imo.  For clarity, I just got done with a 9 hour meeting with my SB because she kept watching just a couple more episodes of Gossip Girl, which she has never seen, and then we would have more sex, and repeat.  I've been drinking vodka the whole time, because I only drink with other people so this is a treat.  Oh, and Seattle is burning so I had to walk her a half mile for an Uber to be able to pick her and take her home because police cars were blocking all the roads near my place.\n\n/rant\nSo, when I jumped back in the bowl three months ago I stayed true to who I am and decided to seek out data.  Without exaggeration, I have spoken to close to 200 girls in the past three months, described my ideal arrangement, and asked them what they would look for in a weekly allowance.  I know my market, better than any individual SD or SB.  I know PPM.  I know allowances.\n\n75% of girls fall within a single $XXX amount for either, 10% being almost comically lower (island girls), 10% being much higher, and 5% clearly whale hunters.  And what do you know, but the 10% above the market average were almost exclusively Asian.  Seattle has a large Asian community, and that percentage is expressed even greater in the bowl here.  This isn't Nebraska, they are not unique snowflakes.\n\nAnd yet, they invariably expect a higher price than everyone else.  For no apparent reason.  This extends from Asian girls new to the bowl, whose friends have told them they should expect $XXX platonic date fees and 2-4X average PPM and allowance, to experienced SBs that should know better but still expect at least 1.5-3X the average.  And when negotiation or a compromise is sought, there is nothing hit entitlement and derision for the suggestion.\n\nSorry for this, has been stewing for some time as day by day I experience one negative encounter after another.  Enjoy your evenings.\n\n/endrant",

None of those statements provides a clear reason why in Seattle specifically an Asian girl should command a higher PPM or allowance than any other ethnicity that isn't lying about how they look.\n\nAnd to be clear, half of my vanilla girlfriends over the past 20 years have been Asian.  I dig them for sure.  But I don't fetishize them, to me they are only as attractive as any other attractive white, black, latina, or other girl.  And yes, I have dated all of those ethnicities in the past decade.  I just like attractive.  Period.",

Also look at say white NFL or sports stars, they mix with non white far less than say the norm, which white movie star has married an Asian girl? There will be a few but it's super super rare Vs what you see on the streets \n\nAsian girls on average are more popular, since they are slimmer and more gentle and appeal more to nerdier/geekier guys due to the fact they are indeed a little more submissive...however top tier men don't care for this, so white wins out at higher level. \n\nI'm just explaining cultural circumstance as it is, it's not right or wrong (like how Asian girls love white guys) it's just a trend of what's going on today.",

Same same. \n\nMy theory actually supports what YOU experience so I don't know why you're so adamant against it, there will never be research done on this so of course it'll have to be annidoctal. However you can observe this easily, just name me a major white male movie star with an Asian wife? And then compare that with how many normal white people have Asian wives. You just want to believe the truth that confirms YOUR world view (what like white girls have it easy or white men are racist...who knows), but if that's the case why bother even posting on Reddit when all you want is a sound board.\n\nAs for Asian girls being easy on white guys as a stereotype (you say this as if your don't believe it), it is undeniably true, there is definitely a pedestal effect and speaking to Asian girls it's to do with an inferiority complex and fitting in, a lot would never even consider dating their own apart from maybe first bf or perhaps when they are 30+ and need to settle down.",

You just want to believe the truth that confirms YOUR world view (what like white girls have it easy or white men are racist...who knows), but if that's the case why bother even posting on Reddit when all you want is a sound board.\n\nAs for Asian girls being easy on white guys as a stereotype (you say this as if your don't believe it), it is undeniably true, there is definitely a pedestal effect and speaking to Asian girls it's to do with an inferiority complex and fitting in, a lot would never even consider dating their own apart from maybe first bf or perhaps when they are 30+ and need to settle down.",

None of those statements provides a clear reason why in Seattle specifically an Asian girl should command a higher PPM or allowance than any other ethnicity that isn't lying about how they look.\n\nAnd to be clear, half of my vanilla girlfriends over the past 20 years have been Asian.  I dig them for sure.  But I don't fetishize them, to me they are only as attractive as any other attractive white, black, latina, or other girl.

Being successful, in shape, politically similar, kink similar doesn't really produce the same interest.  I know that women get avalanched with right swipes/likes/messages depending on the app so I don't blame them for devoting their limited time to the profiles they really like. It's the nature of online dating.\n\nI've been out of that vanilla dating world for over a year.  I dabble in the sugar lifestyle looking for a woman open to the swinging/BDSM lifestyle. Now, that world is so different in my experience. People say it's impossible for single males but, no, it most definitely is not.  So many awesome people. Most, unfortunately for me, are already coupled but better single there than in the in a relationship in the vanilla world and unconnected sexually/intimately.",

            "body": "Fair enough but my experience on OKCupid, Match, and Tinder has been pretty much the same. Women value height a lot and go for the really good looking guys. Seen a few friends tinder gold or matches.  The great-looking tall guy is hammered with swipes.  The tall average guy is not far behind.  Being successful, in shape, politically similar, kink similar doesn't really produce the same interest.  I know that women get avalanched with right swipes/likes/messages depending on the app so I don't blame them for devoting their limited time to the profiles they really like. It's the nature of online dating.\n\nI've been out of that vanilla dating world for over a year.  I dabble in the sugar lifestyle looking for a woman open to the swinging/BDSM lifestyle. Now, that world is so different in my experience. People say it's impossible for single males but, no, it most definitely is not.  So many awesome people. Most, unfortunately for me, are already coupled but better single there than in the in a relationship in the vanilla world and unconnected sexually/intimately.",

Needless to say I couldn't agree less. In fact, there is plenty of evidence to suggest that [women prefer men when they know other women approve of their appearance.](https://www.businessinsider.com/women-are-more-attracted-to-men-when-other-women-like-them-2018-1)\n\nAnyway I've experienced dating as a thin guy, fit guy, and fat guy as my body has changed up and down a lot over the years. I assure you that there is a major disparity in the experiences between physically fit men and unfit men. Beyond what you'd expect, I imagine. It's the difference between being inundated with matches and being lucky to get any if you manage to take really good photos.",
