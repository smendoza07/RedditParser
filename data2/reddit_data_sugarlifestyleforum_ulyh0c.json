    "body": "So we all see these comments from that type of SD, right? I've seen a few on this sub, the other day I was messaged by one on seeking who said he supposes he could support me financially but would rather a \"real relationship with a true connection\"... first of all implying SRs can't have connections which is absolutely not true. I'd rather a lower paying SR with someone I really like than a really high paying one with an asshole (All I buy is fabric to make my own dresses anyway, I don't need 6 figures a month lmao) but that's getting off topic, my point is that those arguments have always really irritated me (as I'm sure they have for many of you) for a variety of reasons. \n\nFirst of all, I'll bet a lot of men saying they want a relationship with the perfect attractive younger woman without needing to be rich would absolutely tear me apart if I said \"I want a rich older man to just give me money without needing to even talk to him\", but don't see the parallel at all. \n\nIt also frequently comes across as shaming SBs for being 'shallow' and 'materialistic' while they themselves are usually not willing to date someone less attracive in their own age range, but they're \"just a kind man wanting a relationship with a pretty young girl, why are the young kids these days so materialistic?\" \n\nIf they don't want to be in an SR then maybe they ahould stop looking for relationships on SR subreddits and then shaming SBs for wanting an SR.\n\nBut lastly if they don't want an SR then.... what are they offering? Genuinely, because relationships work because everyone brings something to them. So, if these men don't want to bring a financial aspect to a relationship but also aren't willing to work on themselves, physically, mentally, and emotionally, then why should they expect gorgeous young women to line up to date them? And I'm sure some of them are working on themselves but the comments they make seem like they feel like they're automatically entitled to the perfect relationship just because they did a push up and went to therapy once. \n\nThe way most of them phrase it is so manipulative and guilt-trippy too. \"I'm just a nice guy \ud83e\udd7a why doesn't anyone want me?\" Well I'm sure people do want you, but I imagine you're looking at SBs because you don't want a lot of the people that want you. If you want your pick of gorgeous young women who are perfect in every way and would love to date you in a vanilla SR... well I want an absolutely gorgeous ridiculously expensive fountain pen, but I'm not going to expect one to fall out of the sky and into my hand just because I'd like it to, now am I?",

I wish I could just spend every free minute with you for free and all my bills were magically paid but they are not.\u201d\n\nYou would think more SD\u2019s understand opportunity costs.  If a SB is a bartender that makes two hundo a night then for her to be off and see you she is losing that amount.  So for it to be worthwhile you have to be offering a multiple of that.  If she makes xxxx a week and you want her to travel with you\u2026 for her not to lose money she needs the trip plus xxxx plus an incentive above that. It\u2019s common sense or at least it should be.  You can look at a meet and greet as a mutual investment to explore the potential of an arrangement but after that,  it needs to mutually benefit both sides.",

Ohh Lorelei\n\nHer: \nThat's why we need his consent, silly.\n\nFather:\nWe're getting down to brass tacks. You admit you're after money. \n\nHer:\nNo, I don't. Aren't you funny? Don't you know that a man being rich is like a girl being pretty? You don't marry her just because she's pretty. But, my goodness, doesn't it help? And if you had a daughter, wouldn\u2019t you rather she didn\u2019t marry a poor man? You'd want her to have the most wonderful things in the world, and to be very happy. Why is it wrong for me to want those things?\n\nFather:\nWell, I concede that. Say, they told me you were stupid. You don't sound stupid to me. \n\nHer:\nI can be smart when it's important. But most men don't like it. Except Gus. He's interested in my brains. \n\nFather:\nNo, that much of a fool he's not. \n\nThe Son:\nYou've changed your mind? \n\nFather:\nI just don't know what to tell you. \n\nHer:\nDaddy? Not you.

Warning: What I will say next will be a bit long, please be patient \ud83d\ude05.\n\nThis is what I told him: \u201cI am going to be the most honest with you; I'm not looking for a romantic relationship,  I'm looking for a mutually beneficiary arrangement that satisfies both our needs.\n\nStarting with an M&G I\u2019m interested in first an emotional connection where we both have chemistry and feel comfortable with each other, if we liked our interactions during our M&G then comes up having PPM meetings. And finally, if we feel more attached and we quite enjoyed our timeshare then it would be nice if our relationship could evolve to an allowance arrangement.\n\nI'm in my 20's, I have clear what I'm looking for. And what I'm looking for is to enjoy my life, the mutual cuddles and enjoy new experiences with my SD. Instead of being in a vanilla relationship without any financial help. \n\nIf living the life I want makes me a sinner and materialist in your eyes, then I'll happily be a materialistic sinner.\u201d",

If SD's want attractive young girls to be into them, they have to make yourself worthy of their time. The same goes for SB's, everyone has different goals and desires going into a new SR, hopefully we can all just find the best fit for us, have a joyful and rewarding experience and make some good memories.",

When I began investigations (huge thanks to SLF on this), another seasoned SB on SA talked to me about SR too. Note that both knew that I'm not a POT for them. Do you see what they did? They \\_educated\\_ me. I keep good memories about them (in my view that matters).\n\nCompare to what typical \"takers\" do: they ask what they'll receive, and block/ghost without an open and respectful discussion unless they're happy with reply.\n\nThink about it next time. You too can make this word better by investing a little effort, and educating people who don't quite understand how things work. Not even speaking about importance of finding common grounds with someone you remotely liked (otherwise why begin communication?)",

There should be no expectation of sugar because there\u2019s no relationship yet.  It\u2019s frankly inappropriate for the SB to ask for sugar before a relationship has started just as it would be inappropriate for an SD to ask the same. \n\nFurther, I know a lot of SBs seem to not want to understand this fact, but if M&G fees become a common practice, it *will* end the bowl as we know it.  If M&G fees become common, it is *inevitable* that the following will happen: 1) every toe tipper and scammer in the world will set up M&Gs to collect M&G fees, 2) SDs, even those who have so much money they don\u2019t care about the money losses, will become frustrated that they are constantly going on M&Gs that don\u2019t lead anywhere 3) no more bowl as we know it.",

Your comment is so all over the place to the point that it feels like you agree with me while you\u2019re trying to angrily disagree with me \n\nYes, an SD should *by* *choice* give a *gift* at the M&G.  I\u2019ve always done this whether or not I\u2019ve wanted to pursue an SR.  But that\u2019s a *gift* not a M&G fee, and I have nexted the women who demand a fee for the M&G.  In short, if she doesn\u2019t ask, we meet and I give her a monetary gift.  If she asks for it, we never meet and she doesn\u2019t get it.  That\u2019s worked quite well for me to find actual sugar babies and not scammers and rinsers.  The *one* time I agreed to a M&G fee in advance?  Rinser\u2026.  \n\nM&G fees are *not* common practice.  Read the forum, look at the polls.  There are people who do this, but not many, and if they became common practice, my scenario above *would* materialize.  \n\nThen you go on rambling about men who want sugar for free \u2014 do some screening and then go on the M&G and figure out if he\u2019s generous.  Don\u2019t go on an intimate date with him if he hasn\u2019t given you anything.  But don\u2019t be demanding and ask for something up front.  \n\nAnd, to your last sentence, if you can\u2019t convince a wealthy guy to give you thousands of dollars a month in vanilla dating, you\u2019re going to have to invest in a M&G to find someone who will.",

No anger here, dude. \n\nTotally, it can work both ways \u2014 then he shouldn\u2019t complain if someone decides not to pursue things further with him because he didn\u2019t give a gift during the initial meet. The entitled whining is the problem I\u2019m seeing. It\u2019s part of the vetting process for us sugar babies and it also depends on the caliber of what we have to offer. The gift is essentially the M&G fee for me to proceed but I still don\u2019t ask for it. If I get nothing for getting dolled up and whatnot, I won\u2019t waste any more time with a shit provider. If you provide a gift during a M&G for women you want to see again, then I don\u2019t see an issue. I do think women who demand a specific M&G fee need to be careful if they\u2019re not on that level to do so. \n\nVery rarely do I not get money from a M&G. I\u2019ve seen a lot of men and I also live in one of the biggest cities, so\u2026 \n\nOh, rambling is two sentences about the entire point of this thread? Lol. I think I\u2019ve gotten pretty good at vetting generous men, which is why I almost always get sugar on the first M&G \u2014 see, that only further proves a sugar daddy\u2019s generosity. \n\nI actually CAN convince a wealthy man to spoil me in vanilla dating (just don\u2019t want to put up with an actual relationship), which is why I can be even more picky with sugar dating.

Loving and being a good pleaser are two different things, honey buns! And whenever SBs try to make the sex better by including toys and just simply telling them how they can be pleased better, SDs do not want to take the critic and/or see the toys as competition. This is why almost wives just stop because majority just focus on they\u2019re own sexual pleasure and truly do not care about pleasing their wives so they show that same treatment to SBs. \n\nSR are not based on a foundation of an actual relationship (especially when the SD is attached) and those that are looking for vanilla relationships with their SB are truly bonkers. You can ask for exclusivity when one is unable to be exclusive and ask for free sex from a younger woman that\u2019s waaaay above your league. Bro??? Make it make sense with these SDs",

When I began investigations (huge thanks to SLF on this), another seasoned SB on SA talked to me about SR too. Note that both knew that I'm not a POT for them. Do you see what they did? They \\_educated\\_ me. I keep good memories about them (in my view that matters).\n\nCompare to what typical \"takers\" do: they ask what they'll receive, and block/ghost without an open and respectful discussion unless they're happy with reply.\n\nThink about it next time. You too can make this word better by investing a little effort, and educating people who don't quite understand how things work. Not even speaking about importance of finding common grounds with someone you remotely liked (otherwise why begin communication?)",

If M&G fees become common, it is *inevitable* that the following will happen: 1) every toe tipper and scammer in the world will set up M&Gs to collect M&G fees, 2) SDs, even those who have so much money they don\u2019t care about the money losses, will become frustrated that they are constantly going on M&Gs that don\u2019t lead anywhere 3) no more bowl as we know it.",

Your comment is so all over the place to the point that it feels like you agree with me while you\u2019re trying to angrily disagree with me \n\nYes, an SD should *by* *choice* give a *gift* at the M&G.  I\u2019ve always done this whether or not I\u2019ve wanted to pursue an SR.  But that\u2019s a *gift* not a M&G fee, and I have nexted the women who demand a fee for the M&G.  In short, if she doesn\u2019t ask, we meet and I give her a monetary gift.  If she asks for it, we never meet and she doesn\u2019t get it.  That\u2019s worked quite well for me to find actual sugar babies and not scammers and rinsers.  The *one* time I agreed to a M&G fee in advance?  Rinser\u2026.  \n\nM&G fees are *not* common practice.  Read the forum, look at the polls.  There are people who do this, but not many, and if they became common practice, my scenario above *would* materialize.  \n\nThen you go on rambling about men who want sugar for free \u2014 do some screening and then go on the M&G and figure out if he\u2019s generous.  Don\u2019t go on an intimate date with him if he hasn\u2019t given you anything.

No anger here, dude. \n\nTotally, it can work both ways \u2014 then he shouldn\u2019t complain if someone decides not to pursue things further with him because he didn\u2019t give a gift during the initial meet. The entitled whining is the problem I\u2019m seeing. It\u2019s part of the vetting process for us sugar babies and it also depends on the caliber of what we have to offer. The gift is essentially the M&G fee for me to proceed but I still don\u2019t ask for it. If I get nothing for getting dolled up and whatnot, I won\u2019t waste any more time with a shit provider. If you provide a gift during a M&G for women you want to see again, then I don\u2019t see an issue. I do think women who demand a specific M&G fee need to be careful if they\u2019re not on that level to do so. \n\nVery rarely do I not get money from a M&G. I\u2019ve seen a lot of men and I also live in one of the biggest cities, so\u2026 \n\nOh, rambling is two sentences about the entire point of this thread? Lol. I think I\u2019ve gotten pretty good at vetting generous men, which is why I almost always get sugar on the first M&G \u2014 see, that only further proves a sugar daddy\u2019s generosity. \n\nI actually CAN convince a wealthy man to spoil me in vanilla dating (just don\u2019t want to put up with an actual relationship), which is why I can be even more picky with sugar dating. Lmfao. It\u2019s the man who has to invest the most in the M&G. I don\u2019t have to invest much besides seeing if he\u2019s legit or not.",

There should be no expectation of sugar because there\u2019s no relationship yet.  It\u2019s frankly inappropriate for the SB to ask for sugar before a relationship has started just as it would be inappropriate for an SD to ask the same. \n\nFurther, I know a lot of SBs seem to not want to understand this fact, but if M&G fees become a common practice, it *will* end the bowl as we know it.  If M&G fees become common, it is *inevitable* that the following will happen: 1) every toe tipper and scammer in the world will set up M&Gs to collect M&G fees, 2) SDs, even those who have so much money they don\u2019t care about the money losses, will become frustrated that they are constantly going on M&Gs that don\u2019t lead anywhere 3) no more bowl as we know it.",

Your comment is so all over the place to the point that it feels like you agree with me while you\u2019re trying to angrily disagree with me \n\nYes, an SD should *by* *choice* give a *gift* at the M&G.  I\u2019ve always done this whether or not I\u2019ve wanted to pursue an SR.  But that\u2019s a *gift* not a M&G fee, and I have nexted the women who demand a fee for the M&G.  In short, if she doesn\u2019t ask, we meet and I give her a monetary gift.  If she asks for it, we never meet and she doesn\u2019t get it.  That\u2019s worked quite well for me to find actual sugar babies and not scammers and rinsers.  The *one* time I agreed to a M&G fee in advance?  Rinser\u2026.  \n\nM&G fees are *not* common practice.  Read the forum, look at the polls.  There are people who do this, but not many, and if they became common practice, my scenario above *would* materialize.  \n\nThen you go on rambling about men who want sugar for free \u2014 do some screening and then go on the M&G and figure out if he\u2019s generous.  Don\u2019t go on an intimate date with him if he hasn\u2019t given you anything.  But don\u2019t be demanding and ask for something up front.  \n\nAnd, to your last sentence, if you can\u2019t convince a wealthy guy to give you thousands of dollars a month in vanilla dating, you\u2019re going to have to invest in a M&G to find someone who will.",

No anger here, dude. \n\nTotally, it can work both ways \u2014 then he shouldn\u2019t complain if someone decides not to pursue things further with him because he didn\u2019t give a gift during the initial meet. The entitled whining is the problem I\u2019m seeing. It\u2019s part of the vetting process for us sugar babies and it also depends on the caliber of what we have to offer. The gift is essentially the M&G fee for me to proceed but I still don\u2019t ask for it. If I get nothing for getting dolled up and whatnot, I won\u2019t waste any more time with a shit provider. If you provide a gift during a M&G for women you want to see again, then I don\u2019t see an issue. I do think women who demand a specific M&G fee need to be careful if they\u2019re not on that level to do so. \n\nVery rarely do I not get money from a M&G. I\u2019ve seen a lot of men and I also live in one of the biggest cities, so\u2026 \n\nOh, rambling is two sentences about the entire point of this thread? Lol. I think I\u2019ve gotten pretty good at vetting generous men, which is why I almost always get sugar on the first M&G \u2014 see, that only further proves a sugar daddy\u2019s generosity. \n\nI actually CAN convince a wealthy man to spoil me in vanilla dating (just don\u2019t want to put up with an actual relationship), which is why I can be even more picky with sugar dating. Lmfao. It\u2019s the man who has to invest the most in the M&G. I don\u2019t have to invest much besides seeing if he\u2019s legit or not.",

Your comment is so all over the place to the point that it feels like you agree with me while you\u2019re trying to angrily disagree with me \n\nYes, an SD should *by* *choice* give a *gift* at the M&G.  I\u2019ve always done this whether or not I\u2019ve wanted to pursue an SR.  But that\u2019s a *gift* not a M&G fee, and I have nexted the women who demand a fee for the M&G.  In short, if she doesn\u2019t ask, we meet and I give her a monetary gift.  If she asks for it, we never meet and she doesn\u2019t get it.  That\u2019s worked quite well for me to find actual sugar babies and not scammers and rinsers.  The *one* time I agreed to a M&G fee in advance?  Rinser\u2026.  \n\nM&G fees are *not* common practice.  Read the forum, look at the polls.  There are people who do this, but not many, and if they became common practice, my scenario above *would* materialize.  \n\nThen you go on rambling about men who want sugar for free \u2014 do some screening and then go on the M&G and figure out if he\u2019s generous.  Don\u2019t go on an intimate date with him if he hasn\u2019t given you anything.  But don\u2019t be demanding and ask for something up front.  \n\nAnd, to your last sentence, if you can\u2019t convince a wealthy guy to give you thousands of dollars a month in vanilla dating, you\u2019re going to have to invest in a M&G to find someone who will.",

No anger here, dude. \n\nTotally, it can work both ways \u2014 then he shouldn\u2019t complain if someone decides not to pursue things further with him because he didn\u2019t give a gift during the initial meet. The entitled whining is the problem I\u2019m seeing. It\u2019s part of the vetting process for us sugar babies and it also depends on the caliber of what we have to offer. The gift is essentially the M&G fee for me to proceed but I still don\u2019t ask for it. If I get nothing for getting dolled up and whatnot, I won\u2019t waste any more time with a shit provider. If you provide a gift during a M&G for women you want to see again, then I don\u2019t see an issue. I do think women who demand a specific M&G fee need to be careful if they\u2019re not on that level to do so. \n\nVery rarely do I not get money from a M&G. I\u2019ve seen a lot of men and I also live in one of the biggest cities, so\u2026 \n\nOh, rambling is two sentences about the entire point of this thread? Lol. I think I\u2019ve gotten pretty good at vetting generous men, which is why I almost always get sugar on the first M&G \u2014 see, that only further proves a sugar daddy\u2019s generosity. \n\nI actually CAN convince a wealthy man to spoil me in vanilla dating (just don\u2019t want to put up with an actual relationship), which is why I can be even more picky with sugar dating. Lmfao. It\u2019s the man who has to invest the most in the M&G. I don\u2019t have to invest much besides seeing if he\u2019s legit or not.",

I\u2019ve had zero problem finding women who don\u2019t ask for M&G fees.  You claim you don\u2019t ask for one and always get the gift you\u2019re expecting, yet here you are linking a post where men are saying they won\u2019t give M&G fees as if that\u2019s a problem, then you come out with an entitled statement about how you should get a M&G fee (even though you say you don\u2019t ask for one).   \n\nHonestly you\u2019re too confusing to argue with further.",

I\u2019ve always done this whether or not I\u2019ve wanted to pursue an SR.  But that\u2019s a *gift* not a M&G fee, and I have nexted the women who demand a fee for the M&G.  In short, if she doesn\u2019t ask, we meet and I give her a monetary gift.  If she asks for it, we never meet and she doesn\u2019t get it.  That\u2019s worked quite well for me to find actual sugar babies and not scammers and rinsers.  The *one* time I agreed to a M&G fee in advance?  Rinser\u2026.  \n\nM&G fees are *not* common practice.  Read the forum, look at the polls.  There are people who do this, but not many, and if they became common practice, my scenario above *would* materialize.  \n\nThen you go on rambling about men who want sugar for free \u2014 do some screening and then go on the M&G and figure out if he\u2019s generous.  Don\u2019t go on an intimate date with him if he hasn\u2019t given you anything.  But don\u2019t be demanding and ask for something up front.  \n\nAnd, to your last sentence, if you can\u2019t convince a wealthy guy to give you thousands of dollars a month in vanilla dating, you\u2019re going to have to invest in a M&G to find someone who will.",

No anger here, dude. \n\nTotally, it can work both ways \u2014 then he shouldn\u2019t complain if someone decides not to pursue things further with him because he didn\u2019t give a gift during the initial meet. The entitled whining is the problem I\u2019m seeing. It\u2019s part of the vetting process for us sugar babies and it also depends on the caliber of what we have to offer. The gift is essentially the M&G fee for me to proceed but I still don\u2019t ask for it. If I get nothing for getting dolled up and whatnot, I won\u2019t waste any more time with a shit provider. If you provide a gift during a M&G for women you want to see again, then I don\u2019t see an issue. I do think women who demand a specific M&G fee need to be careful if they\u2019re not on that level to do so. \n\nVery rarely do I not get money from a M&G. I\u2019ve seen a lot of men and I also live in one of the biggest cities, so\u2026 \n\nOh, rambling is two sentences about the entire point of this thread? Lol. I think I\u2019ve gotten pretty good at vetting generous men, which is why I almost always get sugar on the first M&G \u2014 see, that only further proves a sugar daddy\u2019s generosity. \n\nI actually CAN convince a wealthy man to spoil me in vanilla dating (just don\u2019t want to put up with an actual relationship), which is why I can be even more picky with sugar dating. Lmfao. It\u2019s the man who has to invest the most in the M&G. I don\u2019t have to invest much besides seeing if he\u2019s legit or not.",

No anger here, dude. \n\nTotally, it can work both ways \u2014 then he shouldn\u2019t complain if someone decides not to pursue things further with him because he didn\u2019t give a gift during the initial meet. The entitled whining is the problem I\u2019m seeing. It\u2019s part of the vetting process for us sugar babies and it also depends on the caliber of what we have to offer. The gift is essentially the M&G fee for me to proceed but I still don\u2019t ask for it. If I get nothing for getting dolled up and whatnot, I won\u2019t waste any more time with a shit provider. If you provide a gift during a M&G for women you want to see again, then I don\u2019t see an issue. I do think women who demand a specific M&G fee need to be careful if they\u2019re not on that level to do so. \n\nVery rarely do I not get money from a M&G. I\u2019ve seen a lot of men and I also live in one of the biggest cities, so\u2026 \n\nOh, rambling is two sentences about the entire point of this thread? Lol. I think I\u2019ve gotten pretty good at vetting generous men, which is why I almost always get sugar on the first M&G \u2014 see, that only further proves a sugar daddy\u2019s generosity. \n\nI actually CAN convince a wealthy man to spoil me in vanilla dating (just don\u2019t want to put up with an actual relationship), which is why I can be even more picky with sugar dating. Lmfao. It\u2019s the man who has to invest the most in the M&G. I don\u2019t have to invest much besides seeing if he\u2019s legit or not.",
