    "body": "To keep a long story short.....I met a SD that seemed very sweet. We got along well and decided that we should get a room. The night was fantastic, he treated me well and I was completely comfortable. I should mention that I was very clear about using condoms, we talked about this when we were discussing our arrangement. He never brought any. When it came down to it I told him that I wouldn't be doing anything without one and he could go to the store if he needed to. Somehow he magically produced one from his wallet, but only the one. We got into it and I found out that he had taken the condom off during sex when I felt his load coming out of me. I was absolutely stunned. I didn't lose my shit outwardly, but I told him very firmly that this was absolutely not okay. He played stupid... I asked for money for a plan B and left.\n\n**Edit for update:**  \nI made an appointment with my doctor to be examined. I've asked about PrEP. Fortunately, I'm already seeing a psychologist so I plan to bring it up at the next appointment. Stealthing is not a crime where I am. I spoke to an attorney who said I could definitely implicate myself in a crime if I report it. All of your kind words are much appreciated. This kind of thing isn't something I talk to my friends and family about and I felt like there was no outlet for my frustration until I remembered SLF. ",

You should have walked then. My only other advice is that if you're going to be intimate with someone, then switch positions now and then. When doing so, make sure his condom is still on. If not, then get up and leave immediately Pretty sad you have to do this, but there are wolves in sheep's clothing out there \n\nYou did nothing wrong here other than being naive & trusting.

Before you even think about a report, find out.... don't report if it isn't a crime because -- as you noted -- they will make this about you and not him. It's despicable, by why add the police to your trauma if law enforcement isn't going to help.\n\nSadly, my reading of the state of the law is this a crime almost nowhere on earth   \n([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-consensual\\_condom\\_removal#:\\~:text=Non%2Dconsensual%20condom%20removal%2C%20or,a%20form%20of%20reproductive%20coercion.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-consensual_condom_removal#:~:text=Non%2Dconsensual%20condom%20removal%2C%20or,a%20form%20of%20reproductive%20coercion.))  \n\n\nThere is a national sex assault hotline that can recommend best practices as to what to do here. I will say something to reassure you a bit that will be disliked by many here: **The odds are this isn't some disease-ridden psychopath.** The odds are he's just a manipulative douchebag. There are places (and not a few) where knowingly giving someone HIV is a crime for example. And most men who are sugaring -- even as pigs like this one -- will know their status.   \n\n\nThe odds of someone have multiple STDs are low because their tend to be visible symptoms and tons of discomfort with them. I mean of course you should get tested (thought not immediately as there are incubation periods on most everything) but I'm cautiously optimistic that you caught nothing here.\n\nThe time to process and deal with this will vary from person to person and I suggest seeking any counseling resources you feel you need.\n\nYou have our support!",

I\u2019ve been in therapy a long time and I am very aware of when I am vulnerable and can\u2019t always do much about it other than work harder at putting up boundaries, not that that would prevent this man from doing that to you. @marker3000 is right- not a character flaw just something to be aware of as it is simply fact that women who have been raped/assaulted are MUCH more likely to be subjected to abuse again. I\u2019d say You are on the right track to healing and protecting yourself mentally and physically. Do whatever you need to do but be smart and fuck the police. Until you talk to a few lawyers, get a rape kit (someone said wait but that is definitely wrong as you have to do it within 72 hours), take a full panel STD test, see your psychologist and doctor. \nEdit: I meant do all that before going to the police but then I remembered that the police have to order the rape kit.",

I\u2019ve been in therapy a long time and I am very aware of when I am vulnerable and can\u2019t always do much about it other than work harder at putting up boundaries, not that that would prevent this man from doing that to you. @marker3000 is right- not a character flaw just something to be aware of as it is simply fact that women who have been raped/assaulted are MUCH more likely to be subjected to abuse again. I\u2019d say You are on the right track to healing and protecting yourself mentally and physically. Do whatever you need to do but be smart and fuck the police. Until you talk to a few lawyers, get a rape kit (someone said wait but that is definitely wrong as you have to do it within 72 hours), take a full panel STD test, see your psychologist and doctor. \nEdit: I meant do all that before going to the police but then I remembered that the police have to order the rape kit.",

When he magically came up with one when she made it clear she wouldn't go without protection that flag turned red.  By that time, she was in a very compromised situation and I'm sure it would have been difficult to walk out at that point.  This guy is a real creep and clearly knew what he was doing.  This is why stealthing should be sexual assault, but would be near impossible to prove in court.",

I\u2019ve been in therapy a long time and I am very aware of when I am vulnerable and can\u2019t always do much about it other than work harder at putting up boundaries, not that that would prevent this man from doing that to you. @marker3000 is right- not a character flaw just something to be aware of as it is simply fact that women who have been raped/assaulted are MUCH more likely to be subjected to abuse again. I\u2019d say You are on the right track to healing and protecting yourself mentally and physically. Do whatever you need to do but be smart and fuck the police. Until you talk to a few lawyers, get a rape kit (someone said wait but that is definitely wrong as you have to do it within 72 hours), take a full panel STD test, see your psychologist and doctor. \nEdit: I meant do all that before going to the police but then I remembered that the police have to order the rape kit.",

They are independent of each other, or would you rather the M&G be at the hotel itself.\n\nMy mentioning of COVID is because it's hard to find places to sit inside, at least here there are none. Can't dine in anywhere. So where else would you like to conduct a M&G? A park is perfectly valid (and better than some options).",

They mess it up most of the time and also barely actually complete it, there are thousands of rape kits that have gone untested this way. ALWAYS go to the hospital ASAP for a rape kit (dont shower or wash your clothes). This is valuable information for everyone to know so I figured i would respond here for those that may need to know this info later",

I\u2019ve been in therapy a long time and I am very aware of when I am vulnerable and can\u2019t always do much about it other than work harder at putting up boundaries, not that that would prevent this man from doing that to you. @marker3000 is right- not a character flaw just something to be aware of as it is simply fact that women who have been raped/assaulted are MUCH more likely to be subjected to abuse again. I\u2019d say You are on the right track to healing and protecting yourself mentally and physically. Do whatever you need to do but be smart and fuck the police. Until you talk to a few lawyers, get a rape kit (someone said wait but that is definitely wrong as you have to do it within 72 hours), take a full panel STD test, see your psychologist and doctor. \nEdit: I meant do all that before going to the police but then I remembered that the police have to order the rape kit.",

They are independent of each other, or would you rather the M&G be at the hotel itself.\n\nMy mentioning of COVID is because it's hard to find places to sit inside, at least here there are none. Can't dine in anywhere. So where else would you like to conduct a M&G? A park is perfectly valid (and better than some options).",

But I dislike it when people take my statements and misinterpret them before inquiring\u2014it impedes good dialogue.\"\n\nAnd you misinterpreted my statement as well.\n\nThe park and hotel are two separate dates, yes? They are independent of each other, or would you rather the M&G be at the hotel itself.\n\nMy mentioning of COVID is because it's hard to find places to sit inside, at least here there are none. Can't dine in anywhere. So where else would you like to conduct a M&G? A park is perfectly valid (and better than some options).",
