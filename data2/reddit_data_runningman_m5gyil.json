I'm not being biased or anything and I think YJS is really good at what he does, the best even, but he needs to slow down on using repetitive jokes. They're funny when used at right times but when overused tends to be annoying.\n\nAlso the setting seems much more free-flowing when you just let everyone speak then criticize them afterwards just like what they do most of the time, that's why we got the \"Should I call him oppa then?\" exchange from last episode. Maybe just let them speak, then make fun of them afterwards if it's a stupid remark or unfunny story. Don't just cut them off just to get the tradition alive for every episode.",
