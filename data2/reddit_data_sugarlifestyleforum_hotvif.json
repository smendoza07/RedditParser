    "body": "Went on a few dates with a POT, at one point he was going on about how anybody can be rich and if you aren\u2019t rich you obviously don\u2019t want to be. how he worked hard to get where he is and his rich parents didn\u2019t get him there all they did was pay for his schooling and cover all his bills while in school then gave him 30k to start a business. But that all has nothing to do with his success.\n\nIf someone gave me 30k with no repercussions of losing it my business would be successful ... \n\n\nFuck this guy\n\nWould also like to add that this guy makes a stupid amount of money (take my word for this) but kept trying to get me to agree to ppm That is half of the norm in my city sex multiple times every time only at His house\n\nBut it has to be half of the norm in my city so it\u2019s not about money\nBut it\u2019s perfectly fine to use me for sex but according to him isn\u2019t using me for sex\n\nEdit** messed up the numbers *",

When I wasn't around, he said to everyone else \"blue collar workers are blue collar because they didn't work hard enough in life\".  I'd ask if you were talking to the same guy, but I know he'd never be on SA.\n\nEff that POT.  While somewhat in the same boat (parents paid what scholarships didn't), after college, I made my own success without any help from my parents.

Those things have arbitrary nonsense values. One of the first such objects was the diamond. A current such object are limited run watches or limited run sneakers that are done for one reason only, to create demand by limiting supply on purpose though supply can easily be created. Nobody WANTS to create the supply because you make more money by limiting supply... of factory made goods.\n\nIf everyone is rich it means:\n\n1. everyone can get education to the extent they desire\n2. everyone can purchase services that they need to be healthy (health, mental)\n3. everyone can purchase all of the necessities of life (water, shelter, sanitation, etc)\n4. everyone can live in security \n\nIf you do that everyone is rich.\n\nIf you want to invent a brand of shoes that has only 10 copies made, yeah people will fight over them but that is artificial scarcity. The people buying those are not defined as \"rich\". \n\nRich is just defined as being able to lead the lifestyle above.",

People who have such immense privilege and deny so vehemently that it had any bearing on the success they claim as solely their own are hyprocrites and liars.\n\nHe might be great at business, but the point is that he may not have been able to start that business if he had had to work his way through college.

It builds over generations (20-30 years).  I am a child of this culture as are my kids.  Minorities to a large extent are children of generational poverty.  Lack of a safe, stable home, diet, education, and many other cultural norms puts so many people at a disadvantage.\n\nAt it's core, conservatism is simply about helping to pass all the advantages I enjoyed down to the next generation.  Not just family, conservative cultures are about the entire community helping the next generation.\n\nProgressives on the other hands want opportunity over community.  They want a level playing field, a fair race.  \n\nFascism (Trump) comes in when the conservative community breaks down.  Entitlement goes out the window as a generation stumbles due to unforseen, typically economic, forces decimate a well planned social structure.  Entitled jerks get pissed when they can't retire in their 50's to a big golf community in Naples. \n\nThe crash of 2008 killed millions of well-paying jobs.  Middle management disappeared as did all the positions that kept them safe for decades.  Guys making $150k per year struggled to find work for $50k.   The system was broken and they were refugees.   Life was suddenly unfair and they were too old to do anything about it.  Conservatism let them down and they were too broken to compete with the next generation.\n\nSo, Obama rides a wave of hopeful progressives into the White House while a huge chunk of the country tried to figure out what went wrong.  Along comes Trump with possible answers...Immigrants, China and most importantly...the old guard.   Trump became the middle finger to America...a chance for their formerly entitled asses to be heard.\n\nYou can't feel sorry for your POT.  He comes from a different planet.   A planet of entitled jerks.  Sadly that's my home planet too.   But, I recognize the other worlds out there as being very different from my own.  My Ex was from a different world.  I naturally assumed she would praise & cherish me forever for bringing her over to my planet.  I had no idea what a jerk I was back then (or still am).\n\nMy only advise to you is this:  When in Rome.....enjoy the culture for what it is...different.",
