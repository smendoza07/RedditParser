I'm not sure what you were going for here but personally I don't think it's a very good look for anyone really.\n\nYou seem to have a pretty good head of hair and I'm sure there's plenty of cool stuff you can actually do with it. There's nothing wrong with wanting to look \"different\" or expressing your individuality or whatever by styling your hair in an unconventional way. But if you were actually aiming to look nice, cool, sexy or whatever, my genuine advice would be to try something else than this haircut. If I'd bump into someone with this hairdo, I'd honestly feel a bit uncomfortable bro. Again, no hate! You do you.",

Run it through your hair then twist and let go some sections. It will look piecey/ choppy without the heavy gel look.  Fading the sides would and growing out the top would also look good and give you more creative options \ud83d\ude0a",

If it\u2019s the style you like maybe try a product with less shine and use your hands to gently set your bangs, that would be my advice! I hope you find the style that works best for you",

Then take a slim hair straightener, and straighten it all forward and down. Then you separate as needed, and you'll have very crispy, pointy bangs \n\nIts not the best for ur hair. But chances are you'll be getting it trimmed often enough since its short, so any damage will be cut off. I think it looks sick and I wish this style was more popular.",

I'd say if you want to improve it, you could make some more textured spikes that come out and up above the ones that are down on the forehead and maybe throughout the rest of your hair, bringing it forward in direction still. That'll add more depth/dimension to the style. \n\nDon't let others get you down. If you like your style that's all that really matters!",
