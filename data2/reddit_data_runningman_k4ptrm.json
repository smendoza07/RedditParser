(cant speak for newer eps) \nHe often subtly dictates to the other guys how they should react in these thngs, \n- ie over the top and outrageous lol\n\nHaha will just scream something stupid in a too loud hoarse voice and I will crack up.\n\n\nThis dialogue about rich heirs also reminds me of when Haha and Jaesuk are looking for a guest in the open , and they see a smart older guy walking past, and start discussing how much of a CEO he is. 'Two helicopters and three houses' lol",
