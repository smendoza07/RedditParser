I think that has more to do with the narrative of the show vs his actual ability since all his major fights were against opponents who had a kekei genkai (Deidara, Pain, Sauske, etc.) or used a forbidden jutsu. I doubt he would be willing to rip out a teammate\u2019s heart to fight Kakazu with his own technique. Still, it would\u2019ve been cool to see him use something like Shadow Possession or Mind Transfer because those are technically an ability anyone can learn, they're just a really well kept secret but with the sharingan and his intellect I\u2019m sure Kakashi could figure it out. He figured out how to do Rasengan huts by watching Naruto.",

All were given are things that have been stated, and I think discarding that in favor of feats is a biased means of measuring him against the others because we have the benefit of both feats *and* scaling for the others.\n\nWhat we know about Hiruzen is that he mastered all 5 nature transformations and knows elemental jutsu in Konoha. We know that he is demonstrably stronger than Danzo (which automatically puts him above Kakashi) because these are things that are stated.\n\nAs far as feats go, I think fighting the first two Hokage and Orichimaru at the same time on his own for as long as he did is pretty damn impressive, especially if he basically had to do so to a draw. Let\u2019s not forget that pushing Orochimaru in a fight is a feat in itself, as well as being able to wield Enma in his heavy ass adamantine staff form like it\u2019s nothing.",

With that, he uses Kamui another 3 times, this time however pulling the entire 8 tails in AND out, which would be a lot more draining than Kamui-ing something small, and is completely exhausted again. \n\nThen he is healed by Sakura and also given a 9 tails chakra cloak, which was stated to be \u201ca lot stronger and more than last time\u201d, so an unknown amount greater than 3x, (but to be conservative let\u2019s assume it\u2019s like 4x).\n\nThen he uses it another 6 times, after which his eye gets snatched.",

I doubt he would be willing to rip out a teammate\u2019s heart to fight Kakazu with his own technique. Still, it would\u2019ve been cool to see him use something like Shadow Possession or Mind Transfer because those are technically an ability anyone can learn, they're just a really well kept secret but with the sharingan and his intellect I\u2019m sure Kakashi could figure it out.

All were given are things that have been stated, and I think discarding that in favor of feats is a biased means of measuring him against the others because we have the benefit of both feats *and* scaling for the others.\n\nWhat we know about Hiruzen is that he mastered all 5 nature transformations and knows elemental jutsu in Konoha. We know that he is demonstrably stronger than Danzo (which automatically puts him above Kakashi) because these are things that are stated.\n\nAs far as feats go, I think fighting the first two Hokage and Orichimaru at the same time on his own for as long as he did is pretty damn impressive, especially if he basically had to do so to a draw. Let\u2019s not forget that pushing Orochimaru in a fight is a feat in itself, as well as being able to wield Enma in his heavy ass adamantine staff form like it\u2019s nothing.",

With that, he uses Kamui another 3 times, this time however pulling the entire 8 tails in AND out, which would be a lot more draining than Kamui-ing something small, and is completely exhausted again. \n\nThen he is healed by Sakura and also given a 9 tails chakra cloak, which was stated to be \u201ca lot stronger and more than last time\u201d, so an unknown amount greater than 3x, (but to be conservative let\u2019s assume it\u2019s like 4x).\n\nThen he uses it another 6 times, after which his eye gets snatched.",

All were given are things that have been stated, and I think discarding that in favor of feats is a biased means of measuring him against the others because we have the benefit of both feats *and* scaling for the others.\n\nWhat we know about Hiruzen is that he mastered all 5 nature transformations and knows elemental jutsu in Konoha. We know that he is demonstrably stronger than Danzo (which automatically puts him above Kakashi) because these are things that are stated.\n\nAs far as feats go, I think fighting the first two Hokage and Orichimaru at the same time on his own for as long as he did is pretty damn impressive, especially if he basically had to do so to a draw. Let\u2019s not forget that pushing Orochimaru in a fight is a feat in itself, as well as being able to wield Enma in his heavy ass adamantine staff form like it\u2019s nothing.",

All were given are things that have been stated, and I think discarding that in favor of feats is a biased means of measuring him against the others because we have the benefit of both feats *and* scaling for the others.\n\nWhat we know about Hiruzen is that he mastered all 5 nature transformations and knows elemental jutsu in Konoha. We know that he is demonstrably stronger than Danzo (which automatically puts him above Kakashi) because these are things that are stated.\n\nAs far as feats go, I think fighting the first two Hokage and Orichimaru at the same time on his own for as long as he did is pretty damn impressive, especially if he basically had to do so to a draw. Let\u2019s not forget that pushing Orochimaru in a fight is a feat in itself, as well as being able to wield Enma in his heavy ass adamantine staff form like it\u2019s nothing.",

All were given are things that have been stated, and I think discarding that in favor of feats is a biased means of measuring him against the others because we have the benefit of both feats *and* scaling for the others.\n\nWhat we know about Hiruzen is that he mastered all 5 nature transformations and knows elemental jutsu in Konoha. We know that he is demonstrably stronger than Danzo (which automatically puts him above Kakashi) because these are things that are stated.\n\nAs far as feats go, I think fighting the first two Hokage and Orichimaru at the same time on his own for as long as he did is pretty damn impressive, especially if he basically had to do so to a draw. Let\u2019s not forget that pushing Orochimaru in a fight is a feat in itself, as well as being able to wield Enma in his heavy ass adamantine staff form like it\u2019s nothing.",
