I would ditch the private photos - perhaps moving the bikini/shorts photo into your main batch if you want it to show your figure. Of the public ones, the hat photo is the least flattering so I would ditch it as well. \n\nAbout me: If you do nothing else - ditch the warning/disclaimers to start your profile. The please read will get a negative reaction. The warning about private photos .... well no one who will just 'ask' for them will ever bother reading that point so it's a negative for the SD's who do. Your double star section probably is not needed with your tag, but I understand why you have it, although I might move it to the seeking section where you cover that you want a man who will treat you as the lady you are ... and finish with the honesty after that. Basically a positive message. Next, your paragraph after your \\*\\* section reads as someone who wants platonic only.\n\nSeeking: Second paragraph reinforces a really slow build/platonic vibe. Also, the non-topping admonishment is something I would omit. You're trying to draw interest not push people away.",

Consider using it as your main -- you look so youthful, friendly, and beautiful in it. If you are going to make cuts to your photos (I read somewhere in this thread that you may remove some because there may be too many), I would lose the bikini pic, the pool table pic, and/or the hat pic. The others you have are higher quality and most flattering!\n\nOverall, I think your profile is well-written, confident, and descriptive. You've done such a great job and I am wishing you all the best!",
