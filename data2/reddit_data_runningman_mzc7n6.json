Dem, never thought that someone that makes you laughed for the past 11 years can make me failed to hold my tears in an important meeting. Thank you Kwangsoo. Your existence really makes my life far better that I'd ever imagine. Thank you.",

The fact that we can have 1.5 hours of entertainment every Monday after coming home from work really helps me to start my week and every 1.5 hours spent there will always be a scene where LKS made us laugh. Good stuff. I am not ready for this but with every episode I watch, I will always remind myself that they're getting older each episode and one day it will come to an end but knowing them from watching them for 11 years made us part of the group hence missing one of them is like we're missing one of our best friends. Stay strong fellow runner. All support to LKS and the team.",

If he called it a \"hiatus\", then there would be an expected date for him to return... by \"leaving\" this way he can take all the time he needs to recuperate without there being a strict deadline.",

Their chemistry *is* the show. Hope all the best for RM and LKS.",

But his health is the most important thing and I wish him all the best moving forward.",
