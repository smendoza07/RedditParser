    "body": "Hi guys this year we've decided to try something a bit different. Instead of publically posting allowance numbers on this thread we've found a way to gather information anonymously. This new format also allows us to go more in-depth without the risk of anyone doxing themselves.\n\nIt is my hope that this new format allows people to be more honest about their allowances, arrangements, and themselves since it won't be tied to their SLF persona. Hopefully this will help get rid of the backlash people get when they posts on the allowance thread.\n\n**A little about the new format...**\n\nIt is a questionnaire with 3 parts.\n\nPart 1 is General demographics. Age, marital status, race/ethnicity, education level for you and your partner.\n\nPart 2 is more detailed info about your arrangement such as are you exclusive, do you have more than one partner, do you do overnights, etc.\n\nPart 3 is about your location. No need to be vague since this is anonymous. It will help us get more accurate numbers for specific locations. Don't put Northwest Florida put Pensacola if that is your location.\n\n**Things to be aware of**\n\nIf you are on PPM or give PPM use the amount per a meet when answering the money questions not a monthly number. So if you get $500 PPM and meet 4 times a month put/choose that amount not the cumulative amount of $2k.\n\nIf you have more than one SR with differing information do not combine them into one questionnaire. Fill out a separate one or just pick your main SR. If the information is the same for each arrangement just fill out once. Meaning if you have 2 SDs/SBs and you give or receive the same to/from both ($500) than report it once as $500 not as $1,000.\n\nOnly provide current information. If it's not from an arrangement from this year do not include it or fill out a questionnaire. It's not helpful to receive info from your arrangement from 2020.\n\nDon't include information for offers you received. If you didn't have an arrangement with that person and actually received the cold hard cash in your hands/bank account don't report it.\n\nIf you didn't have an In Real Life arrangement don't participate. This is not for content sellers/cam girls. As far as SLF is concerned there is no such thing as an online sugar relationship and we don't want any info for that.\n\n**How the information will be shared**\n\nThis questionnaire automatically compiles the information entered into graphs and reports. A link to those will be added on to this post and will be updated weekly on Mondays until the window for updating this post is closed. So do not go through the questionnaire and enter bogus answers because you think you'll see results at the end you will not. If you have any questions or comments unlike in previous master threads you are welcome to discuss it in this post. \n\n**LINKs TO QUESTIONNAIRE:**\n\n* [United States](https://questionpro.com/t/AV3puZvkDD)\n\n* [Canada](https://questionpro.com/t/AV3puZtrB8)\n\n* [UK](https://questionpro.com/t/AV3puZtrg8)\n\n* [Europe](https://questionpro.com/t/AV3puZtrga)\n\n* [Australia](https://questionpro.com/t/AV3puZtrge)\n\n* [Other Countries](https://questionpro.com/t/AV3puZtrlU)\n\n**[Link to Results](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/xy8it6/allowance_questionnaire_results/)**",

If someone gets 25 good for them but that's not normal.  What is NOT impossible, but in fact rather easy is to do simple math on income comments from SB's (or former SB's on here) claiming SD's that don't make at least X (Say $400K) don't deserve them because they \"know their worth\" and \"won't settle\",  but unfortunately these aggressive SB's are about a 7-8 in appearance when it comes down to it, so how do you settle this debate?  Here's how:  Well $400k income puts any single person within the top 2% of earners in the country.......  So basic logic tells you that if an SB wants to pursue anything with that man she better be in the top 2% as well.  Not a 7-8 (top 20 or 30 percent).

It's definitely not \"creating\" anything in the SD world, since I doubt it's been seen by the vast majority of them, but it certainly is pissing off the SB's.  You're an adult so just stand your ground if you think you're getting lowballed or find another vocation.  Maybe create a site focused on this and spread your version.....",

I'm on the sugarstyleforum and saw it so of course I read it, but those #'s mean nothing to me.  It's a case by case situation obviously, so good for the mythical SB's that get 50k for a ppm from rumors I've been told (by SB's trying to get a bigger donation) and if another sb wants to do the same thing for 300 that's their decision.

I only heard it once from a SB / Escort who went to Dubai for one night and said it was a 50K situation.  I can't confirm hence why I said myth but it wouldn't surprise me and is by no means normal.  That proves nothing about your argument which I agree with.  Anything over 1K isn't a myth where are you getting that?  The format of the poll shows situations over 1K clearly (maybe not in the format you like).  I do know SB's in LV and LA that rarely get a 5k or 10k situation but those are exceptions not the rule.  They are also 10's / centerfold material as well.  Rates vary based on so many factors it's impossible to track, so if the poll isn't in the format you would prefer, and doesn't track sugaring the way you want to see it I would complain to the creators.",

So\u2026yeah\u2026 it\u2019s moved the whole market where SBs are willing to accept lower numbers because guys refuse to pay more. I refuse to accept and have not used the site in awhile because of this poll.  But many SBs don\u2019t have this luxury.\nI think this subreddit is dangerously pigeonholing the experience and reducing it to literally the experience to a sexual act or \u201cmeet\u201d for a set amount of money.  It\u2019s just using different words for the same thing, which is prostitution.  But an arrangement can be so much more than just a per meet allowance. Doing this only promotes prostitution and sex trafficking. But I digress.",

Let's talk reality though......you stated (middle to upper class SD's that make 200 - 400K annually).  This is what cracks me up because I've had this conversation and seen SB's interviewed and answering simple questions broadcast all over the country......when a clearly \"motivated\" group of women were asked on a particular show (google it I don't recall the name) how much money a man MUST MAKE for income for her to be interested it ranged from $800K to *$20M* annually (1 outlier at $150K).  Huge swing right?   These women were 7's at best so they were in the top 30% appearance wise and by no means smoke shows  HOWEVER when the host shared with them that (depending on the state) that the top 1% of male earners make roughly $550K income they were stunned, yet did not care.    It's really simple actually SB's and SD's should date in their league which can be defined, and Fluid has mentioned that a few times since she's mentioning income.  So if a SD is in the top 2% of earners, then he should be looking for someone he thinks is in the top 2% of available women as well in terms of whatever he is looking for (i.e. physical appearance, intelligence, athleticism, kindness etc etc).  It's Simple.  If you want to be an elite SB you better know where you are on the spectrum (are you a 9 really?). and educate yourself as to the caliber of person you'll likely deal with.",

I don\u2019t see how a family can live comfortably (I mean upper to middle class not middle class) without at least a combined income of 200k+.  A regular family residence in Cupertino or Los Altos costs around 6k-8k per month.  And it is said that rent shouldn\u2019t be more than 1/3 of your income. So you do the math.\n\nSo no, I\u2019m not throwing out random numbers. I don\u2019t even know how you tied looks in with this but you did.

You can try to spin this as \u201cbeing smart with money\u201d but wait actually NO, you actually cannot. Not with those amounts you are offering, sir b/c 150 per meet is too low, even for this survey (as it falls within the survey\u2019s minimum \u201cless than or equal to 300\u201d category).  That said, you\u2019re lucky that I\u2019m referring to you as \u201cfrugal\u201d b/c in reality, you\u2019re just cheap af. Sorry.\n\nAnd yes. I\u2019m sure there are many naive fresh 18 year olds that lack the confidence and self-respect to ask for more (and maybe there are older women as well) you are MISSING the freaking POINT, Sir.  Which is that this \u201csurvey\u201d does CONSTRUCTIVELY cap per meets at 1k\n\nAnd no, adding \u201c+\u201d at the end doesn\u2019t mean that the survey finds that 1k+ to be realistically within the data range of reference. In fact, I can confidentially say that anybody with a brain will interpret this data to mean that any amount above 1k (falling outside the corresponding reference region/range) are classified as \u201coutliers.\u201d  Which, considering inflation in the current financial economy, leads me to believe that the  moderators must have sugared back in the year 2003.",

I've been around this a while, but the women I used to hang out with, and am still friends with have all moved off of that site for various reasons and they were the top which in this market was about $1k.  That number varies though because if you're cool, have a good vibe, and hang out longer than planned you can end up in a situation neither of you intended.  I mean that in a positive way from experience.\n\nThat being said if someone wants to be cheap (Splenda) that's their right just say no as a SB.  Done and done.  Or maybe you work something out who knows?  However there is a wave of sb's trying to commit fraud, and who are career criminals on there which is a much bigger problem than a cheap guy.  The sd's need to be much more careful, financially speaking and with their property, than sb's even have to worry about.  I'm also too familiar with situations involving that type of thing, and am still shocked how many sb's think they can get away with committing crimes and not get caught?

I have vanilla dated gals I met on there, which was their idea not mine, with no allowance at all after a few dates.  So I went out with a bikini model for a few months for the price of dinners and a couple vacations.  Initially it was a k for a PM.  Not many sd's pull that move off.\n\n Like I stated above there are more and more sb's who are hurting all of you. They are so obsessed with their allowances, and constantly going on and on about money rather than doing what their sole purpose is (i.e. have fun and make sure you both have a good time)  that it's a huge red flag.  So much so that in several instances I'm aware of that red flag, and all the shady, greedy, underhanded thieving and fraud led to jail time.  \n\nIt's ironic because often the hottest, most fun ones don't ask for the highest allowance necessarily.  It's the demanding, greedy, inattentive 7's and 8's that give SB's bad names......along with the flat out criminals.",

I\u2019ll give you the benefit of the doubt and try my best to believe that girls who are 9/10 and 30 years younger actually like you\u2026and expect absolutely \u201cnothing\u201d in return\u2026 despite the fact they are on SA.  But it\u2019s more a credit to their lack of experience in the bowl and NOT b/c they prefer irrelevant 40 to 50 year olds.  If you think a 20 year old Instagram model actually prefers to hangout with a guy her dads age on a Saturday night in public just for kicks and giggles you might be delusional. \n\nYes, I agree all arrangements are different and not just sex for pay.  If so, then why are the moderators pigeonholing allowance to a specific monetary amount?  \n\nI love how you reduce females to a number (beauty is very subjective btw) to argue this effed up logic that females have to expect nothing in return to be considered a \u201cgood\u201d 9/10 SB. Ladies, this guy is full of sh*t, don\u2019t be scared to hold yourself to a certain standard and expect something in return.  Literally, by definition an arrangement IS a contract.  An arrangement must be mutually beneficial. Any guy who expects you to expect nothing is not worth your time.  Money is just a short convo. \n\nAnd to put females who have standards in the same category as those who thieve and assault guys is just unfair.",

Of course you need to be a generous SD, and BF if it goes there, in terms of trips, nice gestures, vacations etc....but yes a 20 something Instagram model will date a guy within 10-15 years of their age easy even off of SA.  It's not uncommon at all.  \n\nSpeaking from experience I can say that \"standards\" have nothing to do with being unrealistic asking for an arrangement,  that you deem a \"contract\",  up front before you even know each other.  It's exactly that type of SB that is the most dangerous type.  I'm very, very familiar with this type, and most are thieves / criminals, so if anyone encounters one that fits that mold I would bail immediately.  Run away...don't walk....not worth the hassle",

And yes, 95 percent of guys I met are neither ugly fat nor rude.  I never said those things. But you\u2019re trying to project this image of seeking as a traditional dating website when it clearly is not. The website is seeking arrangement not seeking relationship. The whole appeal of an arrangement is that expectations are clear from the beginning, not blurred like in a traditional relationship.  I also completely reject the idea that \u201csome\u201d sugar babies go into this not expecting any sugar. Money is the distinguishing factor in an arrangement.  Otherwise many poor older men would do it. And sure, you can say network and mentorship is a factor but discretion is important usually and most men don\u2019t want their cover blown. So I would estimate less than 5% of women aren\u2019t looking for an allowance of any kind and that estimate is generous. That said, only \u201cvery few\u201d women aren\u2019t looking for an allowance, not \u201csome\u201d women.\n\nAnd to the deleted comment, I agree that few ppl use this in place of tinder, me included.  But the big difference is both parties here do expect to give/receive and allowance. To not expect to give one is just rude and those who don\u2019t expect to receive anything are probably unicorns.  To state blindly that SA is the same as tinder and bumble is dishonest and misleading.",

So I've been with more SB's that bypassed the allowance conversation, went out with me, and just wanted to date a BF who would spoil them, than any SB who demanded a strict arrangement.

I don't need to be discreet or hide anything so there is no \"cover\" to be blown in my world, but I know SB's love it.

It's ok if people want to vanilla date after meeting there, after all that hurts no one!  What hurts people is having career criminals on there and the direct theft, extortion, & blackmail that is their goal.

If a potentional does not want to pay that, block him and move on. YOU set your allowance NOT THEM. I've seen skinny girls look all sorts of ways and I've made more then them in a single day then they've met in a month. Men like all types of women. Now when it comes to sugar dating alot of men run in the same circle so you get gross opinions as they share information on girls and websites. MEN TALK WAY MORE THEN WOMEN AND YOU SHOULD CONSIDER NOTHING SECRET WITH THEM. if we're being honest. They share their rosters in ways women just don't. so if you have 5 millionaire rich men they are usually sleeping with some of the same women as they will tell their friends who will hit up those women. Also alot of girls are high end escorts working under high end agencies and it turns to something else. Theres alot of smoke and mirrors going on women have got to stop believing it and letting other dictate how they run their own buisness",

And, relatedly, for lower allowance amounts and/or longer allowance periods. I'm sure plenty of folks here would call this \"splenda\" and not worth discussing, but seeing someone once or twice a year and paying their tuition twice a year for an amount that works out to less than the lowest allowance on the poll seems like an entirely reasonable arrangement to plenty of people.",

What is NOT impossible, but in fact rather easy is to do simple math on income comments from SB's (or former SB's on here) claiming SD's that don't make at least X (Say $400K) don't deserve them because they \"know their worth\" and \"won't settle\",  but unfortunately these aggressive SB's are about a 7-8 in appearance when it comes down to it, so how do you settle this debate?  Here's how:  Well $400k income puts any single person within the top 2% of earners in the country.......  So basic logic tells you that if an SB wants to pursue anything with that man she better be in the top 2% as well.  Not a 7-8 (top 20 or 30 percent).

It's definitely not \"creating\" anything in the SD world, since I doubt it's been seen by the vast majority of them, but it certainly is pissing off the SB's.  You're an adult so just stand your ground if you think you're getting lowballed or find another vocation.  Maybe create a site focused on this and spread your version.....",

I'm on the sugarstyleforum and saw it so of course I read it, but those #'s mean nothing to me.  It's a case by case situation obviously, so good for the mythical SB's that get 50k for a ppm from rumors I've been told (by SB's trying to get a bigger donation) and if another sb wants to do the same thing for 300 that's their decision.

I only heard it once from a SB / Escort who went to Dubai for one night and said it was a 50K situation.  I can't confirm hence why I said myth but it wouldn't surprise me and is by no means normal.  That proves nothing about your argument which I agree with.  Anything over 1K isn't a myth where are you getting that?  The format of the poll shows situations over 1K clearly (maybe not in the format you like).  I do know SB's in LV and LA that rarely get a 5k or 10k situation but those are exceptions not the rule.  They are also 10's / centerfold material as well.  Rates vary based on so many factors it's impossible to track, so if the poll isn't in the format you would prefer, and doesn't track sugaring the way you want to see it I would complain to the creators.",

So\u2026yeah\u2026 it\u2019s moved the whole market where SBs are willing to accept lower numbers because guys refuse to pay more. I refuse to accept and have not used the site in awhile because of this poll.  But many SBs don\u2019t have this luxury.\nI think this subreddit is dangerously pigeonholing the experience and reducing it to literally the experience to a sexual act or \u201cmeet\u201d for a set amount of money.  It\u2019s just using different words for the same thing, which is prostitution.  But an arrangement can be so much more than just a per meet allowance. Doing this only promotes prostitution and sex trafficking. But I digress.",

Let's talk reality though......you stated (middle to upper class SD's that make 200 - 400K annually).  This is what cracks me up because I've had this conversation and seen SB's interviewed and answering simple questions broadcast all over the country......when a clearly \"motivated\" group of women were asked on a particular show (google it I don't recall the name) how much money a man MUST MAKE for income for her to be interested it ranged from $800K to *$20M* annually (1 outlier at $150K).  Huge swing right?   These women were 7's at best so they were in the top 30% appearance wise and by no means smoke shows  HOWEVER when the host shared with them that (depending on the state) that the top 1% of male earners make roughly $550K income they were stunned, yet did not care.    It's really simple actually SB's and SD's should date in their league which can be defined, and Fluid has mentioned that a few times since she's mentioning income.  So if a SD is in the top 2% of earners, then he should be looking for someone he thinks is in the top 2% of available women as well in terms of whatever he is looking for (i.e. physical appearance, intelligence, athleticism, kindness etc etc).  It's Simple.  If you want to be an elite SB you better know where you are on the spectrum (are you a 9 really?). and educate yourself as to the caliber of person you'll likely deal with.",

That warren buffet would pay his mistress (if he even has or had one) 150-300? Are we talking about the warren buffet who is currently alive or one who existed and died in in the year 1912?

Because I\u2019m sorry, but I think I can confidently speak on behalf of all SBs that absolutely none of us are seeking a \u201cfrugal\u201d sd. You can try to spin this as \u201cbeing smart with money\u201d but wait actually NO, you actually cannot. Not with those amounts you are offering, sir b/c 150 per meet is too low, even for this survey (as it falls within the survey\u2019s minimum \u201cless than or equal to 300\u201d category).  That said, you\u2019re lucky that I\u2019m referring to you as \u201cfrugal\u201d b/c in reality, you\u2019re just cheap af. Sorry.\n\nAnd yes. I\u2019m sure there are many naive fresh 18 year olds that lack the confidence and self-respect to ask for more (and maybe there are older women as well) you are MISSING the freaking POINT, Sir.  Which is that this \u201csurvey\u201d does CONSTRUCTIVELY cap per meets at 1k\n\nAnd no, adding \u201c+\u201d at the end doesn\u2019t mean that the survey finds that 1k+ to be realistically within the data range of reference. In fact, I can confidentially say that anybody with a brain will interpret this data to mean that any amount above 1k (falling outside the corresponding reference region/range) are classified as \u201coutliers.\u201d  Which, considering inflation in the current financial economy, leads me to believe that the  moderators must have sugared back in the year 2003.",

I've been around this a while, but the women I used to hang out with, and am still friends with have all moved off of that site for various reasons and they were the top which in this market was about $1k.  That number varies though because if you're cool, have a good vibe, and hang out longer than planned you can end up in a situation neither of you intended.  I mean that in a positive way from experience.\n\nThat being said if someone wants to be cheap (Splenda) that's their right just say no as a SB.  Done and done.  Or maybe you work something out who knows?  However there is a wave of sb's trying to commit fraud, and who are career criminals on there which is a much bigger problem than a cheap guy.  The sd's need to be much more careful, financially speaking and with their property, than sb's even have to worry about.  I'm also too familiar with situations involving that type of thing, and am still shocked how many sb's think they can get away with committing crimes and not get caught?

I have vanilla dated gals I met on there, which was their idea not mine, with no allowance at all after a few dates.  So I went out with a bikini model for a few months for the price of dinners and a couple vacations.  Initially it was a k for a PM.  Not many sd's pull that move off.\n\n Like I stated above there are more and more sb's who are hurting all of you. They are so obsessed with their allowances, and constantly going on and on about money rather than doing what their sole purpose is (i.e. have fun and make sure you both have a good time)  that it's a huge red flag.  So much so that in several instances I'm aware of that red flag, and all the shady, greedy, underhanded thieving and fraud led to jail time.  \n\nIt's ironic because often the hottest, most fun ones don't ask for the highest allowance necessarily.  It's the demanding, greedy, inattentive 7's and 8's that give SB's bad names......along with the flat out criminals.",

If so, then why are the moderators pigeonholing allowance to a specific monetary amount?  \n\nI love how you reduce females to a number (beauty is very subjective btw) to argue this effed up logic that females have to expect nothing in return to be considered a \u201cgood\u201d 9/10 SB. Ladies, this guy is full of sh*t, don\u2019t be scared to hold yourself to a certain standard and expect something in return.  Literally, by definition an arrangement IS a contract.

It's exactly that type of SB that is the most dangerous type.  I'm very, very familiar with this type, and most are thieves / criminals, so if anyone encounters one that fits that mold I would bail immediately.  Run away...don't walk....not worth the hassle",

And yes, 95 percent of guys I met are neither ugly fat nor rude.  I never said those things. But you\u2019re trying to project this image of seeking as a traditional dating website when it clearly is not. The website is seeking arrangement not seeking relationship. The whole appeal of an arrangement is that expectations are clear from the beginning, not blurred like in a traditional relationship.  I also completely reject the idea that \u201csome\u201d sugar babies go into this not expecting any sugar. Money is the distinguishing factor in an arrangement.  Otherwise many poor older men would do it. And sure, you can say network and mentorship is a factor but discretion is important usually and most men don\u2019t want their cover blown. So I would estimate less than 5% of women aren\u2019t looking for an allowance of any kind and that estimate is generous. That said, only \u201cvery few\u201d women aren\u2019t looking for an allowance, not \u201csome\u201d women.\n\nAnd to the deleted comment, I agree that few ppl use this in place of tinder, me included.  But the big difference is both parties here do expect to give/receive and allowance. To not expect to give one is just rude and those who don\u2019t expect to receive anything are probably unicorns.  To state blindly that SA is the same as tinder and bumble is dishonest and misleading.",

I've had 3 vanilla relationships off of SA, which wasn't the plan, but they may be in that 5% number you mentioned.  So I've been with more SB's that bypassed the allowance conversation, went out with me, and just wanted to date a BF who would spoil them, than any SB who demanded a strict arrangement.  That's an anomaly I get it but that was reality for me.\n\nOH plus the fact that the only typical SB situations I had ended up with criminal charges against both.  Fraud.  I don't need to be discreet or hide anything so there is no \"cover\" to be blown in my world, but I know SB's love it.  They love pitching \"discretion\" and \"secrecy\" because I know of too many of them that extort / blackmail married men as a criminal enterprise and plan it from the very beginning.  \n\nSA is an arrangement site plan and simple.  It's ok if people want to vanilla date after meeting there, after all that hurts no one!  What hurts people is having career criminals on there and the direct theft, extortion, & blackmail that is their goal.

(by the way it doesn't) It took you 3 hours! And that's the best you could come up with?  lol and you still don't get what's wrong with that other comment.

I only heard it once from a SB / Escort who went to Dubai for one night and said it was a 50K situation.  I can't confirm hence why I said myth but it wouldn't surprise me and is by no means normal.  That proves nothing about your argument which I agree with.  Anything over 1K isn't a myth where are you getting that?  The format of the poll shows situations over 1K clearly (maybe not in the format you like).  I do know SB's in LV and LA that rarely get a 5k or 10k situation but those are exceptions not the rule.  They are also 10's / centerfold material as well.  Rates vary based on so many factors it's impossible to track, so if the poll isn't in the format you would prefer, and doesn't track sugaring the way you want to see it I would complain to the creators.",

It\u2019s just using different words for the same thing, which is prostitution.  But an arrangement can be so much more than just a per meet allowance.

Let's talk reality though......you stated (middle to upper class SD's that make 200 - 400K annually).  This is what cracks me up because I've had this conversation and seen SB's interviewed and answering simple questions broadcast all over the country......when a clearly \"motivated\" group of women were asked on a particular show (google it I don't recall the name) how much money a man MUST MAKE for income for her to be interested it ranged from $800K to *$20M* annually (1 outlier at $150K).  Huge swing right?   These women were 7's at best so they were in the top 30% appearance wise and by no means smoke shows  HOWEVER when the host shared with them that (depending on the state) that the top 1% of male earners make roughly $550K income they were stunned, yet did not care.    It's really simple actually SB's and SD's should date in their league which can be defined, and Fluid has mentioned that a few times since she's mentioning income.  So if a SD is in the top 2% of earners, then he should be looking for someone he thinks is in the top 2% of available women as well in terms of whatever he is looking for (i.e. physical appearance, intelligence, athleticism, kindness etc etc).  It's Simple.  If you want to be an elite SB you better know where you are on the spectrum (are you a 9 really?). and educate yourself as to the caliber of person you'll likely deal with.",

Think about what you\u2019re saying\u2026what can you buy with 150??? A full tank of gas and maybe 3.5% of an iPhone?\n\nAnd what argument are you even making? That warren buffet would pay his mistress (if he even has or had one) 150-300? Are we talking about the warren buffet who is currently alive or one who existed and died in in the year 1912? (Btw, no I don\u2019t really mean the year 1912 it is called sarcasm)\n\nMoreover, while I am so mildly impressed that you are \u201cfrugal\u201d with your money\u2026ummm\u2026what are you expecting\u2026 a cookie? Because I\u2019m sorry, but I think I can confidently speak on behalf of all SBs that absolutely none of us are seeking a \u201cfrugal\u201d sd. You can try to spin this as \u201cbeing smart with money\u201d but wait actually NO, you actually cannot. Not with those amounts you are offering, sir b/c 150 per meet is too low, even for this survey (as it falls within the survey\u2019s minimum \u201cless than or equal to 300\u201d category).  That said, you\u2019re lucky that I\u2019m referring to you as \u201cfrugal\u201d b/c in reality, you\u2019re just cheap af. Sorry.\n\nAnd yes. I\u2019m sure there are many naive fresh 18 year olds that lack the confidence and self-respect to ask for more (and maybe there are older women as well) you are MISSING the freaking POINT, Sir.  Which is that this \u201csurvey\u201d does CONSTRUCTIVELY cap per meets at 1k\n\nAnd no, adding \u201c+\u201d at the end doesn\u2019t mean that the survey finds that 1k+ to be realistically within the data range of reference. In fact, I can confidentially say that anybody with a brain will interpret this data to mean that any amount above 1k (falling outside the corresponding reference region/range) are classified as \u201coutliers.\u201d  Which, considering inflation in the current financial economy, leads me to believe that the  moderators must have sugared back in the year 2003.",

Or maybe you work something out who knows?  However there is a wave of sb's trying to commit fraud, and who are career criminals on there which is a much bigger problem than a cheap guy.  The sd's need to be much more careful, financially speaking and with their property, than sb's even have to worry about.

I have vanilla dated gals I met on there, which was their idea not mine, with no allowance at all after a few dates.  So I went out with a bikini model for a few months for the price of dinners and a couple vacations.  Initially it was a k for a PM.  Not many sd's pull that move off.\n\n Like I stated above there are more and more sb's who are hurting all of you. They are so obsessed with their allowances, and constantly going on and on about money rather than doing what their sole purpose is (i.e. have fun and make sure you both have a good time)  that it's a huge red flag.  So much so that in several instances I'm aware of that red flag, and all the shady, greedy, underhanded thieving and fraud led to jail time.  \n\nIt's ironic because often the hottest, most fun ones don't ask for the highest allowance necessarily.  It's the demanding, greedy, inattentive 7's and 8's that give SB's bad names......along with the flat out criminals.",

Some are simply dating up. Some are looking for something that resembles a relationship rather than a contract. Some will not even be looking for cash! And I\u2019m not talking about women who couldn\u2019t command a decent allowance bc they\u2019re too old or not attractive enough. Some want a successful guy and an arrangement with boundaries more than some pay for sex thing. I\u2019m saying this bc they\u2019re the women I sometimes encounter. 20-30 years younger than me. Gorgeous GND students. They actually like me\u2026Now some on this forum cannot believe this or don\u2019t want to or find it somehow offensive\u2026.Whatever. Downvotes expected \ud83e\udd23",

I\u2019ll give you the benefit of the doubt and try my best to believe that girls who are 9/10 and 30 years younger actually like you\u2026and expect absolutely \u201cnothing\u201d in return\u2026 despite the fact they are on SA.  But it\u2019s more a credit to their lack of experience in the bowl and NOT b/c they prefer irrelevant 40 to 50 year olds.  If you think a 20 year old Instagram model actually prefers to hangout with a guy her dads age on a Saturday night in public just for kicks and giggles you might be delusional. \n\nYes, I agree all arrangements are different and not just sex for pay.  If so, then why are the moderators pigeonholing allowance to a specific monetary amount?  \n\nI love how you reduce females to a number (beauty is very subjective btw) to argue this effed up logic that females have to expect nothing in return to be considered a \u201cgood\u201d 9/10 SB. Ladies, this guy is full of sh*t, don\u2019t be scared to hold yourself to a certain standard and expect something in return.  Literally, by definition an arrangement IS a contract.  An arrangement must be mutually beneficial. Any guy who expects you to expect nothing is not worth your time.  Money is just a short convo. \n\nAnd to put females who have standards in the same category as those who thieve and assault guys is just unfair.",

Of course you need to be a generous SD, and BF if it goes there, in terms of trips, nice gestures, vacations etc....but yes a 20 something Instagram model will date a guy within 10-15 years of their age easy even off of SA.  It's not uncommon at all.  \n\nSpeaking from experience I can say that \"standards\" have nothing to do with being unrealistic asking for an arrangement,  that you deem a \"contract\",  up front before you even know each other.  It's exactly that type of SB that is the most dangerous type.  I'm very, very familiar with this type, and most are thieves / criminals, so if anyone encounters one that fits that mold I would bail immediately.  Run away...don't walk....not worth the hassle",

And yes, 95 percent of guys I met are neither ugly fat nor rude.  I never said those things. But you\u2019re trying to project this image of seeking as a traditional dating website when it clearly is not. The website is seeking arrangement not seeking relationship. The whole appeal of an arrangement is that expectations are clear from the beginning, not blurred like in a traditional relationship.  I also completely reject the idea that \u201csome\u201d sugar babies go into this not expecting any sugar. Money is the distinguishing factor in an arrangement.  Otherwise many poor older men would do it. And sure, you can say network and mentorship is a factor but discretion is important usually and most men don\u2019t want their cover blown. So I would estimate less than 5% of women aren\u2019t looking for an allowance of any kind and that estimate is generous. That said, only \u201cvery few\u201d women aren\u2019t looking for an allowance, not \u201csome\u201d women.\n\nAnd to the deleted comment, I agree that few ppl use this in place of tinder, me included.  But the big difference is both parties here do expect to give/receive and allowance. To not expect to give one is just rude and those who don\u2019t expect to receive anything are probably unicorns.  To state blindly that SA is the same as tinder and bumble is dishonest and misleading.",

So I've been with more SB's that bypassed the allowance conversation, went out with me, and just wanted to date a BF who would spoil them, than any SB who demanded a strict arrangement.  That's an anomaly I get it but that was reality for me.\n\nOH plus the fact that the only typical SB situations I had ended up with criminal charges against both.  Fraud.  I don't need to be discreet or hide anything so there is no \"cover\" to be blown in my world, but I know SB's love it.  They love pitching \"discretion\" and \"secrecy\" because I know of too many of them that extort / blackmail married men as a criminal enterprise and plan it from the very beginning.  \n\nSA is an arrangement site plan and simple.  It's ok if people want to vanilla date after meeting there, after all that hurts no one!  What hurts people is having career criminals on there and the direct theft, extortion, & blackmail that is their goal.

And the 150 you mentioned does not instill any confidence that you can actually take care of me. That amount is actually insulting to say the least.  There are plenty of younger lower working class men who can afford and are willing to pay that amount to their local corner street hooker (no offense but 150 I\u2019m sure is likely within that range)",

I only heard it once from a SB / Escort who went to Dubai for one night and said it was a 50K situation.  I can't confirm hence why I said myth but it wouldn't surprise me and is by no means normal.  That proves nothing about your argument which I agree with.  Anything over 1K isn't a myth where are you getting that?  The format of the poll shows situations over 1K clearly (maybe not in the format you like).  I do know SB's in LV and LA that rarely get a 5k or 10k situation but those are exceptions not the rule.  They are also 10's / centerfold material as well.  Rates vary based on so many factors it's impossible to track, so if the poll isn't in the format you would prefer, and doesn't track sugaring the way you want to see it I would complain to the creators.",

It\u2019s just using different words for the same thing, which is prostitution.  But an arrangement can be so much more than just a per meet allowance.

Let's talk reality though......you stated (middle to upper class SD's that make 200 - 400K annually).  This is what cracks me up because I've had this conversation and seen SB's interviewed and answering simple questions broadcast all over the country......when a clearly \"motivated\" group of women were asked on a particular show (google it I don't recall the name) how much money a man MUST MAKE for income for her to be interested it ranged from $800K to *$20M* annually (1 outlier at $150K).  Huge swing right?   These women were 7's at best so they were in the top 30% appearance wise and by no means smoke shows  HOWEVER when the host shared with them that (depending on the state) that the top 1% of male earners make roughly $550K income they were stunned, yet did not care.    It's really simple actually SB's and SD's should date in their league which can be defined, and Fluid has mentioned that a few times since she's mentioning income.  So if a SD is in the top 2% of earners, then he should be looking for someone he thinks is in the top 2% of available women as well in terms of whatever he is looking for (i.e. physical appearance, intelligence, athleticism, kindness etc etc).  It's Simple.  If you want to be an elite SB you better know where you are on the spectrum (are you a 9 really?). and educate yourself as to the caliber of person you'll likely deal with.",

Think about what you\u2019re saying\u2026what can you buy with 150??? A full tank of gas and maybe 3.5% of an iPhone?\n\nAnd what argument are you even making? That warren buffet would pay his mistress (if he even has or had one) 150-300? Are we talking about the warren buffet who is currently alive or one who existed and died in in the year 1912? (Btw, no I don\u2019t really mean the year 1912 it is called sarcasm)\n\nMoreover, while I am so mildly impressed that you are \u201cfrugal\u201d with your money\u2026ummm\u2026what are you expecting\u2026 a cookie? Because I\u2019m sorry, but I think I can confidently speak on behalf of all SBs that absolutely none of us are seeking a \u201cfrugal\u201d sd. You can try to spin this as \u201cbeing smart with money\u201d but wait actually NO, you actually cannot. Not with those amounts you are offering, sir b/c 150 per meet is too low, even for this survey (as it falls within the survey\u2019s minimum \u201cless than or equal to 300\u201d category).  That said, you\u2019re lucky that I\u2019m referring to you as \u201cfrugal\u201d b/c in reality, you\u2019re just cheap af. Sorry.\n\nAnd yes. I\u2019m sure there are many naive fresh 18 year olds that lack the confidence and self-respect to ask for more (and maybe there are older women as well) you are MISSING the freaking POINT, Sir.  Which is that this \u201csurvey\u201d does CONSTRUCTIVELY cap per meets at 1k\n\nAnd no, adding \u201c+\u201d at the end doesn\u2019t mean that the survey finds that 1k+ to be realistically within the data range of reference. In fact, I can confidentially say that anybody with a brain will interpret this data to mean that any amount above 1k (falling outside the corresponding reference region/range) are classified as \u201coutliers.\u201d  Which, considering inflation in the current financial economy, leads me to believe that the  moderators must have sugared back in the year 2003.",

I've been around this a while, but the women I used to hang out with, and am still friends with have all moved off of that site for various reasons and they were the top which in this market was about $1k.  That number varies though because if you're cool, have a good vibe, and hang out longer than planned you can end up in a situation neither of you intended.  I mean that in a positive way from experience.\n\nThat being said if someone wants to be cheap (Splenda) that's their right just say no as a SB.  Done and done.  Or maybe you work something out who knows?  However there is a wave of sb's trying to commit fraud, and who are career criminals on there which is a much bigger problem than a cheap guy.  The sd's need to be much more careful, financially speaking and with their property, than sb's even have to worry about.  I'm also too familiar with situations involving that type of thing, and am still shocked how many sb's think they can get away with committing crimes and not get caught?

I have vanilla dated gals I met on there, which was their idea not mine, with no allowance at all after a few dates.  So I went out with a bikini model for a few months for the price of dinners and a couple vacations.  Initially it was a k for a PM.  Not many sd's pull that move off.\n\n Like I stated above there are more and more sb's who are hurting all of you. They are so obsessed with their allowances, and constantly going on and on about money rather than doing what their sole purpose is (i.e. have fun and make sure you both have a good time)  that it's a huge red flag.  So much so that in several instances I'm aware of that red flag, and all the shady, greedy, underhanded thieving and fraud led to jail time.  \n\nIt's ironic because often the hottest, most fun ones don't ask for the highest allowance necessarily.  It's the demanding, greedy, inattentive 7's and 8's that give SB's bad names......along with the flat out criminals.",

Ladies, this guy is full of sh*t, don\u2019t be scared to hold yourself to a certain standard and expect something in return.  Literally, by definition an arrangement IS a contract.

It's exactly that type of SB that is the most dangerous type.

And yes, 95 percent of guys I met are neither ugly fat nor rude.  I never said those things. But you\u2019re trying to project this image of seeking as a traditional dating website when it clearly is not. The website is seeking arrangement not seeking relationship. The whole appeal of an arrangement is that expectations are clear from the beginning, not blurred like in a traditional relationship.  I also completely reject the idea that \u201csome\u201d sugar babies go into this not expecting any sugar. Money is the distinguishing factor in an arrangement.  Otherwise many poor older men would do it. And sure, you can say network and mentorship is a factor but discretion is important usually and most men don\u2019t want their cover blown. So I would estimate less than 5% of women aren\u2019t looking for an allowance of any kind and that estimate is generous. That said, only \u201cvery few\u201d women aren\u2019t looking for an allowance, not \u201csome\u201d women.\n\nAnd to the deleted comment, I agree that few ppl use this in place of tinder, me included.  But the big difference is both parties here do expect to give/receive and allowance. To not expect to give one is just rude and those who don\u2019t expect to receive anything are probably unicorns.  To state blindly that SA is the same as tinder and bumble is dishonest and misleading.",

I've had 3 vanilla relationships off of SA, which wasn't the plan, but they may be in that 5% number you mentioned.  So I've been with more SB's that bypassed the allowance conversation, went out with me, and just wanted to date a BF who would spoil them, than any SB who demanded a strict arrangement.  That's an anomaly I get it but that was reality for me.\n\nOH plus the fact that the only typical SB situations I had ended up with criminal charges against both.  Fraud.  I don't need to be discreet or hide anything so there is no \"cover\" to be blown in my world, but I know SB's love it.  They love pitching \"discretion\" and \"secrecy\" because I know of too many of them that extort / blackmail married men as a criminal enterprise and plan it from the very beginning.  \n\nSA is an arrangement site plan and simple.  It's ok if people want to vanilla date after meeting there, after all that hurts no one!  What hurts people is having career criminals on there and the direct theft, extortion, & blackmail that is their goal.  I've met several that freely admit it and are proud of being thieves but almost always with married men.",

It's definitely not \"creating\" anything in the SD world, since I doubt it's been seen by the vast majority of them, but it certainly is pissing off the SB's.  You're an adult so just stand your ground if you think you're getting lowballed or find another vocation.  Maybe create a site focused on this and spread your version.....",

That proves nothing about your argument which I agree with.  Anything over 1K isn't a myth where are you getting that?  The format of the poll shows situations over 1K clearly (maybe not in the format you like).  I do know SB's in LV and LA that rarely get a 5k or 10k situation but those are exceptions not the rule.  They are also 10's / centerfold material as well.  Rates vary based on so many factors it's impossible to track, so if the poll isn't in the format you would prefer, and doesn't track sugaring the way you want to see it I would complain to the creators.",

But many SBs don\u2019t have this luxury.\nI think this subreddit is dangerously pigeonholing the experience and reducing it to literally the experience to a sexual act or \u201cmeet\u201d for a set amount of money.  It\u2019s just using different words for the same thing, which is prostitution.  But an arrangement can be so much more than just a per meet allowance. Doing this only promotes prostitution and sex trafficking. But I digress.",

Let's talk reality though......you stated (middle to upper class SD's that make 200 - 400K annually).  This is what cracks me up because I've had this conversation and seen SB's interviewed and answering simple questions broadcast all over the country......when a clearly \"motivated\" group of women were asked on a particular show (google it I don't recall the name) how much money a man MUST MAKE for income for her to be interested it ranged from $800K to *$20M* annually (1 outlier at $150K).  Huge swing right?   These women were 7's at best so they were in the top 30% appearance wise and by no means smoke shows  HOWEVER when the host shared with them that (depending on the state) that the top 1% of male earners make roughly $550K income they were stunned, yet did not care.    It's really simple actually SB's and SD's should date in their league which can be defined, and Fluid has mentioned that a few times since she's mentioning income.  So if a SD is in the top 2% of earners, then he should be looking for someone he thinks is in the top 2% of available women as well in terms of whatever he is looking for (i.e. physical appearance, intelligence, athleticism, kindness etc etc).  It's Simple.  If you want to be an elite SB you better know where you are on the spectrum (are you a 9 really?). and educate yourself as to the caliber of person you'll likely deal with.",

Are we talking about the warren buffet who is currently alive or one who existed and died in in the year 1912? (Btw, no I don\u2019t really mean the year 1912 it is called sarcasm)\n\nMoreover, while I am so mildly impressed that you are \u201cfrugal\u201d with your money\u2026ummm\u2026what are you expecting\u2026 a cookie? Because I\u2019m sorry, but I think I can confidently speak on behalf of all SBs that absolutely none of us are seeking a \u201cfrugal\u201d sd. You can try to spin this as \u201cbeing smart with money\u201d but wait actually NO, you actually cannot. Not with those amounts you are offering, sir b/c 150 per meet is too low, even for this survey (as it falls within the survey\u2019s minimum \u201cless than or equal to 300\u201d category).  That said, you\u2019re lucky that I\u2019m referring to you as \u201cfrugal\u201d b/c in reality, you\u2019re just cheap af. Sorry.\n\nAnd yes. I\u2019m sure there are many naive fresh 18 year olds that lack the confidence and self-respect to ask for more (and maybe there are older women as well) you are MISSING the freaking POINT, Sir.  Which is that this \u201csurvey\u201d does CONSTRUCTIVELY cap per meets at 1k\n\nAnd no, adding \u201c+\u201d at the end doesn\u2019t mean that the survey finds that 1k+ to be realistically within the data range of reference. In fact, I can confidentially say that anybody with a brain will interpret this data to mean that any amount above 1k (falling outside the corresponding reference region/range) are classified as \u201coutliers.\u201d  Which, considering inflation in the current financial economy, leads me to believe that the  moderators must have sugared back in the year 2003.",

I have vanilla dated gals I met on there, which was their idea not mine, with no allowance at all after a few dates.  So I went out with a bikini model for a few months for the price of dinners and a couple vacations.  Initially it was a k for a PM.  Not many sd's pull that move off.\n\n Like I stated above there are more and more sb's who are hurting all of you.

And yes, 95 percent of guys I met are neither ugly fat nor rude.  I never said those things. But you\u2019re trying to project this image of seeking as a traditional dating website when it clearly is not. The website is seeking arrangement not seeking relationship. The whole appeal of an arrangement is that expectations are clear from the beginning, not blurred like in a traditional relationship.  I also completely reject the idea that \u201csome\u201d sugar babies go into this not expecting any sugar. Money is the distinguishing factor in an arrangement.  Otherwise many poor older men would do it. And sure, you can say network and mentorship is a factor but discretion is important usually and most men don\u2019t want their cover blown. So I would estimate less than 5% of women aren\u2019t looking for an allowance of any kind and that estimate is generous. That said, only \u201cvery few\u201d women aren\u2019t looking for an allowance, not \u201csome\u201d women.\n\nAnd to the deleted comment, I agree that few ppl use this in place of tinder, me included.  But the big difference is both parties here do expect to give/receive and allowance. To not expect to give one is just rude and those who don\u2019t expect to receive anything are probably unicorns.  To state blindly that SA is the same as tinder and bumble is dishonest and misleading.",

I've had 3 vanilla relationships off of SA, which wasn't the plan, but they may be in that 5% number you mentioned.  So I've been with more SB's that bypassed the allowance conversation, went out with me, and just wanted to date a BF who would spoil them, than any SB who demanded a strict arrangement.  That's an anomaly I get it but that was reality for me.\n\nOH plus the fact that the only typical SB situations I had ended up with criminal charges against both.  Fraud.  I don't need to be discreet or hide anything so there is no \"cover\" to be blown in my world, but I know SB's love it.  They love pitching \"discretion\" and \"secrecy\" because I know of too many of them that extort / blackmail married men as a criminal enterprise and plan it from the very beginning.  \n\nSA is an arrangement site plan and simple.  It's ok if people want to vanilla date after meeting there, after all that hurts no one!  What hurts people is having career criminals on there and the direct theft, extortion, & blackmail that is their goal.

I only heard it once from a SB / Escort who went to Dubai for one night and said it was a 50K situation.  I can't confirm hence why I said myth but it wouldn't surprise me and is by no means normal.  That proves nothing about your argument which I agree with.  Anything over 1K isn't a myth where are you getting that?  The format of the poll shows situations over 1K clearly (maybe not in the format you like).  I do know SB's in LV and LA that rarely get a 5k or 10k situation but those are exceptions not the rule.  They are also 10's / centerfold material as well.  Rates vary based on so many factors it's impossible to track, so if the poll isn't in the format you would prefer, and doesn't track sugaring the way you want to see it I would complain to the creators.",

I refuse to accept and have not used the site in awhile because of this poll.

It\u2019s just using different words for the same thing, which is prostitution.  But an arrangement can be so much more than just a per meet allowance. Doing this only promotes prostitution and sex trafficking. But I digress.",

Let's talk reality though......you stated (middle to upper class SD's that make 200 - 400K annually).  This is what cracks me up because I've had this conversation and seen SB's interviewed and answering simple questions broadcast all over the country......when a clearly \"motivated\" group of women were asked on a particular show (google it I don't recall the name) how much money a man MUST MAKE for income for her to be interested it ranged from $800K to *$20M* annually (1 outlier at $150K).  Huge swing right?   These women were 7's at best so they were in the top 30% appearance wise and by no means smoke shows  HOWEVER when the host shared with them that (depending on the state) that the top 1% of male earners make roughly $550K income they were stunned, yet did not care.    It's really simple actually SB's and SD's should date in their league which can be defined, and Fluid has mentioned that a few times since she's mentioning income.  So if a SD is in the top 2% of earners, then he should be looking for someone he thinks is in the top 2% of available women as well in terms of whatever he is looking for (i.e. physical appearance, intelligence, athleticism, kindness etc etc).  It's Simple.  If you want to be an elite SB you better know where you are on the spectrum (are you a 9 really?). and educate yourself as to the caliber of person you'll likely deal with.",

I don\u2019t see how a family can live comfortably (I mean upper to middle class not middle class) without at least a combined income of 200k+.  A regular family residence in Cupertino or Los Altos costs around 6k-8k per month.  And it is said that rent shouldn\u2019t be more than 1/3 of your income. So you do the math.\n\nSo no, I\u2019m not throwing out random numbers. I don\u2019t even know how you tied looks in with this but you did.

I have vanilla dated gals I met on there, which was their idea not mine, with no allowance at all after a few dates.  So I went out with a bikini model for a few months for the price of dinners and a couple vacations.  Initially it was a k for a PM.  Not many sd's pull that move off.\n\n Like I stated above there are more and more sb's who are hurting all of you. They are so obsessed with their allowances, and constantly going on and on about money rather than doing what their sole purpose is (i.e. have fun and make sure you both have a good time)  that it's a huge red flag.  So much so that in several instances I'm aware of that red flag, and all the shady, greedy, underhanded thieving and fraud led to jail time.  \n\nIt's ironic because often the hottest, most fun ones don't ask for the highest allowance necessarily.  It's the demanding, greedy, inattentive 7's and 8's that give SB's bad names......along with the flat out criminals.",

If so, then why are the moderators pigeonholing allowance to a specific monetary amount?  \n\nI love how you reduce females to a number (beauty is very subjective btw) to argue this effed up logic that females have to expect nothing in return to be considered a \u201cgood\u201d 9/10 SB. Ladies, this guy is full of sh*t, don\u2019t be scared to hold yourself to a certain standard and expect something in return.  Literally, by definition an arrangement IS a contract.

It's not uncommon at all.  \n\nSpeaking from experience I can say that \"standards\" have nothing to do with being unrealistic asking for an arrangement,  that you deem a \"contract\",  up front before you even know each other.  It's exactly that type of SB that is the most dangerous type.  I'm very, very familiar with this type, and most are thieves / criminals, so if anyone encounters one that fits that mold I would bail immediately.  Run away...don't walk....not worth the hassle",

And yes, 95 percent of guys I met are neither ugly fat nor rude.  I never said those things. But you\u2019re trying to project this image of seeking as a traditional dating website when it clearly is not. The website is seeking arrangement not seeking relationship. The whole appeal of an arrangement is that expectations are clear from the beginning, not blurred like in a traditional relationship.  I also completely reject the idea that \u201csome\u201d sugar babies go into this not expecting any sugar. Money is the distinguishing factor in an arrangement.  Otherwise many poor older men would do it. And sure, you can say network and mentorship is a factor but discretion is important usually and most men don\u2019t want their cover blown. So I would estimate less than 5% of women aren\u2019t looking for an allowance of any kind and that estimate is generous. That said, only \u201cvery few\u201d women aren\u2019t looking for an allowance, not \u201csome\u201d women.\n\nAnd to the deleted comment, I agree that few ppl use this in place of tinder, me included.  But the big difference is both parties here do expect to give/receive and allowance. To not expect to give one is just rude and those who don\u2019t expect to receive anything are probably unicorns.  To state blindly that SA is the same as tinder and bumble is dishonest and misleading.",

I've had 3 vanilla relationships off of SA, which wasn't the plan, but they may be in that 5% number you mentioned.  So I've been with more SB's that bypassed the allowance conversation, went out with me, and just wanted to date a BF who would spoil them, than any SB who demanded a strict arrangement.  That's an anomaly I get it but that was reality for me.\n\nOH plus the fact that the only typical SB situations I had ended up with criminal charges against both.  Fraud.  I don't need to be discreet or hide anything so there is no \"cover\" to be blown in my world, but I know SB's love it.  They love pitching \"discretion\" and \"secrecy\" because I know of too many of them that extort / blackmail married men as a criminal enterprise and plan it from the very beginning.  \n\nSA is an arrangement site plan and simple.  It's ok if people want to vanilla date after meeting there, after all that hurts no one!  What hurts people is having career criminals on there and the direct theft, extortion, & blackmail that is their goal.  I've met several that freely admit it and are proud of being thieves but almost always with married men.",

That proves nothing about your argument which I agree with.  Anything over 1K isn't a myth where are you getting that?  The format of the poll shows situations over 1K clearly (maybe not in the format you like).  I do know SB's in LV and LA that rarely get a 5k or 10k situation but those are exceptions not the rule.  They are also 10's / centerfold material as well.  Rates vary based on so many factors it's impossible to track, so if the poll isn't in the format you would prefer, and doesn't track sugaring the way you want to see it I would complain to the creators.",

So\u2026yeah\u2026 it\u2019s moved the whole market where SBs are willing to accept lower numbers because guys refuse to pay more. I refuse to accept and have not used the site in awhile because of this poll.  But many SBs don\u2019t have this luxury.\nI think this subreddit is dangerously pigeonholing the experience and reducing it to literally the experience to a sexual act or \u201cmeet\u201d for a set amount of money.  It\u2019s just using different words for the same thing, which is prostitution.  But an arrangement can be so much more than just a per meet allowance. Doing this only promotes prostitution and sex trafficking. But I digress.",

Let's talk reality though......you stated (middle to upper class SD's that make 200 - 400K annually).  This is what cracks me up because I've had this conversation and seen SB's interviewed and answering simple questions broadcast all over the country......when a clearly \"motivated\" group of women were asked on a particular show (google it I don't recall the name) how much money a man MUST MAKE for income for her to be interested it ranged from $800K to *$20M* annually (1 outlier at $150K).  Huge swing right?   These women were 7's at best so they were in the top 30% appearance wise and by no means smoke shows  HOWEVER when the host shared with them that (depending on the state) that the top 1% of male earners make roughly $550K income they were stunned, yet did not care.    It's really simple actually SB's and SD's should date in their league which can be defined, and Fluid has mentioned that a few times since she's mentioning income.  So if a SD is in the top 2% of earners, then he should be looking for someone he thinks is in the top 2% of available women as well in terms of whatever he is looking for (i.e. physical appearance, intelligence, athleticism, kindness etc etc).  It's Simple.  If you want to be an elite SB you better know where you are on the spectrum (are you a 9 really?). and educate yourself as to the caliber of person you'll likely deal with.",

A regular family residence in Cupertino or Los Altos costs around 6k-8k per month.  And it is said that rent shouldn\u2019t be more than 1/3 of your income.

If so, then why are the moderators pigeonholing allowance to a specific monetary amount?  \n\nI love how you reduce females to a number (beauty is very subjective btw) to argue this effed up logic that females have to expect nothing in return to be considered a \u201cgood\u201d 9/10 SB. Ladies, this guy is full of sh*t, don\u2019t be scared to hold yourself to a certain standard and expect something in return.  Literally, by definition an arrangement IS a contract.

It's not uncommon at all.  \n\nSpeaking from experience I can say that \"standards\" have nothing to do with being unrealistic asking for an arrangement,  that you deem a \"contract\",  up front before you even know each other.  It's exactly that type of SB that is the most dangerous type.  I'm very, very familiar with this type, and most are thieves / criminals, so if anyone encounters one that fits that mold I would bail immediately.  Run away...don't walk....not worth the hassle",

And yes, 95 percent of guys I met are neither ugly fat nor rude.  I never said those things. But you\u2019re trying to project this image of seeking as a traditional dating website when it clearly is not. The website is seeking arrangement not seeking relationship. The whole appeal of an arrangement is that expectations are clear from the beginning, not blurred like in a traditional relationship.  I also completely reject the idea that \u201csome\u201d sugar babies go into this not expecting any sugar. Money is the distinguishing factor in an arrangement.  Otherwise many poor older men would do it. And sure, you can say network and mentorship is a factor but discretion is important usually and most men don\u2019t want their cover blown. So I would estimate less than 5% of women aren\u2019t looking for an allowance of any kind and that estimate is generous. That said, only \u201cvery few\u201d women aren\u2019t looking for an allowance, not \u201csome\u201d women.\n\nAnd to the deleted comment, I agree that few ppl use this in place of tinder, me included.  But the big difference is both parties here do expect to give/receive and allowance. To not expect to give one is just rude and those who don\u2019t expect to receive anything are probably unicorns.  To state blindly that SA is the same as tinder and bumble is dishonest and misleading.",

I've had 3 vanilla relationships off of SA, which wasn't the plan, but they may be in that 5% number you mentioned.  So I've been with more SB's that bypassed the allowance conversation, went out with me, and just wanted to date a BF who would spoil them, than any SB who demanded a strict arrangement.  That's an anomaly I get it but that was reality for me.\n\nOH plus the fact that the only typical SB situations I had ended up with criminal charges against both.  Fraud.  I don't need to be discreet or hide anything so there is no \"cover\" to be blown in my world, but I know SB's love it.  They love pitching \"discretion\" and \"secrecy\" because I know of too many of them that extort / blackmail married men as a criminal enterprise and plan it from the very beginning.  \n\nSA is an arrangement site plan and simple.  It's ok if people want to vanilla date after meeting there, after all that hurts no one!  What hurts people is having career criminals on there and the direct theft, extortion, & blackmail that is their goal.  I've met several that freely admit it and are proud of being thieves but almost always with married men.",

That proves nothing about your argument which I agree with.  Anything over 1K isn't a myth where are you getting that?  The format of the poll shows situations over 1K clearly (maybe not in the format you like).  I do know SB's in LV and LA that rarely get a 5k or 10k situation but those are exceptions not the rule.  They are also 10's / centerfold material as well.  Rates vary based on so many factors it's impossible to track, so if the poll isn't in the format you would prefer, and doesn't track sugaring the way you want to see it I would complain to the creators.",

So\u2026yeah\u2026 it\u2019s moved the whole market where SBs are willing to accept lower numbers because guys refuse to pay more. I refuse to accept and have not used the site in awhile because of this poll.  But many SBs don\u2019t have this luxury.\nI think this subreddit is dangerously pigeonholing the experience and reducing it to literally the experience to a sexual act or \u201cmeet\u201d for a set amount of money.  It\u2019s just using different words for the same thing, which is prostitution.  But an arrangement can be so much more than just a per meet allowance. Doing this only promotes prostitution and sex trafficking. But I digress.",

Let's talk reality though......you stated (middle to upper class SD's that make 200 - 400K annually).  This is what cracks me up because I've had this conversation and seen SB's interviewed and answering simple questions broadcast all over the country......when a clearly \"motivated\" group of women were asked on a particular show (google it I don't recall the name) how much money a man MUST MAKE for income for her to be interested it ranged from $800K to *$20M* annually (1 outlier at $150K).  Huge swing right?   These women were 7's at best so they were in the top 30% appearance wise and by no means smoke shows  HOWEVER when the host shared with them that (depending on the state) that the top 1% of male earners make roughly $550K income they were stunned, yet did not care.    It's really simple actually SB's and SD's should date in their league which can be defined, and Fluid has mentioned that a few times since she's mentioning income.  So if a SD is in the top 2% of earners, then he should be looking for someone he thinks is in the top 2% of available women as well in terms of whatever he is looking for (i.e. physical appearance, intelligence, athleticism, kindness etc etc).  It's Simple.  If you want to be an elite SB you better know where you are on the spectrum (are you a 9 really?). and educate yourself as to the caliber of person you'll likely deal with.",

I\u2019ll give you the benefit of the doubt and try my best to believe that girls who are 9/10 and 30 years younger actually like you\u2026and expect absolutely \u201cnothing\u201d in return\u2026 despite the fact they are on SA.  But it\u2019s more a credit to their lack of experience in the bowl and NOT b/c they prefer irrelevant 40 to 50 year olds.  If you think a 20 year old Instagram model actually prefers to hangout with a guy her dads age on a Saturday night in public just for kicks and giggles you might be delusional. \n\nYes, I agree all arrangements are different and not just sex for pay.  If so, then why are the moderators pigeonholing allowance to a specific monetary amount?  \n\nI love how you reduce females to a number (beauty is very subjective btw) to argue this effed up logic that females have to expect nothing in return to be considered a \u201cgood\u201d 9/10 SB. Ladies, this guy is full of sh*t, don\u2019t be scared to hold yourself to a certain standard and expect something in return.  Literally, by definition an arrangement IS a contract.  An arrangement must be mutually beneficial. Any guy who expects you to expect nothing is not worth your time.  Money is just a short convo. \n\nAnd to put females who have standards in the same category as those who thieve and assault guys is just unfair.",

It's not uncommon at all.  \n\nSpeaking from experience I can say that \"standards\" have nothing to do with being unrealistic asking for an arrangement,  that you deem a \"contract\",  up front before you even know each other.  It's exactly that type of SB that is the most dangerous type.  I'm very, very familiar with this type, and most are thieves / criminals, so if anyone encounters one that fits that mold I would bail immediately.  Run away...don't walk....not worth the hassle",

And yes, 95 percent of guys I met are neither ugly fat nor rude.  I never said those things. But you\u2019re trying to project this image of seeking as a traditional dating website when it clearly is not. The website is seeking arrangement not seeking relationship. The whole appeal of an arrangement is that expectations are clear from the beginning, not blurred like in a traditional relationship.  I also completely reject the idea that \u201csome\u201d sugar babies go into this not expecting any sugar. Money is the distinguishing factor in an arrangement.  Otherwise many poor older men would do it. And sure, you can say network and mentorship is a factor but discretion is important usually and most men don\u2019t want their cover blown. So I would estimate less than 5% of women aren\u2019t looking for an allowance of any kind and that estimate is generous. That said, only \u201cvery few\u201d women aren\u2019t looking for an allowance, not \u201csome\u201d women.\n\nAnd to the deleted comment, I agree that few ppl use this in place of tinder, me included.  But the big difference is both parties here do expect to give/receive and allowance. To not expect to give one is just rude and those who don\u2019t expect to receive anything are probably unicorns.  To state blindly that SA is the same as tinder and bumble is dishonest and misleading.",

I've had 3 vanilla relationships off of SA, which wasn't the plan, but they may be in that 5% number you mentioned.  So I've been with more SB's that bypassed the allowance conversation, went out with me, and just wanted to date a BF who would spoil them, than any SB who demanded a strict arrangement.  That's an anomaly I get it but that was reality for me.\n\nOH plus the fact that the only typical SB situations I had ended up with criminal charges against both.  Fraud.  I don't need to be discreet or hide anything so there is no \"cover\" to be blown in my world, but I know SB's love it.  They love pitching \"discretion\" and \"secrecy\" because I know of too many of them that extort / blackmail married men as a criminal enterprise and plan it from the very beginning.  \n\nSA is an arrangement site plan and simple.  It's ok if people want to vanilla date after meeting there, after all that hurts no one!  What hurts people is having career criminals on there and the direct theft, extortion, & blackmail that is their goal.

That proves nothing about your argument which I agree with.  Anything over 1K isn't a myth where are you getting that?  The format of the poll shows situations over 1K clearly (maybe not in the format you like).  I do know SB's in LV and LA that rarely get a 5k or 10k situation but those are exceptions not the rule.  They are also 10's / centerfold material as well.  Rates vary based on so many factors it's impossible to track, so if the poll isn't in the format you would prefer, and doesn't track sugaring the way you want to see it I would complain to the creators.",

I refuse to accept and have not used the site in awhile because of this poll.  But many SBs don\u2019t have this luxury.\nI think this subreddit is dangerously pigeonholing the experience and reducing it to literally the experience to a sexual act or \u201cmeet\u201d for a set amount of money.  It\u2019s just using different words for the same thing, which is prostitution.  But an arrangement can be so much more than just a per meet allowance. Doing this only promotes prostitution and sex trafficking. But I digress.",

Let's talk reality though......you stated (middle to upper class SD's that make 200 - 400K annually).  This is what cracks me up because I've had this conversation and seen SB's interviewed and answering simple questions broadcast all over the country......when a clearly \"motivated\" group of women were asked on a particular show (google it I don't recall the name) how much money a man MUST MAKE for income for her to be interested it ranged from $800K to *$20M* annually (1 outlier at $150K).  Huge swing right?   These women were 7's at best so they were in the top 30% appearance wise and by no means smoke shows  HOWEVER when the host shared with them that (depending on the state) that the top 1% of male earners make roughly $550K income they were stunned, yet did not care.    It's really simple actually SB's and SD's should date in their league which can be defined, and Fluid has mentioned that a few times since she's mentioning income.  So if a SD is in the top 2% of earners, then he should be looking for someone he thinks is in the top 2% of available women as well in terms of whatever he is looking for (i.e. physical appearance, intelligence, athleticism, kindness etc etc).  It's Simple.  If you want to be an elite SB you better know where you are on the spectrum (are you a 9 really?). and educate yourself as to the caliber of person you'll likely deal with.",

And yes, 95 percent of guys I met are neither ugly fat nor rude.  I never said those things. But you\u2019re trying to project this image of seeking as a traditional dating website when it clearly is not. The website is seeking arrangement not seeking relationship. The whole appeal of an arrangement is that expectations are clear from the beginning, not blurred like in a traditional relationship.  I also completely reject the idea that \u201csome\u201d sugar babies go into this not expecting any sugar. Money is the distinguishing factor in an arrangement.  Otherwise many poor older men would do it. And sure, you can say network and mentorship is a factor but discretion is important usually and most men don\u2019t want their cover blown. So I would estimate less than 5% of women aren\u2019t looking for an allowance of any kind and that estimate is generous. That said, only \u201cvery few\u201d women aren\u2019t looking for an allowance, not \u201csome\u201d women.\n\nAnd to the deleted comment, I agree that few ppl use this in place of tinder, me included.  But the big difference is both parties here do expect to give/receive and allowance. To not expect to give one is just rude and those who don\u2019t expect to receive anything are probably unicorns.  To state blindly that SA is the same as tinder and bumble is dishonest and misleading.",

I've had 3 vanilla relationships off of SA, which wasn't the plan, but they may be in that 5% number you mentioned.  So I've been with more SB's that bypassed the allowance conversation, went out with me, and just wanted to date a BF who would spoil them, than any SB who demanded a strict arrangement.  That's an anomaly I get it but that was reality for me.\n\nOH plus the fact that the only typical SB situations I had ended up with criminal charges against both.  Fraud.  I don't need to be discreet or hide anything so there is no \"cover\" to be blown in my world, but I know SB's love it.  They love pitching \"discretion\" and \"secrecy\" because I know of too many of them that extort / blackmail married men as a criminal enterprise and plan it from the very beginning.  \n\nSA is an arrangement site plan and simple.  It's ok if people want to vanilla date after meeting there, after all that hurts no one!  What hurts people is having career criminals on there and the direct theft, extortion, & blackmail that is their goal.  I've met several that freely admit it and are proud of being thieves but almost always with married men.",

That proves nothing about your argument which I agree with.  Anything over 1K isn't a myth where are you getting that?  The format of the poll shows situations over 1K clearly (maybe not in the format you like).  I do know SB's in LV and LA that rarely get a 5k or 10k situation but those are exceptions not the rule.  They are also 10's / centerfold material as well.  Rates vary based on so many factors it's impossible to track, so if the poll isn't in the format you would prefer, and doesn't track sugaring the way you want to see it I would complain to the creators.",

So\u2026yeah\u2026 it\u2019s moved the whole market where SBs are willing to accept lower numbers because guys refuse to pay more. I refuse to accept and have not used the site in awhile because of this poll.  But many SBs don\u2019t have this luxury.\nI think this subreddit is dangerously pigeonholing the experience and reducing it to literally the experience to a sexual act or \u201cmeet\u201d for a set amount of money.  It\u2019s just using different words for the same thing, which is prostitution.  But an arrangement can be so much more than just a per meet allowance. Doing this only promotes prostitution and sex trafficking. But I digress.",

Let's talk reality though......you stated (middle to upper class SD's that make 200 - 400K annually).  This is what cracks me up because I've had this conversation and seen SB's interviewed and answering simple questions broadcast all over the country......when a clearly \"motivated\" group of women were asked on a particular show (google it I don't recall the name) how much money a man MUST MAKE for income for her to be interested it ranged from $800K to *$20M* annually (1 outlier at $150K).  Huge swing right?   These women were 7's at best so they were in the top 30% appearance wise and by no means smoke shows  HOWEVER when the host shared with them that (depending on the state) that the top 1% of male earners make roughly $550K income they were stunned, yet did not care.    It's really simple actually SB's and SD's should date in their league which can be defined, and Fluid has mentioned that a few times since she's mentioning income.  So if a SD is in the top 2% of earners, then he should be looking for someone he thinks is in the top 2% of available women as well in terms of whatever he is looking for (i.e. physical appearance, intelligence, athleticism, kindness etc etc).  It's Simple.  If you want to be an elite SB you better know where you are on the spectrum (are you a 9 really?). and educate yourself as to the caliber of person you'll likely deal with.",

I don\u2019t see how a family can live comfortably (I mean upper to middle class not middle class) without at least a combined income of 200k+.  A regular family residence in Cupertino or Los Altos costs around 6k-8k per month.  And it is said that rent shouldn\u2019t be more than 1/3 of your income.

And yes, 95 percent of guys I met are neither ugly fat nor rude.  I never said those things. But you\u2019re trying to project this image of seeking as a traditional dating website when it clearly is not. The website is seeking arrangement not seeking relationship. The whole appeal of an arrangement is that expectations are clear from the beginning, not blurred like in a traditional relationship.  I also completely reject the idea that \u201csome\u201d sugar babies go into this not expecting any sugar. Money is the distinguishing factor in an arrangement.  Otherwise many poor older men would do it. And sure, you can say network and mentorship is a factor but discretion is important usually and most men don\u2019t want their cover blown. So I would estimate less than 5% of women aren\u2019t looking for an allowance of any kind and that estimate is generous. That said, only \u201cvery few\u201d women aren\u2019t looking for an allowance, not \u201csome\u201d women.\n\nAnd to the deleted comment, I agree that few ppl use this in place of tinder, me included.  But the big difference is both parties here do expect to give/receive and allowance. To not expect to give one is just rude and those who don\u2019t expect to receive anything are probably unicorns.  To state blindly that SA is the same as tinder and bumble is dishonest and misleading.",

I've had 3 vanilla relationships off of SA, which wasn't the plan, but they may be in that 5% number you mentioned.  So I've been with more SB's that bypassed the allowance conversation, went out with me, and just wanted to date a BF who would spoil them, than any SB who demanded a strict arrangement.  That's an anomaly I get it but that was reality for me.\n\nOH plus the fact that the only typical SB situations I had ended up with criminal charges against both.  Fraud.  I don't need to be discreet or hide anything so there is no \"cover\" to be blown in my world, but I know SB's love it.  They love pitching \"discretion\" and \"secrecy\" because I know of too many of them that extort / blackmail married men as a criminal enterprise and plan it from the very beginning.  \n\nSA is an arrangement site plan and simple.  It's ok if people want to vanilla date after meeting there, after all that hurts no one!  What hurts people is having career criminals on there and the direct theft, extortion, & blackmail that is their goal.  I've met several that freely admit it and are proud of being thieves but almost always with married men.",

I think the past 7-8 SDs (out of 8-9 SDs) I\u2019m spoken to tell me their max is exactly the max amount capped in this poll. So\u2026yeah\u2026 it\u2019s moved the whole market where SBs are willing to accept lower numbers because guys refuse to pay more. I refuse to accept and have not used the site in awhile because of this poll.  But many SBs don\u2019t have this luxury.\nI think this subreddit is dangerously pigeonholing the experience and reducing it to literally the experience to a sexual act or \u201cmeet\u201d for a set amount of money.  It\u2019s just using different words for the same thing, which is prostitution.  But an arrangement can be so much more than just a per meet allowance. Doing this only promotes prostitution and sex trafficking. But I digress.",

I don\u2019t see how a family can live comfortably (I mean upper to middle class not middle class) without at least a combined income of 200k+.  A regular family residence in Cupertino or Los Altos costs around 6k-8k per month.  And it is said that rent shouldn\u2019t be more than 1/3 of your income. So you do the math.\n\nSo no, I\u2019m not throwing out random numbers. I don\u2019t even know how you tied looks in with this but you did.  Although unnecessary but it seems like you\u2019re trying to insinuate that I\u2019m average looking or less than.

I can't confirm hence why I said myth but it wouldn't surprise me and is by no means normal.  That proves nothing about your argument which I agree with.  Anything over 1K isn't a myth where are you getting that?  The format of the poll shows situations over 1K clearly (maybe not in the format you like).  I do know SB's in LV and LA that rarely get a 5k or 10k situation but those are exceptions not the rule.  They are also 10's / centerfold material as well.  Rates vary based on so many factors it's impossible to track, so if the poll isn't in the format you would prefer, and doesn't track sugaring the way you want to see it I would complain to the creators.",

            "body": "Seeking clearly isn't a traditional dating site, but once again I can only speak from my experience which has been ending up in a few vanilla relationships with SB's.  I've had 3 vanilla relationships off of SA, which wasn't the plan, but they may be in that 5% number you mentioned.  So I've been with more SB's that bypassed the allowance conversation, went out with me, and just wanted to date a BF who would spoil them, than any SB who demanded a strict arrangement.  That's an anomaly I get it but that was reality for me.\n\nOH plus the fact that the only typical SB situations I had ended up with criminal charges against both.  Fraud.  I don't need to be discreet or hide anything so there is no \"cover\" to be blown in my world, but I know SB's love it.  They love pitching \"discretion\" and \"secrecy\" because I know of too many of them that extort / blackmail married men as a criminal enterprise and plan it from the very beginning.  \n\nSA is an arrangement site plan and simple.  It's ok if people want to vanilla date after meeting there, after all that hurts no one!  What hurts people is having career criminals on there and the direct theft, extortion, & blackmail that is their goal.  I've met several that freely admit it and are proud of being thieves but almost always with married men.",
