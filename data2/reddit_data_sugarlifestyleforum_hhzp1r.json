    "body": "RANT: I\u2019ve been seeing many posts that are concerning. Some regarding what a new SB should do if her POT asks ...., some posts of unfortunate outcomes, some posts about being rinsed. IMHO, if it\u2019s something that you wouldn\u2019t do in a vanilla situation then there is no need to run risks and do it for the sake of a POT SR.\nNo one would give their bank information to anyone on a first date in the vanilla world. No one would fly away with a stranger to an Arab country (or any country) in the Vanilla world.\nI could go on and on. Things get very skewed when money is involved, so when you\u2019re trying to decide if the action/ behavior is safe ...just mentally remove the money aspect and see if you\u2019d still follow through. Nutshell here is, please be informed and always put your safety first.\nMuch love and luck to all!\n\u2764\ufe0f",

At least this way they will protect themselves more prudently, the way that most high end escorts seem to protect themselves.",

I could go on and on about the stereotypes that ladies hold about sugar vs vanilla but we all know what they are. One example is it is perfectly normal for the lady to support her vanilla partner financially or date losers in the vanilla world, just saying! \n\nThese stereotypes end up driving risky behavior from SBs and then many get hurt and those rants end up on SLF in the form of SD shaming/bashing posts.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things I would advise SBs to exercise caution and care but I don\u2019t honestly know what makes them so desperate for money that they will indulge in such risky behavior. It\u2019s easy for well off SDs to advise them but I don\u2019t really know the real financial struggles of these ladies particularly in these times.",
