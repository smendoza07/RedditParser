I get your point, but I don't think wearing makeup and wearing fake hair are in the same ballpark. \n\nEdit: And I'll apply that standard to women too - wigs, weaves, hair extensions - I think it's the weirdest shit.

Yes women should be less punitive and superficial, but they're largely socially and biologically conditioned to be so.  Men are not.  I get your point, but I don't think wearing makeup and wearing fake hair are in the same ballpark. \n\nEdit: And I'll apply that standard to women too - wigs, weaves, hair extensions - I think it's the weirdest shit.

If I did, you're right, it would be in the hopes of feeling attractive or confident.  But that's not what men do, because it's not what women are attracted to.  Yes women should be less punitive and superficial, but they're largely socially and biologically conditioned to be so.  Men are not.  I get your point, but I don't think wearing makeup and wearing fake hair are in the same ballpark. \n\nEdit: And I'll apply that standard to women too - wigs, weaves, hair extensions - I think it's the weirdest shit.
