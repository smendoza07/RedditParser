    "body": "I've been in and out of this lifestyle for several years. I'm not extremely experienced but I'm definitely not new either. But this is a first for me (and the first time I really thought the scenario through).\n\nMost of us are aware that 1) we don't always know or get to know the man's identity the first time we have intimacy with him). 2) we can usually (not always) figure out his identity by the address he lives at if he asks us to come over\n\nThanks to one particular POT who's words raised the hairs on my arms, I am now made aware that some men rent Airbnb instead of a hotel for their trysts.\n\nThis is what I want to share with all the SBs and newbies: **please please do not go meet a guy at an Airbnb until you know who he is / until trust is established.** At a hotel, there are security cameras and footages, there are ID checks, there is frontdesk staff available and on-call. That is NOT the case at Airbnb and oftentimes Airbnb does not even have the IDs of their customers.\n\nI met him for M&G, and because of this and other reasons, I did not proceed to subsequent dates with him. If he doesn't share his identity, I'd at least want to feel safer at a hotel. An Airbnb is much less safe compared to a hotel.",

There weren't really any other yellow or red flags.   \n\n\nI just had a gut feeling that Airbnb isn't the best place. I've only rented Airbnb with family. The lack of security cameras/footage/ID checks and all that other safety measures didn't really register in my mind until I did a gut check.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd you're 100% right, I mean, no place is safe if there are other things going on.

There is already a substantial power differential to begin with and as a woman, that can be a very vulnerable position to be in. A man has more strength, resources, and connections to do us harm and get away with it. So having his info but him not having all of hers gives some women a sense of an \u2018even playing field\u2019.\n\nIt\u2019s not that you\u2019re a bad guy, but there are a lot of bad men out there who want to hurt us or stalk us. Many of the women on SA have been in abusive relationships where giving our their info too early made them really vulnerable. Many also have minor children at home and protecting them is non-negotiable.\n\nIf I may ask, what information do you request and how early in the arrangement are you generally requesting it?",

But ironically, I was thinking about shifting to Airbnb for my next SB for two reasons:\n\n1. Everyone says how much more homey and less escorty than a hotel can feel.  I've seen many SBs here remark about that.\n2. Hotels regularly show up as one of the most high-risk places you can go, covid-wise.  Right behind indoor bars & restaurants, family gatherings, the airport during a holiday -- hotels are the very next, very high risk thing mentioned.  I've been navigating this by picking hotels with lots of vacancies, low-contact check-in methods, spend no time in the common areas.\n\nThat said, if it really is as you say, that Airbnb doesn't really even have the identity of the renter, it's certainly the riskiest of all.  I'm just surprised the don't have a \"know your customer\" requirement for themselves.",

But if you google \"places with highest coronavirus risk\", hotels always show up in the top 4 or 5.  \n\nHere's one story  [https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/11/10/coronavirus-restaurants-gyms-hotels-risk/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/11/10/coronavirus-restaurants-gyms-hotels-risk/)   But there's a zillion more hits, so if you don't like that news source or that particular study, find another, there's plenty of other studies and news sources.\n\nThat said, it doesn't seem like the study in that story, or even most studies, can definitively say \"these people caught covid in the hotel\".   Maybe it's because people who are at a hotel are more likely to go to a restaurant or bar, or be socializing with their co-travelers, and that's where they got it?  But hotel always does float up to the top, foro whatever reason",

From this thread, it sounds like there may be loopholes, but if you're not actively trying to hide from them, you can expect them to know who you are.\n\nYou're right that it's homier and more pandemic-safe than a hotel. It'll be just you, no staff, no guests, no common areas. \n\nMy thought is it could be a great option, and you should just think through how you can make the situation safer & more trustworthy for her. Have her arrive first with her own transportation, text her a photo of your drivers license that proves you are who you say you are, etc. And once you do have trust with her, I think Airbnbs won't be problematic at all.",

In fact I'd go further and say, if Airbnb doesn't even know who its customers are, I think any home/apartment/etc owner would be insane to put their place up for rent.   They have no idea who their customer is, and those people are going into my home???\n\nu/ExExpectations said she signed up for Airbnb with no ID or anything else needed.  Could there be an extra verification step if you actually try to use the service to book a place?  I mean, I signed up for  Coinbase with nothing but a fake email and password.  It wasn't until I tried to do a transaction that I needed to send in all manner of ID.  Same with cashapp, more verification as I tried to do more things on the app.  Layered ID requirements make sense -- make it super easy for the customer to sign up for the app, get them invested, and don't drop the verification requirements on them until they get excited to use the service",

But if you google \"places with highest coronavirus risk\", hotels always show up in the top 4 or 5.  \n\nHere's one story  [https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/11/10/coronavirus-restaurants-gyms-hotels-risk/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/11/10/coronavirus-restaurants-gyms-hotels-risk/)   But there's a zillion more hits, so if you don't like that news source or that particular study, find another, there's plenty of other studies and news sources.\n\nThat said, it doesn't seem like the study in that story, or even most studies, can definitively say \"these people caught covid in the hotel\".   Maybe it's because people who are at a hotel are more likely to go to a restaurant or bar, or be socializing with their co-travelers, and that's where they got it?  But hotel always does float up to the top, foro whatever reason",

In fact I'd go further and say, if Airbnb doesn't even know who its customers are, I think any home/apartment/etc owner would be insane to put their place up for rent.   They have no idea who their customer is, and those people are going into my home???\n\nu/ExExpectations said she signed up for Airbnb with no ID or anything else needed.  Could there be an extra verification step if you actually try to use the service to book a place?  I mean, I signed up for  Coinbase with nothing but a fake email and password.  It wasn't until I tried to do a transaction that I needed to send in all manner of ID.  Same with cashapp, more verification as I tried to do more things on the app.  Layered ID requirements make sense -- make it super easy for the customer to sign up for the app, get them invested, and don't drop the verification requirements on them until they get excited to use the service",

Maybe it's because people who are at a hotel are more likely to go to a restaurant or bar, or be socializing with their co-travelers, and that's where they got it?  But hotel always does float up to the top, foro whatever reason",

They have no idea who their customer is, and those people are going into my home???\n\nu/ExExpectations said she signed up for Airbnb with no ID or anything else needed.  Could there be an extra verification step if you actually try to use the service to book a place?  I mean, I signed up for  Coinbase with nothing but a fake email and password.  It wasn't until I tried to do a transaction that I needed to send in all manner of ID.  Same with cashapp, more verification as I tried to do more things on the app.  Layered ID requirements make sense -- make it super easy for the customer to sign up for the app, get them invested, and don't drop the verification requirements on them until they get excited to use the service",

I did not upload any IDs to my profile and have booked years prior. \n\nThe point of my post was, compared to a hotel: there is NO security cameras in place, NO staff on call, literally no one around except the two people. At a hotel, there are usually other customers too. \n\nAll those are much more important to the SB compared to the ID issue yet somehow y\u2019all get stuck on that part. \n\nLastly, I\u2019ve dealt with Airbnb CS before -\nas another commenter said - not the most awesome CS experiences. It\u2019s also a private entity (IN A PRIVATE HOME) compared to many hotel chains where more visibility are present.\n\nIf a guy insists he always and would rather use Airbnb rather than hotel (even as the first / few times), it\u2019s NOT OKAY. \n\nMy post is to warn other SBs to watch out for this as a red flag.  I was feeling uneasy. But couldn\u2019t pinpoint exactly why. I wouldn\u2019t have thought as thoroughly had it not for another redditor who questioned it as well.",

With the exception of thinking through the covid sitch, it'd be a no brainer for me to do just pick whichever an SB preferred.\n\nIt's a good point about no staff on call,  no cameras, etc.  But for SBs who go to their SD's house -- which is obviously not the recommended way for the first few meetings -- it's the same situation.  To the extent there's any saving grace about the house, it's that since you know where his house is, you can figure out his identity.  That's what we're debating for Airbnb also... can you figure out his identity?  This isn't an arguing with your initial point, but now we want to figure out the answer.",

At a hotel, there are usually other customers too. \n\nAll those are much more important to the SB compared to the ID issue yet somehow y\u2019all get stuck on that part. \n\nLastly, I\u2019ve dealt with Airbnb CS before -\nas another commenter said - not the most awesome CS experiences. It\u2019s also a private entity (IN A PRIVATE HOME) compared to many hotel chains where more visibility are present.\n\nIf a guy insists he always and would rather use Airbnb rather than hotel (even as the first / few times), it\u2019s NOT OKAY. \n\nMy post is to warn other SBs to watch out for this as a red flag.  I was feeling uneasy. But couldn\u2019t pinpoint exactly why. I wouldn\u2019t have thought as thoroughly had it not for another redditor who questioned it as well.",

To the extent there's any saving grace about the house, it's that since you know where his house is, you can figure out his identity.  That's what we're debating for Airbnb also... can you figure out his identity?  This isn't an arguing with your initial point, but now we want to figure out the answer.",

With the exception of thinking through the covid sitch, it'd be a no brainer for me to do just pick whichever an SB preferred.\n\nIt's a good point about no staff on call,  no cameras, etc.  But for SBs who go to their SD's house -- which is obviously not the recommended way for the first few meetings -- it's the same situation.  To the extent there's any saving grace about the house, it's that since you know where his house is, you can figure out his identity.  That's what we're debating for Airbnb also... can you figure out his identity?  This isn't an arguing with your initial point, but now we want to figure out the answer.",
