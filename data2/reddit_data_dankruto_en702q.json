Bonding chakra is superior than leeching from it. The trade off is the biijuu and host must as one share the responsibility and risk hence why Naruto was forbidden from releasing the seal to free kurama  but on the flip side raised his \"powerlvl\" from kage to bijuu therefore could fought off Obito and his 6 bijuus. \n\nhttps://elechimezzoflation.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/naruto-2992345.jpg\n\nSasuke on the otherhand is bijuu lvl without sharing any cooperation, they are merely a tool from his new eyes to his ninjutsu and will only be as good as he is therefore his threshold is limited. With all that said, If Naruto was to fight alone and leech kurama like he's always done before opening the seal, then even with his six paths mode he'll be inferior to rinne-Sasuke. This also indirectly explains why later Sasuke was able to keep up with adult Naruto against Momoshiki.",

Bonding chakra is superior than leeching from it. The trade off is the biijuu and host must as one share the responsibility and risk hence why Naruto was forbidden from releasing the seal to free kurama  but on the flip side raised his \"powerlvl\" from kage to bijuu therefore could fought off Obito and his 6 bijuus. \n\nhttps://elechimezzoflation.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/naruto-2992345.jpg\n\nSasuke on the otherhand is bijuu lvl without sharing any cooperation, they are merely a tool from his new eyes to his ninjutsu and will only be as good as he is therefore his threshold is limited. With all that said, If Naruto was to fight alone and leech kurama like he's always done before opening the seal, then even with his six paths mode he'll be inferior to rinne-Sasuke. This also indirectly explains why later Sasuke was able to keep up with adult Naruto against Momoshiki.",

Bonding chakra is superior than leeching from it. The trade off is the biijuu and host must as one share the responsibility and risk hence why Naruto was forbidden from releasing the seal to free kurama  but on the flip side raised his \"powerlvl\" from kage to bijuu therefore could fought off Obito and his 6 bijuus. \n\nhttps://elechimezzoflation.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/naruto-2992345.jpg\n\nSasuke on the otherhand is bijuu lvl without sharing any cooperation, they are merely a tool from his new eyes to his ninjutsu and will only be as good as he is therefore his threshold is limited. With all that said, If Naruto was to fight alone and leech kurama like he's always done before opening the seal, then even with his six paths mode he'll be inferior to rinne-Sasuke. This also indirectly explains why later Sasuke was able to keep up with adult Naruto against Momoshiki.",
