And the instant noodles is because well you know, he loves ramen and it's cheap not to mention easy to prepare lol",

At least as an infant he would have been in some sort of care/group home with other orphans, so he would've been being taken care of, but whether out of spite or just because there wasn't enough resources to devote to each child, he was probably emotionally neglected. The adults probably shunned him as much as they could get away with, and the other kids would've picked up on this and shunned him as well. Emotional neglect can lead to a host of behavioral issues, which would've exasperated Natuto's social situation further, so it's not a stretch to say he was probably given his own private living quarters as soon as he could start acting more independently, and just having a rotation of guards to make sure he's safe and has all of his necessities. So he had enough interaction as a baby/toddler/child to recieve the learning he needed, he just wasn't able to develop close positive relationships (except with a few people here and there). Hiruzen would've made sure his physical needs were taken care of, but he can't force anyone to have a positive emotional relationship with Naruto (and he probably would've recieved a lot of public backlash, perhaps enough to endanger Naruto's life, if he were to have a close familial relationship with him). But that's just my take on it, someone who hasn't been up to date with the fandom for many years.",

At least as an infant he would have been in some sort of care/group home with other orphans, so he would've been being taken care of, but whether out of spite or just because there wasn't enough resources to devote to each child, he was probably emotionally neglected. The adults probably shunned him as much as they could get away with, and the other kids would've picked up on this and shunned him as well. Emotional neglect can lead to a host of behavioral issues, which would've exasperated Natuto's social situation further, so it's not a stretch to say he was probably given his own private living quarters as soon as he could start acting more independently, and just having a rotation of guards to make sure he's safe and has all of his necessities. So he had enough interaction as a baby/toddler/child to recieve the learning he needed, he just wasn't able to develop close positive relationships (except with a few people here and there). Hiruzen would've made sure his physical needs were taken care of, but he can't force anyone to have a positive emotional relationship with Naruto (and he probably would've recieved a lot of public backlash, perhaps enough to endanger Naruto's life, if he were to have a close familial relationship with him). But that's just my take on it, someone who hasn't been up to date with the fandom for many years.",

There's no reason to think he was malnourished based on his height. He's shorter than his peers, but he isn't actually *short*. 4'9 is a normal height for a 12 year-old boy. A 12 year-old boy who is an average height for his age growing 5 inches in 3 1/2 years is completely normal. He's not even a late bloomer.",

He\u2019s mischievous and feels like he can get away with it bc he knows him. Hiruzen never refers to him as a random kid it\u2019s always by first name. In contrast, all the other kids like Sakura etc have a very different relationship with hiruzen bc they\u2019re not on such a personal level with him like Naruto. To them he\u2019s the hokage, to Naruto he\u2019s the old dude that takes care of him. Naruto even calls him grandpa or something like that. At least from what I saw, Naruto knew him as his caretaker but still wished he had a real family.",

Naruto knows how to read and how both money and the world around him works so clearly someone taught those to him too. The fact that he remembers no one doesn't add up. Espcially when he was younger, because those memories would have been more recent for him.\n\nGaara still remembers his uncle and everything with his uncle clearly. Sasuke still remembers itachi and the good times they had before he killed the clan. The show strongly pushes the narrative that Naruto never had any of that.",

At least as an infant he would have been in some sort of care/group home with other orphans, so he would've been being taken care of, but whether out of spite or just because there wasn't enough resources to devote to each child, he was probably emotionally neglected. The adults probably shunned him as much as they could get away with, and the other kids would've picked up on this and shunned him as well. Emotional neglect can lead to a host of behavioral issues, which would've exasperated Natuto's social situation further, so it's not a stretch to say he was probably given his own private living quarters as soon as he could start acting more independently, and just having a rotation of guards to make sure he's safe and has all of his necessities. So he had enough interaction as a baby/toddler/child to recieve the learning he needed, he just wasn't able to develop close positive relationships (except with a few people here and there). Hiruzen would've made sure his physical needs were taken care of, but he can't force anyone to have a positive emotional relationship with Naruto (and he probably would've recieved a lot of public backlash, perhaps enough to endanger Naruto's life, if he were to have a close familial relationship with him). But that's just my take on it, someone who hasn't been up to date with the fandom for many years.",

Naruto knows how to read and how both money and the world around him works so clearly someone taught those to him too. The fact that he remembers no one doesn't add up. Espcially when he was younger, because those memories would have been more recent for him.\n\nGaara still remembers his uncle and everything with his uncle clearly. Sasuke still remembers itachi and the good times they had before he killed the clan. The show strongly pushes the narrative that Naruto never had any of that.",

At least as an infant he would have been in some sort of care/group home with other orphans, so he would've been being taken care of, but whether out of spite or just because there wasn't enough resources to devote to each child, he was probably emotionally neglected. The adults probably shunned him as much as they could get away with, and the other kids would've picked up on this and shunned him as well. Emotional neglect can lead to a host of behavioral issues, which would've exasperated Natuto's social situation further, so it's not a stretch to say he was probably given his own private living quarters as soon as he could start acting more independently, and just having a rotation of guards to make sure he's safe and has all of his necessities. So he had enough interaction as a baby/toddler/child to recieve the learning he needed, he just wasn't able to develop close positive relationships (except with a few people here and there). Hiruzen would've made sure his physical needs were taken care of, but he can't force anyone to have a positive emotional relationship with Naruto (and he probably would've recieved a lot of public backlash, perhaps enough to endanger Naruto's life, if he were to have a close familial relationship with him). But that's just my take on it, someone who hasn't been up to date with the fandom for many years.",

Naruto knows how to read and how both money and the world around him works so clearly someone taught those to him too. The fact that he remembers no one doesn't add up. Espcially when he was younger, because those memories would have been more recent for him.\n\nGaara still remembers his uncle and everything with his uncle clearly. Sasuke still remembers itachi and the good times they had before he killed the clan. The show strongly pushes the narrative that Naruto never had any of that.",

At least as an infant he would have been in some sort of care/group home with other orphans, so he would've been being taken care of, but whether out of spite or just because there wasn't enough resources to devote to each child, he was probably emotionally neglected. The adults probably shunned him as much as they could get away with, and the other kids would've picked up on this and shunned him as well. Emotional neglect can lead to a host of behavioral issues, which would've exasperated Natuto's social situation further, so it's not a stretch to say he was probably given his own private living quarters as soon as he could start acting more independently, and just having a rotation of guards to make sure he's safe and has all of his necessities. So he had enough interaction as a baby/toddler/child to recieve the learning he needed, he just wasn't able to develop close positive relationships (except with a few people here and there). Hiruzen would've made sure his physical needs were taken care of, but he can't force anyone to have a positive emotional relationship with Naruto (and he probably would've recieved a lot of public backlash, perhaps enough to endanger Naruto's life, if he were to have a close familial relationship with him). But that's just my take on it, someone who hasn't been up to date with the fandom for many years.",

Naruto knows how to read and how both money and the world around him works so clearly someone taught those to him too. The fact that he remembers no one doesn't add up. Espcially when he was younger, because those memories would have been more recent for him.\n\nGaara still remembers his uncle and everything with his uncle clearly. Sasuke still remembers itachi and the good times they had before he killed the clan. The show strongly pushes the narrative that Naruto never had any of that.",

At least as an infant he would have been in some sort of care/group home with other orphans, so he would've been being taken care of, but whether out of spite or just because there wasn't enough resources to devote to each child, he was probably emotionally neglected. The adults probably shunned him as much as they could get away with, and the other kids would've picked up on this and shunned him as well. Emotional neglect can lead to a host of behavioral issues, which would've exasperated Natuto's social situation further, so it's not a stretch to say he was probably given his own private living quarters as soon as he could start acting more independently, and just having a rotation of guards to make sure he's safe and has all of his necessities. So he had enough interaction as a baby/toddler/child to recieve the learning he needed, he just wasn't able to develop close positive relationships (except with a few people here and there). Hiruzen would've made sure his physical needs were taken care of, but he can't force anyone to have a positive emotional relationship with Naruto (and he probably would've recieved a lot of public backlash, perhaps enough to endanger Naruto's life, if he were to have a close familial relationship with him). But that's just my take on it, someone who hasn't been up to date with the fandom for many years.",

Naruto knows how to read and how both money and the world around him works so clearly someone taught those to him too. The fact that he remembers no one doesn't add up. Espcially when he was younger, because those memories would have been more recent for him.\n\nGaara still remembers his uncle and everything with his uncle clearly. Sasuke still remembers itachi and the good times they had before he killed the clan. The show strongly pushes the narrative that Naruto never had any of that.",

At least as an infant he would have been in some sort of care/group home with other orphans, so he would've been being taken care of, but whether out of spite or just because there wasn't enough resources to devote to each child, he was probably emotionally neglected. The adults probably shunned him as much as they could get away with, and the other kids would've picked up on this and shunned him as well. Emotional neglect can lead to a host of behavioral issues, which would've exasperated Natuto's social situation further, so it's not a stretch to say he was probably given his own private living quarters as soon as he could start acting more independently, and just having a rotation of guards to make sure he's safe and has all of his necessities. So he had enough interaction as a baby/toddler/child to recieve the learning he needed, he just wasn't able to develop close positive relationships (except with a few people here and there). Hiruzen would've made sure his physical needs were taken care of, but he can't force anyone to have a positive emotional relationship with Naruto (and he probably would've recieved a lot of public backlash, perhaps enough to endanger Naruto's life, if he were to have a close familial relationship with him). But that's just my take on it, someone who hasn't been up to date with the fandom for many years.",

But in the case of someone with _no_ memories of kindness or recognition they would certainly remember _something_ that happened before.\n\nI still remember some of the teachers who taught me to read when I was a kid. Naruto knows how to read and how both money and the world around him works so clearly someone taught those to him too. The fact that he remembers no one doesn't add up. Espcially when he was younger, because those memories would have been more recent for him.\n\nGaara still remembers his uncle and everything with his uncle clearly. Sasuke still remembers itachi and the good times they had before he killed the clan. The show strongly pushes the narrative that Naruto never had any of that.",
