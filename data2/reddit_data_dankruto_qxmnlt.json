This argument just makes it really sad that Kishimoto stopped using Genjutsu all that much since it's either a win or lose 99% of the time moment thing, but still",

It\u2019s not about overpowering and in fact if you look at the fighting style of Genjutsu masters that\u2019s pretty clear. They don\u2019t tend to have massive chakra pools, they don\u2019t throw out massive overpowering techniques. They take a careful measured approach to combat, which involves deceit, misdirection and very careful use of resources. In fact the most basic Genjutsu we see in the show is the basic clone technique. And the reason Naruto fails at performing that technique is because he can\u2019t control his chakra well enough to not use far too much chakra for the technique. This implies that Genjutsu require very little chakra and that simply throwing more chakra at the technique tends to make it worse not better.",

I'm not saying she magically resists IT passively there despite it having ended like 30-40 chapters before or something. I'm saying she has a feat on par with it, which is resisting a genjutsu from an eye power of a similar evolution level.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo make it clear: I am NOT saying she has already resisted the IT. I'm saying if it were cast again, Post Kaguya fight Sakura has shown feats meaning she would, especially if at full power, likely have the ability to resist or break herself free from the genjutsu.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSakura's first words in 697 say the same thing. You seem to have misread my argument. I'm not saying she was put under the Infinite Tsukoyomi and broke herself out. Let me show you what I am saying in the form of a simple line of reasoning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Rinnesharingan (the one Sasuke has) is a single step evolution past the Rinnegan. The Sharinnegan (the one Madara and Kaguya had) is a single step evolution past the Rinnegan. We see from the power boost given by the Rinnesharingan that it is likely on par with the 3rd eye, or the Sharinnegan. Thus, my argument is that Rinnesharingan is relative in power to the Sharinnegan. And from that, the power of the jutsu they output would also be similar. Therefore, if Sakura can resist and break herself free from a Rinnesharingan genjtutsu she should be able to similarly do so with a Sharinnegan genjutsu.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - Sharinnegan (the Madara and Kaguya one) \\~ Rinnesharingan (Sasuke's one) \\~ Fatigued Sakura < Full power Sakura.",

Sakura **literally** \"broke\" out of it after 10-12hrs. Meaning she didn't \"break\" out of it, it just wore off. There is zero indication that she dispelled or \"broke\" it herself. If we're making baseless assumptions, then it's much more likely that it dispelled due to the fact that Sasuke had nearly run out of chakra to the point where his sharingan was deactivated. She woke up post Indra's Arrow Ultra Rasenshuriken clash, in the middle of the brawl portion of the fight.  \n\n\nTwo, Sasuke had only casually cast an unnamed genjutsu for the sake of preventing her interference in the fight, where as the IT is intended to be in effect for *years*, until the victims are dead, and it requires reflecting the casters eye off the goddamn moon. They are not comparable in the slightest. Just because they were cast with similar level dojutsu doesn't mean the genjutsu themselves are similar in potency or scale automatically. By that logic, Sasuke's Genjutsu: Sharingan that he used on Bee, Itachi's Tsukuyomi that he used on Kakashi, and Shisui's Kotoamatsukami that allowed Itachi to bypass the Reanimation compulsion are all comparable. Enough to make the leap in logic that Killer Bee with Gyuki could resist Kotoamatsukami. Since they are all cast with MS, the exact same stage of Sharingan derived dojutsu.",

As time goes on everyone levels up to his level, but they keep grinding for the better gear. At first he is the strongest character of all, but as time goes on everyone catches up while he stays the same after his peak.",

This argument just makes it really sad that Kishimoto stopped using Genjutsu all that much since it's either a win or lose 99% of the time moment thing, but still",

It\u2019s not about overpowering and in fact if you look at the fighting style of Genjutsu masters that\u2019s pretty clear. They don\u2019t tend to have massive chakra pools, they don\u2019t throw out massive overpowering techniques. They take a careful measured approach to combat, which involves deceit, misdirection and very careful use of resources. In fact the most basic Genjutsu we see in the show is the basic clone technique. And the reason Naruto fails at performing that technique is because he can\u2019t control his chakra well enough to not use far too much chakra for the technique. This implies that Genjutsu require very little chakra and that simply throwing more chakra at the technique tends to make it worse not better.",

Run of the mill genjutsu can be dealt with normally if you notice or are prepared assumedly, but top tier genjutsu is essentially hax.\n\n>Sakura can do it to such an extent by the end of Shippudden she realized she was in a Rinnegan tier genjutsu and snapped herself out of it.\n\nWhen was this?",

I'm not saying she magically resists IT passively there despite it having ended like 30-40 chapters before or something. I'm saying she has a feat on par with it, which is resisting a genjutsu from an eye power of a similar evolution level.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo make it clear: I am NOT saying she has already resisted the IT. I'm saying if it were cast again, Post Kaguya fight Sakura has shown feats meaning she would, especially if at full power, likely have the ability to resist or break herself free from the genjutsu.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSakura's first words in 697 say the same thing. You seem to have misread my argument. I'm not saying she was put under the Infinite Tsukoyomi and broke herself out. Let me show you what I am saying in the form of a simple line of reasoning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Rinnesharingan (the one Sasuke has) is a single step evolution past the Rinnegan. The Sharinnegan (the one Madara and Kaguya had) is a single step evolution past the Rinnegan. We see from the power boost given by the Rinnesharingan that it is likely on par with the 3rd eye, or the Sharinnegan. Thus, my argument is that Rinnesharingan is relative in power to the Sharinnegan. And from that, the power of the jutsu they output would also be similar. Therefore, if Sakura can resist and break herself free from a Rinnesharingan genjtutsu she should be able to similarly do so with a Sharinnegan genjutsu.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - Sharinnegan (the Madara and Kaguya one) \\~ Rinnesharingan (Sasuke's one) \\~ Fatigued Sakura < Full power Sakura.",

Meaning she didn't \"break\" out of it, it just wore off. There is zero indication that she dispelled or \"broke\" it herself. If we're making baseless assumptions, then it's much more likely that it dispelled due to the fact that Sasuke had nearly run out of chakra to the point where his sharingan was deactivated. She woke up post Indra's Arrow Ultra Rasenshuriken clash, in the middle of the brawl portion of the fight.  \n\n\nTwo, Sasuke had only casually cast an unnamed genjutsu for the sake of preventing her interference in the fight, where as the IT is intended to be in effect for *years*, until the victims are dead, and it requires reflecting the casters eye off the goddamn moon. They are not comparable in the slightest. Just because they were cast with similar level dojutsu doesn't mean the genjutsu themselves are similar in potency or scale automatically. By that logic, Sasuke's Genjutsu: Sharingan that he used on Bee, Itachi's Tsukuyomi that he used on Kakashi, and Shisui's Kotoamatsukami that allowed Itachi to bypass the Reanimation compulsion are all comparable. Enough to make the leap in logic that Killer Bee with Gyuki could resist Kotoamatsukami. Since they are all cast with MS, the exact same stage of Sharingan derived dojutsu.",

I think it's more that she just has a natural aptitude towards genjutsu (it was heavily implied to be that way in Part 1) and thus was able to identify it naturally. This argument just makes it really sad that Kishimoto stopped using Genjutsu all that much since it's either a win or lose 99% of the time moment thing, but still",

It\u2019s not about overpowering and in fact if you look at the fighting style of Genjutsu masters that\u2019s pretty clear. They don\u2019t tend to have massive chakra pools, they don\u2019t throw out massive overpowering techniques. They take a careful measured approach to combat, which involves deceit, misdirection and very careful use of resources. In fact the most basic Genjutsu we see in the show is the basic clone technique. And the reason Naruto fails at performing that technique is because he can\u2019t control his chakra well enough to not use far too much chakra for the technique. This implies that Genjutsu require very little chakra and that simply throwing more chakra at the technique tends to make it worse not better.",

Like Sasuke to Kaguya and Kakashi to Orochimaru. So if the difference in chakra was so great that Sakura could immediately sense it like that, odds are it would just overwhelm her outright even if she breaks the genjutsu.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEssentially, if a Genin's chakra levels are so low they can feel the disturbance in chakra, a Jonin should by all means just crush them with a higher level genjutsu like the one that was intended to prevent other Jonin to be able to fight.",

Even high level sensory ninja, like C, one of the Raikage's bodyguards, got put under genjutsu by Summit MS Sasuke with ease. Run of the mill genjutsu can be dealt with normally if you notice or are prepared assumedly, but top tier genjutsu is essentially hax.\n\n>Sakura can do it to such an extent by the end of Shippudden she realized she was in a Rinnegan tier genjutsu and snapped herself out of it.\n\nWhen was this?",

I'm not saying she magically resists IT passively there despite it having ended like 30-40 chapters before or something. I'm saying she has a feat on par with it, which is resisting a genjutsu from an eye power of a similar evolution level.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo make it clear: I am NOT saying she has already resisted the IT. I'm saying if it were cast again, Post Kaguya fight Sakura has shown feats meaning she would, especially if at full power, likely have the ability to resist or break herself free from the genjutsu.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSakura's first words in 697 say the same thing. You seem to have misread my argument. I'm not saying she was put under the Infinite Tsukoyomi and broke herself out. Let me show you what I am saying in the form of a simple line of reasoning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Rinnesharingan (the one Sasuke has) is a single step evolution past the Rinnegan. The Sharinnegan (the one Madara and Kaguya had) is a single step evolution past the Rinnegan. We see from the power boost given by the Rinnesharingan that it is likely on par with the 3rd eye, or the Sharinnegan. Thus, my argument is that Rinnesharingan is relative in power to the Sharinnegan. And from that, the power of the jutsu they output would also be similar. Therefore, if Sakura can resist and break herself free from a Rinnesharingan genjtutsu she should be able to similarly do so with a Sharinnegan genjutsu.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - Sharinnegan (the Madara and Kaguya one) \\~ Rinnesharingan (Sasuke's one) \\~ Fatigued Sakura < Full power Sakura.",

Meaning she didn't \"break\" out of it, it just wore off. There is zero indication that she dispelled or \"broke\" it herself. If we're making baseless assumptions, then it's much more likely that it dispelled due to the fact that Sasuke had nearly run out of chakra to the point where his sharingan was deactivated. She woke up post Indra's Arrow Ultra Rasenshuriken clash, in the middle of the brawl portion of the fight.  \n\n\nTwo, Sasuke had only casually cast an unnamed genjutsu for the sake of preventing her interference in the fight, where as the IT is intended to be in effect for *years*, until the victims are dead, and it requires reflecting the casters eye off the goddamn moon. They are not comparable in the slightest. Just because they were cast with similar level dojutsu doesn't mean the genjutsu themselves are similar in potency or scale automatically. By that logic, Sasuke's Genjutsu: Sharingan that he used on Bee, Itachi's Tsukuyomi that he used on Kakashi, and Shisui's Kotoamatsukami that allowed Itachi to bypass the Reanimation compulsion are all comparable. Enough to make the leap in logic that Killer Bee with Gyuki could resist Kotoamatsukami. Since they are all cast with MS, the exact same stage of Sharingan derived dojutsu.",

As time goes on everyone levels up to his level, but they keep grinding for the better gear.

It\u2019s not about overpowering and in fact if you look at the fighting style of Genjutsu masters that\u2019s pretty clear. They don\u2019t tend to have massive chakra pools, they don\u2019t throw out massive overpowering techniques. They take a careful measured approach to combat, which involves deceit, misdirection and very careful use of resources. In fact the most basic Genjutsu we see in the show is the basic clone technique. And the reason Naruto fails at performing that technique is because he can\u2019t control his chakra well enough to not use far too much chakra for the technique. This implies that Genjutsu require very little chakra and that simply throwing more chakra at the technique tends to make it worse not better.",

Like Sasuke to Kaguya and Kakashi to Orochimaru. So if the difference in chakra was so great that Sakura could immediately sense it like that, odds are it would just overwhelm her outright even if she breaks the genjutsu.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEssentially, if a Genin's chakra levels are so low they can feel the disturbance in chakra, a Jonin should by all means just crush them with a higher level genjutsu like the one that was intended to prevent other Jonin to be able to fight.",

I want you to take a minute and re-read this specific paragraph. My point is NOT that Naruto with all his powers is under Kage level.

Run of the mill genjutsu can be dealt with normally if you notice or are prepared assumedly, but top tier genjutsu is essentially hax.\n\n>Sakura can do it to such an extent by the end of Shippudden she realized she was in a Rinnegan tier genjutsu and snapped herself out of it.\n\nWhen was this?",

C is a perfect example. He watched himself get genjutsu\u2019d but could do nothing about it.

I'm not saying she magically resists IT passively there despite it having ended like 30-40 chapters before or something. I'm saying she has a feat on par with it, which is resisting a genjutsu from an eye power of a similar evolution level.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo make it clear: I am NOT saying she has already resisted the IT. I'm saying if it were cast again, Post Kaguya fight Sakura has shown feats meaning she would, especially if at full power, likely have the ability to resist or break herself free from the genjutsu.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSakura's first words in 697 say the same thing. You seem to have misread my argument. I'm not saying she was put under the Infinite Tsukoyomi and broke herself out. Let me show you what I am saying in the form of a simple line of reasoning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Rinnesharingan (the one Sasuke has) is a single step evolution past the Rinnegan. The Sharinnegan (the one Madara and Kaguya had) is a single step evolution past the Rinnegan. We see from the power boost given by the Rinnesharingan that it is likely on par with the 3rd eye, or the Sharinnegan. Thus, my argument is that Rinnesharingan is relative in power to the Sharinnegan. And from that, the power of the jutsu they output would also be similar. Therefore, if Sakura can resist and break herself free from a Rinnesharingan genjtutsu she should be able to similarly do so with a Sharinnegan genjutsu.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - Sharinnegan (the Madara and Kaguya one) \\~ Rinnesharingan (Sasuke's one) \\~ Fatigued Sakura < Full power Sakura.",

Meaning she didn't \"break\" out of it, it just wore off. There is zero indication that she dispelled or \"broke\" it herself. If we're making baseless assumptions, then it's much more likely that it dispelled due to the fact that Sasuke had nearly run out of chakra to the point where his sharingan was deactivated. She woke up post Indra's Arrow Ultra Rasenshuriken clash, in the middle of the brawl portion of the fight.  \n\n\nTwo, Sasuke had only casually cast an unnamed genjutsu for the sake of preventing her interference in the fight, where as the IT is intended to be in effect for *years*, until the victims are dead, and it requires reflecting the casters eye off the goddamn moon. They are not comparable in the slightest. Just because they were cast with similar level dojutsu doesn't mean the genjutsu themselves are similar in potency or scale automatically. By that logic, Sasuke's Genjutsu: Sharingan that he used on Bee, Itachi's Tsukuyomi that he used on Kakashi, and Shisui's Kotoamatsukami that allowed Itachi to bypass the Reanimation compulsion are all comparable. Enough to make the leap in logic that Killer Bee with Gyuki could resist Kotoamatsukami. Since they are all cast with MS, the exact same stage of Sharingan derived dojutsu.",

It\u2019s not about overpowering and in fact if you look at the fighting style of Genjutsu masters that\u2019s pretty clear. They don\u2019t tend to have massive chakra pools, they don\u2019t throw out massive overpowering techniques. They take a careful measured approach to combat, which involves deceit, misdirection and very careful use of resources. In fact the most basic Genjutsu we see in the show is the basic clone technique. And the reason Naruto fails at performing that technique is because he can\u2019t control his chakra well enough to not use far too much chakra for the technique. This implies that Genjutsu require very little chakra and that simply throwing more chakra at the technique tends to make it worse not better.",

I want you to take a minute and re-read this specific paragraph. My point is NOT that Naruto with all his powers is under Kage level.

I'm not saying she magically resists IT passively there despite it having ended like 30-40 chapters before or something. I'm saying she has a feat on par with it, which is resisting a genjutsu from an eye power of a similar evolution level.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo make it clear: I am NOT saying she has already resisted the IT. I'm saying if it were cast again, Post Kaguya fight Sakura has shown feats meaning she would, especially if at full power, likely have the ability to resist or break herself free from the genjutsu.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSakura's first words in 697 say the same thing. You seem to have misread my argument. I'm not saying she was put under the Infinite Tsukoyomi and broke herself out. Let me show you what I am saying in the form of a simple line of reasoning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Rinnesharingan (the one Sasuke has) is a single step evolution past the Rinnegan. The Sharinnegan (the one Madara and Kaguya had) is a single step evolution past the Rinnegan. We see from the power boost given by the Rinnesharingan that it is likely on par with the 3rd eye, or the Sharinnegan. Thus, my argument is that Rinnesharingan is relative in power to the Sharinnegan. And from that, the power of the jutsu they output would also be similar. Therefore, if Sakura can resist and break herself free from a Rinnesharingan genjtutsu she should be able to similarly do so with a Sharinnegan genjutsu.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - Sharinnegan (the Madara and Kaguya one) \\~ Rinnesharingan (Sasuke's one) \\~ Fatigued Sakura < Full power Sakura.",

Meaning she didn't \"break\" out of it, it just wore off. There is zero indication that she dispelled or \"broke\" it herself. If we're making baseless assumptions, then it's much more likely that it dispelled due to the fact that Sasuke had nearly run out of chakra to the point where his sharingan was deactivated. She woke up post Indra's Arrow Ultra Rasenshuriken clash, in the middle of the brawl portion of the fight.  \n\n\nTwo, Sasuke had only casually cast an unnamed genjutsu for the sake of preventing her interference in the fight, where as the IT is intended to be in effect for *years*, until the victims are dead, and it requires reflecting the casters eye off the goddamn moon. They are not comparable in the slightest. Just because they were cast with similar level dojutsu doesn't mean the genjutsu themselves are similar in potency or scale automatically. By that logic, Sasuke's Genjutsu: Sharingan that he used on Bee, Itachi's Tsukuyomi that he used on Kakashi, and Shisui's Kotoamatsukami that allowed Itachi to bypass the Reanimation compulsion are all comparable. Enough to make the leap in logic that Killer Bee with Gyuki could resist Kotoamatsukami. Since they are all cast with MS, the exact same stage of Sharingan derived dojutsu.",

It\u2019s not about overpowering and in fact if you look at the fighting style of Genjutsu masters that\u2019s pretty clear. They don\u2019t tend to have massive chakra pools, they don\u2019t throw out massive overpowering techniques. They take a careful measured approach to combat, which involves deceit, misdirection and very careful use of resources. In fact the most basic Genjutsu we see in the show is the basic clone technique. And the reason Naruto fails at performing that technique is because he can\u2019t control his chakra well enough to not use far too much chakra for the technique. This implies that Genjutsu require very little chakra and that simply throwing more chakra at the technique tends to make it worse not better.",

Sakura didn't bcz she knew it aint the real Sasuke thats why she thought it was a dream or genjutsu.",

Because as I recall that\u2019s pretty much the only thing even implied to get a Jinchuriki that\u2019s genjutsu related.\n\nBut we also know if you\u2019re not strong enough to break out on your own you can\u2019t. C is a perfect example. He watched himself get genjutsu\u2019d but could do nothing about it. So it still implies Sakura is on a level that she can identify and escape these genjutsu better than anyone, be that because she\u2019s got the right mental state to realize they\u2019re a genjutsu or not it\u2019s still a fact.",

I'm not saying she magically resists IT passively there despite it having ended like 30-40 chapters before or something. I'm saying she has a feat on par with it, which is resisting a genjutsu from an eye power of a similar evolution level.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo make it clear: I am NOT saying she has already resisted the IT. I'm saying if it were cast again, Post Kaguya fight Sakura has shown feats meaning she would, especially if at full power, likely have the ability to resist or break herself free from the genjutsu.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSakura's first words in 697 say the same thing. You seem to have misread my argument. I'm not saying she was put under the Infinite Tsukoyomi and broke herself out. Let me show you what I am saying in the form of a simple line of reasoning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Rinnesharingan (the one Sasuke has) is a single step evolution past the Rinnegan. The Sharinnegan (the one Madara and Kaguya had) is a single step evolution past the Rinnegan. We see from the power boost given by the Rinnesharingan that it is likely on par with the 3rd eye, or the Sharinnegan. Thus, my argument is that Rinnesharingan is relative in power to the Sharinnegan. And from that, the power of the jutsu they output would also be similar. Therefore, if Sakura can resist and break herself free from a Rinnesharingan genjtutsu she should be able to similarly do so with a Sharinnegan genjutsu.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - Sharinnegan (the Madara and Kaguya one) \\~ Rinnesharingan (Sasuke's one) \\~ Fatigued Sakura < Full power Sakura.",

Meaning she didn't \"break\" out of it, it just wore off. There is zero indication that she dispelled or \"broke\" it herself. If we're making baseless assumptions, then it's much more likely that it dispelled due to the fact that Sasuke had nearly run out of chakra to the point where his sharingan was deactivated. She woke up post Indra's Arrow Ultra Rasenshuriken clash, in the middle of the brawl portion of the fight.  \n\n\nTwo, Sasuke had only casually cast an unnamed genjutsu for the sake of preventing her interference in the fight, where as the IT is intended to be in effect for *years*, until the victims are dead, and it requires reflecting the casters eye off the goddamn moon. They are not comparable in the slightest. Just because they were cast with similar level dojutsu doesn't mean the genjutsu themselves are similar in potency or scale automatically. By that logic, Sasuke's Genjutsu: Sharingan that he used on Bee, Itachi's Tsukuyomi that he used on Kakashi, and Shisui's Kotoamatsukami that allowed Itachi to bypass the Reanimation compulsion are all comparable. Enough to make the leap in logic that Killer Bee with Gyuki could resist Kotoamatsukami. Since they are all cast with MS, the exact same stage of Sharingan derived dojutsu.",

It\u2019s not about overpowering and in fact if you look at the fighting style of Genjutsu masters that\u2019s pretty clear. They don\u2019t tend to have massive chakra pools, they don\u2019t throw out massive overpowering techniques. They take a careful measured approach to combat, which involves deceit, misdirection and very careful use of resources. In fact the most basic Genjutsu we see in the show is the basic clone technique. And the reason Naruto fails at performing that technique is because he can\u2019t control his chakra well enough to not use far too much chakra for the technique. This implies that Genjutsu require very little chakra and that simply throwing more chakra at the technique tends to make it worse not better.",

Go read the last comment. I debunked this claim before you made it. For fun I'll copy paste it here so you can see it's in both.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"What you are doing is like saying \"Juubi Madara has the skeletal Susanoo and Juubi Madara is Six Paths tier, so Skeletal Susanoo is Six Paths tier\". My argument has nothing to do with where Naruto scales at full power. My argument is that Naruto not using this full power and thus under Kage level is still able to cast a Rasengan.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn this case, full power being Kurama chakra.",

C is a perfect example. He watched himself get genjutsu\u2019d but could do nothing about it.

I'm not saying she magically resists IT passively there despite it having ended like 30-40 chapters before or something. I'm saying she has a feat on par with it, which is resisting a genjutsu from an eye power of a similar evolution level.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo make it clear: I am NOT saying she has already resisted the IT. I'm saying if it were cast again, Post Kaguya fight Sakura has shown feats meaning she would, especially if at full power, likely have the ability to resist or break herself free from the genjutsu.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSakura's first words in 697 say the same thing. You seem to have misread my argument. I'm not saying she was put under the Infinite Tsukoyomi and broke herself out. Let me show you what I am saying in the form of a simple line of reasoning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Rinnesharingan (the one Sasuke has) is a single step evolution past the Rinnegan. The Sharinnegan (the one Madara and Kaguya had) is a single step evolution past the Rinnegan. We see from the power boost given by the Rinnesharingan that it is likely on par with the 3rd eye, or the Sharinnegan. Thus, my argument is that Rinnesharingan is relative in power to the Sharinnegan. And from that, the power of the jutsu they output would also be similar. Therefore, if Sakura can resist and break herself free from a Rinnesharingan genjtutsu she should be able to similarly do so with a Sharinnegan genjutsu.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - Sharinnegan (the Madara and Kaguya one) \\~ Rinnesharingan (Sasuke's one) \\~ Fatigued Sakura < Full power Sakura.",

Meaning she didn't \"break\" out of it, it just wore off. There is zero indication that she dispelled or \"broke\" it herself. If we're making baseless assumptions, then it's much more likely that it dispelled due to the fact that Sasuke had nearly run out of chakra to the point where his sharingan was deactivated. She woke up post Indra's Arrow Ultra Rasenshuriken clash, in the middle of the brawl portion of the fight.  \n\n\nTwo, Sasuke had only casually cast an unnamed genjutsu for the sake of preventing her interference in the fight, where as the IT is intended to be in effect for *years*, until the victims are dead, and it requires reflecting the casters eye off the goddamn moon. They are not comparable in the slightest. Just because they were cast with similar level dojutsu doesn't mean the genjutsu themselves are similar in potency or scale automatically. By that logic, Sasuke's Genjutsu: Sharingan that he used on Bee, Itachi's Tsukuyomi that he used on Kakashi, and Shisui's Kotoamatsukami that allowed Itachi to bypass the Reanimation compulsion are all comparable. Enough to make the leap in logic that Killer Bee with Gyuki could resist Kotoamatsukami. Since they are all cast with MS, the exact same stage of Sharingan derived dojutsu.",

Sakura didn't bcz she knew it aint the real Sasuke thats why she thought it was a dream or genjutsu.",

Because as I recall that\u2019s pretty much the only thing even implied to get a Jinchuriki that\u2019s genjutsu related.\n\nBut we also know if you\u2019re not strong enough to break out on your own you can\u2019t. C is a perfect example. He watched himself get genjutsu\u2019d but could do nothing about it. So it still implies Sakura is on a level that she can identify and escape these genjutsu better than anyone, be that because she\u2019s got the right mental state to realize they\u2019re a genjutsu or not it\u2019s still a fact.",

I'm not saying she magically resists IT passively there despite it having ended like 30-40 chapters before or something. I'm saying she has a feat on par with it, which is resisting a genjutsu from an eye power of a similar evolution level.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo make it clear: I am NOT saying she has already resisted the IT. I'm saying if it were cast again, Post Kaguya fight Sakura has shown feats meaning she would, especially if at full power, likely have the ability to resist or break herself free from the genjutsu.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSakura's first words in 697 say the same thing. You seem to have misread my argument. I'm not saying she was put under the Infinite Tsukoyomi and broke herself out. Let me show you what I am saying in the form of a simple line of reasoning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Rinnesharingan (the one Sasuke has) is a single step evolution past the Rinnegan. The Sharinnegan (the one Madara and Kaguya had) is a single step evolution past the Rinnegan. We see from the power boost given by the Rinnesharingan that it is likely on par with the 3rd eye, or the Sharinnegan. Thus, my argument is that Rinnesharingan is relative in power to the Sharinnegan. And from that, the power of the jutsu they output would also be similar. Therefore, if Sakura can resist and break herself free from a Rinnesharingan genjtutsu she should be able to similarly do so with a Sharinnegan genjutsu.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - Sharinnegan (the Madara and Kaguya one) \\~ Rinnesharingan (Sasuke's one) \\~ Fatigued Sakura < Full power Sakura.",

                            "body": "One, the relevance of the chapters is the time elapsed. Sakura **literally** \"broke\" out of it after 10-12hrs. Meaning she didn't \"break\" out of it, it just wore off. There is zero indication that she dispelled or \"broke\" it herself. If we're making baseless assumptions, then it's much more likely that it dispelled due to the fact that Sasuke had nearly run out of chakra to the point where his sharingan was deactivated. She woke up post Indra's Arrow Ultra Rasenshuriken clash, in the middle of the brawl portion of the fight.  \n\n\nTwo, Sasuke had only casually cast an unnamed genjutsu for the sake of preventing her interference in the fight, where as the IT is intended to be in effect for *years*, until the victims are dead, and it requires reflecting the casters eye off the goddamn moon. They are not comparable in the slightest. Just because they were cast with similar level dojutsu doesn't mean the genjutsu themselves are similar in potency or scale automatically. By that logic, Sasuke's Genjutsu: Sharingan that he used on Bee, Itachi's Tsukuyomi that he used on Kakashi, and Shisui's Kotoamatsukami that allowed Itachi to bypass the Reanimation compulsion are all comparable. Enough to make the leap in logic that Killer Bee with Gyuki could resist Kotoamatsukami. Since they are all cast with MS, the exact same stage of Sharingan derived dojutsu.",

I'm not saying she magically resists IT passively there despite it having ended like 30-40 chapters before or something. I'm saying she has a feat on par with it, which is resisting a genjutsu from an eye power of a similar evolution level.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo make it clear: I am NOT saying she has already resisted the IT. I'm saying if it were cast again, Post Kaguya fight Sakura has shown feats meaning she would, especially if at full power, likely have the ability to resist or break herself free from the genjutsu.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSakura's first words in 697 say the same thing. You seem to have misread my argument. I'm not saying she was put under the Infinite Tsukoyomi and broke herself out. Let me show you what I am saying in the form of a simple line of reasoning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Rinnesharingan (the one Sasuke has) is a single step evolution past the Rinnegan. The Sharinnegan (the one Madara and Kaguya had) is a single step evolution past the Rinnegan. We see from the power boost given by the Rinnesharingan that it is likely on par with the 3rd eye, or the Sharinnegan. Thus, my argument is that Rinnesharingan is relative in power to the Sharinnegan. And from that, the power of the jutsu they output would also be similar. Therefore, if Sakura can resist and break herself free from a Rinnesharingan genjtutsu she should be able to similarly do so with a Sharinnegan genjutsu.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - Sharinnegan (the Madara and Kaguya one) \\~ Rinnesharingan (Sasuke's one) \\~ Fatigued Sakura < Full power Sakura.",

There is zero indication that she dispelled or \"broke\" it herself. If we're making baseless assumptions, then it's much more likely that it dispelled due to the fact that Sasuke had nearly run out of chakra to the point where his sharingan was deactivated. She woke up post Indra's Arrow Ultra Rasenshuriken clash, in the middle of the brawl portion of the fight.  \n\n\nTwo, Sasuke had only casually cast an unnamed genjutsu for the sake of preventing her interference in the fight, where as the IT is intended to be in effect for *years*, until the victims are dead, and it requires reflecting the casters eye off the goddamn moon. They are not comparable in the slightest. Just because they were cast with similar level dojutsu doesn't mean the genjutsu themselves are similar in potency or scale automatically. By that logic, Sasuke's Genjutsu: Sharingan that he used on Bee, Itachi's Tsukuyomi that he used on Kakashi, and Shisui's Kotoamatsukami that allowed Itachi to bypass the Reanimation compulsion are all comparable. Enough to make the leap in logic that Killer Bee with Gyuki could resist Kotoamatsukami. Since they are all cast with MS, the exact same stage of Sharingan derived dojutsu.",

There is zero indication that she dispelled or \"broke\" it herself. If we're making baseless assumptions, then it's much more likely that it dispelled due to the fact that Sasuke had nearly run out of chakra to the point where his sharingan was deactivated. She woke up post Indra's Arrow Ultra Rasenshuriken clash, in the middle of the brawl portion of the fight.  \n\n\nTwo, Sasuke had only casually cast an unnamed genjutsu for the sake of preventing her interference in the fight, where as the IT is intended to be in effect for *years*, until the victims are dead, and it requires reflecting the casters eye off the goddamn moon. They are not comparable in the slightest. Just because they were cast with similar level dojutsu doesn't mean the genjutsu themselves are similar in potency or scale automatically. By that logic, Sasuke's Genjutsu: Sharingan that he used on Bee, Itachi's Tsukuyomi that he used on Kakashi, and Shisui's Kotoamatsukami that allowed Itachi to bypass the Reanimation compulsion are all comparable. Enough to make the leap in logic that Killer Bee with Gyuki could resist Kotoamatsukami. Since they are all cast with MS, the exact same stage of Sharingan derived dojutsu.",

I want you to take a minute and re-read this specific paragraph. My point is NOT that Naruto with all his powers is under Kage level. My point is that when Naruto is not using the powers that make him Kage level (Kyuubi chakra), making him under Kage level, he is still able to use the jutsu in question.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat you are doing is like saying \"Juubi Madara has the skeletal Susanoo and Juubi Madara is Six Paths tier, so Skeletal Susanoo is Six Paths tier\".

I want you to take a minute and re-read this specific paragraph. My point is NOT that Naruto with all his powers is under Kage level. My point is that when Naruto is not using the powers that make him Kage level (Kyuubi chakra), making him under Kage level, he is still able to use the jutsu in question.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat you are doing is like saying \"Juubi Madara has the skeletal Susanoo and Juubi Madara is Six Paths tier, so Skeletal Susanoo is Six Paths tier\".

If you took the Kid Naruto that Rasengan'd Kabuto and put him against Kyuubi Influence Naruto from the Land of Waves he would be slaughtered.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou have once again failed to read my comment. Go read the last comment. I debunked this claim before you made it. For fun I'll copy paste it here so you can see it's in both.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"What you are doing is like saying \"Juubi Madara has the skeletal Susanoo and Juubi Madara is Six Paths tier, so Skeletal Susanoo is Six Paths tier\". My argument has nothing to do with where Naruto scales at full power. My argument is that Naruto not using this full power and thus under Kage level is still able to cast a Rasengan.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn this case, full power being Kurama chakra.",

I want you to take a minute and re-read this specific paragraph. My point is NOT that Naruto with all his powers is under Kage level.
