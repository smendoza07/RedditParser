    "body": "Am I the only woman here who is turned on when a man knows how to be a man? He has class and isn\u2019t jumping down your throat every conversation about different positions he wants to put you in ? Many of us know why we are seeking an SR and the ones who know how to be respectful know how to not jump down a man\u2019s throat for money and scare him off. I mean jeez it sucks so many people have made this world a shithole. I mean why do so many older men act like the younger men we apparently aren\u2019t seeking. It\u2019s exhausting.",

Men stop asking women if they\u2019re submissive and just BE dominant, be endearing, don\u2019t disregard our feelings or simply leave us alone. Stop treating women as someone to get your D wet.

They believe that being a man means taking control, acting tough, not showing your emotions, etc.  They see women as the enemy that needs to be conquered. They preach about how to act like an Alpha and how to be an Alpha. \n\nTrue Alphas don't care about being an Alpha. They don't want to be an Alpha, but are recognized as an Alpha by others.  They don't try to be a leader, but are chosen to lead.  \n\nConfidence is attractive, but arrogance is not. Confidence is knowing you have attributes that others value.  Arrogance is believing you are better than other people because of those attributes. \n\nTrue Men protect, provide, care for and respect others.  They are willing to put other's needs ahead of their own. They don't feel the need to bully, brag, boast or show off.  They value women and want to make them feel safe, secure, wanted, appreciated and respected.  Being a gentlemen is a sign of respect.",

I get inappropriate crushes on characters in black and white movies, golden age mystery novels, 1950s sitcoms.\n\nI also prefer a correlate power dynamic but I\u2019m actually not sure if the bedroom dynamic springs from preferring to be treated a certain way outside of it or the other way round.

            "body": "**the following response was more to the broader role of masculinity in society. My direct OP response is that it sounds more just like men being excited to have someone pretty to sleep with lmao**\n\nBeing on the younger end of SDs. I have found that it genuinely is just taking on responsibility and learning to manage risk and stress and push through anxiety and be uncomfortable that will afford you any of these qualities. And I'm by no means the master of any of them and I always choose to lead from behind. Behind the curtains > star of the show. \n\nBravado and bluster is helpful, but the simplistic views on masculinity that often come with it are a bit reductive. That being said most women absolutely like men taking charge in some form, and I think the subtext that makes all the difference to this is whether the man is doing it to take care of a situation or because he's doing it \"to take charge as the man hrmph\". \n\nWith all that said, and I appreciate how silly this sounds **You gotta give men some slack in this department**\n\nForgetting the fact that the concept of masculinity and want for strong partners comes with the almost mutually exclusive confusing notions that they're somehow \"a leader who takes charge\" while also isnt \"patriarchal and trying to control things\"  I think men grown up within a western culture today are dealing with an identity crisis that's new and not easy to navigate. \n\nWe're getting told from women on both ends opposing wants, under 30s and over 30s see very different in expectations in my experience. Gender identity is in question in society as a whole. The nuclear family is gone but the want for a man who can provide for the family isnt. Disproportionate fears of being accused as a sexual predator is on rise, the risks that this holds is on your life is on the rise. Reductive redpill and MRA and incel culture exists as echo chamber traps, there's less incentive for people to commune and bridge differences with the advent of internet society and social media, hardcore reality distorting porn and instagram models are completely fucking up sexual and physical expectations on both ends. And online dating and hookup society is resulting in more \"alpha\" men getting more options while the less fortunate become less experienced and less confident and basically the amount of relationships are becoming shorter and less frequent now. \n\nNone of this is anyone's \"fault\", women's movement is grand and they should continue pushing for the changes that society needs to adopt. It is on us men to come to terms to these changes and adjust to a growing gender equitable society. \n\nBut as an at best lower middle class white man who just survived his 20s before \"making it\" (with very little help afforded to me for being white or male fyi in regards to my particular means of making it) this shit isn't psychologically or emotionally easy, especially if you're smart enough to need to have your confidence built-into something material and not resulting from a lack of self awareness and boisterous personality affording you more experience with women from a younger age.  \n\nThe majority of us were just not prepared, we're experiencing the biggest gap in expectation vs reality than any other group, we're literally grown up with an idea of  what a successful man is, just to then have that fragile identity shattered. \n\nBefore hand, you got a good grade at school, you got a job that had career development opportunities, a decent mortgage and an affordable house, free education, a salary to pay for a family and a wife because it's basically expected of her and shes old af if she's not a mom by 25 and \"he's got a manager job\" was literally a good enough reason for marriage. \n\nNow, simply matching what your dad had is exponentially more difficult, all while online dating and casual sex and female sexual liberation has led to sexual selectivity and competition to sharply increase. \n\nSugardating in many ways is one of the last few places where this hyper exaggerated masculine feminine dynamic can exist simplistically, because one of them is literally loaded enough to be able to afford to allow the other to play some hyper feminine role, it's not strictly monogamous, and parameters are usually well defined. \n\nIn order for me to get to a place where I can pick my partner's, I literally had to sacrifice my health, forego job opportunities and income, go hermit for 5 years and not date or hang out with people until I  figured out how to run a successful business after a lot of failure.",

But I can't sit here and pretend they've got it good either. \n\nIn Iran women are protesting not being executed for not wearing a bit of religious headwear. In the US the federal right to bodily autonomy was just revoked, a right just recently afforded the Irish in the British isles. But oh dear, men don't know to be men anymore, they cant earn enough to literally support an entire family anymore. Y'see what I'm saying? These issues are not exactly comparable.\n\nI cant imagine any smart woman secure in herself I know possibly objecting to me pointing out these issues either, not unless it had some sort of criticism of feminism baked into it.

And, perhaps, a scarcity of role models navigating the landscape with any degree of strength and grace. It\u2019s hard to aim for a goal you can\u2019t even decide on. And then, terrible women like me who claim to want one thing but actually want something rather different only know we aren\u2019t allowed to.\n\nI also see a more sinister side in it being quite profitable to lean into this uncertainty & stoke it or twist it. I see that in the red pill crowd and the rise of Andrew Tate and a million other things. Resentment can be wildly profitable, as can the sale of a twisted sense of superiority and power where men feel they have none. Grievance and hatred of women can at least be fashioned into a seemingly coherent worldview. Sticking it to them or reigning them in a mission. And I do wonder how much men talking about women is actually men talking about an absence of the latter two things. \n\nOn the other hand, I feel that the crisis of masculinity itself, it\u2019s focus, and it\u2019s hold on social and cultural narratives, is itself to do with manhood being a privileged position in a way womanhood never will be. I\u2019ve never heard, for instance, that I throw like a *boy* or I\u2019m behaving like *a little boy* or hit like a *boy* or need to *be a woman.* There never was a coherent ideal to aspire to which would command respect. I\u2019m either a bitch or an incompetent pushover, a slut or a prude, etc. I always knew I couldn\u2019t win. I think men are losing their minds because for the first time, they may not either.

Yeah sorry, not gonna be my thing.\n\nAlso I don't get why you're so defensive about me wanting men to give me expensive experiences. Does it affect you at a personal level or anything?",

At home they been abused by their spouse so they are looking for an escape.  A lot of women today make same or more money then their husbands so they don't feel they need to provide their husbands regular sex.  A lot of women are also becoming unattractive and overweight once they hit their late 30s and older.  So it's naturally many men are seeking young SBs for their fix.",

And, perhaps, a scarcity of role models navigating the landscape with any degree of strength and grace. It\u2019s hard to aim for a goal you can\u2019t even decide on. And then, terrible women like me who claim to want one thing but actually want something rather different only know we aren\u2019t allowed to.\n\nI also see a more sinister side in it being quite profitable to lean into this uncertainty & stoke it or twist it. I see that in the red pill crowd and the rise of Andrew Tate and a million other things. Resentment can be wildly profitable, as can the sale of a twisted sense of superiority and power where men feel they have none. Grievance and hatred of women can at least be fashioned into a seemingly coherent worldview. Sticking it to them or reigning them in a mission. And I do wonder how much men talking about women is actually men talking about an absence of the latter two things. \n\nOn the other hand, I feel that the crisis of masculinity itself, it\u2019s focus, and it\u2019s hold on social and cultural narratives, is itself to do with manhood being a privileged position in a way womanhood never will be. I\u2019ve never heard, for instance, that I throw like a *boy* or I\u2019m behaving like *a little boy* or hit like a *boy* or need to *be a woman.* There never was a coherent ideal to aspire to which would command respect. I\u2019m either a bitch or an incompetent pushover, a slut or a prude, etc. I always knew I couldn\u2019t win. I think men are losing their minds because for the first time, they may not either.

When these communities look for solutions to deal with these grievances in a positive way, it can be very healthy.  Unfortunately, most of these communities have become echo chambers that only focus on being victims and not on solutions. Many of these communities have become unwitting pawns of sinister people that want to further divide and weaken society to their benefit.",

And, perhaps, a scarcity of role models navigating the landscape with any degree of strength and grace. It\u2019s hard to aim for a goal you can\u2019t even decide on. And then, terrible women like me who claim to want one thing but actually want something rather different only know we aren\u2019t allowed to.\n\nI also see a more sinister side in it being quite profitable to lean into this uncertainty & stoke it or twist it. I see that in the red pill crowd and the rise of Andrew Tate and a million other things. Resentment can be wildly profitable, as can the sale of a twisted sense of superiority and power where men feel they have none. Grievance and hatred of women can at least be fashioned into a seemingly coherent worldview. Sticking it to them or reigning them in a mission. And I do wonder how much men talking about women is actually men talking about an absence of the latter two things. \n\nOn the other hand, I feel that the crisis of masculinity itself, it\u2019s focus, and it\u2019s hold on social and cultural narratives, is itself to do with manhood being a privileged position in a way womanhood never will be. I\u2019ve never heard, for instance, that I throw like a *boy* or I\u2019m behaving like *a little boy* or hit like a *boy* or need to *be a woman.* There never was a coherent ideal to aspire to which would command respect. I\u2019m either a bitch or an incompetent pushover, a slut or a prude, etc. I always knew I couldn\u2019t win. I think men are losing their minds because for the first time, they may not either.

And, perhaps, a scarcity of role models navigating the landscape with any degree of strength and grace. It\u2019s hard to aim for a goal you can\u2019t even decide on. And then, terrible women like me who claim to want one thing but actually want something rather different only know we aren\u2019t allowed to.\n\nI also see a more sinister side in it being quite profitable to lean into this uncertainty & stoke it or twist it. I see that in the red pill crowd and the rise of Andrew Tate and a million other things. Resentment can be wildly profitable, as can the sale of a twisted sense of superiority and power where men feel they have none. Grievance and hatred of women can at least be fashioned into a seemingly coherent worldview. Sticking it to them or reigning them in a mission. And I do wonder how much men talking about women is actually men talking about an absence of the latter two things. \n\nOn the other hand, I feel that the crisis of masculinity itself, it\u2019s focus, and it\u2019s hold on social and cultural narratives, is itself to do with manhood being a privileged position in a way womanhood never will be. I\u2019ve never heard, for instance, that I throw like a *boy* or I\u2019m behaving like *a little boy* or hit like a *boy* or need to *be a woman.* There never was a coherent ideal to aspire to which would command respect. I\u2019m either a bitch or an incompetent pushover, a slut or a prude, etc. I always knew I couldn\u2019t win. I think men are losing their minds because for the first time, they may not either.
