You\u2019ll want it down near the hairline of the back of your neck and have your hair flowing downwards through it. Put the hair tie perpendicular to your skull a little. Any time you snug a hair tie this tight to your skull the hair will stick out like this.\n\nGoogle long hair ponytails and you\u2019ll notice the difference in hair tie position",
