    "body": "Hi loves!\n\nUnfortunately i'm in lockdown here in Europe.\nMy SD knows i am not able to go to work. On top of the money that he gives me as an allowance, he's giving me a lot more extra because i have to stay at home right now. I did not even ask for it but he offered. I'm so thankful to have him in my life. He's kind, sweet, charming, funny and helpful in so many ways.\nToday i received a huge package with 2 months worth of groceries. He didn't tell me he ordered this for me upfront, so i was very suprised. \nApart from food he also sent me 3 bottles of quality French wine and a bottle of Dom P\u00e9rignon. Again, i didn't ask for anything of this, but he keeps suprising me in many ways.\u2764\ufe0f",
