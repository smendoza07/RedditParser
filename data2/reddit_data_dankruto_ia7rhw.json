Of course, realistically speaking, Itachi would never try to fight him head on unless he absolutely had to, he'd nope the fuck out the first chance he got.",

Of course, realistically speaking, Itachi would never try to fight him head on unless he absolutely had to, he'd nope the fuck out the first chance he got.",

Of course, realistically speaking, Itachi would never try to fight him head on unless he absolutely had to, he'd nope the fuck out the first chance he got.",

Of course, realistically speaking, Itachi would never try to fight him head on unless he absolutely had to, he'd nope the fuck out the first chance he got.",

Of course, realistically speaking, Itachi would never try to fight him head on unless he absolutely had to, he'd nope the fuck out the first chance he got.",
