    "body": "A first date story..\n\nSo I met this guy on SA, he was fairly young for an SD at 32 and had \"Instagram worthy\" photos on his account that wasn't verified at the time, so I thought two things, either he's scammer or he's a catfish.\n\nNevertheless I messaged him to see, we had an amazing conversation he got straight to the point of what we both were looking for and expecting. He tells me he's trans (not a problem for me) and he's been through all his surgeries. So we Facetime to verify and photos don't do him justice! So he set up a date for the following Friday evening.\n\nSo Friday evening came around, we met up at the restaurant only to find out they had cancelled our reservation to comply with \nCovid 19 restrictions. He tried to pay the guy at the front desk but he wasn't having any of it. So we walk out and I thought that was our date done and we'd have to schedule a new one. So we're walking out to the street, he looks at me and says \" fuck this and lets go to in and out?\" LITERALLY! By this point I'm starving so I agreed, so we walk up to his car, and it's a nice car. So nice I'm pretty sure if I sold my apartment I'm renting I still wouldn't be able to buy it.\n\nWe get in and drive to the nearest drive thru, I give my order, he gives his order, we get our food and park up. We eat and the conversation is flowing really good. I mean this guy was genuinely down to earth, he talks about him growing up in the working class back in England, how he moved and the American dream he achieved. I talk about some really sensitive topics for me and he listens even advising me what to do.\n\nSo we just stare at each other for a good 20 seconds, and then I kissed him. (never have I ever initiated something with a guy but here I go) He kissed me back, we were having a little makeout session in the car until we were honked at. So he starts up his car and looks over to me while pulling out and says \" we can go back to mine and no I don't intend on sleeping with you.... But I won't be opposed to the idea of it\" with a smile on his face you could see from a mile away. I think we both knew at this time what would happen if I went back to his. I agreed. (btw I told my friends I was going out with this guy sent them photos and his number just in case)\n\nSo we get back to his and it's a house on the hills with an amazing view and a pool. So he shows me his room, he has a large mirror hanging up so I drop my bag and I walk up to fix my hair and he walks up behind me places his hand on my lower back and just looks at me. So I won't get in every detail but we rip each our clothes off, we jump in to his bed and I pull down his boxers to find a penis that was huge but it did not feel right (to a cis mans penis),  So he explained that he had a procedure called phalloplasty which essentially is a skin graft rolled up in to something that looks like a penis, in all fairness it was pretty realistic but I was wondering why I couldn't get him erect, turns out he need an external erectile devise which was a pump stored in one of his testicles. (completely new to this) So long story short we had sex and it was amazing, talked and then went for round two.\n\nSo it's about 2 in the morning now, he looks over to me and says \"you can stay the night or I can drop you off\". So I stayed the night, he showers before bed, he asked if I would join him and I agreed. Round 3 (don't judge me) I didn't feel uncomfortable taking my makeup off infront of him, we just had that vibe if you know what I mean. He even gave me a little container for my lashes. Lol. \n\nSo we sleep, following morning came I woke up first, I watched him until he woke up. He got up and offered to make breakfast, he made french toast and English tea. It was good. Went deep in to flirtatious conversation, and then Round 4, and then round 5. \n\nThis was a couple of months back and we have just turned exclusive and I've never been happier.",
