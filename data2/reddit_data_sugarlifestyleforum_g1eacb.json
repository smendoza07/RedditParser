Platonic SDs are about as rare as Sugar Mommas. \n\n3. If you want to sell pics online to get through the pandemic, this is not a sugar relationship. This is camming, with patrons, not sugar daddies. \n\n4. The best site by far is seeking.com",

He's being stringed along, or he's a beta that has friend zoned himself\n\nType 2: he's playing the long game, and trying to get someone that wants platonic to be intimate with him\n\nType 3: (the least common), someone with sexual disfunction or health issues, most likely he still wants to have some type of intimacy with his SB. As we often see on here, so-called platonic SB that often let us know that other types of intimacy are taking place or they know the SD wants intimacy.\n\n> If sex is the main goal of any connection they're looking for, then they should just hire a prostitute.\n\nSex is not the main goal, but it is a goal of any relationship that one has with a women.  If you're statement would be true, then that would apply to all men, not just sugar daddies. Sex and companionship are the goals of any dating relationship for a healthy male. How sex is prioritized in his relationships is going to vary based on each man's sexual desire, and how he let's that desire drive his relationships.\n\n> And if we're getting technical, the true definition of a relationship is how 2 people connect. It doesn't automatically mean \"romantic couple\". A friendship is a relationship. So yeah, I believe I'm in the right place \ud83d\ude42.\n\nSemantics aside, the majority of the people here understand that a Sugar Relationship is a intimate relationship, not a friendship. Sugar relationships have been around a lot longer than you or I, or many of the people on SLF. Sugar babies have been, and always will be younger women that are in an intimate relationship with someone older and more successful, regardless of what social media, the media or anyone else says. The 0.001% of SD that really are Platonic, does not make a big enough dent in all of sugar relationships to actually be considered a thing.\n\n> Connections don't always have to involve sex.\n\nTrue, but connections that come with allowance do ;)",

You only talk to a woman every hour.  They see you, and will notice if you're soliciting.  Unless ppm is your goal, this will not work.  If you see a group of them, you can always introduce yourself to the group to see which one is thirstier than the rest.\n\nWhen flirting, it's always about them.  Compliments, questions for more about how they feel about the answers or statements they make.  Eye contact, and remember that a sugar mama is a top.  You are the bottom.  She may tell you to pull her hair or whatever, but be very aware that she's in charge of everything.\n\nNow go out there, and get after some of that ex-husband money.",

He's being stringed along, or he's a beta that has friend zoned himself\n\nType 2: he's playing the long game, and trying to get someone that wants platonic to be intimate with him\n\nType 3: (the least common), someone with sexual disfunction or health issues, most likely he still wants to have some type of intimacy with his SB. As we often see on here, so-called platonic SB that often let us know that other types of intimacy are taking place or they know the SD wants intimacy.\n\n> If sex is the main goal of any connection they're looking for, then they should just hire a prostitute.\n\nSex is not the main goal, but it is a goal of any relationship that one has with a women.  If you're statement would be true, then that would apply to all men, not just sugar daddies. Sex and companionship are the goals of any dating relationship for a healthy male. How sex is prioritized in his relationships is going to vary based on each man's sexual desire, and how he let's that desire drive his relationships.\n\n> And if we're getting technical, the true definition of a relationship is how 2 people connect. It doesn't automatically mean \"romantic couple\". A friendship is a relationship. So yeah, I believe I'm in the right place \ud83d\ude42.\n\nSemantics aside, the majority of the people here understand that a Sugar Relationship is a intimate relationship, not a friendship. Sugar relationships have been around a lot longer than you or I, or many of the people on SLF. Sugar babies have been, and always will be younger women that are in an intimate relationship with someone older and more successful, regardless of what social media, the media or anyone else says. The 0.001% of SD that really are Platonic, does not make a big enough dent in all of sugar relationships to actually be considered a thing.\n\n> Connections don't always have to involve sex.\n\nTrue, but connections that come with allowance do ;)",

He's being stringed along, or he's a beta that has friend zoned himself\n\nType 2: he's playing the long game, and trying to get someone that wants platonic to be intimate with him\n\nType 3: (the least common), someone with sexual disfunction or health issues, most likely he still wants to have some type of intimacy with his SB. As we often see on here, so-called platonic SB that often let us know that other types of intimacy are taking place or they know the SD wants intimacy.\n\n> If sex is the main goal of any connection they're looking for, then they should just hire a prostitute.\n\nSex is not the main goal, but it is a goal of any relationship that one has with a women.  If you're statement would be true, then that would apply to all men, not just sugar daddies. Sex and companionship are the goals of any dating relationship for a healthy male. How sex is prioritized in his relationships is going to vary based on each man's sexual desire, and how he let's that desire drive his relationships.\n\n> And if we're getting technical, the true definition of a relationship is how 2 people connect. It doesn't automatically mean \"romantic couple\". A friendship is a relationship. So yeah, I believe I'm in the right place \ud83d\ude42.\n\nSemantics aside, the majority of the people here understand that a Sugar Relationship is a intimate relationship, not a friendship. Sugar relationships have been around a lot longer than you or I, or many of the people on SLF. Sugar babies have been, and always will be younger women that are in an intimate relationship with someone older and more successful, regardless of what social media, the media or anyone else says. The 0.001% of SD that really are Platonic, does not make a big enough dent in all of sugar relationships to actually be considered a thing.\n\n> Connections don't always have to involve sex.\n\nTrue, but connections that come with allowance do ;)",

Compliments, questions for more about how they feel about the answers or statements they make.  Eye contact, and remember that a sugar mama is a top.  You are the bottom.  She may tell you to pull her hair or whatever, but be very aware that she's in charge of everything.\n\nNow go out there, and get after some of that ex-husband money.",

He's being stringed along, or he's a beta that has friend zoned himself\n\nType 2: he's playing the long game, and trying to get someone that wants platonic to be intimate with him\n\nType 3: (the least common), someone with sexual disfunction or health issues, most likely he still wants to have some type of intimacy with his SB. As we often see on here, so-called platonic SB that often let us know that other types of intimacy are taking place or they know the SD wants intimacy.\n\n> If sex is the main goal of any connection they're looking for, then they should just hire a prostitute.\n\nSex is not the main goal, but it is a goal of any relationship that one has with a women.  If you're statement would be true, then that would apply to all men, not just sugar daddies. Sex and companionship are the goals of any dating relationship for a healthy male. How sex is prioritized in his relationships is going to vary based on each man's sexual desire, and how he let's that desire drive his relationships.\n\n> And if we're getting technical, the true definition of a relationship is how 2 people connect. It doesn't automatically mean \"romantic couple\". A friendship is a relationship. So yeah, I believe I'm in the right place \ud83d\ude42.\n\nSemantics aside, the majority of the people here understand that a Sugar Relationship is a intimate relationship, not a friendship. Sugar relationships have been around a lot longer than you or I, or many of the people on SLF. Sugar babies have been, and always will be younger women that are in an intimate relationship with someone older and more successful, regardless of what social media, the media or anyone else says. The 0.001% of SD that really are Platonic, does not make a big enough dent in all of sugar relationships to actually be considered a thing.\n\n> Connections don't always have to involve sex.\n\nTrue, but connections that come with allowance do ;)",

He's being stringed along, or he's a beta that has friend zoned himself\n\nType 2: he's playing the long game, and trying to get someone that wants platonic to be intimate with him\n\nType 3: (the least common), someone with sexual disfunction or health issues, most likely he still wants to have some type of intimacy with his SB. As we often see on here, so-called platonic SB that often let us know that other types of intimacy are taking place or they know the SD wants intimacy.\n\n> If sex is the main goal of any connection they're looking for, then they should just hire a prostitute.\n\nSex is not the main goal, but it is a goal of any relationship that one has with a women.  If you're statement would be true, then that would apply to all men, not just sugar daddies. Sex and companionship are the goals of any dating relationship for a healthy male. How sex is prioritized in his relationships is going to vary based on each man's sexual desire, and how he let's that desire drive his relationships.\n\n> And if we're getting technical, the true definition of a relationship is how 2 people connect. It doesn't automatically mean \"romantic couple\". A friendship is a relationship. So yeah, I believe I'm in the right place \ud83d\ude42.\n\nSemantics aside, the majority of the people here understand that a Sugar Relationship is a intimate relationship, not a friendship. Sugar relationships have been around a lot longer than you or I, or many of the people on SLF. Sugar babies have been, and always will be younger women that are in an intimate relationship with someone older and more successful, regardless of what social media, the media or anyone else says. The 0.001% of SD that really are Platonic, does not make a big enough dent in all of sugar relationships to actually be considered a thing.\n\n> Connections don't always have to involve sex.\n\nTrue, but connections that come with allowance do ;)",

He's being stringed along, or he's a beta that has friend zoned himself\n\nType 2: he's playing the long game, and trying to get someone that wants platonic to be intimate with him\n\nType 3: (the least common), someone with sexual disfunction or health issues, most likely he still wants to have some type of intimacy with his SB. As we often see on here, so-called platonic SB that often let us know that other types of intimacy are taking place or they know the SD wants intimacy.\n\n> If sex is the main goal of any connection they're looking for, then they should just hire a prostitute.\n\nSex is not the main goal, but it is a goal of any relationship that one has with a women.  If you're statement would be true, then that would apply to all men, not just sugar daddies. Sex and companionship are the goals of any dating relationship for a healthy male. How sex is prioritized in his relationships is going to vary based on each man's sexual desire, and how he let's that desire drive his relationships.\n\n> And if we're getting technical, the true definition of a relationship is how 2 people connect. It doesn't automatically mean \"romantic couple\". A friendship is a relationship. So yeah, I believe I'm in the right place \ud83d\ude42.\n\nSemantics aside, the majority of the people here understand that a Sugar Relationship is a intimate relationship, not a friendship. Sugar relationships have been around a lot longer than you or I, or many of the people on SLF. Sugar babies have been, and always will be younger women that are in an intimate relationship with someone older and more successful, regardless of what social media, the media or anyone else says. The 0.001% of SD that really are Platonic, does not make a big enough dent in all of sugar relationships to actually be considered a thing.\n\n> Connections don't always have to involve sex.\n\nTrue, but connections that come with allowance do ;)",

He's being stringed along, or he's a beta that has friend zoned himself\n\nType 2: he's playing the long game, and trying to get someone that wants platonic to be intimate with him\n\nType 3: (the least common), someone with sexual disfunction or health issues, most likely he still wants to have some type of intimacy with his SB. As we often see on here, so-called platonic SB that often let us know that other types of intimacy are taking place or they know the SD wants intimacy.\n\n> If sex is the main goal of any connection they're looking for, then they should just hire a prostitute.\n\nSex is not the main goal, but it is a goal of any relationship that one has with a women.  If you're statement would be true, then that would apply to all men, not just sugar daddies. Sex and companionship are the goals of any dating relationship for a healthy male. How sex is prioritized in his relationships is going to vary based on each man's sexual desire, and how he let's that desire drive his relationships.\n\n> And if we're getting technical, the true definition of a relationship is how 2 people connect. It doesn't automatically mean \"romantic couple\". A friendship is a relationship. So yeah, I believe I'm in the right place \ud83d\ude42.\n\nSemantics aside, the majority of the people here understand that a Sugar Relationship is a intimate relationship, not a friendship. Sugar relationships have been around a lot longer than you or I, or many of the people on SLF. Sugar babies have been, and always will be younger women that are in an intimate relationship with someone older and more successful, regardless of what social media, the media or anyone else says. The 0.001% of SD that really are Platonic, does not make a big enough dent in all of sugar relationships to actually be considered a thing.\n\n> Connections don't always have to involve sex.\n\nTrue, but connections that come with allowance do ;)",

He's being stringed along, or he's a beta that has friend zoned himself\n\nType 2: he's playing the long game, and trying to get someone that wants platonic to be intimate with him\n\nType 3: (the least common), someone with sexual disfunction or health issues, most likely he still wants to have some type of intimacy with his SB. As we often see on here, so-called platonic SB that often let us know that other types of intimacy are taking place or they know the SD wants intimacy.\n\n> If sex is the main goal of any connection they're looking for, then they should just hire a prostitute.\n\nSex is not the main goal, but it is a goal of any relationship that one has with a women.  If you're statement would be true, then that would apply to all men, not just sugar daddies. Sex and companionship are the goals of any dating relationship for a healthy male. How sex is prioritized in his relationships is going to vary based on each man's sexual desire, and how he let's that desire drive his relationships.\n\n> And if we're getting technical, the true definition of a relationship is how 2 people connect. It doesn't automatically mean \"romantic couple\". A friendship is a relationship. So yeah, I believe I'm in the right place \ud83d\ude42.\n\nSemantics aside, the majority of the people here understand that a Sugar Relationship is a intimate relationship, not a friendship. Sugar relationships have been around a lot longer than you or I, or many of the people on SLF. Sugar babies have been, and always will be younger women that are in an intimate relationship with someone older and more successful, regardless of what social media, the media or anyone else says. The 0.001% of SD that really are Platonic, does not make a big enough dent in all of sugar relationships to actually be considered a thing.\n\n> Connections don't always have to involve sex.\n\nTrue, but connections that come with allowance do ;)",
