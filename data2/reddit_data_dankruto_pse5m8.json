Remember that he would die after using the 8 gates so technically he doesn't surpass Hashirama, but equal him. I would only consider characters who defeat Hashirama and stay alive after the fight.",

And naruto would still probably have enough chakra to continue fighting. \n\nMost other people have the ability to land lethal blows, but couldn\u2019t outlast his thousand healings jutsu making their lethal blows useless. I even think fan favorite Itachi falls to the might of Hashirama, because if Genjutsu was all it took to take him down then Madara wouldn\u2019t have had such a tough time.",

Hashirama doesn\u2019t stand a chance against six paths level characters in general. 8 gates guy would take him out too. Also no shit he would die after using 8 gates, that doesn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t obliterate his opponent. With you logic, 8 gates guy \u201cequals\u201d anyone he fights because he dies afterwards. He still wins the fight. His opponent loses. He kills himself.",

Go check it out. \n\nMy logic with 8 gates Guy isn't flawed. He doesn't equal everyone. If he stays alive after a fight, that is considered a win. I don't want to sound like he's weak, no, he's extremely strong. He defeated Kisame within minutes using 7 gates and stayed alive. That is clearly a win and the fight highlights how strong he is, as he killed someone with chakra rivalling tailed beasts. He's clearly high Kage level. I'd put 7 gates guy beside the sannin and 8 gates guy beside Hashirama, Madara, Sasuke and Naruto, but not beyond that since he also dies in those fights.",

So you can't say he had 0 chakra problems. \n\nIf he were to fight Hashirama, Hashirama could just use a huge wooden structure/beast in front of him so he himself could not get hit by kamui shuriken or long range kamui. Thus, no long range win for Kakashi. He needs to get close to Hashirama. His only chance would be to outright run towards Hashirama and right through anything wood lying in their path and aim any close range kamui attack on his head (he can otherwise heal). But Hashirama has enough time to make an indistinguishable wooden clone during this time so Kakashi wouldn't know where real Hashirama is. If the fight lasts any longer, Kakashi cannot sustain using DMS abilities and would definitely lose. \n\nEven if somehow Kakashi manages to teleport Hashirama to his dimension using Kamui, he cannot use his left eye ability again because if he does, he could get hit by Hashirama like Obito got hit by Kakashi.

Who in turn was stronger than Hashirama the moment rinne rebirth was activated. So basically, DMS Kakashi is infinitely faster and stronger since Hashirama doesn\u2019t scale anywhere near Kaguya.  \n\nFor Borushiki. This is weird but it works. Boro was stated to be just as, if not stronger, than Delta. Delta is the person who managed to give Adult KCM2 Naruto a tough ass time (and I know he couldn\u2019t go all out but still.) Adult KCM2 Naruto scales far above any kage in existence including Hashirama. So that means Delta is also stronger than him since she managed to hurt and react to Naruto, who again is leagues above Hashirama. So by statements, Boro is near her level making him stronger than Hashirama. And Borushiki absolutely annihilated him with a rasengan. Logical scaling: Borushiki is on the same level as Boro and Delta, who are above Hashirama",

Kaguya wasn't particularly fast or anything. She was just having too much power. And there is nothing much which shows that Kakashi was fast enough with kaguya. Now hear my points. Kakashi was fast, but not as fast as tobirama right? Yet when tobirama was attacking madara, madara dodged it. And you know that madara wasn't even in his rebirth form I think, and hashirama had been going on to fight with madara forever. So we can say that his speed is more / on par with that of madara. And in raw power Kakashi posesses a lot of jutsu, kamui and susanoo right? But hashirama can counter nirmal jutsus, can fight through kamui, and susanoo is something he has been fighting to madara with. So it's good enough I reckon",

Madara never was known for his speed. Logically he\u2019s faster than the 5 kage and just as fast as Hashirama. But Kaguya blitzed SIX PATHS SAGE MODE AND SIX PATHS SENJUTSU NARUTO ALONG WITH SIX PATHS RINNEGAN SASUKE. This is the same Naruto that dodged a beam of light point blank. All of them are now the top 3 fastest people in the Narutoverse. And Kakashi managed to blitz her. Making him the fastest character in the entire universe (excluding Borutoverse). Madara had to suck up the God tree, be the ten tails jinchuriki and have the rinnesharigan for Hagoromo to say \u201coh he\u2019s getting close to my moms power\u201d meaning he wasn\u2019t even on Kaguya\u2019s level yet. And Kakashi BLITZED HER. There\u2019s nothing to argue. Unless you can prove that EMS Madara is faster than SO6P Naruto, Rinnegan Sasuke and Kaguya, then I\u2019ve won here. Btw, they\u2019re all relativistic in speed so good luck scaling Madara. Dude is at best lightning speed and even I doubt he\u2019s that fast in EMS",

Proven by Tobirama saying he was close to his old form when Orochimaru brought him back. Have you noticed that both Kabuto and Orochimaru have never said \u201cyou\u2019re stronger than when you were alive\u201d ? Because they aren\u2019t. Alive Tobirama wins against Edo Tobirama. Because edo was brought back at 80% while Alive Tobirama is 100% since he\u2019s himself. \nAnother example is the exchange between Kabuto and Madara, Kabuto states he brought him near \u201chis glory days\u201d form. Where Madara says Kabuto knows nothing of his glory days. \n\nSecond of all, edo Madara- with the rinnegan- stalemated edo Hashirama. While when they were alive, there was a victor.  And no, it\u2019s not because EMS Madara was weaker during VoTE. As I previously said, no edo is brought back at full strength. So,by simple logic, EMS Madara is stronger than his edo self.\nRinne rebirth Madara had to absorb Hashirama\u2019s sage mode, for Hashirama to say \u201che\u2019s gaining his past strength\u201d. And this was after the edo fight between both of them. Meaning even he realized that they weren\u2019t at their peak \n\nIf you aren\u2019t at 100% if your capabilities, then you aren\u2019t as fast nor as strong as you are at 80-90%",

[She already proves this by reacting to Amenjotejikara + Chidori point blank, the usage of exclamation marks is to show that she's perceived him](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/vsbattles/images/1/13/Naruto-5082851.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170406204459). She is incredibly fast.\n\nIn the scan I linked originally, she has a six paths enhanced byakugan(reason I say enhanced and not ordinary is because it's stated six paths chakra enhances ocular powers) active with 360 degree vision, she actually reacts to, and perceives Sakura. This is denoted by the \"!\": her durability is therefore not affected as she's not struck while \"off guard\" by Sakura because she knew Sakura was above about to strike.\n\n>is konohamaru a god because he defeated a pain by surprise?\n\nOne path of pain is fodder in the grand scheme of things. (Unless Tendo)",

Zetsu stated Kaguya was getting exponentially stronger by the moment so it is tricky to work out how strong Kaguya is relative to Naruto/Sasuke at various points during the fight, or that Naruto/Sasuke even scale to her in speed after a certain point. For the sake of simplicity and clarity I'd probably say throughout the fight Kaguya was \\~ to Naruto/Sasuke as a pair.\n\n>*sakura isnt even strongest kunoichi*\n\nThis is right, Kurotsuchi is as of the Momoshiki fight. Sakura was not considered when Shikamaru stated that the warriors sent to retrieve Naruto were the strongest available. This could potentially be debunked via Shin scaling however & drawing into question whether Shikamaru knows how strong Sakura currently is since she's pretty much not fighting anymore & Kurotsuchi is a kage.\n\n>*speed of punch*\n\nNot true, the chidori draws out the users maximum speed to the point of tunnel vision, hence why it's only feasible with the sharingan. [Chidori is in effect a temporary speed amp](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11134/111341899/7360382-2889434371-0114-.png).\n\n[Source 1](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EROnMhPXkAMvb3b.jpg) on it's feasibility, [Source 2](https://imgur.com/8VJkYd4) on it's speed, [Source 3, speed of the thrust itself being insane](https://imgur.com/Xo6VrSl).\n\n>*wood style drains chakra*\n\nThese abilities are irrelevant when taking into account Sakura's sheer speed displayed in the Kaguya feat. She is faster than Hashirama is, and via the SPSM Shadow Clone scaling arguably just outright has higher AP(maybe a weaker argument than the others I proposed). There's an alternate means of scaling her to be faster than Hashirama via her being \\~ to KCM2(or even really KCM1, same result). In short, she would have to be caught in the wood dragon which is very unlikely.\n\n>*hinata will win because she block chakra*\n\nShe gets blitzed before even landing a single hit. Her speed feats in the WA are subpar compared to Sakura.\n\nSakura isn't going to totally stomp/one shot, she has a decent shot at beating Hashirama is what i'm saying\n\nEdit:\n\nOn another note, having someone not just say sakuratard/idiot and actually want to discuss this is nice & unexpected, thank you. Pretty cool discussion",

Let me be clear ...Killer bee also gets mopped by hashirama.",

But if Hashirama gets trapped in that huge ass water bubble what\u2019s he gonna do? Just hold his breath the whole fight??? I don\u2019t think Hashirama has experience fighting someone as proficient with Water Release as Kisame. And that is the bulk of the point I\u2019m making. Also, it only take a few exchanges with samehada for Kisame to have taken some of Hashirama\u2019s chakra. Maybe he can\u2019t use it because Hashirama\u2019s life force/chakra is hard to control. But that does mean it is being taken from him. And once Kisame and samehada fuse Kisame can take chakra with his body in addition to his water shark jutsu. I think hashirama wins. Neither one of us has even considered senjutsu because that\u2019s clearly an easy win. But I think Kisame can definitely last some rounds. And may even put hashirama in a predicament if he assumes Kisame is fodder. \n\nOkay okay fuck that final villain shit. There\u2019s an exponential jump between 7 gates and 8 gates. We saw 8 gates guy obliterate jubi-Madara. Yes I know Madara regens and guy should die. However, if guy woke up one morning and had breakfast, then immediately went somewhere to fight hashirama i think 7 Gates would also put mad pressure on hashirama. He\u2019s still human, so if guy when 7 Gates and went full tilt hashirama is definitely fighting. Like no one beneath this level of combat is worth a fight to hashirama. I think it\u2019s silly to think that 7 gates guy ISN\u2019T TOUCHING Hashirama. What about guy fighting the reanimated jinjuriki and obito with bee, Naruto, and Kakashi? Clearly guy is in a league of his own with 7 gates. If he attacks non stop he\u2019s definitely pressuring Hashirama.",

Hashirama is a veteran who has faced foes far deadlier than kisame and gai. The moment kisame / samehada try to take in hashirama's  chakra it's a wrap. They will die by themselves before hashirama gets a chance to start fighting. \n\nHashirama getting trapped in that \" huge ass water bubble\" only makes things easier for him. He can create and protude wood style out of nowhere. Kisame is going to die in this bubble.  The wooden golem is so powerful that it changes the world map upon each use. That's the scope of it's destruction. \n\nSenjutsu is not something I forgot. Because Hashirama can beat kisame comfortably without ever needing to use it. The amount of raw chakra hashirama has is more than kisame. Also an expert at sealing jutsus if that was not enough. \n\nThe entirety of ur Gai's argument is moot. Gai is much more of a human than hashirama. Hashirama will simply outlast 7 gates gai since he's most likely inferior to gai when it comes to taijutsu.  It's not a fair fight buddy. \n\n\nEdit : The best water release expert in the history of Shinobi world was Tobirama senju. Hashirama's younger brother. He would mop the floor with kisame using his own jutsus.  There is nothing kisame can do that will surprise hashirama much less concern him. \n\nThe only thing kisame has over hashirama are stronger teeth for biting and chewing food. That and maybe a better toned upper body idk.",

If we depended on power scaling alone, then Naruto wouldn't have survived his earlier battles because he's bested his opponents who were far more superior and experienced than he is during the time of those battles.

I don\u2019t wanna argue but personally I am of the opinion that naruto is stronger than hashirama and due to his near limitless chakra is probably one of the only people that can fight hashirama until his thousand healings jutsu wears off. And naruto would still probably have enough chakra to continue fighting. \n\nMost other people have the ability to land lethal blows, but couldn\u2019t outlast his thousand healings jutsu making their lethal blows useless. I even think fan favorite Itachi falls to the might of Hashirama, because if Genjutsu was all it took to take him down then Madara wouldn\u2019t have had such a tough time.",

He doesn't equal everyone. If he stays alive after a fight, that is considered a win. I don't want to sound like he's weak, no, he's extremely strong. He defeated Kisame within minutes using 7 gates and stayed alive. That is clearly a win and the fight highlights how strong he is, as he killed someone with chakra rivalling tailed beasts. He's clearly high Kage level. I'd put 7 gates guy beside the sannin and 8 gates guy beside Hashirama, Madara, Sasuke and Naruto, but not beyond that since he also dies in those fights.",

But, he only proved that Kakashi was extremely fast, and that he received some 6 paths chakra as well from Obito. Everything else was his opinion which doesn't count. \n\n6 paths chakra makes Kakashi extremely broken, yes, maybe stronger than Hashirama, but Kakashi would still lose in a battle against Hashirama as he will lose his power very soon. Hashirama only needs to waste a little bit of time and when Kakashi is out of chakra, he can crush him. \n\nThere's a whole thread down here where I explained in detail how the fight would go so I would refer you to read it as well.",

Here's how it went: \n\nKakashi uses Susanoo, catches Sakura, uses 1 kamui shuriken attack, uses right eye ability to save himself, Susanoo gone, 1 kamui lightning blade and 1 left eye ability. \n\nAll this lasted only a few minutes and when they returned, he literally collapsed due to sharingan use. So you can't say he had 0 chakra problems. \n\nIf he were to fight Hashirama, Hashirama could just use a huge wooden structure/beast in front of him so he himself could not get hit by kamui shuriken or long range kamui. Thus, no long range win for Kakashi. He needs to get close to Hashirama. His only chance would be to outright run towards Hashirama and right through anything wood lying in their path and aim any close range kamui attack on his head (he can otherwise heal). But Hashirama has enough time to make an indistinguishable wooden clone during this time so Kakashi wouldn't know where real Hashirama is. If the fight lasts any longer, Kakashi cannot sustain using DMS abilities and would definitely lose. \n\nEven if somehow Kakashi manages to teleport Hashirama to his dimension using Kamui, he cannot use his left eye ability again because if he does, he could get hit by Hashirama like Obito got hit by Kakashi. Thus, teleporting alone does not count as a win.",

All it takes is literally one of any of his kamui moves and hashirama\u2019s done. There\u2019s literally nothing he can do to hurt kakashi either. Hashirama is probably only strong enough to beat alive madara without rinnegan (definitely not storng enough to beat juubi madara).

Boro was stated to be just as, if not stronger, than Delta. Delta is the person who managed to give Adult KCM2 Naruto a tough ass time (and I know he couldn\u2019t go all out but still.) Adult KCM2 Naruto scales far above any kage in existence including Hashirama. So that means Delta is also stronger than him since she managed to hurt and react to Naruto, who again is leagues above Hashirama. So by statements, Boro is near her level making him stronger than Hashirama. And Borushiki absolutely annihilated him with a rasengan. Logical scaling: Borushiki is on the same level as Boro and Delta, who are above Hashirama",

Kaguya wasn't particularly fast or anything. She was just having too much power. And there is nothing much which shows that Kakashi was fast enough with kaguya. Now hear my points. Kakashi was fast, but not as fast as tobirama right? Yet when tobirama was attacking madara, madara dodged it. And you know that madara wasn't even in his rebirth form I think, and hashirama had been going on to fight with madara forever. So we can say that his speed is more / on par with that of madara. And in raw power Kakashi posesses a lot of jutsu, kamui and susanoo right? But hashirama can counter nirmal jutsus, can fight through kamui, and susanoo is something he has been fighting to madara with. So it's good enough I reckon",

Logically he\u2019s faster than the 5 kage and just as fast as Hashirama. But Kaguya blitzed SIX PATHS SAGE MODE AND SIX PATHS SENJUTSU NARUTO ALONG WITH SIX PATHS RINNEGAN SASUKE. This is the same Naruto that dodged a beam of light point blank. All of them are now the top 3 fastest people in the Narutoverse. And Kakashi managed to blitz her. Making him the fastest character in the entire universe (excluding Borutoverse). Madara had to suck up the God tree, be the ten tails jinchuriki and have the rinnesharigan for Hagoromo to say \u201coh he\u2019s getting close to my moms power\u201d meaning he wasn\u2019t even on Kaguya\u2019s level yet. And Kakashi BLITZED HER. There\u2019s nothing to argue. Unless you can prove that EMS Madara is faster than SO6P Naruto, Rinnegan Sasuke and Kaguya, then I\u2019ve won here. Btw, they\u2019re all relativistic in speed so good luck scaling Madara. Dude is at best lightning speed and even I doubt he\u2019s that fast in EMS",

Have you noticed that both Kabuto and Orochimaru have never said \u201cyou\u2019re stronger than when you were alive\u201d ? Because they aren\u2019t. Alive Tobirama wins against Edo Tobirama. Because edo was brought back at 80% while Alive Tobirama is 100% since he\u2019s himself. \nAnother example is the exchange between Kabuto and Madara, Kabuto states he brought him near \u201chis glory days\u201d form. Where Madara says Kabuto knows nothing of his glory days. \n\nSecond of all, edo Madara- with the rinnegan- stalemated edo Hashirama. While when they were alive, there was a victor.  And no, it\u2019s not because EMS Madara was weaker during VoTE. As I previously said, no edo is brought back at full strength. So,by simple logic, EMS Madara is stronger than his edo self.\nRinne rebirth Madara had to absorb Hashirama\u2019s sage mode, for Hashirama to say \u201che\u2019s gaining his past strength\u201d. And this was after the edo fight between both of them. Meaning even he realized that they weren\u2019t at their peak \n\nIf you aren\u2019t at 100% if your capabilities, then you aren\u2019t as fast nor as strong as you are at 80-90%",

[She already proves this by reacting to Amenjotejikara + Chidori point blank, the usage of exclamation marks is to show that she's perceived him](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/vsbattles/images/1/13/Naruto-5082851.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170406204459). She is incredibly fast.\n\nIn the scan I linked originally, she has a six paths enhanced byakugan(reason I say enhanced and not ordinary is because it's stated six paths chakra enhances ocular powers) active with 360 degree vision, she actually reacts to, and perceives Sakura. This is denoted by the \"!\": her durability is therefore not affected as she's not struck while \"off guard\" by Sakura because she knew Sakura was above about to strike.\n\n>is konohamaru a god because he defeated a pain by surprise?\n\nOne path of pain is fodder in the grand scheme of things. (Unless Tendo)",

Did I say she's stronger than **everybody**? She's obviously not stronger than SPSM Naruto's original body, Kaguya, Rinnegan Sasuke as I didn't prove she actually scales to them. I made a case for her being able to beat Hashirama.\n\nKaguya is wielding the Byakugan and has proven she's at the level of being able to physically blitz Sasuke and Naruto at several points. [She already proves this by reacting to Amenjotejikara + Chidori point blank, the usage of exclamation marks is to show that she's perceived him](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/vsbattles/images/1/13/Naruto-5082851.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170406204459). She is incredibly fast.\n\nIn the scan I linked originally, she has a six paths enhanced byakugan(reason I say enhanced and not ordinary is because it's stated six paths chakra enhances ocular powers) active with 360 degree vision, she actually reacts to, and perceives Sakura. This is denoted by the \"!\": her durability is therefore not affected as she's not struck while \"off guard\" by Sakura because she knew Sakura was above about to strike.",

Zetsu stated Kaguya was getting exponentially stronger by the moment so it is tricky to work out how strong Kaguya is relative to Naruto/Sasuke at various points during the fight, or that Naruto/Sasuke even scale to her in speed after a certain point. For the sake of simplicity and clarity I'd probably say throughout the fight Kaguya was \\~ to Naruto/Sasuke as a pair.\n\n>*sakura isnt even strongest kunoichi*\n\nThis is right, Kurotsuchi is as of the Momoshiki fight. Sakura was not considered when Shikamaru stated that the warriors sent to retrieve Naruto were the strongest available. This could potentially be debunked via Shin scaling however & drawing into question whether Shikamaru knows how strong Sakura currently is since she's pretty much not fighting anymore & Kurotsuchi is a kage.\n\n>*speed of punch*\n\nNot true, the chidori draws out the users maximum speed to the point of tunnel vision, hence why it's only feasible with the sharingan. [Chidori is in effect a temporary speed amp](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11134/111341899/7360382-2889434371-0114-.png).\n\n[Source 1](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EROnMhPXkAMvb3b.jpg) on it's feasibility, [Source 2](https://imgur.com/8VJkYd4) on it's speed, [Source 3, speed of the thrust itself being insane](https://imgur.com/Xo6VrSl).\n\n>*wood style drains chakra*\n\nThese abilities are irrelevant when taking into account Sakura's sheer speed displayed in the Kaguya feat. She is faster than Hashirama is, and via the SPSM Shadow Clone scaling arguably just outright has higher AP(maybe a weaker argument than the others I proposed). There's an alternate means of scaling her to be faster than Hashirama via her being \\~ to KCM2(or even really KCM1, same result). In short, she would have to be caught in the wood dragon which is very unlikely.\n\n>*hinata will win because she block chakra*\n\nShe gets blitzed before even landing a single hit. Her speed feats in the WA are subpar compared to Sakura.\n\nSakura isn't going to totally stomp/one shot, she has a decent shot at beating Hashirama is what i'm saying\n\nEdit:\n\nOn another note, having someone not just say sakuratard/idiot and actually want to discuss this is nice & unexpected, thank you.

Kisame is not touching hashirama. Itachi , Minato,  Obito and even pain are not beating hashirama lmao.  Forget hashirama. The names I mentioned are not gonna beat Madara either. Hashirama's life force is almost godly. Water style is also the worst element against hashirama followed by earth.  Want him to take you atleast 1% seriously ? Try fire / wind. \n\nAs for gai. Your argument makes zero sense. \"Everyone thought he was the final villain\" . Dafaq is that supposed to mean ?  You think gai would have held back had he known kaguyas existence or zetsu's plan ?  8 gates gai ragdolled jubi madra for a min and went bye bye. Thanks to Naruto's seal gai lived to see the day. Permanently disabled. \n\n7 gates gai is not touching hashirama. He does slightly better than kisame before biting the dust. 8 gates gai kills hashirama and dies shortly after.\n\nEdit : you mentioned killer bee in ur post. Let me be clear ...Killer bee also gets mopped by hashirama.",

But if Hashirama gets trapped in that huge ass water bubble what\u2019s he gonna do? Just hold his breath the whole fight??? I don\u2019t think Hashirama has experience fighting someone as proficient with Water Release as Kisame. And that is the bulk of the point I\u2019m making. Also, it only take a few exchanges with samehada for Kisame to have taken some of Hashirama\u2019s chakra. Maybe he can\u2019t use it because Hashirama\u2019s life force/chakra is hard to control. But that does mean it is being taken from him. And once Kisame and samehada fuse Kisame can take chakra with his body in addition to his water shark jutsu. I think hashirama wins. Neither one of us has even considered senjutsu because that\u2019s clearly an easy win. But I think Kisame can definitely last some rounds. And may even put hashirama in a predicament if he assumes Kisame is fodder. \n\nOkay okay fuck that final villain shit. There\u2019s an exponential jump between 7 gates and 8 gates. We saw 8 gates guy obliterate jubi-Madara. Yes I know Madara regens and guy should die. However, if guy woke up one morning and had breakfast, then immediately went somewhere to fight hashirama i think 7 Gates would also put mad pressure on hashirama. He\u2019s still human, so if guy when 7 Gates and went full tilt hashirama is definitely fighting. Like no one beneath this level of combat is worth a fight to hashirama. I think it\u2019s silly to think that 7 gates guy ISN\u2019T TOUCHING Hashirama. What about guy fighting the reanimated jinjuriki and obito with bee, Naruto, and Kakashi? Clearly guy is in a league of his own with 7 gates. If he attacks non stop he\u2019s definitely pressuring Hashirama.",

Hashirama is a veteran who has faced foes far deadlier than kisame and gai. The moment kisame / samehada try to take in hashirama's  chakra it's a wrap. They will die by themselves before hashirama gets a chance to start fighting. \n\nHashirama getting trapped in that \" huge ass water bubble\" only makes things easier for him. He can create and protude wood style out of nowhere. Kisame is going to die in this bubble.  The wooden golem is so powerful that it changes the world map upon each use. That's the scope of it's destruction. \n\nSenjutsu is not something I forgot. Because Hashirama can beat kisame comfortably without ever needing to use it. The amount of raw chakra hashirama has is more than kisame. Also an expert at sealing jutsus if that was not enough. \n\nThe entirety of ur Gai's argument is moot. Gai is much more of a human than hashirama. Hashirama will simply outlast 7 gates gai since he's most likely inferior to gai when it comes to taijutsu.  It's not a fair fight buddy. \n\n\nEdit : The best water release expert in the history of Shinobi world was Tobirama senju. Hashirama's younger brother. He would mop the floor with kisame using his own jutsus.  There is nothing kisame can do that will surprise hashirama much less concern him. \n\nThe only thing kisame has over hashirama are stronger teeth for biting and chewing food. That and maybe a better toned upper body idk.",

Id love to see how Kishi would weigh in on this. I know a lot of people hang on to power scalers on YT, but I don't think they're the end all, be all of Naruto knowledge. If we depended on power scaling alone, then Naruto wouldn't have survived his earlier battles because he's bested his opponents who were far more superior and experienced than he is during the time of those battles. We often neglect battle experience when vs battles come up.",

I don\u2019t wanna argue but personally I am of the opinion that naruto is stronger than hashirama and due to his near limitless chakra is probably one of the only people that can fight hashirama until his thousand healings jutsu wears off. And naruto would still probably have enough chakra to continue fighting. \n\nMost other people have the ability to land lethal blows, but couldn\u2019t outlast his thousand healings jutsu making their lethal blows useless. I even think fan favorite Itachi falls to the might of Hashirama, because if Genjutsu was all it took to take him down then Madara wouldn\u2019t have had such a tough time.",

Also no shit he would die after using 8 gates, that doesn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t obliterate his opponent. With you logic, 8 gates guy \u201cequals\u201d anyone he fights because he dies afterwards. He still wins the fight. His opponent loses. He kills himself.",

He doesn't equal everyone. If he stays alive after a fight, that is considered a win. I don't want to sound like he's weak, no, he's extremely strong. He defeated Kisame within minutes using 7 gates and stayed alive. That is clearly a win and the fight highlights how strong he is, as he killed someone with chakra rivalling tailed beasts. He's clearly high Kage level. I'd put 7 gates guy beside the sannin and 8 gates guy beside Hashirama, Madara, Sasuke and Naruto, but not beyond that since he also dies in those fights.",

So you can't say he had 0 chakra problems. \n\nIf he were to fight Hashirama, Hashirama could just use a huge wooden structure/beast in front of him so he himself could not get hit by kamui shuriken or long range kamui. Thus, no long range win for Kakashi. He needs to get close to Hashirama. His only chance would be to outright run towards Hashirama and right through anything wood lying in their path and aim any close range kamui attack on his head (he can otherwise heal). But Hashirama has enough time to make an indistinguishable wooden clone during this time so Kakashi wouldn't know where real Hashirama is. If the fight lasts any longer, Kakashi cannot sustain using DMS abilities and would definitely lose. \n\nEven if somehow Kakashi manages to teleport Hashirama to his dimension using Kamui, he cannot use his left eye ability again because if he does, he could get hit by Hashirama like Obito got hit by Kakashi.

Meanwhile hashirama as a reanimation with nerfed abilities  pinned down the 10 tails for a while by himself. Let's not sleep on EMS Madara since we all know how strong 9 tails is, and how strong a perfect susano is. By your logic Sakura beats hashirama. Maybe if we super wank Kakashi to have permanent DMS (which would be a stretch.) But idk, I think your just downplaying hashirama a lot.",

All it takes is literally one of any of his kamui moves and hashirama\u2019s done. There\u2019s literally nothing he can do to hurt kakashi either. Hashirama is probably only strong enough to beat alive madara without rinnegan (definitely not storng enough to beat juubi madara).

Boro was stated to be just as, if not stronger, than Delta. Delta is the person who managed to give Adult KCM2 Naruto a tough ass time (and I know he couldn\u2019t go all out but still.) Adult KCM2 Naruto scales far above any kage in existence including Hashirama. So that means Delta is also stronger than him since she managed to hurt and react to Naruto, who again is leagues above Hashirama. So by statements, Boro is near her level making him stronger than Hashirama. And Borushiki absolutely annihilated him with a rasengan. Logical scaling: Borushiki is on the same level as Boro and Delta, who are above Hashirama",

She was just having too much power. And there is nothing much which shows that Kakashi was fast enough with kaguya. Now hear my points. Kakashi was fast, but not as fast as tobirama right? Yet when tobirama was attacking madara, madara dodged it. And you know that madara wasn't even in his rebirth form I think, and hashirama had been going on to fight with madara forever. So we can say that his speed is more / on par with that of madara. And in raw power Kakashi posesses a lot of jutsu, kamui and susanoo right? But hashirama can counter nirmal jutsus, can fight through kamui, and susanoo is something he has been fighting to madara with. So it's good enough I reckon",

This is the same Naruto that dodged a beam of light point blank. All of them are now the top 3 fastest people in the Narutoverse. And Kakashi managed to blitz her. Making him the fastest character in the entire universe (excluding Borutoverse). Madara had to suck up the God tree, be the ten tails jinchuriki and have the rinnesharigan for Hagoromo to say \u201coh he\u2019s getting close to my moms power\u201d meaning he wasn\u2019t even on Kaguya\u2019s level yet. And Kakashi BLITZED HER. There\u2019s nothing to argue. Unless you can prove that EMS Madara is faster than SO6P Naruto, Rinnegan Sasuke and Kaguya, then I\u2019ve won here. Btw, they\u2019re all relativistic in speed so good luck scaling Madara. Dude is at best lightning speed and even I doubt he\u2019s that fast in EMS",

Because edo was brought back at 80% while Alive Tobirama is 100% since he\u2019s himself. \nAnother example is the exchange between Kabuto and Madara, Kabuto states he brought him near \u201chis glory days\u201d form. Where Madara says Kabuto knows nothing of his glory days. \n\nSecond of all, edo Madara- with the rinnegan- stalemated edo Hashirama. While when they were alive, there was a victor.  And no, it\u2019s not because EMS Madara was weaker during VoTE. As I previously said, no edo is brought back at full strength. So,by simple logic, EMS Madara is stronger than his edo self.\nRinne rebirth Madara had to absorb Hashirama\u2019s sage mode, for Hashirama to say \u201che\u2019s gaining his past strength\u201d. And this was after the edo fight between both of them. Meaning even he realized that they weren\u2019t at their peak \n\nIf you aren\u2019t at 100% if your capabilities, then you aren\u2019t as fast nor as strong as you are at 80-90%",

[She already proves this by reacting to Amenjotejikara + Chidori point blank, the usage of exclamation marks is to show that she's perceived him](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/vsbattles/images/1/13/Naruto-5082851.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170406204459). She is incredibly fast.\n\nIn the scan I linked originally, she has a six paths enhanced byakugan(reason I say enhanced and not ordinary is because it's stated six paths chakra enhances ocular powers) active with 360 degree vision, she actually reacts to, and perceives Sakura. This is denoted by the \"!\": her durability is therefore not affected as she's not struck while \"off guard\" by Sakura because she knew Sakura was above about to strike.\n\n>is konohamaru a god because he defeated a pain by surprise?\n\nOne path of pain is fodder in the grand scheme of things. (Unless Tendo)",

Did I say she's stronger than **everybody**? She's obviously not stronger than SPSM Naruto's original body, Kaguya, Rinnegan Sasuke as I didn't prove she actually scales to them. I made a case for her being able to beat Hashirama.\n\nKaguya is wielding the Byakugan and has proven she's at the level of being able to physically blitz Sasuke and Naruto at several points. [She already proves this by reacting to Amenjotejikara + Chidori point blank, the usage of exclamation marks is to show that she's perceived him](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/vsbattles/images/1/13/Naruto-5082851.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170406204459). She is incredibly fast.\n\nIn the scan I linked originally, she has a six paths enhanced byakugan(reason I say enhanced and not ordinary is because it's stated six paths chakra enhances ocular powers) active with 360 degree vision, she actually reacts to, and perceives Sakura. This is denoted by the \"!\": her durability is therefore not affected as she's not struck while \"off guard\" by Sakura because she knew Sakura was above about to strike.",

Zetsu stated Kaguya was getting exponentially stronger by the moment so it is tricky to work out how strong Kaguya is relative to Naruto/Sasuke at various points during the fight, or that Naruto/Sasuke even scale to her in speed after a certain point. For the sake of simplicity and clarity I'd probably say throughout the fight Kaguya was \\~ to Naruto/Sasuke as a pair.\n\n>*sakura isnt even strongest kunoichi*\n\nThis is right, Kurotsuchi is as of the Momoshiki fight. Sakura was not considered when Shikamaru stated that the warriors sent to retrieve Naruto were the strongest available. This could potentially be debunked via Shin scaling however & drawing into question whether Shikamaru knows how strong Sakura currently is since she's pretty much not fighting anymore & Kurotsuchi is a kage.\n\n>*speed of punch*\n\nNot true, the chidori draws out the users maximum speed to the point of tunnel vision, hence why it's only feasible with the sharingan. [Chidori is in effect a temporary speed amp](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11134/111341899/7360382-2889434371-0114-.png).\n\n[Source 1](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EROnMhPXkAMvb3b.jpg) on it's feasibility, [Source 2](https://imgur.com/8VJkYd4) on it's speed, [Source 3, speed of the thrust itself being insane](https://imgur.com/Xo6VrSl).\n\n>*wood style drains chakra*\n\nThese abilities are irrelevant when taking into account Sakura's sheer speed displayed in the Kaguya feat. She is faster than Hashirama is, and via the SPSM Shadow Clone scaling arguably just outright has higher AP(maybe a weaker argument than the others I proposed). There's an alternate means of scaling her to be faster than Hashirama via her being \\~ to KCM2(or even really KCM1, same result). In short, she would have to be caught in the wood dragon which is very unlikely.\n\n>*hinata will win because she block chakra*\n\nShe gets blitzed before even landing a single hit. Her speed feats in the WA are subpar compared to Sakura.\n\nSakura isn't going to totally stomp/one shot, she has a decent shot at beating Hashirama is what i'm saying\n\nEdit:\n\nOn another note, having someone not just say sakuratard/idiot and actually want to discuss this is nice & unexpected, thank you. Pretty cool discussion",

Hashirama's life force is almost godly. Water style is also the worst element against hashirama followed by earth.  Want him to take you atleast 1% seriously ? Try fire / wind. \n\nAs for gai. Your argument makes zero sense. \"Everyone thought he was the final villain\" . Dafaq is that supposed to mean ?  You think gai would have held back had he known kaguyas existence or zetsu's plan ?  8 gates gai ragdolled jubi madra for a min and went bye bye. Thanks to Naruto's seal gai lived to see the day. Permanently disabled. \n\n7 gates gai is not touching hashirama. He does slightly better than kisame before biting the dust. 8 gates gai kills hashirama and dies shortly after.\n\nEdit : you mentioned killer bee in ur post. Let me be clear ...Killer bee also gets mopped by hashirama.",

But if Hashirama gets trapped in that huge ass water bubble what\u2019s he gonna do? Just hold his breath the whole fight??? I don\u2019t think Hashirama has experience fighting someone as proficient with Water Release as Kisame. And that is the bulk of the point I\u2019m making. Also, it only take a few exchanges with samehada for Kisame to have taken some of Hashirama\u2019s chakra. Maybe he can\u2019t use it because Hashirama\u2019s life force/chakra is hard to control. But that does mean it is being taken from him. And once Kisame and samehada fuse Kisame can take chakra with his body in addition to his water shark jutsu. I think hashirama wins. Neither one of us has even considered senjutsu because that\u2019s clearly an easy win. But I think Kisame can definitely last some rounds. And may even put hashirama in a predicament if he assumes Kisame is fodder. \n\nOkay okay fuck that final villain shit. There\u2019s an exponential jump between 7 gates and 8 gates. We saw 8 gates guy obliterate jubi-Madara. Yes I know Madara regens and guy should die. However, if guy woke up one morning and had breakfast, then immediately went somewhere to fight hashirama i think 7 Gates would also put mad pressure on hashirama. He\u2019s still human, so if guy when 7 Gates and went full tilt hashirama is definitely fighting. Like no one beneath this level of combat is worth a fight to hashirama. I think it\u2019s silly to think that 7 gates guy ISN\u2019T TOUCHING Hashirama. What about guy fighting the reanimated jinjuriki and obito with bee, Naruto, and Kakashi? Clearly guy is in a league of his own with 7 gates. If he attacks non stop he\u2019s definitely pressuring Hashirama.",

Hashirama is a veteran who has faced foes far deadlier than kisame and gai. The moment kisame / samehada try to take in hashirama's  chakra it's a wrap. They will die by themselves before hashirama gets a chance to start fighting. \n\nHashirama getting trapped in that \" huge ass water bubble\" only makes things easier for him. He can create and protude wood style out of nowhere. Kisame is going to die in this bubble.  The wooden golem is so powerful that it changes the world map upon each use. That's the scope of it's destruction. \n\nSenjutsu is not something I forgot. Because Hashirama can beat kisame comfortably without ever needing to use it. The amount of raw chakra hashirama has is more than kisame. Also an expert at sealing jutsus if that was not enough. \n\nThe entirety of ur Gai's argument is moot. Gai is much more of a human than hashirama. Hashirama will simply outlast 7 gates gai since he's most likely inferior to gai when it comes to taijutsu.  It's not a fair fight buddy. \n\n\nEdit : The best water release expert in the history of Shinobi world was Tobirama senju. Hashirama's younger brother. He would mop the floor with kisame using his own jutsus.  There is nothing kisame can do that will surprise hashirama much less concern him. \n\nThe only thing kisame has over hashirama are stronger teeth for biting and chewing food. That and maybe a better toned upper body idk.",

Honestly, I give Hashirama the edge because of his healing abilities, and I think it would be a battle of attrition that Hiruzen may not survive because of those abilities. Id love to see how Kishi would weigh in on this. I know a lot of people hang on to power scalers on YT, but I don't think they're the end all, be all of Naruto knowledge. If we depended on power scaling alone, then Naruto wouldn't have survived his earlier battles because he's bested his opponents who were far more superior and experienced than he is during the time of those battles. We often neglect battle experience when vs battles come up.",

I don\u2019t wanna argue but personally I am of the opinion that naruto is stronger than hashirama and due to his near limitless chakra is probably one of the only people that can fight hashirama until his thousand healings jutsu wears off. And naruto would still probably have enough chakra to continue fighting. \n\nMost other people have the ability to land lethal blows, but couldn\u2019t outlast his thousand healings jutsu making their lethal blows useless. I even think fan favorite Itachi falls to the might of Hashirama, because if Genjutsu was all it took to take him down then Madara wouldn\u2019t have had such a tough time.",

He defeated Kisame within minutes using 7 gates and stayed alive. That is clearly a win and the fight highlights how strong he is, as he killed someone with chakra rivalling tailed beasts. He's clearly high Kage level. I'd put 7 gates guy beside the sannin and 8 gates guy beside Hashirama, Madara, Sasuke and Naruto, but not beyond that since he also dies in those fights.",

Everything else was his opinion which doesn't count. \n\n6 paths chakra makes Kakashi extremely broken, yes, maybe stronger than Hashirama, but Kakashi would still lose in a battle against Hashirama as he will lose his power very soon. Hashirama only needs to waste a little bit of time and when Kakashi is out of chakra, he can crush him. \n\nThere's a whole thread down here where I explained in detail how the fight would go so I would refer you to read it as well.",

Here's how it went: \n\nKakashi uses Susanoo, catches Sakura, uses 1 kamui shuriken attack, uses right eye ability to save himself, Susanoo gone, 1 kamui lightning blade and 1 left eye ability. \n\nAll this lasted only a few minutes and when they returned, he literally collapsed due to sharingan use. So you can't say he had 0 chakra problems. \n\nIf he were to fight Hashirama, Hashirama could just use a huge wooden structure/beast in front of him so he himself could not get hit by kamui shuriken or long range kamui. Thus, no long range win for Kakashi. He needs to get close to Hashirama. His only chance would be to outright run towards Hashirama and right through anything wood lying in their path and aim any close range kamui attack on his head (he can otherwise heal). But Hashirama has enough time to make an indistinguishable wooden clone during this time so Kakashi wouldn't know where real Hashirama is. If the fight lasts any longer, Kakashi cannot sustain using DMS abilities and would definitely lose. \n\nEven if somehow Kakashi manages to teleport Hashirama to his dimension using Kamui, he cannot use his left eye ability again because if he does, he could get hit by Hashirama like Obito got hit by Kakashi. Thus, teleporting alone does not count as a win.",

Meanwhile hashirama as a reanimation with nerfed abilities  pinned down the 10 tails for a while by himself. Let's not sleep on EMS Madara since we all know how strong 9 tails is, and how strong a perfect susano is. By your logic Sakura beats hashirama. Maybe if we super wank Kakashi to have permanent DMS (which would be a stretch.) But idk, I think your just downplaying hashirama a lot.",

All it takes is literally one of any of his kamui moves and hashirama\u2019s done. There\u2019s literally nothing he can do to hurt kakashi either. Hashirama is probably only strong enough to beat alive madara without rinnegan (definitely not storng enough to beat juubi madara).

Boro was stated to be just as, if not stronger, than Delta. Delta is the person who managed to give Adult KCM2 Naruto a tough ass time (and I know he couldn\u2019t go all out but still.) Adult KCM2 Naruto scales far above any kage in existence including Hashirama. So that means Delta is also stronger than him since she managed to hurt and react to Naruto, who again is leagues above Hashirama. So by statements, Boro is near her level making him stronger than Hashirama. And Borushiki absolutely annihilated him with a rasengan. Logical scaling: Borushiki is on the same level as Boro and Delta, who are above Hashirama",

She was just having too much power. And there is nothing much which shows that Kakashi was fast enough with kaguya. Now hear my points. Kakashi was fast, but not as fast as tobirama right? Yet when tobirama was attacking madara, madara dodged it. And you know that madara wasn't even in his rebirth form I think, and hashirama had been going on to fight with madara forever. So we can say that his speed is more / on par with that of madara. And in raw power Kakashi posesses a lot of jutsu, kamui and susanoo right? But hashirama can counter nirmal jutsus, can fight through kamui, and susanoo is something he has been fighting to madara with. So it's good enough I reckon",

This is the same Naruto that dodged a beam of light point blank. All of them are now the top 3 fastest people in the Narutoverse. And Kakashi managed to blitz her. Making him the fastest character in the entire universe (excluding Borutoverse). Madara had to suck up the God tree, be the ten tails jinchuriki and have the rinnesharigan for Hagoromo to say \u201coh he\u2019s getting close to my moms power\u201d meaning he wasn\u2019t even on Kaguya\u2019s level yet. And Kakashi BLITZED HER. There\u2019s nothing to argue. Unless you can prove that EMS Madara is faster than SO6P Naruto, Rinnegan Sasuke and Kaguya, then I\u2019ve won here. Btw, they\u2019re all relativistic in speed so good luck scaling Madara. Dude is at best lightning speed and even I doubt he\u2019s that fast in EMS",

Because edo was brought back at 80% while Alive Tobirama is 100% since he\u2019s himself. \nAnother example is the exchange between Kabuto and Madara, Kabuto states he brought him near \u201chis glory days\u201d form. Where Madara says Kabuto knows nothing of his glory days. \n\nSecond of all, edo Madara- with the rinnegan- stalemated edo Hashirama. While when they were alive, there was a victor.  And no, it\u2019s not because EMS Madara was weaker during VoTE. As I previously said, no edo is brought back at full strength. So,by simple logic, EMS Madara is stronger than his edo self.\nRinne rebirth Madara had to absorb Hashirama\u2019s sage mode, for Hashirama to say \u201che\u2019s gaining his past strength\u201d. And this was after the edo fight between both of them. Meaning even he realized that they weren\u2019t at their peak \n\nIf you aren\u2019t at 100% if your capabilities, then you aren\u2019t as fast nor as strong as you are at 80-90%",

[She already proves this by reacting to Amenjotejikara + Chidori point blank, the usage of exclamation marks is to show that she's perceived him](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/vsbattles/images/1/13/Naruto-5082851.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170406204459). She is incredibly fast.\n\nIn the scan I linked originally, she has a six paths enhanced byakugan(reason I say enhanced and not ordinary is because it's stated six paths chakra enhances ocular powers) active with 360 degree vision, she actually reacts to, and perceives Sakura. This is denoted by the \"!\": her durability is therefore not affected as she's not struck while \"off guard\" by Sakura because she knew Sakura was above about to strike.\n\n>is konohamaru a god because he defeated a pain by surprise?\n\nOne path of pain is fodder in the grand scheme of things. (Unless Tendo)",

                                    "body": ">*Naruto definitely blitzed kaguya pretty easily*\n\nYeah he did, but he also got blitzed by Kaguya at points during the fight. Zetsu stated Kaguya was getting exponentially stronger by the moment so it is tricky to work out how strong Kaguya is relative to Naruto/Sasuke at various points during the fight, or that Naruto/Sasuke even scale to her in speed after a certain point. For the sake of simplicity and clarity I'd probably say throughout the fight Kaguya was \\~ to Naruto/Sasuke as a pair.\n\n>*sakura isnt even strongest kunoichi*\n\nThis is right, Kurotsuchi is as of the Momoshiki fight. Sakura was not considered when Shikamaru stated that the warriors sent to retrieve Naruto were the strongest available. This could potentially be debunked via Shin scaling however & drawing into question whether Shikamaru knows how strong Sakura currently is since she's pretty much not fighting anymore & Kurotsuchi is a kage.\n\n>*speed of punch*\n\nNot true, the chidori draws out the users maximum speed to the point of tunnel vision, hence why it's only feasible with the sharingan. [Chidori is in effect a temporary speed amp](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11134/111341899/7360382-2889434371-0114-.png).\n\n[Source 1](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EROnMhPXkAMvb3b.jpg) on it's feasibility, [Source 2](https://imgur.com/8VJkYd4) on it's speed, [Source 3, speed of the thrust itself being insane](https://imgur.com/Xo6VrSl).\n\n>*wood style drains chakra*\n\nThese abilities are irrelevant when taking into account Sakura's sheer speed displayed in the Kaguya feat. She is faster than Hashirama is, and via the SPSM Shadow Clone scaling arguably just outright has higher AP(maybe a weaker argument than the others I proposed). There's an alternate means of scaling her to be faster than Hashirama via her being \\~ to KCM2(or even really KCM1, same result). In short, she would have to be caught in the wood dragon which is very unlikely.\n\n>*hinata will win because she block chakra*\n\nShe gets blitzed before even landing a single hit. Her speed feats in the WA are subpar compared to Sakura.\n\nSakura isn't going to totally stomp/one shot, she has a decent shot at beating Hashirama is what i'm saying\n\nEdit:\n\nOn another note, having someone not just say sakuratard/idiot and actually want to discuss this is nice & unexpected, thank you. Pretty cool discussion",

But if Hashirama gets trapped in that huge ass water bubble what\u2019s he gonna do? Just hold his breath the whole fight??? I don\u2019t think Hashirama has experience fighting someone as proficient with Water Release as Kisame. And that is the bulk of the point I\u2019m making. Also, it only take a few exchanges with samehada for Kisame to have taken some of Hashirama\u2019s chakra. Maybe he can\u2019t use it because Hashirama\u2019s life force/chakra is hard to control. But that does mean it is being taken from him. And once Kisame and samehada fuse Kisame can take chakra with his body in addition to his water shark jutsu. I think hashirama wins. Neither one of us has even considered senjutsu because that\u2019s clearly an easy win. But I think Kisame can definitely last some rounds. And may even put hashirama in a predicament if he assumes Kisame is fodder. \n\nOkay okay fuck that final villain shit. There\u2019s an exponential jump between 7 gates and 8 gates. We saw 8 gates guy obliterate jubi-Madara. Yes I know Madara regens and guy should die. However, if guy woke up one morning and had breakfast, then immediately went somewhere to fight hashirama i think 7 Gates would also put mad pressure on hashirama. He\u2019s still human, so if guy when 7 Gates and went full tilt hashirama is definitely fighting. Like no one beneath this level of combat is worth a fight to hashirama. I think it\u2019s silly to think that 7 gates guy ISN\u2019T TOUCHING Hashirama. What about guy fighting the reanimated jinjuriki and obito with bee, Naruto, and Kakashi? Clearly guy is in a league of his own with 7 gates. If he attacks non stop he\u2019s definitely pressuring Hashirama.",

Hashirama is a veteran who has faced foes far deadlier than kisame and gai. The moment kisame / samehada try to take in hashirama's  chakra it's a wrap. They will die by themselves before hashirama gets a chance to start fighting. \n\nHashirama getting trapped in that \" huge ass water bubble\" only makes things easier for him. He can create and protude wood style out of nowhere. Kisame is going to die in this bubble.  The wooden golem is so powerful that it changes the world map upon each use. That's the scope of it's destruction. \n\nSenjutsu is not something I forgot. Because Hashirama can beat kisame comfortably without ever needing to use it. The amount of raw chakra hashirama has is more than kisame. Also an expert at sealing jutsus if that was not enough. \n\nThe entirety of ur Gai's argument is moot. Gai is much more of a human than hashirama. Hashirama will simply outlast 7 gates gai since he's most likely inferior to gai when it comes to taijutsu.  It's not a fair fight buddy. \n\n\nEdit : The best water release expert in the history of Shinobi world was Tobirama senju. Hashirama's younger brother. He would mop the floor with kisame using his own jutsus.  There is nothing kisame can do that will surprise hashirama much less concern him. \n\nThe only thing kisame has over hashirama are stronger teeth for biting and chewing food.

Honestly, I give Hashirama the edge because of his healing abilities, and I think it would be a battle of attrition that Hiruzen may not survive because of those abilities. Id love to see how Kishi would weigh in on this. I know a lot of people hang on to power scalers on YT, but I don't think they're the end all, be all of Naruto knowledge. If we depended on power scaling alone, then Naruto wouldn't have survived his earlier battles because he's bested his opponents who were far more superior and experienced than he is during the time of those battles. We often neglect battle experience when vs battles come up.",

I don\u2019t wanna argue but personally I am of the opinion that naruto is stronger than hashirama and due to his near limitless chakra is probably one of the only people that can fight hashirama until his thousand healings jutsu wears off. And naruto would still probably have enough chakra to continue fighting. \n\nMost other people have the ability to land lethal blows, but couldn\u2019t outlast his thousand healings jutsu making their lethal blows useless. I even think fan favorite Itachi falls to the might of Hashirama, because if Genjutsu was all it took to take him down then Madara wouldn\u2019t have had such a tough time.",

                    "body": "His DMS mode lasted only half an episode. Here's how it went: \n\nKakashi uses Susanoo, catches Sakura, uses 1 kamui shuriken attack, uses right eye ability to save himself, Susanoo gone, 1 kamui lightning blade and 1 left eye ability. \n\nAll this lasted only a few minutes and when they returned, he literally collapsed due to sharingan use. So you can't say he had 0 chakra problems. \n\nIf he were to fight Hashirama, Hashirama could just use a huge wooden structure/beast in front of him so he himself could not get hit by kamui shuriken or long range kamui. Thus, no long range win for Kakashi. He needs to get close to Hashirama. His only chance would be to outright run towards Hashirama and right through anything wood lying in their path and aim any close range kamui attack on his head (he can otherwise heal). But Hashirama has enough time to make an indistinguishable wooden clone during this time so Kakashi wouldn't know where real Hashirama is. If the fight lasts any longer, Kakashi cannot sustain using DMS abilities and would definitely lose. \n\nEven if somehow Kakashi manages to teleport Hashirama to his dimension using Kamui, he cannot use his left eye ability again because if he does, he could get hit by Hashirama like Obito got hit by Kakashi. Thus, teleporting alone does not count as a win.",

Meanwhile hashirama as a reanimation with nerfed abilities  pinned down the 10 tails for a while by himself. Let's not sleep on EMS Madara since we all know how strong 9 tails is, and how strong a perfect susano is. By your logic Sakura beats hashirama. Maybe if we super wank Kakashi to have permanent DMS (which would be a stretch.) But idk, I think your just downplaying hashirama a lot.",

All it takes is literally one of any of his kamui moves and hashirama\u2019s done. There\u2019s literally nothing he can do to hurt kakashi either. Hashirama is probably only strong enough to beat alive madara without rinnegan (definitely not storng enough to beat juubi madara).

Boro was stated to be just as, if not stronger, than Delta. Delta is the person who managed to give Adult KCM2 Naruto a tough ass time (and I know he couldn\u2019t go all out but still.) Adult KCM2 Naruto scales far above any kage in existence including Hashirama. So that means Delta is also stronger than him since she managed to hurt and react to Naruto, who again is leagues above Hashirama. So by statements, Boro is near her level making him stronger than Hashirama. And Borushiki absolutely annihilated him with a rasengan. Logical scaling: Borushiki is on the same level as Boro and Delta, who are above Hashirama",

She was just having too much power. And there is nothing much which shows that Kakashi was fast enough with kaguya. Now hear my points. Kakashi was fast, but not as fast as tobirama right? Yet when tobirama was attacking madara, madara dodged it. And you know that madara wasn't even in his rebirth form I think, and hashirama had been going on to fight with madara forever. So we can say that his speed is more / on par with that of madara. And in raw power Kakashi posesses a lot of jutsu, kamui and susanoo right? But hashirama can counter nirmal jutsus, can fight through kamui, and susanoo is something he has been fighting to madara with. So it's good enough I reckon",

Logically he\u2019s faster than the 5 kage and just as fast as Hashirama. But Kaguya blitzed SIX PATHS SAGE MODE AND SIX PATHS SENJUTSU NARUTO ALONG WITH SIX PATHS RINNEGAN SASUKE. This is the same Naruto that dodged a beam of light point blank. All of them are now the top 3 fastest people in the Narutoverse. And Kakashi managed to blitz her. Making him the fastest character in the entire universe (excluding Borutoverse). Madara had to suck up the God tree, be the ten tails jinchuriki and have the rinnesharigan for Hagoromo to say \u201coh he\u2019s getting close to my moms power\u201d meaning he wasn\u2019t even on Kaguya\u2019s level yet. And Kakashi BLITZED HER. There\u2019s nothing to argue. Unless you can prove that EMS Madara is faster than SO6P Naruto, Rinnegan Sasuke and Kaguya, then I\u2019ve won here. Btw, they\u2019re all relativistic in speed so good luck scaling Madara. Dude is at best lightning speed and even I doubt he\u2019s that fast in EMS",

Have you noticed that both Kabuto and Orochimaru have never said \u201cyou\u2019re stronger than when you were alive\u201d ? Because they aren\u2019t. Alive Tobirama wins against Edo Tobirama. Because edo was brought back at 80% while Alive Tobirama is 100% since he\u2019s himself. \nAnother example is the exchange between Kabuto and Madara, Kabuto states he brought him near \u201chis glory days\u201d form. Where Madara says Kabuto knows nothing of his glory days. \n\nSecond of all, edo Madara- with the rinnegan- stalemated edo Hashirama. While when they were alive, there was a victor.  And no, it\u2019s not because EMS Madara was weaker during VoTE. As I previously said, no edo is brought back at full strength. So,by simple logic, EMS Madara is stronger than his edo self.\nRinne rebirth Madara had to absorb Hashirama\u2019s sage mode, for Hashirama to say \u201che\u2019s gaining his past strength\u201d. And this was after the edo fight between both of them. Meaning even he realized that they weren\u2019t at their peak \n\nIf you aren\u2019t at 100% if your capabilities, then you aren\u2019t as fast nor as strong as you are at 80-90%",

[She already proves this by reacting to Amenjotejikara + Chidori point blank, the usage of exclamation marks is to show that she's perceived him](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/vsbattles/images/1/13/Naruto-5082851.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170406204459). She is incredibly fast.\n\nIn the scan I linked originally, she has a six paths enhanced byakugan(reason I say enhanced and not ordinary is because it's stated six paths chakra enhances ocular powers) active with 360 degree vision, she actually reacts to, and perceives Sakura. This is denoted by the \"!\": her durability is therefore not affected as she's not struck while \"off guard\" by Sakura because she knew Sakura was above about to strike.\n\n>is konohamaru a god because he defeated a pain by surprise?\n\nOne path of pain is fodder in the grand scheme of things. (Unless Tendo)",

                            "body": ">*Naruto definitely blitzed kaguya pretty easily*\n\nYeah he did, but he also got blitzed by Kaguya at points during the fight. Zetsu stated Kaguya was getting exponentially stronger by the moment so it is tricky to work out how strong Kaguya is relative to Naruto/Sasuke at various points during the fight, or that Naruto/Sasuke even scale to her in speed after a certain point. For the sake of simplicity and clarity I'd probably say throughout the fight Kaguya was \\~ to Naruto/Sasuke as a pair.\n\n>*sakura isnt even strongest kunoichi*\n\nThis is right, Kurotsuchi is as of the Momoshiki fight. Sakura was not considered when Shikamaru stated that the warriors sent to retrieve Naruto were the strongest available. This could potentially be debunked via Shin scaling however & drawing into question whether Shikamaru knows how strong Sakura currently is since she's pretty much not fighting anymore & Kurotsuchi is a kage.\n\n>*speed of punch*\n\nNot true, the chidori draws out the users maximum speed to the point of tunnel vision, hence why it's only feasible with the sharingan. [Chidori is in effect a temporary speed amp](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11134/111341899/7360382-2889434371-0114-.png).\n\n[Source 1](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EROnMhPXkAMvb3b.jpg) on it's feasibility, [Source 2](https://imgur.com/8VJkYd4) on it's speed, [Source 3, speed of the thrust itself being insane](https://imgur.com/Xo6VrSl).\n\n>*wood style drains chakra*\n\nThese abilities are irrelevant when taking into account Sakura's sheer speed displayed in the Kaguya feat. She is faster than Hashirama is, and via the SPSM Shadow Clone scaling arguably just outright has higher AP(maybe a weaker argument than the others I proposed). There's an alternate means of scaling her to be faster than Hashirama via her being \\~ to KCM2(or even really KCM1, same result). In short, she would have to be caught in the wood dragon which is very unlikely.\n\n>*hinata will win because she block chakra*\n\nShe gets blitzed before even landing a single hit. Her speed feats in the WA are subpar compared to Sakura.\n\nSakura isn't going to totally stomp/one shot, she has a decent shot at beating Hashirama is what i'm saying\n\nEdit:\n\nOn another note, having someone not just say sakuratard/idiot and actually want to discuss this is nice & unexpected, thank you. Pretty cool discussion",

But if Hashirama gets trapped in that huge ass water bubble what\u2019s he gonna do? Just hold his breath the whole fight??? I don\u2019t think Hashirama has experience fighting someone as proficient with Water Release as Kisame. And that is the bulk of the point I\u2019m making. Also, it only take a few exchanges with samehada for Kisame to have taken some of Hashirama\u2019s chakra. Maybe he can\u2019t use it because Hashirama\u2019s life force/chakra is hard to control. But that does mean it is being taken from him. And once Kisame and samehada fuse Kisame can take chakra with his body in addition to his water shark jutsu. I think hashirama wins. Neither one of us has even considered senjutsu because that\u2019s clearly an easy win. But I think Kisame can definitely last some rounds. And may even put hashirama in a predicament if he assumes Kisame is fodder. \n\nOkay okay fuck that final villain shit. There\u2019s an exponential jump between 7 gates and 8 gates. We saw 8 gates guy obliterate jubi-Madara. Yes I know Madara regens and guy should die. However, if guy woke up one morning and had breakfast, then immediately went somewhere to fight hashirama i think 7 Gates would also put mad pressure on hashirama. He\u2019s still human, so if guy when 7 Gates and went full tilt hashirama is definitely fighting. Like no one beneath this level of combat is worth a fight to hashirama. I think it\u2019s silly to think that 7 gates guy ISN\u2019T TOUCHING Hashirama. What about guy fighting the reanimated jinjuriki and obito with bee, Naruto, and Kakashi? Clearly guy is in a league of his own with 7 gates. If he attacks non stop he\u2019s definitely pressuring Hashirama.",

The moment kisame / samehada try to take in hashirama's  chakra it's a wrap. They will die by themselves before hashirama gets a chance to start fighting. \n\nHashirama getting trapped in that \" huge ass water bubble\" only makes things easier for him. He can create and protude wood style out of nowhere. Kisame is going to die in this bubble.  The wooden golem is so powerful that it changes the world map upon each use. That's the scope of it's destruction. \n\nSenjutsu is not something I forgot. Because Hashirama can beat kisame comfortably without ever needing to use it. The amount of raw chakra hashirama has is more than kisame. Also an expert at sealing jutsus if that was not enough. \n\nThe entirety of ur Gai's argument is moot. Gai is much more of a human than hashirama. Hashirama will simply outlast 7 gates gai since he's most likely inferior to gai when it comes to taijutsu.  It's not a fair fight buddy. \n\n\nEdit : The best water release expert in the history of Shinobi world was Tobirama senju. Hashirama's younger brother. He would mop the floor with kisame using his own jutsus.  There is nothing kisame can do that will surprise hashirama much less concern him. \n\nThe only thing kisame has over hashirama are stronger teeth for biting and chewing food. That and maybe a better toned upper body idk.",

I don\u2019t wanna argue but personally I am of the opinion that naruto is stronger than hashirama and due to his near limitless chakra is probably one of the only people that can fight hashirama until his thousand healings jutsu wears off. And naruto would still probably have enough chakra to continue fighting. \n\nMost other people have the ability to land lethal blows, but couldn\u2019t outlast his thousand healings jutsu making their lethal blows useless. I even think fan favorite Itachi falls to the might of Hashirama, because if Genjutsu was all it took to take him down then Madara wouldn\u2019t have had such a tough time.",

If he stays alive after a fight, that is considered a win. I don't want to sound like he's weak, no, he's extremely strong. He defeated Kisame within minutes using 7 gates and stayed alive. That is clearly a win and the fight highlights how strong he is, as he killed someone with chakra rivalling tailed beasts. He's clearly high Kage level. I'd put 7 gates guy beside the sannin and 8 gates guy beside Hashirama, Madara, Sasuke and Naruto, but not beyond that since he also dies in those fights.",

Here's how it went: \n\nKakashi uses Susanoo, catches Sakura, uses 1 kamui shuriken attack, uses right eye ability to save himself, Susanoo gone, 1 kamui lightning blade and 1 left eye ability. \n\nAll this lasted only a few minutes and when they returned, he literally collapsed due to sharingan use. So you can't say he had 0 chakra problems. \n\nIf he were to fight Hashirama, Hashirama could just use a huge wooden structure/beast in front of him so he himself could not get hit by kamui shuriken or long range kamui. Thus, no long range win for Kakashi. He needs to get close to Hashirama. His only chance would be to outright run towards Hashirama and right through anything wood lying in their path and aim any close range kamui attack on his head (he can otherwise heal). But Hashirama has enough time to make an indistinguishable wooden clone during this time so Kakashi wouldn't know where real Hashirama is. If the fight lasts any longer, Kakashi cannot sustain using DMS abilities and would definitely lose. \n\nEven if somehow Kakashi manages to teleport Hashirama to his dimension using Kamui, he cannot use his left eye ability again because if he does, he could get hit by Hashirama like Obito got hit by Kakashi. Thus, teleporting alone does not count as a win.",

All it takes is literally one of any of his kamui moves and hashirama\u2019s done. There\u2019s literally nothing he can do to hurt kakashi either. Hashirama is probably only strong enough to beat alive madara without rinnegan (definitely not storng enough to beat juubi madara).

She was just having too much power. And there is nothing much which shows that Kakashi was fast enough with kaguya. Now hear my points. Kakashi was fast, but not as fast as tobirama right? Yet when tobirama was attacking madara, madara dodged it. And you know that madara wasn't even in his rebirth form I think, and hashirama had been going on to fight with madara forever. So we can say that his speed is more / on par with that of madara. And in raw power Kakashi posesses a lot of jutsu, kamui and susanoo right? But hashirama can counter nirmal jutsus, can fight through kamui, and susanoo is something he has been fighting to madara with. So it's good enough I reckon",

Have you noticed that both Kabuto and Orochimaru have never said \u201cyou\u2019re stronger than when you were alive\u201d ? Because they aren\u2019t. Alive Tobirama wins against Edo Tobirama. Because edo was brought back at 80% while Alive Tobirama is 100% since he\u2019s himself. \nAnother example is the exchange between Kabuto and Madara, Kabuto states he brought him near \u201chis glory days\u201d form. Where Madara says Kabuto knows nothing of his glory days. \n\nSecond of all, edo Madara- with the rinnegan- stalemated edo Hashirama. While when they were alive, there was a victor.  And no, it\u2019s not because EMS Madara was weaker during VoTE. As I previously said, no edo is brought back at full strength. So,by simple logic, EMS Madara is stronger than his edo self.\nRinne rebirth Madara had to absorb Hashirama\u2019s sage mode, for Hashirama to say \u201che\u2019s gaining his past strength\u201d. And this was after the edo fight between both of them. Meaning even he realized that they weren\u2019t at their peak \n\nIf you aren\u2019t at 100% if your capabilities, then you aren\u2019t as fast nor as strong as you are at 80-90%",

[She already proves this by reacting to Amenjotejikara + Chidori point blank, the usage of exclamation marks is to show that she's perceived him](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/vsbattles/images/1/13/Naruto-5082851.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170406204459). She is incredibly fast.\n\nIn the scan I linked originally, she has a six paths enhanced byakugan(reason I say enhanced and not ordinary is because it's stated six paths chakra enhances ocular powers) active with 360 degree vision, she actually reacts to, and perceives Sakura. This is denoted by the \"!\": her durability is therefore not affected as she's not struck while \"off guard\" by Sakura because she knew Sakura was above about to strike.\n\n>is konohamaru a god because he defeated a pain by surprise?\n\nOne path of pain is fodder in the grand scheme of things. (Unless Tendo)",

                    "body": ">*Naruto definitely blitzed kaguya pretty easily*\n\nYeah he did, but he also got blitzed by Kaguya at points during the fight. Zetsu stated Kaguya was getting exponentially stronger by the moment so it is tricky to work out how strong Kaguya is relative to Naruto/Sasuke at various points during the fight, or that Naruto/Sasuke even scale to her in speed after a certain point. For the sake of simplicity and clarity I'd probably say throughout the fight Kaguya was \\~ to Naruto/Sasuke as a pair.\n\n>*sakura isnt even strongest kunoichi*\n\nThis is right, Kurotsuchi is as of the Momoshiki fight. Sakura was not considered when Shikamaru stated that the warriors sent to retrieve Naruto were the strongest available. This could potentially be debunked via Shin scaling however & drawing into question whether Shikamaru knows how strong Sakura currently is since she's pretty much not fighting anymore & Kurotsuchi is a kage.\n\n>*speed of punch*\n\nNot true, the chidori draws out the users maximum speed to the point of tunnel vision, hence why it's only feasible with the sharingan. [Chidori is in effect a temporary speed amp](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11134/111341899/7360382-2889434371-0114-.png).\n\n[Source 1](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EROnMhPXkAMvb3b.jpg) on it's feasibility, [Source 2](https://imgur.com/8VJkYd4) on it's speed, [Source 3, speed of the thrust itself being insane](https://imgur.com/Xo6VrSl).\n\n>*wood style drains chakra*\n\nThese abilities are irrelevant when taking into account Sakura's sheer speed displayed in the Kaguya feat. She is faster than Hashirama is, and via the SPSM Shadow Clone scaling arguably just outright has higher AP(maybe a weaker argument than the others I proposed). There's an alternate means of scaling her to be faster than Hashirama via her being \\~ to KCM2(or even really KCM1, same result). In short, she would have to be caught in the wood dragon which is very unlikely.\n\n>*hinata will win because she block chakra*\n\nShe gets blitzed before even landing a single hit. Her speed feats in the WA are subpar compared to Sakura.\n\nSakura isn't going to totally stomp/one shot, she has a decent shot at beating Hashirama is what i'm saying\n\nEdit:\n\nOn another note, having someone not just say sakuratard/idiot and actually want to discuss this is nice & unexpected, thank you. Pretty cool discussion",

The moment kisame / samehada try to take in hashirama's  chakra it's a wrap. They will die by themselves before hashirama gets a chance to start fighting. \n\nHashirama getting trapped in that \" huge ass water bubble\" only makes things easier for him. He can create and protude wood style out of nowhere. Kisame is going to die in this bubble.  The wooden golem is so powerful that it changes the world map upon each use. That's the scope of it's destruction. \n\nSenjutsu is not something I forgot. Because Hashirama can beat kisame comfortably without ever needing to use it. The amount of raw chakra hashirama has is more than kisame. Also an expert at sealing jutsus if that was not enough. \n\nThe entirety of ur Gai's argument is moot. Gai is much more of a human than hashirama. Hashirama will simply outlast 7 gates gai since he's most likely inferior to gai when it comes to taijutsu.  It's not a fair fight buddy. \n\n\nEdit : The best water release expert in the history of Shinobi world was Tobirama senju. Hashirama's younger brother. He would mop the floor with kisame using his own jutsus.  There is nothing kisame can do that will surprise hashirama much less concern him. \n\nThe only thing kisame has over hashirama are stronger teeth for biting and chewing food. That and maybe a better toned upper body idk.",

I don\u2019t wanna argue but personally I am of the opinion that naruto is stronger than hashirama and due to his near limitless chakra is probably one of the only people that can fight hashirama until his thousand healings jutsu wears off. And naruto would still probably have enough chakra to continue fighting. \n\nMost other people have the ability to land lethal blows, but couldn\u2019t outlast his thousand healings jutsu making their lethal blows useless. I even think fan favorite Itachi falls to the might of Hashirama, because if Genjutsu was all it took to take him down then Madara wouldn\u2019t have had such a tough time.",

Logically he\u2019s faster than the 5 kage and just as fast as Hashirama. But Kaguya blitzed SIX PATHS SAGE MODE AND SIX PATHS SENJUTSU NARUTO ALONG WITH SIX PATHS RINNEGAN SASUKE. This is the same Naruto that dodged a beam of light point blank. All of them are now the top 3 fastest people in the Narutoverse. And Kakashi managed to blitz her. Making him the fastest character in the entire universe (excluding Borutoverse). Madara had to suck up the God tree, be the ten tails jinchuriki and have the rinnesharigan for Hagoromo to say \u201coh he\u2019s getting close to my moms power\u201d meaning he wasn\u2019t even on Kaguya\u2019s level yet. And Kakashi BLITZED HER. There\u2019s nothing to argue. Unless you can prove that EMS Madara is faster than SO6P Naruto, Rinnegan Sasuke and Kaguya, then I\u2019ve won here. Btw, they\u2019re all relativistic in speed so good luck scaling Madara. Dude is at best lightning speed and even I doubt he\u2019s that fast in EMS",

Have you noticed that both Kabuto and Orochimaru have never said \u201cyou\u2019re stronger than when you were alive\u201d ? Because they aren\u2019t. Alive Tobirama wins against Edo Tobirama. Because edo was brought back at 80% while Alive Tobirama is 100% since he\u2019s himself. \nAnother example is the exchange between Kabuto and Madara, Kabuto states he brought him near \u201chis glory days\u201d form. Where Madara says Kabuto knows nothing of his glory days. \n\nSecond of all, edo Madara- with the rinnegan- stalemated edo Hashirama. While when they were alive, there was a victor.  And no, it\u2019s not because EMS Madara was weaker during VoTE. As I previously said, no edo is brought back at full strength. So,by simple logic, EMS Madara is stronger than his edo self.\nRinne rebirth Madara had to absorb Hashirama\u2019s sage mode, for Hashirama to say \u201che\u2019s gaining his past strength\u201d. And this was after the edo fight between both of them. Meaning even he realized that they weren\u2019t at their peak \n\nIf you aren\u2019t at 100% if your capabilities, then you aren\u2019t as fast nor as strong as you are at 80-90%",

            "body": ">*Naruto definitely blitzed kaguya pretty easily*\n\nYeah he did, but he also got blitzed by Kaguya at points during the fight. Zetsu stated Kaguya was getting exponentially stronger by the moment so it is tricky to work out how strong Kaguya is relative to Naruto/Sasuke at various points during the fight, or that Naruto/Sasuke even scale to her in speed after a certain point. For the sake of simplicity and clarity I'd probably say throughout the fight Kaguya was \\~ to Naruto/Sasuke as a pair.\n\n>*sakura isnt even strongest kunoichi*\n\nThis is right, Kurotsuchi is as of the Momoshiki fight. Sakura was not considered when Shikamaru stated that the warriors sent to retrieve Naruto were the strongest available. This could potentially be debunked via Shin scaling however & drawing into question whether Shikamaru knows how strong Sakura currently is since she's pretty much not fighting anymore & Kurotsuchi is a kage.\n\n>*speed of punch*\n\nNot true, the chidori draws out the users maximum speed to the point of tunnel vision, hence why it's only feasible with the sharingan. [Chidori is in effect a temporary speed amp](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11134/111341899/7360382-2889434371-0114-.png).\n\n[Source 1](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EROnMhPXkAMvb3b.jpg) on it's feasibility, [Source 2](https://imgur.com/8VJkYd4) on it's speed, [Source 3, speed of the thrust itself being insane](https://imgur.com/Xo6VrSl).\n\n>*wood style drains chakra*\n\nThese abilities are irrelevant when taking into account Sakura's sheer speed displayed in the Kaguya feat. She is faster than Hashirama is, and via the SPSM Shadow Clone scaling arguably just outright has higher AP(maybe a weaker argument than the others I proposed). There's an alternate means of scaling her to be faster than Hashirama via her being \\~ to KCM2(or even really KCM1, same result). In short, she would have to be caught in the wood dragon which is very unlikely.\n\n>*hinata will win because she block chakra*\n\nShe gets blitzed before even landing a single hit. Her speed feats in the WA are subpar compared to Sakura.\n\nSakura isn't going to totally stomp/one shot, she has a decent shot at beating Hashirama is what i'm saying\n\nEdit:\n\nOn another note, having someone not just say sakuratard/idiot and actually want to discuss this is nice & unexpected, thank you. Pretty cool discussion",

All it takes is literally one of any of his kamui moves and hashirama\u2019s done. There\u2019s literally nothing he can do to hurt kakashi either. Hashirama is probably only strong enough to beat alive madara without rinnegan (definitely not storng enough to beat juubi madara).

Logically he\u2019s faster than the 5 kage and just as fast as Hashirama. But Kaguya blitzed SIX PATHS SAGE MODE AND SIX PATHS SENJUTSU NARUTO ALONG WITH SIX PATHS RINNEGAN SASUKE. This is the same Naruto that dodged a beam of light point blank. All of them are now the top 3 fastest people in the Narutoverse. And Kakashi managed to blitz her. Making him the fastest character in the entire universe (excluding Borutoverse). Madara had to suck up the God tree, be the ten tails jinchuriki and have the rinnesharigan for Hagoromo to say \u201coh he\u2019s getting close to my moms power\u201d meaning he wasn\u2019t even on Kaguya\u2019s level yet. And Kakashi BLITZED HER. There\u2019s nothing to argue. Unless you can prove that EMS Madara is faster than SO6P Naruto, Rinnegan Sasuke and Kaguya, then I\u2019ve won here. Btw, they\u2019re all relativistic in speed so good luck scaling Madara. Dude is at best lightning speed and even I doubt he\u2019s that fast in EMS",

There\u2019s literally nothing he can do to hurt kakashi either. Hashirama is probably only strong enough to beat alive madara without rinnegan (definitely not storng enough to beat juubi madara). Dms kakashi blitzed kaguya, who\u2019s obviously a lot stronger (and could have killed her then too but didn\u2019t because he\u2019s not the main character). Its a complete mismatch.",

This is the same Naruto that dodged a beam of light point blank. All of them are now the top 3 fastest people in the Narutoverse. And Kakashi managed to blitz her. Making him the fastest character in the entire universe (excluding Borutoverse). Madara had to suck up the God tree, be the ten tails jinchuriki and have the rinnesharigan for Hagoromo to say \u201coh he\u2019s getting close to my moms power\u201d meaning he wasn\u2019t even on Kaguya\u2019s level yet. And Kakashi BLITZED HER. There\u2019s nothing to argue. Unless you can prove that EMS Madara is faster than SO6P Naruto, Rinnegan Sasuke and Kaguya, then I\u2019ve won here. Btw, they\u2019re all relativistic in speed so good luck scaling Madara. Dude is at best lightning speed and even I doubt he\u2019s that fast in EMS",

Logically he\u2019s faster than the 5 kage and just as fast as Hashirama. But Kaguya blitzed SIX PATHS SAGE MODE AND SIX PATHS SENJUTSU NARUTO ALONG WITH SIX PATHS RINNEGAN SASUKE. This is the same Naruto that dodged a beam of light point blank. All of them are now the top 3 fastest people in the Narutoverse. And Kakashi managed to blitz her. Making him the fastest character in the entire universe (excluding Borutoverse). Madara had to suck up the God tree, be the ten tails jinchuriki and have the rinnesharigan for Hagoromo to say \u201coh he\u2019s getting close to my moms power\u201d meaning he wasn\u2019t even on Kaguya\u2019s level yet. And Kakashi BLITZED HER. There\u2019s nothing to argue. Unless you can prove that EMS Madara is faster than SO6P Naruto, Rinnegan Sasuke and Kaguya, then I\u2019ve won here. Btw, they\u2019re all relativistic in speed so good luck scaling Madara. Dude is at best lightning speed and even I doubt he\u2019s that fast in EMS",

All of them are now the top 3 fastest people in the Narutoverse. And Kakashi managed to blitz her. Making him the fastest character in the entire universe (excluding Borutoverse). Madara had to suck up the God tree, be the ten tails jinchuriki and have the rinnesharigan for Hagoromo to say \u201coh he\u2019s getting close to my moms power\u201d meaning he wasn\u2019t even on Kaguya\u2019s level yet. And Kakashi BLITZED HER. There\u2019s nothing to argue. Unless you can prove that EMS Madara is faster than SO6P Naruto, Rinnegan Sasuke and Kaguya, then I\u2019ve won here. Btw, they\u2019re all relativistic in speed so good luck scaling Madara. Dude is at best lightning speed and even I doubt he\u2019s that fast in EMS",

But Kaguya blitzed SIX PATHS SAGE MODE AND SIX PATHS SENJUTSU NARUTO ALONG WITH SIX PATHS RINNEGAN SASUKE. This is the same Naruto that dodged a beam of light point blank. All of them are now the top 3 fastest people in the Narutoverse. And Kakashi managed to blitz her. Making him the fastest character in the entire universe (excluding Borutoverse). Madara had to suck up the God tree, be the ten tails jinchuriki and have the rinnesharigan for Hagoromo to say \u201coh he\u2019s getting close to my moms power\u201d meaning he wasn\u2019t even on Kaguya\u2019s level yet. And Kakashi BLITZED HER. There\u2019s nothing to argue. Unless you can prove that EMS Madara is faster than SO6P Naruto, Rinnegan Sasuke and Kaguya, then I\u2019ve won here. Btw, they\u2019re all relativistic in speed so good luck scaling Madara. Dude is at best lightning speed and even I doubt he\u2019s that fast in EMS",

Madara had to suck up the God tree, be the ten tails jinchuriki and have the rinnesharigan for Hagoromo to say \u201coh he\u2019s getting close to my moms power\u201d meaning he wasn\u2019t even on Kaguya\u2019s level yet. And Kakashi BLITZED HER. There\u2019s nothing to argue. Unless you can prove that EMS Madara is faster than SO6P Naruto, Rinnegan Sasuke and Kaguya, then I\u2019ve won here. Btw, they\u2019re all relativistic in speed so good luck scaling Madara. Dude is at best lightning speed and even I doubt he\u2019s that fast in EMS",

All of them are now the top 3 fastest people in the Narutoverse. And Kakashi managed to blitz her. Making him the fastest character in the entire universe (excluding Borutoverse). Madara had to suck up the God tree, be the ten tails jinchuriki and have the rinnesharigan for Hagoromo to say \u201coh he\u2019s getting close to my moms power\u201d meaning he wasn\u2019t even on Kaguya\u2019s level yet. And Kakashi BLITZED HER. There\u2019s nothing to argue. Unless you can prove that EMS Madara is faster than SO6P Naruto, Rinnegan Sasuke and Kaguya, then I\u2019ve won here. Btw, they\u2019re all relativistic in speed so good luck scaling Madara. Dude is at best lightning speed and even I doubt he\u2019s that fast in EMS",

All of them are now the top 3 fastest people in the Narutoverse. And Kakashi managed to blitz her. Making him the fastest character in the entire universe (excluding Borutoverse). Madara had to suck up the God tree, be the ten tails jinchuriki and have the rinnesharigan for Hagoromo to say \u201coh he\u2019s getting close to my moms power\u201d meaning he wasn\u2019t even on Kaguya\u2019s level yet.

But Kaguya blitzed SIX PATHS SAGE MODE AND SIX PATHS SENJUTSU NARUTO ALONG WITH SIX PATHS RINNEGAN SASUKE. This is the same Naruto that dodged a beam of light point blank. All of them are now the top 3 fastest people in the Narutoverse. And Kakashi managed to blitz her. Making him the fastest character in the entire universe (excluding Borutoverse). Madara had to suck up the God tree, be the ten tails jinchuriki and have the rinnesharigan for Hagoromo to say \u201coh he\u2019s getting close to my moms power\u201d meaning he wasn\u2019t even on Kaguya\u2019s level yet. And Kakashi BLITZED HER. There\u2019s nothing to argue. Unless you can prove that EMS Madara is faster than SO6P Naruto, Rinnegan Sasuke and Kaguya, then I\u2019ve won here. Btw, they\u2019re all relativistic in speed so good luck scaling Madara. Dude is at best lightning speed and even I doubt he\u2019s that fast in EMS",
