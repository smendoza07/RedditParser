    "body": "She messaged me first about 3 months ago and her ask was 1.5x the highest I've given, but decided to carpe diem YOLO it. We've had exactly 10 intimate dates in 2 months, where 3 of those dates were full Friday to Monday weekends, which makes me feel pretty confident to say without being delusional that she genuinely liked me. After a month, she even started to not bother putting on makeup and those guady nails, and I started to feel like maybe maybe maybe we could move to allowance, but there has always been a nagging undertone of entitlement when we went out on dates.\n\nThe final straw was surprisingly over an e-bike! She's sporty like me and wanted one like mine to get to work more green, get some exercise, and use the pedal assist to not arrive sweaty. Battery tech is evolving rapidly right now, so I did some research on current models and offered to buy her one that I thought she would love because it had styling/colours that appealed more to women with great specs, it would have cost around a dozen ones with double zeros. Well, she did her own research and wanted me to get her one that was more than twice as expensive.\n\nI said \"Doesn't it give you pause that I can afford to be an SD that meets your standards, but the e-bike I bought for myself is still less than what I want to get for you? I would never think of getting the one you want for myself. How do you think I got to this financial position in life?\"\n\nShe went full on Veruca Salt.\n\nI mean, come on. She's told me it takes her 3 to 4 months to find an SD because of her standards, she has a dead end job with no advancement, lives paycheck to paycheck, spends on luxury brand nonsense, and her profile said she also wanted mentorship to raise her standard of living.\n\nShe's blowing up my phone today with a mix anger, sadness, and questionable regret.\n\nNot really looking for advice, just saying: it was worth it, for 2 months.

I've definitely seen plenty in the $2-3k range and even one at almost $8k. \n\nHowever I'd argue it's probably a good choice for a first e-bike like this situation. She wanted it to get to and from work, and the main reason was to not be sweaty when she arrived. There's no need for all the best specs, newest features, etc. Also there's no telling how long this \"urge\" will last before she gets over it or just finds it too inconvenient and moves on leaving the bike to sit unused.\n\nThat's besides the entire point that the e-bike that he's currently using cost less than $1200.",

There are women out there that go through life with the attitude that just because they want something then that means they deserve it.

They just expect the world to give it to them because they are pretty.\n\nI know what I offer for PPM is good for my area and every time I have agreed to see someone that wanted more I have been disappointed.  It seems to me that how they react to what I offer is a good way to gauge how they will be in a relationship.\n\nAn entitled woman will treat you like a pet wallet and get angry when you don't perform for her.

Both of us consider what the other has to offer a fair exchange.\n\nThe problem with entitled sugar babies is that they expect far more in return than they have to offer. It starts with asking for an unreasonably high allowance.  Then demands for extra's and gifts.  And as OP discovered they get pissy when you don't give it to them.  They also are the type to start flaking as soon as you put them on allowance. Best to just next them right away.",

It\u2019s not like you were suddenly surprised by how the person in front of you was.\n\nSo maybe to her, it became unacceptable that you didn\u2019t get her the bike.

And I committed to her expectations by giving her exactly what she asked for without negotiating. I also took her to fancy places and spent more going out than I usually do, gave her pricey gifts, and the gesture of the bike offer was to keep going with the SR.\n\nBut seeing her being wasteful with what she was getting and not doing things to advance herself through life was less and less attractive, but it was still early, so wasn't that bothered about it enough to end it. The outburst and lack of appreciation yesterday was just too much, I'm not in SRs for that.",

That\u2019s just. . Yuck.\n\nI will assume she is young, due to her reactions and she really wanted this bike gift. You could have indulged her. Have you not bought her any gifts before this?\n\nTaking 3-4 months to find someone is not really that long. It can take much longer for most. And I am not talking about meeting anyone online either but more organically. What is this hurry, anyway? Who cares if it take 6 months? If she is not running on scarcity mindset then she is confident enough to know she can and will find someone else. Slow and steady wins the race, as they say.  \n\nUnless, she is operating from a different mindset or has a business model where you want a set amount per month with several patrons. Nothing wrong with that model either but it sounded like she was happy with just one guy or two . .\n\n>I said \"Doesn't it give you pause that I can afford to be an SD that meets your standards, but the e-bike I bought for myself is still less than what I want to get for you? I would never think of getting the one you want for myself. How do you think I got to this financial position in life?\"\n\nThis is talking down to her and outright telling her you value gifts to yourself over gifts to her. maybe, do not outright tell this to someone? It will not go over well with any woman. I know you wrote you were willing to get her one more expensive than yours but your overall message does not say this IMO.\n\nI\u2019m not saying she handled it maturely or whatnot. You can let someone know you are displeased by not responding in anger. I usually choose silence. It gets the message across quite well. \n\nThere is absolutely nothing wrong with knowing your worth btw. But I don\u2019t think it has much to do with what your were giving her monetarily or her looks \u2018scale ranking\u2019 you gave her. \n\nSome maybes here: Maybe, you could have assisted her with finding a better career if you wanted to really mentor her. Perhaps, you could accept that some ladies prefer not to work much or at all, as a kept woman.

I saw two sides to this story. \n\nDifferent kind of bikes here but maybe same feelings. .I used to be very into spinning and mountain biking and I feel like, a bike is a very personal thing. A suitor bought me a peloton when they first came out and I asked him to return it and I picked out something else bc I felt the original peloton bike was made cheaply IMO. But the new spin bike I got was less expensive but better made in quality. Of course, the extra technology added to it separately might have ended up costing more. He didn\u2019t keep track. He also offered to get me a mountain bike bc I was interested in starting that up again but told him I would need to pick that out also. Personally, I don\u2019t feel a bike is the same as requesting your run if the mill tech gadget. You need to feel the bike on your body and it can be a very personal choice. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nShould a woman stay with someone for 1-4 months until she finds someone else?

I don't want to lie and say that all she did was visit the website, sort the bikes by price from high to low, and picked the top result; because I didn't ask her how she picked it, but I'm pretty sure that's all she did. I did ask her why she wanted that model and all I got was \"It's the best\" and \"I want it\". Her choice was not a personal decision.\n\nThere are lots of digs at me in your comments that she isn't losing much, but at the end of the day: she picked me, I was good enough to end her 4 month search with me, she clearly enjoyed my company, I gave her everything she asked for and more for 2 months, I wanted to continue giving to her, but that's not going to happen anymore. You've also fabricated that I treat people like they are disposable to add unwarranted credibility, but it just isn't the case.\n\nShe's not a bad person, but she is too entitled. Full.

I grew up poor, it pains me to see someone live paycheck to paycheck, especially when they can choose not to. I tried to talk about her work and spending decisions without sounding judgemental or controlling. She has so much potential, I want her to do so much more with her life, but she doesn't want that. You can't go into a relationship thinking you can change the person to be what you want them to be. The SR with her, knowing we are not in it for life, was almost perfect. She's gorgeous, a nice person, and I can roll with the demands and the most expensive wine at a restaurant, I can roll with and manage a demand for a much more expensive bike, but I can't roll with Veruca Salt. I know that the more I'm with her, the more I will see that side of her. I know her well enough now to know how steep the climb will be to enlightenment, and I don't want to sign up for that.",

You are desperate to be loved for you and yet the $ part is always in the back of your mind.

My mom cleaned hotel rooms and my dad was a high school janitor.

They'd also be familiar with local laws/requirements/regulations to avoid pitfalls because of stupid lawmakers. \n\nThen go home do your own research based off that. If the local shop wasn't recommending crap or trying to rip you off, try and support local businesses.\n\nThere's also subreddits like r/ebikes that would be helpful with pretty pictures, suggestions and helpful links.",

Both of us consider what the other has to offer a fair exchange.\n\nThe problem with entitled sugar babies is that they expect far more in return than they have to offer. It starts with asking for an unreasonably high allowance.  Then demands for extra's and gifts.  And as OP discovered they get pissy when you don't give it to them.  They also are the type to start flaking as soon as you put them on allowance. Best to just next them right away.",

I saw two sides to this story. \n\nDifferent kind of bikes here but maybe same feelings. .I used to be very into spinning and mountain biking and I feel like, a bike is a very personal thing. A suitor bought me a peloton when they first came out and I asked him to return it and I picked out something else bc I felt the original peloton bike was made cheaply IMO. But the new spin bike I got was less expensive but better made in quality. Of course, the extra technology added to it separately might have ended up costing more. He didn\u2019t keep track. He also offered to get me a mountain bike bc I was interested in starting that up again but told him I would need to pick that out also. Personally, I don\u2019t feel a bike is the same as requesting your run if the mill tech gadget. You need to feel the bike on your body and it can be a very personal choice. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nShould a woman stay with someone for 1-4 months until she finds someone else? Maybe so, if it is not a bad relationship . .with a guy who does not keep saying he can replace her easily as if she is an easily replaceable commodity. but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s missing out on much or operating on scarcity mindset so she isn\u2019t too pressed about losing him. \n\nLike I said, not all money is good money.

She didn't even want to listen to the merits of the model I suggested. I went to a local bike shop, asked questions, and took pictures of the bike and spec sheet to show her. I don't want to lie and say that all she did was visit the website, sort the bikes by price from high to low, and picked the top result; because I didn't ask her how she picked it, but I'm pretty sure that's all she did. I did ask her why she wanted that model and all I got was \"It's the best\" and \"I want it\". Her choice was not a personal decision.\n\nThere are lots of digs at me in your comments that she isn't losing much, but at the end of the day: she picked me, I was good enough to end her 4 month search with me, she clearly enjoyed my company, I gave her everything she asked for and more for 2 months, I wanted to continue giving to her, but that's not going to happen anymore. You've also fabricated that I treat people like they are disposable to add unwarranted credibility, but it just isn't the case.\n\nShe's not a bad person, but she is too entitled. Full.

If you heard our conversation before that quote, including before yesterday, I'm sure you would agree that I did exactly what you are saying. I grew up poor, it pains me to see someone live paycheck to paycheck, especially when they can choose not to. I tried to talk about her work and spending decisions without sounding judgemental or controlling. She has so much potential, I want her to do so much more with her life, but she doesn't want that. You can't go into a relationship thinking you can change the person to be what you want them to be. The SR with her, knowing we are not in it for life, was almost perfect. She's gorgeous, a nice person, and I can roll with the demands and the most expensive wine at a restaurant, I can roll with and manage a demand for a much more expensive bike, but I can't roll with Veruca Salt. I know that the more I'm with her, the more I will see that side of her. I know her well enough now to know how steep the climb will be to enlightenment, and I don't want to sign up for that.",

You're not going to tell your mother you can't help with her meds while sitting on cash. But a 7k handbag isn't fungible. She's going to be able to keep that.\n\nAlso, for SBs, looking nice and fitting in amongst the wealthy are business expenses. She's investing in her career.\n\n There is also the fact that some men don't like giving money but are cool with giving gifts. Some men would much rather gift the handbag for a weekend trip than half the cost in cash paid per night.",

Both of us consider what the other has to offer a fair exchange.\n\nThe problem with entitled sugar babies is that they expect far more in return than they have to offer. It starts with asking for an unreasonably high allowance.  Then demands for extra's and gifts.  And as OP discovered they get pissy when you don't give it to them.  They also are the type to start flaking as soon as you put them on allowance. Best to just next them right away.",

I saw two sides to this story. \n\nDifferent kind of bikes here but maybe same feelings. .I used to be very into spinning and mountain biking and I feel like, a bike is a very personal thing. A suitor bought me a peloton when they first came out and I asked him to return it and I picked out something else bc I felt the original peloton bike was made cheaply IMO. But the new spin bike I got was less expensive but better made in quality. Of course, the extra technology added to it separately might have ended up costing more. He didn\u2019t keep track. He also offered to get me a mountain bike bc I was interested in starting that up again but told him I would need to pick that out also. Personally, I don\u2019t feel a bike is the same as requesting your run if the mill tech gadget. You need to feel the bike on your body and it can be a very personal choice. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nShould a woman stay with someone for 1-4 months until she finds someone else?

I don't want to lie and say that all she did was visit the website, sort the bikes by price from high to low, and picked the top result; because I didn't ask her how she picked it, but I'm pretty sure that's all she did. I did ask her why she wanted that model and all I got was \"It's the best\" and \"I want it\". Her choice was not a personal decision.\n\nThere are lots of digs at me in your comments that she isn't losing much, but at the end of the day: she picked me, I was good enough to end her 4 month search with me, she clearly enjoyed my company, I gave her everything she asked for and more for 2 months, I wanted to continue giving to her, but that's not going to happen anymore. You've also fabricated that I treat people like they are disposable to add unwarranted credibility, but it just isn't the case.\n\nShe's not a bad person, but she is too entitled. Full.

I grew up poor, it pains me to see someone live paycheck to paycheck, especially when they can choose not to. I tried to talk about her work and spending decisions without sounding judgemental or controlling. She has so much potential, I want her to do so much more with her life, but she doesn't want that. You can't go into a relationship thinking you can change the person to be what you want them to be. The SR with her, knowing we are not in it for life, was almost perfect. She's gorgeous, a nice person, and I can roll with the demands and the most expensive wine at a restaurant, I can roll with and manage a demand for a much more expensive bike, but I can't roll with Veruca Salt. I know that the more I'm with her, the more I will see that side of her. I know her well enough now to know how steep the climb will be to enlightenment, and I don't want to sign up for that.",

There's no need for all the best specs, newest features, etc. Also there's no telling how long this \"urge\" will last before she gets over it or just finds it too inconvenient and moves on leaving the bike to sit unused.\n\nThat's besides the entire point that the e-bike that he's currently using cost less than $1200.",

A suitor bought me a peloton when they first came out and I asked him to return it and I picked out something else bc I felt the original peloton bike was made cheaply IMO. But the new spin bike I got was less expensive but better made in quality. Of course, the extra technology added to it separately might have ended up costing more. He didn\u2019t keep track. He also offered to get me a mountain bike bc I was interested in starting that up again but told him I would need to pick that out also.

I don't want to lie and say that all she did was visit the website, sort the bikes by price from high to low, and picked the top result; because I didn't ask her how she picked it, but I'm pretty sure that's all she did. I did ask her why she wanted that model and all I got was \"It's the best\" and \"I want it\". Her choice was not a personal decision.\n\nThere are lots of digs at me in your comments that she isn't losing much, but at the end of the day: she picked me, I was good enough to end her 4 month search with me, she clearly enjoyed my company, I gave her everything she asked for and more for 2 months, I wanted to continue giving to her, but that's not going to happen anymore.

I grew up poor, it pains me to see someone live paycheck to paycheck, especially when they can choose not to. I tried to talk about her work and spending decisions without sounding judgemental or controlling. She has so much potential, I want her to do so much more with her life, but she doesn't want that. You can't go into a relationship thinking you can change the person to be what you want them to be. The SR with her, knowing we are not in it for life, was almost perfect. She's gorgeous, a nice person, and I can roll with the demands and the most expensive wine at a restaurant, I can roll with and manage a demand for a much more expensive bike, but I can't roll with Veruca Salt. I know that the more I'm with her, the more I will see that side of her. I know her well enough now to know how steep the climb will be to enlightenment, and I don't want to sign up for that.",

I saw two sides to this story. \n\nDifferent kind of bikes here but maybe same feelings. .I used to be very into spinning and mountain biking and I feel like, a bike is a very personal thing. A suitor bought me a peloton when they first came out and I asked him to return it and I picked out something else bc I felt the original peloton bike was made cheaply IMO. But the new spin bike I got was less expensive but better made in quality. Of course, the extra technology added to it separately might have ended up costing more. He didn\u2019t keep track. He also offered to get me a mountain bike bc I was interested in starting that up again but told him I would need to pick that out also. Personally, I don\u2019t feel a bike is the same as requesting your run if the mill tech gadget. You need to feel the bike on your body and it can be a very personal choice. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nShould a woman stay with someone for 1-4 months until she finds someone else? Maybe so, if it is not a bad relationship . .with a guy who does not keep saying he can replace her easily as if she is an easily replaceable commodity. but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s missing out on much or operating on scarcity mindset so she isn\u2019t too pressed about losing him. \n\nLike I said, not all money is good money. I never said her reaction was in good taste but his wasn\u2019t exactly innocent.",

You've also fabricated that I treat people like they are disposable to add unwarranted credibility, but it just isn't the case.\n\nShe's not a bad person, but she is too entitled. Full. Stop.\nI do admire the solidarity FWIW.",

I tried to talk about her work and spending decisions without sounding judgemental or controlling. She has so much potential, I want her to do so much more with her life, but she doesn't want that. You can't go into a relationship thinking you can change the person to be what you want them to be. The SR with her, knowing we are not in it for life, was almost perfect. She's gorgeous, a nice person, and I can roll with the demands and the most expensive wine at a restaurant, I can roll with and manage a demand for a much more expensive bike, but I can't roll with Veruca Salt. I know that the more I'm with her, the more I will see that side of her. I know her well enough now to know how steep the climb will be to enlightenment, and I don't want to sign up for that.",
