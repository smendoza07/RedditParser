    "body": "On SA, I get often get messaged by guys who won\u2019t have pictures on their profile or will have their face blurred out (which is perfectly fine with me). But in their intro message, they often feel the need to say \u201cI\u2019m attractive,\u201d \u201cyou won\u2019t be disappointed,\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not ugly.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the type of thing that bothers me like crazy, but it is kind of a turn-off that makes me not take them very seriously or not respond to their intro message altogether. It actually makes me think they\u2019re insecure too. AND, everyone\u2019s idea of what is attractive is different. On the whole, it\u2019s just annoying to read 25% of the time in my inbox \ud83d\ude02. (And I feel like you may be reducing your chances at finding someone on SA if that\u2019s what you\u2019re putting out there.)\n\nAnyone else get really annoyed when they see this? Indifferent? Other reactions?",

I hate my pics but it\u2019s because I rarely like how I take a picture. It never occurred to me to say something like don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m attractive when I message a woman. In fact, when I message with a woman and she wants to see my pics and we\u2019ve had a nice conversation up to that point, when I give her access, I usually say something like, I\u2019ll understand if I\u2019m not your type. Usually one if two things happen. Either I immediately just get blocked. Okay, she didn\u2019t find me attractive. Or she says something along the lines of I\u2019m cute or handsome. Which is always really nice to hear when it comes from a beautiful, lovely woman. \n\nI never understood people who use fake pics or filters when they are planning on meeting the person. I\u2019d rather learn before meeting them whether they would find me attractive and hopefully, since I don\u2019t use any filters, maybe they will find me more attractive than my pics.",
