    "body": "All of my girlfriends who sugar have been complaining about recurrent bacterial vaginitis and they are struggling hard with this. \n\nAfter much research, and suffering with BV myself, I have finally FINALLY discovered the truth. \n\nMen can not have BV, but they can carry Gardnerella, which causes BV. \n\nIf you are also suffering from the horrible stinky BV vagina, and treatment isn\u2019t working, it\u2019s because you are passing it to and receiving it back from all of your partners after treatment. Or from their partners to you. Or from you to them and their partners.\n\n(BV is responsible for the fishy vaginal odor so many of us experience. It is NOT normal and should NOT be ignored)\n\nIf you take enough antibiotics, you can destroy your Flora to the point where your BV becomes CHRONIC. And it will take MONTHS of rebuilding your Flora naturally with probiotics, abstaining from sex, avoiding sugary foods, and intravaginal vitamin c pills to rebuild and strengthen a natural balanced Flora.\n\nPlease please wear condoms! You might not even know you have BV, but trust me. Your partner CAN SMELL IT. If you smell that fishy odor, men and women, it is not normal and it can increase your risk of infection by STDs given it breaks down your protective cell walls. \n\nIt is affecting 1/3 to 1/2 of us women at any given time and more often than not is recurrent, and often becomes chronic. For us in the sugar life, we are exponentially more exposed (men and women) given many of us have multiple sex partners. \n\nLONG STORY SHORT: both partners need treatment! (Yea, that means you too daddy ;) a weeks course of metronidazole pill form should do the trick for men)\n\nStay healthy, stay safe\n\nA fellow redditor\u2019s BV success story for anyone else suffering from chronic BV: please skip to the bottom for her course of treatment that worked wonders for me. (Only after my partner also received treatment)\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/5irc6q/just_want_to_share_my_bv_success_storytldr/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nStudy that investigates treatment of male partners for gardnerella (which causes BV):\n\nhttps://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-020-05563-w\n\n\nAnother highly informative study: \n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7323956/\n\nParticipants \u201cin this study were informed as part of the BV studies that BV was not currently classed as an STI, however, increasing evidence suggests it is associated with sexual activity and that bacteria may be \u201cexchanged between partners\u201d.\n\n\nAdditional research:\n\nhttps://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-016-0161-6\n\n\u201cConclusions\n\nIn monogamous heterosexual couples in which the woman has BV, the significantly higher similarity between the vaginal microbiota and the penile skin and urethral microbiota of the male partner, supports the hypothesis that sexual exchange of BV-associated bacterial taxa is common.\u201d\n\nA bit more for the sceptics:\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21051845/ \n\n\u201cConclusions: Cohesive Gardnerella biofilm is a distinct, clearly definable entity which involves both genders and is sexually transmitted. The correct name distinguishing it from symptom-defined conditions like BV should be gardnerellosis and for the bacterium Gardnerella genitalis.\u201d",

                    "body": "I would get noticeable (to me) BV occasionally (meaning 2 to 3 times a year) because having an IUD can cause many on-again-off-again issues, ranging from weird intermittent spotting, weird lubrication issues, weird feelings, and yes, increased chances of yeast infections and BV. Most commonly it happened to me pretty much within the hour of me sleeping with a new partner, but would clear up by itself without any added boric acid, pro or pre biotics, etc. \n\nI think men forget too often than vaginas are moist, warm, damp, and the insides are dark, which is a fucking orgy for bacteria. Any woman's vagina is a carefully balanced eco-system, some of us are just lucky to have self-balancing or vaginas that aren't sensitive to PH changes. I have several non-SB and non-SW friends who have to carefully scan soap labels to make sure their vaginal PH won't throw a hissy fit if the soap happens to make it's way down there in the shower. And more than a few friends who can only wear certain types of fabric in athletic wear because if they accidentally get lazy and don't shower and change immediately, they run the risk of yeast infections. \n\nShit, half of us get yeast infections just because we had to take antibiotics. \n\nI'd absolutely believe that at any given time 85% of the female population has an *unbalanced* vaginal PH. I would not believe that it is always noticable BV, or that it cannot sort itself out without additional treatments.",

I'm a responsible guy but reading through this and your trash talking of men you clearly have no idea what you're talking about.  It's a bacterial infection that comes from the skin / ph balance so it doesn't matter what you make a man drink or take it will have absolutely no effect.  Unless your treatment sterilizes every inch of a mans skin and magically makes the PH balance between the 2 partners non reactive and compatible then there is no treatment.  Even with condoms this happens sometimes.  Sorry sucks to be a girl?But don't vilify men as though we deny it or you're some kind of victim.  Also you should know what you're talking about before you throw out fictitious solutions (ie \"treatment\") for an infection that men literally can not get.",

She had it and I didn't have gardnerella apparently which I assume is what they tested for.\n\nAlso having multiple partners......which is what SB's do........is risky as you know.  \n\nSo the kind of thinking that is get checked out immediately if somethings up with your partner, even if not an exclusive partner, is scary to you?

Likely due to their own personal shame. Men.

I didn't read anything from a man deny that this exists?  Maybe there were a couple I'm sure.  But you said they are......Then you go on to say it was due to \"shame\" as though men are fully responsible for BV?  If that's not generalizing and talking smack against men I don't know what is?  That's 1 example there are a lot more!!\n\nDiscussing the topic is one thing, but sending a dozen links as though you're a physician and have expertise in this stuff is irresponsible especially online pharmacy links.  Unlike you I don't trust buying pharmaceuticals online, especially when I don't know if anything is wrong  and wouldn't know what to get anyway.  So I go to a real, live, human doctor, get whatever tests based on what the issue may be, and go from there.  You're assertion that I got an STD test when I specifically told them it was related to BV is wrong that's not what they did and you weren't there.  Once again a belligerent assertion you made without having any idea what tests were taken  isn't productive",

I freaking agreed with you that it's an issue 1st thing that was the reason for my post so how am I wrong?  Do I track the science behind BV treatment daily?  No I do not.\n\n Lady I went and got checked out immediately when my partner got BV as a supportive man and at her request, so what did I do wrong?  I would do the same for anyone I'm dating.  I have never stated this isn't an issue so don't try and spin this like I'm a denier or something.  I did miss the funny named gardnerella bacteria but I'm not a Dr. and don't try to fake like I'm one. \n\nWhat exactly are you wanting from men here?  If a man finds out there's an issue with  his girl, you go get checked and treated if necessary.  Period.  Self diagnosing and buying online medicine isn't nearly as safe or thorough as the process I would take.  So if you're trying to convince everyone that men should take the meds you're recommending they buy online without even being diagnosed that's just irresponsible.  \n\nNeither of us are wrong I just disagree with how it should be treated.

We were away together and he said he didn\u2019t care. Turns out I was right so I call him and just say I\u2019m sorry and that my vagina is now healthy and smells delicious again. \nHe responded by laughing and saying oh well I just thought it was normal vagina smell...\n\n\nI also had a girl friend who told me she was upset because her bf didn\u2019t want to go down on her because she smelled and it was causing her insecurities. She said she knew there was nothing wrong because she always showered before he came over. I told her to get checked for BV and she had it and got it treated.\n\nSo the ignorance is real from both sides. Both men and women don\u2019t know enough about BV.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that lots of BV clears on its own and that\u2019s why people don\u2019t know about it.

I wouldn't be rude about it, it would be awkward, but I would tell her. Decades of sexual activity, close woman friends, and a somewhat enlightened attitude would make it clear to me that the priority wasn't protecting her feelings, but rather her health.\n\n>Turns out I was right so I call him and just say I\u2019m sorry and that my vagina is now healthy and smells delicious again. He responded by laughing and saying oh well I just thought it was normal vagina smell...\n\nThat's a good outcome. Having now been \"down there\" enough times with enough different women, I am confident I could tell by smell whether someone is wrong or normal. In a way, that might be the one part of the equation where I'd outdo a typical gynecologist. Unless of course they have become \"sniffers\".\n\n>I also had a girl friend who told me she was upset because her bf didn\u2019t want to go down on her because she smelled and it was causing her insecurities. She said she knew there was nothing wrong because she always showered before he came over. I told her to get checked for BV and she had it and got it treated.\n\nAnd that's definitely a good thing you did. And also why I'm reasonably confident I know the difference between \"a shower might help\" and \"something isn't quite right down there\".\n\n>  \nSo the ignorance is real from both sides. Both men and women don\u2019t know enough about BV.\n\nOne very critical thing I've learned in 5 years in the bowl, is that a lot of the younger women know very little about their bodies (bad education? mediocre or worse parenting?) and sometimes I can teach or direct them to better info. And also, that *I always have more to learn*. So I also thank u/MishHsu for this conversation and thread.",

Most commonly it happened to me pretty much within the hour of me sleeping with a new partner, but would clear up by itself without any added boric acid, pro or pre biotics, etc. \n\nI think men forget too often than vaginas are moist, warm, damp, and the insides are dark, which is a fucking orgy for bacteria. Any woman's vagina is a carefully balanced eco-system, some of us are just lucky to have self-balancing or vaginas that aren't sensitive to PH changes. I have several non-SB and non-SW friends who have to carefully scan soap labels to make sure their vaginal PH won't throw a hissy fit if the soap happens to make it's way down there in the shower. And more than a few friends who can only wear certain types of fabric in athletic wear because if they accidentally get lazy and don't shower and change immediately, they run the risk of yeast infections. \n\nShit, half of us get yeast infections just because we had to take antibiotics. \n\nI'd absolutely believe that at any given time 85% of the female population has an *unbalanced* vaginal PH. I would not believe that it is always noticable BV, or that it cannot sort itself out without additional treatments.",

Unless your treatment sterilizes every inch of a mans skin and magically makes the PH balance between the 2 partners non reactive and compatible then there is no treatment.  Even with condoms this happens sometimes.  Sorry sucks to be a girl?But don't vilify men as though we deny it or you're some kind of victim.

I didn't read anything from a man deny that this exists?  Maybe there were a couple I'm sure.  But you said they are......Then you go on to say it was due to \"shame\" as though men are fully responsible for BV?  If that's not generalizing and talking smack against men I don't know what is?  That's 1 example there are a lot more!!\n\nDiscussing the topic is one thing, but sending a dozen links as though you're a physician and have expertise in this stuff is irresponsible especially online pharmacy links.  Unlike you I don't trust buying pharmaceuticals online, especially when I don't know if anything is wrong  and wouldn't know what to get anyway.  So I go to a real, live, human doctor, get whatever tests based on what the issue may be, and go from there.  You're assertion that I got an STD test when I specifically told them it was related to BV is wrong that's not what they did and you weren't there.  Once again a belligerent assertion you made without having any idea what tests were taken  isn't productive",

I freaking agreed with you that it's an issue 1st thing that was the reason for my post so how am I wrong?  Do I track the science behind BV treatment daily?  No I do not.\n\n Lady I went and got checked out immediately when my partner got BV as a supportive man and at her request, so what did I do wrong?  I would do the same for anyone I'm dating.  I have never stated this isn't an issue so don't try and spin this like I'm a denier or something.  I did miss the funny named gardnerella bacteria but I'm not a Dr. and don't try to fake like I'm one. \n\nWhat exactly are you wanting from men here?  If a man finds out there's an issue with  his girl, you go get checked and treated if necessary.  Period.  Self diagnosing and buying online medicine isn't nearly as safe or thorough as the process I would take.  So if you're trying to convince everyone that men should take the meds you're recommending they buy online without even being diagnosed that's just irresponsible.  \n\nNeither of us are wrong I just disagree with how it should be treated.  You clearly like things black / white or win / lose and I will happily pull down any post that you can prove to me is inaccurate",

Both men and women don\u2019t know enough about BV.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that lots of BV clears on its own and that\u2019s why people don\u2019t know about it.

Decades of sexual activity, close woman friends, and a somewhat enlightened attitude would make it clear to me that the priority wasn't protecting her feelings, but rather her health.\n\n>Turns out I was right so I call him and just say I\u2019m sorry and that my vagina is now healthy and smells delicious again. He responded by laughing and saying oh well I just thought it was normal vagina smell...\n\nThat's a good outcome. Having now been \"down there\" enough times with enough different women, I am confident I could tell by smell whether someone is wrong or normal. In a way, that might be the one part of the equation where I'd outdo a typical gynecologist. Unless of course they have become \"sniffers\".\n\n>I also had a girl friend who told me she was upset because her bf didn\u2019t want to go down on her because she smelled and it was causing her insecurities. She said she knew there was nothing wrong because she always showered before he came over. I told her to get checked for BV and she had it and got it treated.\n\nAnd that's definitely a good thing you did. And also why I'm reasonably confident I know the difference between \"a shower might help\" and \"something isn't quite right down there\".\n\n>  \nSo the ignorance is real from both sides. Both men and women don\u2019t know enough about BV.\n\nOne very critical thing I've learned in 5 years in the bowl, is that a lot of the younger women know very little about their bodies (bad education? mediocre or worse parenting?) and sometimes I can teach or direct them to better info. And also, that *I always have more to learn*. So I also thank u/MishHsu for this conversation and thread.",

Unless your treatment sterilizes every inch of a mans skin and magically makes the PH balance between the 2 partners non reactive and compatible then there is no treatment.  Even with condoms this happens sometimes.  Sorry sucks to be a girl?But don't vilify men as though we deny it or you're some kind of victim.

I didn't read anything from a man deny that this exists?  Maybe there were a couple I'm sure.  But you said they are......Then you go on to say it was due to \"shame\" as though men are fully responsible for BV?  If that's not generalizing and talking smack against men I don't know what is?  That's 1 example there are a lot more!!\n\nDiscussing the topic is one thing, but sending a dozen links as though you're a physician and have expertise in this stuff is irresponsible especially online pharmacy links.  Unlike you I don't trust buying pharmaceuticals online, especially when I don't know if anything is wrong  and wouldn't know what to get anyway.  So I go to a real, live, human doctor, get whatever tests based on what the issue may be, and go from there.  You're assertion that I got an STD test when I specifically told them it was related to BV is wrong that's not what they did and you weren't there.  Once again a belligerent assertion you made without having any idea what tests were taken  isn't productive",

I have never stated this isn't an issue so don't try and spin this like I'm a denier or something.  I did miss the funny named gardnerella bacteria but I'm not a Dr. and don't try to fake like I'm one. \n\nWhat exactly are you wanting from men here?  If a man finds out there's an issue with  his girl, you go get checked and treated if necessary.  Period.  Self diagnosing and buying online medicine isn't nearly as safe or thorough as the process I would take.  So if you're trying to convince everyone that men should take the meds you're recommending they buy online without even being diagnosed that's just irresponsible.  \n\nNeither of us are wrong I just disagree with how it should be treated.

I didn\u2019t talk smack on any men at all, but did express discontent at all of the downvotes given this is a sexual health topic and that men and women should be equally accountable. I thought it would be useful for people in the sugar lifestyle who are sexually active with multiple partners. I didn\u2019t pretend to be a doctor. I posted my personal experience, linked to supporting articles and helpful articles. And many women have chimed in to thank me, as well as some men who expressed curiosity and willingness to learn. \n\nPlease tell me where I\u2019ve gone wrong.\n\nAlso: please don\u2019t forget the comments I made stating that boric acid can be harmful to men. I am not selfishly only concerned with women here but all of us. We are all in this together. And us women are eternally grateful for the generosity of our SD. This however is a health issue and should be addressed",

            "body": ">I\u2019ve had BV multiple times in my life and NEVER have I had a guy say: hmm your vagina smells weird.\n\nI would tell her. I wouldn't be rude about it, it would be awkward, but I would tell her. Decades of sexual activity, close woman friends, and a somewhat enlightened attitude would make it clear to me that the priority wasn't protecting her feelings, but rather her health.\n\n>Turns out I was right so I call him and just say I\u2019m sorry and that my vagina is now healthy and smells delicious again. He responded by laughing and saying oh well I just thought it was normal vagina smell...\n\nThat's a good outcome. Having now been \"down there\" enough times with enough different women, I am confident I could tell by smell whether someone is wrong or normal. In a way, that might be the one part of the equation where I'd outdo a typical gynecologist. Unless of course they have become \"sniffers\".\n\n>I also had a girl friend who told me she was upset because her bf didn\u2019t want to go down on her because she smelled and it was causing her insecurities. She said she knew there was nothing wrong because she always showered before he came over. I told her to get checked for BV and she had it and got it treated.\n\nAnd that's definitely a good thing you did. And also why I'm reasonably confident I know the difference between \"a shower might help\" and \"something isn't quite right down there\".\n\n>  \nSo the ignorance is real from both sides. Both men and women don\u2019t know enough about BV.\n\nOne very critical thing I've learned in 5 years in the bowl, is that a lot of the younger women know very little about their bodies (bad education? mediocre or worse parenting?) and sometimes I can teach or direct them to better info. And also, that *I always have more to learn*. So I also thank u/MishHsu for this conversation and thread.",

I can buy anything from a website but WTF good does that do without a diagnosis so you  know what you have and the exact treatment needed?

I didn't read anything from a man deny that this exists?  Maybe there were a couple I'm sure.  But you said they are......Then you go on to say it was due to \"shame\" as though men are fully responsible for BV?  If that's not generalizing and talking smack against men I don't know what is?  That's 1 example there are a lot more!!\n\nDiscussing the topic is one thing, but sending a dozen links as though you're a physician and have expertise in this stuff is irresponsible especially online pharmacy links.  Unlike you I don't trust buying pharmaceuticals online, especially when I don't know if anything is wrong  and wouldn't know what to get anyway.  So I go to a real, live, human doctor, get whatever tests based on what the issue may be, and go from there.  You're assertion that I got an STD test when I specifically told them it was related to BV is wrong that's not what they did and you weren't there.  Once again a belligerent assertion you made without having any idea what tests were taken  isn't productive",

I have never stated this isn't an issue so don't try and spin this like I'm a denier or something.  I did miss the funny named gardnerella bacteria but I'm not a Dr. and don't try to fake like I'm one. \n\nWhat exactly are you wanting from men here?  If a man finds out there's an issue with  his girl, you go get checked and treated if necessary.  Period.  Self diagnosing and buying online medicine isn't nearly as safe or thorough as the process I would take.  So if you're trying to convince everyone that men should take the meds you're recommending they buy online without even being diagnosed that's just irresponsible.  \n\nNeither of us are wrong I just disagree with how it should be treated.

I didn't read anything from a man deny that this exists?  Maybe there were a couple I'm sure.  But you said they are......Then you go on to say it was due to \"shame\" as though men are fully responsible for BV?  If that's not generalizing and talking smack against men I don't know what is?  That's 1 example there are a lot more!!\n\nDiscussing the topic is one thing, but sending a dozen links as though you're a physician and have expertise in this stuff is irresponsible especially online pharmacy links.  Unlike you I don't trust buying pharmaceuticals online, especially when I don't know if anything is wrong  and wouldn't know what to get anyway.  So I go to a real, live, human doctor, get whatever tests based on what the issue may be, and go from there.  You're assertion that I got an STD test when I specifically told them it was related to BV is wrong that's not what they did and you weren't there.

You're also posting links to medical journals, articles, and shady drug websites for scripts etc.  Oh if you haven't answered yet... You're not a Doctor correct?  I've asked you like 6 times now\n\n Your whole tone and demeanor throughout this thread has been essentially faking being a Doctor, talking smack on men as though we're to blame and you have the solution (which you don't because you're NOT A DOCTOR).  It's laughable.  \n\nI had the balls to engage in this and admit it exists but you're out for blood, being disrespectful to men who chime in with questions or statements, and just being belligerent in general.  \n\nYou're very angry and people on here, including myself, are trying to help........ but you keep fighting the world if you can't tell who's on your side or not.

I thought it would be useful for people in the sugar lifestyle who are sexually active with multiple partners. I didn\u2019t pretend to be a doctor. I posted my personal experience, linked to supporting articles and helpful articles.

I am not selfishly only concerned with women here but all of us. We are all in this together. And us women are eternally grateful for the generosity of our SD.

I didn't read anything from a man deny that this exists?  Maybe there were a couple I'm sure.  But you said they are......Then you go on to say it was due to \"shame\" as though men are fully responsible for BV?  If that's not generalizing and talking smack against men I don't know what is?  That's 1 example there are a lot more!!\n\nDiscussing the topic is one thing, but sending a dozen links as though you're a physician and have expertise in this stuff is irresponsible especially online pharmacy links.  Unlike you I don't trust buying pharmaceuticals online, especially when I don't know if anything is wrong  and wouldn't know what to get anyway.  So I go to a real, live, human doctor, get whatever tests based on what the issue may be, and go from there.  You're assertion that I got an STD test when I specifically told them it was related to BV is wrong that's not what they did and you weren't there.  Once again a belligerent assertion you made without having any idea what tests were taken  isn't productive",

I would do the same for anyone I'm dating.  I have never stated this isn't an issue so don't try and spin this like I'm a denier or something.  I did miss the funny named gardnerella bacteria but I'm not a Dr. and don't try to fake like I'm one. \n\nWhat exactly are you wanting from men here?  If a man finds out there's an issue with  his girl, you go get checked and treated if necessary.  Period.  Self diagnosing and buying online medicine isn't nearly as safe or thorough as the process I would take.  So if you're trying to convince everyone that men should take the meds you're recommending they buy online without even being diagnosed that's just irresponsible.  \n\nNeither of us are wrong I just disagree with how it should be treated.

You weren't there lady,,,,,,,\n\nAnd I followed up at Mayo a few weeks where I always go for another appointment and they got the report from Urgent Care and said I was good.

I didn't read anything from a man deny that this exists?  Maybe there were a couple I'm sure.  But you said they are......Then you go on to say it was due to \"shame\" as though men are fully responsible for BV?  If that's not generalizing and talking smack against men I don't know what is?  That's 1 example there are a lot more!!\n\nDiscussing the topic is one thing, but sending a dozen links as though you're a physician and have expertise in this stuff is irresponsible especially online pharmacy links.  Unlike you I don't trust buying pharmaceuticals online, especially when I don't know if anything is wrong  and wouldn't know what to get anyway.  So I go to a real, live, human doctor, get whatever tests based on what the issue may be, and go from there.  You're assertion that I got an STD test when I specifically told them it was related to BV is wrong that's not what they did and you weren't there.  Once again a belligerent assertion you made without having any idea what tests were taken  isn't productive",

I would do the same for anyone I'm dating.  I have never stated this isn't an issue so don't try and spin this like I'm a denier or something.  I did miss the funny named gardnerella bacteria but I'm not a Dr. and don't try to fake like I'm one. \n\nWhat exactly are you wanting from men here?  If a man finds out there's an issue with  his girl, you go get checked and treated if necessary.  Period.  Self diagnosing and buying online medicine isn't nearly as safe or thorough as the process I would take.  So if you're trying to convince everyone that men should take the meds you're recommending they buy online without even being diagnosed that's just irresponsible.  \n\nNeither of us are wrong I just disagree with how it should be treated.

I didn't read anything from a man deny that this exists?  Maybe there were a couple I'm sure.  But you said they are......Then you go on to say it was due to \"shame\" as though men are fully responsible for BV?  If that's not generalizing and talking smack against men I don't know what is?  That's 1 example there are a lot more!!\n\nDiscussing the topic is one thing, but sending a dozen links as though you're a physician and have expertise in this stuff is irresponsible especially online pharmacy links.  Unlike you I don't trust buying pharmaceuticals online, especially when I don't know if anything is wrong  and wouldn't know what to get anyway.  So I go to a real, live, human doctor, get whatever tests based on what the issue may be, and go from there.  You're assertion that I got an STD test when I specifically told them it was related to BV is wrong that's not what they did and you weren't there.  Once again a belligerent assertion you made without having any idea what tests were taken  isn't productive",

If a man finds out there's an issue with  his girl, you go get checked and treated if necessary.  Period.  Self diagnosing and buying online medicine isn't nearly as safe or thorough as the process I would take.  So if you're trying to convince everyone that men should take the meds you're recommending they buy online without even being diagnosed that's just irresponsible.  \n\nNeither of us are wrong I just disagree with how it should be treated.  You clearly like things black / white or win / lose and I will happily pull down any post that you can prove to me is inaccurate",

You're also posting links to medical journals, articles, and shady drug websites for scripts etc.  Oh if you haven't answered yet... You're not a Doctor correct?  I've asked you like 6 times now\n\n Your whole tone and demeanor throughout this thread has been essentially faking being a Doctor, talking smack on men as though we're to blame and you have the solution (which you don't because you're NOT A DOCTOR).  It's laughable.  \n\nI had the balls to engage in this and admit it exists but you're out for blood, being disrespectful to men who chime in with questions or statements, and just being belligerent in general.  \n\nYou're very angry and people on here, including myself, are trying to help........ but you keep fighting the world if you can't tell who's on your side or not.

I thought it would be useful for people in the sugar lifestyle who are sexually active with multiple partners. I didn\u2019t pretend to be a doctor. I posted my personal experience, linked to supporting articles and helpful articles. And many women have chimed in to thank me, as well as some men who expressed curiosity and willingness to learn. \n\nPlease tell me where I\u2019ve gone wrong.\n\nAlso: please don\u2019t forget the comments I made stating that boric acid can be harmful to men. I am not selfishly only concerned with women here but all of us. We are all in this together. And us women are eternally grateful for the generosity of our SD. This however is a health issue and should be addressed",

Please help us by doing your part!\"\n\nThe above is one of many statements you made and I consider that talking smack on men........not to mention untrue.  I didn't read anything from a man deny that this exists?  Maybe there were a couple I'm sure.  But you said they are......Then you go on to say it was due to \"shame\" as though men are fully responsible for BV?  If that's not generalizing and talking smack against men I don't know what is?  That's 1 example there are a lot more!!\n\nDiscussing the topic is one thing, but sending a dozen links as though you're a physician and have expertise in this stuff is irresponsible especially online pharmacy links.  Unlike you I don't trust buying pharmaceuticals online, especially when I don't know if anything is wrong  and wouldn't know what to get anyway.  So I go to a real, live, human doctor, get whatever tests based on what the issue may be, and go from there.  You're assertion that I got an STD test when I specifically told them it was related to BV is wrong that's not what they did and you weren't there.  Once again a belligerent assertion you made without having any idea what tests were taken  isn't productive",

I would do the same for anyone I'm dating.  I have never stated this isn't an issue so don't try and spin this like I'm a denier or something.  I did miss the funny named gardnerella bacteria but I'm not a Dr. and don't try to fake like I'm one. \n\nWhat exactly are you wanting from men here?  If a man finds out there's an issue with  his girl, you go get checked and treated if necessary.  Period.  Self diagnosing and buying online medicine isn't nearly as safe or thorough as the process I would take.  So if you're trying to convince everyone that men should take the meds you're recommending they buy online without even being diagnosed that's just irresponsible.  \n\nNeither of us are wrong I just disagree with how it should be treated.

Do I track the science behind BV treatment daily?  No I do not.\n\n Lady I went and got checked out immediately when my partner got BV as a supportive man and at her request, so what did I do wrong?  I would do the same for anyone I'm dating.  I have never stated this isn't an issue so don't try and spin this like I'm a denier or something.  I did miss the funny named gardnerella bacteria but I'm not a Dr. and don't try to fake like I'm one. \n\nWhat exactly are you wanting from men here?  If a man finds out there's an issue with  his girl, you go get checked and treated if necessary.  Period.  Self diagnosing and buying online medicine isn't nearly as safe or thorough as the process I would take.  So if you're trying to convince everyone that men should take the meds you're recommending they buy online without even being diagnosed that's just irresponsible.  \n\nNeither of us are wrong I just disagree with how it should be treated.

You're also posting links to medical journals, articles, and shady drug websites for scripts etc.  Oh if you haven't answered yet... You're not a Doctor correct?  I've asked you like 6 times now\n\n Your whole tone and demeanor throughout this thread has been essentially faking being a Doctor, talking smack on men as though we're to blame and you have the solution (which you don't because you're NOT A DOCTOR).  It's laughable.  \n\nI had the balls to engage in this and admit it exists but you're out for blood, being disrespectful to men who chime in with questions or statements, and just being belligerent in general.  \n\nYou're very angry and people on here, including myself, are trying to help........ but you keep fighting the world if you can't tell who's on your side or not.
