    "body": "I just closed the biggest business deal of my life yesterday! *thanks everyone for the applause* Told my SB about it in the afternoon as I was of course over the moon. We had dinner at a very upscale place. After dinner, I gestured for the bill to a waiter. He placed the bill folder near my left hand. When I opened it, I saw the receipt and a Visa debit card with my SB's name on it. I looked up at her confused, then she took the bill folder from me and said, \"this is my treat for what you achieved today\" + cute smile. \n\nShe then told me that when she excused herself to go to the ladies room earlier, that's when she gave her debit card to the cashier. She doesn't like to pay using her credit card. :-) Is she a catch or is she a catch?! \n\nJust sharing my positive day. :D \n\nEDIT: You bet your sexy sugary asses I'm keeping this girl. :-) ",

Those who give the bare minimum will usually get that back.\n\nThis from one of OP's previous posts\n\n>what I do is I rent out an entire restaurant when I know she\u2019s feeling down\n\nHe sounds like a generous and thoughtful SD who deserves the best from his SB and it seems like he's getting it.\n\nHappy for you OP, hope it continues to bring you happiness :)",
