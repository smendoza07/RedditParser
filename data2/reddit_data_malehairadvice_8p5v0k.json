            "body": "I\u2019ve had roughly the same haircut for 4 years now. I\u2019ve tested all the major product lines and methods but today I think I find a new holy grail. \n\nGot my usual cut (it changes a bit with the season, top length and side length, the beard is a constant WIP). \n\nSteps: \nBlow dry with concentrator - use a small round brush to curl the hair around the brush while pulling back and away from the part. \n\nOnce dry use dry shampoo. We (my barber in the shop and me at home) use the \u201cbeach body\u201d texturizing dry shampoo available at target (forget the brand, super common and in a white and blue bottle). This adds texture and helps give it shape. \n\nMain styling product - slick gorilla styling powder. This stuff is amazing. He sprinkled it in and I was confused at first. He styled it as usual, light finger tips through the hair - the shape is already there from the blow drying and dry shampoo. \n\nQuick spray of hair spray (usually a matte spray that is $30 a bottle at Ulta, today was store brand common crap). \n\nThe photo doesn\u2019t do the matte finish justice - it\u2019s still a bit \u201cwet\u201d from the hair spray. 8.5 hours later, two huge rain storms (used an umbrella but still), 2.5 hours in the gym, and 3 changes of my shirt and I still have a wonderful malleable matte finish to my hair that wouldn\u2019t require much, if any, work to head out somewhere with. \n\nHope this helps some people in search of the perfect hair style! Feel free to ask anything - I\u2019ve been working on my hair for YEARS and it\u2019s always a WIP. \n\nIf you\u2019re in the Central FL area shoot me a PM for info on my barber. He\u2019s cut my hair for over a decade and kills it every time!",

This was a really rough style with just a quick rinse under the shower head \\- I can take some more pictures another time and share them but I think this came out rather well for a quick and easy style.\n\nI also included a few photos from post haircuts and one with my hair after a day out in the sun / wind showing how it looks as it settles throughout the day. Figure I'd share any good ones to give people ideas when going to their barber!\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask! Hope this helps!\n\nEdit: Top length is between 5 and 5.5 inches in the areas I measured. ",

I have to work hard to get it to lay flat. \n\nI wait a few weeks because of availability to see my barber and because as it grows I adjust my style on the sides. I use a beard brush to brush down the hair, hit it with the blow dryer to help keep it down, and apply product on top of that. I\u2019m fortunate my hair grows evenly on the sides and doesn\u2019t look out of shape until the 5-6 week mark.\n\nMy hair without product is light as air, sticks straight out, and is as straight as it can be. It\u2019s unmanageable lol. ",

I could have mounted my GoPro to my mirror and done it better but I was running out of time. This was a really rough style with just a quick rinse under the shower head \\- I can take some more pictures another time and share them but I think this came out rather well for a quick and easy style.\n\nI also included a few photos from post haircuts and one with my hair after a day out in the sun / wind showing how it looks as it settles throughout the day. Figure I'd share any good ones to give people ideas when going to their barber!\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask! Hope this helps!\n\nEdit: Top length is between 5 and 5.5 inches in the areas I measured. ",

I could have mounted my GoPro to my mirror and done it better but I was running out of time. This was a really rough style with just a quick rinse under the shower head \\- I can take some more pictures another time and share them but I think this came out rather well for a quick and easy style.\n\nI also included a few photos from post haircuts and one with my hair after a day out in the sun / wind showing how it looks as it settles throughout the day. Figure I'd share any good ones to give people ideas when going to their barber!\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask! Hope this helps!\n\nEdit: Top length is between 5 and 5.5 inches in the areas I measured. ",
