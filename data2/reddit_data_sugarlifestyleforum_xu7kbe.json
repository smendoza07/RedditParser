    "body": "This is a long post.\n\nI really wish they taught basic business courses in high school or made it mandatory for most college degrees. I think basic economics and marketing would really help many of the SBs (and perhaps some SDs) understand the bowl a lot better and perhaps help you in finding a better SR/arrangement/whatever. \n\nLet's start with the basic economics and the law of supply and demand. I wish I could use graphics, but I'm too lazy to make them or search for the appropriate ones for this discussion. Contrary to popular belief, there isn't \"someone for everyone\" in the bowl and the biggest flaw of using the PPM/allowance thread is making the assumption that all women are \"average\". Are there many \"average\" women? Of course. That's probably the biggest portion of the bell curve. But there are also the highly desirable, and the less desirable. Will they get the same PPM/allowance? No, because the demand goes down dramatically the further you get from being young, fit and conventionally attractive. Is there no demand? Perhaps not, but the whole \"I do well on vanilla sites\" is not an apples to apples comparison as you're now shifting the \"price\" (a component of the supply and demand curve), which causes a shift in demand. Think of it as alcohol. You might not want to pay a lot for a shitty drink, but would gladly drink it if it's free. There is a lot of average to below average SBs (supply) and not a ton of demand for them. There aren't a lot of super attractive SBs, and the demand for them are high. \n\nNow, I realize that many of you reading this is thinking \"well shit, this sucks. I'm average (or below average).\" \n\nHave hope. Not all is lost. This is where marketing comes along. You may want to stop reading here if you're the type that gets easily offended as I will be making analogies and comparisons of SBs to products and services. \n\nThere are things that average SBs (or even below average SBs) can do to help even the playing field and give you a leg up on your competition. From many of the profile reviews I've seen here and reading about the various experiences, it's clear that most SBs aren't thinking about things in terms of marketing. \n\nIt really looks like most hear about sugar and just wing it hoping things work out.\n\nThis works for the hot/attractive ones but many average to below average SBs soon come to realize that it's a lot harder than it looks and struggle. What are you doing wrong? \n\nMarketing 101 and the 4 Ps. \n\nProduct - You are the product. Assess your strengths and weaknesses and emphasize your strengths. What do you have or can provide that's better, different? What is your differentiator? Attractive/hot women can get by on looks alone. Average women have to rely on things like charm, charisma and other \"tangibles\". If you have pretty eyes, highlight them. If you have a great smile, show that off. Big boobs? Nice ass? Can talk dirty? Give a great massage? Can come up with awesome date ideas? Whatever it is that you think you do well, that should be your focus and highlight. No guy cares if you \"like to spend time outdoors, but also like to be indoors\" or if you can \"dress up for a fancy night out, but also look great in jeans and T-shirt\". \n\nPrice - there is no right or wrong PPM/Allowance. Going back to economics and supply and demand, your time is worth what someone else is willing to give you. Someone mentioned in her post earlier that she realized that she has \"priced herself out\". I'm not advocating that anyone lowball themselves or not get what they deserve. Get that bag! Just realize that just because some super hot 24year old from SF got something for an allowance, you, as an average looking, curvy SB in Idaho will not get the same. \n\nPlace - how will a POT/SD find you, if you're not getting in front of them? SA is the largest \"marketplace\" for POT SDs and SBs. If you're not on there and are struggling, you're not really trying. That's like Coors Light not being available at a Walmart and trying to sell themselves to high-end bars instead.\n\nPromotion - if you're struggling and doing the same thing day after day after day, theres's an Einstein quote about you. Try different things. If you don't message POTs, try that. If you don't \"favorite\" profiles, give that a try. Perhaps try being a featured member or using their new vibe feature? Try different things to try to promote yourself and get in front of more POTs. \n\nI hope this helps. I do think that many \"average\" SBs could find a decent POT with the right strategy. Good luck!",

Now I see I managed to make a really interesting profile that was not centered around my looks (I would however put myself in an \u2018attractive\u2019 category). My profile was about my poetry and writing. I truly believe that words are so powerful - I dare say even more powerful then a nice booty or a nice smile. If you are able to seduce men with your words only, imagine what you can do in person. I\u2019m no longer on the site because I found what I was looking for - genius guy, extremely well spoken and intelligent, a millionaire that adores me. So yeah girls - seduce them with words first ;) Good luck!",

The reason a lot of SBs are average is because they are overweight, so perfecting the 4 P's is a waste of time without having more healthy habits. This body positive movement no matter how big is shameful and will not be remembered favourably in the future.\n\nThe formula for gaining weight for nearly everyone is simple: you are not moving enough for the calories you are consuming. We spend too much time in modern society sitting at work, in cars, and on the sofa watching TV; while eating tons of carbs. There is no food that we eat that is over 80% fat or protein. Most meat is around 20% protein and 75% water. But pasta, bread, candy, chocolate, chips, fries, soda, are at least 80% carbs, which the body converts to fat.\n\nIf you want to get that bag, here's 2 much more important P's: Put the fork down, and Prioritize exercise in your life.\n\nIf you are offended by this post, you are condoning life in the Axiom from the movie Wall-E.",

Broke ass people on the site find someone.\n\nI was talking to a potential, he just got out of a four year arrangement with a girl he gave 400/ month allowance to and was looking for an identical arrangement. She spent Fri-Sunday with him. He dolled out basically 2 dollars an hour in allowance. He must have been hot or rich af right? No. Fat, old, ugly, beer belly pregnant, biker, beard to his man titties. He showed me her photo. Young. Pretty. Dumb af.\n\nIf you go on a site, you can find an arrangement. It doesn\u2019t matter how old, ugly, weight, money\u2026\n\nIf you didn\u2019t know this it\u2019s only because the outliers are not as vocal as the perfect tens getting thousands for there hot ten bodies.",

I have three more first dates for coffee or drinks this week. I'm happy. \n\nWhy keep an almost 50 year old SB?

In my main profile pic, there is no face shot... and in fact I am wearing a kaftan.... lol  ... but I suppose it is the way the silk wraps around me that they find alluring. \n\nI also don't wear makeup, and my hair is natural with a few greys at the temples. (I don't have any wrinkles naturally which probably helps.) I am not young enough for many SDs, but good enough that my inbox is rather busy. \n\nSincerely, HowSheWalks",
