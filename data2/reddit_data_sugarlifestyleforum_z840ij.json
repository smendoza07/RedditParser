    "body": "I am currently still in my sugar relationship, if you would call it that. To me, it's a normal relationship but it started as an arrangement. We have had our share of highs and lows and have taken breaks in between.\n\n During those breaks, I have found vanilla dating to be near impossible. It might sound shallow of me, but I am going to say it, I have been living in luxury for the last two years which may not seem like a long time but no part of me ever wants to turn back. If I do, it will likely be again with an older successful man. I have found that I am no longer attracted to men my age (25-30) and I'm not sure that there is anything inherently wrong with that. \n\nHas anyone else has this experience? I have been with my current partner for 2 years and have been in the bowl for almost 4.",

He lived with his dad and I was newly divorced. \n\nWe were young \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nI\u2019ve also had a sugar relationship when we took a break once and same as you\u2019re saying- it just felt like a normal relationship with extra perks as we got comfortable with each other.\n\nBut anyway\u2026 as I\u2019ve stuck by my husband through the years he\u2019s gained lots of good fortune and success, and I\u2019ve caught some shit (behind my back) from people associated with him for \u201cusing\u201d him \ud83d\ude44 which is so far from true. \n\nI AM a housewife. He never has to do dishes, his own laundry or most housework unless I\u2019m sick or injured and need a little help. \nI\u2019m an asset in my own way. \n\nAlso I\u2019m an amazing cook\u2026 even those mouths that speak hate on me show up for the holidays to eat my cooking \ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\ude44 \n\nHe\u2019s helped me raise my 2 kids. \nI only give him what I can part with in the way of money towards bills and that\u2019s more my own conscience than him expecting it. \n\nHe understands that if he wants a hot piece of arm candy it requires maintenance and covers my beauty services and will be helping me pay for plastic surgery once I reach my weight and health goals. \nHe buys my weed and often even covers my friends bill when we go out to eat with them. \n\nI enjoy the dynamic of him using my body to get off, I have a compersion kink\u2026 I\u2019m recently exploring bimbofication so that pairs nicely with my sexual/amorous nature and desired aesthetic.\n\nSo my marriage is basically like a sugar arrangement without cash exchanging hands- with the additional detail of us being genuinely in love and also each other\u2019s best friends. \n\nPeople definitely get really opinionated about it. \nBut to me: those people aren\u2019t being honest with themselves. \n\nI feel every relationship is give and take and give and take at the end of the day is an arrangement/ agreement/transaction. \n\nTrophy wives and sugar babies are one in the same in my book. \n\nAnd your normal everyday woman in a relationship where she\u2019s not the main breadwinner: there isn\u2019t much difference there either- no matter how much of a moral high ground they claim to have.\n\nIn summary: do what makes you happy, it\u2019s your life. You only get one. People who talk are jealous or insecure in some fashion. \n\nThey lash out because it threatens & challenges how they view their own outlook on love. \n\nJust be happy. \ud83d\udc95",

Luxury is subjective to the person living the experience. I was raised by a single mother who worked and went to law school full time and relied on my dads mom for childcare. We got wic and other government assistance. I remember begging my mom for a new pair of jeans as a tween because kids made fun of the clothes I\u2019d been wearing all year and it being a huge deal for her to part with that $20 \n\nSo for someone like ME: dropping hundreds on SHEIN or fashion nova on new clothes = luxury. The very concept that I can fund traveling on occasion is luxury to me.\n\nThe way you\u2019re approaching this question implies that every sugar baby has mansion and country club expectations, but some of us just want to breathe financially. \n\nI\u2019m a simple girl, I feel rich when I\u2019m content and not worried about the bills. When I can treat myself and it not impact another expense that\u2019s a couple days around the corner.\n\nHave I had men hand me thousands? Yeah, and it was awesome and I\u2019m grateful. \n\nBut again these things are subject to personal lived experience and also requires the nuance of factoring in the average young woman\u2019s financial reality in this economy.",

There's also a lot more to talk about as I've always been more mature intellectually. When you have so many options and all other things being equal it's only natural to pick someone who can provide a more interesting and secure life. If we chose partners purely on looks for example then I imagine our species would have died out a long time ago.\n\nI've also found that older men provide me with a lot more emotional stability and are more prepared to put me in my place when needed.\n\nTo answer your question more directly, for me at least, it can't be just about the money. Longer term, I don't see myself settling down with a guy and getting sprogged up who is of a similar age to me so deep down that's probably the real indicator of honest unbiased preference.",

As someone in the early stages of a non-lucrative but high-impact career, that is almost, if not as, important as financial support. I\u2019ve had a SD most of the time I\u2019ve been with my boyfriend, but it\u2019s a different type of relationship. My SDs are more like the patrons/sponsors of an artist, while my boyfriend is doing the work of creating art with me. Both are valuable in different ways.",

SRs are the only place that partners automatically tried to make my life better in similar ways. \n\nI don\u2019t know why. Maybe it\u2019s emotional maturity that comes with age. Maybe it\u2019s easier to see other people when you get some distance from survival mode. Maybe my sample size is too small. \n\nEither way, vanilla felt much more like people using me to feel good about themselves where as sugar has generally felt like people recognizing that they feel good around me. Not sure if that\u2019s clear, but before it was like people wanted to hold on to me because they were afraid of how they would feel if I left so it was just about preserving their happiness as long as possible, even if it used me up in the process. No one in sugar has ever made me feel that way.",

I wouldn\u2019t be in a SR with someone I didn\u2019t have true attraction/chemistry for because no amount of money could make me be with someone I didn\u2019t want to be with. I ensure my SD feels appreciated and cared for, and my SD truly does appreciate everything I do for him and how I make him feel. Even without the financial component I am confident he feels this way (through his genuine actions of learning who I am as a person). Yes, the point of a SR is to be provided for and that is a token of gratitude. That\u2019s the comfort level to it as well- knowing exactly what the relationship is. \n\nIn vanilla dating, the lack of value or respect doesn\u2019t come from lack of money. I can feel this way without financial support, but I\u2019m referring to the guys who don\u2019t even take you on a date and expect you to fuck. Or put no effort into deep conversation- they don\u2019t ask you how your day is, they don\u2019t bother to get to know you, etc. Most are emotionally immature and unavailable. I\u2019m completely aware that high quality men do exist in the vanilla world and I would love to be cared for in this way, but the pool for finding this is much smaller and near impossible on dating apps. So I\u2019m sugar dating until I meet someone organically and who can provide the emotional intelligence I\u2019m seeking.",

I started sugar dating in order to fulfill my emotional need after being fed up searching for a \u201creal\u201d relationship. I don\u2019t need the money as I can support myself without it. My SD actually enjoys providing- it makes rich men feel good to be able to help someone. I think you\u2019re also forgetting the fact that it\u2019s an arrangement on both ends- some men actually prefer this style of dating and don\u2019t expect/need anything more. I actually would be open to a SR turning vanilla, but it\u2019s just not the nature of them. \n\nI am actually NOT choosing shitty vanilla men, hence why I am single. I\u2019m waiting for the \u201cnice guy\u201d to come along. After quite literally 5 years of swiping (and being single) I have come to the conclusion that I will not find my soulmate on tinder/bumble/hinge. Sugar dating however isn\u2019t preventing me from finding a vanilla relationship. I deleted the apps almost a year before I decided to start sugaring. If I met someone I connected with tomorrow then of course I would attempt to pursue it. Unfortunately, I\u2019m introverted and don\u2019t go out much so I don\u2019t run into many people (I know something I need to work on). Being in a SR gives me the sense of what it could be like, and what I hope to find one day.",

And on the flip side, the man feels appreciated, genuinely cared for in all of the ways a man appreciates and she looks at you in a certain way that can\u2019t be faked, or explained really, then the man should keep looking as well. \n\nWhen two people fit, it doesn\u2019t matter how you met or some title to define a particular relationship style. A successful man taking care of a beautiful woman is about as complicated as it needs to be. Why on earth would anyone want to settle for less? I\u2019m taking care of the woman in my life, end of story. Why should a woman have to choose between being cared for by a successful man that she\u2019s attracted to because she likes being treated like she\u2019s special? The inverse of that makes no sense. Easier said than done, yes, but with patience, you attract the energy you give. Never feel bad for having standards for how you want to be treated in a relationship, as long as you\u2019re bringing the same to the table on your side.",

Few peer men are capable of generating the income that older higher level men are, particularly if they are the age of most young SBs in their teens and 20s. So how can you ever achieve happiness with a guy with whom you can marry and raise children with? SDs are not life partner candidates as a general rule. You can probably count the successful SD/SB marriages on one hand. \n\nSo sugar dating is great fun short term, but not for long term.",

If after reading some of those stories, you still can't square yourself with it, you might consider frequenting a different subreddit.",

Luxury is subjective to the person living the experience. I was raised by a single mother who worked and went to law school full time and relied on my dads mom for childcare. We got wic and other government assistance. I remember begging my mom for a new pair of jeans as a tween because kids made fun of the clothes I\u2019d been wearing all year and it being a huge deal for her to part with that $20 \n\nSo for someone like ME: dropping hundreds on SHEIN or fashion nova on new clothes = luxury. The very concept that I can fund traveling on occasion is luxury to me.\n\nThe way you\u2019re approaching this question implies that every sugar baby has mansion and country club expectations, but some of us just want to breathe financially. \n\nI\u2019m a simple girl, I feel rich when I\u2019m content and not worried about the bills. When I can treat myself and it not impact another expense that\u2019s a couple days around the corner.\n\nHave I had men hand me thousands? Yeah, and it was awesome and I\u2019m grateful. \n\nBut again these things are subject to personal lived experience and also requires the nuance of factoring in the average young woman\u2019s financial reality in this economy.",

There's also a lot more to talk about as I've always been more mature intellectually. When you have so many options and all other things being equal it's only natural to pick someone who can provide a more interesting and secure life. If we chose partners purely on looks for example then I imagine our species would have died out a long time ago.\n\nI've also found that older men provide me with a lot more emotional stability and are more prepared to put me in my place when needed.\n\nTo answer your question more directly, for me at least, it can't be just about the money. Longer term, I don't see myself settling down with a guy and getting sprogged up who is of a similar age to me so deep down that's probably the real indicator of honest unbiased preference.",

Maybe it\u2019s easier to see other people when you get some distance from survival mode. Maybe my sample size is too small. \n\nEither way, vanilla felt much more like people using me to feel good about themselves where as sugar has generally felt like people recognizing that they feel good around me. Not sure if that\u2019s clear, but before it was like people wanted to hold on to me because they were afraid of how they would feel if I left so it was just about preserving their happiness as long as possible, even if it used me up in the process.

I wouldn\u2019t be in a SR with someone I didn\u2019t have true attraction/chemistry for because no amount of money could make me be with someone I didn\u2019t want to be with. I ensure my SD feels appreciated and cared for, and my SD truly does appreciate everything I do for him and how I make him feel. Even without the financial component I am confident he feels this way (through his genuine actions of learning who I am as a person). Yes, the point of a SR is to be provided for and that is a token of gratitude. That\u2019s the comfort level to it as well- knowing exactly what the relationship is. \n\nIn vanilla dating, the lack of value or respect doesn\u2019t come from lack of money. I can feel this way without financial support, but I\u2019m referring to the guys who don\u2019t even take you on a date and expect you to fuck. Or put no effort into deep conversation- they don\u2019t ask you how your day is, they don\u2019t bother to get to know you, etc. Most are emotionally immature and unavailable. I\u2019m completely aware that high quality men do exist in the vanilla world and I would love to be cared for in this way, but the pool for finding this is much smaller and near impossible on dating apps. So I\u2019m sugar dating until I meet someone organically and who can provide the emotional intelligence I\u2019m seeking.",

My SD actually enjoys providing- it makes rich men feel good to be able to help someone. I think you\u2019re also forgetting the fact that it\u2019s an arrangement on both ends- some men actually prefer this style of dating and don\u2019t expect/need anything more. I actually would be open to a SR turning vanilla, but it\u2019s just not the nature of them. \n\nI am actually NOT choosing shitty vanilla men, hence why I am single. I\u2019m waiting for the \u201cnice guy\u201d to come along. After quite literally 5 years of swiping (and being single) I have come to the conclusion that I will not find my soulmate on tinder/bumble/hinge. Sugar dating however isn\u2019t preventing me from finding a vanilla relationship. I deleted the apps almost a year before I decided to start sugaring. If I met someone I connected with tomorrow then of course I would attempt to pursue it. Unfortunately, I\u2019m introverted and don\u2019t go out much so I don\u2019t run into many people (I know something I need to work on).

You are more than welcome to have your own context for what it means for you, but with respect, you have no idea what it means should mean or look like for me. Not sure what point of your comment was other than maybe trying to tell me that what I\u2019m describing isn\u2019t a relationship? To which I say I completely disagree because I have my own idea for what I consider to be a relationship for me and my life values. I don\u2019t need someone else to point out what is or isn\u2019t one based on their own interpretations to know what it means, again, for myself.",

Most of us are sugaring for one (or two) reasons:\n\n1.  To date women that are younger/more physically attractive than we could in vanilla;  which to be clear, is very shallow.\n\n2.  Due to being married, which in most cases, is cheating.  (If they have an open relationship, they could again look for vanilla partners - but are choosing a more attractive partner).\n\nI'll never understand how any one in the sugar world would complain about people being shallow.",

Luxury is subjective to the person living the experience. I was raised by a single mother who worked and went to law school full time and relied on my dads mom for childcare. We got wic and other government assistance. I remember begging my mom for a new pair of jeans as a tween because kids made fun of the clothes I\u2019d been wearing all year and it being a huge deal for her to part with that $20 \n\nSo for someone like ME: dropping hundreds on SHEIN or fashion nova on new clothes = luxury. The very concept that I can fund traveling on occasion is luxury to me.\n\nThe way you\u2019re approaching this question implies that every sugar baby has mansion and country club expectations, but some of us just want to breathe financially. \n\nI\u2019m a simple girl, I feel rich when I\u2019m content and not worried about the bills. When I can treat myself and it not impact another expense that\u2019s a couple days around the corner.\n\nHave I had men hand me thousands? Yeah, and it was awesome and I\u2019m grateful. \n\nBut again these things are subject to personal lived experience and also requires the nuance of factoring in the average young woman\u2019s financial reality in this economy.",

SRs are the only place that partners automatically tried to make my life better in similar ways. \n\nI don\u2019t know why. Maybe it\u2019s emotional maturity that comes with age. Maybe it\u2019s easier to see other people when you get some distance from survival mode. Maybe my sample size is too small. \n\nEither way, vanilla felt much more like people using me to feel good about themselves where as sugar has generally felt like people recognizing that they feel good around me. Not sure if that\u2019s clear, but before it was like people wanted to hold on to me because they were afraid of how they would feel if I left so it was just about preserving their happiness as long as possible, even if it used me up in the process. No one in sugar has ever made me feel that way.",

I wouldn\u2019t be in a SR with someone I didn\u2019t have true attraction/chemistry for because no amount of money could make me be with someone I didn\u2019t want to be with. I ensure my SD feels appreciated and cared for, and my SD truly does appreciate everything I do for him and how I make him feel. Even without the financial component I am confident he feels this way (through his genuine actions of learning who I am as a person). Yes, the point of a SR is to be provided for and that is a token of gratitude. That\u2019s the comfort level to it as well- knowing exactly what the relationship is. \n\nIn vanilla dating, the lack of value or respect doesn\u2019t come from lack of money. I can feel this way without financial support, but I\u2019m referring to the guys who don\u2019t even take you on a date and expect you to fuck. Or put no effort into deep conversation- they don\u2019t ask you how your day is, they don\u2019t bother to get to know you, etc. Most are emotionally immature and unavailable. I\u2019m completely aware that high quality men do exist in the vanilla world and I would love to be cared for in this way, but the pool for finding this is much smaller and near impossible on dating apps. So I\u2019m sugar dating until I meet someone organically and who can provide the emotional intelligence I\u2019m seeking.",

I started sugar dating in order to fulfill my emotional need after being fed up searching for a \u201creal\u201d relationship. I don\u2019t need the money as I can support myself without it. My SD actually enjoys providing- it makes rich men feel good to be able to help someone. I think you\u2019re also forgetting the fact that it\u2019s an arrangement on both ends- some men actually prefer this style of dating and don\u2019t expect/need anything more. I actually would be open to a SR turning vanilla, but it\u2019s just not the nature of them. \n\nI am actually NOT choosing shitty vanilla men, hence why I am single. I\u2019m waiting for the \u201cnice guy\u201d to come along. After quite literally 5 years of swiping (and being single) I have come to the conclusion that I will not find my soulmate on tinder/bumble/hinge. Sugar dating however isn\u2019t preventing me from finding a vanilla relationship. I deleted the apps almost a year before I decided to start sugaring. If I met someone I connected with tomorrow then of course I would attempt to pursue it. Unfortunately, I\u2019m introverted and don\u2019t go out much so I don\u2019t run into many people (I know something I need to work on). Being in a SR gives me the sense of what it could be like, and what I hope to find one day.",

I.e. you can start with a SD/SB dynamic but eventually you both have to be willing to transition to vanilla before it can become serious (yes I consider trophy wife a serious relationship).",

Luxury is subjective to the person living the experience. I was raised by a single mother who worked and went to law school full time and relied on my dads mom for childcare. We got wic and other government assistance. I remember begging my mom for a new pair of jeans as a tween because kids made fun of the clothes I\u2019d been wearing all year and it being a huge deal for her to part with that $20 \n\nSo for someone like ME: dropping hundreds on SHEIN or fashion nova on new clothes = luxury. The very concept that I can fund traveling on occasion is luxury to me.\n\nThe way you\u2019re approaching this question implies that every sugar baby has mansion and country club expectations, but some of us just want to breathe financially. \n\nI\u2019m a simple girl, I feel rich when I\u2019m content and not worried about the bills. When I can treat myself and it not impact another expense that\u2019s a couple days around the corner.\n\nHave I had men hand me thousands? Yeah, and it was awesome and I\u2019m grateful. \n\nBut again these things are subject to personal lived experience and also requires the nuance of factoring in the average young woman\u2019s financial reality in this economy.",

Maybe it\u2019s easier to see other people when you get some distance from survival mode. Maybe my sample size is too small. \n\nEither way, vanilla felt much more like people using me to feel good about themselves where as sugar has generally felt like people recognizing that they feel good around me. Not sure if that\u2019s clear, but before it was like people wanted to hold on to me because they were afraid of how they would feel if I left so it was just about preserving their happiness as long as possible, even if it used me up in the process. No one in sugar has ever made me feel that way.",

I ensure my SD feels appreciated and cared for, and my SD truly does appreciate everything I do for him and how I make him feel. Even without the financial component I am confident he feels this way (through his genuine actions of learning who I am as a person). Yes, the point of a SR is to be provided for and that is a token of gratitude. That\u2019s the comfort level to it as well- knowing exactly what the relationship is. \n\nIn vanilla dating, the lack of value or respect doesn\u2019t come from lack of money. I can feel this way without financial support, but I\u2019m referring to the guys who don\u2019t even take you on a date and expect you to fuck. Or put no effort into deep conversation- they don\u2019t ask you how your day is, they don\u2019t bother to get to know you, etc. Most are emotionally immature and unavailable. I\u2019m completely aware that high quality men do exist in the vanilla world and I would love to be cared for in this way, but the pool for finding this is much smaller and near impossible on dating apps. So I\u2019m sugar dating until I meet someone organically and who can provide the emotional intelligence I\u2019m seeking.",

After quite literally 5 years of swiping (and being single) I have come to the conclusion that I will not find my soulmate on tinder/bumble/hinge. Sugar dating however isn\u2019t preventing me from finding a vanilla relationship. I deleted the apps almost a year before I decided to start sugaring. If I met someone I connected with tomorrow then of course I would attempt to pursue it. Unfortunately, I\u2019m introverted and don\u2019t go out much so I don\u2019t run into many people (I know something I need to work on). Being in a SR gives me the sense of what it could be like, and what I hope to find one day.",

Luxury is subjective to the person living the experience. I was raised by a single mother who worked and went to law school full time and relied on my dads mom for childcare. We got wic and other government assistance. I remember begging my mom for a new pair of jeans as a tween because kids made fun of the clothes I\u2019d been wearing all year and it being a huge deal for her to part with that $20 \n\nSo for someone like ME: dropping hundreds on SHEIN or fashion nova on new clothes = luxury. The very concept that I can fund traveling on occasion is luxury to me.\n\nThe way you\u2019re approaching this question implies that every sugar baby has mansion and country club expectations, but some of us just want to breathe financially. \n\nI\u2019m a simple girl, I feel rich when I\u2019m content and not worried about the bills. When I can treat myself and it not impact another expense that\u2019s a couple days around the corner.\n\nHave I had men hand me thousands? Yeah, and it was awesome and I\u2019m grateful. \n\nBut again these things are subject to personal lived experience and also requires the nuance of factoring in the average young woman\u2019s financial reality in this economy.",

I don\u2019t need the money as I can support myself without it. My SD actually enjoys providing- it makes rich men feel good to be able to help someone. I think you\u2019re also forgetting the fact that it\u2019s an arrangement on both ends- some men actually prefer this style of dating and don\u2019t expect/need anything more. I actually would be open to a SR turning vanilla, but it\u2019s just not the nature of them. \n\nI am actually NOT choosing shitty vanilla men, hence why I am single. I\u2019m waiting for the \u201cnice guy\u201d to come along. After quite literally 5 years of swiping (and being single) I have come to the conclusion that I will not find my soulmate on tinder/bumble/hinge. Sugar dating however isn\u2019t preventing me from finding a vanilla relationship. I deleted the apps almost a year before I decided to start sugaring. If I met someone I connected with tomorrow then of course I would attempt to pursue it. Unfortunately, I\u2019m introverted and don\u2019t go out much so I don\u2019t run into many people (I know something I need to work on). Being in a SR gives me the sense of what it could be like, and what I hope to find one day.",

Luxury is subjective to the person living the experience. I was raised by a single mother who worked and went to law school full time and relied on my dads mom for childcare. We got wic and other government assistance. I remember begging my mom for a new pair of jeans as a tween because kids made fun of the clothes I\u2019d been wearing all year and it being a huge deal for her to part with that $20 \n\nSo for someone like ME: dropping hundreds on SHEIN or fashion nova on new clothes = luxury. The very concept that I can fund traveling on occasion is luxury to me.\n\nThe way you\u2019re approaching this question implies that every sugar baby has mansion and country club expectations, but some of us just want to breathe financially. \n\nI\u2019m a simple girl, I feel rich when I\u2019m content and not worried about the bills. When I can treat myself and it not impact another expense that\u2019s a couple days around the corner.\n\nHave I had men hand me thousands? Yeah, and it was awesome and I\u2019m grateful. \n\nBut again these things are subject to personal lived experience and also requires the nuance of factoring in the average young woman\u2019s financial reality in this economy.",

I\u2019m waiting for the \u201cnice guy\u201d to come along. After quite literally 5 years of swiping (and being single) I have come to the conclusion that I will not find my soulmate on tinder/bumble/hinge. Sugar dating however isn\u2019t preventing me from finding a vanilla relationship. I deleted the apps almost a year before I decided to start sugaring. If I met someone I connected with tomorrow then of course I would attempt to pursue it. Unfortunately, I\u2019m introverted and don\u2019t go out much so I don\u2019t run into many people (I know something I need to work on).

I think if you did some searching and reading, you'd find lots of stories of how full and rewarding these relationships can be. If after reading some of those stories, you still can't square yourself with it, you might consider frequenting a different subreddit.",
