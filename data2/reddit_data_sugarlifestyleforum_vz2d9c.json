    "body": "Hi guys this year we've decided to try something a bit different. Instead of publically posting allowance numbers on this thread we've found a way to gather information anonymously. This new format also allows us to go more in-depth without the risk of anyone doxing themselves. \n\nIt is my hope that this new format allows people to be more honest about their allowances, arrangements, and themselves since it won't be tied to their SLF persona. Hopefully this will help get rid of the backlash people get when they posts on the allowance thread.\n\n**A little about the new format...**\n\nIt is a questionnaire with 3 parts. \n\n* Part 1 is General demographics. Age, marital status, race/ethnicity, education level for you and your partner.  \n\n* Part 2 is more detailed info about your arrangement such as are you exclusive, do you have more than one partner, do you do overnights, etc.\n\n* Part 3 is about your location. No need to be vague since this is anonymous. It will help us get more accurate numbers for specific locations. Don't put Northwest Florida put Pensacola if that is your location.  \n\n**Things to be aware of**\n\n* If you are on PPM or give PPM use the amount per a meet when answering the money questions not a monthly number. So if you get $500 PPM and meet 4 times a month put/choose that amount not the cumulative amount of $2k.\n\n* If you have more than one SR with differing information do not combine them into one questionnaire. Fill out a separate one or just pick your main SR.  If the information is the same for each arrangement just fill out once. Meaning if you have 2 SDs/SBs and you give or receive the same to/from both ($500) than report it once as $500  not as $1,000.\n\n* Only provide current information. If it's not from an arrangement from this year do not include it or fill out a questionnaire. It's not helpful to receive info from your arrangement from 2020. \n\n* Don't include information for offers you received. If you didn't have an arrangement with that person and actually received the cold hard cash in your hands/bank account don't report it. \n\n* If you didn't have an In Real Life arrangement don't participate. This is not for content sellers/cam girls. As far as SLF is concerned there is no such thing as an online sugar relationship and we don't want any info for that. \n\n**How the information will be shared**\n\nThis questionnaire automatically compiles the information entered into graphs and reports. A link to those will be added on to this post and will be updated weekly on Mondays until the window for updating this post is closed. So do not go through the questionnaire and enter bogus answers because you think you'll see results at the end you will not. \n\nIf you have any questions or comments unlike in previous master threads you are welcome to discuss it in this post. You are also welcome to post your personal allowance number here as well if you want instead of being anonymous. Just include your location and whether it's PPM, etc. \n\n**LINK TO QUESTIONNAIRE**\n\n**Link to Results** (will be live July 25)",

There was only one report that it wouldn't generate which was how much allowance for specific locations. \n\nSo to bypass that if you add the allowance next to your city. It will populate an excel sheet with the names of the city and the amounts each individual reports. so instead of just Miami it'll say Miami 3k. That was the best solution I could come up with at 3am  without investing more time into this or trying to find an alternative platform.",

There was only one report that it wouldn't generate which was how much allowance for specific locations. \n\nSo to bypass that if you add the allowance next to your city. It will populate an excel sheet with the names of the city and the amounts each individual reports. so instead of just Miami it'll say Miami 3k.

It will populate an excel sheet with the names of the city and the amounts each individual reports. so instead of just Miami it'll say Miami 3k.

It will populate an excel sheet with the names of the city and the amounts each individual reports. so instead of just Miami it'll say Miami 3k.
