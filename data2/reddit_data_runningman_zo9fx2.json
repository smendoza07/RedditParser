If they can give the Daesang to the whole MUD cast last year then it's just appropriate to give it to JSJ this year as ultimate appreciation for his service.\n\nThe whole members and fans were hyping up JSJ this year and SBS know this. SBS know how awkward it will be for JSJ and everyone when another member wins it. They know it will create some news and stories and they love it. \n\nThey just don't take JSJ seriously. Giving a side award last year and this year made JSJ went up on the stage with that ID tag to talk about that award again.",

Hear me out:\n\nIn the 1997 season of the NBA, Karl Malone won MVP despite Michael Jordan having the best stats. Why? Because of voter fatigue; voter fatigue is when people think a nominee has won enough so they vote for someone else instead.\n\nIn 2008, the MVP race in the NBA was between Chris Paul and Kobe Bryant. Kobe at that point was near mythical; however he hadn't gotten an MVP award. Meanwhile Chris Paul was a superstar PG who was putting slightly superior stats to Kobe. But Kobe won that year, why is that? Because there were many years that he was close to winning them, and he deserved to get one for the performances he had over the years. It's like a respect MVP.\n\nJSJ deserved to get a respect daesang this year. I think the majority of Knetz and RM fans here will agree with me that YJS has enough daesangs, he doesn't need one more, even if he has \"superior stats\" to JSJ. It would also be an apology to the bad taste joke they did last year, and show that SBS is in touch with their audience more than just seeing them through ratings numbers. Sadly that's not the case.",

But this time, this one time, I was also very much rooting for Ji Suk jin to win the Daesang.  Ji Suk Jin is literally one of the legs of RM, without JSJ to me I'm confident to say Running Man wouldnt be the same. From Easy brothers to sunflower JSJ to the \"I swear\" moment which for me created one of the first LOL moments in the show, his comedic timing, his ability to make awkward moments fun and make boring moments exciting, JSJ's presence makes a whole lot of difference in this show.\n\nYoo Jae suk is also a legend and RM wouldnt be the same without him either. Not only is YJS a member but I also think he is  mastermind and a secret staff member lol who also gives ideas and offers constant encouragement to the staff, so that counts too.  I guess to win a daesang is more than what you bring into the show. I'm sad for JSJ but Yoo Jae suk congrats and Good luck for JSJ next year!",

Hear me out:\n\nIn the 1997 season of the NBA, Karl Malone won MVP despite Michael Jordan having the best stats. Why? Because of voter fatigue; voter fatigue is when people think a nominee has won enough so they vote for someone else instead.\n\nIn 2008, the MVP race in the NBA was between Chris Paul and Kobe Bryant. Kobe at that point was near mythical; however he hadn't gotten an MVP award. Meanwhile Chris Paul was a superstar PG who was putting slightly superior stats to Kobe. But Kobe won that year, why is that? Because there were many years that he was close to winning them, and he deserved to get one for the performances he had over the years. It's like a respect MVP.\n\nJSJ deserved to get a respect daesang this year. I think the majority of Knetz and RM fans here will agree with me that YJS has enough daesangs, he doesn't need one more, even if he has \"superior stats\" to JSJ. It would also be an apology to the bad taste joke they did last year, and show that SBS is in touch with their audience more than just seeing them through ratings numbers. Sadly that's not the case.",

Hear me out:\n\nIn the 1997 season of the NBA, Karl Malone won MVP despite Michael Jordan having the best stats. Why? Because of voter fatigue; voter fatigue is when people think a nominee has won enough so they vote for someone else instead.\n\nIn 2008, the MVP race in the NBA was between Chris Paul and Kobe Bryant. Kobe at that point was near mythical; however he hadn't gotten an MVP award. Meanwhile Chris Paul was a superstar PG who was putting slightly superior stats to Kobe. But Kobe won that year, why is that? Because there were many years that he was close to winning them, and he deserved to get one for the performances he had over the years. It's like a respect MVP.\n\nJSJ deserved to get a respect daesang this year. I think the majority of Knetz and RM fans here will agree with me that YJS has enough daesangs, he doesn't need one more, even if he has \"superior stats\" to JSJ. It would also be an apology to the bad taste joke they did last year, and show that SBS is in touch with their audience more than just seeing them through ratings numbers. Sadly that's not the case.",
