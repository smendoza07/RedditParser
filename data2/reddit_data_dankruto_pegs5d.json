Shippuden Sakura was a bit decent and I really wished she did more, because she was also trained under a Sannin and had the potential. Sakura had her moments and Kishi robbed us from not animating Sasuke Retsuden (which is epic btw) where its shown the actual parts of sakura. In Boruto, she's established as the most useful person, next to Ino cause they're actively working and Sakura had a hospital open and ran just to treat mental illness so no one becomes a mess like Kakashi, Naruto or Sasuke. If that isnt a good character development in a subtle way, idk what is.",

But even so, Sakura had a lot of relatable traits. When I was a preteen, there weren't many shows that had relatable female characters. Sakura was awkward, annoying, stubborn and had silly notions of love. Most girls who watched this show around 12 years of age were probably able to see something of herself in them. That's something few anime did at the time, and those that did were either magical girl anime, or had a lot of fan service. To a lot of dudes, and maybe even females, Sakura was super annoying. But to a lot of us, Sakura was the most relatable character in the show. She wasn't OP, she was struggling to fit in, and she was in love with someone who was basically unreachable. Honestly, I don't know the gender of most Sakura haters, but I wished you would all look at her from the perspective of a 12 year old girl going through a similar phase in their life. We aren't going to look at Tsunade and see ourselves in her. It's going to be either Ino, Hinata or Sakura, and Sakura was the most realistic out of the three. \n\nHer attitude towards Naruto was bad, but that's pretty much how all immature 12 year olds act when they want to fit in. Herd mentality. Why should we expect her to understand empathy? At that point in the storyline where she makes fun of orphans, Kishimoto hadn't fully established just how many orphans were out there. Instead, he made it sound like Naruto was ostracized because of the PARENTS of the other kids at the academy telling them to stay away from him. \n\nShippuden Sakura is pretty useful. Not really for fighting, aside from Chidori, but for keeping people alive. It wasn't flashy, and it wasn't cool, but she did her job well. Telling Naruto she loved him was a dick move, but like, she was also a 16 year old who spends her days reading books, training and studying. Canonically, she had little experience with love (or friendships), and therefore had little experience with being able to understand the impact of her words on other people. She thought her words would do one thing, and it backfired because she was unable to fully understand Naruto. \n\nShe isn't selfish. She was just an awkward teenager who readers expected to be able navigate relationships like an adult. Kishimoto did her dirty, not giving her anymore good fights. \n\nBoruto Sakura is probably one of the best (single) parents in anime. She raised an amazing daughter on her own, runs a hospital, and is upfront in talking to her daughter about her worries, instead of bottling up and allowing Sarada to go on dangerous missions. Her relationship with Sasuke is kinda odd, but honestly it just reminds me of normal military families with frequently deploying spouses. \n\nSasuke sucks though.",

The reasoning was that Sasuke was always away on dangerous missions to protect Konoha. Not to mention, he can teleport but he never used it to visit in 11+ years. But, once Sarada finally finds him, all of the sudden he's at the village every other day like it's no big deal. Like, as if he could have came home every once in a while before that point. But then on top of that, despite him not having seen Sarada in years, he takes Boruto on as an apprentice and spends the majority of his screen time together with him. Not with Sarada, his daughter, but his best friends son.\n\nOn top of that, as a lover, Sakura still acts like she's a newlywed. Why? Because Sasuke was never around. He knocked her up and vanished. And the writers of both the manga and the show have shown very few intimate moment between the two of them since Sasuke got back in the picture. Like, WTF? \n\nSame thing with Naruto. Boruto and Himawari begged him to spend more time with them at the beginning of the series, but it was a no. Then, Boruto finally acts out and fucks up in public, and now all of the sudden Naruto has figured out a way to spend more time with his family. All of the sudden having a family and being hokage is doable. And then Kawaki shows and now, magically, the Hokage can throw everything aside and spend ALL his time following this random kid around. If he can spend his time with Kawaki and still be hokage, why couldn't he do that for his own kids years ago?\n\nThey both really suck as fathers.",

And it's true, their children do like them, as all children inexplicably love their parents, even when their parents are assholes.\n\nBut as an adult, looking on the actions of these other adults, they're kind of irredeemable as parents. Naruto had Hinata, and if Hinata is the tough, loving parent she is made out to be, I'm sure Hinata would have said something to Naruto about how much the children want him around. I get that he was an orphan and may have felt that Hinata's presence was enough for the kids, but it doesn't change the fact that he was extremely neglectful, for years. Its on him for prioritizing a village over his children. His children didnt deserve to live in the shadow of neglectful childhood. He had access to advisors, friends and his good ole teammate Sakura has a hospital dedicated to trauma. I don't think his inability to parent has to do with him being traumatized, I think Naruto literally just saw his own children like everyone else in the village: as his \"family\". Not as his offspring, but as another member of the community he has to keep safe because he is Hokage. It's also on Naruto for sending Sasuke on mission after mission outside of the village. Within the 11 years of sending Sasuke on missions, he never convinced the guy to come home. He let his best friend miss out on every milestone with Sarada. \n\nSasuke's family trauma makes sense: he did see everyone murdered.  But he also had an extreme love for his father as a child, and for Itachi, which he treasured, and instead of passing the sentiment to Sarada, he just left Sakura to provide all the love. From my understanding, everyone from OG Naruto had kids around 19 years of age. That is really young, and not really enough time for Sasuke to get past his extreme trauma. BUT, again, Sasuke has the ability to teleport, and he NEVER visited. And then when he showed up, he became this bumbling awkward father who doesn't seem to have much trauma related to child rearing. There are no signs of PTSD. He's just awkward. It looks to me like he just went out for a pack of smokes and ran away for 11 years. \n\nEither it's poor character development, or, in my opinion, these two just suck as parents.",

The culprit asked to speak with Naruto, and is currently being interviewed by both Naruto and Shikamaru. \n\nWhy did Naruto allow Shikamaru to be in that room, when his kid has a literal bomb strapped to his neck? He is asking Shikamaru to keep it together and interview the guy, as if Shikamaru is the only person available to do this interview. That's totally messed up. Shikamaru is worried his son is going to die, and Naruto is asking him to stay calm and be polite to the culprit instead of getting someone else from ANBU to stand in there.  \n\nShikamaru should not be in that room, but he is because Naruto is allowing it. Shikamaru should be watching behind the glass. Even if Shikamaru wanted to be in there, that's borderline mental abuse. \n\nNaruto has zero awareness as a parent.",

Better than Ten Ten if we take comparison cause Ten Ten wanted to be like Tsunade (as she stated during their introductions to Might Guy). Shippuden Sakura was a bit decent and I really wished she did more, because she was also trained under a Sannin and had the potential. Sakura had her moments and Kishi robbed us from not animating Sasuke Retsuden (which is epic btw) where its shown the actual parts of sakura. In Boruto, she's established as the most useful person, next to Ino cause they're actively working and Sakura had a hospital open and ran just to treat mental illness so no one becomes a mess like Kakashi, Naruto or Sasuke.

Sakura was awkward, annoying, stubborn and had silly notions of love. Most girls who watched this show around 12 years of age were probably able to see something of herself in them. That's something few anime did at the time, and those that did were either magical girl anime, or had a lot of fan service. To a lot of dudes, and maybe even females, Sakura was super annoying. But to a lot of us, Sakura was the most relatable character in the show. She wasn't OP, she was struggling to fit in, and she was in love with someone who was basically unreachable. Honestly, I don't know the gender of most Sakura haters, but I wished you would all look at her from the perspective of a 12 year old girl going through a similar phase in their life. We aren't going to look at Tsunade and see ourselves in her. It's going to be either Ino, Hinata or Sakura, and Sakura was the most realistic out of the three. \n\nHer attitude towards Naruto was bad, but that's pretty much how all immature 12 year olds act when they want to fit in. Herd mentality. Why should we expect her to understand empathy? At that point in the storyline where she makes fun of orphans, Kishimoto hadn't fully established just how many orphans were out there. Instead, he made it sound like Naruto was ostracized because of the PARENTS of the other kids at the academy telling them to stay away from him. \n\nShippuden Sakura is pretty useful. Not really for fighting, aside from Chidori, but for keeping people alive. It wasn't flashy, and it wasn't cool, but she did her job well. Telling Naruto she loved him was a dick move, but like, she was also a 16 year old who spends her days reading books, training and studying. Canonically, she had little experience with love (or friendships), and therefore had little experience with being able to understand the impact of her words on other people. She thought her words would do one thing, and it backfired because she was unable to fully understand Naruto. \n\nShe isn't selfish. She was just an awkward teenager who readers expected to be able navigate relationships like an adult. Kishimoto did her dirty, not giving her anymore good fights. \n\nBoruto Sakura is probably one of the best (single) parents in anime. She raised an amazing daughter on her own, runs a hospital, and is upfront in talking to her daughter about her worries, instead of bottling up and allowing Sarada to go on dangerous missions. Her relationship with Sasuke is kinda odd, but honestly it just reminds me of normal military families with frequently deploying spouses. \n\nSasuke sucks though.",

The reasoning was that Sasuke was always away on dangerous missions to protect Konoha. Not to mention, he can teleport but he never used it to visit in 11+ years. But, once Sarada finally finds him, all of the sudden he's at the village every other day like it's no big deal. Like, as if he could have came home every once in a while before that point. But then on top of that, despite him not having seen Sarada in years, he takes Boruto on as an apprentice and spends the majority of his screen time together with him. Not with Sarada, his daughter, but his best friends son.\n\nOn top of that, as a lover, Sakura still acts like she's a newlywed. Why? Because Sasuke was never around. He knocked her up and vanished. And the writers of both the manga and the show have shown very few intimate moment between the two of them since Sasuke got back in the picture. Like, WTF? \n\nSame thing with Naruto. Boruto and Himawari begged him to spend more time with them at the beginning of the series, but it was a no. Then, Boruto finally acts out and fucks up in public, and now all of the sudden Naruto has figured out a way to spend more time with his family. All of the sudden having a family and being hokage is doable. And then Kawaki shows and now, magically, the Hokage can throw everything aside and spend ALL his time following this random kid around. If he can spend his time with Kawaki and still be hokage, why couldn't he do that for his own kids years ago?\n\nThey both really suck as fathers.",

And it's true, their children do like them, as all children inexplicably love their parents, even when their parents are assholes.\n\nBut as an adult, looking on the actions of these other adults, they're kind of irredeemable as parents. Naruto had Hinata, and if Hinata is the tough, loving parent she is made out to be, I'm sure Hinata would have said something to Naruto about how much the children want him around. I get that he was an orphan and may have felt that Hinata's presence was enough for the kids, but it doesn't change the fact that he was extremely neglectful, for years. Its on him for prioritizing a village over his children. His children didnt deserve to live in the shadow of neglectful childhood. He had access to advisors, friends and his good ole teammate Sakura has a hospital dedicated to trauma. I don't think his inability to parent has to do with him being traumatized, I think Naruto literally just saw his own children like everyone else in the village: as his \"family\". Not as his offspring, but as another member of the community he has to keep safe because he is Hokage. It's also on Naruto for sending Sasuke on mission after mission outside of the village. Within the 11 years of sending Sasuke on missions, he never convinced the guy to come home. He let his best friend miss out on every milestone with Sarada. \n\nSasuke's family trauma makes sense: he did see everyone murdered.  But he also had an extreme love for his father as a child, and for Itachi, which he treasured, and instead of passing the sentiment to Sarada, he just left Sakura to provide all the love. From my understanding, everyone from OG Naruto had kids around 19 years of age. That is really young, and not really enough time for Sasuke to get past his extreme trauma. BUT, again, Sasuke has the ability to teleport, and he NEVER visited. And then when he showed up, he became this bumbling awkward father who doesn't seem to have much trauma related to child rearing. There are no signs of PTSD. He's just awkward. It looks to me like he just went out for a pack of smokes and ran away for 11 years. \n\nEither it's poor character development, or, in my opinion, these two just suck as parents.",

He is asking Shikamaru to keep it together and interview the guy, as if Shikamaru is the only person available to do this interview. That's totally messed up. Shikamaru is worried his son is going to die, and Naruto is asking him to stay calm and be polite to the culprit instead of getting someone else from ANBU to stand in there.  \n\nShikamaru should not be in that room, but he is because Naruto is allowing it.

Hinata, being the major wants to demolish the old system, but Neji, being the minor-but-guardian wants to kill Hinata--but sees the survival of his clan as more important, leaving him with an inner struggle to protect her, while also wanting her deader than dead.\n\nHinata knows this, and knows she is weaker, but hopes that someday he'll accept her proposal to design a new legacy. \n\nOne day, Neji is close to killing Hinata, but Dankruto shows up, and throw a series of blunders, kisses Neji. \n\nHinata, now left with the shame of having lost Naruto's FIRST and Second (as far as she knows) kiss, decides to destroy the old legacy by touring the world in search of the best ramen.\n\nDuring her travels she becomes obese and gets diabetes. She returns to village years later only to find Neji and Dankruto have started a \"Broy's  Club\" that also includes Sasuke; they joke a lot, poke each other a lot, hold long stares and move each other's hair from their eyes all the time.\n\nHinata dies from heartbreak.

Better than Ten Ten if we take comparison cause Ten Ten wanted to be like Tsunade (as she stated during their introductions to Might Guy). Shippuden Sakura was a bit decent and I really wished she did more, because she was also trained under a Sannin and had the potential. Sakura had her moments and Kishi robbed us from not animating Sasuke Retsuden (which is epic btw) where its shown the actual parts of sakura. In Boruto, she's established as the most useful person, next to Ino cause they're actively working and Sakura had a hospital open and ran just to treat mental illness so no one becomes a mess like Kakashi, Naruto or Sasuke. If that isnt a good character development in a subtle way, idk what is.",

The reasoning was that Sasuke was always away on dangerous missions to protect Konoha. Not to mention, he can teleport but he never used it to visit in 11+ years. But, once Sarada finally finds him, all of the sudden he's at the village every other day like it's no big deal. Like, as if he could have came home every once in a while before that point. But then on top of that, despite him not having seen Sarada in years, he takes Boruto on as an apprentice and spends the majority of his screen time together with him. Not with Sarada, his daughter, but his best friends son.\n\nOn top of that, as a lover, Sakura still acts like she's a newlywed. Why? Because Sasuke was never around. He knocked her up and vanished. And the writers of both the manga and the show have shown very few intimate moment between the two of them since Sasuke got back in the picture. Like, WTF? \n\nSame thing with Naruto. Boruto and Himawari begged him to spend more time with them at the beginning of the series, but it was a no. Then, Boruto finally acts out and fucks up in public, and now all of the sudden Naruto has figured out a way to spend more time with his family. All of the sudden having a family and being hokage is doable. And then Kawaki shows and now, magically, the Hokage can throw everything aside and spend ALL his time following this random kid around. If he can spend his time with Kawaki and still be hokage, why couldn't he do that for his own kids years ago?\n\nThey both really suck as fathers.",

And it's true, their children do like them, as all children inexplicably love their parents, even when their parents are assholes.\n\nBut as an adult, looking on the actions of these other adults, they're kind of irredeemable as parents. Naruto had Hinata, and if Hinata is the tough, loving parent she is made out to be, I'm sure Hinata would have said something to Naruto about how much the children want him around. I get that he was an orphan and may have felt that Hinata's presence was enough for the kids, but it doesn't change the fact that he was extremely neglectful, for years. Its on him for prioritizing a village over his children. His children didnt deserve to live in the shadow of neglectful childhood. He had access to advisors, friends and his good ole teammate Sakura has a hospital dedicated to trauma. I don't think his inability to parent has to do with him being traumatized, I think Naruto literally just saw his own children like everyone else in the village: as his \"family\". Not as his offspring, but as another member of the community he has to keep safe because he is Hokage. It's also on Naruto for sending Sasuke on mission after mission outside of the village. Within the 11 years of sending Sasuke on missions, he never convinced the guy to come home. He let his best friend miss out on every milestone with Sarada. \n\nSasuke's family trauma makes sense: he did see everyone murdered.  But he also had an extreme love for his father as a child, and for Itachi, which he treasured, and instead of passing the sentiment to Sarada, he just left Sakura to provide all the love. From my understanding, everyone from OG Naruto had kids around 19 years of age. That is really young, and not really enough time for Sasuke to get past his extreme trauma. BUT, again, Sasuke has the ability to teleport, and he NEVER visited. And then when he showed up, he became this bumbling awkward father who doesn't seem to have much trauma related to child rearing. There are no signs of PTSD. He's just awkward. It looks to me like he just went out for a pack of smokes and ran away for 11 years. \n\nEither it's poor character development, or, in my opinion, these two just suck as parents.",

Shikamaru is worried his son is going to die, and Naruto is asking him to stay calm and be polite to the culprit instead of getting someone else from ANBU to stand in there.  \n\nShikamaru should not be in that room, but he is because Naruto is allowing it.

The reasoning was that Sasuke was always away on dangerous missions to protect Konoha. Not to mention, he can teleport but he never used it to visit in 11+ years. But, once Sarada finally finds him, all of the sudden he's at the village every other day like it's no big deal. Like, as if he could have came home every once in a while before that point. But then on top of that, despite him not having seen Sarada in years, he takes Boruto on as an apprentice and spends the majority of his screen time together with him. Not with Sarada, his daughter, but his best friends son.\n\nOn top of that, as a lover, Sakura still acts like she's a newlywed. Why? Because Sasuke was never around. He knocked her up and vanished. And the writers of both the manga and the show have shown very few intimate moment between the two of them since Sasuke got back in the picture. Like, WTF? \n\nSame thing with Naruto. Boruto and Himawari begged him to spend more time with them at the beginning of the series, but it was a no. Then, Boruto finally acts out and fucks up in public, and now all of the sudden Naruto has figured out a way to spend more time with his family. All of the sudden having a family and being hokage is doable. And then Kawaki shows and now, magically, the Hokage can throw everything aside and spend ALL his time following this random kid around. If he can spend his time with Kawaki and still be hokage, why couldn't he do that for his own kids years ago?\n\nThey both really suck as fathers.",

And it's true, their children do like them, as all children inexplicably love their parents, even when their parents are assholes.\n\nBut as an adult, looking on the actions of these other adults, they're kind of irredeemable as parents. Naruto had Hinata, and if Hinata is the tough, loving parent she is made out to be, I'm sure Hinata would have said something to Naruto about how much the children want him around. I get that he was an orphan and may have felt that Hinata's presence was enough for the kids, but it doesn't change the fact that he was extremely neglectful, for years. Its on him for prioritizing a village over his children. His children didnt deserve to live in the shadow of neglectful childhood. He had access to advisors, friends and his good ole teammate Sakura has a hospital dedicated to trauma. I don't think his inability to parent has to do with him being traumatized, I think Naruto literally just saw his own children like everyone else in the village: as his \"family\". Not as his offspring, but as another member of the community he has to keep safe because he is Hokage. It's also on Naruto for sending Sasuke on mission after mission outside of the village. Within the 11 years of sending Sasuke on missions, he never convinced the guy to come home. He let his best friend miss out on every milestone with Sarada. \n\nSasuke's family trauma makes sense: he did see everyone murdered.  But he also had an extreme love for his father as a child, and for Itachi, which he treasured, and instead of passing the sentiment to Sarada, he just left Sakura to provide all the love. From my understanding, everyone from OG Naruto had kids around 19 years of age. That is really young, and not really enough time for Sasuke to get past his extreme trauma. BUT, again, Sasuke has the ability to teleport, and he NEVER visited. And then when he showed up, he became this bumbling awkward father who doesn't seem to have much trauma related to child rearing. There are no signs of PTSD. He's just awkward. It looks to me like he just went out for a pack of smokes and ran away for 11 years. \n\nEither it's poor character development, or, in my opinion, these two just suck as parents.",

Shikamaru is worried his son is going to die, and Naruto is asking him to stay calm and be polite to the culprit instead of getting someone else from ANBU to stand in there.  \n\nShikamaru should not be in that room, but he is because Naruto is allowing it.

And it's true, their children do like them, as all children inexplicably love their parents, even when their parents are assholes.\n\nBut as an adult, looking on the actions of these other adults, they're kind of irredeemable as parents. Naruto had Hinata, and if Hinata is the tough, loving parent she is made out to be, I'm sure Hinata would have said something to Naruto about how much the children want him around. I get that he was an orphan and may have felt that Hinata's presence was enough for the kids, but it doesn't change the fact that he was extremely neglectful, for years. Its on him for prioritizing a village over his children. His children didnt deserve to live in the shadow of neglectful childhood. He had access to advisors, friends and his good ole teammate Sakura has a hospital dedicated to trauma. I don't think his inability to parent has to do with him being traumatized, I think Naruto literally just saw his own children like everyone else in the village: as his \"family\". Not as his offspring, but as another member of the community he has to keep safe because he is Hokage. It's also on Naruto for sending Sasuke on mission after mission outside of the village. Within the 11 years of sending Sasuke on missions, he never convinced the guy to come home. He let his best friend miss out on every milestone with Sarada. \n\nSasuke's family trauma makes sense: he did see everyone murdered.  But he also had an extreme love for his father as a child, and for Itachi, which he treasured, and instead of passing the sentiment to Sarada, he just left Sakura to provide all the love. From my understanding, everyone from OG Naruto had kids around 19 years of age. That is really young, and not really enough time for Sasuke to get past his extreme trauma. BUT, again, Sasuke has the ability to teleport, and he NEVER visited. And then when he showed up, he became this bumbling awkward father who doesn't seem to have much trauma related to child rearing. There are no signs of PTSD. He's just awkward. It looks to me like he just went out for a pack of smokes and ran away for 11 years. \n\nEither it's poor character development, or, in my opinion, these two just suck as parents.",

He is asking Shikamaru to keep it together and interview the guy, as if Shikamaru is the only person available to do this interview. That's totally messed up. Shikamaru is worried his son is going to die, and Naruto is asking him to stay calm and be polite to the culprit instead of getting someone else from ANBU to stand in there.  \n\nShikamaru should not be in that room, but he is because Naruto is allowing it.

And it's true, their children do like them, as all children inexplicably love their parents, even when their parents are assholes.\n\nBut as an adult, looking on the actions of these other adults, they're kind of irredeemable as parents. Naruto had Hinata, and if Hinata is the tough, loving parent she is made out to be, I'm sure Hinata would have said something to Naruto about how much the children want him around. I get that he was an orphan and may have felt that Hinata's presence was enough for the kids, but it doesn't change the fact that he was extremely neglectful, for years. Its on him for prioritizing a village over his children. His children didnt deserve to live in the shadow of neglectful childhood. He had access to advisors, friends and his good ole teammate Sakura has a hospital dedicated to trauma. I don't think his inability to parent has to do with him being traumatized, I think Naruto literally just saw his own children like everyone else in the village: as his \"family\". Not as his offspring, but as another member of the community he has to keep safe because he is Hokage. It's also on Naruto for sending Sasuke on mission after mission outside of the village. Within the 11 years of sending Sasuke on missions, he never convinced the guy to come home. He let his best friend miss out on every milestone with Sarada. \n\nSasuke's family trauma makes sense: he did see everyone murdered.  But he also had an extreme love for his father as a child, and for Itachi, which he treasured, and instead of passing the sentiment to Sarada, he just left Sakura to provide all the love. From my understanding, everyone from OG Naruto had kids around 19 years of age. That is really young, and not really enough time for Sasuke to get past his extreme trauma. BUT, again, Sasuke has the ability to teleport, and he NEVER visited. And then when he showed up, he became this bumbling awkward father who doesn't seem to have much trauma related to child rearing. There are no signs of PTSD. He's just awkward. It looks to me like he just went out for a pack of smokes and ran away for 11 years. \n\nEither it's poor character development, or, in my opinion, these two just suck as parents.",

He is asking Shikamaru to keep it together and interview the guy, as if Shikamaru is the only person available to do this interview. That's totally messed up. Shikamaru is worried his son is going to die, and Naruto is asking him to stay calm and be polite to the culprit instead of getting someone else from ANBU to stand in there.  \n\nShikamaru should not be in that room, but he is because Naruto is allowing it. Shikamaru should be watching behind the glass. Even if Shikamaru wanted to be in there, that's borderline mental abuse. \n\nNaruto has zero awareness as a parent.",
