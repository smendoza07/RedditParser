    "body": "Since last week I saw all the common prejudices and generalizations about 'older SBs' again pass by and I really want to correct some misunderstandings about us and our sugar reality. I hope this might help discouraged 'older SB' lurkers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **We are 'jealous' to young SBs.** No we're not. SDs interested in young SBs are not interested in us, and we are not interested in them. So why should we be jealous? We are very happy in our own sugar niche.\n2. **It is harder for us to find an SD.** No it's not, quite a lot of SDs search for age appropriate mistresses, and there are not that many attractive 'older' SBs in the bowl. So the SB/SD ratio's in our niche are probably much more in our favour than they are for the millions of young SBs in the rest of the bowl.\n3.  **Most SDs are looking for young SBs.** Yes indeed, and we know that! But guess what? We don't care! Because we are not looking for those SDs. We are interested in the SDs who *DO* look for older SBs, and there are still plenty of them!\n4. **Less messages** Yes, we get less messages. But the ones we receive are usually high quality ones. So we are very happy to not have to wade through an exploding inbox full of scammers, toe dippers, attention seekers, pic collectors, PUA's, P&D and predators. They don't even try, because they know over the years we probably have developed a high BS radar, so they concentrate on young (and hopefully ) naive.\n5. **Only real old 'undesirable' SDs are interested**  Nope! At least 50% of messages we receive come from younger men with a hot older mistress Mrs.Robinson crush. All older SBs I know, and they are quite a few, have (had) younger SDs.\n6. **We are pro's.** Most older SBs I know only entered the bowl after marriage and divorce, so our presence in the bowl is not pers\u00e8 longer than those of young SBs. Our age says nothing about how long we sugar. I even dare to say that we usually are less in it for money because we usually have our lives in order and sugar for different reasons. Since we are not desperate for money, and there usually are no extreme age gaps either, our SDs can be quite assured we are with them because we genuinely want to.\n7. **And jaded?** Why would we be more jaded than the young crowd that has to fight their way through much more crap than we do? Since we are attracting a certain type of serious, high quality SDs who aim for LT SRs, I dare say that maybe we have less negative experiences in the bowl to get jaded about than a lot of young girls.\n8. **We have 'bagage'** If I read all the posts about 'cutting' and other mental problems here from young SBs, I think bagage is not strictly related to age. All ages carry their own bagage.\n9. **We want higher allowances.** That's often true, but usually not a problem for our SDs. We attract mostly married and very successful business owners or CEO's who can afford us.\n10. **We want to turn our SRs into vanilla** No thanks! Most of us *don't* want a second husband and *that's* exactly why we are in the bowl!\n11. **We can be \"dated for free\" because of our age.** LOL nope. SDs  search to date out of their league, being it age-, looks-, emotional-, mental-, available- or otherwise. There is a myriad of reasons why they give allowances for compensation, and only one of them is age. An attractive older woman is absolutely out of the 'free' league of a married middle aged man who would like to keep that status. Just ask Jeff Bezos how 'free' his dating was. lol\n\nI hope this helps for better understanding of our reality in the bowl, because our SDs are not often to be found on sugar forums or blogs (they are just not that demographic) so their voices are seldom heard. Most comments come from SDs who are *NOT* into us and who project their own preferences on all other males, thus don't have the slightest clue but still feel entitled to spread their misinformation.",

Their free time is too precious and they are not interested enough to spend it on sugar subs.\n\nSugar for them is not a lifestyle but a means to an end. When it is time to search they make a profile on SA, once they have found their match they disappear again from the bowl for years.\n\nNow I know this isn't 100% accurate, as we can also see in some comments.

Go to interracial subreddits, you get racism. Go to any gaming subreddits, you get misogyny \u2014actually, go on any subreddit on Reddit. These comments ALWAYS get downvoted. Meaning that majority of people seeing the comment disagree with it (even though it\u2019s not how the up/downvote button should be used). Therefore the amount of upvotes and downvotes of certain posts in a subreddit reflect the mentality of most posters in that subreddit. Those comments you referred to ALWAYS get downvoted, and whoever makes those comments gets responses from at least 2 SBs who disagree with him. On the flipside, (and this was noticed by a mod here), any SD here who has a preference for young SBs gets vitriol, vitriol that actually gets upvoted. If you were able to show me any comment made against older SBs (or was stating a preference towards younger ones) that gained support I would agree with you, but there is none on this subreddit. So clearly, it\u2019s pro older SBs and a few shitty comments from some shitty posters doesn\u2019t change that, since it doesn\u2019t reflect the mentality of most posters on SLF.\n\nI honestly really like you as a poster and usually agree with whatever you say but I greatly disagree with this. Even going through your post history I don\u2019t see any majorly downvoted comment which supports your rhetoric. Perhaps it\u2019s best if we agree to disagree.\n\nEdit: yup, look, I got downvoted and I literally even said I agreed with you!",

Let's take the \"can be dated for free\" comment.    Do you honestly think no older SBs ever vanilla date?   As you say, SDs search for SBs who are out of their league.   Of course a \"married middle aged man who would like to keep that status\" can't vanilla date them, but, again, you're being disingenuous if you want to pretend that all older SBs are never going to go on a vanilla date again.\n\nI am not going to go line by line and point out every single place where you make a generalization, but you're talking only about a very specific subset of older SBs.",

Such claims would be obviously false and laughable.  However you *did* generalize.

Go to any gaming subreddits, you get misogyny \u2014actually, go on any subreddit on Reddit. These comments ALWAYS get downvoted. Meaning that majority of people seeing the comment disagree with it (even though it\u2019s not how the up/downvote button should be used). Therefore the amount of upvotes and downvotes of certain posts in a subreddit reflect the mentality of most posters in that subreddit. Those comments you referred to ALWAYS get downvoted, and whoever makes those comments gets responses from at least 2 SBs who disagree with him. On the flipside, (and this was noticed by a mod here), any SD here who has a preference for young SBs gets vitriol, vitriol that actually gets upvoted. If you were able to show me any comment made against older SBs (or was stating a preference towards younger ones) that gained support I would agree with you, but there is none on this subreddit. So clearly, it\u2019s pro older SBs and a few shitty comments from some shitty posters doesn\u2019t change that, since it doesn\u2019t reflect the mentality of most posters on SLF.\n\nI honestly really like you as a poster and usually agree with whatever you say but I greatly disagree with this. Even going through your post history I don\u2019t see any majorly downvoted comment which supports your rhetoric. Perhaps it\u2019s best if we agree to disagree.\n\nEdit: yup, look, I got downvoted and I literally even said I agreed with you!",

My post was not judgemental about something being ok or not, it was to contradict the (false) images about older SBs and their reality in the bowl. :)",

Let's take the \"can be dated for free\" comment.    Do you honestly think no older SBs ever vanilla date?   As you say, SDs search for SBs who are out of their league.   Of course a \"married middle aged man who would like to keep that status\" can't vanilla date them, but, again, you're being disingenuous if you want to pretend that all older SBs are never going to go on a vanilla date again.\n\nI am not going to go line by line and point out every single place where you make a generalization, but you're talking only about a very specific subset of older SBs.",

Meaning that majority of people seeing the comment disagree with it (even though it\u2019s not how the up/downvote button should be used). Therefore the amount of upvotes and downvotes of certain posts in a subreddit reflect the mentality of most posters in that subreddit. Those comments you referred to ALWAYS get downvoted, and whoever makes those comments gets responses from at least 2 SBs who disagree with him. On the flipside, (and this was noticed by a mod here), any SD here who has a preference for young SBs gets vitriol, vitriol that actually gets upvoted. If you were able to show me any comment made against older SBs (or was stating a preference towards younger ones) that gained support I would agree with you, but there is none on this subreddit. So clearly, it\u2019s pro older SBs and a few shitty comments from some shitty posters doesn\u2019t change that, since it doesn\u2019t reflect the mentality of most posters on SLF.\n\nI honestly really like you as a poster and usually agree with whatever you say but I greatly disagree with this. Even going through your post history I don\u2019t see any majorly downvoted comment which supports your rhetoric. Perhaps it\u2019s best if we agree to disagree.\n\nEdit: yup, look, I got downvoted and I literally even said I agreed with you!",

Meaning that majority of people seeing the comment disagree with it (even though it\u2019s not how the up/downvote button should be used). Therefore the amount of upvotes and downvotes of certain posts in a subreddit reflect the mentality of most posters in that subreddit. Those comments you referred to ALWAYS get downvoted, and whoever makes those comments gets responses from at least 2 SBs who disagree with him. On the flipside, (and this was noticed by a mod here), any SD here who has a preference for young SBs gets vitriol, vitriol that actually gets upvoted. If you were able to show me any comment made against older SBs (or was stating a preference towards younger ones) that gained support I would agree with you, but there is none on this subreddit. So clearly, it\u2019s pro older SBs and a few shitty comments from some shitty posters doesn\u2019t change that, since it doesn\u2019t reflect the mentality of most posters on SLF.\n\nI honestly really like you as a poster and usually agree with whatever you say but I greatly disagree with this.

Go to any gaming subreddits, you get misogyny \u2014actually, go on any subreddit on Reddit. These comments ALWAYS get downvoted. Meaning that majority of people seeing the comment disagree with it (even though it\u2019s not how the up/downvote button should be used). Therefore the amount of upvotes and downvotes of certain posts in a subreddit reflect the mentality of most posters in that subreddit. Those comments you referred to ALWAYS get downvoted, and whoever makes those comments gets responses from at least 2 SBs who disagree with him. On the flipside, (and this was noticed by a mod here), any SD here who has a preference for young SBs gets vitriol, vitriol that actually gets upvoted. If you were able to show me any comment made against older SBs (or was stating a preference towards younger ones) that gained support I would agree with you, but there is none on this subreddit. So clearly, it\u2019s pro older SBs and a few shitty comments from some shitty posters doesn\u2019t change that, since it doesn\u2019t reflect the mentality of most posters on SLF.\n\nI honestly really like you as a poster and usually agree with whatever you say but I greatly disagree with this. Even going through your post history I don\u2019t see any majorly downvoted comment which supports your rhetoric. Perhaps it\u2019s best if we agree to disagree.\n\nEdit: yup, look, I got downvoted and I literally even said I agreed with you!",
