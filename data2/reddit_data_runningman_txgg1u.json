A separate, new RM sub-reddit post about a separate, new instagram post isn't the same post as the previous one and so doesn't violate rules 6 or 7. \n\nIf someone posts the same link to an instagram post that's already been posted, then it would break the rules, so please report. Again, each of these posts have all been made each out of new instagram posts, so they're perfectly allowed. Maybe let's all be happy she's being active on instagram?",
