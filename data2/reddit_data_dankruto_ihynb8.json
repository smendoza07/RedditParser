He couldn\u2019t win because he couldn\u2019t hit hard enough, but the sand couldn\u2019t defend against shadow possession, and would actually make Gaara\u2019s shadow even easier to reach. If Gaara could still control the sand for offense while immobilized (it defends naturally, but doesn\u2019t attack) Shika would be screwed, but he might not be able to. In order to use sand coffin Gaara closes his fist, I\u2019d assume there are other small twitches necessary to use it offensively. Even if not, Shikamaru could possess him from outside his line of vision.\n\nKinda scary thinking about it though, two of the Genin in the exam basically could not be defeated at all except by each other lol. Sucks to be matched against Gaara or Naruto. Who the fuck looked at the roster and thought \u201ctwo jinchuriki, this\u2019ll be fine\u201d ?",

IMO Lee *has* to 100-0 Naruto, or he loses.\n\nThe fight opens and Lee is probably kicking Naruto around the block. Naruto probably seeps Kurama chakra in some form and if, after that, he starts to put some fight back up, Guy gives Lee weight drop clearance. \n\nNow Lee goes ham, but not whole hog (gates). If this were actually happening as their prelims match, soon after the weight drop is probably where Kakashi would step in, because with how strong Lee is sans weights, Naruto would probably be pushed past \u201ccloak\u201d form and into 4 tails. \n\nLee hits hard, but I don\u2019t know if he hits hard enough to 100-0 a cloak-form Naruto, and that\u2019s the question. Cloak form gives regen, but it also gives flat resistance as shown in the ninja war arc. Unless he\u2019s able to 100-0 knockout Naruto while Naruto only has 1-3 tails, Naruto will literally just keep slipping tails until even the Jonin would have trouble with him.\n\nBasically I think that, because Lee has (admirable) restrictions placed on him from the start of the fight, he\u2019d actually end up screwing himself, because if he doesn\u2019t go all-out early on he\u2019ll unintentionally scale Naruto to a point where he can\u2019t beat him.\n\n\nEDIT: TLDR: they both have restrictions and increasing-power type abilities, but I think Naruto\u2019s power ceiling is higher (imagine 8-tails), so Lee would have to open the gates early and shut him down, and seeing as how they are a forbidden last resort I don\u2019t think he\u2019d use them early enough to win.",

He couldn\u2019t win because he couldn\u2019t hit hard enough, but the sand couldn\u2019t defend against shadow possession, and would actually make Gaara\u2019s shadow even easier to reach. If Gaara could still control the sand for offense while immobilized (it defends naturally, but doesn\u2019t attack) Shika would be screwed, but he might not be able to. In order to use sand coffin Gaara closes his fist, I\u2019d assume there are other small twitches necessary to use it offensively. Even if not, Shikamaru could possess him from outside his line of vision.\n\nKinda scary thinking about it though, two of the Genin in the exam basically could not be defeated at all except by each other lol. Sucks to be matched against Gaara or Naruto. Who the fuck looked at the roster and thought \u201ctwo jinchuriki, this\u2019ll be fine\u201d ?",

            "body": "That\u2019s fair. \n\nI like this discussion though so I\u2019ll argue for Naruto.\n\nI\u2019d say it kind of depends on who goes all out first, and by all out I really mean ALL. IMO Lee *has* to 100-0 Naruto, or he loses.\n\nThe fight opens and Lee is probably kicking Naruto around the block. Naruto probably seeps Kurama chakra in some form and if, after that, he starts to put some fight back up, Guy gives Lee weight drop clearance. \n\nNow Lee goes ham, but not whole hog (gates). If this were actually happening as their prelims match, soon after the weight drop is probably where Kakashi would step in, because with how strong Lee is sans weights, Naruto would probably be pushed past \u201ccloak\u201d form and into 4 tails. \n\nLee hits hard, but I don\u2019t know if he hits hard enough to 100-0 a cloak-form Naruto, and that\u2019s the question. Cloak form gives regen, but it also gives flat resistance as shown in the ninja war arc. Unless he\u2019s able to 100-0 knockout Naruto while Naruto only has 1-3 tails, Naruto will literally just keep slipping tails until even the Jonin would have trouble with him.\n\nBasically I think that, because Lee has (admirable) restrictions placed on him from the start of the fight, he\u2019d actually end up screwing himself, because if he doesn\u2019t go all-out early on he\u2019ll unintentionally scale Naruto to a point where he can\u2019t beat him.\n\n\nEDIT: TLDR: they both have restrictions and increasing-power type abilities, but I think Naruto\u2019s power ceiling is higher (imagine 8-tails), so Lee would have to open the gates early and shut him down, and seeing as how they are a forbidden last resort I don\u2019t think he\u2019d use them early enough to win.",
