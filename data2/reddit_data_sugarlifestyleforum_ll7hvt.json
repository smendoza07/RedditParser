    "body": "Met a great (26f) SB 3 months ago that was recently divorced from a physically and emotionally abusive husband. She is a single mom of 2 toddlers and it was so obvious that she had been in an a abusive marriage. Fast forward we have had 3 great months. All things are positive. She is amazed at how a man can treat a woman when they have the woman\u2019s interest to heart. Suddenly today the the ex husband shows up at SB\u2019s parents house with screenshots of her SA profile that hasn\u2019t been accessed since December. Parents go nuts. Huge blow up about how she has embarrassed the family. So get a text telling me she can\u2019t keep seeing me. Can\u2019t disappoint the parents and that ex-husband has said he is going to destroy her and embarrass her with the info. Needless to say everyone seems to skip the fact that the ex would have to also be on SA to find the profile.   So is there a SD mafia I can contact to send the ex a message??? This is a huge loss she was spectacular.",

Either he is in a position to be getting a SB and he should just mind his own damn business, or he is not in the position to get a SB and he is leading women on or just stalking. \n\nIn this day and age I don't really think having an online profile on any kind of dating website is embarrassing. Just shows you are an adult with a personal life.",

I was raised Catholic and went to a Catholic school, and was initially taught (at school, not necessarily by mom) that birth control, premarital sex, abortion, masturbation and being gay were all sins. Then, I decided not to get confirmed and switch to public school and junior high. All four of my younger siblings followed suit. Several of us came out as gay, I had a child out of wedlock at 18, and, well, you get the point. \n\nMom was forced to either get with the times or lose her close relationships with all five of her children. She made the right choice. By the time I told her that I was sugaring for the first time, nearly 10 years ago, I had told her much more shocking and potentially disappointing news several times over. \ud83d\ude02\n\nI\u2019m really sorry that you have to deal with that. Nobody deserves it. I got rid of almost all of my social media about a year ago, as well, for similar reasons. The only one I really have left is Twitter, which I rarely use and definitely doesn\u2019t have anything personal on it.",

All this really did was tell me that he\u2019s been stalking me online, but it didn\u2019t have the effect he was hoping it would because my whole family and my closest friends know I\u2019m on the website/know I sugar.

Several of us came out as gay, I had a child out of wedlock at 18, and, well, you get the point. \n\nMom was forced to either get with the times or lose her close relationships with all five of her children.

The sugar world is a world that many look down on and can have real consequences if discovered you are in (not just by wives, but work, friends and family). No one should be entering into this lifestyle without thinking about the consequences to them if exposed, and what they are going to do in advance if someone exposes them (what is the plan to mitigate the risk of exposure). Seems like she didn\u2019t think of any of that. \n\nNow with you being the experienced SD, did you coach here through this thought process? And if not, do you think it is worth while to start doing that in the future?",
