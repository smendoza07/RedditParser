    "body": "This is a 100% true story from last night. \n\nI have posted before about my affection for the dinner date M&G. Sure, many don't work out, but worst case I get to try a new restaurant and meet a new person.\n\nWell.\n\nI recently connected with a fun new POT. Great messaging banter. Fun and easy. We smoothly coordinate a date within a few days. Everything we hope for in a new connection.\n\nShe's a great conversationalist over dinner. Fun storyteller. Seems to be genuinely interested in my last business, which combines with my ego and a first-date-appropriate amount of alcohol to make me feel like a million bucks. (After taxes.) Looking back, the one flag should have been that she's not so nice to the staff. I make excuses in my head and overtip.\n\nI invite her back to my place and she accepts. (Yes, I discuss terms before the date and have the PPM ready. If the date goes well I sometimes invite back. Don't @ me.)\n\nWithin five minutes of preparing drinks and settling on the couch, she mentions our new president's negotiations with the Galactic Federation.\n\nI smoothly stifle a spit take. I'm sorry, the Galactic What?! Did I miss the conversational transition to Star Trek episodes? \n\nReader, I did not. She's pulling up conspiracy theory websites on her phone and showing them to me. Quickly, like she does this a lot. Does she have these pages bookmarked? I try to laugh and move the conversation along. I mistakenly make a light joke that this sounds like the fake moon landing theories. Boy does she have a lot to say on that topic. I carefully move my arm from behind her shoulders to my lap.\n\nFast forward a few minutes and she's telling me she's clairaudient. I think I remember this term from fantasy novels but I can't be sure, so I ask for clarification. She hears voices. Specific voices. They have names. They tell her what to do and what not to do. One of them dictated her novel to her.\n\nSo now I am thinking: Maybe SLF was right all this time! Would a daytime coffee M&G have sussed this out without her being in my house after sundown? Am I finally getting my comeuppance? How will I even extricate myself from this situation?\n\nWell, dear readers, eventually a conversational pause presented itself like an oasis in the desert. I awkwardly suggest that maybe an arrangement is not for us and it's getting late. Mercifully, this goes smoothly. I walk her to her car. As of this morning, no complications or collateral damage. Except perhaps my relationship with the staff at a hip new restaurant that I wouldn't mind returning to.\n\nSo, trusted SLF community: I have a few more M&Gs coming up. Should I stick to my guns and continue the dinner dates? Transition to boring but risk-minimizing coffees? What say you?",

No?",

It\u2019s like an old school relationship with a little taboo and age gap, plus no pressure for marriage/kids. \n\nKeep it moving, be active, see what she is like in different enviros and with different kinds of strangers. \n\nAlso - the rude to the wait staff bit - omg! That is such a turn off, huge red flag, and also wtf is rude to those who work to make money from trying to help people (service industry)? If she is unkind to strangers she isn\u2019t capable of being kind to close ones, IMO. Very tack and tale telling. \n\nThere are plenty of pretty AND nice girls for someone like you, OP, who seems genuine and kind. Next that hoe and find you a nice girl. \n\nGood luck x",

It\u2019s like an old school relationship with a little taboo and age gap, plus no pressure for marriage/kids. \n\nKeep it moving, be active, see what she is like in different enviros and with different kinds of strangers. \n\nAlso - the rude to the wait staff bit - omg! That is such a turn off, huge red flag, and also wtf is rude to those who work to make money from trying to help people (service industry)? If she is unkind to strangers she isn\u2019t capable of being kind to close ones, IMO. Very tack and tale telling. \n\nThere are plenty of pretty AND nice girls for someone like you, OP, who seems genuine and kind. Next that hoe and find you a nice girl. \n\nGood luck x",
