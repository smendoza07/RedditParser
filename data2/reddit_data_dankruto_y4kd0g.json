It makes it nearly unwatchable especially on a rewatch. Naruto would do incredibly well with a FMA: Brotherhood treatment, where they trim all the fat and just leave all the juicy meaty bits.",

Man there are avid readers of one piece who hate one piece, I think r/piratefolk is one of the subreddits that is the best example of that. I don\u2019t really get the idea of my anime is better and yours sucks so you shouldn\u2019t enjoy it. Like whatever you want man. Gives me real HoTD vs RoP vibes.",
