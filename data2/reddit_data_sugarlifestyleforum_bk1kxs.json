    "body": "...or, in the man's case, about offering money. I think there is one fundamental skill that some posters here lack, and it is this:\n\n* Be able to hear NO without having an ego reaction.\n\nIf you are rejected, all it means is that you are incompatible with someone. It does not make you ugly, unlovable, less of a woman or a man, or anything else. It's just a fact about expectations of two people not matching. Salespeople usually develop this skill to a high level, because you have 99 people tell you no, and you have to talk to person 100 as though he's the first person you've spoken to today. But non-sales people, especially \"sweet introverts,\" can take a NO as though it means they are horrible and their life is over. Well, get over it. Whatever you need to make that happen, get over it.\n\nWomen are afraid to ask for money because what if it spoils the date. Men are afraid to offer money, even if they have it, because if she says she wants more, it means that he is too ugly and worthless to get a date even if he pays for it.  Well, all y'all need to toughen up. Ask for something you'd be happy giving or receiving. You can always negotiate after you ask. But if you don't ask at all, it's your own damn fault if nobody ever deals with the topic ever.\n\nNOT GOOD ENOUGH:\n\n1. I would like to spoil you.\n2. I would like an allowance.\n\nGOOD ENOUGH:\n\n1. How about $X per meeting or per month, provided in Y way?\n\nDo not allow wiggle room. Be specific and clear. It is perfectly fine to be disappointed if the other person says no. But if you feel a stronger emotion, you probably need to work on that. You are reacting to something that is more than the actual situation.\n\nWHEN TO ASK:\n\nI have a preference, but other people here, whose posts seem real -- but of course none of us here can verify anything -- have very different preferences about this. So I don't want to give some how-to guide. There is no bible, and no Sugar Oracle. Your approach might be totally different from mine. But whatever you do, chill out and think like a business person, especially when it comes to asking for money.\n\nThank you for reading my rant.",

But finding an SD you actually enjoy (I'm presuming you're an SB based on your username), can be a struggle. But, generally speaking, if you ask for more in an established arrangement, you risk losing the arrangement altogether. If you're fine with that, you just need to not tie his ability/desire to spend more on an arrangement to who you are as a person. For most SDs most of the time, our allowance is determined more by what is going on inside of us than any particular attribute(s) of the SB. You shouldn't think it is about you because, usually, it isn't.",

They either say my last SD gave me this, or without any provocation just offer up the amount they're looking for per date, even before moving to text. This is one of the reasons I've been able to go on so meet and greets without discussing allowance in advance. Because 99% of the time the ones that will meet you without discussing money are either reasonable with what they want (meaning close the the area average), or they are willing to accept your offer if they have no idea what's an acceptable amount.  Only once did I meet someone whose monthly was way out of line with what I was willing to give. She was a good negotiator, and even offered to see me 4 additional times per month to get that amount. Other then that, every POT that I met, that made it past the meet and greet into a 2nd date, all ended up agreeing, what I was willing to offer.",

These normal guys might stay in 5 star hotels, but they aren\u2019t flying us first class or getting invited to the hottest events, so you\u2019re right about that. It\u2019s a big reason why I\u2019ve been single for yearssss. I don\u2019t want to feel bad or guilty for living my life and doing these things without him, so I never cared to get serious.\n\nBut an experience daddy?! You\u2019ve got to be kidding me... If by experience you mean he\u2019s done this before and it\u2019s your first time then yeah lol. Ask yourself, what would be the difference for him between an \u201cexperience\u201d baby and a girl he is a vanilla dating? Without the allowance, there is no difference!!! He would still be flying her first class and taking her to events as his date... just like he would with any vanilla girlfriend. Y\u2019all are being manipulated and you don\u2019t even realize it. If you want to get invited to A-list events, yacht parties and private jets... then move to a large metropolitan city and network into these circles (usually models). If you\u2019re attractive and outgoing, you\u2019ll get invited. Sex isn\u2019t expected. They need us. You\u2019re just there to have fun and make them look good. \n\nMen who have access to these events and use that to bait you into sleeping with them are the worst. They are master manipulators. The more inexperienced, younger, and naive you are, the better. They know that lifestyle is enticing to new girls. At the end of the day, you\u2019re getting the short end of the stick because he\u2019s using these experiences as leverage for sugar. Which is worst than vanilla dating. At least with vanilla dating, he isn\u2019t doing things because he\u2019s expecting something in return. He\u2019s doing it because he wants to and not because he\u2019s going to use it against you later. \n\nEdit: Sorry thought you were a SB, so my post is written that way, but everything still applies",

Free sex without having to deal with the messy commitment parts of a relationship.\n\nYou don't have to be a destitute college student to appreciate money. A financially stable SB will put up with less BS because she's not broke or desperate, but it doesn't mean she can't use the money. She can always put the money into savings or a retirement fund or splurge on gifts for herself. If gifts and shopping are her compensation, then it seems like the \"experience SD\" is just a workaround for SD's with fragile egos",

But finding an SD you actually enjoy (I'm presuming you're an SB based on your username), can be a struggle. But, generally speaking, if you ask for more in an established arrangement, you risk losing the arrangement altogether. If you're fine with that, you just need to not tie his ability/desire to spend more on an arrangement to who you are as a person. For most SDs most of the time, our allowance is determined more by what is going on inside of us than any particular attribute(s) of the SB. You shouldn't think it is about you because, usually, it isn't.",

You might see it as an insult when really it's not. It's just what my budget is. I'm just barely rich but I have no family or obligations so I can afford to offer a competitive allowance.

They either say my last SD gave me this, or without any provocation just offer up the amount they're looking for per date, even before moving to text. This is one of the reasons I've been able to go on so meet and greets without discussing allowance in advance. Because 99% of the time the ones that will meet you without discussing money are either reasonable with what they want (meaning close the the area average), or they are willing to accept your offer if they have no idea what's an acceptable amount.  Only once did I meet someone whose monthly was way out of line with what I was willing to give. She was a good negotiator, and even offered to see me 4 additional times per month to get that amount. Other then that, every POT that I met, that made it past the meet and greet into a 2nd date, all ended up agreeing, what I was willing to offer.",

It\u2019s a big reason why I\u2019ve been single for yearssss. I don\u2019t want to feel bad or guilty for living my life and doing these things without him, so I never cared to get serious.\n\nBut an experience daddy?! You\u2019ve got to be kidding me... If by experience you mean he\u2019s done this before and it\u2019s your first time then yeah lol. Ask yourself, what would be the difference for him between an \u201cexperience\u201d baby and a girl he is a vanilla dating? Without the allowance, there is no difference!!! He would still be flying her first class and taking her to events as his date... just like he would with any vanilla girlfriend. Y\u2019all are being manipulated and you don\u2019t even realize it. If you want to get invited to A-list events, yacht parties and private jets... then move to a large metropolitan city and network into these circles (usually models). If you\u2019re attractive and outgoing, you\u2019ll get invited. Sex isn\u2019t expected. They need us. You\u2019re just there to have fun and make them look good. \n\nMen who have access to these events and use that to bait you into sleeping with them are the worst. They are master manipulators. The more inexperienced, younger, and naive you are, the better. They know that lifestyle is enticing to new girls. At the end of the day, you\u2019re getting the short end of the stick because he\u2019s using these experiences as leverage for sugar. Which is worst than vanilla dating. At least with vanilla dating, he isn\u2019t doing things because he\u2019s expecting something in return. He\u2019s doing it because he wants to and not because he\u2019s going to use it against you later. \n\nEdit: Sorry thought you were a SB, so my post is written that way, but everything still applies",

Free sex without having to deal with the messy commitment parts of a relationship.\n\nYou don't have to be a destitute college student to appreciate money. A financially stable SB will put up with less BS because she's not broke or desperate, but it doesn't mean she can't use the money. She can always put the money into savings or a retirement fund or splurge on gifts for herself. If gifts and shopping are her compensation, then it seems like the \"experience SD\" is just a workaround for SD's with fragile egos",

But, generally speaking, if you ask for more in an established arrangement, you risk losing the arrangement altogether. If you're fine with that, you just need to not tie his ability/desire to spend more on an arrangement to who you are as a person. For most SDs most of the time, our allowance is determined more by what is going on inside of us than any particular attribute(s) of the SB. You shouldn't think it is about you because, usually, it isn't.",

You might see it as an insult when really it's not. It's just what my budget is. I'm just barely rich but I have no family or obligations so I can afford to offer a competitive allowance.

Because 99% of the time the ones that will meet you without discussing money are either reasonable with what they want (meaning close the the area average), or they are willing to accept your offer if they have no idea what's an acceptable amount.  Only once did I meet someone whose monthly was way out of line with what I was willing to give. She was a good negotiator, and even offered to see me 4 additional times per month to get that amount.

If by experience you mean he\u2019s done this before and it\u2019s your first time then yeah lol. Ask yourself, what would be the difference for him between an \u201cexperience\u201d baby and a girl he is a vanilla dating? Without the allowance, there is no difference!!! He would still be flying her first class and taking her to events as his date... just like he would with any vanilla girlfriend. Y\u2019all are being manipulated and you don\u2019t even realize it. If you want to get invited to A-list events, yacht parties and private jets... then move to a large metropolitan city and network into these circles (usually models). If you\u2019re attractive and outgoing, you\u2019ll get invited. Sex isn\u2019t expected. They need us. You\u2019re just there to have fun and make them look good. \n\nMen who have access to these events and use that to bait you into sleeping with them are the worst. They are master manipulators. The more inexperienced, younger, and naive you are, the better. They know that lifestyle is enticing to new girls. At the end of the day, you\u2019re getting the short end of the stick because he\u2019s using these experiences as leverage for sugar. Which is worst than vanilla dating. At least with vanilla dating, he isn\u2019t doing things because he\u2019s expecting something in return. He\u2019s doing it because he wants to and not because he\u2019s going to use it against you later. \n\nEdit: Sorry thought you were a SB, so my post is written that way, but everything still applies",

The truth of the matter is not every SB is some destitute college woman. Some actually have good paying jobs and forego the allowance to experience things they can\u2019t afford or don\u2019t want to splurge on themselves. Typically experience daddies also give gifts and take them shopping too. Speaking from personal experience I\u2019ve been in a SR like this previously, as well as allowance based ones too.",

And how was being an experience SD any different than being a vanilla boyfriend, for you? Wouldn't you treat your girlfriend with experiences and gifts as well? Or does the sugar daddy title only depend on how desperate a woman is? Seems like you're just getting the best of both worlds. Free sex without having to deal with the messy commitment parts of a relationship.\n\nYou don't have to be a destitute college student to appreciate money. A financially stable SB will put up with less BS because she's not broke or desperate, but it doesn't mean she can't use the money. She can always put the money into savings or a retirement fund or splurge on gifts for herself. If gifts and shopping are her compensation, then it seems like the \"experience SD\" is just a workaround for SD's with fragile egos",

You might see it as an insult when really it's not. It's just what my budget is. I'm just barely rich but I have no family or obligations so I can afford to offer a competitive allowance.  But I do have a limit and I prefer the women know this upfront. \n\nActually, I understate what I'm offering by just a little bit. Then I up the offer to what it should be if the meet and greet goes well. That way I get to give a little flattery by telling them they're the best potential SB I've met and I'm willing to offer a little more.",

These normal guys might stay in 5 star hotels, but they aren\u2019t flying us first class or getting invited to the hottest events, so you\u2019re right about that. It\u2019s a big reason why I\u2019ve been single for yearssss. I don\u2019t want to feel bad or guilty for living my life and doing these things without him, so I never cared to get serious.\n\nBut an experience daddy?! You\u2019ve got to be kidding me... If by experience you mean he\u2019s done this before and it\u2019s your first time then yeah lol. Ask yourself, what would be the difference for him between an \u201cexperience\u201d baby and a girl he is a vanilla dating? Without the allowance, there is no difference!!! He would still be flying her first class and taking her to events as his date... just like he would with any vanilla girlfriend. Y\u2019all are being manipulated and you don\u2019t even realize it. If you want to get invited to A-list events, yacht parties and private jets... then move to a large metropolitan city and network into these circles (usually models). If you\u2019re attractive and outgoing, you\u2019ll get invited. Sex isn\u2019t expected. They need us. You\u2019re just there to have fun and make them look good. \n\nMen who have access to these events and use that to bait you into sleeping with them are the worst. They are master manipulators. The more inexperienced, younger, and naive you are, the better. They know that lifestyle is enticing to new girls. At the end of the day, you\u2019re getting the short end of the stick because he\u2019s using these experiences as leverage for sugar. Which is worst than vanilla dating. At least with vanilla dating, he isn\u2019t doing things because he\u2019s expecting something in return. He\u2019s doing it because he wants to and not because he\u2019s going to use it against you later. \n\nEdit: Sorry thought you were a SB, so my post is written that way, but everything still applies",

A financially stable SB will put up with less BS because she's not broke or desperate, but it doesn't mean she can't use the money. She can always put the money into savings or a retirement fund or splurge on gifts for herself. If gifts and shopping are her compensation, then it seems like the \"experience SD\" is just a workaround for SD's with fragile egos",

You might see it as an insult when really it's not. It's just what my budget is. I'm just barely rich but I have no family or obligations so I can afford to offer a competitive allowance.  But I do have a limit and I prefer the women know this upfront. \n\nActually, I understate what I'm offering by just a little bit. Then I up the offer to what it should be if the meet and greet goes well.
