And I\u2019m sure there are plenty of 4.0 \u2018ers that make terrific leaders.   I\u2019ve hired several that were, but I usually found out about their brilliant academic success after I hired them. \n\nThat\u2019s the difference. \n\nBut I\u2019ve also worked with dozens of Ivy League graduates that were horrible leaders and got their jobs on that basis alone. \n\nNo thanks",

If you like to work with your hands, be a builder. \n\nSome of the wealthiest people I know are successful entrepreneurs that never even went to college. \n\nIf you don\u2019t know what you want to do my suggestion is to just get a general business degree.  Go to a Junior college and then an in state school to keep the cost down.",

Context matters and is rarely conveyed accurately in a comment on Reddit.   \n\nPeople that value the top 1% more than the other 99% are typically insufferable hypocrites and make horrible leaders. \n\nIt\u2019s funny that stating my opinion is condescending just because it\u2019s different from yours. \n\nThe last company I ran was a top 50 healthcare IT company that had 10,000 employees in all 50 states, Canada & PR.  \n\nMy opinion comes from years of experience and my comments are meant to educate the younger people reading this sub, not you specifically. \n\nYou could be the absolute greatest person in the world and a terrific leader & mentor.  And I\u2019m sure there are plenty of 4.0 \u2018ers that make terrific leaders.   I\u2019ve hired several that were, but I usually found out about their brilliant academic success after I hired them. \n\nThat\u2019s the difference. \n\nBut I\u2019ve also worked with dozens of Ivy League graduates that were horrible leaders and got their jobs on that basis alone. \n\nNo thanks",

No thanks. \n\nThe worst were the IT people but the same with marketing, legal & finance.  \n\nI learned to just screen them out & move on. \n\nThe best leaders & performers tended to be college athletes and ex military so that was always a plus.",

I invested my own money along with theirs.  \n\nThe average returns for the four companies I ran were 7 to 1.  \n\nLeadership isn\u2019t learned in college these days and so many degrees aren\u2019t worth the paper they are written on. \n\nThe number of kids with $50-$100k of debt that are working at Starbucks & Home Depot is staggering. \n\nThis may be great for SDs but it\u2019s a horrible investment.  \n\nI encourage the people I teach and/or mentor these days to either get a practical degree or, in many cases, to skip college and focus on what they love to do instead. \n\nIf you love to work on cars, be a mechanic.  If you like to work with your hands, be a builder. \n\nSome of the wealthiest people I know are successful entrepreneurs that never even went to college. \n\nIf you don\u2019t know what you want to do my suggestion is to just get a general business degree.  Go to a Junior college and then an in state school to keep the cost down.",

And I\u2019m sure there are plenty of 4.0 \u2018ers that make terrific leaders.   I\u2019ve hired several that were, but I usually found out about their brilliant academic success after I hired them. \n\nThat\u2019s the difference. \n\nBut I\u2019ve also worked with dozens of Ivy League graduates that were horrible leaders and got their jobs on that basis alone. \n\nNo thanks",

If you like to work with your hands, be a builder. \n\nSome of the wealthiest people I know are successful entrepreneurs that never even went to college. \n\nIf you don\u2019t know what you want to do my suggestion is to just get a general business degree.  Go to a Junior college and then an in state school to keep the cost down.",

I invested my own money along with theirs.  \n\nThe average returns for the four companies I ran were 7 to 1.  \n\nLeadership isn\u2019t learned in college these days and so many degrees aren\u2019t worth the paper they are written on. \n\nThe number of kids with $50-$100k of debt that are working at Starbucks & Home Depot is staggering. \n\nThis may be great for SDs but it\u2019s a horrible investment.  \n\nI encourage the people I teach and/or mentor these days to either get a practical degree or, in many cases, to skip college and focus on what they love to do instead. \n\nIf you love to work on cars, be a mechanic.  If you like to work with your hands, be a builder. \n\nSome of the wealthiest people I know are successful entrepreneurs that never even went to college. \n\nIf you don\u2019t know what you want to do my suggestion is to just get a general business degree.  Go to a Junior college and then an in state school to keep the cost down.",
