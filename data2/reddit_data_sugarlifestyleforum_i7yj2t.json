    "body": "I just want to say thank you to the admin that has a pin at the top about scams. I literally needed to see that. Perfect timing. As a newbie I\u2019m still learning things and the conversation with this new guy seemed extremely fishy to the point I gave him a completely new email address I just made for this exact reason. He talked about how he was going through a divorce and couldn\u2019t send through Venmo or cashapp and that I would be emailed by his \u201cpayroll officer\u201d literally your entire post word for word. None of it made sense like how could you email a check but can\u2019t do a mobile deposit through Venmo or cashapp? Again just a big thank you for saving me from all of the future trouble!",
