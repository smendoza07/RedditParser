    "body": "I get a text and ignore it because I think it\u2019s a scam text. But then I take a second look at it and it says:\n\nHey Adira, Is that you? It's X. I have been looking for you, finally found your contact details on this website http://www.xxxxx.com/about\n\nNow he says my actual name and my website so I\u2019m a little bit freaked out as the only guy in my contacts with his name is an SD I saw twice in 2018 who then ghosted me and never paid my allowance. It was actually really upsetting being scammed.\n\nSo turns out it\u2019s that same guy.\n\nSo basically. \nI get scammed by an SD in 2018 (yes I know now, always get money upfront) but turns out he wasn\u2019t a scam artist after all. He was in an accident and lost his phone and then he tried to search for me but didn\u2019t know how to spell my name. Then recently (years later)he met a guy from my country who has a sister with the same name as me and he realized he had been searching the wrong name. He searched for me again and found my website and my contact details and texted me. \n\nHe\u2019s paid me what he owes me and apologized. I just don\u2019t even know what to say. So I\u2019m seeing him for a coffee to chat. \n\nI want to show you all our conversation because I find it so bizarre but I don\u2019t know how to attach photos. \n\nSo yeah I guess things aren\u2019t always what they seem.",

In fact, i was out the other day with an older guy, and i needed to pay him, and he was like, write me a check. And i said, i don't have those anymore, can i give you cash?\n\nWhat's so silly is that the checks have the bank account number and routing number.  But yea, when you're young, they tell you, never give your bank account number to anybody, so when somebody says, give me your account number for payment, immediately you know is a scam.  \n\nBut that's why you saw that person ask, \"and you gave your bank account?\" Is not something normal to do in the USA",

In fact, i was out the other day with an older guy, and i needed to pay him, and he was like, write me a check. And i said, i don't have those anymore, can i give you cash?\n\nWhat's so silly is that the checks have the bank account number and routing number.  But yea, when you're young, they tell you, never give your bank account number to anybody, so when somebody says, give me your account number for payment, immediately you know is a scam.  \n\nBut that's why you saw that person ask, \"and you gave your bank account?\" Is not something normal to do in the USA",
