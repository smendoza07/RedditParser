I took this I beleive from a youtube comment I saw but I forgot who said it. \n\nIf I was Kishi, i would have also not made the switch to Naruhina, and instead plan for an eventual complete unification of the Uchia and Uzumaki clan by having the final pairings being Sauske & Karin (if there is anyone who deserves a fairy tale happy ending it's her) and Naruto and Sakura. This way the next generation have large chakra reserves, better chakra control, and an affinity for sealing jutsu; thus being able to handle this new threat.",

The jinjhurki of the Shukaku being driven to madness and sevre insomnia, the 8 tails hosts dying like flies because they couldn't handle the power, and why the Uzumaki clan was specifically chosen by the Hidden Leaf to be the hosts of the nine tails, to the clan's immense reserves and ability to suppress tailed beasts.\n\nThe Shin arc was okay even if I was still mad about the ending of Naruto, but I just wished they made Karin, Sarada's mother they look so alike and even their personalities are similar. \n\nIt was alright but I would have preferred them sealing him away rather than killing because I hate that karma seal thing",

Shino almost never needs saving, is always calm, collected, stealthy, effective, and takes out his opponents before they realize they\u2019ve even lost. Shino is one of the only actual ninjas in the whole show. \n\nShino IS the boot.",

With the jutsu he had at the time, Sasuke has very limited options in terms of range, meaning he\u2019d have to get in close to Hidan. His best hope is to use Orochimaru\u2019s snakes to restrain Hidan, and that\u2019s assuming he figures out how Hidan\u2019s powers work before he gets cut (keep in mind, Hidan doesn\u2019t have to weave signs so the sharingan wouldn\u2019t be much help in that regard).\n\nAs for Gaara, I think Deidara vs Gaara was just a bad matchup for Gaara, not a testament to Deidara\u2019s strength. Deidara has abilities that are the perfect counter to Gaara\u2019s defenses, like drilling explosives.",

She dies, everyone dies, she doesn\u2019t die, world dies, but those deaths aren\u2019t on hinata. Her job was to not interfere and in her doing so, she would have killed the world. \n\nI\u2019ll gladly die on my hill that hinata is trash but that\u2019s not the point here. The point is that she didn\u2019t save Naruto. No one knew about him going ape shit or Minato but it\u2019s not like that was her plan. You give her too much credit. She couldn\u2019t have done anything except die before Naruto did and that\u2019s not helping.",

Keep in mind Pain was squaring off against the weird muscly Kurama until sage mode Naruto came back out, Pain could\u2019ve killed anyone except Naruto in the village, and almost did kill everyone, I\u2019m not trying to sound like a hinatard, but she deserves more credit than your trying to give her, especially considering there\u2019s not many instances op could\u2019ve put there",

But after his fight against Kankuro, he was nowhere to be seen for the rest of the series. \n\nEven worse was that Kishimoto didn't even bother including him in the Sasuke Retrieval Mission either, despite the fact that his abilities would've been crucial for retrieving Sasuke and he would've handled the Sound 4 fights a lot better than the rest of the squad. I wish we got to see Shino fight Kidomaru and Neji fights Kimimaro and Lee saving him.",

I took this I beleive from a youtube comment I saw but I forgot who said it. \n\nIf I was Kishi, i would have also not made the switch to Naruhina, and instead plan for an eventual complete unification of the Uchia and Uzumaki clan by having the final pairings being Sauske & Karin (if there is anyone who deserves a fairy tale happy ending it's her) and Naruto and Sakura. This way the next generation have large chakra reserves, better chakra control, and an affinity for sealing jutsu; thus being able to handle this new threat.",

Shino almost never needs saving, is always calm, collected, stealthy, effective, and takes out his opponents before they realize they\u2019ve even lost. Shino is one of the only actual ninjas in the whole show. \n\nShino IS the boot.",

With the jutsu he had at the time, Sasuke has very limited options in terms of range, meaning he\u2019d have to get in close to Hidan. His best hope is to use Orochimaru\u2019s snakes to restrain Hidan, and that\u2019s assuming he figures out how Hidan\u2019s powers work before he gets cut (keep in mind, Hidan doesn\u2019t have to weave signs so the sharingan wouldn\u2019t be much help in that regard).\n\nAs for Gaara, I think Deidara vs Gaara was just a bad matchup for Gaara, not a testament to Deidara\u2019s strength. Deidara has abilities that are the perfect counter to Gaara\u2019s defenses, like drilling explosives.",

Keep in mind Pain was squaring off against the weird muscly Kurama until sage mode Naruto came back out, Pain could\u2019ve killed anyone except Naruto in the village, and almost did kill everyone, I\u2019m not trying to sound like a hinatard, but she deserves more credit than your trying to give her, especially considering there\u2019s not many instances op could\u2019ve put there",

He tied with the same Kankuro who killed the strongest sound 4 with ease and became a jonin and the Kazekage's bodyguard. Also, he was the closest person to injuring Obito during the Itachi Pursuit Mission and hadn't Obito not had the most broken ability he wouldve been done for. \n\nKeep in mind, Shino was the first person Naruto thought of for the Sasuke Retrieval Team when they needed strong ninjas. Sasuke (the dude who always looks down upon his peers) trusted Shino to handle Kankuro and wasn't even being bossy towards him. Indicating that he has some respect for him unlike the rest of the rookies.",

He fought a much weaker Kankuro and he kind of countered Kankuro. And Naruto thought of Shino because he didn't want Kiba. If Naruto wanted a strong ninja, he should have gone for Neji. And Sasuke left Kankuro for Shino since he looked down on Kankuro too. Kankuro wasn't that strong back then. And Obito would have 0-diffed Shinos bugs but he was playing around. He could have used a basic fire style jutsu, and his bugs are dead.",

I took this I beleive from a youtube comment I saw but I forgot who said it. \n\nIf I was Kishi, i would have also not made the switch to Naruhina, and instead plan for an eventual complete unification of the Uchia and Uzumaki clan by having the final pairings being Sauske & Karin (if there is anyone who deserves a fairy tale happy ending it's her) and Naruto and Sakura. This way the next generation have large chakra reserves, better chakra control, and an affinity for sealing jutsu; thus being able to handle this new threat.",

The jinjhurki of the Shukaku being driven to madness and sevre insomnia, the 8 tails hosts dying like flies because they couldn't handle the power, and why the Uzumaki clan was specifically chosen by the Hidden Leaf to be the hosts of the nine tails, to the clan's immense reserves and ability to suppress tailed beasts.\n\nThe Shin arc was okay even if I was still mad about the ending of Naruto, but I just wished they made Karin, Sarada's mother they look so alike and even their personalities are similar. \n\nIt was alright but I would have preferred them sealing him away rather than killing because I hate that karma seal thing",

His best hope is to use Orochimaru\u2019s snakes to restrain Hidan, and that\u2019s assuming he figures out how Hidan\u2019s powers work before he gets cut (keep in mind, Hidan doesn\u2019t have to weave signs so the sharingan wouldn\u2019t be much help in that regard).\n\nAs for Gaara, I think Deidara vs Gaara was just a bad matchup for Gaara, not a testament to Deidara\u2019s strength.

I took this I beleive from a youtube comment I saw but I forgot who said it. \n\nIf I was Kishi, i would have also not made the switch to Naruhina, and instead plan for an eventual complete unification of the Uchia and Uzumaki clan by having the final pairings being Sauske & Karin (if there is anyone who deserves a fairy tale happy ending it's her) and Naruto and Sakura. This way the next generation have large chakra reserves, better chakra control, and an affinity for sealing jutsu; thus being able to handle this new threat.",

It's actually an Otsutsuki possessing a human body. But yes, Boruto has potential, theybjust want to make it a wad of bullshit. \n\nThe only part of Boruto hitting back at you was Naruto smiling at Boruto when Momoshiki attacked and the fight scene with Momoshiki.

The jinjhurki of the Shukaku being driven to madness and sevre insomnia, the 8 tails hosts dying like flies because they couldn't handle the power, and why the Uzumaki clan was specifically chosen by the Hidden Leaf to be the hosts of the nine tails, to the clan's immense reserves and ability to suppress tailed beasts.\n\nThe Shin arc was okay even if I was still mad about the ending of Naruto, but I just wished they made Karin, Sarada's mother they look so alike and even their personalities are similar. \n\nIt was alright but I would have preferred them sealing him away rather than killing because I hate that karma seal thing",

Although I would agree that Karin deserved more, the way she has been treated.\n\nBut it's not human characters who are stronger than Naruto or Sasuke. It's actually an Otsutsuki possessing a human body. But yes, Boruto has potential, theybjust want to make it a wad of bullshit. \n\nThe only part of Boruto hitting back at you was Naruto smiling at Boruto when Momoshiki attacked and the fight scene with Momoshiki. That's the end ig. Or maybe the Shin arc. Even that was decently well made.",

The jinjhurki of the Shukaku being driven to madness and sevre insomnia, the 8 tails hosts dying like flies because they couldn't handle the power, and why the Uzumaki clan was specifically chosen by the Hidden Leaf to be the hosts of the nine tails, to the clan's immense reserves and ability to suppress tailed beasts.\n\nThe Shin arc was okay even if I was still mad about the ending of Naruto, but I just wished they made Karin, Sarada's mother they look so alike and even their personalities are similar. \n\nIt was alright but I would have preferred them sealing him away rather than killing because I hate that karma seal thing",

With the jutsu he had at the time, Sasuke has very limited options in terms of range, meaning he\u2019d have to get in close to Hidan. His best hope is to use Orochimaru\u2019s snakes to restrain Hidan, and that\u2019s assuming he figures out how Hidan\u2019s powers work before he gets cut (keep in mind, Hidan doesn\u2019t have to weave signs so the sharingan wouldn\u2019t be much help in that regard).\n\nAs for Gaara, I think Deidara vs Gaara was just a bad matchup for Gaara, not a testament to Deidara\u2019s strength. Deidara has abilities that are the perfect counter to Gaara\u2019s defenses, like drilling explosives.",

I just stated he cares for everyone, anyone at that point would have resolved the issue. Also shut up, their relationship was not developed in any way. \n\nNo, plot armor is a given, the show couldn\u2019t kill Naruto but if it had, it was hinata\u2019s fault. That\u2019s essentially what I\u2019ve been trying to say but you\u2019re making it seem likes she\u2019s a fucking hero for jumping in. And again her jumping in changes nothing. She dies, everyone dies, she doesn\u2019t die, world dies, but those deaths aren\u2019t on hinata. Her job was to not interfere and in her doing so, she would have killed the world. \n\nI\u2019ll gladly die on my hill that hinata is trash but that\u2019s not the point here. The point is that she didn\u2019t save Naruto. No one knew about him going ape shit or Minato but it\u2019s not like that was her plan. You give her too much credit. She couldn\u2019t have done anything except die before Naruto did and that\u2019s not helping.",

Sasuke (the dude who always looks down upon his peers) trusted Shino to handle Kankuro and wasn't even being bossy towards him. Indicating that he has some respect for him unlike the rest of the rookies.",

And Sasuke left Kankuro for Shino since he looked down on Kankuro too. Kankuro wasn't that strong back then. And Obito would have 0-diffed Shinos bugs but he was playing around.

The jinjhurki of the Shukaku being driven to madness and sevre insomnia, the 8 tails hosts dying like flies because they couldn't handle the power, and why the Uzumaki clan was specifically chosen by the Hidden Leaf to be the hosts of the nine tails, to the clan's immense reserves and ability to suppress tailed beasts.\n\nThe Shin arc was okay even if I was still mad about the ending of Naruto, but I just wished they made Karin, Sarada's mother they look so alike and even their personalities are similar. \n\nIt was alright but I would have preferred them sealing him away rather than killing because I hate that karma seal thing",

Katsuya literally relayed Naruto's message to not interfere.\n\nTo call Naruto stupid for \"almost being killed\" when he straight up got beat by a strong ass character implies everyone who died to Pain is \"stupid\" (this part made me laugh). Jiraiya certainly wasn't stupid for going back to find out the truth of Pain to help beat him.\n\nAnd lastly, without Kurama appearing there, Naruto dies and the world basically ends anyway from his capture.

He has a bond with everyone, a bond he didn\u2019t want to see end. So I think you didn\u2019t really pay attention to his character. He knew he could stand up to Pain and no one else. \n\nIt was stupid and reckless nonetheless. Yeah she might have known she was gonna die but that does nothing. Yeah Katsuya relaying the message is what makes her stupid and reckless. Just because you\u2019re in love doesn\u2019t make it a smart move to go suicidal. \n\nI didn\u2019t call Naruto stupid I said he almost died because of stupidity. Maybe not on his part but stupidity nonetheless. hinata jumping in served no purpose. Only reason Naruto lived was because plot armor essentially. \n\nOkay, and if Naruto was captured then he was captured. And the world would have been destroyed but those deaths are on Pain, not hinata. Without Minato, everyone dies and the blame goes to hinata.",

You mention bonds but dont think he had different weight on his bond with Hinata.. like wow. They literally set up their relationship from the beginning.

That\u2019s essentially what I\u2019ve been trying to say but you\u2019re making it seem likes she\u2019s a fucking hero for jumping in. And again her jumping in changes nothing.

Her job was to not interfere and in her doing so, she would have killed the world. \n\nI\u2019ll gladly die on my hill that hinata is trash but that\u2019s not the point here. The point is that she didn\u2019t save Naruto. No one knew about him going ape shit or Minato but it\u2019s not like that was her plan. You give her too much credit.

Katsuya literally relayed Naruto's message to not interfere.\n\nTo call Naruto stupid for \"almost being killed\" when he straight up got beat by a strong ass character implies everyone who died to Pain is \"stupid\" (this part made me laugh). Jiraiya certainly wasn't stupid for going back to find out the truth of Pain to help beat him.\n\nAnd lastly, without Kurama appearing there, Naruto dies and the world basically ends anyway from his capture.

Naruto loves and cherishes all his friends, you think he wouldn\u2019t have lost his mind if he saw Sakura, Iruka, or Kakashi, or Tsunade, or Sai, or Konohamaru? He has a bond with everyone, a bond he didn\u2019t want to see end. So I think you didn\u2019t really pay attention to his character. He knew he could stand up to Pain and no one else. \n\nIt was stupid and reckless nonetheless. Yeah she might have known she was gonna die but that does nothing. Yeah Katsuya relaying the message is what makes her stupid and reckless. Just because you\u2019re in love doesn\u2019t make it a smart move to go suicidal. \n\nI didn\u2019t call Naruto stupid I said he almost died because of stupidity. Maybe not on his part but stupidity nonetheless. hinata jumping in served no purpose. Only reason Naruto lived was because plot armor essentially. \n\nOkay, and if Naruto was captured then he was captured. And the world would have been destroyed but those deaths are on Pain, not hinata. Without Minato, everyone dies and the blame goes to hinata.",

You mention bonds but dont think he had different weight on his bond with Hinata.. like wow. They literally set up their relationship from the beginning. You're allowed to believe what you want but you gotta pay attention to the story more.\n\nIt's not stupid if you're going to die anyway and you're doing what you feel is right (which is the only possible way to save the situation too). Sounds like you're upset with \"plot armor\" and just calling everything stupid in a tantrum.\n\nI'm not going to go in circles with you. Just pay more attention to the story and dont be so mad that it didnt go the way you wanted it to. There's plenty of non-shonen you should be able to enjoy.",

Also shut up, their relationship was not developed in any way. \n\nNo, plot armor is a given, the show couldn\u2019t kill Naruto but if it had, it was hinata\u2019s fault. That\u2019s essentially what I\u2019ve been trying to say but you\u2019re making it seem likes she\u2019s a fucking hero for jumping in. And again her jumping in changes nothing. She dies, everyone dies, she doesn\u2019t die, world dies, but those deaths aren\u2019t on hinata. Her job was to not interfere and in her doing so, she would have killed the world. \n\nI\u2019ll gladly die on my hill that hinata is trash but that\u2019s not the point here. The point is that she didn\u2019t save Naruto. No one knew about him going ape shit or Minato but it\u2019s not like that was her plan. You give her too much credit. She couldn\u2019t have done anything except die before Naruto did and that\u2019s not helping.",

Naruto loves and cherishes all his friends, you think he wouldn\u2019t have lost his mind if he saw Sakura, Iruka, or Kakashi, or Tsunade, or Sai, or Konohamaru? He has a bond with everyone, a bond he didn\u2019t want to see end. So I think you didn\u2019t really pay attention to his character. He knew he could stand up to Pain and no one else. \n\nIt was stupid and reckless nonetheless. Yeah she might have known she was gonna die but that does nothing. Yeah Katsuya relaying the message is what makes her stupid and reckless. Just because you\u2019re in love doesn\u2019t make it a smart move to go suicidal. \n\nI didn\u2019t call Naruto stupid I said he almost died because of stupidity. Maybe not on his part but stupidity nonetheless. hinata jumping in served no purpose. Only reason Naruto lived was because plot armor essentially. \n\nOkay, and if Naruto was captured then he was captured. And the world would have been destroyed but those deaths are on Pain, not hinata. Without Minato, everyone dies and the blame goes to hinata.",

You mention bonds but dont think he had different weight on his bond with Hinata.. like wow. They literally set up their relationship from the beginning. You're allowed to believe what you want but you gotta pay attention to the story more.\n\nIt's not stupid if you're going to die anyway and you're doing what you feel is right (which is the only possible way to save the situation too). Sounds like you're upset with \"plot armor\" and just calling everything stupid in a tantrum.\n\nI'm not going to go in circles with you. Just pay more attention to the story and dont be so mad that it didnt go the way you wanted it to. There's plenty of non-shonen you should be able to enjoy.",

Also shut up, their relationship was not developed in any way. \n\nNo, plot armor is a given, the show couldn\u2019t kill Naruto but if it had, it was hinata\u2019s fault. That\u2019s essentially what I\u2019ve been trying to say but you\u2019re making it seem likes she\u2019s a fucking hero for jumping in. And again her jumping in changes nothing. She dies, everyone dies, she doesn\u2019t die, world dies, but those deaths aren\u2019t on hinata. Her job was to not interfere and in her doing so, she would have killed the world. \n\nI\u2019ll gladly die on my hill that hinata is trash but that\u2019s not the point here. The point is that she didn\u2019t save Naruto. No one knew about him going ape shit or Minato but it\u2019s not like that was her plan. You give her too much credit.

He has a bond with everyone, a bond he didn\u2019t want to see end. So I think you didn\u2019t really pay attention to his character. He knew he could stand up to Pain and no one else. \n\nIt was stupid and reckless nonetheless. Yeah she might have known she was gonna die but that does nothing. Yeah Katsuya relaying the message is what makes her stupid and reckless. Just because you\u2019re in love doesn\u2019t make it a smart move to go suicidal. \n\nI didn\u2019t call Naruto stupid I said he almost died because of stupidity. Maybe not on his part but stupidity nonetheless. hinata jumping in served no purpose. Only reason Naruto lived was because plot armor essentially. \n\nOkay, and if Naruto was captured then he was captured. And the world would have been destroyed but those deaths are on Pain, not hinata. Without Minato, everyone dies and the blame goes to hinata.",

That\u2019s essentially what I\u2019ve been trying to say but you\u2019re making it seem likes she\u2019s a fucking hero for jumping in. And again her jumping in changes nothing.

Her job was to not interfere and in her doing so, she would have killed the world. \n\nI\u2019ll gladly die on my hill that hinata is trash but that\u2019s not the point here. The point is that she didn\u2019t save Naruto. No one knew about him going ape shit or Minato but it\u2019s not like that was her plan. You give her too much credit.

You mention bonds but dont think he had different weight on his bond with Hinata.. like wow. They literally set up their relationship from the beginning. You're allowed to believe what you want but you gotta pay attention to the story more.\n\nIt's not stupid if you're going to die anyway and you're doing what you feel is right (which is the only possible way to save the situation too). Sounds like you're upset with \"plot armor\" and just calling everything stupid in a tantrum.\n\nI'm not going to go in circles with you. Just pay more attention to the story and dont be so mad that it didnt go the way you wanted it to. There's plenty of non-shonen you should be able to enjoy.",
