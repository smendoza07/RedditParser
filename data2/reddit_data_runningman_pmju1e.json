A combination of balanced athleticism, self-awareness, charm, and sense of humor that is just different from the rest of the members. His loss was the first true loss for Running Man, followed by LKS the Variety God Avatar. \n\nA true darkhorse, with equal dumb and smart moments. Outwitted and outwitting, ousting and get ousted, and the only person who could ousted KJK on his own (very rare, but it happened) with mere speed. \n\nNot to mention the LOLOL clones and the squid jokes, as well as years of wooing SJH. The Monday Couple trope is only a part of what makes him legendary. Remember he won the ultimate running man more than once, traveling to UK and stuff.  \n\nA true Random Capable, entertaining in many aspects. Not to mention the amount of Leessang songs used in RM during the Monday Couple sessions or general romance thingy. \n\nHe is to be missed.",
