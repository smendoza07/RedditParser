This sub is willing to help ( on mobile but I think one of the top posts was about a guy who asked help and admitted to thinning hair ) but most people don't post a lot of info to go off of or even follow the sidebar. I personally think we need to stop helping the one pic submiters. We should report them / only comment \" read the sidebar\". As much as I agree to your variety, people need to post more info.
