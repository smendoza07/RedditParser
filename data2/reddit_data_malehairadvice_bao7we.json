Don\u2019t get me wrong, it looks great, but there are things he can do to really take it to the next level. Curly hair is really delicate and it\u2019s treatment varies from person to person.\n\nMy whole life i thought i had unmanageable, frizzy, dry, straight hair. I found r/nopoo somehow and tried that out with not much luck. Then i found r/curlyhair and it changed my life. Knowing the right shampoos, conditioners, and products to use is incredibly important.\n\nFor me, I shampoo 1x/2x per week and I condition almost every day. I apply a few drops of oil on the ends of my hair and then use a gel that i let sit until it dries. Then i crunch out the hardness and i\u2019m left with really nice & hydrated curls\n\nedit: spelling",

Don\u2019t get me wrong, it looks great, but there are things he can do to really take it to the next level. Curly hair is really delicate and it\u2019s treatment varies from person to person.\n\nMy whole life i thought i had unmanageable, frizzy, dry, straight hair. I found r/nopoo somehow and tried that out with not much luck. Then i found r/curlyhair and it changed my life. Knowing the right shampoos, conditioners, and products to use is incredibly important.\n\nFor me, I shampoo 1x/2x per week and I condition almost every day. I apply a few drops of oil on the ends of my hair and then use a gel that i let sit until it dries. Then i crunch out the hardness and i\u2019m left with really nice & hydrated curls\n\nedit: spelling",

Don\u2019t get me wrong, it looks great, but there are things he can do to really take it to the next level. Curly hair is really delicate and it\u2019s treatment varies from person to person.\n\nMy whole life i thought i had unmanageable, frizzy, dry, straight hair. I found r/nopoo somehow and tried that out with not much luck. Then i found r/curlyhair and it changed my life. Knowing the right shampoos, conditioners, and products to use is incredibly important.\n\nFor me, I shampoo 1x/2x per week and I condition almost every day. I apply a few drops of oil on the ends of my hair and then use a gel that i let sit until it dries. Then i crunch out the hardness and i\u2019m left with really nice & hydrated curls\n\nedit: spelling",
