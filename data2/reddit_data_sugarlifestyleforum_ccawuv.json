    "body": "Stop using group photos! No good can come from it.\n\n1. Are your friends okay having their face on a website like SA?\n\n2. Do you really want to be the \"ugly\" friend? It's really hard to find a SD when competing against other women's profiles. The last thing you want to do is have another woman/women who is/are more attractive than you on your own profile.\n\n3. Even if you think you are the attractive one out of your group, there are going to be a number of SDs who don't think so. (Example, I'm more likely to take the quiet/nerdy girl look over the \"hot blonde\" every day of the week.)\n\n4. At best you may be catfishing semi-intentionally. You are not going to win a SD over if you are not the one he thinks/hopes he is talking to. \n\nAt the end of the day, just please be honest about this. It's your best chance to find a SD.",

I got tired of having good conversations with POTs and then they are like \"wait.... that's you? I thought you were a cute little fish? I'm not banging some scrawny ass nerd, that's fucking gross.\"\n#\n Got a little disheartening. I know not everyone will like me, and there's always more fish in the sea, but it felt like one particular handsome little fish was getting more than his share.",

I think the exchange would be entertaining AF! The number of puns, double entendres and man-fish-sex would be huge!\n\n>I was going to have type up the \"no fish sex\" explanation all over again, and it made me exhausted just thinking about it. ... Fuck, at some point it's just not worth it, you know?\n\nAbsolutely! Hell, the whole \"no man-fish-bear-sex\" thing I've had to explain to the un-enlightened masses before? The stress with that is palpable! \n\n> I'm going to just block kanye west and listen to lesser rap music.\n\nAhh I KNEW there was a non-sequitur buried in your whole note!\nFor \"lesser\" rap music to exist, it would require a measured existence toward \"higher\" rap music - which as we all know, does not exist! Good try though! \n\n\nYou'll have to do better with that in the future!",

Fuck, at some point it's just not worth it, you know?\n\nAbsolutely! Hell, the whole \"no man-fish-bear-sex\" thing I've had to explain to the un-enlightened masses before? The stress with that is palpable! \n\n> I'm going to just block kanye west and listen to lesser rap music.\n\nAhh I KNEW there was a non-sequitur buried in your whole note!\nFor \"lesser\" rap music to exist, it would require a measured existence toward \"higher\" rap music - which as we all know, does not exist! Good try though! \n\n\nYou'll have to do better with that in the future!",

Good try though! \n\n\nYou'll have to do better with that in the future!",

Fuck, at some point it's just not worth it, you know?\n\nAbsolutely! Hell, the whole \"no man-fish-bear-sex\" thing I've had to explain to the un-enlightened masses before? The stress with that is palpable! \n\n> I'm going to just block kanye west and listen to lesser rap music.\n\nAhh I KNEW there was a non-sequitur buried in your whole note!\nFor \"lesser\" rap music to exist, it would require a measured existence toward \"higher\" rap music - which as we all know, does not exist! Good try though! \n\n\nYou'll have to do better with that in the future!",
