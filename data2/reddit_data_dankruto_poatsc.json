Life can be there one minute, and gone the next, and that left a really big mark on him. He was done with grieving, with seeing others grieve, and with living as such a mortal, himself, leading him down the darker path that he inevitably took. It might seem ridiculous, but I don\u2019t think Kishimoto could have done anything better. Actually witnessing such a thing would have been a lot more shocking than us watching it from our point of view.",
