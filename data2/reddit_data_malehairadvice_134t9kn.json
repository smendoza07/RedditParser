I still don't think I'm that attractive but I've learned that I'm not bad at all. It was my environment and the people who surrounded me that made me feel bad about myself.\n\nHate to be cliche but have some confidence in yourself. Socialize, have fun, and be who you are. Laugh and have fun. At the same time, elevate yourself in terms of abilities and style. The confidence you radiate from these things will instantly make your so much more attractive.\n\nDon't waste your youth like I did. You are not a bad looking guy at all. In fact, you look like one of my best buddies that pull mad hot girls. Hell, I have a buddy who's not as attractive as you are that pull 9s and 10s and I can provide proof. It's who you are that comes off.\n\nWould love to chat if you have questions. There are so many people out there that are average at best thinking they're the shit and they pull way more girls, and some of them are the reason why you don't feel like you can do the same. They're just jealous, and they need to put people like you down so they can win. Don't let them.",
