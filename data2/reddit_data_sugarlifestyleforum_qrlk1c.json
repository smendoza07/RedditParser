    "body": "Or, to be more accurate, it has opened my eyes to how untrusting I should have been all along.\n\nMy personal rule is firm: No cheaters. Anyone who is married, who reveals at the M&G that they aren\u2019t as unmarried as their profile indicates, or\u2014as happened on a M&G last night\u2014reveals they have an unsuspecting committed girlfriend gets an immediate pass.\n\nMulling over last night\u2019s experience, I realized that the longer I spend in the sugar community, the less trusting I become of future vanilla partners; sugaring has opened my eyes to just how little people can actually be trusted. Seeing in real time just how many men are fine with sleeping around on their wives or girlfriends is equal parts elucidating and appalling. \n\nI\u2019m curious if others have found themselves having similar thoughts after seeing all the married profiles on offer.",

And you're extrapolating that characteristic to all men.  But all men aren't on SA, not all men sugar.  I think this is also why escorts end up having such low opinions of men so frequently.  Their sample set is skewed to include a higher percentage of liars and sleezeballs.  The same exact thing would probably happen if you worked in a prison.  It can make you jaded, distrustful, angry.  If that happens, I would think it's best to get out and/or surround yourself with better people who can help you restore your faith in humanity.",

My Ex, even in the more open relationship we had still managed to violate the agreement and cheat...   \n[Dr House Quote](https://s4.scoopwhoop.com/anj/Hugh/404338642.png)  \n\n\nAmong my guy friends, some married, some divorced, one or two never married, many of them are hypocrites.   They would personally be fine to go hook up, or at least engage in some behavior (flirting, etc) that would piss them off royally if their wives/GFs did it.   The rules have to be the same for both sides, even if we have a dead marriage.  Hell it might improve things if she would go out and get some good dicking down.\n\nu/SaccharineSpice  I have wondered about it for a while now how it is impacting the SBs long term.  I am not sitting in judgement of others, just wondering about the effects.  \n\n\nI paid a LOT of money for my divorce and it was worth EVERY penny.  It was toxic and never should have happened.  Many SDs have a far more complex decision to make.  I do not envy their situations.",

I\u2019m not saying either of those is a good enough reason, but it is what it is. \n\nI can\u2019t do anything about the first part besides being careful about who I date. I also make clear to my partners that if he wants to sleep with someone else we can talk about it and probably come up with a solution.\n\nFor the second issue, I can make sure that I stay present in my relationships. I guess I\u2019m a bit lucky because I have a high sex drive, but I\u2019ve never dated someone who was left wanting sexually. To be fair, I\u2019ve ended all of my relationships within 3.5 years, but I can\u2019t imagine hearing that my partner wasn\u2019t fulfilled with his sex life and not stepping it up enough that he\u2019s comfortable.\n\nBut I think it usually goes deeper than sex. The people I\u2019m close to who have cheated have universally expressed frustration at the lack of appreciation/consideration their partner shows them. I actually learned this part of the issue first hand when my boyfriend (with whom I was having daily sex) cheated on me. During our debrief session, my ex expressed that he didn\u2019t feel like I needed him. The hot session with the girl who was falling over herself to sleep with him allowed him to feel the appreciation that I hadn\u2019t been showing him. While I don\u2019t excuse his actions and it ended our relationship, I learned a lot from that experience.\n\nI won\u2019t try to pretend that sugaring won\u2019t cause me to look harder at future partners. But it has shown me that I can\u2019t take what I have for granted.",

Guys who say they are single/divorced/separated but then suspiciously are only available to get together, weirdly enough, weekday mornings. It\u2019s happened a few times now where I talk to someone, am initially happy to have a low pressure first meeting, grabbing a quick coffee or lunch. But then the pattern continues\u2026 I\u2019ve learned that weekday mornings are popular with cheating men because wife is at work, kid is at school/daycare and/or if the guy is working he can take a few hours off without his family knowing and no one is the wiser to what he\u2019s really up to\u2014except me, now. It\u2019s such a bummer. I\u2019m not going to participate in cheating, full stop, and hate that I am so jaded now: automatically suspicious when a guy can\u2019t make plans at a time that would be normal for someone not hiding something. I know it isn\u2019t all men, of course, but it does seem to be a thing I\u2019ve been noticing recently and with more frequency, and it\u2019s so depressing!!!",

This ying and yang is a key factor in gender studies.  It has driven a huge amount of cultural change and variations.  It frankly is really interesting.\n\nLet's just say that's a lot of BS right after the 'helpless infant for several years'. Once the child is weaned off, nothing stop the mother to go out and do whatever she wants - except some stupid archaic stuff called marriage that relegates her role to that of servitude to a man. Our laws have been made so that SHE (vs HE) is tied to raising the infant as if it was her sole responsibility. \n\nThe rest is pretty solid.",

One could easily start to see everyone as a criminal or a pos and have a very low opinion of people. Does that mean all people are criminals ? No.  The bowl does have a lot of married men, yes. But thats just the demographic that's on there. Lots of older guys with money who are trapped in dead bedrooms. Many sbs don't like dating younger, single sds. Lower allowances, clingy, blowing up your phone, wanting extra meets. There's pros and cons to it. Cheating is a universal truth in and out if the bowl, on both sides. Men , AND women cheat. It's actually much less easier for men to cheat. It's much harder to get laid as a man, let alone find a woman who is okay with that. Take yourself for example. Women on the other hand, have endless infinite options to cheat, and most men will sleep with her given the opportunity. In my opinion, women cheat more than men do, check out the adultery subreddit, there are absolutely no shortage of posts from women. I think humans by nature are not inherently monogamous, we are designed to reproduce to increase our numbers. Monogomy is a social construct we've created , that is very hard to adhere to. I would say in my personal experience, very few people are serial cheaters or sex addicts, and that people cheat because of very specific reasons they aren't happy in that relationship. If your faith in monogamy and marriage has been compromised, I highly suggest working on yourself as a person, and becoming the best partner you can be. We can't control people, but we can reduce the chances of cheating pretty significantly by being a great human being and partner.  I know for a fact if my SO is taking care of business, ill never cheat, because I don't want to loose her.",

Also in vanilla dating I have never asked someone if they were married or in a relationship.\n\nI respect your strong views on this, but for me it feels like an intrusion in their privacy to care about that thing. If they promised each other fidelity that's a thing just between them. I am no party to such an agreement. If a guy sleeps with me thereby cheating on his wife, I see myself more as a bystander to the crime than as an accomplice. Any grown person should be able to decide for themselves whether they want to cheat on their partner. Their motive is none of my business. At the same time, when a man who I find attractive turns down sex with me because he doesn't want to cheat on his wife, I absolutely respect that.\n\nThis goes the other way round as well: My SD doubled my allowance for me to be with him exclusively. When other men approach me or express their interest, I decline. But that is solely my job and they are not to blame for trying.\n\nWhen your trust in men is suffering because of your experiences, you might just get a more realistic, less naive perspective. And since you are worried about future partner: I still think it can be possible for you to find someone in whose fidelity you trust -- not because of a general trust in all men but, even better, because of a personal and special relationship of trust just with him.",

My grandpa had a side chick for over ten years until my grandma found out about it. I was a child back then. My grandma needed some time to decide whether she can forgive him and it was a hard decision for her. Eventually she did and their marriage is very happy today, I think. But she needed to deal with the question whether she could forgive him. Blaming the other woman instead of my grandpa would just have been a way to avoid dealing with the real issue: his infidelity (or his willingness to that).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>It's unrealistic and naive to expect men in long-term, committed relationships not to sleep with other people?

That's not what I'm saying. Your grandpa was the one who betrayed your grandma, not the other woman.\n\nI get where you're coming from, but I see it this way: If you're knowingly sleeping with someone who is cheating, you aren't responsible for their actions but you *are* responsible for your own. You know that (A) that person is lying to their partner and (B) you are an active participant in helping them do it. Point A will happen whether or not you participate, as someone who is determined to cheat will find a way, but you can control point B.\n\nI know there is a wide range of opinions on this, particularly in this sub, and I don't expect to change anyone's mind.

Even if you are only trying to sugar with single men.  \n\nThe world can't be defined by the 1/1000th maybe more like 1/1,000,000 of the population.  There are so few people sugaring that thinking all married men cheat is a completely slanted and untrue view of the world.  \n\nThe reason why men use sugar is for two reasons, they pay because when they end it there are no significant repercussions, i.e. alimony etc.  Second there very few hot young women who want to date married men on the side for zero dollars.   It's pretty rare and in this day in age, an older man asking anything remotely like a pick line to a young women is more likely to get a drink thrown at them and be told that they are a creep.  \n\nIs sugaring close to escorting? To be blunt - yes, though I think the terms of engagement are better for the women with the sugaring sites as the methods of engaging before intimacy are really defined by the sugar baby.  But if you are loosing trust in this world by what you are seeing - that's not a good way to live.  There is a lot of good in this world and there are many good men and women who are not defined by nor do they know of sugaring.  People live by different codes, vaxed / unvaxed to name one hot topic not.

But also being able to safely access some novelty without imploding your primary, or getting lawyers to divide it all up 4 ways with bitterness dripping all over the spoils might just be better than taking a hard line. I frame it very comfortably that  way. I am literally providing something that keeps the primary from imploding.\n\nIf you can reframe it with a bit of research you might find you and your future primary relationships enjoy non monogamy. You may realise that trust is about so much more than only experiencing intimacy with one person.\n\nOr it might not be your thing, and that's absolutely right for you.",

Hell it might improve things if she would go out and get some good dicking down.\n\nu/SaccharineSpice  I have wondered about it for a while now how it is impacting the SBs long term.

This ying and yang is a key factor in gender studies.  It has driven a huge amount of cultural change and variations.  It frankly is really interesting.\n\nLet's just say that's a lot of BS right after the 'helpless infant for several years'. Once the child is weaned off, nothing stop the mother to go out and do whatever she wants - except some stupid archaic stuff called marriage that relegates her role to that of servitude to a man. Our laws have been made so that SHE (vs HE) is tied to raising the infant as if it was her sole responsibility. \n\nThe rest is pretty solid.",

From the perspective of a straight woman to whom a partner's fidelity is of great importance (more so than to me), it is only natural to focus on men's fidelity. Also, she specifically cited the experiences she made as a SB. These were probably all with men.\n\nShe should rather be credited for only talking about things she knows about; not about unfaithful wives. You on the other hand immediately showed a weak and defensive reaction ('but the girls were mean too!').",

My grandpa had a side chick for over ten years until my grandma found out about it. I was a child back then. My grandma needed some time to decide whether she can forgive him and it was a hard decision for her. Eventually she did and their marriage is very happy today, I think. But she needed to deal with the question whether she could forgive him. Blaming the other woman instead of my grandpa would just have been a way to avoid dealing with the real issue: his infidelity (or his willingness to that).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>It's unrealistic and naive to expect men in long-term, committed relationships not to sleep with other people?

That's not what I'm saying. Your grandpa was the one who betrayed your grandma, not the other woman.\n\nI get where you're coming from, but I see it this way: If you're knowingly sleeping with someone who is cheating, you aren't responsible for their actions but you *are* responsible for your own. You know that (A) that person is lying to their partner and (B) you are an active participant in helping them do it. Point A will happen whether or not you participate, as someone who is determined to cheat will find a way, but you can control point B.\n\nI know there is a wide range of opinions on this, particularly in this sub, and I don't expect to change anyone's mind.

The language in the vows is \"to have and to hold\", not \"to fuck and to blow\", and I can't think of any legal statute that says a wife becomes defined as a friend as soon as they stop putting out. Cheating may be a natural outcome of a dead bedroom, but it's not a legally sanctioned one.",

Also, she specifically cited the experiences she made as a SB.

You on the other hand immediately showed a weak and defensive reaction ('but the girls were mean too!').",
