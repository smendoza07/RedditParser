But Choji realizes that even someone trash like himself can give up his life to save his friends and complete the mission, so he eats the 3rd pill, turns into OP butterfly mode (a direct metaphor to his character arc progression), wins, then dies. And is assumedly left lying there for a long ass time because we see when Shikamaru realizes Choji must have just died (chakra connects us all!).\n\nThen the genius Neji comes up against someone who can counter him really well, and it's like oh man even though Neji is OP, he can't win this! And Neji is forced into a corner where he realizes that his only way to win is to get his opponent to kill Neji is a specific way. So Neji gets ultra-killed with a giant hole punched straight through his torso, but he made sure that it would give himself an extra second or two to live which he could use to kill his opponent. And it worked. So we get the whole Neji arc that started in the chunin exams come to a close as he has a super emotional journey during this fight to realize what it means to be free and choose your destiny and all that.\n\n.\n\n.... then a few episodes later Shikamaru is in the leaf village crying about how he got everyone killed and his dad is like \"actually Tsunade healed them. They are in 100% perfect health.\"\n\nWat.\n\nThis is around the time that ninja stop being regular humans who can die from knives. Eventually leading up to everyone just healing from laser blasts and stuff.",

Naruto could have driven that Rasengan into Sasuke\u2019s dome. At the start of the fight tho Sasuke told Naruto he wouldn\u2019t even scratch his headband. So Naruto was aiming to prove a point. \n\nSame with Sasuke. He closed his hand at the last second which made it so his chidori didn\u2019t actually pierce the way it usually does. Tho I contend that Naruto still probably wouldn\u2019t have died to that. \n\nThey both pulled their punches at the last second, but I\u2019m fairly sure Naruto was doing that for most of the fight while Sasuke wasn\u2019t until then. Ya know, since he rammed his hand through Naruto\u2019s chest earlier with no earthly idea he\u2019d survive it.",

But Choji realizes that even someone trash like himself can give up his life to save his friends and complete the mission, so he eats the 3rd pill, turns into OP butterfly mode (a direct metaphor to his character arc progression), wins, then dies. And is assumedly left lying there for a long ass time because we see when Shikamaru realizes Choji must have just died (chakra connects us all!).\n\nThen the genius Neji comes up against someone who can counter him really well, and it's like oh man even though Neji is OP, he can't win this! And Neji is forced into a corner where he realizes that his only way to win is to get his opponent to kill Neji is a specific way. So Neji gets ultra-killed with a giant hole punched straight through his torso, but he made sure that it would give himself an extra second or two to live which he could use to kill his opponent. And it worked. So we get the whole Neji arc that started in the chunin exams come to a close as he has a super emotional journey during this fight to realize what it means to be free and choose your destiny and all that.\n\n.\n\n.... then a few episodes later Shikamaru is in the leaf village crying about how he got everyone killed and his dad is like \"actually Tsunade healed them. They are in 100% perfect health.\"\n\nWat.\n\nThis is around the time that ninja stop being regular humans who can die from knives. Eventually leading up to everyone just healing from laser blasts and stuff.",

But Choji realizes that even someone trash like himself can give up his life to save his friends and complete the mission, so he eats the 3rd pill, turns into OP butterfly mode (a direct metaphor to his character arc progression), wins, then dies. And is assumedly left lying there for a long ass time because we see when Shikamaru realizes Choji must have just died (chakra connects us all!).\n\nThen the genius Neji comes up against someone who can counter him really well, and it's like oh man even though Neji is OP, he can't win this! And Neji is forced into a corner where he realizes that his only way to win is to get his opponent to kill Neji is a specific way. So Neji gets ultra-killed with a giant hole punched straight through his torso, but he made sure that it would give himself an extra second or two to live which he could use to kill his opponent. And it worked. So we get the whole Neji arc that started in the chunin exams come to a close as he has a super emotional journey during this fight to realize what it means to be free and choose your destiny and all that.\n\n.\n\n.... then a few episodes later Shikamaru is in the leaf village crying about how he got everyone killed and his dad is like \"actually Tsunade healed them. They are in 100% perfect health.\"\n\nWat.\n\nThis is around the time that ninja stop being regular humans who can die from knives. Eventually leading up to everyone just healing from laser blasts and stuff.",
