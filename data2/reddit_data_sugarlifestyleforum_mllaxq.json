    "body": "Today I was chatting with a POT, one who messaged me even though he lives a handful of hours away and professes not to be able to meet until COVID is somewhat resolved.\n\nGot the sense he\u2019d be a prolific texter, which, amidst a nice arrangement, I really enjoy, but with a man who I\u2019ve not met yet, who I\u2019ll likely only see 6-10 a year, if and only if a successful M+G happens wheneverrrrr COVID is over?? \ud83e\uddd0 not so much, unless he\u2019s being as generous with his resources as I am with my texting time. Mutually beneficial relationships, am I right??\n\nTbh I\u2019m getting timewaster vibes. He\u2019s probably the type to angrily state that he\u2019d NEVER send an Amazon gift, even tho he expects hours of dirty texting before the first meet. Who\u2019s the bad actor in the bowl in this situation? Doesn\u2019t seem like me. \n\nAnyways, I was like \u201cfuck it, I\u2019m just gonna broach the PPM chat, cause I\u2019m not about texting forever to find out that our PPM ranges are miles apart\u201d. \n\nThen it goes down like this: \n\n* I ask him if he\u2019d like to share the range he typically gives for PPM. \n\n* He ignores my question, and then two texts later asks me if I would be comfortable sharing my range\n*(Imagine thinking that would work hahahahahaha)*\n\n* I literally copied and pasted the text I originally sent, with me asking him if he\u2019d like to share \n\n* he responds that he\u2019d prefer if I share and he just says if my numbers will work or not. \n\n* I tell him that\u2019s also what I prefer and that I asked first \ud83d\ude02\n\n#Now he\u2019s silent LOL\nSuits me fine, as I\u2019m not typically into beta men, anyways \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\n\nThe moral of this story? Expecting hours of texting before an arrangement begins is inappropriate. Get to know each other enough to schedule a meet and greet and then have the damn meet and greet. Seeking isnt 1900FreeTexts. \n\nAlso: Dont share your real number with people, especially if it brings up your full name, LinkedIn and your wife\u2019s names on google. I\u2019m not a blackmailer but some women are. \n\nFinally: bring up money first, if you want the upper hand. Otherwise known as \u201cbe a gd gentleman and get money talks out of the way, so you both can enjoy each other\u201d. Imagine being the national manager of a large multinational and still not knowing how to confidently state your range or talk about money!\n\nImagine expecting hours of texting with a woman you\u2019ve never met or given anything to ....that doesn\u2019t make you a SD, it makes you a user trying to take advantage of someone.\n\nThoughts on this? Is it the new normal that a man expects to engage in countless hours of texting before even meeting you?\n\n#UPDATE\nJust got a message here, calling me a cynical, jaded bitch. Ummm? Why am I cynical for wanting ROI? \n\nFor all those thinking \u201cROI?? Sounds like a pro treating this like a business!!\u201d - just remember that next time you\u2019re dropping some comment about how you pay the lowest PPM you can manage, but \u201cthat\u2019s what the market will bear\u201d",

If I give her a range, of course I expect her to say \"$Y is good for me\".  And putting myself in a POT SB's shoes, she has every right to feel bad if I tell her \"I give my SBs anywhere from $X to $Y\", and then I offer her the very bottom of the range.\n\nTo me the whole range thing feels like just more game-playing because someone feels \"awkward\".  What I've found makes me the most comfortable is that I give my offer first, and it's $Z, not a range.  And as debated ad nauseum in other threads, I'm totally open if she wants to suggest something else.",

I've had some arrangements where on top of my PPM I was given a lot of expensive gifts, taken on trips, went to shows, etc. I'm willing to go for a slightly lower amount in that situation. Conversely, I've insisted on higher PPMs from people who lived far away as I had to factor 2+ hours of driving into the equation. So a range *can* make sense if there is justification as to what is expected from the top and bottom end of it.",

YES   verify that she is pursuing an intimate arrangement and YES  he is prepared to provide an allowance ( perhaps  a broad range) .  \n\nAs the other party noted in a business transaction,  I could name the price if he got to name the terms (after I set the price) \n\nThe reason for my hesitancy to discuss this with someone I have not met is not so much wanting to see them in real life but rather to communicate where words, facial expressions and body language are all available for interpretation. \n\nAlso the M&G is an opportunity to discover added attractions of the other party.  Finally it is a place to discuss the \"rules of the road\" in terms expectations, limitations  etc. Finally a way to find creative bridges across areas where there is not full agreement .  \n\nOne example was (some time ago when it was more traditional to monthly allowance) that this worked with a half month prior to  initial intimacy  and converted to the equivalent of a monthly allowance repeated every 4th meeting (discourages cancellations that are not infrequent with monthly allowance) \n\n(( a note to SB   there are 13   4 week periods in a year.  For the reliable this is an extra allowance period per year)) \n\nLastly,  I think discussing and then seeking a common agreement in real time and having met the person is much more likely to result in a lasting relationship.",

It isn't at ALL about games/gamers.  \"\n\nI do appreciate the advice.  However, I was studying game theory at a well known eastern business school around the time yo mama was  trying to potty train you. But of more relevance to sugar arrangements is that you have illustrated one of two approaches to relationships. \n\nThe missing ingredients are an understanding of the mission and value.  \n\nThe wizards of wall street were smug in their financial markets of the 2006 era.  Game Theory flowed from multiple orifices.  They were the masters of the universe, making billions with complex financial transactions that were above mortal understanding. \n\nThey had, they proclaimed, repealed the laws of financial physics. I worked with them as part of my role as an adjunct faculty gig helping to organize several public programs on securitized finance.  \n\nThere was also a young grad student who also looked at the same financial markets, all the synthetic vehicles   and the fundamentals. He carefully traced the path from the homeowner getting a loan to the securitization, to the financial vehicles created by the banks and wall street to the bets placed for and against them. \n\nHis well researched analysis was that the housing finance market and the banking industry  were going to collapse with catastrophic global consequences. He was having difficulty raising capital for a fund that would bet against the tycoons of Wall Street,  but finally was successful. Unfortunately, unlike prior abuses of the markets, the then administration decided that the Wizards were so important they should not serve  the hard time they deserved. \n\n Only 18 months later the grad student  had, according to The Economist, the highest performing hedge fund in the world while many of the banks were just looking to survive. The masters of the financial universe were crushed along with their clients.  His farewell letter to wall street, published in the WSJ and other national/international journals was a classic. \n\nHe returned from self imposed exile a few  years ago with another well researched , out of the box , idea and strategy.  Today an investment of $1,000 is worth $ 30,000 , throughout ,the investment has been secured with physical ownership and possession of an un-leveraged commodity.  The relevance to sugar is that the primary focus  should be on a methodical analysis of what is  important (creates value)  to you and only then search to find someone whose characteristics best fit your needs with a minimum of conflict areas. \n\n The relevance to Arrangements is finding success through recognition of value rather than playing with game theory.  There's also the matter of the allowance you deliver and the way you treat an SB will eventually be reflected in her relationship with you. \n\n It is a lesson far too many SD fail to learn until  the have suffered from the  \"allowance is everything\" SB sticking and the quality, broader relationship seeking SB's having disappeared into the arms of an SD who understood value in a relationship and that relationships seldom flower when they are not mutually beneficial.\n\nI regret that I have no interest in another Porsche",

        {
            "body": "It\u2019s been awhile since I\u2019ve done this in any meaningful way. However may I ask why SBs wouldn\u2019t set the tone or the lead with the following: \nA few good pictures. At least one full,body shot and one smiling. Keep it brief and upbeat. Put in the profile to contact you. In the profile state up front that you don\u2019t want to text initially. Get a Google number and set up a meet and greet at a nice place. If they cancel twice then next them. Near the sugar baby\u2019s home or in the middle. Before you meet have one long phone call where the SB is effectively prescreening before they meet. Have a seemingly organic cOnversation. Don\u2019t ask about what they do or family or anything like that. Teasingly say I know you are successful but if you won 3xs what you make what would you do with it? The answers will naturally spark a convo and in many ways he will be qualifying himself. He will talk about boats if he has them or had them. Skiing, would he start a restaurant cause he is a foodie? Or is he strictly middle management? All will be revealed within the conversation. If he comes up light then later regretfully break the date and be polite. If you get a good vibe then end the call in less than a hour with the objective of setting up the M&G.  Less time is wasted for you. If he is not interested enough to wait for a second or third date then he is not interested enough period.\n\nOnce you qualify him during that initial phone conversation, then you tell him what you are looking for in a allowance , how and when you need it. Let him know you will send this via email after the date. Don\u2019t ask for money but make sure you don\u2019t go to far out of the way for him either. Choose a great place that YOU want to go to. Make sure it is close to home. Keep it light, sexy and touch him unnecessarily. Don\u2019t use the word dont, won\u2019t or hate. Don\u2019t let him nor you, talk about ex\u2019s or the sucky bowl. Don\u2019t talk about work. Keep the convo soft focus and slightly naughty. Talk about the future, things you both love to do,or want to try. At the end of the date, no more than three hours if you are having fun, end the date. Lean into him and make out like teenagers in the parking lot then go home. If he wants you he will contact you and there will be a second or third date. Leave him with something to want. \n\nIf he does NOT contact you you did not put out for nothing in a sense. Unless you don\u2019t mind doing Pay per play sessions. You did not drive that far and you had a great meal. It takes less time and aggravation to do that than endless texting that peters out. If he can\u2019t take you to a nice place without hedging then he can\u2019t afford what you want. Again you qualified him. You set the tone by having subtle sequential steps that you set up and drive forward. Energy and excitement needs to be created and men are visual and action oriented so SB has to know how to amp up sexual tension and how to close the deal. To be blunt give him some green lights. \n\nAlso these things seldom last more than a year. 6 months is the average. Time is really on the SB side for about 6 months. Typically that is when they are the hottest for you. It\u2019s just nature unless the SB is unusually adept at extending these situations. So again to be blunt the SB is most likely to get what she wants within the first three months. Money, a trip, a class whatever, that is when a SD will put out. \nSo in like a lion, out like a lamb. Not the other way around. \n\nInstead of texting send a cute photo of yourself whatever you are doing. No full nudes. Provoke a little jealousy by letting him see you smile at other men but not disrespectfully. Ask how he likes women to dress when he is out that way and actually DRESS that way. Ask him if he likes the out fit, you wore it for him. \nIt\u2019s up to the SB IMO to set the pace and mix it up. If he only does indoors make damn sure you are going to high end hotels and that you order in for the next 24 hrs. Even if he has to go make sure you keep the room. Order breakfast in with champagne, get in that hot tub. Tell him you saw that they had a spa there and you would like to have both of you go or they come to the room. Have a sushi night where you get buzzed on saki and he eats sushi off your naked body. It\u2019s corny but amusing. If he mentions he loved smoking pot but hasn\u2019t done it in years, next time you meet have a big blunt rolled, vape or whatever. Just start smoking it in a place that is safe and secure. Tell him weed makes you extra wild and that you know he loves it but hadn\u2019t smoked in a while. Have a munchie basket set aside. \n\nIf he can\u2019t or won\u2019t afford what YOU want, what ever that is then you should know by the second date if it gets that far. I would keep track of them to. There is not a infinite pool,of qualified SD out there if SB are just using this medium to meet. Eventually the same top tier of the SD and SB will be recycled until new talent comes in. Personally I would try and have 2 or three SDs that I would see a month. \n\nI agree with sassysugar\u2019s approach for the most part. \n\nThe crux is its a business it just can\u2019t be presented as such. Entertainment is big business and a human need. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

What I've found makes me the most comfortable is that I give my offer first, and it's $Z, not a range.

Finally it is a place to discuss the \"rules of the road\" in terms expectations, limitations  etc. Finally a way to find creative bridges across areas where there is not full agreement .  \n\nOne example was (some time ago when it was more traditional to monthly allowance) that this worked with a half month prior to  initial intimacy  and converted to the equivalent of a monthly allowance repeated every 4th meeting (discourages cancellations that are not infrequent with monthly allowance) \n\n(( a note to SB   there are 13   4 week periods in a year.  For the reliable this is an extra allowance period per year)) \n\nLastly,  I think discussing and then seeking a common agreement in real time and having met the person is much more likely to result in a lasting relationship.",

                            "body": ">\" Game theory is at the heart of modern understandings of contracts and negotiations. I pity that you don't know about it. It isn't at ALL about games/gamers.  \"\n\nI do appreciate the advice.  However, I was studying game theory at a well known eastern business school around the time yo mama was  trying to potty train you. But of more relevance to sugar arrangements is that you have illustrated one of two approaches to relationships. \n\nThe missing ingredients are an understanding of the mission and value.  \n\nThe wizards of wall street were smug in their financial markets of the 2006 era.  Game Theory flowed from multiple orifices.  They were the masters of the universe, making billions with complex financial transactions that were above mortal understanding. \n\nThey had, they proclaimed, repealed the laws of financial physics. I worked with them as part of my role as an adjunct faculty gig helping to organize several public programs on securitized finance.  \n\nThere was also a young grad student who also looked at the same financial markets, all the synthetic vehicles   and the fundamentals. He carefully traced the path from the homeowner getting a loan to the securitization, to the financial vehicles created by the banks and wall street to the bets placed for and against them. \n\nHis well researched analysis was that the housing finance market and the banking industry  were going to collapse with catastrophic global consequences. He was having difficulty raising capital for a fund that would bet against the tycoons of Wall Street,  but finally was successful. Unfortunately, unlike prior abuses of the markets, the then administration decided that the Wizards were so important they should not serve  the hard time they deserved. \n\n Only 18 months later the grad student  had, according to The Economist, the highest performing hedge fund in the world while many of the banks were just looking to survive. The masters of the financial universe were crushed along with their clients.  His farewell letter to wall street, published in the WSJ and other national/international journals was a classic. \n\nHe returned from self imposed exile a few  years ago with another well researched , out of the box , idea and strategy.  Today an investment of $1,000 is worth $ 30,000 , throughout ,the investment has been secured with physical ownership and possession of an un-leveraged commodity.  The relevance to sugar is that the primary focus  should be on a methodical analysis of what is  important (creates value)  to you and only then search to find someone whose characteristics best fit your needs with a minimum of conflict areas. \n\n The relevance to Arrangements is finding success through recognition of value rather than playing with game theory.  There's also the matter of the allowance you deliver and the way you treat an SB will eventually be reflected in her relationship with you. \n\n It is a lesson far too many SD fail to learn until  the have suffered from the  \"allowance is everything\" SB sticking and the quality, broader relationship seeking SB's having disappeared into the arms of an SD who understood value in a relationship and that relationships seldom flower when they are not mutually beneficial.\n\nI regret that I have no interest in another Porsche",

Again, we will never know because this whole thing only lasted 15 minutes.\n\nThe use of the word \"imagine\" in this line is telling: \"Imagine expecting hours of texting with a woman you\u2019ve never met or given anything to ....that doesn\u2019t make you a SD, it makes you a user trying to take advantage of someone.\"\n\nIn fact, in this case it was OP doing the imagining.  Maybe she was right, but maybe not.\n\nFinal note: OP's profile asks for Amazon gifts in exchange for \\_Reddit DMs\\_.\\*\\* This is not sugar in the SLF sense. \n\n\\*\"unless he\u2019s being as generous with his resources as I am with my texting time\"\n\n\\*\\*\"No DMs for chats unless you\u2019re ready to buy me a treat! \"",

It isn't at ALL about games/gamers.  \"\n\nI do appreciate the advice.  However, I was studying game theory at a well known eastern business school around the time yo mama was  trying to potty train you. But of more relevance to sugar arrangements is that you have illustrated one of two approaches to relationships. \n\nThe missing ingredients are an understanding of the mission and value.  \n\nThe wizards of wall street were smug in their financial markets of the 2006 era.  Game Theory flowed from multiple orifices.  They were the masters of the universe, making billions with complex financial transactions that were above mortal understanding. \n\nThey had, they proclaimed, repealed the laws of financial physics. I worked with them as part of my role as an adjunct faculty gig helping to organize several public programs on securitized finance.  \n\nThere was also a young grad student who also looked at the same financial markets, all the synthetic vehicles   and the fundamentals. He carefully traced the path from the homeowner getting a loan to the securitization, to the financial vehicles created by the banks and wall street to the bets placed for and against them. \n\nHis well researched analysis was that the housing finance market and the banking industry  were going to collapse with catastrophic global consequences. He was having difficulty raising capital for a fund that would bet against the tycoons of Wall Street,  but finally was successful. Unfortunately, unlike prior abuses of the markets, the then administration decided that the Wizards were so important they should not serve  the hard time they deserved. \n\n Only 18 months later the grad student  had, according to The Economist, the highest performing hedge fund in the world while many of the banks were just looking to survive. The masters of the financial universe were crushed along with their clients.  His farewell letter to wall street, published in the WSJ and other national/international journals was a classic. \n\nHe returned from self imposed exile a few  years ago with another well researched , out of the box , idea and strategy.  Today an investment of $1,000 is worth $ 30,000 , throughout ,the investment has been secured with physical ownership and possession of an un-leveraged commodity.  The relevance to sugar is that the primary focus  should be on a methodical analysis of what is  important (creates value)  to you and only then search to find someone whose characteristics best fit your needs with a minimum of conflict areas. \n\n The relevance to Arrangements is finding success through recognition of value rather than playing with game theory.  There's also the matter of the allowance you deliver and the way you treat an SB will eventually be reflected in her relationship with you. \n\n It is a lesson far too many SD fail to learn until  the have suffered from the  \"allowance is everything\" SB sticking and the quality, broader relationship seeking SB's having disappeared into the arms of an SD who understood value in a relationship and that relationships seldom flower when they are not mutually beneficial.\n\nI regret that I have no interest in another Porsche",

Again, we will never know because this whole thing only lasted 15 minutes.\n\nThe use of the word \"imagine\" in this line is telling: \"Imagine expecting hours of texting with a woman you\u2019ve never met or given anything to ....that doesn\u2019t make you a SD, it makes you a user trying to take advantage of someone.\"\n\nIn fact, in this case it was OP doing the imagining.  Maybe she was right, but maybe not.\n\nFinal note: OP's profile asks for Amazon gifts in exchange for \\_Reddit DMs\\_.\\*\\* This is not sugar in the SLF sense. \n\n\\*\"unless he\u2019s being as generous with his resources as I am with my texting time\"\n\n\\*\\*\"No DMs for chats unless you\u2019re ready to buy me a treat! \"",

It isn't at ALL about games/gamers.  \"\n\nI do appreciate the advice.  However, I was studying game theory at a well known eastern business school around the time yo mama was  trying to potty train you. But of more relevance to sugar arrangements is that you have illustrated one of two approaches to relationships. \n\nThe missing ingredients are an understanding of the mission and value.  \n\nThe wizards of wall street were smug in their financial markets of the 2006 era.  Game Theory flowed from multiple orifices.  They were the masters of the universe, making billions with complex financial transactions that were above mortal understanding. \n\nThey had, they proclaimed, repealed the laws of financial physics. I worked with them as part of my role as an adjunct faculty gig helping to organize several public programs on securitized finance.  \n\nThere was also a young grad student who also looked at the same financial markets, all the synthetic vehicles   and the fundamentals. He carefully traced the path from the homeowner getting a loan to the securitization, to the financial vehicles created by the banks and wall street to the bets placed for and against them. \n\nHis well researched analysis was that the housing finance market and the banking industry  were going to collapse with catastrophic global consequences. He was having difficulty raising capital for a fund that would bet against the tycoons of Wall Street,  but finally was successful. Unfortunately, unlike prior abuses of the markets, the then administration decided that the Wizards were so important they should not serve  the hard time they deserved. \n\n Only 18 months later the grad student  had, according to The Economist, the highest performing hedge fund in the world while many of the banks were just looking to survive. The masters of the financial universe were crushed along with their clients.  His farewell letter to wall street, published in the WSJ and other national/international journals was a classic. \n\nHe returned from self imposed exile a few  years ago with another well researched , out of the box , idea and strategy.  Today an investment of $1,000 is worth $ 30,000 , throughout ,the investment has been secured with physical ownership and possession of an un-leveraged commodity.  The relevance to sugar is that the primary focus  should be on a methodical analysis of what is  important (creates value)  to you and only then search to find someone whose characteristics best fit your needs with a minimum of conflict areas. \n\n The relevance to Arrangements is finding success through recognition of value rather than playing with game theory.  There's also the matter of the allowance you deliver and the way you treat an SB will eventually be reflected in her relationship with you. \n\n It is a lesson far too many SD fail to learn until  the have suffered from the  \"allowance is everything\" SB sticking and the quality, broader relationship seeking SB's having disappeared into the arms of an SD who understood value in a relationship and that relationships seldom flower when they are not mutually beneficial.\n\nI regret that I have no interest in another Porsche",

Again, we will never know because this whole thing only lasted 15 minutes.\n\nThe use of the word \"imagine\" in this line is telling: \"Imagine expecting hours of texting with a woman you\u2019ve never met or given anything to ....that doesn\u2019t make you a SD, it makes you a user trying to take advantage of someone.\"\n\nIn fact, in this case it was OP doing the imagining.  Maybe she was right, but maybe not.\n\nFinal note: OP's profile asks for Amazon gifts in exchange for \\_Reddit DMs\\_.\\*\\* This is not sugar in the SLF sense. \n\n\\*\"unless he\u2019s being as generous with his resources as I am with my texting time\"\n\n\\*\\*\"No DMs for chats unless you\u2019re ready to buy me a treat! \"",

Again, we will never know because this whole thing only lasted 15 minutes.\n\nThe use of the word \"imagine\" in this line is telling: \"Imagine expecting hours of texting with a woman you\u2019ve never met or given anything to ....that doesn\u2019t make you a SD, it makes you a user trying to take advantage of someone.\"\n\nIn fact, in this case it was OP doing the imagining.  Maybe she was right, but maybe not.\n\nFinal note: OP's profile asks for Amazon gifts in exchange for \\_Reddit DMs\\_.\\*\\* This is not sugar in the SLF sense. \n\n\\*\"unless he\u2019s being as generous with his resources as I am with my texting time\"\n\n\\*\\*\"No DMs for chats unless you\u2019re ready to buy me a treat! \"",
