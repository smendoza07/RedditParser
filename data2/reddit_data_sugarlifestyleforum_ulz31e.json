    "body": "I never ever ever ask for a m&g fee, but I\u2019m going to be honest (and hopefully I don\u2019t send this sub into shambles again): If I don\u2019t get a gift at the M&G, then I don\u2019t consider the guy a real SD, and I cut off all communication. Some years back, it used to be standard for a man to give you a gift at the M&G, but I feel like men have 1) gotten lazy, and 2) began to fetishize sugaring, so they want to get their rocks off, but can\u2019t really afford it.\n\nEdit: I'm trying to respond to everyone's comments because I think this is a good thread for women that are thinking about sugaring or new to the bowl! If you keep commenting on this thread and I'm not responding, there's probably a reason, DO NOT pm me. I will block you.",

Because that is the tactic too often used by rinsers and scammers. \n\nBut if the M&G goes well and I'm interested, I will absolutely give a gift. Even if the SB doesn't make it a hard-and-fast rule like OP, I still want to stand out among her POTs and show her I'm serious. \n\nSo, fully supportive of SBs who take no gift as a sign that she should prioritize other SDs.",

Its not truly a gift. its a payment for services. Just as people used to \"gift\" a dispensary their payment for MJ when that whole thing started. A lot of woman look as if they've exchanged a service for that money, hence why they dont feel the need to thank you. Does a movie theater, band, or grocery store call and thank you after you spent your money there? Does a prostitute? As much as you want to think of this as a genuine connection, and the wording around sugaring implies that, its not the same thing. Sadly, if money wasnt involved, would these same females date you? Theyre looking for financial compensation before looking for the person.\n\nAnd then when they find you... sounds like they bail  a lot within the first couple months. Maybe is there a personal reason to that?\n\nI just feel like youre going to be constantly disappointed your whole life due to your expectations in this lifestyle. You deserve something more suited to your interests & aspirations. I just feel you're looking in the wrong place, and all the wordage of this lifestyle and \"pretty personalities\" ladies will put up  for the money (despite in their head not truly liking the person or their company), has led you to feel you'll find what you're looking for here.

All my longer SR started with gas or uber money only, no additional gifts. That\u2019s because i experienced a genuine connection with these women and we had organic chemistry too. They were excited to start the arrangement and as things progressed and they proved their worthy to me by their efforts, they were rewarded accordingly. I have no desire to reward someone entitled that feels like they deserve something for just showing up. That\u2019s just delusional entitlement.

I have changed my meet and greet methodology so that instead of giving a gift at the meet and greet itself, I send something electronically later that night or the next day, as long as whoever I went out with has performed some type of follow-up communication. so, I would suggest not cutting a guy off until after you have sent a follow-up text saying thank you for the date and if you are interested in seeing him expressing that you are. if after doing that there is still no type of gift that comes, then you can break off contact.\n\n1. in a similar fashion to your method, I have experienced a one-to-one correlation between good SRs and meet and greets that included a kiss either during the date or at the end of the date. a decently passionate goodnight kiss (not just a peck on the cheek, or quick lip touch) is a strong signal that there is attraction, and that the attraction isn't solely based on how much money is being offered. An e-gift card will be on its way pretty quickly after that M&G. (additional tip: be sure to bring up something during the conversation that he can apply generosity towards, or just mention your Amazon addiction.)",

Its not truly a gift. its a payment for services. Just as people used to \"gift\" a dispensary their payment for MJ when that whole thing started.

Does a movie theater, band, or grocery store call and thank you after you spent your money there? Does a prostitute? As much as you want to think of this as a genuine connection, and the wording around sugaring implies that, its not the same thing. Sadly, if money wasnt involved, would these same females date you? Theyre looking for financial compensation before looking for the person.\n\nAnd then when they find you... sounds like they bail  a lot within the first couple months. Maybe is there a personal reason to that?\n\nI just feel like youre going to be constantly disappointed your whole life due to your expectations in this lifestyle. You deserve something more suited to your interests & aspirations.

All my longer SR started with gas or uber money only, no additional gifts. That\u2019s because i experienced a genuine connection with these women and we had organic chemistry too. They were excited to start the arrangement and as things progressed and they proved their worthy to me by their efforts, they were rewarded accordingly. I have no desire to reward someone entitled that feels like they deserve something for just showing up. That\u2019s just delusional entitlement.

The reason we want it to be unspoken is because we want it to be a complete bonus even if we do it every time. \nHaving someone mention it afterwards means that it wasn't a bonus and it very much was expected even if not mentioned beforehand. Even if she would not next me, I would next her at that stage as I am extremely generous in all regards once a relationship starts.",

You deserve something more suited to your interests & aspirations.

All my longer SR started with gas or uber money only, no additional gifts. That\u2019s because i experienced a genuine connection with these women and we had organic chemistry too. They were excited to start the arrangement and as things progressed and they proved their worthy to me by their efforts, they were rewarded accordingly. I have no desire to reward someone entitled that feels like they deserve something for just showing up. That\u2019s just delusional entitlement. Real Men spoil women we intimately date, we don\u2019t simp for them and try to buy their affection prior to being in an intimate relationship with them",

Its not truly a gift. its a payment for services. Just as people used to \"gift\" a dispensary their payment for MJ when that whole thing started. A lot of woman look as if they've exchanged a service for that money, hence why they dont feel the need to thank you. Does a movie theater, band, or grocery store call and thank you after you spent your money there? Does a prostitute? As much as you want to think of this as a genuine connection, and the wording around sugaring implies that, its not the same thing. Sadly, if money wasnt involved, would these same females date you? Theyre looking for financial compensation before looking for the person.\n\nAnd then when they find you... sounds like they bail  a lot within the first couple months. Maybe is there a personal reason to that?\n\nI just feel like youre going to be constantly disappointed your whole life due to your expectations in this lifestyle. You deserve something more suited to your interests & aspirations. I just feel you're looking in the wrong place, and all the wordage of this lifestyle and \"pretty personalities\" ladies will put up  for the money (despite in their head not truly liking the person or their company), has led you to feel you'll find what you're looking for here.

All my longer SR started with gas or uber money only, no additional gifts. That\u2019s because i experienced a genuine connection with these women and we had organic chemistry too. They were excited to start the arrangement and as things progressed and they proved their worthy to me by their efforts, they were rewarded accordingly. I have no desire to reward someone entitled that feels like they deserve something for just showing up. That\u2019s just delusional entitlement. Real Men spoil women we intimately date, we don\u2019t simp for them and try to buy their affection prior to being in an intimate relationship with them",

All my longer SR started with gas or uber money only, no additional gifts. That\u2019s because i experienced a genuine connection with these women and we had organic chemistry too. They were excited to start the arrangement and as things progressed and they proved their worthy to me by their efforts, they were rewarded accordingly. I have no desire to reward someone entitled that feels like they deserve something for just showing up. That\u2019s just delusional entitlement. Real Men spoil women we intimately date, we don\u2019t simp for them and try to buy their affection prior to being in an intimate relationship with them",
