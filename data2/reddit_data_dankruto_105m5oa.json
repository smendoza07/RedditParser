It passing Shikamaru's view and him realising Choji wasn't going to catch up with them like he said.    \n- The butterfly landing on his stationary body resting against a tree with the sun shining on him.    \n\nBy all rights in writing, he was super dead. \n\nNothing against his character (not that he had a whole lot going on before that fight) but it'd make the story a lot more interesting if there were consequences to the Sasuke Retrieval mission.",
