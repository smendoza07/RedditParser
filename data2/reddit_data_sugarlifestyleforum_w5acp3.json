    "body": "Sigh! Following on from my last post it seemed a lot of people were upset by the fact I had an SD that was married. So much so I've been getting a lot of hate in my dm's. Heck I even got follows from people from r/cheaters forums and such like. I can't get back to all of you hence this post \ud83d\ude18\n\n1. I'm not going to stop seeing him lol he may be an awful husband, but a fantastic SD . Your moral standing is not going to affect me, thanks though \n2. Yes I've accepted the reality of what it is. I'll leave when it runs its course and ends (as do all SR's) \n3. Many SDs that offer my desired allowance are married. If you are not ok with that go for the single ones (though many lie about their marital status)\n4. Thanks everyone else for your advice \u2665\ufe0f",

I especially enjoyed the hypocrisy of the fury at that SB who was married -- evidently some think married SD is fine but for some reason not SB?\n\nIt may be the case that we're under a little mini invasion -- we've had previous episodes with what seemed to be coordinated entry of people from infidelity subs, and I suspect that's happening right now, based on some patterns we're seeing as mods the past few days.  Just FYI, I didn't see your earlier thread, but it might not be the slf community at work here",

Some men are inclined to have and hold a single partner and some are not, due to the amount of copies of this gene (among other factors I\u2019m sure). The science of love and sex isn\u2019t always romantic but it does offer insight as to why we are attracted to certain people. So, it\u2019s highly likely that even if the man did not cheat with you, he would have cheated anyway. Also, I see a lot of women (also men but I don\u2019t interact with them as often) who simply decide to stop having sex with their partner. Is a spouse supposed to just give up sex forever?! I think every person has to make this choice on their own. I\u2019m not blaming anyone. But whoever is attacking you probably needs a better hobby and to start researching why it is a fear they have or what the brain responds to scientifically.

Or perhaps you do! This isn\u2019t coming from a place of judgement. I am simply curious why a man would need outside sources to fill gaps but a woman would not. It seems that if both are getting unmet needs filled than the relationship as a whole would improve 2x\u2019s over. For example, if your wife is younger, she may wish to connect with a man who can understand her generation/pop culture better. Similar to you wanting to feel alive and desired by a younger woman. If your wife has an SR of her own, than maybe the outcome would be even better than now!",

This isn\u2019t coming from a place of judgement. I am simply curious why a man would need outside sources to fill gaps but a woman would not. It seems that if both are getting unmet needs filled than the relationship as a whole would improve 2x\u2019s over. For example, if your wife is younger, she may wish to connect with a man who can understand her generation/pop culture better. Similar to you wanting to feel alive and desired by a younger woman. If your wife has an SR of her own, than maybe the outcome would be even better than now!",

I think older women need this too, its just different in how they go about it.\n\nCuriously my wife did have a SR of her own before I knew her well and she was quite invigorated by it, but it was not sustained once we got married.

This isn\u2019t coming from a place of judgement. I am simply curious why a man would need outside sources to fill gaps but a woman would not. It seems that if both are getting unmet needs filled than the relationship as a whole would improve 2x\u2019s over. For example, if your wife is younger, she may wish to connect with a man who can understand her generation/pop culture better. Similar to you wanting to feel alive and desired by a younger woman. If your wife has an SR of her own, than maybe the outcome would be even better than now!",

The \u201cmissing parts\u201d aren't really missing they are just new and exciting. Its like having a muse. Sometimes you need someone young or different to expand your own horizons. I think older women need this too, its just different in how they go about it.\n\nCuriously my wife did have a SR of her own before I knew her well and she was quite invigorated by it, but it was not sustained once we got married. Today it would be awkward because I don't really swing that way, but the inverse may not be as true.",

My questions are:\nDoes your wife know? And if not, why wouldn\u2019t you encourage her to seek out the \u201cmissing parts\u201d in her own SRs? Or perhaps you do! This isn\u2019t coming from a place of judgement. I am simply curious why a man would need outside sources to fill gaps but a woman would not. It seems that if both are getting unmet needs filled than the relationship as a whole would improve 2x\u2019s over. For example, if your wife is younger, she may wish to connect with a man who can understand her generation/pop culture better. Similar to you wanting to feel alive and desired by a younger woman. If your wife has an SR of her own, than maybe the outcome would be even better than now!",

The \u201cmissing parts\u201d aren't really missing they are just new and exciting. Its like having a muse. Sometimes you need someone young or different to expand your own horizons. I think older women need this too, its just different in how they go about it.\n\nCuriously my wife did have a SR of her own before I knew her well and she was quite invigorated by it, but it was not sustained once we got married. Today it would be awkward because I don't really swing that way, but the inverse may not be as true.",

My questions are:\nDoes your wife know? And if not, why wouldn\u2019t you encourage her to seek out the \u201cmissing parts\u201d in her own SRs? Or perhaps you do! This isn\u2019t coming from a place of judgement. I am simply curious why a man would need outside sources to fill gaps but a woman would not. It seems that if both are getting unmet needs filled than the relationship as a whole would improve 2x\u2019s over. For example, if your wife is younger, she may wish to connect with a man who can understand her generation/pop culture better. Similar to you wanting to feel alive and desired by a younger woman. If your wife has an SR of her own, than maybe the outcome would be even better than now!",

The \u201cmissing parts\u201d aren't really missing they are just new and exciting. Its like having a muse. Sometimes you need someone young or different to expand your own horizons. I think older women need this too, its just different in how they go about it.\n\nCuriously my wife did have a SR of her own before I knew her well and she was quite invigorated by it, but it was not sustained once we got married. Today it would be awkward because I don't really swing that way, but the inverse may not be as true.",
