Hoping I can finally get some advice. Are there even any barbers or stylists subbed here? \n\nThe mods have practically fucked off. One of the current mods hasn't been here for 10 months! Why the fuck even bother? \n\n**Fuck this sub!** \n\nIt's filled to the brim with balding cuntfucks with nothing better to do than circlejerk their favorite pictures of shirtless male models and downvote real posters who come here for actual hair help.

I see 155 people viewing this sub right now, and most are probably clicking sidebar links, or wanting to ask their own question.  Then when questions are asked; they can be broken down to the same questions over and over....\n\n1)  The vague \" I'm looking to change it up, what should I do?\"  - Most people here aren't in the position to answer this because they, themselves, are looking for advice.  Stylist HATE this question, because they know NOTHING about you.  If you want advice; search for hair styles and post a pic of it and one of you; then ask if you can pull it off.  \n\n2) \"I want this haircut, what do I tell my barber?\" - attaches photo.   There are many ways to interpret styles...3 barbers might do an undercut 3 different ways...Just show them the photo.\n\n3) \"What's my face shape? What hairstlyes for my face shape?\"  This can be answered in the sidebar\n\n4) \"How should I style/cut my hair?\" - attaches photo of themselves with hair 1\" long.  Short hair doesn't give you much to work with. \n\n5) \"What products to achieve this look?\"  - attaches photo of model that's been asked about 2 weeks earlier.. Don't ask this because the response from this sub will almost-certainly be Hanz De Fuko Claymation.  It's like the duct-tape for hair....use the guide in the sidebar to learn about different products and how to apply.  Or ask questions about a specific product you might be interested in.\n\nI'm sure there a few i'm missing, but you get the idea.   \n\nedit:  I just want to add, i've seen good threads going on in this sub.  It's not SHIT, it's just small.",
