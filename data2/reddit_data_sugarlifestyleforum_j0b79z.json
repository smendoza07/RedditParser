    "body": "*RED FLAG - MEN UNDER 30* \nOkay so this is just me on a rant. \n\nWent on a date with a 25 year old seeking guy. \nGot along amazingly, chat was flowing and drinks where pouring. Then 2 hours passed and he\u2019s going on and on about going back to his house and chilling. \n\nAt first I was hesitant cause I know that\u2019s a no no. But he was taking about just chillin, so I was like okay let\u2019s suss him out. \nSo I told him \u201cI\u2019m not sure what your intentions are, but I have to just warn you that I\u2019m on my time of the month\u201d...\nHis personality, his vibe and everything dropped. \nHe was like \u201coh okay we should leave it\u201d\n\nHe was basically just trying to use me for you know what. \nWe had no allowance planned, but he was promising that he knows what the site is about and \u201cnot to worry, I\u2019ve got you\u201d. Maybe next time. \n\nI texted him after to suss him out again. \nI aaid \u201chope to make plans next week when everything\u2019s normal\u201d and did he reply? \nAbsolutely not!  \n\nSuch an eye opener cause that could\u2019ve gone so bad. \nLadies, don\u2019t feel pressured to go to his place. Take that as a huge red flag!! \nAlso, establish that you would like to plan an allowance BEFORE meeting. This is where I\u2019m going wrong and  wasting my own time.",

He is paying an allowance to avoid all that.   His questions should be about you rather than boasting to a younger girl,  real SD\u2019s don\u2019t do that.  Unless the situation is a complete outlier (long distance and have been talking awhile and he has spent money on you) then NEVER get intimate on the first meeting.  Set the tone for a real,  long term arrangement.  Girls that operate with class and have healthy boundaries up front will do much better in the long run.   They will turn off the predators and attract the top tier SD\u2019s.",

She actually did come back to my place after the meet & greet, but this was at her suggestion.\n\nTypically I look for more of a sugar girlfriend type relationship which is a hybrid of vanilla and sugar, where you offer financial help, but it's not like PPM tied to intimate dates, its more like vanilla dating w/ financial help. I just figure this is par for the course seeing Im almost 50, and date women 21-25.",
