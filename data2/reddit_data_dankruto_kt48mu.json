He finished his story in Shippuden, leave him alone. \n\nInstead of following his kid, they should have created new characters in one of the other villages and followed them. You\u2019d still get to see the after effects of Shippuden, but we get to see it through a different perspective. Sure, Naruto could cameo if the Hokage from the leaf village had to come visit for some reason, but following him specifically and his kids just leaves me so uninterested",

I understand that at the end of boruto shippuden he\u2019ll be stronger than his dad. And I\u2019m not opposed to it, but goddamn is boruto so powerful. Like the whole entire series of naruto is that hardships make you stronger. Yet boruto hasn\u2019t done any hard ships and when he graduates he already has a master in shadow clone and has Avery strong taijutsu that\u2019s a mix of frog Kata and Gentle fist. He Strait up is already Jonin tier and that\u2019s not including his eye ball and other jutsus.\n\n\nAnd sasuke is made out to be this amazingly strong person (fine with it) yet naruto who was way way stronger than sasuke just hasn\u2019t improved one bit (like no new jutsus, strategies, or just techniques) yet sasuke has like 700 more jutsus and techniques. While literally like a few months out of the academy boruto already reinvented the rasenshurieken.

Well firstly I suppose there's the fact Naruto and Sasuke have been/are getting nerfed, but it's something else. It's the Jougan and the Karma/Momoshiki nonsense.\n\nIn the original Naruto series, we straight away see the Nine Tails, and we know that it's sealed in Naruto and we over the course of the series learn that he can learn to control it (which he eventually does), and then Naruto gets additional powers from the Sage of Six Paths (and then he loses some? idk I'm still not clear on what powers he lost. honestly he should have just been allowed to keep everything) and while that may seem ass-pully, the Sage of Six Paths is someone we learn about before, so it's not too farfetched. This makes Naruto one of the strongest ninja alive.\n\nSo, Boruto (technically) has to surpass Naruto. How does he do it? Well first of all there's the Jougan, which he gets from Toneri. Now this is so god damn dumb. Toneri first appeared in The Last: Naruto The Movie, and in that movie he was Naruto's enemy, and upon being defeated, said he'd make sure the moon (and so he) never come close to the Earth again (or something like that). And then what does he do? Around the time that Boruto starts at the academy, he gives him a new special OP eye, and then doesn't tell anyone about it. Like if Naruto and Hinata knew where it came from, they'd be pretty god damn pissed I imagine. I mean why wouldn't they? An alien they fought against just snuck a conversation with their 7 year old son and fucked with his eyes.\n\nAnd then, there's the Karma/Momoshiki stuff. So you're telling me that during Boruto's short fight against Momoshiki, he was able to quickly put a weird seal on his body that allows him to take control and for Boruto's body to do some weird shit? Nah, this is way too ass pully for me. Both of these things are so dumb.\n\nAnd then yeah, as others have mentioned, now there's new conflict in the world. But if you remember in Naruto, Jiraiya's mission was to find the Child of Prophecy, the one who would either bring destruction or peace to the world. Eventually, Naruto found out about all this, and learnt that he was the child of prophecy, and so as we know, he won the Fourth Great Ninja War and brought peace to the world.\n\nBut then Boruto exists, and new big conflicts arise. Which means Naruto failed. Naruto is the Child of Prophecy, he took on a mission passed down to him from Jiraiya, Nagato and Minato...and now that there's these new threats in the world, and bad things are gonna happen in the future...that means Naruto ultimately failed in his mission as the Child of Prophecy. Or at the very least, there was no meaning to that prophecy, if one day his son was just gonna get some OP powers from bullshit sources and surpass him to save the world",

It's not like he could teach her the same exact technique. In fact, Madara calls it an \"imitation\" of Hashirama's technique to mock her. If a watered down imitation can shorten lifespans, I believe a more potent one could too. \n\nIt also explains why Tsunade is still alive even in Boruto while Hashirama died much younger. It was watered down and she didn't use it as much. \n\nThis is just the best theory I got. The only other explanation is a mysterious illness like Itachi which *could* be true since I doubt they had the best medical care back then.",

That could've lead to more world building around the smaller nations, and just showcasing that fighting is just human nature. They could've also shown us newer unique ninja. I don't care of their kids of the original konoha 11, they just have to be different from their parents. They could've had to Otsutsuki threat be slowly built up and become a full threat later.

I don't think I need to go over both Ino-Shika-Chos (in Naruto). Neji, his father, and his uncle??? Rock Lee and Guy Sensei aren't even fucking related as well yet look at those clowns. \n\nLike seriously, NOW? Now is when you guys are starting to take a piss at lazy character design?

I was saying that the children in Boruto are like human children in that sense, because that's literally what the fuck they are. I can call back to reality if I want to. It wouldn't work the other way around given that Naruto is fictional, but I can call back to a phenomenon that happens in the real world because it's clearly applicable and demonstrated in the show. I'm the one who's correct here, not you. \n\nAre you gonna find it happen in the real world as many times as it happens in Naruto? No probably not. \n\nBut is it possible? Fuck yeah it is. If complete and total realism is what you're looking for in a series like Naruto or Boruto, then you're the one with the weak argument anyways, not me.\n\n> pretty bad defense of Boruto\n\nNot defending Boruto, just asking for some fucking consistency from you people instead of y'all being on here acting like such boomer tards always saying shit like \"Boruto bad, Naruto good, now give me upvotes\".

Instead of wars, we get threats from individuals or small groups. Just like the terrorists in real life. You may not have to go to war but there is still the danger of people who were raised wrong, or developed the deviancy due to other bad influences. It focuses on the corruption of the mind. Lastly the Otsutsuki or however it may be spelled, are boring by themselves but they indirectly make things interesting because of the pressure they apply to the villages to defend themselves. It allows for arcs like the Ohnoki arc.",

It's sooooooo much better on binge, just like the War Arc of Naruto.\n\nThere is still crappy filler, but once you get the pace ramped up a bit the cheap crap starts fading out and you get what the ideas behind stuff was. A lot of parallels I missed before become apparent, and from that the contrasts that make it interesting. Still not great, but like the good Naruto filler.\n\nAnd Boruto is actually an okay person now, which goes a looooong way.\n\nI'd say there are already parts of Boruto I like better than certain parts of Naruto, even through the nostalgia goggles for the latter.\n\nJust waiting on the peaks to be comparable.",

Villains in Naruto were one of the best things. They were relatable, had their motives and we could've cheered for them to an extent. It isn't the case with the otsutsuki. Maybe they have something coming with Isshiki but the other guys were uninspiring. Besides that - the power levels reached by Naruto and Sasuke made it simply impossible to make Boruto a lead character with the writer deciding that the bad guys will be stronger than ever. It is hardly justifiable and makes the series feel wrong, forcing the writers to display Naruto and Sasuke like some sissies at times (making Sasuke go out of chakra all the time, etc.) for no actual reason. Oh, and I won't even talk about shit like Sasuke who was willing to recreate his clan making only one child of his own, who, in addition, is a woman who will not carry his name. This is just plain bad writing.",

Orochimaru now represents the dilemma between acquiring knowledge for the sake of development and the immoral things one may have to do to acquire it and gave us Mitsuki who suffers due to that and needs to find his will. You guys are so conservative sometimes talking about how some characters changed for the worse but then cry when the children are mere carbon copies of the previous generation (which sarada and boruto at least aren't). Make up your mind and maybe try to see the positives in the changes made or the positives of sometimes keeping with the original and not changing a thing.",

Otherwise, seems kinda redundant",

Every new character just getting stronger and stronger isn\u2019t interesting, it\u2019s boring.",

I understand that at the end of boruto shippuden he\u2019ll be stronger than his dad. And I\u2019m not opposed to it, but goddamn is boruto so powerful. Like the whole entire series of naruto is that hardships make you stronger. Yet boruto hasn\u2019t done any hard ships and when he graduates he already has a master in shadow clone and has Avery strong taijutsu that\u2019s a mix of frog Kata and Gentle fist. He Strait up is already Jonin tier and that\u2019s not including his eye ball and other jutsus.\n\n\nAnd sasuke is made out to be this amazingly strong person (fine with it) yet naruto who was way way stronger than sasuke just hasn\u2019t improved one bit (like no new jutsus, strategies, or just techniques) yet sasuke has like 700 more jutsus and techniques. While literally like a few months out of the academy boruto already reinvented the rasenshurieken. Yet he hasn\u2019t worked for it. \n\n\nNot even gonna get started on the fact naruto is a horrible parent",

Well firstly I suppose there's the fact Naruto and Sasuke have been/are getting nerfed, but it's something else. It's the Jougan and the Karma/Momoshiki nonsense.\n\nIn the original Naruto series, we straight away see the Nine Tails, and we know that it's sealed in Naruto and we over the course of the series learn that he can learn to control it (which he eventually does), and then Naruto gets additional powers from the Sage of Six Paths (and then he loses some? idk I'm still not clear on what powers he lost. honestly he should have just been allowed to keep everything) and while that may seem ass-pully, the Sage of Six Paths is someone we learn about before, so it's not too farfetched. This makes Naruto one of the strongest ninja alive.\n\nSo, Boruto (technically) has to surpass Naruto. How does he do it? Well first of all there's the Jougan, which he gets from Toneri. Now this is so god damn dumb. Toneri first appeared in The Last: Naruto The Movie, and in that movie he was Naruto's enemy, and upon being defeated, said he'd make sure the moon (and so he) never come close to the Earth again (or something like that). And then what does he do? Around the time that Boruto starts at the academy, he gives him a new special OP eye, and then doesn't tell anyone about it. Like if Naruto and Hinata knew where it came from, they'd be pretty god damn pissed I imagine. I mean why wouldn't they? An alien they fought against just snuck a conversation with their 7 year old son and fucked with his eyes.\n\nAnd then, there's the Karma/Momoshiki stuff. So you're telling me that during Boruto's short fight against Momoshiki, he was able to quickly put a weird seal on his body that allows him to take control and for Boruto's body to do some weird shit? Nah, this is way too ass pully for me. Both of these things are so dumb.\n\nAnd then yeah, as others have mentioned, now there's new conflict in the world. But if you remember in Naruto, Jiraiya's mission was to find the Child of Prophecy, the one who would either bring destruction or peace to the world. Eventually, Naruto found out about all this, and learnt that he was the child of prophecy, and so as we know, he won the Fourth Great Ninja War and brought peace to the world.\n\nBut then Boruto exists, and new big conflicts arise. Which means Naruto failed. Naruto is the Child of Prophecy, he took on a mission passed down to him from Jiraiya, Nagato and Minato...and now that there's these new threats in the world, and bad things are gonna happen in the future...that means Naruto ultimately failed in his mission as the Child of Prophecy. Or at the very least, there was no meaning to that prophecy, if one day his son was just gonna get some OP powers from bullshit sources and surpass him to save the world",

They could've made it like a young boy, trying to make himself known as an individual rather then the son of the most powerful ninja in all of history.

That could've lead to more world building around the smaller nations, and just showcasing that fighting is just human nature. They could've also shown us newer unique ninja. I don't care of their kids of the original konoha 11, they just have to be different from their parents. They could've had to Otsutsuki threat be slowly built up and become a full threat later. Boruto had potential, it was just ruined by lousy writing",

That's all I'm saying. \n\nAnd yes, I'm aware that children's shows can have good writing, but that's not why I brought it up as a point. \n\nIf something is a children's show, that doesn't mean that it **can't** have good writing, it means you're a little bit silly if you're **expecting** it to have good writing because frankly kids don't care about that shit. \n\nSpending time and money to come up with a better story, when you can always dump out a bad story and still get hella paid is not a smart business move, and they know that.\n\nYou're not gonna like hearing this, but Naruto's legacy is over my friend.

Instead of wars, we get threats from individuals or small groups. Just like the terrorists in real life. You may not have to go to war but there is still the danger of people who were raised wrong, or developed the deviancy due to other bad influences. It focuses on the corruption of the mind. Lastly the Otsutsuki or however it may be spelled, are boring by themselves but they indirectly make things interesting because of the pressure they apply to the villages to defend themselves. It allows for arcs like the Ohnoki arc.",

A lot of parallels I missed before become apparent, and from that the contrasts that make it interesting. Still not great, but like the good Naruto filler.\n\nAnd Boruto is actually an okay person now, which goes a looooong way.\n\nI'd say there are already parts of Boruto I like better than certain parts of Naruto, even through the nostalgia goggles for the latter.\n\nJust waiting on the peaks to be comparable.",

As for Orochimaru, it was very foreseeable where Orochimarus character was going if you paid close attention to the end of Naruto, he was helping around and telling Sasuke that he no longer wants to destroy Konoha or be a generic bad villain that was corrupted by wanting to become stronger (which is arguably a boring premise for a villain). Orochimaru now represents the dilemma between acquiring knowledge for the sake of development and the immoral things one may have to do to acquire it and gave us Mitsuki who suffers due to that and needs to find his will. You guys are so conservative sometimes talking about how some characters changed for the worse but then cry when the children are mere carbon copies of the previous generation (which sarada and boruto at least aren't). Make up your mind and maybe try to see the positives in the changes made or the positives of sometimes keeping with the original and not changing a thing.",

                            "body": "I 100% agree with you. My biggest gripe is the fact that everyone in the show is so powerful. I understand that at the end of boruto shippuden he\u2019ll be stronger than his dad. And I\u2019m not opposed to it, but goddamn is boruto so powerful. Like the whole entire series of naruto is that hardships make you stronger. Yet boruto hasn\u2019t done any hard ships and when he graduates he already has a master in shadow clone and has Avery strong taijutsu that\u2019s a mix of frog Kata and Gentle fist. He Strait up is already Jonin tier and that\u2019s not including his eye ball and other jutsus.\n\n\nAnd sasuke is made out to be this amazingly strong person (fine with it) yet naruto who was way way stronger than sasuke just hasn\u2019t improved one bit (like no new jutsus, strategies, or just techniques) yet sasuke has like 700 more jutsus and techniques. While literally like a few months out of the academy boruto already reinvented the rasenshurieken. Yet he hasn\u2019t worked for it. \n\n\nNot even gonna get started on the fact naruto is a horrible parent",

                                    "body": "Along with the stuff you and the others mentioned, I've got another problem.\n\nSo yeah we know obviously Boruto is gonna have to surpass Naruto (as much as that may be a kick in the balls to us fans), but it's the way he's doing it that annoys me. Well firstly I suppose there's the fact Naruto and Sasuke have been/are getting nerfed, but it's something else. It's the Jougan and the Karma/Momoshiki nonsense.\n\nIn the original Naruto series, we straight away see the Nine Tails, and we know that it's sealed in Naruto and we over the course of the series learn that he can learn to control it (which he eventually does), and then Naruto gets additional powers from the Sage of Six Paths (and then he loses some? idk I'm still not clear on what powers he lost. honestly he should have just been allowed to keep everything) and while that may seem ass-pully, the Sage of Six Paths is someone we learn about before, so it's not too farfetched. This makes Naruto one of the strongest ninja alive.\n\nSo, Boruto (technically) has to surpass Naruto. How does he do it? Well first of all there's the Jougan, which he gets from Toneri. Now this is so god damn dumb. Toneri first appeared in The Last: Naruto The Movie, and in that movie he was Naruto's enemy, and upon being defeated, said he'd make sure the moon (and so he) never come close to the Earth again (or something like that). And then what does he do? Around the time that Boruto starts at the academy, he gives him a new special OP eye, and then doesn't tell anyone about it. Like if Naruto and Hinata knew where it came from, they'd be pretty god damn pissed I imagine. I mean why wouldn't they? An alien they fought against just snuck a conversation with their 7 year old son and fucked with his eyes.\n\nAnd then, there's the Karma/Momoshiki stuff. So you're telling me that during Boruto's short fight against Momoshiki, he was able to quickly put a weird seal on his body that allows him to take control and for Boruto's body to do some weird shit? Nah, this is way too ass pully for me. Both of these things are so dumb.\n\nAnd then yeah, as others have mentioned, now there's new conflict in the world. But if you remember in Naruto, Jiraiya's mission was to find the Child of Prophecy, the one who would either bring destruction or peace to the world. Eventually, Naruto found out about all this, and learnt that he was the child of prophecy, and so as we know, he won the Fourth Great Ninja War and brought peace to the world.\n\nBut then Boruto exists, and new big conflicts arise. Which means Naruto failed. Naruto is the Child of Prophecy, he took on a mission passed down to him from Jiraiya, Nagato and Minato...and now that there's these new threats in the world, and bad things are gonna happen in the future...that means Naruto ultimately failed in his mission as the Child of Prophecy. Or at the very least, there was no meaning to that prophecy, if one day his son was just gonna get some OP powers from bullshit sources and surpass him to save the world",

If a watered down imitation can shorten lifespans, I believe a more potent one could too. \n\nIt also explains why Tsunade is still alive even in Boruto while Hashirama died much younger. It was watered down and she didn't use it as much. \n\nThis is just the best theory I got.

It is scientifically proven that even with being a genetic mix between two parents, your physical attributes can be that of only one parent. Same thing goes for personality(personality can be a unique trait you develop on your own, or get from one/both of your parents).\n\nNaruto looks like his dad. As does Kakashi to his father. I don't think I need to go over both Ino-Shika-Chos (in Naruto). Neji, his father, and his uncle??? Rock Lee and Guy Sensei aren't even fucking related as well yet look at those clowns. \n\nLike seriously, NOW? Now is when you guys are starting to take a piss at lazy character design? Or am I being sensible here and smelling a bit of a double standard to just hate on Boruto? You tell me if it's stupid or not u/cayendo-\n\nY'all just don't wanna hear the truth.\n\ud83e\udd14",

I was saying that the children in Boruto are like human children in that sense, because that's literally what the fuck they are. I can call back to reality if I want to. It wouldn't work the other way around given that Naruto is fictional, but I can call back to a phenomenon that happens in the real world because it's clearly applicable and demonstrated in the show. I'm the one who's correct here, not you. \n\nAre you gonna find it happen in the real world as many times as it happens in Naruto? No probably not. \n\nBut is it possible? Fuck yeah it is. If complete and total realism is what you're looking for in a series like Naruto or Boruto, then you're the one with the weak argument anyways, not me.\n\n> pretty bad defense of Boruto\n\nNot defending Boruto, just asking for some fucking consistency from you people instead of y'all being on here acting like such boomer tards always saying shit like \"Boruto bad, Naruto good, now give me upvotes\". I don't even like Boruto that much, and there's definitely way better fucking things to watch. Just be consistent in your criticisms holy shit.\n\nNot going to address anything else you said because that's just opinion, and an interpretation that will differentiate among people.",

As for Orochimaru, it was very foreseeable where Orochimarus character was going if you paid close attention to the end of Naruto, he was helping around and telling Sasuke that he no longer wants to destroy Konoha or be a generic bad villain that was corrupted by wanting to become stronger (which is arguably a boring premise for a villain). Orochimaru now represents the dilemma between acquiring knowledge for the sake of development and the immoral things one may have to do to acquire it and gave us Mitsuki who suffers due to that and needs to find his will. You guys are so conservative sometimes talking about how some characters changed for the worse but then cry when the children are mere carbon copies of the previous generation (which sarada and boruto at least aren't). Make up your mind and maybe try to see the positives in the changes made or the positives of sometimes keeping with the original and not changing a thing.",

He Strait up is already Jonin tier and that\u2019s not including his eye ball and other jutsus.\n\n\nAnd sasuke is made out to be this amazingly strong person (fine with it) yet naruto who was way way stronger than sasuke just hasn\u2019t improved one bit (like no new jutsus, strategies, or just techniques) yet sasuke has like 700 more jutsus and techniques.

                            "body": "Along with the stuff you and the others mentioned, I've got another problem.\n\nSo yeah we know obviously Boruto is gonna have to surpass Naruto (as much as that may be a kick in the balls to us fans), but it's the way he's doing it that annoys me. Well firstly I suppose there's the fact Naruto and Sasuke have been/are getting nerfed, but it's something else. It's the Jougan and the Karma/Momoshiki nonsense.\n\nIn the original Naruto series, we straight away see the Nine Tails, and we know that it's sealed in Naruto and we over the course of the series learn that he can learn to control it (which he eventually does), and then Naruto gets additional powers from the Sage of Six Paths (and then he loses some? idk I'm still not clear on what powers he lost. honestly he should have just been allowed to keep everything) and while that may seem ass-pully, the Sage of Six Paths is someone we learn about before, so it's not too farfetched. This makes Naruto one of the strongest ninja alive.\n\nSo, Boruto (technically) has to surpass Naruto. How does he do it? Well first of all there's the Jougan, which he gets from Toneri. Now this is so god damn dumb. Toneri first appeared in The Last: Naruto The Movie, and in that movie he was Naruto's enemy, and upon being defeated, said he'd make sure the moon (and so he) never come close to the Earth again (or something like that). And then what does he do? Around the time that Boruto starts at the academy, he gives him a new special OP eye, and then doesn't tell anyone about it. Like if Naruto and Hinata knew where it came from, they'd be pretty god damn pissed I imagine. I mean why wouldn't they? An alien they fought against just snuck a conversation with their 7 year old son and fucked with his eyes.\n\nAnd then, there's the Karma/Momoshiki stuff. So you're telling me that during Boruto's short fight against Momoshiki, he was able to quickly put a weird seal on his body that allows him to take control and for Boruto's body to do some weird shit? Nah, this is way too ass pully for me. Both of these things are so dumb.\n\nAnd then yeah, as others have mentioned, now there's new conflict in the world. But if you remember in Naruto, Jiraiya's mission was to find the Child of Prophecy, the one who would either bring destruction or peace to the world. Eventually, Naruto found out about all this, and learnt that he was the child of prophecy, and so as we know, he won the Fourth Great Ninja War and brought peace to the world.\n\nBut then Boruto exists, and new big conflicts arise. Which means Naruto failed. Naruto is the Child of Prophecy, he took on a mission passed down to him from Jiraiya, Nagato and Minato...and now that there's these new threats in the world, and bad things are gonna happen in the future...that means Naruto ultimately failed in his mission as the Child of Prophecy. Or at the very least, there was no meaning to that prophecy, if one day his son was just gonna get some OP powers from bullshit sources and surpass him to save the world",

I understand that at the end of boruto shippuden he\u2019ll be stronger than his dad. And I\u2019m not opposed to it, but goddamn is boruto so powerful. Like the whole entire series of naruto is that hardships make you stronger. Yet boruto hasn\u2019t done any hard ships and when he graduates he already has a master in shadow clone and has Avery strong taijutsu that\u2019s a mix of frog Kata and Gentle fist. He Strait up is already Jonin tier and that\u2019s not including his eye ball and other jutsus.\n\n\nAnd sasuke is made out to be this amazingly strong person (fine with it) yet naruto who was way way stronger than sasuke just hasn\u2019t improved one bit (like no new jutsus, strategies, or just techniques) yet sasuke has like 700 more jutsus and techniques. While literally like a few months out of the academy boruto already reinvented the rasenshurieken. Yet he hasn\u2019t worked for it. \n\n\nNot even gonna get started on the fact naruto is a horrible parent",

                    "body": "Along with the stuff you and the others mentioned, I've got another problem.\n\nSo yeah we know obviously Boruto is gonna have to surpass Naruto (as much as that may be a kick in the balls to us fans), but it's the way he's doing it that annoys me. Well firstly I suppose there's the fact Naruto and Sasuke have been/are getting nerfed, but it's something else. It's the Jougan and the Karma/Momoshiki nonsense.\n\nIn the original Naruto series, we straight away see the Nine Tails, and we know that it's sealed in Naruto and we over the course of the series learn that he can learn to control it (which he eventually does), and then Naruto gets additional powers from the Sage of Six Paths (and then he loses some? idk I'm still not clear on what powers he lost. honestly he should have just been allowed to keep everything) and while that may seem ass-pully, the Sage of Six Paths is someone we learn about before, so it's not too farfetched. This makes Naruto one of the strongest ninja alive.\n\nSo, Boruto (technically) has to surpass Naruto. How does he do it? Well first of all there's the Jougan, which he gets from Toneri. Now this is so god damn dumb. Toneri first appeared in The Last: Naruto The Movie, and in that movie he was Naruto's enemy, and upon being defeated, said he'd make sure the moon (and so he) never come close to the Earth again (or something like that). And then what does he do? Around the time that Boruto starts at the academy, he gives him a new special OP eye, and then doesn't tell anyone about it. Like if Naruto and Hinata knew where it came from, they'd be pretty god damn pissed I imagine. I mean why wouldn't they? An alien they fought against just snuck a conversation with their 7 year old son and fucked with his eyes.\n\nAnd then, there's the Karma/Momoshiki stuff. So you're telling me that during Boruto's short fight against Momoshiki, he was able to quickly put a weird seal on his body that allows him to take control and for Boruto's body to do some weird shit? Nah, this is way too ass pully for me. Both of these things are so dumb.\n\nAnd then yeah, as others have mentioned, now there's new conflict in the world. But if you remember in Naruto, Jiraiya's mission was to find the Child of Prophecy, the one who would either bring destruction or peace to the world. Eventually, Naruto found out about all this, and learnt that he was the child of prophecy, and so as we know, he won the Fourth Great Ninja War and brought peace to the world.\n\nBut then Boruto exists, and new big conflicts arise. Which means Naruto failed. Naruto is the Child of Prophecy, he took on a mission passed down to him from Jiraiya, Nagato and Minato...and now that there's these new threats in the world, and bad things are gonna happen in the future...that means Naruto ultimately failed in his mission as the Child of Prophecy. Or at the very least, there was no meaning to that prophecy, if one day his son was just gonna get some OP powers from bullshit sources and surpass him to save the world",

Who else could rival him and kill him, the guy with healing even greater than Tsunade, along with all his other jutsu and Sage Mode? \n\nDuring the 5 Kage vs Madara fight, Madara says that Hashirama's healing jutsu was \"much more potent\" than Tsunade's. \n\nDuring a flashback when Hashirama and Tobirama are talking, Hashirama says that his brother will be leading the village soon. As if he knows that he doesn't have much time left. Unless this is just some mysterious illness like Itachi it makes sense that it is from overuse of his healing jutsu.",

It's not like he could teach her the same exact technique. In fact, Madara calls it an \"imitation\" of Hashirama's technique to mock her. If a watered down imitation can shorten lifespans, I believe a more potent one could too. \n\nIt also explains why Tsunade is still alive even in Boruto while Hashirama died much younger. It was watered down and she didn't use it as much. \n\nThis is just the best theory I got. The only other explanation is a mysterious illness like Itachi which *could* be true since I doubt they had the best medical care back then.",

That's all I'm saying. \n\nAnd yes, I'm aware that children's shows can have good writing, but that's not why I brought it up as a point. \n\nIf something is a children's show, that doesn't mean that it **can't** have good writing, it means you're a little bit silly if you're **expecting** it to have good writing because frankly kids don't care about that shit. \n\nSpending time and money to come up with a better story, when you can always dump out a bad story and still get hella paid is not a smart business move, and they know that.\n\nYou're not gonna like hearing this, but Naruto's legacy is over my friend.

I was saying that the children in Boruto are like human children in that sense, because that's literally what the fuck they are. I can call back to reality if I want to. It wouldn't work the other way around given that Naruto is fictional, but I can call back to a phenomenon that happens in the real world because it's clearly applicable and demonstrated in the show. I'm the one who's correct here, not you. \n\nAre you gonna find it happen in the real world as many times as it happens in Naruto? No probably not. \n\nBut is it possible? Fuck yeah it is. If complete and total realism is what you're looking for in a series like Naruto or Boruto, then you're the one with the weak argument anyways, not me.\n\n> pretty bad defense of Boruto\n\nNot defending Boruto, just asking for some fucking consistency from you people instead of y'all being on here acting like such boomer tards always saying shit like \"Boruto bad, Naruto good, now give me upvotes\". I don't even like Boruto that much, and there's definitely way better fucking things to watch.

            "body": "Along with the stuff you and the others mentioned, I've got another problem.\n\nSo yeah we know obviously Boruto is gonna have to surpass Naruto (as much as that may be a kick in the balls to us fans), but it's the way he's doing it that annoys me. Well firstly I suppose there's the fact Naruto and Sasuke have been/are getting nerfed, but it's something else. It's the Jougan and the Karma/Momoshiki nonsense.\n\nIn the original Naruto series, we straight away see the Nine Tails, and we know that it's sealed in Naruto and we over the course of the series learn that he can learn to control it (which he eventually does), and then Naruto gets additional powers from the Sage of Six Paths (and then he loses some? idk I'm still not clear on what powers he lost. honestly he should have just been allowed to keep everything) and while that may seem ass-pully, the Sage of Six Paths is someone we learn about before, so it's not too farfetched. This makes Naruto one of the strongest ninja alive.\n\nSo, Boruto (technically) has to surpass Naruto. How does he do it? Well first of all there's the Jougan, which he gets from Toneri. Now this is so god damn dumb. Toneri first appeared in The Last: Naruto The Movie, and in that movie he was Naruto's enemy, and upon being defeated, said he'd make sure the moon (and so he) never come close to the Earth again (or something like that). And then what does he do? Around the time that Boruto starts at the academy, he gives him a new special OP eye, and then doesn't tell anyone about it. Like if Naruto and Hinata knew where it came from, they'd be pretty god damn pissed I imagine. I mean why wouldn't they? An alien they fought against just snuck a conversation with their 7 year old son and fucked with his eyes.\n\nAnd then, there's the Karma/Momoshiki stuff. So you're telling me that during Boruto's short fight against Momoshiki, he was able to quickly put a weird seal on his body that allows him to take control and for Boruto's body to do some weird shit? Nah, this is way too ass pully for me. Both of these things are so dumb.\n\nAnd then yeah, as others have mentioned, now there's new conflict in the world. But if you remember in Naruto, Jiraiya's mission was to find the Child of Prophecy, the one who would either bring destruction or peace to the world. Eventually, Naruto found out about all this, and learnt that he was the child of prophecy, and so as we know, he won the Fourth Great Ninja War and brought peace to the world.\n\nBut then Boruto exists, and new big conflicts arise. Which means Naruto failed. Naruto is the Child of Prophecy, he took on a mission passed down to him from Jiraiya, Nagato and Minato...and now that there's these new threats in the world, and bad things are gonna happen in the future...that means Naruto ultimately failed in his mission as the Child of Prophecy. Or at the very least, there was no meaning to that prophecy, if one day his son was just gonna get some OP powers from bullshit sources and surpass him to save the world",

It's highly unlikely that he was killed in battle, especially because Madara was gone. Who else could rival him and kill him, the guy with healing even greater than Tsunade, along with all his other jutsu and Sage Mode? \n\nDuring the 5 Kage vs Madara fight, Madara says that Hashirama's healing jutsu was \"much more potent\" than Tsunade's. \n\nDuring a flashback when Hashirama and Tobirama are talking, Hashirama says that his brother will be leading the village soon. As if he knows that he doesn't have much time left. Unless this is just some mysterious illness like Itachi it makes sense that it is from overuse of his healing jutsu.",

It's not like he could teach her the same exact technique. In fact, Madara calls it an \"imitation\" of Hashirama's technique to mock her. If a watered down imitation can shorten lifespans, I believe a more potent one could too. \n\nIt also explains why Tsunade is still alive even in Boruto while Hashirama died much younger. It was watered down and she didn't use it as much. \n\nThis is just the best theory I got. The only other explanation is a mysterious illness like Itachi which *could* be true since I doubt they had the best medical care back then.",

            "body": "> these are 2 very different arguments\n\nUh no the fuck they're not. I was saying that the children in Boruto are like human children in that sense, because that's literally what the fuck they are. I can call back to reality if I want to. It wouldn't work the other way around given that Naruto is fictional, but I can call back to a phenomenon that happens in the real world because it's clearly applicable and demonstrated in the show. I'm the one who's correct here, not you. \n\nAre you gonna find it happen in the real world as many times as it happens in Naruto? No probably not. \n\nBut is it possible? Fuck yeah it is. If complete and total realism is what you're looking for in a series like Naruto or Boruto, then you're the one with the weak argument anyways, not me.\n\n> pretty bad defense of Boruto\n\nNot defending Boruto, just asking for some fucking consistency from you people instead of y'all being on here acting like such boomer tards always saying shit like \"Boruto bad, Naruto good, now give me upvotes\". I don't even like Boruto that much, and there's definitely way better fucking things to watch. Just be consistent in your criticisms holy shit.\n\nNot going to address anything else you said because that's just opinion, and an interpretation that will differentiate among people.",

It's not like he could teach her the same exact technique. In fact, Madara calls it an \"imitation\" of Hashirama's technique to mock her. If a watered down imitation can shorten lifespans, I believe a more potent one could too. \n\nIt also explains why Tsunade is still alive even in Boruto while Hashirama died much younger. It was watered down and she didn't use it as much. \n\nThis is just the best theory I got. The only other explanation is a mysterious illness like Itachi which *could* be true since I doubt they had the best medical care back then.",

It's not like he could teach her the same exact technique. In fact, Madara calls it an \"imitation\" of Hashirama's technique to mock her. If a watered down imitation can shorten lifespans, I believe a more potent one could too. \n\nIt also explains why Tsunade is still alive even in Boruto while Hashirama died much younger. It was watered down and she didn't use it as much. \n\nThis is just the best theory I got. The only other explanation is a mysterious illness like Itachi which *could* be true since I doubt they had the best medical care back then.",
