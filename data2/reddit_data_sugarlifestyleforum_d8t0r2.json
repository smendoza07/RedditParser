    "body": "Well, I think I did it, guys. After being ghosted on my first M&G last week, I... admittedly did something that's not really recommended here... but I ended up on a second M&G and it was awesome. \n\nI was just sitting down watching TV in the morning, and I happened to check my messages on SA, and this guy messaged me asking what I was up to. I said nothing. He asked if I'd be willing to meet up RIGHT THEN in a town an hour away from my house. Against all my better judgement, I said sure and (after I'm ready and thankfully moved to an area a decent distance from my house) he got me an Uber to the place. Mind you, my dumbass didn't even bother asking what the place was called; I was just looking at memes during the whole Uber ride. Any time a doubt came into my mind, I would just tell myself \"well, he just spent $150 to Uber me here, so he can't possibly be bad.\" \n\nYeah, not my best moment. But thankfully, the guy ended up being really cool, and I actually really enjoyed the M&G (it was 3 hours, but it went by really fast!) Not only that, but he gave me $500 as I was leaving for having me meet him so suddenly... and he spent ANOTHER $150 getting me an Uber to school. Altogether this guy probably spent like, $700 on me in a few hours (not including what I ordered at the M&G) and coming from a very frugal/lower middle class family, this was a little bit shocking. \n\nSo folks... I guess I did it. I'm honestly really looking forward to our next date. \n\nTldr: a combination of stupid decisions and dumb luck got me a pretty generous SD a week after I was ghosted by a different POT.",
