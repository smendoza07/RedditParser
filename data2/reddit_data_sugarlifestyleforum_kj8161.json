It's an obviously deceptive vehicle for SA to entice SB's to innocently use their influence to market grossly overpriced and mostly junky stuff to potential SD.

It\u2019s not like it\u2019s worse than his overall website and being the glorified dodgy pimp he is. I think, we all knew before the post items on the wishlist were marked up. \n\nAnd, part of it is so u can send gifts to get a girl\u2019s attention and show interest in a girl without knowing her home address or before meeting. Not surprising, Yandy is a tacky site, so he should have used nicer or luxe brands at least. But, it shows the caliber of the website.",
