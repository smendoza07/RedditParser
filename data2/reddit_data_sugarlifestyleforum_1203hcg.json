    "body": "So ithis happened with my first SD, he was basically perfect. Huge allowance and also paying for my university tuition and gifts too! We also had same interests and hang out (just normal hanging out) often. The relationship got really serious after a while, he wanted to buy and apartment close to my uni so we could live together. I would come to his house unannounced often and he would always be happy, that's why it never crossed my mind if he was married or not. So one day i decided to go to his house because i had the afternoon free, i rang the doorbell and this woman answers the door, he mentioned he had a sister so i thought it was her, the convo went like this:\n\nWife: Oh hi there, are you in the right place?\n\nOP: Yeah I'm here to see SD, are you his sister?\n\nWife: No? I'm his wife, how do you know SD? \n\nSo yeah at that moment i didn't know what to do, so i just stood there dumbfounded, i saw SD in the window and he looked HORRIFIED. I was very hurt so i just told her there: \n\nOP: Sorry i didn't know he was married.\n\nlmao i was so petty back then, anyway that's what happened, but the wife was really nice about it, a few weeks after she reached out to me on Instagram and told me i didn't have to feel guilty because it was all SD fault. She told me he would pay for one more semester at uni and the allowance, this was because they were going to get a divorce and in her words she was going to get the most out of him. Also keep in mind she could have sued me and ask for compensation for ruining her marriage but she didn't, i really hope the best for her she's a queen \ud83d\udc51.\n\nAs for SD he still reaching out to me on insta, i blocked him many times but he keeps making insta accounts any advice on that? It's the typical stuff you know: I'm sorry, i want to get back together, you're the only one i try want blah blah blah.\n\nOverall this was an eyeopener, now i always their situation, but I'm still hurt about this. Anyway that's the story lol.\n\nEdit: Grammar errors haha, also someone dm me and told me the look of SD was the look of someone who knows they're about to be killed, pretty accurate! Thanks haha.",

My point was that a SD doesn't necessarily need to be un-partnered in order to enjoy a SD/SB relationship without cheating. As long as their partner agrees to being open of course.

Did either of you talk about your pasts? What did you know at all about his family? \n\nAnd I can understand that you may not consider her \"the past\" because he had to wait for a court date to sign a few more pieces of paper to be fully separated from her, but I'd like to pin down a specific complaint. Are you more angry that he didn't confide his problems and personal details to you? Because it sounds like you wanted this man to be your boyfriend, so you are hurt he didn't tell you anything. And you would have dumped him just as hard if he'd started sleeping with you on the other side of that final document signing... But didn't tell you anything vulnerable about himself.",
