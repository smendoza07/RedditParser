    "body": "Hey everyone. Girl here. I\u2019ve commented on and off on this sub for the past couple of years. I decided to make this massive post for all you guys out there because a lot of the time I feel like I\u2019m answering the same posts with the same responses. So here\u2019s a giant guide to men\u2019s hair.\n\n*******************************************************\n\n**General Hair Tips and Care**\n\n**Get your hair out of your face.** Give it some volume. Push it up and back/to the side, ruffle it up, whatever. I swear I say this to everyone. Don\u2019t let your hair grow straight down your face, don\u2019t let it just be matted flat on your head. This is a quick, simple way to give your hair some personality.\n\n**Shampoo less.** Shampoo is not really for cleaning your hair. Shampoo is for cleaning your scalp. Buy some sulfate free shampoo. Start shampooing every other day, rather than daily. Depending on your hair, scalp, and personal preferences, you can start going for longer periods of time without shampooing. I started shampooing every other day, then once a week, then once a month, and now I rarely ever shampoo (see /r/nopoo (also, for reference, I have thick wavy hair a couple inches past my armpits)). When you do use shampoo, don\u2019t lather your hair like people always seem to on TV commercials. Like I said, shampoo isn\u2019t really made for cleaning you hair. Take just a tiny dab of shampoo and sort of massage it into your scalp. \n\n**Shower in cold water.** Everyone loves their boiling hot shower, I know. That\u2019s fine. But, at least, at the end of your shower, when you\u2019re ready to rinse out your conditioner, blast it out with some cool water. I\u2019ve worked up my tolerance to the point where I *prefer* cold showers. Cold water is beneficial to your hair and skin. Showering in hot water all the time can damage your hair, when my hair dries after a hot shower, it tends to be drier, puffy instead of curly, and just drab. After a cold shower, my hair dries softer, sleeker and curlier.\n\n**Avoid heat.** I\u2019ve already told you to rinse your hair in cold water. You should also avoid heat while you\u2019re styling your hair. Blow driers and straighteners can cause a lot of damage to your hair. Use them sparingly.\n\n**Dry your hair with a t-shirt or soft towel.**  The towels you use to dry off your body are likely too rough for your hair. I recently went to target and bought a ton or *super* soft towels. It\u2019s not a huge thing, but I\u2019ve noticed my hair\u2019s softer and less frizzy. I\u2019ve used T-shirts but they tend to soak pretty quickly and it\u2019s not comfortable to have soggy clothes on your head. I have a lot of hair though.\n\n**Replace your Barber with a Stylist.** There\u2019s a difference. I\u2019ve had the same stylist for over a decade now. His name is Paul. He\u2019s magic. I\u2019ve screwed up my hair dozens of times over the years, box dyes, home haircuts, you name it. Paul\u2019s always been able to fix it. Paul\u2019s haircuts don\u2019t always look exactly the way I wanted them to look coming in, but they always turn out way better than I was expecting them to look. On a few occasions, I\u2019ve gone to Fantastic Sam\u2019s or one of those chain barber\u2019s shops.  I\u2019ll describe what I want, show pictures, ect. but I\u2019ve never been happy with my hair after getting it cut there. Paul knows how to communicate. He asks what I want, if he doesn\u2019t understand he\u2019ll ask more specific questions until he can picture what I\u2019m asking for as clearly as I can. Then he makes my hair look better than I imagined it would. And *so damn soft.* Find yourself a Paul.\n\n**If you have a hairstyle in mind** (which you probably should if you\u2019ve scheduled a hair appointment), **bring a picture to your stylist.** You can describe a style in as much detail as you want, but there\u2019s a ton of room for misinterpretation. It\u2019s not weird to bring a picture. It\u2019s helpful. It\u2019s the best way to get your thoughts across to the person cutting your hair. When you show them the picture, point out to them what you like about the style, anything you\u2019d change about it, etc. Say \u201cI\u2019m going for something like this. I like how this guy\u2019s hair is long on the top and shaved on the sides. But I think I want my hair on the top to be a tad shorter than his is.\u201d\n\n**Ask your stylist how he/she did it.** I\u2019ve gotten my hair cut & styled and had it look absolutely awesome, but when I try to replicate the style at home, it just wasn\u2019t the same. Ask your stylist, \u201cHey, what did you do to make my hair so soft/curly/smooth/whatever\u201d or \u201cHow do I make my hair stay up like this? Any special products that would help?\u201d\n\n*******************************************************\n\n**Men\u2019s hair products** (Beyond shampoo and conditioner)\n\nI know nearly nothing about men\u2019s hair products. So here\u2019s a couple of articles.\n\n[A GQ article describing a bunch of different types of hair products and their uses.](http://www.gq.com/how-to/groom/200312/choose-hair-product)\n\n[A Business Insider article claiming there\u2019s only 3 types of hair products you need.](http://www.businessinsider.com/mens-hair-product-2014-11)\n\n[An article about choosing products based on your hair type](http://www.blacklapel.com/thecompass/how-to-choose-the-right-hair-product/)\n\n*******************************************************\n\n**Face Shapes**\n\nA lot of people ask \u201cwhat\u2019s my face shape? what haircut would look good with my face shape?\u201d on here.  On the sidebar of this sub, you\u2019ll find a link titled \u201cBest Hairstyles for you Face Shape\u201d. It will help you identify your face shape and illustrate the hairstyle that fits that face best. Now, I can\u2019t tell you what my face shape is. I have no idea. I just went and stared in the mirror for a minute. According to the chart I suppose I have a diamond shaped face, maybe a round face? Oval?. I guess it might be easier for **other** people to identify your face shape. Once you figure out what shape face you have, here\u2019s a picture or album for each face shape showing hair styles that work best for it:\n\n[Round.](http://i.imgur.com/0tVP9ie.jpg) The chart suggests a \u201csquare\u201d haircut to offset roundness. I had trouble finding a picture for this one, but I think this picture I found would work.\n\n[Diamond.](http://imgur.com/a/JBq8A) The chart suggests \u201chigh volume\u201d hair styles. I think a lot of styles could work for a diamond faced guy.\n\n[Oblong.](http://imgur.com/a/rW4Gf) Here\u2019s some hair cuts for oblong faces. All longer on the top, but *even* with the sides.\n\n[Square.](http://imgur.com/a/VLHim) Here\u2019s Short \u201ctight\u201d hair with volume on top, like the chart suggests\n\n[Triangular.](http://i.imgur.com/1IcsTKc.jpg) The chart suggests mid-length hair with an off center part or side swept bangs. This picture\u2019s a pretty good example of all of that.\n\n[Oval.](http://i.imgur.com/e44UBW2.jpg) Apparently guys with oval shaped faces can pull off a whole lot of hair styles, so I don\u2019t have any specific styles. Here\u2019s a random oval faced dude with some fancy hair.\n\n*******************************************************\n\n**Making a Post that will Yield the most Helpful Advice**\n\nI\u2019ve seen a surprising amount of posts where people say something like \u201cI\u2019m getting a haircut tomorrow, what would look good on me?\u201d Figure out what hairstyle you\u2019re aiming for *before* scheduling a hair appointment. On a few of the posts I\u2019ve seen, I think the person would look best if they let their hair *grow out* a bit. Too late, they\u2019ve already committed.\n\nPost pictures of yourself. We can\u2019t tell you what would look good on you if you don\u2019t post any pictures!\n\nPost *good* pictures of yourself. Don\u2019t take picture of yourself on your laptop webcam while you reclined on your couch. This doesn\u2019t show your face shape, it just gives you double chins. Take two pictures of your face with the camera at face level (not lower). One of the pictures should show your natural \u201cstraight face\u201d and the other your natural smile. You don\u2019t *really* need two pictures, but a variety of photos of you helps give a better idea of what your face *really* looks like. A lot of these lazy web-cam straight face pictures look like mug shots and aren\u2019t very representative of what you actually look like 90% of the time. Side/profile/other angel views are also helpful, but I find I use the full face pictures most often as a reference when giving hair advise, so focus on those.\n\nTell us about your hair. What\u2019s your routine? What products do you use? What hairstyles have you had in the past? What does your hair feel like? /r/malehairadvise is mostly focused on hair cuts and styles, but hair health and quality is important too! I also tend to suggest products to people a lot, but it\u2019d be easier to suggest the perfect products if I knew more about their hair.\n\n*******************************************************\n\n**Hair Tutorials**\n\nI\u2019ve already told you to keep your hair out of your face, push it up and back, and all of that. Tutorials can show you how to do that gracefully and how to style your hair all nice in the morning. Search around, you\u2019ll find some tutorials for your hair type and desired style. Here\u2019s some random ones I found:\n\n[Straight haired dude using various products to achieve various styles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZGesadH6Nk)\n\n[Wavy/curly haired dude styling his hair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ys0WYTm-DPQ)\n\n[Curly haired dude showing his hair routine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCYunGTk-FI)\n\n[Straightish haired dude showing how he curls his hair without heat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKMy6Ha2JXs)\n\n[Curly to straight slicked back hair tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5K3rmv3I04)\n\n[Styling a pompadour for people with wavy/curly hair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z59ycP4rq0I)\n\n[Here\u2019s this one dude\u2019s youtube account. He has a ton of hair tutorials.](https://www.youtube.com/user/joeisblu/videos)\n\n*******************************************************\n\n**Haircuts to Avoid**\n\n[The Flippy \u201cBieber\" Cut.](http://37.media.tumblr.com/ccc6bcdbf972e03c844296a3591c3030/tumblr_mlxj2zBYoE1ru7gk2o1_1280.jpg) I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re 13 and this is still cool. Just because it\u2019s the most popular hair style, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the best. It\u2019s not. \n\n[Flat on the face.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Minister_Nathan_Guy_-_photo.jpg) Push it up/back/to the side/do something with it. Always\n\n[Flat bangs.](https://medtopicwriter.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/iainracerbaby.jpg) I couldn\u2019t actually find a picture of this on anyone over 10, but I\u2019ve seen this on teenagers and grown men too much. It\u2019s sort of like the flat on the face one I just talked about, except longer and cut straight across.\n\n*******************************************************\n\n**Misc. tips and Answers to some Commonly Asked Questions**\n\n* How do I describe this style to my barber?\n\nThe same way you just described it to us - *with a picture, dammit!*\n\n* Can I grow my hair out/pull off a man bun?\n\nMaybe! You can always cut it all off if you decide it doesn\u2019t fit you! While you grow it out, be sure to style it and keep it from growing straight down your face/head until it gets long enough to part without product or put up in a bun/pony tail.\n\n* If you keep your hair medium/short, it best to keep your hair shorter on the sides and longer on the top. If you keep your hair longer, try layers.\n\n* [Coconut oil is awesome](http://www.naturallivingideas.com/coconut-oil-for-hair/) for your hair. You can also use it on your skin, nails, use it as make up remover, use it to make tooth paste, and even use it as lube.\n\n*******************************************************\n\n[To close, here\u2019s my collection of pretty guy hair.](http://imgur.com/a/5jISi)\n\nIf you have any pretty guy hair pictures, questions, or think of something I should add or change to this post, let me know!\n\n*******************************************************\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your comments/questions/suggestions! I have some things to add.\n\nFirst of all, as a couple of you pointed out, **stylists are not always good, and barbers are not always bad.** My \u201cGet a stylist, not a barber\u201d comment implied that, but the title is not the important part.\n\nThe definition of a barber is \u201csomeone who cuts hair, especially men\u2019s.\u201d The definition of a stylist is \u201cA person noted for elegant work or performance, in particular.\u201d What I meant by \u201cget a stylist, not a barber\u201d was, don\u2019t just get someone who cuts hair, get someone who cuts hair *damn well.* You can\u2019t just find someone who calls themselves a hair stylist and expect a good hair cut. Try out a few different barbers & stylist until you find someone who you *love.*\n\n**Another note about finding a barber/stylist:** if you\u2019re going for a drastic change in your look, don\u2019t go to a completely new barber.  A couple years ago I was going for a chin length bob, [something like this.](http://www.cosmtools.com/img/201110/l-131969908351.jpg) I went to Fantastic Sam\u2019s, and some random lady cut my hair. She didn\u2019t factor in my curly hair, she just cut my wet hair to my chin. When it dried (for some reason she didn\u2019t even ask if I wanted my hair blow dried, she just sent me out with soaking hair), my hair was way shorter than I\u2019d intended. It\u2019s important to go to the same barber because they learn what works for your hair, what you like, and can give you a better cut and better advice because they *know you.*\n\n**Things to put in your hair beyond shampoo and conditioner**\n\nI made a lengthy comment about this in reply to /u/TheBurningSoda\u2019s question. [So here\u2019s a link to that.](https://www.reddit.com/r/malehairadvice/comments/3a8nje/i_compiled_a_big_list_of_hair_tips_and_advice_for/csb2uku) Or, yknow, you could just scroll down. But I highly suggest looking into hair mask, oils, ect. You can literally google \u201cfood to put in your hair\u201d and you\u2019ll find tons of information. Hair masks are great for your hair but not something most guys would think of. ",

Use five oils: almond, castor, olive, coconut and lavender oils. Mix together equal proportions of each.\n4) Don't brush your hair too much. Brushing your hair stimulates the follicles which promotes growth, but brushing too much too often, will cause damage to your hair strands that results in frizz and split ends.\n5) Use onion oil, this helps fight hair loss and gives you silky black hair.\nhttp://www.clinicspots.com/hairtransplant/",

                    "body": "I've used egg yolk in my hair a few times, I've also used olive oil a few times too, but I haven't actually tried them *together.* \n\nI'm not sure if it's me being weird (probably) or if other people have had this problem too, but I find it difficult to apply egg to my hair.  If I just kind of dump it on my hair, it slides right down and off my head before I have time to spread it in. I\u2019ve tried getting it on my hands and rubbing it in with my hands, but I can never get enough of it on my hands. Anyways, here\u2019s some tips about any sort of hair masks/packs/whatever you want to call it:\n\n* Mix liquidy ingredients like egg and olive oil with thicker ingredients like avocado & banana. You might need an electric or hand crank mixer. This will help solve the runniness issue. \n\n* Use a spray bottle to apply oils. I put coconut oil in my spray bottle. It will let you apply oil more evenly than if you were to just dump it on your head. You could also soak a paper towel and squeeze it over your head, or soak your hands and to apply it directly, but my preference is spray bottles, they\u2019re the least messy method I\u2019ve found. I'm sure you could also put eggs in a spray bottle and make it work if you really wanted to, but that sounds like a terrible idea.\n\nCommon things to put in your hair & benefits\n\n**Coconut oil.** I love coconut oil. It\u2019s useful for *everything.* I typically put it in my hair over night to let it soak in, then I wash it out in the morning. It has all sorts of benefits, but its mostly used for moisturizing. I suggest liquid coconut oil, [this is what I use.](http://www.gnc.com/Natures-Way-Liquid-Coconut-Permium-Oil/product.jsp?productId=59131406&KPID=20765526&mr:trackingCode=7002AE6E-26BF-E411-8294-BC305BF923E4&mr:referralID=NA&mr:filter=125038301354&mr:ad=79864651394&kpid=20765526&mr:device=c&mr:match=&CAWELAID=59131406&mr:adType=plaonline&mr:keyword=&pla=pla_20765526) I put it in a spray bottle to make it easy to apply, and I find it easier to get out of your hair than thick coconut oil.\n\n**Olive Oil.** Like coconut oil, olive oil is good for loads of hair types, it can help with dandruff, strength & breakage prevention, and will make hair softer, smoother, and shinier. \n\n**Banana.** Bananas are sort of like a natural conditioner. Use over ripe bananas and make sure to blend them until they\u2019re smooth with no clumps or strings before applying to your hair. It can be hard to get out of your hair if you\u2019re not careful.\n\n**Avocado.** Avacado works for smoothing frizzy, dry hair, making it soft and shiny, moisturizing, and getting rid of dandruff. It\u2019s also awesome for your skin.\n\n**Honey.** I\u2019ve never used honey but it\u2019s supposed to soften, smooth, moisturize, and add shine to your hair. This is one of the messier things on this list.\n\n**Eggs.** Eggs are very popular for hair.  They\u2019re mostly used to make hair shiny, soft, smooth, and to repair damage. I\u2019ve read if you rinse out egg with hot water, you can accidentally cook the egg into your hair, which sounds hilarious, but be cautious of that I suppose.\n\n**Brown Sugar.** This sounds super messy, but I\u2019ve read you can use brown sugar in a hair mask to straighten your hair.\n\n**Baking Soda.** I\u2019ve heard of using baking soda as a replacement for shampoo. It\u2019s good for removing build up in your hair without damaging it. I\u2019ve been meaning to try this one out but I always forget to bring baking soda in the shower with me.\n\n**Apple Cider Vinegar.** This stuff apparently balances the pH of your scalp and can be used to treat dandruff & oiliness. Like baking soda, this could be a good replacement for shampoo\n\n**Corn Starch.** Corn starch is used for oily hair. Say you don\u2019t have time wash your hair one morning - corn startch! Put it in dry hair.\n\n**Mayonaise.** Mayonaise gives you hair moisture, and, like apple cider vinegar, it balances the pH of your scalp.\n\n**Milk.** Milk can be used as a conditioner and can treat dry hair. Like a ton of these products, it makes your hair shiny soft and moisturized\n\n**Yogurt.** Yogurt is a moisturizer that helps with dry, frizzy hair and dandruff. Make sure you use *plain* yogurt. Nothing with fruit in it or weird flavors. You can get a big ice-cream-tub-sized container of greek yogurt at the grocery store.\n\n**Molasses/Maple Syrup.** You can use either of these for softer, smoother hair. Make sure you use *real* maple syrup. I also think this is best paired with one or more of these other ingredients. I\u2019ve read some reviews of people who were disappointed in their results when they just used straight up molasses/syrup.\n\nI basically suggest researching some hair mask recipes. You can find recipes for any hair. Try some depending on your hair type, and try some of these ingredients on their own, so you can identify which ones work best. Then you can mix and match your favorites. The ones I like the best are coconut oil, banana, and avocado, for reference, my hair is thick, wavy and a bit dry and frizzy.\n\ntl;dr put a bunch of food in your hair",

Grabbed whatever my hand could and just patted it into my hair before trying to get it into my scalp. After way to many minutes i grew bored and just tilted my head foreward into the bowl, to make my hair absord the mixture and then I tried to get it into my scalp. Sat like 20 minutes and questioned my life choices.\n\nWas it worth it? Hell i dont know. Maybe. My hair felt nicer, and my scalp wasnt as ichy as it can be.

Use citric acid instead of lemon juice: It's odorless and won't bleach your hair or permanently scar your skin. \n\nIf you have hard water, go get a showerhead filter.",

            "body": "I've used egg yolk in my hair a few times, I've also used olive oil a few times too, but I haven't actually tried them *together.* \n\nI'm not sure if it's me being weird (probably) or if other people have had this problem too, but I find it difficult to apply egg to my hair.  If I just kind of dump it on my hair, it slides right down and off my head before I have time to spread it in. I\u2019ve tried getting it on my hands and rubbing it in with my hands, but I can never get enough of it on my hands. Anyways, here\u2019s some tips about any sort of hair masks/packs/whatever you want to call it:\n\n* Mix liquidy ingredients like egg and olive oil with thicker ingredients like avocado & banana. You might need an electric or hand crank mixer. This will help solve the runniness issue. \n\n* Use a spray bottle to apply oils. I put coconut oil in my spray bottle. It will let you apply oil more evenly than if you were to just dump it on your head. You could also soak a paper towel and squeeze it over your head, or soak your hands and to apply it directly, but my preference is spray bottles, they\u2019re the least messy method I\u2019ve found. I'm sure you could also put eggs in a spray bottle and make it work if you really wanted to, but that sounds like a terrible idea.\n\nCommon things to put in your hair & benefits\n\n**Coconut oil.** I love coconut oil. It\u2019s useful for *everything.* I typically put it in my hair over night to let it soak in, then I wash it out in the morning. It has all sorts of benefits, but its mostly used for moisturizing. I suggest liquid coconut oil, [this is what I use.](http://www.gnc.com/Natures-Way-Liquid-Coconut-Permium-Oil/product.jsp?productId=59131406&KPID=20765526&mr:trackingCode=7002AE6E-26BF-E411-8294-BC305BF923E4&mr:referralID=NA&mr:filter=125038301354&mr:ad=79864651394&kpid=20765526&mr:device=c&mr:match=&CAWELAID=59131406&mr:adType=plaonline&mr:keyword=&pla=pla_20765526) I put it in a spray bottle to make it easy to apply, and I find it easier to get out of your hair than thick coconut oil.\n\n**Olive Oil.** Like coconut oil, olive oil is good for loads of hair types, it can help with dandruff, strength & breakage prevention, and will make hair softer, smoother, and shinier. \n\n**Banana.** Bananas are sort of like a natural conditioner. Use over ripe bananas and make sure to blend them until they\u2019re smooth with no clumps or strings before applying to your hair. It can be hard to get out of your hair if you\u2019re not careful.\n\n**Avocado.** Avacado works for smoothing frizzy, dry hair, making it soft and shiny, moisturizing, and getting rid of dandruff. It\u2019s also awesome for your skin.\n\n**Honey.** I\u2019ve never used honey but it\u2019s supposed to soften, smooth, moisturize, and add shine to your hair. This is one of the messier things on this list.\n\n**Eggs.** Eggs are very popular for hair.  They\u2019re mostly used to make hair shiny, soft, smooth, and to repair damage. I\u2019ve read if you rinse out egg with hot water, you can accidentally cook the egg into your hair, which sounds hilarious, but be cautious of that I suppose.\n\n**Brown Sugar.** This sounds super messy, but I\u2019ve read you can use brown sugar in a hair mask to straighten your hair.\n\n**Baking Soda.** I\u2019ve heard of using baking soda as a replacement for shampoo. It\u2019s good for removing build up in your hair without damaging it. I\u2019ve been meaning to try this one out but I always forget to bring baking soda in the shower with me.\n\n**Apple Cider Vinegar.** This stuff apparently balances the pH of your scalp and can be used to treat dandruff & oiliness. Like baking soda, this could be a good replacement for shampoo\n\n**Corn Starch.** Corn starch is used for oily hair. Say you don\u2019t have time wash your hair one morning - corn startch! Put it in dry hair.\n\n**Mayonaise.** Mayonaise gives you hair moisture, and, like apple cider vinegar, it balances the pH of your scalp.\n\n**Milk.** Milk can be used as a conditioner and can treat dry hair. Like a ton of these products, it makes your hair shiny soft and moisturized\n\n**Yogurt.** Yogurt is a moisturizer that helps with dry, frizzy hair and dandruff. Make sure you use *plain* yogurt. Nothing with fruit in it or weird flavors. You can get a big ice-cream-tub-sized container of greek yogurt at the grocery store.\n\n**Molasses/Maple Syrup.** You can use either of these for softer, smoother hair. Make sure you use *real* maple syrup. I also think this is best paired with one or more of these other ingredients. I\u2019ve read some reviews of people who were disappointed in their results when they just used straight up molasses/syrup.\n\nI basically suggest researching some hair mask recipes. You can find recipes for any hair. Try some depending on your hair type, and try some of these ingredients on their own, so you can identify which ones work best. Then you can mix and match your favorites. The ones I like the best are coconut oil, banana, and avocado, for reference, my hair is thick, wavy and a bit dry and frizzy.\n\ntl;dr put a bunch of food in your hair",
