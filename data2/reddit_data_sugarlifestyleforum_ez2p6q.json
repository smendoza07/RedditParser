    "body": "&#x200B;\n\nWhen I first met my SD he looked so old, I remember thinking \"yeahhh I don't think I could fuck him lol\" he was 69. (To be fair he probably thought the same thing when I showed up to the first date, at a fine dining restaurant, with doc martens, a skirt and a crop tank top.)\n\nNow that hes 70, the way I think and see him is so different. When I take pictures of him or look at him closely, I see the vibrancy and youth in his eyes and smile. His wrinkles only accentuate his features and he looks so handsome.\n\nThen when I rub his belly after sex I like to fantasize about how much more handsome of a man he must've been 20/30 years ago. He probably wouldn't have given me the time of day LOL. \\*cry\n\nAnd for a third layer, when I look at him I'm just beaming with gratituide of everything hes done for me. He's helped me transition from a teenager to a young woman(19-21). He has been a shoulder to cry on, and has been my bestest friend and teacher. I have so much adoration, love and respect for this man I wish I could somehow spend the rest of my life with him.\n\nLike we always tell each other.....we'll find a way to meet up in the next life.",
