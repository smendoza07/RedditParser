I've got hair almost exactly like yours but I don't know how to tie it and have it look as good as that. I look like a balding office worker from a bad angle since my tied up top goes flat and no strands come out.",

My hair looks amazing when it's out loose, I just look like a dork with it tied up which is quite annoying as it's unmanageable on days I don't apply mousse (and I don't want to use styling product on it every day). \n\nTying it looser has definitely been incredibly helpful though! I usually just pull a little mini fringe out over one eyebrow to not look like im balding when I actually have incredible hair genes.",

My hair looks amazing when it's out loose, I just look like a dork with it tied up which is quite annoying as it's unmanageable on days I don't apply mousse (and I don't want to use styling product on it every day). \n\nTying it looser has definitely been incredibly helpful though! I usually just pull a little mini fringe out over one eyebrow to not look like im balding when I actually have incredible hair genes.",

My hair looks amazing when it's out loose, I just look like a dork with it tied up which is quite annoying as it's unmanageable on days I don't apply mousse (and I don't want to use styling product on it every day). \n\nTying it looser has definitely been incredibly helpful though!
