    "body": "Spent the last three days with my remote SB, who is in town for a bit.   As part of this visit, I told her what I wanted to do for Christmas.  Covid has eliminated her job and like many, she is struggling financially.  I found out that she has been forced to draw on a line of credit.  She is now working on some lifestyle changes to deal with today\u2019s financial realities.  \n\nSo I told her that I was going to pay off her line of credit as a practical Xmas present.   She was grateful and kind of shocked.  It didn\u2019t stop her from asking for the cutest lingerie idea on top of that.  She explained that this would be \u201cwin-win\u201d for the both of us.  With her typical grin.  Of course, I am now working on making that happen too.  \n\nHere is the sweetness thing.   She asked me to not forget the card, with whatever I choose to write in it.  She has this thing for the written word.  Treasures it.  Then she told me she has saved every card I have ever given her.  Including the notes that the florist has included when I send her flowers.  My words of course.  \n\nI am literally still melting a day later.",
