The messy style looks great on you. \nDepending on what type of hair you have, I\u2019d stay at that length personally, but trust me it is really informative to grow it long at least once in your youth.\n\nA friend of mine, who is much older than you, has been rocking that look you have for 5 years or so. The natural curls always tend to look cool and he told me it doesn\u2019t require any product. As a long haired guy myself with thin straight hair, that shit is so unfair, as volume is a big challenge for me. \nTry playing to the strengths of what you have, OP, and be confident cause you look cool already :)",
