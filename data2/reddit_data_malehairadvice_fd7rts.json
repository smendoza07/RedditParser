You've said that you've got curly hair in other comments, so I SUPER recommend going through r/curly and following the CG routine. It stops hair frizzing and helps clump it into defined curls.\n\nThe basic steps are:\n1) use shampoo without parabens/silicones bunch of other things (check the sub for the full list)\n2) there is no such thing as too much conditioner\n3) NEVER EVER brush or comb curly hair or rub it dry with a towel. Either squeeze it with a microfiber or let it air dry\n4) curl cream, leave-in conditioner, and styling products are your friend. You want to squish them into the hair, then squish again once dry to crack the shell that the gels leave. Check the sub for more info. Good luck man!",

I don\u2019t know if the curls will hang and rest naturally on your forehead or if you need to place them there with your hands. I would say the curls will go there naturally if they are long enough. I don\u2019t know if your curls grow upwards or your type of curls but I think the curls will fall towards with a good length. Maybe some mousse/hairspray to hold? There are more pictures of him his name is Tony Effe. Also, r/curlyhair will probably help you more and there are good tips here on this thread.\n\nGood luck!",

I don\u2019t know if the curls will hang and rest naturally on your forehead or if you need to place them there with your hands. I would say the curls will go there naturally if they are long enough. I don\u2019t know if your curls grow upwards or your type of curls but I think the curls will fall towards with a good length. Maybe some mousse/hairspray to hold? There are more pictures of him his name is Tony Effe. Also, r/curlyhair will probably help you more and there are good tips here on this thread.\n\nGood luck!",

I don\u2019t know if your curls grow upwards or your type of curls but I think the curls will fall towards with a good length. Maybe some mousse/hairspray to hold? There are more pictures of him his name is Tony Effe. Also, r/curlyhair will probably help you more and there are good tips here on this thread.\n\nGood luck!",

I don\u2019t know if your curls grow upwards or your type of curls but I think the curls will fall towards with a good length. Maybe some mousse/hairspray to hold?

If it's still really wet then I'll grab a handful of hair through the towel and squeeze, until it's on the border between wet and damp, then apply all the leave-in product.\n\nTbh you can experiment and see what works for you. There's loads of videos on youtube and people with their own routines, just try some and see what works for you",

I don\u2019t know if the curls will hang and rest naturally on your forehead or if you need to place them there with your hands. I would say the curls will go there naturally if they are long enough. I don\u2019t know if your curls grow upwards or your type of curls but I think the curls will fall towards with a good length. Maybe some mousse/hairspray to hold? There are more pictures of him his name is Tony Effe. Also, r/curlyhair will probably help you more and there are good tips here on this thread.\n\nGood luck!",
