Even the gym/working out, that was a kind of hobby that improves massively his health, now is becoming more and more like work that have to be done. Specially since he started his YouTube channel. A really sad read, and i hope that before quiting it all, he starts by reducing schedules, and considering finding a partner, cause he may also be lonely and isn't aware of it.",
