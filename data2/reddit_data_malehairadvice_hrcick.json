Girl here :) I see what you\u2019re trying to achieve, but I think your hair is rebelling because maybe you are using the wrong products. \n\nFor your curls, I would suggest shaving it bald to see how you look (you seem like you\u2019d look fantastic bald!), and then use a good cleanser and a heavy moisturizer as it grows back. Maybe also post your photo in r/curlyhair and the lovely people there will give you more specific product recommendations! Maybe you\u2019ll even find some others with hair like yours who can relate to your struggles. \n\nI hope this is helpful. \n\nP.S. I agree with others, your facial hair makes you look a bit unkempt, which I\u2019m sure you are not. Shaving will make you look clean and sharp!",
