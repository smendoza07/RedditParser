The secret is knowing how to groom a crew cut. \n\n1) Towel dry hair completely.\n\n2) Barely dip fingertips in jar of butch wax(aka control wax) such as krew comb hair styling prep. Other traditional butch waxes still made include lucky tiger cru butch, gabel's crew cut, and  stix fix design polish. Krew comb is water soluble and washes out readily; the other named traditional waxes are not.

Guys didn't forego shampooing except every 3-4 days due to  \"Hi-Voltage\" that is  taken care of by butch wax. The issue with most butch(control) waxes is that ones that are not water soluble can build in the hair and not shampoo out readily. To remove a build up or over application: 1) apply a generous amount of straight shampoo to dry hair and lather up the hair. 2) rinse with warm water. 3) if a wax buildup remains, repeat.",

Guys didn't forego shampooing except every 3-4 days due to  \"Hi-Voltage\" that is  taken care of by butch wax. The issue with most butch(control) waxes is that ones that are not water soluble can build in the hair and not shampoo out readily. To remove a build up or over application: 1) apply a generous amount of straight shampoo to dry hair and lather up the hair. 2) rinse with warm water. 3) if a wax buildup remains, repeat.",
