    "body": "Wow does being ghosted and stood up suck. Had a \ngreat M&G last week.  Set up 2nd date for last night and I show up to the restaurant and get our seat.  She warned me she would be a little late.  Well she never showed up or messaged and still hasn't.  Obviously first thought is I hope nothing has happened to her but she logged on to SA this morning.  So my guess she found someone else. \n\nWhy can't people just be adults and just tell someone they aren't interested. That's so much better than being ignored.",

We were supposed to meet for coffee at 11 and I had told him the day before I might have to raincheck because I only had a half tank of gas that needed to last me the rest of the week. He said no no, I\u2019ve got some cash for you, please come anyway and I even asked are you sure because this is first meeting and he insisted. I sent him a message apologizing because I was running late due to some unexpected traffic but I was on my way (it\u2019s an hour drive for me). He doesn\u2019t respond or read it. I get there at 11:20 and message him again, hey I just pulled in, are you here? Walk in, get myself a green tea, look around, nope. Message again, still doesn\u2019t read it. I stayed there for 3 hours and decided to leave. Never been stood up before like that. Messaged him saying I hope he is okay and hopes nothing serious has happened. He\u2019s always had his status hidden so I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s been online but he certainly hasn\u2019t read my messages. \n\nNow I\u2019m worried about meeting long distance because if they just decide not to show it\u2019s costing me which is the total opposite of the point here. I was lookin so cute too \ud83e\udd72 favorite little black heels and all \ud83e\udd72",

It's happened enough to me over these first several months that my reaction has transitioned from \"angry\" too \"oh well\". But I can't deny that it still sucks down deep. Some people have no compassion or empathy or are just effing cruel.\n\nI've been in a handful of situations where I decided not to continue into the pending SR, or realized my interest had waned, or even chose a better option. In each case it took 30 seconds to write and send a text saying basically \"... thanks for your time and efforts but I'm choosing/going/moving elsewhere. Good luck\". 30 seconds! It's not even face to face - how awkward or hard can it really be? \n\n I can't imagine standing someone up.  My most recent experience... plans for our 2nd intimate date - she texts me \"on my way - kissy-face emoji\"  (from 45 minutes away). 1.5 hours later I've finished dinner, chatted up a young lady/fellow solo diner, and am heading home alone.  Never heard another word from her. What goes through the mind of someone willing and able to play that game I wonder? Dinner was good though. \"Oh well\"\n\nSugaring claims to support clear communication about all sorts of \"relationship\" details, from the mundane to the most seriously intimate. Yet some people can't bring themselves to just say \"sorry, changed my mind\". 'Effing cowards!",

Has never happened to me with a POT.\n\nHowever, I had a couple month SB who got comfortable, too comfortable, real quickly and did that sort of stuff a lot on dates. Yet, my dumbass for a few times sent the weekly allowance before our dates like clockwork. I remember once I was so lived, I drove an hour to meet her for lunch (took off work early and everything), am waiting for her to arrive. She went to school / worked 5 minutes away. About 15 minutes late she said she was on her way and would be there in 10 minutes, sorry for the delay... after waiting almost two hours and not hearing from her further, I sheepishly with my tail between my legs got up and left. She contacted me a few hours later and said she had a last minute client and felt it was inappropriate to text (I was livid, and said she could have at least texted me an apology and that she couldn't make it). Sadly it took a couple more no shows and cancelations for me to finally end things. She always had very sappy and horrible excuses (dog got hit by a car was one she used to leave a 5 star date early, AA sponsor died, her brother died - which i found out was her getting engaged thanks to social media... didnt know she was not single). Yeah she then tried extorting me. She was a horrible human being.\nThankfully haven't had that sort of stuff in over two years. Have had drama of course, but not that flakey cancelling not showing up stuff.\n\nIt comes with the bowl. Sorry that happened man. Let her know how you feel and move on.",

Pre pandemic I was ghosted often enough in the message and text stage but never got stood up once for a m&g.  Now it's happened twice in a week?  One of them at a place the SB chose!\n\nExcuses so lame too.  \"My alarm didn't go off\" or \"My mom called me and needs my help with something.\"  \"I don't feel good.\" Please!\n\nI always tried to mentally prepare to be stood up and so went in with the expectation that she wouldn't show.  I'm determined to enjoy my meal or drink alone if need be, and always choose a place I'd want to hang anyway. But I have to say it's a strangely high percentage occurrence now.",

His excuse was because the bank wasn't open and the ATM would only allow him to pull so much and that he'll pay the rest next time we meet. Gullible me is like, ok, yeah, that's fine! He hasn't replied to any of my text for about four days now. Yeah, it sucks being ghosted. Now I know how every guy ghosted feels like. Lol. \n\nI'm thinking to myself...
