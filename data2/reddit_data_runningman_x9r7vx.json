Originally, the group consisted of five members, but the now full-fleshed actor Lee Kwang-soo departed from the band to pursue acting. They are known for their deception concept, releasing teasers that are never seen in the music videos, promising to collab with other artists only to take advantage of them, and releasing music on a date they stated they would never do. But despite all of these, the group has seen massive success and are followed by a solid fanbase, and over time they were accepted and liked by the general public, though not for their music but by their antics.\n\nEdit: Grammar",
