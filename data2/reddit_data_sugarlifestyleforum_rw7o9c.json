Thankfully, laundry is free for now.",

Like. There are some people who should not be on the site that are. He had been out of prison for like two weeks and was living with his parents at 40 something years old and could DEFINITELY not afford an arrangement.",

One day in college, I am at a party, you know, all guys, cuz girls would not hang out with my nerdy ass (very reasonable of them).\n#\nSuddenly, a girl walks in (she was doing some school project with one of my friends).  Well the girl, (let's call her \"Amy\") was best friends with the girl I dated in high school. Had not seen Amy or Erin for three years. My first thought was \"oh my god, Erin got pregnant, had a kid, and now my life is over.\"\n#\nAmy walks over to me and says hi. I reply with (and I quote): \"You'll never take me alive!\"  \n#\nNow that doesn't make sense, even with context, but my brain was looking under \"things to say before you die.\"  Amy looked at me like I was insane, probably assumed I was drunk, and moved on with her life.

So, here was my process for renewing...\r  \n\r  \n(1) Went to the grocery store and bought a 100 Visa gift card (in the silver cardboard package). I've always used a physical gift card, not a virtual e-card.\r  \n\r  \n(2) Went home and registered the card on https://mygift.giftcardmall.com/ on my laptop. Using the number, expiration date and 3 digit code. I used a John Doe-like fake name, and a real address (but not my home address)\r  \n\r  \n(3) Went onto Seeking on the same laptop and renewed. The site popped up a window saying they don't take pre-paid cards and instead to use a real credit card. I ignored the pop up warning and went ahead. Using the same details that I registered it with about 5 minutes earlier. My pre paid Visa gift card was accepted with no problem. Now there is 1 cent left on it.\n\nMy plan was just to buy a 200 or 250 VISA gift card next time around and use the same process.",

The new monthly amount is a 'recurring' fee, and it looks like the vanilla card can't be used for a recurring fee anymore.  \n\n\nEither that, or my account has been flagged as the recurring payment getting declined... sucks because their one-time payment is now 3 months.... and we all know that SA for more than a month is a waste until the POT refresh...\n\nIf anyone was able to use a Prepaid for the month that means it'll probably have to be the first new account setup...",

Well the girl, (let's call her \"Amy\") was best friends with the girl I dated in high school. Had not seen Amy or Erin for three years. My first thought was \"oh my god, Erin got pregnant, had a kid, and now my life is over.\"\n#\nAmy walks over to me and says hi. I reply with (and I quote): \"You'll never take me alive!\"  \n#\nNow that doesn't make sense, even with context, but my brain was looking under \"things to say before you die.\"  Amy looked at me like I was insane, probably assumed I was drunk, and moved on with her life.

So, here was my process for renewing...\r  \n\r  \n(1) Went to the grocery store and bought a 100 Visa gift card (in the silver cardboard package). I've always used a physical gift card, not a virtual e-card.\r  \n\r  \n(2) Went home and registered the card on https://mygift.giftcardmall.com/ on my laptop. Using the number, expiration date and 3 digit code. I used a John Doe-like fake name, and a real address (but not my home address)\r  \n\r  \n(3) Went onto Seeking on the same laptop and renewed. The site popped up a window saying they don't take pre-paid cards and instead to use a real credit card. I ignored the pop up warning and went ahead. Using the same details that I registered it with about 5 minutes earlier. My pre paid Visa gift card was accepted with no problem. Now there is 1 cent left on it.\n\nMy plan was just to buy a 200 or 250 VISA gift card next time around and use the same process.",

So while on average things are worse, there are more quality options than ever before (and I'd argue that the best women have gotten better)\n\nBut my theory for raising the price is that it will improve the quality of women. Why? Because the legit SB won't have to sort through as many John's and vanilla guys keeping them on the site longer. Sure, platonic women and less attractive women will have the same benefit, but they'll still run into the same issues from legit SD.",

Well the girl, (let's call her \"Amy\") was best friends with the girl I dated in high school. Had not seen Amy or Erin for three years. My first thought was \"oh my god, Erin got pregnant, had a kid, and now my life is over.\"\n#\nAmy walks over to me and says hi. I reply with (and I quote): \"You'll never take me alive!\"  \n#\nNow that doesn't make sense, even with context, but my brain was looking under \"things to say before you die.\"  Amy looked at me like I was insane, probably assumed I was drunk, and moved on with her life.

So while on average things are worse, there are more quality options than ever before (and I'd argue that the best women have gotten better)\n\nBut my theory for raising the price is that it will improve the quality of women. Why? Because the legit SB won't have to sort through as many John's and vanilla guys keeping them on the site longer. Sure, platonic women and less attractive women will have the same benefit, but they'll still run into the same issues from legit SD.",

So while on average things are worse, there are more quality options than ever before (and I'd argue that the best women have gotten better)\n\nBut my theory for raising the price is that it will improve the quality of women. Why? Because the legit SB won't have to sort through as many John's and vanilla guys keeping them on the site longer. Sure, platonic women and less attractive women will have the same benefit, but they'll still run into the same issues from legit SD.",

Their ways of seeing which SD are active or paying members are heavily gated behind that paywall. \nSo realistically who do you think is even more unlikely to get a sub now? This will lead to even less quality I'm afraid.",

Scammers, platonics and rinsers are unlikely to get a dime from a salt and splenda to begin with, so even if it would get rid of some less wealthy SD, it would only make life easier for the scammers, rinsers and other bad SB. No clue why you have this misconception that someone tight on money or unwilling to pay at all will somehow be a juicy victim for a scammer, rinser or platonic. Those exist by merit of men with more money than sense.",
