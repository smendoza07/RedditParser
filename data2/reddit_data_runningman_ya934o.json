That Justin Bieber hairstyle also wasn't working for him. LKS is the other one who looks better, but I guess that is to be expected wasn't he like barely 25? \n\nAlso, Haha has so much swag so I always find him attractive. Before and now. Now more so.\n\nI kinda think they're all good looking, even YSC. He cleans up pretty well and he's manly so I find him attractive. JSM is a total goddess to me, like top 2 most beautiful Korean women (#1 is Kim Minji from Dreamcatcher https://i.imgur.com/5gO8EJQ_d.webp?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium ) \n\nEdit for link",

They're always talking about how fake he is. He doesn't do anything unless it's for his benefit. Like he isn't \"energetic\" or a\" team player\" until the cameras are on. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven in the early years, he always coveted being the main draw of the show but he just isn't. If elimination is the name of the game, he's usually the first one out. He's the most out of shape (which is why he targets women, b/c he thinks he'll have the edge), the laziest, the one that gripes the most, the one that tries to get the producers to edit him so he comes out in a good light, etc. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven when KJK invited YJS over to his YT channel and he was just a guest (at YJS behest) he still was trying to get as much camera time as possible (oh yeah and he stole/copied an idea that KJK and YJS said they wanted to do on YT in the future). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just get annoyed by his opportunistic, selfish, egotistical ways and it baffles me that YJS sees him as such a good friend. Maybe there's a reason for that off camera. But everything that I've seen on RM, YT, and How do you play just keeps cementing in my mind how self-centered and selfish he is and I wouldn't be  sad if he left the show or got replaced.

From what I've seen of other members about him, they only have nice things to say too. So I won't judge. I'm fine with character on the show too. \n\nAlso, when I used the word \"all the time\" I didn't mean it literally every single time. But many times, it has happened that KJK or LKS go after women or JSJ when they really don't needed to. This means they got eliminated early and didn't get screentime during those games. Actually one reason I'm glad the nametag game isn't around anymore! I really didn't like how unfair it was because it was pretty much impossible to win against LKS, YJS and KJK. It just wasn't fun when you knew exactly who was going to last the shortest amount time and who was gonna probably win. \n\nI don't mind him going after JSM either. I appreciate their father daughter dynamic as it's wholesome and cute. He also avoids SJH probably because of her fanatic fans, as he has actually said so during the show! So that just leaves JSM, and I'm all for it seeing them go at it. It's usually very hilarious too.\n\nEdit: but he's my third favorite member, so I'm probably biased. I can almost never find fault with my ultimate trio of JSM-YJS-JSJ. \ud83d\ude01 (And LKS when he was around)",

I feel like the game show era meant they didn't focus on the relationship and bond of the cast, it only came out through actions. It might be because I'm generally a passive person, I'm a woman, I don't like sports at all and I'd rather watch any movie other than action or sports films. LoL \n\nI think the great thing about this show is how it has evolved and has gained new fans over the years and also managed to maintain its old fans.",

Imagine something goes wrong,who going to answer towards the members family. My favourite mission was when they went to Hong Kong,the one with Miss A Fei(who can speak Mandarin?) so she is not allowed to speak & CNblue Yonghwa had a fan telling the taxi driver the instruction. \n\nThe newer style is what we like especially the trio(Sukjin-Jaesuk-Jongkook). You just know the Trio can basically talk about anything from life stories to exercise to no ramen. This help to reduce Jihyo to be more open as she is usually very reserved. This format won't force her to speak,but she will butt in when it is related to her. Also these help Sechan & Somin who are talkative.\n\nThere are pros & cons for the current concept. Safety is minimal priority nowadays & so the games/topic need to be harder.",

I watched that episode for SJ but after watching that I started watching the show on regular basis and became a fan.\n\nIt was then when I waited for newer episodes, i started watching episodes from yester years and then to the very beginning. That was the era man. From the 1st episode to the 2015 episodes the show is crazy funny, and the cast members look young, feel young. They were crazy funny back then.\nIt perfectly justified the image of urban action variety genre of the show. First episode has become a memory now. Whenever I want, i go to the first episode and watch it.\n\nThe first five years are really great. They are too much comic, the action variety content is great, role-play, slapstick comedy is fun to watch, and it carries the essence of Korea. And last to mention but importantly the guest line were terrific. I got so much familiar with the celebrities of Korea. The guest line was great too. \n\nRecent episodes are really bad in my opinion. I don't like them that much and don't even watch much now. Only sometimes.",

Absolutely. \n\nAre the current episodes not as good compared to the oldies? Thats up to each persons perspective. For me there are alot of recent episodes that left me mfing crying, asthma acting up, rewinding the scenes over and over.\n\nAnd you have to remember the cast is obviously much older and have gained some serious injuries over the past decade.

I\u2019m happy for him though. RM will always hold a special place in my heart. \ud83d\udc9b",

I think he is playing it safe not to force himself considering RM took a toll on him.\n\nI think it was also a good decision by Kwangsoo.He can always come back later on kinda like Cha Tae Hyun/Yoo Hae Jin appearing on variety show,now hosting program although not a big one. \n\nIt a new challenge for him to prove that he is not just playing a funny guy,but can take on serious role however i think he still need to do better on his expression. I think it how we often visualised him as 'no matter what role he act,it still funny' even if his character is an evil murderer.\n\n\nI would definitely want to see him 10/15 years later in a variety show in a talk show(kinda like what Hyori bed & breakfast) except no guest. The cast would be YJS(hopefully he is still around)/Jongkook with Kwangsoo. Guest may occasionally be invited by them personally.",

Even tho LKS left and left huge hole in RM (no sudden betrayal, no watchable punishment except YJS, YSC and JSM taking it) and recent episodes i realised since covid they rarely interact with public as they are before mid of 2020 and I missing it so much.\n\nHope RM with Hung In as 1st female PD leading RM, RM can get much better even when the cast isnt as young as the time before. So far I liked her interaction with RM members since RM member always try to bargain with her so much and seeing her also get tired togerther with member remind me of early RM crew.",

That Justin Bieber hairstyle also wasn't working for him. LKS is the other one who looks better, but I guess that is to be expected wasn't he like barely 25? \n\nAlso, Haha has so much swag so I always find him attractive. Before and now.

When he is funny it's only accidentally or because he was set up perfectly by YJS, KJK or some other cast member. \n\nOR when he's the butt of the joke and it's at his expense. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd I say annoying because he's just so fake. They're always talking about how fake he is. He doesn't do anything unless it's for his benefit. Like he isn't \"energetic\" or a\" team player\" until the cameras are on. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven in the early years, he always coveted being the main draw of the show but he just isn't. If elimination is the name of the game, he's usually the first one out. He's the most out of shape (which is why he targets women, b/c he thinks he'll have the edge), the laziest, the one that gripes the most, the one that tries to get the producers to edit him so he comes out in a good light, etc. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven when KJK invited YJS over to his YT channel and he was just a guest (at YJS behest) he still was trying to get as much camera time as possible (oh yeah and he stole/copied an idea that KJK and YJS said they wanted to do on YT in the future). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just get annoyed by his opportunistic, selfish, egotistical ways and it baffles me that YJS sees him as such a good friend. Maybe there's a reason for that off camera. But everything that I've seen on RM, YT, and How do you play just keeps cementing in my mind how self-centered and selfish he is and I wouldn't be  sad if he left the show or got replaced. But that's just me lol.",

I find that much more annoying than JSJ doing it. If you're weak, it makes sense to go after someone equally as weak or a little weaker. That's the only option that makes sense. But if you're KJK, you can pretty much have your pick out of 3-4 others, so why does he feel the need to target the easy members? \n\nAbout the rest of your issues with him, I think that is genuinely his variety character. Him joking about editing and screentime and closeup is for show, and we don't know the real person behind this character.",

My point is JSJ does it 10 out of 10 times. It\u2019s predictable. He\u2019s been doing it for 10 years straight. And when Jeon So Min joined the cast she\u2019s been his number 1 target. \n\nSong Jihyo has bested SJS a few times.

From what I've seen of other members about him, they only have nice things to say too. So I won't judge. I'm fine with character on the show too. \n\nAlso, when I used the word \"all the time\" I didn't mean it literally every single time. But many times, it has happened that KJK or LKS go after women or JSJ when they really don't needed to. This means they got eliminated early and didn't get screentime during those games. Actually one reason I'm glad the nametag game isn't around anymore! I really didn't like how unfair it was because it was pretty much impossible to win against LKS, YJS and KJK. It just wasn't fun when you knew exactly who was going to last the shortest amount time and who was gonna probably win. \n\nI don't mind him going after JSM either. I appreciate their father daughter dynamic as it's wholesome and cute. He also avoids SJH probably because of her fanatic fans, as he has actually said so during the show! So that just leaves JSM, and I'm all for it seeing them go at it. It's usually very hilarious too.\n\nEdit: but he's my third favorite member, so I'm probably biased. I can almost never find fault with my ultimate trio of JSM-YJS-JSJ. \ud83d\ude01 (And LKS when he was around)",

Imagine something goes wrong,who going to answer towards the members family. My favourite mission was when they went to Hong Kong,the one with Miss A Fei(who can speak Mandarin?) so she is not allowed to speak & CNblue Yonghwa had a fan telling the taxi driver the instruction. \n\nThe newer style is what we like especially the trio(Sukjin-Jaesuk-Jongkook). You just know the Trio can basically talk about anything from life stories to exercise to no ramen. This help to reduce Jihyo to be more open as she is usually very reserved. This format won't force her to speak,but she will butt in when it is related to her. Also these help Sechan & Somin who are talkative.\n\nThere are pros & cons for the current concept. Safety is minimal priority nowadays & so the games/topic need to be harder.",

Absolutely. \n\nAre the current episodes not as good compared to the oldies? Thats up to each persons perspective. For me there are alot of recent episodes that left me mfing crying, asthma acting up, rewinding the scenes over and over.\n\nAnd you have to remember the cast is obviously much older and have gained some serious injuries over the past decade.

I think he is playing it safe not to force himself considering RM took a toll on him.\n\nI think it was also a good decision by Kwangsoo.He can always come back later on kinda like Cha Tae Hyun/Yoo Hae Jin appearing on variety show,now hosting program although not a big one. \n\nIt a new challenge for him to prove that he is not just playing a funny guy,but can take on serious role however i think he still need to do better on his expression. I think it how we often visualised him as 'no matter what role he act,it still funny' even if his character is an evil murderer.\n\n\nI would definitely want to see him 10/15 years later in a variety show in a talk show(kinda like what Hyori bed & breakfast) except no guest. The cast would be YJS(hopefully he is still around)/Jongkook with Kwangsoo. Guest may occasionally be invited by them personally.",

That Justin Bieber hairstyle also wasn't working for him. LKS is the other one who looks better, but I guess that is to be expected wasn't he like barely 25? \n\nAlso, Haha has so much swag so I always find him attractive. Before and now. Now more so.\n\nI kinda think they're all good looking, even YSC. He cleans up pretty well and he's manly so I find him attractive.

They're always talking about how fake he is. He doesn't do anything unless it's for his benefit. Like he isn't \"energetic\" or a\" team player\" until the cameras are on. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven in the early years, he always coveted being the main draw of the show but he just isn't. If elimination is the name of the game, he's usually the first one out. He's the most out of shape (which is why he targets women, b/c he thinks he'll have the edge), the laziest, the one that gripes the most, the one that tries to get the producers to edit him so he comes out in a good light, etc. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven when KJK invited YJS over to his YT channel and he was just a guest (at YJS behest) he still was trying to get as much camera time as possible (oh yeah and he stole/copied an idea that KJK and YJS said they wanted to do on YT in the future). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just get annoyed by his opportunistic, selfish, egotistical ways and it baffles me that YJS sees him as such a good friend. Maybe there's a reason for that off camera. But everything that I've seen on RM, YT, and How do you play just keeps cementing in my mind how self-centered and selfish he is and I wouldn't be  sad if he left the show or got replaced.

But if you're KJK, you can pretty much have your pick out of 3-4 others, so why does he feel the need to target the easy members? \n\nAbout the rest of your issues with him, I think that is genuinely his variety character. Him joking about editing and screentime and closeup is for show, and we don't know the real person behind this character.",

My point is JSJ does it 10 out of 10 times. It\u2019s predictable. He\u2019s been doing it for 10 years straight. And when Jeon So Min joined the cast she\u2019s been his number 1 target. \n\nSong Jihyo has bested SJS a few times.

From what I've seen of other members about him, they only have nice things to say too. So I won't judge. I'm fine with character on the show too. \n\nAlso, when I used the word \"all the time\" I didn't mean it literally every single time. But many times, it has happened that KJK or LKS go after women or JSJ when they really don't needed to. This means they got eliminated early and didn't get screentime during those games. Actually one reason I'm glad the nametag game isn't around anymore! I really didn't like how unfair it was because it was pretty much impossible to win against LKS, YJS and KJK. It just wasn't fun when you knew exactly who was going to last the shortest amount time and who was gonna probably win. \n\nI don't mind him going after JSM either. I appreciate their father daughter dynamic as it's wholesome and cute. He also avoids SJH probably because of her fanatic fans, as he has actually said so during the show! So that just leaves JSM, and I'm all for it seeing them go at it. It's usually very hilarious too.\n\nEdit: but he's my third favorite member, so I'm probably biased. I can almost never find fault with my ultimate trio of JSM-YJS-JSJ. \ud83d\ude01 (And LKS when he was around)",

My favourite mission was when they went to Hong Kong,the one with Miss A Fei(who can speak Mandarin?) so she is not allowed to speak & CNblue Yonghwa had a fan telling the taxi driver the instruction. \n\nThe newer style is what we like especially the trio(Sukjin-Jaesuk-Jongkook). You just know the Trio can basically talk about anything from life stories to exercise to no ramen. This help to reduce Jihyo to be more open as she is usually very reserved. This format won't force her to speak,but she will butt in when it is related to her. Also these help Sechan & Somin who are talkative.\n\nThere are pros & cons for the current concept.

I think it how we often visualised him as 'no matter what role he act,it still funny' even if his character is an evil murderer.\n\n\nI would definitely want to see him 10/15 years later in a variety show in a talk show(kinda like what Hyori bed & breakfast) except no guest. The cast would be YJS(hopefully he is still around)/Jongkook with Kwangsoo. Guest may occasionally be invited by them personally.",

That Justin Bieber hairstyle also wasn't working for him. LKS is the other one who looks better, but I guess that is to be expected wasn't he like barely 25? \n\nAlso, Haha has so much swag so I always find him attractive. Before and now. Now more so.\n\nI kinda think they're all good looking, even YSC. He cleans up pretty well and he's manly so I find him attractive. JSM is a total goddess to me, like top 2 most beautiful Korean women (#1 is Kim Minji from Dreamcatcher https://i.imgur.com/5gO8EJQ_d.webp?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium ) \n\nEdit for link",

But if you're KJK, you can pretty much have your pick out of 3-4 others, so why does he feel the need to target the easy members? \n\nAbout the rest of your issues with him, I think that is genuinely his variety character.

My point is JSJ does it 10 out of 10 times. It\u2019s predictable. He\u2019s been doing it for 10 years straight. And when Jeon So Min joined the cast she\u2019s been his number 1 target. \n\nSong Jihyo has bested SJS a few times.

From what I've seen of other members about him, they only have nice things to say too. So I won't judge. I'm fine with character on the show too. \n\nAlso, when I used the word \"all the time\" I didn't mean it literally every single time. But many times, it has happened that KJK or LKS go after women or JSJ when they really don't needed to. This means they got eliminated early and didn't get screentime during those games. Actually one reason I'm glad the nametag game isn't around anymore! I really didn't like how unfair it was because it was pretty much impossible to win against LKS, YJS and KJK. It just wasn't fun when you knew exactly who was going to last the shortest amount time and who was gonna probably win. \n\nI don't mind him going after JSM either. I appreciate their father daughter dynamic as it's wholesome and cute. He also avoids SJH probably because of her fanatic fans, as he has actually said so during the show! So that just leaves JSM, and I'm all for it seeing them go at it. It's usually very hilarious too.\n\nEdit: but he's my third favorite member, so I'm probably biased. I can almost never find fault with my ultimate trio of JSM-YJS-JSJ. \ud83d\ude01 (And LKS when he was around)",

My point is JSJ does it 10 out of 10 times. It\u2019s predictable. He\u2019s been doing it for 10 years straight. And when Jeon So Min joined the cast she\u2019s been his number 1 target. \n\nSong Jihyo has bested SJS a few times. (I think even in a mud flats episode where you had to throw the other opponent to the ground), so he doesn\u2019t go after her. But Jeon SoMin he goes for her with a Cheshire grin.",
