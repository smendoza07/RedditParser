I\u2019ve seen quite a few articles where people are surprised working with him that he is nothing like that and totally professional.\n\nTwo, I\u2019m guessing due to advancing age and experience and general wariness about injuries, they really pick their spots on when to go all out physically. That and the show PD is more careful not to have too many physical activities now and  careful about the type of activities.",

On camera, he's the Icon of Betrayal and Avatar of the God of Variety. But most of that was developed by the PDs, YJS and careful editing.\n\nRemember that he had the Framer role for a little while, and he even came across as a rude junior sometimes before they pivoted more into the fool role and made him a sidekick to JSJ, YJS and KJK at different times. While he's long had the hapless, unlucky role, someone early on realized he could pull off being a cheater without being hated for it (probably Yoo Jae Suk realized, as he was the chief mentor). It was also probably due to his unlucky character, as he's pitiful when his attempts to cheat fail. People just kind of chuckle about it and waggle their finger. (Remember the \"Cheaters get hit\" joke a few years ago?)\n\nKwang Soo studied variety under YJS, JSJ and KJK, in particular, and found his niche. And while he played a character that was often at odds with KJK on camera, off camera, KJK would describe him as a close friend and said LKS was the one member he'd loan money to without hesitation. He also was a member that female idols didn't want to be paired with at first, a loser, but then word got around (including through Ji Hyo, who took idols under her wing) that LKS would take care of you on set. I mean, he is an actor, after all. He shows us what he wants to for the sake of entertainment. And he's won awards because of it.",

Granted, he usually intended to betray them eventually.\n\nLook no further than the last episode for an example of Kwang Soo being labeled a betrayer **after** he was betrayed first. Jae Suk's team agrees not to shoot him if he gives them ammo. He does. He's showing them his side/back as they try to hold off the other team. Jae Suk looks over, shoots one of Kwang Soo's balloons. Kwang Soo realizes he's not safe there, retreats past them out the door, and then shoots them in the back. Jae Suk, and the show's caption, then exclaim about Kwang Soo betraying them and now he's wanted. He literally was betrayed first by someone who promised not to shoot him. He really needs to stop believing he can bribe people, as they always take his money/ammo and then just vote against him anyway.",

Because he screws it up or gets unlucky.\n\nIn the RM vs episodes, they all count on him to betray (famously with the flag in the Shinhwa episode), but most of them have been successful spies and betrayers more often. That's part of the charm of the betrayal trio. 2 of them (LKS and JSJ) just aren't very good at betrayal, but they'll always try it in order to beat the more skilled members like YJS and KJK. And Ha Ha will betray when he knows there'll be consequences or it'll hurt his chances to win. Just can't help himself.",

Other members and often guests wouldn\u2019t want to align with him and would sometimes think something bad of him even though he didn\u2019t do anything wrong, resulting to him getting eliminated by accident. \n\nHH: I think Haha is better than you think. He\u2019s great at making alliances and most of the time, is pretty trusted, especially by LKS and KJK. I mean, using KJK as your meat shield, is the ultimate power move. He often betrays people but he doesn\u2019t have that big traitor image like LKS, which is a huge plus.\n\nKJK: KJK is more than just muscle. I think he\u2019s very perceptive and has good sense of most games. He also has this loyal image, so people tend to trust him and use him as their shield. One weakness, however, is his threat level. Other members would always want to take him out because he gets harder to eliminated the further the game goes. So most of the time, the rest of the group excluding KJK would gang up and eliminate him as soon as possible.\n\nJSJ: I think you should add \u201cweak at physical challenges\u201d to his weakness. He\u2019s fit for his age but he just can\u2019t compete against his younger colleagues.\n\nSJH: Survivability is another strength of hers. She rarely gets eliminated first and often reach the endgame due to her being under the radar most of the time and aligning herself with the likes of KJK and YJS. She has a loyal image like KJK, so people tend to trust her.  She can also hold out on her own without relying much on others.",

However, like you said, similar to YSC, she doesn\u2019t take risks as much as the likes of HH or LKS, so she usually doesn\u2019t have an epic win. But she does pull her weight and have a \u201cwinning\u201d mindset instead of a \u201csurviving\u201d one, which is always good to have when teamed up with her.\n\nDisclaimer: I\u2019m also speaking from the OG7 perspective, so pardon me if I didn\u2019t include YSC and JSM in my analysis.

She usually lasts until 50% of them are eliminated, at the very least.

I think you should watch some earlier episodes because Gary\u2019s an overall great player and I think you\u2019ll like how he play. His strengths are that he\u2019s physically fit but not like KJK to be a called a massive threat, he\u2019s good at random games that are not strength based but rather more on skills, he\u2019s loyal so making alliances is very easy for him (having SJH as a lock for an alliance most of the time), and is a team player (doesn\u2019t usually think of personal victories). On the other hand, he has a lot of weaknesses. He cannot lie so it\u2019s difficult for him to pull off spy missions. He is also oblivious and loyal to a fault so he is easily betrayed by LKS, HH and even SJH. He doesn\u2019t have a good grasp of some of the games and is often left dumbfounded. And ofc SJH, his biggest weakness lol.",

Sechan doesn't really have a clearly defined variety character yet and the ways for him to get one that isn't already taken, like goofy or childish, are by being the \"smart one\" (which he kind of already blew by not knowing any difficult words and thinking Hellen Keller was a nurse) or through the Somin-Sechan love line, like Monday Couple.",

I believe all members see him as a threat most of the time when they're spies because he's always quick to pick on who acts suspicious. They mentioned it oftentimes.\n\n>he often picks a random person that he thinks is the spy at the beginning of the mission and sticks with it till the end, even if it\u2019s clearly wrong\n\nPicks a random person? Uhm lmao I don't think so. Eventhough I agree that he sometimes sticks to his first guess until the end, his basis are reasonable most of the time. Example for the 10th anniv ep, he pushed for YJS being the spy because YSC was great for manipulating the truth to point out that it was YJS who was lying.\n\n>he\u2019s way too stubborn for no reason at all\n\nHe's stubborn yes, but for no reason at all?

The top three strategists in RM are YJS, KJK and Haha. JSJ is also good, but his variety character often doesn't let him play that part.\n\nYJS is good with deductions. You can also see it in his other shows. He is a good judge of character, but sometimes messes up when he is the spy.  KJK is great at deductions and often figures out if someone is behaving abnormally. Sometimes that makes him suspect people unnecessarily, but much of it what he does is to give flair to his RM character. He trusts people close to him after countless betrayals as that is part of his loyal RM character. Being stubborn and authoritative has also been part of his RM character. It adds to the fun when people challenge or go up against him.\n\nHaha is by far the best at deductions. He gets most of them right compared to the others though he often doesn't get as much credit as he deserves. In terms of strategy, YJS and KJK are better. But if Haha is given a leadership role in a rookie team, he often leads them to victory.",

I've watched this show for almost 8 years, since I was a kid. Also, lots of people are saying that KJK's weakness is trusting some people too much- sometimes he puts his full trust in one member, like Haha, and gets absolutely blindsided when he finds out that he is the spy. Remember that time when he ignored Haha for like two weeks because KJK trusted him but he turned out to be the spy? What I'm saying is that sometimes he trusts people too much and other times he's too suspicious of them, which sometimes tends to blow up in his face when he realizes that everyone on RM is excellent at lying and tricking people.",

A couple years ago, they had 2 Olympians on, and you could see the point when they both saw how well KJK was doing (box jumps and foot race) and they started actually trying harder instead of being casual, not wanting to be shown up. They could still beat him, but they clearly didn't realize how athletic the 40+ year old singer is. 10 years of Running Man and guests still get surprised at his strength, as they probably thought all the stories were exaggerations and that the editing just made him look good.",

He has been exaggerating how bad he is at it from last year to create a new funny character. JSJ's character on RM is selfish, but if you look closely, he often lets other members win. SJH is great when it comes to guessing the spy, but isn't really great as a spy. Most times, members pretend like they don't know she is the spy until the last minute. LKS, while he has an unlucky streak on RM, is pretty good at deductions if they allow him to talk. Most often, YJS shuts him up. He is someone who always guesses it right whenever KJK is the spy. He can win if he wants to, but consciously fails or messes it up to make it funnier. When it comes to deductions, KJK is one of the top two in the team and has most often gotten the spy right  than wrong in these 500 odd episodes. Being stubborn at picking the wrong guy over a grudge is a character he has developed in the past 2 to 3 years. It  goes along with his loyal character on RM and gives him more room to play out his character's favouritism and prejudice. Haha is the most underrated when it comes to strategy and mindgames. He is the only person who can successfully fool both YJS and KJK. It is not because others favour him, but he almost always has a Plan B for every occasion. Many of the RM characters of the members have changed over the years. It also has to be kept in mind that most often they purposely play dumb to make things exciting for the viewers.\n\nSo Min has a good instinct about the spy, but doesn't follow it through when making the final guess. But there was an episode where she fooled everyone throwing tantrums about not being on the same team as the male guest. Se Chan is not that bad with deduction, but hasn't got the same limelight as some of the others. He is rarely given a spy mission and since his character on RM is not close to the top of the food chain, he gets overpowered in these games based on RM character logic.",

                    "body": "I haven't seen many fans talking about this, but I definitely feel the RM character logic plays a big part in deciding who wins in the spy games: If YJS goes against LKS in a spy game, YJS will always win. If YJS goes against KJK, the vote is split. If it is YJS and KJK against the others, most often the duo will win. If it is JSJ or LKS against the others, they will fail miserably. JSJ's character has got upgraded under this PD, so he gets to win more. I think it is something he has earned over the years. But even there, some character logic will come into play. JSJ is unlikely to win single-handedly against KJK or YJS in a mindgame even if he is one step ahead of them, but if he is paired with one of them, he will win. LKS's character is set to fail in a spy game from the start unless he is paired with YJS. \n\nSJH's character was geared to win in much of early RM even when she wasn't as physically strong or strategic as the others as she was the strong badasss woman character.  It was after Chul Min PD came on board that some of the obvious scripting of her character winning  against the others changed. Still, there are chances of her winning more in a spy game as she represents a strong RM character and can deduct reasonably well.  In a lot of early RM, if it was Monday couple in a death match against the others, they would often win. Part of it was because they worked well together and part of it was the RM character logic. That also holds true when Spartace goes against the other characters lower down the food chain. Haha's trickster character has always been one that has possibilities of winning and losing. But he is one of the best when it comes to covering his tracks as the spy and is allowed to pull off dramatic wins. Se Chan is still a small fry in terms of RM's character graph nor does he have as much experience. So while he gets to play the spy, his character doesn't get as much support from the PDs or other members. It might change if he performs well and gets a character upgrade.",

            "body": "Haven\u2019t watched recent episodes of RM but used to follow them back in the day. So no Somin/Sechan experience here. \n\nKeep in mind a lot of the guys do hold back a lot when it comes to playing games. There was an old episode where they were running around this huge area, and one of the male guests was commenting how all of the cast members are so damm fit while panting heavily lol. \n\nYJS often acts weak, but he\u2019s really athletic. There was an ep where he casually did a bunch of pull ups without looking winded while the more junior guests just stared on in amazement. Even in physical contests, if he\u2019s trying he\u2019ll usually win over most male guests unless they\u2019re crazy strong. It\u2019s just his nemesis KJK (though they\u2019re really good buds, YJS started gymming because of influence from KJK from working together previously lol), which is more for the laughs than actual physical contests. \n\nHaha holds himself back *a lot* for comedic value because his character\u2019s the cheeky guy, so he doesn\u2019t even gun for the win most of the time. But there was a time his wife came on for a \u2018couple\u2019 episode (honestly one of my favs - ep 251) and he truly gave his all throughout. He outlasted *Gary* in a physical contest (KJK was sitting out due to injury), and we know Mr Random Capable is no slouch when it comes to physical games. \n\nJSJ shines when the game doesn\u2019t involve anything athletic, probably because of his talk show background. I know I didn\u2019t like him in the past because he kept losing, but over the years I could appreciate him more and more (if he gets screen time). Even when he loses, it\u2019s usually in an entertaining way. When they show off what was going on among the guys who\u2019ve been eliminated, he\u2019s basically holding a talkshow lol. \n\nKJK is amazing at games, and usually the first one to pick up on something weird (or at least, the editing would lead us to believe he\u2019s the first to raise suspicion). He isn\u2019t as good at ad-libbing etc though on his own, but shines when paired with someone. But yeah, when it comes to games this guy wins everyone else hands down, that\u2019s why they always plot to get him out first. \n\nLKS is an unexpected variety prodigy, in fact he was brought on as SJK\u2019s friend initially but of course he turned out to be the embodiment of chaotic energy. (Lucky he did his national service early when his career haven\u2019t taken off yet lol, so no disruptions unlike his buddy SJK.). He\u2019s very in shape, he\u2019s also gym buddies with KJK & there\u2019s also pictures of his topless body online... anyway, it\u2019s really cool how he became one of the top choices for partners by guests. He wins in games (by any means necessary thanks to his persona onscreen), he\u2019s capable, and also very much a gentleman. (If you pay attention to what goes on in the background of scenes, you\u2019d see that considerate behaviour on display without attention being called to it.) There has been multiple instances of female guests fangirling over wanting to be partners with him at the start lol. \n\nSJH... extremely biased here but she was the cast member I immediately took a liking to from her first appearance & still love watching her a decade later. She\u2019s good at games, but the editing often doesn\u2019t really show that too much. But she is similar to KJK in terms of being good at games but not great at being entertaining in terms of ad-libs, although she\u2019s often unintentionally funny (sleeping on top of an unstable jenga tower is *iconic* at this point). Even among girls she\u2019s really in shape & great at games. There\u2019s a reason she got called Gold Jihyo at one point because whenever the prizes included gold she\u2019ll usually win. \n\nUltimately I realised over the years that it didn\u2019t matter who wins at the games. These guys are entertainers, and would prioritise making goofs midgame over actually trying to win. Their differences in capabilities during a game is what makes this cast so special to watch for me.",

While he's long had the hapless, unlucky role, someone early on realized he could pull off being a cheater without being hated for it (probably Yoo Jae Suk realized, as he was the chief mentor). It was also probably due to his unlucky character, as he's pitiful when his attempts to cheat fail. People just kind of chuckle about it and waggle their finger. (Remember the \"Cheaters get hit\" joke a few years ago?)\n\nKwang Soo studied variety under YJS, JSJ and KJK, in particular, and found his niche. And while he played a character that was often at odds with KJK on camera, off camera, KJK would describe him as a close friend and said LKS was the one member he'd loan money to without hesitation. He also was a member that female idols didn't want to be paired with at first, a loser, but then word got around (including through Ji Hyo, who took idols under her wing) that LKS would take care of you on set. I mean, he is an actor, after all. He shows us what he wants to for the sake of entertainment. And he's won awards because of it.",

Granted, he usually intended to betray them eventually.\n\nLook no further than the last episode for an example of Kwang Soo being labeled a betrayer **after** he was betrayed first. Jae Suk's team agrees not to shoot him if he gives them ammo. He does. He's showing them his side/back as they try to hold off the other team. Jae Suk looks over, shoots one of Kwang Soo's balloons. Kwang Soo realizes he's not safe there, retreats past them out the door, and then shoots them in the back. Jae Suk, and the show's caption, then exclaim about Kwang Soo betraying them and now he's wanted. He literally was betrayed first by someone who promised not to shoot him. He really needs to stop believing he can bribe people, as they always take his money/ammo and then just vote against him anyway.",

Maybe that's why his betrayer/cheater side is more recognizable than the others.",

Because he screws it up or gets unlucky.\n\nIn the RM vs episodes, they all count on him to betray (famously with the flag in the Shinhwa episode), but most of them have been successful spies and betrayers more often. That's part of the charm of the betrayal trio. 2 of them (LKS and JSJ) just aren't very good at betrayal, but they'll always try it in order to beat the more skilled members like YJS and KJK. And Ha Ha will betray when he knows there'll be consequences or it'll hurt his chances to win. Just can't help himself.",

However, like you said, similar to YSC, she doesn\u2019t take risks as much as the likes of HH or LKS, so she usually doesn\u2019t have an epic win. But she does pull her weight and have a \u201cwinning\u201d mindset instead of a \u201csurviving\u201d one, which is always good to have when teamed up with her.\n\nDisclaimer: I\u2019m also speaking from the OG7 perspective, so pardon me if I didn\u2019t include YSC and JSM in my analysis.

She usually lasts until 50% of them are eliminated, at the very least. But it\u2019s good that she\u2019s being more active now in finding clues rather than playing passively before.\n\nSo now I get why Gary\u2019s not included lol. I think you should watch some earlier episodes because Gary\u2019s an overall great player and I think you\u2019ll like how he play. His strengths are that he\u2019s physically fit but not like KJK to be a called a massive threat, he\u2019s good at random games that are not strength based but rather more on skills, he\u2019s loyal so making alliances is very easy for him (having SJH as a lock for an alliance most of the time), and is a team player (doesn\u2019t usually think of personal victories). On the other hand, he has a lot of weaknesses. He cannot lie so it\u2019s difficult for him to pull off spy missions. He is also oblivious and loyal to a fault so he is easily betrayed by LKS, HH and even SJH. He doesn\u2019t have a good grasp of some of the games and is often left dumbfounded. And ofc SJH, his biggest weakness lol.",

Sechan doesn't really have a clearly defined variety character yet and the ways for him to get one that isn't already taken, like goofy or childish, are by being the \"smart one\" (which he kind of already blew by not knowing any difficult words and thinking Hellen Keller was a nurse) or through the Somin-Sechan love line, like Monday Couple.",

I believe all members see him as a threat most of the time when they're spies because he's always quick to pick on who acts suspicious. They mentioned it oftentimes.\n\n>he often picks a random person that he thinks is the spy at the beginning of the mission and sticks with it till the end, even if it\u2019s clearly wrong\n\nPicks a random person? Uhm lmao I don't think so. Eventhough I agree that he sometimes sticks to his first guess until the end, his basis are reasonable most of the time. Example for the 10th anniv ep, he pushed for YJS being the spy because YSC was great for manipulating the truth to point out that it was YJS who was lying.\n\n>he\u2019s way too stubborn for no reason at all\n\nHe's stubborn yes, but for no reason at all?

JSJ is also good, but his variety character often doesn't let him play that part.\n\nYJS is good with deductions. You can also see it in his other shows. He is a good judge of character, but sometimes messes up when he is the spy.  KJK is great at deductions and often figures out if someone is behaving abnormally. Sometimes that makes him suspect people unnecessarily, but much of it what he does is to give flair to his RM character. He trusts people close to him after countless betrayals as that is part of his loyal RM character. Being stubborn and authoritative has also been part of his RM character. It adds to the fun when people challenge or go up against him.\n\nHaha is by far the best at deductions. He gets most of them right compared to the others though he often doesn't get as much credit as he deserves. In terms of strategy, YJS and KJK are better. But if Haha is given a leadership role in a rookie team, he often leads them to victory.",

I'm not saying that he fails at guessing who the spy is all the time, just that his strategy is pretty risky and has led to quite a few defeats. i'll see if i can find you some episodes where this happens.",

I've watched this show for almost 8 years, since I was a kid. Also, lots of people are saying that KJK's weakness is trusting some people too much- sometimes he puts his full trust in one member, like Haha, and gets absolutely blindsided when he finds out that he is the spy. Remember that time when he ignored Haha for like two weeks because KJK trusted him but he turned out to be the spy? What I'm saying is that sometimes he trusts people too much and other times he's too suspicious of them, which sometimes tends to blow up in his face when he realizes that everyone on RM is excellent at lying and tricking people.",

A couple years ago, they had 2 Olympians on, and you could see the point when they both saw how well KJK was doing (box jumps and foot race) and they started actually trying harder instead of being casual, not wanting to be shown up. They could still beat him, but they clearly didn't realize how athletic the 40+ year old singer is. 10 years of Running Man and guests still get surprised at his strength, as they probably thought all the stories were exaggerations and that the editing just made him look good.",

If YJS goes against KJK, the vote is split. If it is YJS and KJK against the others, most often the duo will win. If it is JSJ or LKS against the others, they will fail miserably. JSJ's character has got upgraded under this PD, so he gets to win more. I think it is something he has earned over the years. But even there, some character logic will come into play. JSJ is unlikely to win single-handedly against KJK or YJS in a mindgame even if he is one step ahead of them, but if he is paired with one of them, he will win. LKS's character is set to fail in a spy game from the start unless he is paired with YJS. \n\nSJH's character was geared to win in much of early RM even when she wasn't as physically strong or strategic as the others as she was the strong badasss woman character.  It was after Chul Min PD came on board that some of the obvious scripting of her character winning  against the others changed. Still, there are chances of her winning more in a spy game as she represents a strong RM character and can deduct reasonably well.  In a lot of early RM, if it was Monday couple in a death match against the others, they would often win. Part of it was because they worked well together and part of it was the RM character logic. That also holds true when Spartace goes against the other characters lower down the food chain. Haha's trickster character has always been one that has possibilities of winning and losing. But he is one of the best when it comes to covering his tracks as the spy and is allowed to pull off dramatic wins. Se Chan is still a small fry in terms of RM's character graph nor does he have as much experience. So while he gets to play the spy, his character doesn't get as much support from the PDs or other members. It might change if he performs well and gets a character upgrade.",

Despite of it, he still keeps trusting and obeying them and they take advantage of Kwang soo being their maknae and keeps making him a fool. So it's not really surprising if he became the betrayer because he is sick of always being cheated. Really love the development of its character and that's really a good back story of why is that his character now.",

Granted, he usually intended to betray them eventually.\n\nLook no further than the last episode for an example of Kwang Soo being labeled a betrayer **after** he was betrayed first. Jae Suk's team agrees not to shoot him if he gives them ammo. He does. He's showing them his side/back as they try to hold off the other team. Jae Suk looks over, shoots one of Kwang Soo's balloons. Kwang Soo realizes he's not safe there, retreats past them out the door, and then shoots them in the back. Jae Suk, and the show's caption, then exclaim about Kwang Soo betraying them and now he's wanted. He literally was betrayed first by someone who promised not to shoot him. He really needs to stop believing he can bribe people, as they always take his money/ammo and then just vote against him anyway.",

Because he screws it up or gets unlucky.\n\nIn the RM vs episodes, they all count on him to betray (famously with the flag in the Shinhwa episode), but most of them have been successful spies and betrayers more often. That's part of the charm of the betrayal trio. 2 of them (LKS and JSJ) just aren't very good at betrayal, but they'll always try it in order to beat the more skilled members like YJS and KJK. And Ha Ha will betray when he knows there'll be consequences or it'll hurt his chances to win. Just can't help himself.",

However, history can speak for itself that SJH\u2019s usually pretty integrated to the \u201cmajority\u201d of the group, meaning she doesn\u2019t get targeted first (bc that\u2019s spot is usually between LKS and JSJ lol), and she\u2019s not too big of a threat like KJK and YJS that they have to get rid of them soon after. However, like you said, similar to YSC, she doesn\u2019t take risks as much as the likes of HH or LKS, so she usually doesn\u2019t have an epic win. But she does pull her weight and have a \u201cwinning\u201d mindset instead of a \u201csurviving\u201d one, which is always good to have when teamed up with her.\n\nDisclaimer: I\u2019m also speaking from the OG7 perspective, so pardon me if I didn\u2019t include YSC and JSM in my analysis. I haven\u2019t watched new RM as much as I did the OG episodes so I don\u2019t want to speak on them unless I have a concrete idea of how they play.",

She usually lasts until 50% of them are eliminated, at the very least. But it\u2019s good that she\u2019s being more active now in finding clues rather than playing passively before.\n\nSo now I get why Gary\u2019s not included lol. I think you should watch some earlier episodes because Gary\u2019s an overall great player and I think you\u2019ll like how he play. His strengths are that he\u2019s physically fit but not like KJK to be a called a massive threat, he\u2019s good at random games that are not strength based but rather more on skills, he\u2019s loyal so making alliances is very easy for him (having SJH as a lock for an alliance most of the time), and is a team player (doesn\u2019t usually think of personal victories). On the other hand, he has a lot of weaknesses. He cannot lie so it\u2019s difficult for him to pull off spy missions. He is also oblivious and loyal to a fault so he is easily betrayed by LKS, HH and even SJH. He doesn\u2019t have a good grasp of some of the games and is often left dumbfounded. And ofc SJH, his biggest weakness lol.",

I believe all members see him as a threat most of the time when they're spies because he's always quick to pick on who acts suspicious. They mentioned it oftentimes.\n\n>he often picks a random person that he thinks is the spy at the beginning of the mission and sticks with it till the end, even if it\u2019s clearly wrong\n\nPicks a random person? Uhm lmao I don't think so. Eventhough I agree that he sometimes sticks to his first guess until the end, his basis are reasonable most of the time. Example for the 10th anniv ep, he pushed for YJS being the spy because YSC was great for manipulating the truth to point out that it was YJS who was lying.\n\n>he\u2019s way too stubborn for no reason at all\n\nHe's stubborn yes, but for no reason at all?

JSJ is also good, but his variety character often doesn't let him play that part.\n\nYJS is good with deductions. You can also see it in his other shows. He is a good judge of character, but sometimes messes up when he is the spy.  KJK is great at deductions and often figures out if someone is behaving abnormally. Sometimes that makes him suspect people unnecessarily, but much of it what he does is to give flair to his RM character. He trusts people close to him after countless betrayals as that is part of his loyal RM character. Being stubborn and authoritative has also been part of his RM character. It adds to the fun when people challenge or go up against him.\n\nHaha is by far the best at deductions. He gets most of them right compared to the others though he often doesn't get as much credit as he deserves. In terms of strategy, YJS and KJK are better. But if Haha is given a leadership role in a rookie team, he often leads them to victory.",

Maybe like 2 people are disagreeing with me, I can tell by the downvotes, but no one can say that this is a reliable strategy. Sometimes it's hard to tell who's acting suspicious and it can end in a very embarrassing defeat especially if he tried to convince others to believe him. \n\nBut i'll see if i can find you some episodes where this happens because I know it's happened quite a few times before, and I think people just don't like the fact that I'm pointing out an lesser known weakness of their favorite member or something.",

Also, lots of people are saying that KJK's weakness is trusting some people too much- sometimes he puts his full trust in one member, like Haha, and gets absolutely blindsided when he finds out that he is the spy. Remember that time when he ignored Haha for like two weeks because KJK trusted him but he turned out to be the spy? What I'm saying is that sometimes he trusts people too much and other times he's too suspicious of them, which sometimes tends to blow up in his face when he realizes that everyone on RM is excellent at lying and tricking people.",

A couple years ago, they had 2 Olympians on, and you could see the point when they both saw how well KJK was doing (box jumps and foot race) and they started actually trying harder instead of being casual, not wanting to be shown up. They could still beat him, but they clearly didn't realize how athletic the 40+ year old singer is. 10 years of Running Man and guests still get surprised at his strength, as they probably thought all the stories were exaggerations and that the editing just made him look good.",

Jae Suk's team agrees not to shoot him if he gives them ammo. He does. He's showing them his side/back as they try to hold off the other team. Jae Suk looks over, shoots one of Kwang Soo's balloons. Kwang Soo realizes he's not safe there, retreats past them out the door, and then shoots them in the back. Jae Suk, and the show's caption, then exclaim about Kwang Soo betraying them and now he's wanted. He literally was betrayed first by someone who promised not to shoot him. He really needs to stop believing he can bribe people, as they always take his money/ammo and then just vote against him anyway.",

That's part of the charm of the betrayal trio. 2 of them (LKS and JSJ) just aren't very good at betrayal, but they'll always try it in order to beat the more skilled members like YJS and KJK. And Ha Ha will betray when he knows there'll be consequences or it'll hurt his chances to win. Just can't help himself.",

I think you should watch some earlier episodes because Gary\u2019s an overall great player and I think you\u2019ll like how he play. His strengths are that he\u2019s physically fit but not like KJK to be a called a massive threat, he\u2019s good at random games that are not strength based but rather more on skills, he\u2019s loyal so making alliances is very easy for him (having SJH as a lock for an alliance most of the time), and is a team player (doesn\u2019t usually think of personal victories). On the other hand, he has a lot of weaknesses. He cannot lie so it\u2019s difficult for him to pull off spy missions. He is also oblivious and loyal to a fault so he is easily betrayed by LKS, HH and even SJH. He doesn\u2019t have a good grasp of some of the games and is often left dumbfounded. And ofc SJH, his biggest weakness lol.",

He is a good judge of character, but sometimes messes up when he is the spy.  KJK is great at deductions and often figures out if someone is behaving abnormally. Sometimes that makes him suspect people unnecessarily, but much of it what he does is to give flair to his RM character. He trusts people close to him after countless betrayals as that is part of his loyal RM character. Being stubborn and authoritative has also been part of his RM character. It adds to the fun when people challenge or go up against him.\n\nHaha is by far the best at deductions. He gets most of them right compared to the others though he often doesn't get as much credit as he deserves. In terms of strategy, YJS and KJK are better. But if Haha is given a leadership role in a rookie team, he often leads them to victory.",

Also, lots of people are saying that KJK's weakness is trusting some people too much- sometimes he puts his full trust in one member, like Haha, and gets absolutely blindsided when he finds out that he is the spy. Remember that time when he ignored Haha for like two weeks because KJK trusted him but he turned out to be the spy? What I'm saying is that sometimes he trusts people too much and other times he's too suspicious of them, which sometimes tends to blow up in his face when he realizes that everyone on RM is excellent at lying and tricking people.",

A couple years ago, they had 2 Olympians on, and you could see the point when they both saw how well KJK was doing (box jumps and foot race) and they started actually trying harder instead of being casual, not wanting to be shown up. They could still beat him, but they clearly didn't realize how athletic the 40+ year old singer is. 10 years of Running Man and guests still get surprised at his strength, as they probably thought all the stories were exaggerations and that the editing just made him look good.",

But it\u2019s good that she\u2019s being more active now in finding clues rather than playing passively before.\n\nSo now I get why Gary\u2019s not included lol. I think you should watch some earlier episodes because Gary\u2019s an overall great player and I think you\u2019ll like how he play. His strengths are that he\u2019s physically fit but not like KJK to be a called a massive threat, he\u2019s good at random games that are not strength based but rather more on skills, he\u2019s loyal so making alliances is very easy for him (having SJH as a lock for an alliance most of the time), and is a team player (doesn\u2019t usually think of personal victories). On the other hand, he has a lot of weaknesses. He cannot lie so it\u2019s difficult for him to pull off spy missions. He is also oblivious and loyal to a fault so he is easily betrayed by LKS, HH and even SJH. He doesn\u2019t have a good grasp of some of the games and is often left dumbfounded. And ofc SJH, his biggest weakness lol.",

I'm not saying that he fails at guessing who the spy is all the time, just that his strategy is pretty risky and has led to quite a few defeats. i'll see if i can find you some episodes where this happens.",

Also, lots of people are saying that KJK's weakness is trusting some people too much- sometimes he puts his full trust in one member, like Haha, and gets absolutely blindsided when he finds out that he is the spy. Remember that time when he ignored Haha for like two weeks because KJK trusted him but he turned out to be the spy? What I'm saying is that sometimes he trusts people too much and other times he's too suspicious of them, which sometimes tends to blow up in his face when he realizes that everyone on RM is excellent at lying and tricking people.",

A couple years ago, they had 2 Olympians on, and you could see the point when they both saw how well KJK was doing (box jumps and foot race) and they started actually trying harder instead of being casual, not wanting to be shown up. They could still beat him, but they clearly didn't realize how athletic the 40+ year old singer is. 10 years of Running Man and guests still get surprised at his strength, as they probably thought all the stories were exaggerations and that the editing just made him look good.",

Also, lots of people are saying that KJK's weakness is trusting some people too much- sometimes he puts his full trust in one member, like Haha, and gets absolutely blindsided when he finds out that he is the spy. Remember that time when he ignored Haha for like two weeks because KJK trusted him but he turned out to be the spy? What I'm saying is that sometimes he trusts people too much and other times he's too suspicious of them, which sometimes tends to blow up in his face when he realizes that everyone on RM is excellent at lying and tricking people.",

Some of the episodes where he had a different guess from the beginning but managed to guess correctly at the end: HaHa as both the diety of darkness and prophet and Jaesuk as the Bio-terrorist.

You were clearly saying his stubbornness, and his off instincts \"all the time\" make him guess the wrong spy in a comment you've typed hours ago.\n\n\n>are you sure you're okay hun? you seem to be taking this way too seriously\n\nThanks for asking. Yes, I'm perfectly fine and no, I'm not taking it \"too\" seriously but as I have a different perception from yours, I'm just explaining why I think you're wrong and I think I explained it well since you seem to already agree with me.",

Remember that time when he ignored Haha for like two weeks because KJK trusted him but he turned out to be the spy? What I'm saying is that sometimes he trusts people too much and other times he's too suspicious of them, which sometimes tends to blow up in his face when he realizes that everyone on RM is excellent at lying and tricking people.",

I do see that KJK has had some nice guesses and instincts over the years, but not as many people see how he can also get caught completely off guard and i'm just pointing that out.",

Also, lots of people are saying that KJK's weakness is trusting some people too much- sometimes he puts his full trust in one member, like Haha, and gets absolutely blindsided when he finds out that he is the spy. Remember that time when he ignored Haha for like two weeks because KJK trusted him but he turned out to be the spy? What I'm saying is that sometimes he trusts people too much and other times he's too suspicious of them, which sometimes tends to blow up in his face when he realizes that everyone on RM is excellent at lying and tricking people.",

Also, lots of people are saying that KJK's weakness is trusting some people too much- sometimes he puts his full trust in one member, like Haha, and gets absolutely blindsided when he finds out that he is the spy. Remember that time when he ignored Haha for like two weeks because KJK trusted him but he turned out to be the spy? What I'm saying is that sometimes he trusts people too much and other times he's too suspicious of them, which sometimes tends to blow up in his face when he realizes that everyone on RM is excellent at lying and tricking people.",

Also, lots of people are saying that KJK's weakness is trusting some people too much- sometimes he puts his full trust in one member, like Haha, and gets absolutely blindsided when he finds out that he is the spy. Remember that time when he ignored Haha for like two weeks because KJK trusted him but he turned out to be the spy? What I'm saying is that sometimes he trusts people too much and other times he's too suspicious of them, which sometimes tends to blow up in his face when he realizes that everyone on RM is excellent at lying and tricking people.",
