I would say it costs usually between 600$ to 1000$ per system.\n\nNow, once you got it fixed on, with either liquid adhesive or special tape, you get it cut and styled the way you want it. Then, you'd usually go back every 2 to 4 weeks to have it removed, washed thoroughly and at the same time we shave back the hair underneath, cut the sides and fix it right back.\n\nIn between appointments, you can wash it in the shower delicately without any risk (following your barber's instructions of course).",

There is definitely something to be said about the random and contrasting way in which society treats different physical traits and a weird prejudice against people that find solutions to deal with baldness. We are all insecure, and we all cope with that in some way, no reason why baldness should be an exception in which we just have to \"deal with it\". And contrarily to the comment above hints, the fact that your client alternates between the two just shows how little insecurity he has.\n\nI find this very interesting, could I ask you a few questions? \n\n1 - What is your take on chemicals for hair growth?\n2 - Is there any reason to chose this over a capillary transplant (based on the cost it seems that over time the first option would be pay off)?\n3 - Do you see an increase in the number of people using these systems?",

Then, you'd usually go back every 2 to 4 weeks to have it removed, washed thoroughly and at the same time we shave back the hair underneath, cut the sides and fix it right back.\n\nIn between appointments, you can wash it in the shower delicately without any risk (following your barber's instructions of course).",

There is definitely something to be said about the random and contrasting way in which society treats different physical traits and a weird prejudice against people that find solutions to deal with baldness. We are all insecure, and we all cope with that in some way, no reason why baldness should be an exception in which we just have to \"deal with it\". And contrarily to the comment above hints, the fact that your client alternates between the two just shows how little insecurity he has.\n\nI find this very interesting, could I ask you a few questions? \n\n1 - What is your take on chemicals for hair growth?\n2 - Is there any reason to chose this over a capillary transplant (based on the cost it seems that over time the first option would be pay off)?\n3 - Do you see an increase in the number of people using these systems?",

There is definitely something to be said about the random and contrasting way in which society treats different physical traits and a weird prejudice against people that find solutions to deal with baldness. We are all insecure, and we all cope with that in some way, no reason why baldness should be an exception in which we just have to \"deal with it\". And contrarily to the comment above hints, the fact that your client alternates between the two just shows how little insecurity he has.\n\nI find this very interesting, could I ask you a few questions? \n\n1 - What is your take on chemicals for hair growth?\n2 - Is there any reason to chose this over a capillary transplant (based on the cost it seems that over time the first option would be pay off)?\n3 - Do you see an increase in the number of people using these systems?",
