    "body": "Since that night, we had 3 dates scheduled and only went on ONE. He apologized about kicking me out and said he got nervous and freaked out. He promised to never do it again and he is more comfortable with me now. We had a scheduled date where he specifically asked me to stay over which I agreed to- but that never happened. We are no longer seeing each other. Here\u2019s how it went down. \n\nWe had a date scheduled two Saturdays ago. I woke up that morning with my period. I texted him to let him know- said I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable having sex but I could take care of him in other ways. He waits until 2 hours before our date to respond and says he wants to cancel. WTF. This is a Saturday NIGHT people!! My time is valuable....he clearly doesn\u2019t feel like it is. \n\nWe reschedule for the following Saturday. On a whim the Friday before our scheduled date he asks me to lunch which I agree to. After our impromptu lunch date, he asks if I can go back to him place for \u201cbonus money\u201d. I politely say no as I have plans for Friday night- (since I blocked off my whole Saturday night the next night for HIM) he got a little upset and I could tell he felt rejected that I didn\u2019t want to go back with him right then and there. Like no dude, I have a life and friends outside of you. \n\nSaturday rolls around. He texts me 3 times between 6:30-10am. I didn\u2019t wake up until 10:30am -so I didn\u2019t respond til around 11. His texts got progressively more aggressive \u201cgood morning\u201d to \u201chello???\u201d to \u201cokay then...guess I\u2019m your second choice.\u201d Huh???? When I finally did respond at 11 am (mind you our date is scheduled at 6pm) he says \u201cyou know what I\u2019m just not feeling it, let\u2019s cancel. I feel like you\u2019re not into me\u201d (WTF?!). So many red flags, way too much insecurity and jealousy. Just overall unattractive!!\n\nI pressed further and he said he wants something more serious than what I\u2019m looking for. He is referring to a conversation we had about me ever seeing myself dating a man much older than me. I told him specifically with him, I do not see us in a serious long term relationship because he has a vasectomy and I want to have my own biological kids one day. My thing is WHY string me along for 2 Saturdays in a row- I wasted so much time on this guy! I could have been going on other dates!!! Or made other plans!! Anything! Oh well, back to the bowl and I\u2019m steering clear of newbie SDs from now on. Only experienced SDs apply within \ud83d\ude02",

Gross! \n\nThey have no idea how sugaring works and will not provide anything that qualifies as it. They don't understand that you have to be super generous and take the considerations of adjustments to the SBs lifestyle and schedule as well to be an actual Sugar\nDaddy. It's seriously a special person that can make a good SD where both parties are happy and not every joe on the street can do it. Someone with a loose cannon schedule who wants you expects you'll see him when he snaps his fingers is not going to be an SD.\n\nThey have no idea what they're looking for but they want to get laid on the reg and lavished with attention and pay little to nothing. These are the guys that think spending a weekend alone with em on their boat in the middle of nowhere for days straight is payment enough. \"I'm a doctor, why wouldn't my company be enough for her?\". Or you accompanying them on a lame business trip for 4 days where you'll wait around for them in the hotel is acceptable. They don't even think twice at the idea you would lose $;doing this since you're missing work, pet sitting fees, etc. These guys are the ones that laugh when you tell them a reasonable amount . They've never provided for a girl like that and they don't think you're with what you know you are. RUN!!\n\nThere is an Intel station here and it's hilarious how many of the new recent phd grad engineers are looking for GFE with long commutes to them and not even weekly for no more than 2fitty. They are making false hopeful assumptions and always avoid that. \n\nYou'd have to be a complete idiot to assume SA is just another dating site, and everyone knows it isn't. The newbies make up the vast majority who go on the site thinking they can pay for a date or two (just the outing lol) and It'll earn em a long term and unpaid commitment bang maid who will be available at the drop of a hat They want GFE but make zero effort. They will demand and shine for BB because that's what a committed partner would do. The worst are the ones who haven't paid you a dime yet are getting pissy that you aren't responding fast enough (it's been as bad as 10 messages in just a few hours, like every 30 min or less), or if you aren't available on their whim. \n\nExperienced SDs, or even just a super generous strip club/ sex worker regulars, people who know how the exchange works and value your worth, never haggling or expecting more, are the only ones worthy of your time. No one has time to teach someone the games , Especially those fighting it since day 1. They think, \"well I'm different , I won't need to provide at all like those other schmucks\". No, the real schmuck is you since the others are the ones getting laid and having a fun in a satisfying relationship with someone  who actually appreciates em and is happy to get time with them.",

And if you are going to work with SDs in general, you need to understand their wake/sleep schedule first and foremost. Generally that can be determined by their work schedule, eg, what time they get up for work. Based on that knowledge, if you're not willing to facilitate communication during the hours when the SD is up, then you either need to establish, clearly, your regular hours yourself, or, not sugar.\n\nIt's pretty much like understanding how to work for a corporate executive. If you have that knowledge of how that culture works, then half the work to understand your SD, and the world he lives in, is done for you. If you're not willing to participate in that world, don't sugar.",

If it wasn\u2019t out of the blue and he\u2019s been demanding before, she needed to have set some boundaries. I make it clear to SDs that I work set hours Mon-Fri and so might not reply straight away, and haven\u2019t had any problems with neediness yet. \n\nSRs are a two way street, a SB shouldn\u2019t need to adjust her entire sleep schedule to be able to text back on demand. Both parties should be able to find a communication middle-ground, and if they can\u2019t, they should find a different SR.",
