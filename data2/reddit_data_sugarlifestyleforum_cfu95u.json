    "body": "I was speaking with a POT SD & he offered a $300 weekly allowance but he wanted to see me \u201ca lot\u201d because he also wanted to be friends. He\u2019s kind of old looking, sorta big, and generally not so attractive. \nI imagine girls wouldn\u2019t give him a second to speak to them if he were trying to freestyle. \n\n\nI\u2019m 23, asian, and my typical per meet allowance ranges from $350-$500. My last monthly allowance was $1400. \n\nWith all that being said, I figure if majority of the time it\u2019s platonic and only once per week we actually are intimate, I can live with that as it would be reliable/low maintenance/chill. So that\u2019s what I offered. \n\nThis man straight up tells me - \u201cI want unlimited access to you. No condom, seeing you multiple times per week as a friend with benefits. If you aren\u2019t sexually attracted to me then we shouldn\u2019t be speaking at all. It\u2019s always about money with you people.\u201d\n\nWithout thinking & out of anger I just replied, \u201cThere comes a point where it\u2019s just asking for too much. You are asking a young, attractive, college girl to not only enthusiastically sleep with you as many times as you want but also offer a weekly allowance that is lower than my previous per meet arrangements. This is no longer mutually beneficial. I suggest that if you\u2019re looking for true connection minus the financial aspect, you go to match or another form of dating that doesn\u2019t require you to be an SD\u201d\n\nhe got mad and got my SA account banned. Not a big deal though. \n\nI\u2019m just confused as to how some people can think SA shouldn\u2019t be so much about money. If you don\u2019t have it that\u2019s okay! don\u2019t use the site.\n\nRant over.",

A \"friend with benefits\" is not someone you have \"unlimited access to.\" FWB implies actual friendship -- you find a way to meet when it's mutually convenient. Who has \"unlimited access\" to a vanilla friend?\n\n>If you aren\u2019t sexually attracted to me then we shouldn\u2019t be speaking at all. \n\nCraving validation to the point of being toxic.
