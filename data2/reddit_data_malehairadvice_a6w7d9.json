She said it looks fine but that she couldn't see super well on the video, so I said \"great, so you're gonna re-judge me tomorrow?\" and she said \"yes, so get ready for that.\"\n\nSo we're all good. I'm gonna leave it for now, but I appreciate everyone being an advocate of me shaving it and rocking the bald/beard combo, which I will definitely do in the future at some point.\n\n---\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/4ke4jFY.jpg this is a few days ago.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/6xu9HPJ.jpg this is the last time I shaved my head, like 5 years ago",
