Obito was even telling him go rest. He would not be able to do yo her what he did to Sai when he was exhausted. He told Sakura to kill Karin because he needed to trust her in order to not get killed while recovering.\n\nSakura was so shocked by his aggression that she was paralyzed similarly to how Orochimaru paralyzed them in the Chunin exams and how he did the same to Kakashi. Sasuke did not attack Orochimaru after stabbing himself, he ran as far away as he could.\n\nAlso Kakashi told Orochimaru don't take another step or one of us will die her, activating Chidori. Orochimaru then walked away and said try it if you can. Kakashi then went, \"yo what did I just say? I must have been out of my mind\" vecause Orochinaru could have took Kakashi apart right there.",

How are you not getting this?\n\nShe didn't get tramautized for life like Kakashi, Naruto, Sasuke, the entire Akatsuki, Hashirama, Tobirama, Madara, Izuna and even Karin (she worked for Orochimaru for years and didn't care at all about what he made her do, Sasuke was actually way more moral than her at the time), so Sakura doesn't have the same ability to be ruthless when needed.\n\nThe fact is the one good thing the Naruto series consistently has going for it is character interaction and their personalities.\n\nYes Naruto's resolve squashed hers when he rejected her fake love confession. I liked that. She misjudged his character since they were toddlers basically and it blew up in her face when she found out she was wrong. High intensity emotional scenes, conflict of values, are what I like about fiction and Japanese fiction does this really well.\n\nThis was actually good writing on Kishimoto's part unlike Sasuke knowing why the Final Valley  was famous but not who Madara was. He wasn't even written out of the history books because the giant statue they made of him was still there and Obito knew of him at a younger age than Sasuke.\n\nBut I do not want all the characters to actually have the same personality unlike you apparently. I like that Sakura acted like a kunoichi but a kunoichi's skillset was not what was needed then.\n\nIt's Kishimoto's fault for not making Sakura a spy because that's where kunoichi would thrive in Naruto and did in Japan's history. Kabuto even said medical ninjas make good spies for being able to help people and women on average have more charisma than men making them good as spies.",

Maybe definitely has more potential to be one of the better story drivin fights but still a 40% one move fight where Sasuke, 40% Sasuke wins after admitting that Sakura is strong now, 20% Sakura wins in an upset but someone (idk who makes the most sense atm) saves Sasuke last minute and can't keep up with Sakura's strength and her previous fight with sauske leaves her to tired to chase after them.",

No one is saying she\u2019s awesome because she\u2019s female-or that she suck\u2019s specially because of that. We\u2019re saying that objectively speaking-she had everything to succeed but she wasn\u2019t given a purpose-like all other female characters in Naruto she falls flat. There\u2019s little depth to her. If she were a puddle and you stepped in it-you\u2019d still be dry. \n\nTrying to say anything about historically/ in real life doesn\u2019t make sense because this is a make believe world. If the laws of physics/life and death/ common sense don\u2019t exist there-why would it matter that historically/in real life to us females thrive in spy work?",

An even higher percent of fan fiction is like that.\n\nYes it is sad Kishimoto didn't give her many good scenes but if he made her a spy, she naturally would have gotten good scenes.",

Just watched Spy X Family and Anya and Yor are well written girls.\n\nYes Kishimoto did make mistakes with her but I like the core of who she is. Kishimoto also made a bunch of other mistakes like having Sasuke know why the final valley was famous but not know sho Madara was. It's not like Madara was written out of the history books, Konoha's academy just doesn't teach history which is super stupid.\n\nBut Nagato reviving all of Konoha was way worse. Just because the rules of the world are different doesn't mean it works, that deus ex machina can be used to end all conflicts which degrades the story because it's about ending wars. Ya sure would be nice if we could revive people from the dead but with technology instead of chakra magic.",

Just chasing after something you have nothing in terms of development with. Hinata and Naruto hardly had any screentime together, no time to develop a relationship or anything really. Naruto and Sakura literally had tons of moments where she showed how much she cared for him, supported him, and believed in him. They also had tons of hints throughout the series that they would make a good couple or that they would end up together.   \n\n\nIt's just bad writing to make a movie that forces to characters together that had no character development in 500 episodes. And I don't really take the Pain fight as any kind of development because if that had been any of Naruto's friends coming to his rescue and getting savagely destroyed by pain he would've raged just as hard. Why? because Naruto hates when someone stronger picks on those that are weaker, because that's how Naruto has always been. He didn't need her to come to his rescue because if things got dire, Kurama would've come out.   \n\n\nIt was just bad writing all around for who the \"big three\" got together with. And I don't think using Boruto is a good example of \"these characters work together\" because at that point they HAVE to write them properly and in a way that makes them seem like they fit together.",

Maybe I'm just not a fan of them bickering idk \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af). \n\nAnd obviously the lack of development is an issue not sugarcoating that. But I'm also someone who watched all the fillers + movies, so any moments Naru & Hina had together in those I just equate to \"time they've spent together\", but I get that it's not canon. And yeah it could've been anyone who came to the rescue during Pain, but I just feel like they picked Hinata for a reason for that. And I guess I don't really see it as stalking (at least not in a super creepy way anyway).\n\nThe point is even Kishimoto knows he could've written all their relationships better",

Kakashi also had a couple chances to kill Sasuke but he kept delaying it because he didn't want to. Once he finally decided to do it, Naruto's clone held him down. Sakura was clearly planning to kill him once she gained his trust as a medic. Sasuke slept for like 3 days after fighting Killer B so he would have to sleep after this as well. Obito was even telling him go rest. He would not be able to do yo her what he did to Sai when he was exhausted. He told Sakura to kill Karin because he needed to trust her in order to not get killed while recovering.\n\nSakura was so shocked by his aggression that she was paralyzed similarly to how Orochimaru paralyzed them in the Chunin exams and how he did the same to Kakashi. Sasuke did not attack Orochimaru after stabbing himself, he ran as far away as he could.\n\nAlso Kakashi told Orochimaru don't take another step or one of us will die her, activating Chidori. Orochimaru then walked away and said try it if you can. Kakashi then went, \"yo what did I just say? I must have been out of my mind\" vecause Orochinaru could have took Kakashi apart right there.",

How are you not getting this?\n\nShe didn't get tramautized for life like Kakashi, Naruto, Sasuke, the entire Akatsuki, Hashirama, Tobirama, Madara, Izuna and even Karin (she worked for Orochimaru for years and didn't care at all about what he made her do, Sasuke was actually way more moral than her at the time), so Sakura doesn't have the same ability to be ruthless when needed.\n\nThe fact is the one good thing the Naruto series consistently has going for it is character interaction and their personalities.\n\nYes Naruto's resolve squashed hers when he rejected her fake love confession. I liked that. She misjudged his character since they were toddlers basically and it blew up in her face when she found out she was wrong. High intensity emotional scenes, conflict of values, are what I like about fiction and Japanese fiction does this really well.\n\nThis was actually good writing on Kishimoto's part unlike Sasuke knowing why the Final Valley  was famous but not who Madara was. He wasn't even written out of the history books because the giant statue they made of him was still there and Obito knew of him at a younger age than Sasuke.\n\nBut I do not want all the characters to actually have the same personality unlike you apparently. I like that Sakura acted like a kunoichi but a kunoichi's skillset was not what was needed then.\n\nIt's Kishimoto's fault for not making Sakura a spy because that's where kunoichi would thrive in Naruto and did in Japan's history. Kabuto even said medical ninjas make good spies for being able to help people and women on average have more charisma than men making them good as spies.",

Maybe definitely has more potential to be one of the better story drivin fights but still a 40% one move fight where Sasuke, 40% Sasuke wins after admitting that Sakura is strong now, 20% Sakura wins in an upset but someone (idk who makes the most sense atm) saves Sasuke last minute and can't keep up with Sakura's strength and her previous fight with sauske leaves her to tired to chase after them.",

It's not like Madara was written out of the history books, Konoha's academy just doesn't teach history which is super stupid.\n\nBut Nagato reviving all of Konoha was way worse.

Just chasing after something you have nothing in terms of development with. Hinata and Naruto hardly had any screentime together, no time to develop a relationship or anything really. Naruto and Sakura literally had tons of moments where she showed how much she cared for him, supported him, and believed in him. They also had tons of hints throughout the series that they would make a good couple or that they would end up together.   \n\n\nIt's just bad writing to make a movie that forces to characters together that had no character development in 500 episodes. And I don't really take the Pain fight as any kind of development because if that had been any of Naruto's friends coming to his rescue and getting savagely destroyed by pain he would've raged just as hard. Why? because Naruto hates when someone stronger picks on those that are weaker, because that's how Naruto has always been. He didn't need her to come to his rescue because if things got dire, Kurama would've come out.   \n\n\nIt was just bad writing all around for who the \"big three\" got together with. And I don't think using Boruto is a good example of \"these characters work together\" because at that point they HAVE to write them properly and in a way that makes them seem like they fit together.",

But I'm also someone who watched all the fillers + movies, so any moments Naru & Hina had together in those I just equate to \"time they've spent together\", but I get that it's not canon. And yeah it could've been anyone who came to the rescue during Pain, but I just feel like they picked Hinata for a reason for that. And I guess I don't really see it as stalking (at least not in a super creepy way anyway).\n\nThe point is even Kishimoto knows he could've written all their relationships better",

Sakura was clearly planning to kill him once she gained his trust as a medic. Sasuke slept for like 3 days after fighting Killer B so he would have to sleep after this as well. Obito was even telling him go rest. He would not be able to do yo her what he did to Sai when he was exhausted. He told Sakura to kill Karin because he needed to trust her in order to not get killed while recovering.\n\nSakura was so shocked by his aggression that she was paralyzed similarly to how Orochimaru paralyzed them in the Chunin exams and how he did the same to Kakashi. Sasuke did not attack Orochimaru after stabbing himself, he ran as far away as he could.\n\nAlso Kakashi told Orochimaru don't take another step or one of us will die her, activating Chidori. Orochimaru then walked away and said try it if you can. Kakashi then went, \"yo what did I just say? I must have been out of my mind\" vecause Orochinaru could have took Kakashi apart right there.",

How are you not getting this?\n\nShe didn't get tramautized for life like Kakashi, Naruto, Sasuke, the entire Akatsuki, Hashirama, Tobirama, Madara, Izuna and even Karin (she worked for Orochimaru for years and didn't care at all about what he made her do, Sasuke was actually way more moral than her at the time), so Sakura doesn't have the same ability to be ruthless when needed.\n\nThe fact is the one good thing the Naruto series consistently has going for it is character interaction and their personalities.\n\nYes Naruto's resolve squashed hers when he rejected her fake love confession. I liked that. She misjudged his character since they were toddlers basically and it blew up in her face when she found out she was wrong. High intensity emotional scenes, conflict of values, are what I like about fiction and Japanese fiction does this really well.\n\nThis was actually good writing on Kishimoto's part unlike Sasuke knowing why the Final Valley  was famous but not who Madara was. He wasn't even written out of the history books because the giant statue they made of him was still there and Obito knew of him at a younger age than Sasuke.\n\nBut I do not want all the characters to actually have the same personality unlike you apparently. I like that Sakura acted like a kunoichi but a kunoichi's skillset was not what was needed then.\n\nIt's Kishimoto's fault for not making Sakura a spy because that's where kunoichi would thrive in Naruto and did in Japan's history. Kabuto even said medical ninjas make good spies for being able to help people and women on average have more charisma than men making them good as spies.",

Keeping in mind the last time Sasuke saw Sakura she was basically useless compared to every other ninjas of their level. Meaning that she would be underestimated heavily giving her some kind of edge in this fight. An interesting fight? Maybe definitely has more potential to be one of the better story drivin fights but still a 40% one move fight where Sasuke, 40% Sasuke wins after admitting that Sakura is strong now, 20% Sakura wins in an upset but someone (idk who makes the most sense atm) saves Sasuke last minute and can't keep up with Sakura's strength and her previous fight with sauske leaves her to tired to chase after them.",

Sakura tried to explain to Sai that Sasuke was Naruto friend as well and that was also why Naruto wanted to save Sasuke, but Sai told her that Naruto was in love with her and was basically being held hostage by the promise he made to her at the end of Part 1. \n\nSo Sakura wasn\u2019t being malicious or mean. She literally thought she had to do this to save Naruto\u2019s life. Also remember that she was planning to kill Sasuke after this, so she was literally choosing her friendship with Naruto over her feelings for Sasuke.",

It's not like Madara was written out of the history books, Konoha's academy just doesn't teach history which is super stupid.\n\nBut Nagato reviving all of Konoha was way worse.

They also had tons of hints throughout the series that they would make a good couple or that they would end up together.   \n\n\nIt's just bad writing to make a movie that forces to characters together that had no character development in 500 episodes. And I don't really take the Pain fight as any kind of development because if that had been any of Naruto's friends coming to his rescue and getting savagely destroyed by pain he would've raged just as hard. Why? because Naruto hates when someone stronger picks on those that are weaker, because that's how Naruto has always been. He didn't need her to come to his rescue because if things got dire, Kurama would've come out.   \n\n\nIt was just bad writing all around for who the \"big three\" got together with. And I don't think using Boruto is a good example of \"these characters work together\" because at that point they HAVE to write them properly and in a way that makes them seem like they fit together.",

Honestly I'm just speaking out of bias because I'm a Hinata fan (again not saying I'm a Sakura hater, I just prefer Hinata and honestly a few other female characters over her. Maybe I'm just not a fan of them bickering idk \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af). \n\nAnd obviously the lack of development is an issue not sugarcoating that. But I'm also someone who watched all the fillers + movies, so any moments Naru & Hina had together in those I just equate to \"time they've spent together\", but I get that it's not canon. And yeah it could've been anyone who came to the rescue during Pain, but I just feel like they picked Hinata for a reason for that. And I guess I don't really see it as stalking (at least not in a super creepy way anyway).\n\nThe point is even Kishimoto knows he could've written all their relationships better",

They would all been turned into zetsu or killed by Madara or Obito if any of them weren't there in the war.\n\nThere are no flaws in my argument. Kakashi also had a couple chances to kill Sasuke but he kept delaying it because he didn't want to. Once he finally decided to do it, Naruto's clone held him down. Sakura was clearly planning to kill him once she gained his trust as a medic. Sasuke slept for like 3 days after fighting Killer B so he would have to sleep after this as well. Obito was even telling him go rest. He would not be able to do yo her what he did to Sai when he was exhausted. He told Sakura to kill Karin because he needed to trust her in order to not get killed while recovering.\n\nSakura was so shocked by his aggression that she was paralyzed similarly to how Orochimaru paralyzed them in the Chunin exams and how he did the same to Kakashi. Sasuke did not attack Orochimaru after stabbing himself, he ran as far away as he could.\n\nAlso Kakashi told Orochimaru don't take another step or one of us will die her, activating Chidori. Orochimaru then walked away and said try it if you can. Kakashi then went, \"yo what did I just say? I must have been out of my mind\" vecause Orochinaru could have took Kakashi apart right there.",

How are you not getting this?\n\nShe didn't get tramautized for life like Kakashi, Naruto, Sasuke, the entire Akatsuki, Hashirama, Tobirama, Madara, Izuna and even Karin (she worked for Orochimaru for years and didn't care at all about what he made her do, Sasuke was actually way more moral than her at the time), so Sakura doesn't have the same ability to be ruthless when needed.\n\nThe fact is the one good thing the Naruto series consistently has going for it is character interaction and their personalities.\n\nYes Naruto's resolve squashed hers when he rejected her fake love confession. I liked that. She misjudged his character since they were toddlers basically and it blew up in her face when she found out she was wrong. High intensity emotional scenes, conflict of values, are what I like about fiction and Japanese fiction does this really well.\n\nThis was actually good writing on Kishimoto's part unlike Sasuke knowing why the Final Valley  was famous but not who Madara was. He wasn't even written out of the history books because the giant statue they made of him was still there and Obito knew of him at a younger age than Sasuke.\n\nBut I do not want all the characters to actually have the same personality unlike you apparently. I like that Sakura acted like a kunoichi but a kunoichi's skillset was not what was needed then.\n\nIt's Kishimoto's fault for not making Sakura a spy because that's where kunoichi would thrive in Naruto and did in Japan's history. Kabuto even said medical ninjas make good spies for being able to help people and women on average have more charisma than men making them good as spies.",

Maybe definitely has more potential to be one of the better story drivin fights but still a 40% one move fight where Sasuke, 40% Sasuke wins after admitting that Sakura is strong now, 20% Sakura wins in an upset but someone (idk who makes the most sense atm) saves Sasuke last minute and can't keep up with Sakura's strength and her previous fight with sauske leaves her to tired to chase after them.",

Just watched Spy X Family and Anya and Yor are well written girls.\n\nYes Kishimoto did make mistakes with her but I like the core of who she is. Kishimoto also made a bunch of other mistakes like having Sasuke know why the final valley was famous but not know sho Madara was. It's not like Madara was written out of the history books, Konoha's academy just doesn't teach history which is super stupid.\n\nBut Nagato reviving all of Konoha was way worse. Just because the rules of the world are different doesn't mean it works, that deus ex machina can be used to end all conflicts which degrades the story because it's about ending wars. Ya sure would be nice if we could revive people from the dead but with technology instead of chakra magic.",

But I'm also someone who watched all the fillers + movies, so any moments Naru & Hina had together in those I just equate to \"time they've spent together\", but I get that it's not canon. And yeah it could've been anyone who came to the rescue during Pain, but I just feel like they picked Hinata for a reason for that. And I guess I don't really see it as stalking (at least not in a super creepy way anyway).\n\nThe point is even Kishimoto knows he could've written all their relationships better",

How are you not getting this?\n\nShe didn't get tramautized for life like Kakashi, Naruto, Sasuke, the entire Akatsuki, Hashirama, Tobirama, Madara, Izuna and even Karin (she worked for Orochimaru for years and didn't care at all about what he made her do, Sasuke was actually way more moral than her at the time), so Sakura doesn't have the same ability to be ruthless when needed.\n\nThe fact is the one good thing the Naruto series consistently has going for it is character interaction and their personalities.\n\nYes Naruto's resolve squashed hers when he rejected her fake love confession. I liked that. She misjudged his character since they were toddlers basically and it blew up in her face when she found out she was wrong. High intensity emotional scenes, conflict of values, are what I like about fiction and Japanese fiction does this really well.\n\nThis was actually good writing on Kishimoto's part unlike Sasuke knowing why the Final Valley  was famous but not who Madara was. He wasn't even written out of the history books because the giant statue they made of him was still there and Obito knew of him at a younger age than Sasuke.\n\nBut I do not want all the characters to actually have the same personality unlike you apparently. I like that Sakura acted like a kunoichi but a kunoichi's skillset was not what was needed then.\n\nIt's Kishimoto's fault for not making Sakura a spy because that's where kunoichi would thrive in Naruto and did in Japan's history. Kabuto even said medical ninjas make good spies for being able to help people and women on average have more charisma than men making them good as spies.",

Maybe definitely has more potential to be one of the better story drivin fights but still a 40% one move fight where Sasuke, 40% Sasuke wins after admitting that Sakura is strong now, 20% Sakura wins in an upset but someone (idk who makes the most sense atm) saves Sasuke last minute and can't keep up with Sakura's strength and her previous fight with sauske leaves her to tired to chase after them.",

She literally thought she had to do this to save Naruto\u2019s life.

Kishimoto also made a bunch of other mistakes like having Sasuke know why the final valley was famous but not know sho Madara was. It's not like Madara was written out of the history books, Konoha's academy just doesn't teach history which is super stupid.\n\nBut Nagato reviving all of Konoha was way worse. Just because the rules of the world are different doesn't mean it works, that deus ex machina can be used to end all conflicts which degrades the story because it's about ending wars. Ya sure would be nice if we could revive people from the dead but with technology instead of chakra magic.",

How are you not getting this?\n\nShe didn't get tramautized for life like Kakashi, Naruto, Sasuke, the entire Akatsuki, Hashirama, Tobirama, Madara, Izuna and even Karin (she worked for Orochimaru for years and didn't care at all about what he made her do, Sasuke was actually way more moral than her at the time), so Sakura doesn't have the same ability to be ruthless when needed.\n\nThe fact is the one good thing the Naruto series consistently has going for it is character interaction and their personalities.\n\nYes Naruto's resolve squashed hers when he rejected her fake love confession. I liked that. She misjudged his character since they were toddlers basically and it blew up in her face when she found out she was wrong. High intensity emotional scenes, conflict of values, are what I like about fiction and Japanese fiction does this really well.\n\nThis was actually good writing on Kishimoto's part unlike Sasuke knowing why the Final Valley  was famous but not who Madara was. He wasn't even written out of the history books because the giant statue they made of him was still there and Obito knew of him at a younger age than Sasuke.\n\nBut I do not want all the characters to actually have the same personality unlike you apparently. I like that Sakura acted like a kunoichi but a kunoichi's skillset was not what was needed then.\n\nIt's Kishimoto's fault for not making Sakura a spy because that's where kunoichi would thrive in Naruto and did in Japan's history. Kabuto even said medical ninjas make good spies for being able to help people and women on average have more charisma than men making them good as spies.",

Keeping in mind the last time Sasuke saw Sakura she was basically useless compared to every other ninjas of their level. Meaning that she would be underestimated heavily giving her some kind of edge in this fight. An interesting fight? Maybe definitely has more potential to be one of the better story drivin fights but still a 40% one move fight where Sasuke, 40% Sasuke wins after admitting that Sakura is strong now, 20% Sakura wins in an upset but someone (idk who makes the most sense atm) saves Sasuke last minute and can't keep up with Sakura's strength and her previous fight with sauske leaves her to tired to chase after them.",

Sakura tried to explain to Sai that Sasuke was Naruto friend as well and that was also why Naruto wanted to save Sasuke, but Sai told her that Naruto was in love with her and was basically being held hostage by the promise he made to her at the end of Part 1. \n\nSo Sakura wasn\u2019t being malicious or mean. She literally thought she had to do this to save Naruto\u2019s life. Also remember that she was planning to kill Sasuke after this, so she was literally choosing her friendship with Naruto over her feelings for Sasuke.",

Kishimoto also made a bunch of other mistakes like having Sasuke know why the final valley was famous but not know sho Madara was. It's not like Madara was written out of the history books, Konoha's academy just doesn't teach history which is super stupid.\n\nBut Nagato reviving all of Konoha was way worse. Just because the rules of the world are different doesn't mean it works, that deus ex machina can be used to end all conflicts which degrades the story because it's about ending wars.

It's not like Madara was written out of the history books, Konoha's academy just doesn't teach history which is super stupid.\n\nBut Nagato reviving all of Konoha was way worse. Just because the rules of the world are different doesn't mean it works, that deus ex machina can be used to end all conflicts which degrades the story because it's about ending wars.

Kishimoto also made a bunch of other mistakes like having Sasuke know why the final valley was famous but not know sho Madara was. It's not like Madara was written out of the history books, Konoha's academy just doesn't teach history which is super stupid.\n\nBut Nagato reviving all of Konoha was way worse. Just because the rules of the world are different doesn't mean it works, that deus ex machina can be used to end all conflicts which degrades the story because it's about ending wars. Ya sure would be nice if we could revive people from the dead but with technology instead of chakra magic.",
