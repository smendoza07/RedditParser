I finally listened to people on reddit and started reading the manga, and my love for the series was completely revived. I read it on viz.com, but idk if there is a better place. Now you can be proud of Naruto and excited about the plot",

Difference is, Boruto's story in the manga comes out very slowly.

They definitely changed the tone and made it feel like super powered people instead of ninja people, but the manga wont be much different. \n\nI definitely recommend looking online for a \"shippuden filler list\" though, and skipping any episodes that are marked as \"filler\" (episodes that dont matter and just waste time).\n\nBoruto is the show that comes _after_ Naruto Shippuden. The Boruto show is terrible, but the manga is good.\n\nSo I'd say keep watching the Naruto Shippuden anime while skipping fillers, then when you finish, start the Boruto Manga from the beginning \ud83d\udc4d",

Sure, general right-wing thought is becoming more prominent, but I see it more as a natural response to the rise of far left ideology in the past decade, even the center is considered \u201ctoo right wing\u201d to them.\n\nHonestly? The biggest problem we have in the West is our increasing inability and unwillingness to tolerate and live with people with whom we disagree with. There was a point in America where the Right, Left and Center could all co-exist peacefully thanks to the sharing of common principles and ideals, we were all Americans in the end. But with the current attack on our core institutions and the attempt to blatantly rewrite our history and culture, it is becoming an increasingly divided country at a fundamental level.\n\nAnd the solution is pretty simple in my opinion, everybody needs to put away their keyboards and cellphones and actually go out to interact with real humans, you don\u2019t understand who someone is as a person by reading their tweets, you understand them by talking to them in their day-to-day life, and you get to realize that even those people who appear to be fundamentally different to you probably have like 95% of the same values and morals as you.

People can coexist only if there isn't a desire to stamp out a segment of the population. There's much more going on that just people in the west disagreeing on the internet.

One plot in Oakland resulted in the death of a security guard.

Like self-made millionaires who have their kids live off trust funds instead of teaching them the value of working for what you have, they\u2019ll ultimately be worse off as people as a result.\n\nObviously you can\u2019t trivialize all of history, sociology and psychology into a single quote, but the reality is that there is some truth and wisdom in it.",

By excepting lower quality of a product because, \u201cit\u2019s made for children\u201d you are allowing a creator to be lazy and cut corner. You are also selling the child short of any sort of intelligence they might have as it paints the picture that you believe children are so dumb they shouldn\u2019t even try to understand or appreciate complex emotions, themes, or ideas. I could apply the \u201cit wasn\u2019t made for you argument to anything you think is written poorly because it makes criticism easy to dismiss. Overall Boruto it\u2019s a very meh show. It has highs and lows, but for many fans who were expecting another Part One Naruto it is a massive letdown. That doesn\u2019t mean fans are wrong for expecting a sequel to be good. It is a sequel. To try to judge it and enjoy it while disregarding the prequel is possible, but in the end it is not the full experience as you would then have to sacrifice any and all knowledge of the prequel and the. The story would make no sense. Feel free to enjoy Boruto. I have enjoyed some select moments of it myself, but to dismiss criticism of it saying it\u2019s meant for kids to validate your own feelings isn\u2019t an actual argument.",

They seem to forget major lessons they learned, and what little they do learn seems to be at little or no consequence to them. In fact, most deaths that have happened in Boruto are more emotionally aimed at fans of Naruto than the characters of Boruto such as Onoki. The reason I bring this up as it is the contextualized version of the joke in this comment section. The \u201clack of brutal fights\u201d Boruto has as a series compared to Part One Naruto is less a complaint that the fights aren\u2019t bloody or gore filled enough. It is that in comparison, Boruto\u2019s fights lack the substance that kept viewers of Naruto interested. Even Naruto and Sasuke vs Momoshiki did a meh job at this as such a large fight really only built and/or developed minimal character in Boruto. Development that is mostly ignored after that arc with a few mentions here in there. A \u201cbrutal fight\u201d more means a fight that has consequence and emotional meaning. \n\nI may have misunderstood your comment as your tone made it sound like you were trying to dismiss criticism of Boruto by claiming it was for kids, but that\u2019s more on me as I\u2019ve had many arguments with people over flaws in the Star Wars Sequels with them dismissing criticism as \u201cIt\u2019s a movie about space wizards meant for children\u201d. It isn\u2019t a real argument I am sick of hearing it. So I apologize if I misunderstood your tone.",

                    "body": "I forced myself to watch it and it honestly wasn\u2019t as bad as everyone was saying it was. The first few arcs were boring af but I still continued because I wanted to see what had happened to all of the characters I\u2019d grown to love. Ngl, they did Kiba and Gaara dirty and I have cried over how Kiba looks like a greasy old guy who lives in a caravan but oh well I guess. The plot of Boruto has me tripping balls but it doesn\u2019t come *close* to the trauma that the Naruto characters had to go through. I remember Boruto and Shikadai freaking out over something and thinking to myself: \n\u2018The fuck? It\u2019s a spicy burger you didn\u2019t get to eat? What kind of problem is t h a t?\u2019\nThe shows character designs are awful and just upright stupid in Sadara\u2019s case. WHY GIVE A CHARACTER WITH THE SHARINGAN G L A S S E S? She\u2019s gonna get the mangakyo and be blind asf. \nBoruto is always bitching about one thing or another but when I comes to him being pissed with Naruto I can\u2019t blame him. They made Naruto hokage like he wanted too but in return d e s t r o y e d his relationships with his family. \n\nI think I\u2019ve done enough bitching for one day, so I\u2019ll talk about what I liked.\n\nOk got to be honest, Shikadai and Mitsuki are great characters and I have no reason for it. I just love their whole vibe. The classmates of Boruto are cool enough, but I hate Sadara with a passion, like I did with Sakura. Guess it runs in the family. I never would\u2019ve expected Shino to be a teacher but I love that he gets some screen time, I\u2019ve wanted it for a while. \nI know people get angry because of Boruto\u2019s animation style but I think both styles are lively in their own way. Naruto was rough, fitting the settings and plot, and Boruto is clean and shiny, like the new, modern Konoha (you could say shiny and smooth like Boruto\u2019s brain but he has had some breakthroughs before so I\u2019ll give him credit for that). \n\n\nIn conclusion:\n\nNaruto was definitely the alpha male compared to Boruto, and the plot overall was better and some character\u2019s backstories did make me cry. Boruto hasn\u2019t had anything that has made me miserable just yet, but hopefully it will come into clutch in the future. Boruto as it\u2019s own story would be better than it continuing Naruto\u2019s story, who had already achieved his \u2018main protagonist\u2019 dream. \n\nMy personal rating: 6/10 \n\nIt is so-so. One of those shows that probably shouldn\u2019t exist but does anyway. I get to see characters I already know time to time so I keep watching.\n\nI just realised I\u2019ve written a whole-ass essay and put more effort into it that any schoolwork I\u2019ve ever had to do before.",

It feels like a soulless cash grab to keep that Naruto money rolling in. The way shippuden ended was conclusive. It tied up most of the loose ends but most importantly it showed us the protagonist achieving his dream - achieving world peace and becoming Hokage. I really wasn\u2019t wishing to see other Otsutsuki rock up and end that peace. It just shits on the satisfying ending for Naruto and just takes it back to square one which isn\u2019t what I want. I was done after shippuden had ended and the bits of Boruto that I\u2019ve sampled haven\u2019t been enough to tempt me into reinvesting myself into the Naruto-verse again for the sequel series. I\u2019m happy enough with One Piece and Boku no Hero Academia will likely find other series to follow that interest me.",

Sure, general right-wing thought is becoming more prominent, but I see it more as a natural response to the rise of far left ideology in the past decade, even the center is considered \u201ctoo right wing\u201d to them.\n\nHonestly? The biggest problem we have in the West is our increasing inability and unwillingness to tolerate and live with people with whom we disagree with. There was a point in America where the Right, Left and Center could all co-exist peacefully thanks to the sharing of common principles and ideals, we were all Americans in the end. But with the current attack on our core institutions and the attempt to blatantly rewrite our history and culture, it is becoming an increasingly divided country at a fundamental level.\n\nAnd the solution is pretty simple in my opinion, everybody needs to put away their keyboards and cellphones and actually go out to interact with real humans, you don\u2019t understand who someone is as a person by reading their tweets, you understand them by talking to them in their day-to-day life, and you get to realize that even those people who appear to be fundamentally different to you probably have like 95% of the same values and morals as you.

People can coexist only if there isn't a desire to stamp out a segment of the population. There's much more going on that just people in the west disagreeing on the internet. You have a sizable chunk of the population in the US that politicized wearing a mask, some of which think the pandemic is a hoax. You have a report coming to light that Russia has been trying to intervene in UK politics. You even have people in Poland waving Nazi flags as the country slides further to the right.

Well, again you don\u2019t have to like him, and you are perfectly within your rights to hate him in return, but he\u2019s not actually being an existential threat to you. \nHowever, if YOU then started calling for legislation and systematic changes that prevented HIM from exercising his rights (in this case freedom of speech), then it would be you who is in the wrong in that scenario.\n\nYou don\u2019t fight fire with fire, you don\u2019t take an eye for an eye, that is not how a free society functions. We fight ignorance with reason and logic, we fight injustice with virtue and ethics, we fight our deepest ideological disagreements through civil discourse and conversation, we fight lies with truth. THAT is our civic duty as moral citizens, it\u2019s the only thing we have any control over. \n\nNeither you nor I can fix the US/China tensions, or the Coronavirus, or the world economy. The only thing we have any control over is the relationships we have with the people around us, and if you can become a person who can make the lives of those around you just slightly better, then that increases the probability tremendously of creating a positive feedback loop of success for yourself and your community at large. It\u2019s not karma, it\u2019s simply stats in the end.",

There is no room to tolerate people like Richard Spencer, for instance, a man than wants \"peaceful genocide\" of \"lessers.\" These men always act in bad faith, and claim freedom of speech, whilst infiltrating the political arena to further their goals. These people will kill if given the chance. All you have to do is look at the bomb plots that thankfully were stopped in the aftermath of George Floyd. Alt-reichers planned on setting off bombs at the protests to A) Kill protesters, and B) Shift blame towards BLM to delegitimize the movement. One plot in Oakland resulted in the death of a security guard. This now goes all the way to the White House, with the president retweeting a video where a Trump supporter in a golf cart very clearly yells, \"White Power\". Not to mention the official social media pages of the vice president posting 88 ads that begin with 14 words. They can feign ignorance all they want, but they know full well what 1488 means. Jesus man, you sound like the 1936 New York Times op-ed that said Jews in Germany were hurting their cause by protesting in Germany.",

By excepting lower quality of a product because, \u201cit\u2019s made for children\u201d you are allowing a creator to be lazy and cut corner. You are also selling the child short of any sort of intelligence they might have as it paints the picture that you believe children are so dumb they shouldn\u2019t even try to understand or appreciate complex emotions, themes, or ideas. I could apply the \u201cit wasn\u2019t made for you argument to anything you think is written poorly because it makes criticism easy to dismiss. Overall Boruto it\u2019s a very meh show. It has highs and lows, but for many fans who were expecting another Part One Naruto it is a massive letdown. That doesn\u2019t mean fans are wrong for expecting a sequel to be good. It is a sequel. To try to judge it and enjoy it while disregarding the prequel is possible, but in the end it is not the full experience as you would then have to sacrifice any and all knowledge of the prequel and the. The story would make no sense. Feel free to enjoy Boruto. I have enjoyed some select moments of it myself, but to dismiss criticism of it saying it\u2019s meant for kids to validate your own feelings isn\u2019t an actual argument.",

They seem to forget major lessons they learned, and what little they do learn seems to be at little or no consequence to them. In fact, most deaths that have happened in Boruto are more emotionally aimed at fans of Naruto than the characters of Boruto such as Onoki. The reason I bring this up as it is the contextualized version of the joke in this comment section. The \u201clack of brutal fights\u201d Boruto has as a series compared to Part One Naruto is less a complaint that the fights aren\u2019t bloody or gore filled enough. It is that in comparison, Boruto\u2019s fights lack the substance that kept viewers of Naruto interested. Even Naruto and Sasuke vs Momoshiki did a meh job at this as such a large fight really only built and/or developed minimal character in Boruto. Development that is mostly ignored after that arc with a few mentions here in there. A \u201cbrutal fight\u201d more means a fight that has consequence and emotional meaning. \n\nI may have misunderstood your comment as your tone made it sound like you were trying to dismiss criticism of Boruto by claiming it was for kids, but that\u2019s more on me as I\u2019ve had many arguments with people over flaws in the Star Wars Sequels with them dismissing criticism as \u201cIt\u2019s a movie about space wizards meant for children\u201d. It isn\u2019t a real argument I am sick of hearing it. So I apologize if I misunderstood your tone.",

            "body": "I forced myself to watch it and it honestly wasn\u2019t as bad as everyone was saying it was. The first few arcs were boring af but I still continued because I wanted to see what had happened to all of the characters I\u2019d grown to love. Ngl, they did Kiba and Gaara dirty and I have cried over how Kiba looks like a greasy old guy who lives in a caravan but oh well I guess. The plot of Boruto has me tripping balls but it doesn\u2019t come *close* to the trauma that the Naruto characters had to go through. I remember Boruto and Shikadai freaking out over something and thinking to myself: \n\u2018The fuck? It\u2019s a spicy burger you didn\u2019t get to eat? What kind of problem is t h a t?\u2019\nThe shows character designs are awful and just upright stupid in Sadara\u2019s case. WHY GIVE A CHARACTER WITH THE SHARINGAN G L A S S E S? She\u2019s gonna get the mangakyo and be blind asf. \nBoruto is always bitching about one thing or another but when I comes to him being pissed with Naruto I can\u2019t blame him. They made Naruto hokage like he wanted too but in return d e s t r o y e d his relationships with his family. \n\nI think I\u2019ve done enough bitching for one day, so I\u2019ll talk about what I liked.\n\nOk got to be honest, Shikadai and Mitsuki are great characters and I have no reason for it. I just love their whole vibe. The classmates of Boruto are cool enough, but I hate Sadara with a passion, like I did with Sakura. Guess it runs in the family. I never would\u2019ve expected Shino to be a teacher but I love that he gets some screen time, I\u2019ve wanted it for a while. \nI know people get angry because of Boruto\u2019s animation style but I think both styles are lively in their own way. Naruto was rough, fitting the settings and plot, and Boruto is clean and shiny, like the new, modern Konoha (you could say shiny and smooth like Boruto\u2019s brain but he has had some breakthroughs before so I\u2019ll give him credit for that). \n\n\nIn conclusion:\n\nNaruto was definitely the alpha male compared to Boruto, and the plot overall was better and some character\u2019s backstories did make me cry. Boruto hasn\u2019t had anything that has made me miserable just yet, but hopefully it will come into clutch in the future. Boruto as it\u2019s own story would be better than it continuing Naruto\u2019s story, who had already achieved his \u2018main protagonist\u2019 dream. \n\nMy personal rating: 6/10 \n\nIt is so-so. One of those shows that probably shouldn\u2019t exist but does anyway. I get to see characters I already know time to time so I keep watching.\n\nI just realised I\u2019ve written a whole-ass essay and put more effort into it that any schoolwork I\u2019ve ever had to do before.",

Sure, general right-wing thought is becoming more prominent, but I see it more as a natural response to the rise of far left ideology in the past decade, even the center is considered \u201ctoo right wing\u201d to them.\n\nHonestly? The biggest problem we have in the West is our increasing inability and unwillingness to tolerate and live with people with whom we disagree with. There was a point in America where the Right, Left and Center could all co-exist peacefully thanks to the sharing of common principles and ideals, we were all Americans in the end. But with the current attack on our core institutions and the attempt to blatantly rewrite our history and culture, it is becoming an increasingly divided country at a fundamental level.\n\nAnd the solution is pretty simple in my opinion, everybody needs to put away their keyboards and cellphones and actually go out to interact with real humans, you don\u2019t understand who someone is as a person by reading their tweets, you understand them by talking to them in their day-to-day life, and you get to realize that even those people who appear to be fundamentally different to you probably have like 95% of the same values and morals as you.

You have a sizable chunk of the population in the US that politicized wearing a mask, some of which think the pandemic is a hoax. You have a report coming to light that Russia has been trying to intervene in UK politics. You even have people in Poland waving Nazi flags as the country slides further to the right. The irony, waving the flag of people that would have viewed Poles as subhuman Slavic scum deserving only death. It'd be like Granny Chiyo becoming a fan of White Fang.",

Now, if your neighbor suddenly decides to start pushing for systematic changes that specifically aim to diminish your rights as a Jew, then that\u2019s where the trouble happens and he\u2019s clearly in the wrong.\nBut what if that doesn\u2019t happen? What if his only real sin is that he\u2019s always talking about how much he hates Jews and he loves white supremacy? He\u2019s not calling for legislation to infringe upon your rights, he\u2019s just being an absolute racist cunt. Well, again you don\u2019t have to like him, and you are perfectly within your rights to hate him in return, but he\u2019s not actually being an existential threat to you. \nHowever, if YOU then started calling for legislation and systematic changes that prevented HIM from exercising his rights (in this case freedom of speech), then it would be you who is in the wrong in that scenario.\n\nYou don\u2019t fight fire with fire, you don\u2019t take an eye for an eye, that is not how a free society functions. We fight ignorance with reason and logic, we fight injustice with virtue and ethics, we fight our deepest ideological disagreements through civil discourse and conversation, we fight lies with truth. THAT is our civic duty as moral citizens, it\u2019s the only thing we have any control over. \n\nNeither you nor I can fix the US/China tensions, or the Coronavirus, or the world economy. The only thing we have any control over is the relationships we have with the people around us, and if you can become a person who can make the lives of those around you just slightly better, then that increases the probability tremendously of creating a positive feedback loop of success for yourself and your community at large. It\u2019s not karma, it\u2019s simply stats in the end.",

There is no room to tolerate people like Richard Spencer, for instance, a man than wants \"peaceful genocide\" of \"lessers.\" These men always act in bad faith, and claim freedom of speech, whilst infiltrating the political arena to further their goals. These people will kill if given the chance. All you have to do is look at the bomb plots that thankfully were stopped in the aftermath of George Floyd. Alt-reichers planned on setting off bombs at the protests to A) Kill protesters, and B) Shift blame towards BLM to delegitimize the movement. One plot in Oakland resulted in the death of a security guard. This now goes all the way to the White House, with the president retweeting a video where a Trump supporter in a golf cart very clearly yells, \"White Power\". Not to mention the official social media pages of the vice president posting 88 ads that begin with 14 words. They can feign ignorance all they want, but they know full well what 1488 means. Jesus man, you sound like the 1936 New York Times op-ed that said Jews in Germany were hurting their cause by protesting in Germany.",

To try to judge it and enjoy it while disregarding the prequel is possible, but in the end it is not the full experience as you would then have to sacrifice any and all knowledge of the prequel and the.

They seem to forget major lessons they learned, and what little they do learn seems to be at little or no consequence to them. In fact, most deaths that have happened in Boruto are more emotionally aimed at fans of Naruto than the characters of Boruto such as Onoki. The reason I bring this up as it is the contextualized version of the joke in this comment section. The \u201clack of brutal fights\u201d Boruto has as a series compared to Part One Naruto is less a complaint that the fights aren\u2019t bloody or gore filled enough. It is that in comparison, Boruto\u2019s fights lack the substance that kept viewers of Naruto interested. Even Naruto and Sasuke vs Momoshiki did a meh job at this as such a large fight really only built and/or developed minimal character in Boruto. Development that is mostly ignored after that arc with a few mentions here in there. A \u201cbrutal fight\u201d more means a fight that has consequence and emotional meaning. \n\nI may have misunderstood your comment as your tone made it sound like you were trying to dismiss criticism of Boruto by claiming it was for kids, but that\u2019s more on me as I\u2019ve had many arguments with people over flaws in the Star Wars Sequels with them dismissing criticism as \u201cIt\u2019s a movie about space wizards meant for children\u201d.

Sure, general right-wing thought is becoming more prominent, but I see it more as a natural response to the rise of far left ideology in the past decade, even the center is considered \u201ctoo right wing\u201d to them.\n\nHonestly? The biggest problem we have in the West is our increasing inability and unwillingness to tolerate and live with people with whom we disagree with. There was a point in America where the Right, Left and Center could all co-exist peacefully thanks to the sharing of common principles and ideals, we were all Americans in the end. But with the current attack on our core institutions and the attempt to blatantly rewrite our history and culture, it is becoming an increasingly divided country at a fundamental level.\n\nAnd the solution is pretty simple in my opinion, everybody needs to put away their keyboards and cellphones and actually go out to interact with real humans, you don\u2019t understand who someone is as a person by reading their tweets, you understand them by talking to them in their day-to-day life, and you get to realize that even those people who appear to be fundamentally different to you probably have like 95% of the same values and morals as you. I am a proud greedy Capitalist, and my best friend is a filthy Commie, people ARE capable of coexisting with one another even when they disagree, we are far more than our ideologies.",

People can coexist only if there isn't a desire to stamp out a segment of the population. There's much more going on that just people in the west disagreeing on the internet. You have a sizable chunk of the population in the US that politicized wearing a mask, some of which think the pandemic is a hoax. You have a report coming to light that Russia has been trying to intervene in UK politics. You even have people in Poland waving Nazi flags as the country slides further to the right. The irony, waving the flag of people that would have viewed Poles as subhuman Slavic scum deserving only death. It'd be like Granny Chiyo becoming a fan of White Fang.",

Now, if your neighbor suddenly decides to start pushing for systematic changes that specifically aim to diminish your rights as a Jew, then that\u2019s where the trouble happens and he\u2019s clearly in the wrong.\nBut what if that doesn\u2019t happen? What if his only real sin is that he\u2019s always talking about how much he hates Jews and he loves white supremacy? He\u2019s not calling for legislation to infringe upon your rights, he\u2019s just being an absolute racist cunt. Well, again you don\u2019t have to like him, and you are perfectly within your rights to hate him in return, but he\u2019s not actually being an existential threat to you. \nHowever, if YOU then started calling for legislation and systematic changes that prevented HIM from exercising his rights (in this case freedom of speech), then it would be you who is in the wrong in that scenario.\n\nYou don\u2019t fight fire with fire, you don\u2019t take an eye for an eye, that is not how a free society functions. We fight ignorance with reason and logic, we fight injustice with virtue and ethics, we fight our deepest ideological disagreements through civil discourse and conversation, we fight lies with truth. THAT is our civic duty as moral citizens, it\u2019s the only thing we have any control over. \n\nNeither you nor I can fix the US/China tensions, or the Coronavirus, or the world economy. The only thing we have any control over is the relationships we have with the people around us, and if you can become a person who can make the lives of those around you just slightly better, then that increases the probability tremendously of creating a positive feedback loop of success for yourself and your community at large. It\u2019s not karma, it\u2019s simply stats in the end.",

These people will kill if given the chance. All you have to do is look at the bomb plots that thankfully were stopped in the aftermath of George Floyd. Alt-reichers planned on setting off bombs at the protests to A) Kill protesters, and B) Shift blame towards BLM to delegitimize the movement. One plot in Oakland resulted in the death of a security guard. This now goes all the way to the White House, with the president retweeting a video where a Trump supporter in a golf cart very clearly yells, \"White Power\". Not to mention the official social media pages of the vice president posting 88 ads that begin with 14 words. They can feign ignorance all they want, but they know full well what 1488 means. Jesus man, you sound like the 1936 New York Times op-ed that said Jews in Germany were hurting their cause by protesting in Germany.",

They seem to forget major lessons they learned, and what little they do learn seems to be at little or no consequence to them. In fact, most deaths that have happened in Boruto are more emotionally aimed at fans of Naruto than the characters of Boruto such as Onoki. The reason I bring this up as it is the contextualized version of the joke in this comment section. The \u201clack of brutal fights\u201d Boruto has as a series compared to Part One Naruto is less a complaint that the fights aren\u2019t bloody or gore filled enough. It is that in comparison, Boruto\u2019s fights lack the substance that kept viewers of Naruto interested. Even Naruto and Sasuke vs Momoshiki did a meh job at this as such a large fight really only built and/or developed minimal character in Boruto. Development that is mostly ignored after that arc with a few mentions here in there. A \u201cbrutal fight\u201d more means a fight that has consequence and emotional meaning. \n\nI may have misunderstood your comment as your tone made it sound like you were trying to dismiss criticism of Boruto by claiming it was for kids, but that\u2019s more on me as I\u2019ve had many arguments with people over flaws in the Star Wars Sequels with them dismissing criticism as \u201cIt\u2019s a movie about space wizards meant for children\u201d.

I also did say he probably knows how to use the substitution jutsu, most likely from training at the academy, but I don\u2019t recall him ever actually using it. I never mentioned the summoning jutsu because the comment I replied to already mentioned it. The problem with the word jutsu is it means \u201ctechnique, method, skill, spell, or trick\u201d so by that logic anytime anyone does something that no ordinary person can do in Naruto it\u2019s a jutsu.",

Since he didn\u2019t take kurama (nine tails) on until shippuden I believe they were referring to Shukaku (one tail).

Sure, general right-wing thought is becoming more prominent, but I see it more as a natural response to the rise of far left ideology in the past decade, even the center is considered \u201ctoo right wing\u201d to them.\n\nHonestly? The biggest problem we have in the West is our increasing inability and unwillingness to tolerate and live with people with whom we disagree with. There was a point in America where the Right, Left and Center could all co-exist peacefully thanks to the sharing of common principles and ideals, we were all Americans in the end. But with the current attack on our core institutions and the attempt to blatantly rewrite our history and culture, it is becoming an increasingly divided country at a fundamental level.\n\nAnd the solution is pretty simple in my opinion, everybody needs to put away their keyboards and cellphones and actually go out to interact with real humans, you don\u2019t understand who someone is as a person by reading their tweets, you understand them by talking to them in their day-to-day life, and you get to realize that even those people who appear to be fundamentally different to you probably have like 95% of the same values and morals as you.

There's more and more border skirmishes between China and India, as well as with Pakistan over Kashmir like the last 70 years now. All 3 nations are nuclear powers. People can coexist only if there isn't a desire to stamp out a segment of the population. There's much more going on that just people in the west disagreeing on the internet.

Now, if your neighbor suddenly decides to start pushing for systematic changes that specifically aim to diminish your rights as a Jew, then that\u2019s where the trouble happens and he\u2019s clearly in the wrong.\nBut what if that doesn\u2019t happen? What if his only real sin is that he\u2019s always talking about how much he hates Jews and he loves white supremacy? He\u2019s not calling for legislation to infringe upon your rights, he\u2019s just being an absolute racist cunt. Well, again you don\u2019t have to like him, and you are perfectly within your rights to hate him in return, but he\u2019s not actually being an existential threat to you. \nHowever, if YOU then started calling for legislation and systematic changes that prevented HIM from exercising his rights (in this case freedom of speech), then it would be you who is in the wrong in that scenario.\n\nYou don\u2019t fight fire with fire, you don\u2019t take an eye for an eye, that is not how a free society functions.

THAT is our civic duty as moral citizens, it\u2019s the only thing we have any control over. \n\nNeither you nor I can fix the US/China tensions, or the Coronavirus, or the world economy. The only thing we have any control over is the relationships we have with the people around us, and if you can become a person who can make the lives of those around you just slightly better, then that increases the probability tremendously of creating a positive feedback loop of success for yourself and your community at large. It\u2019s not karma, it\u2019s simply stats in the end.",

There is no room to tolerate people like Richard Spencer, for instance, a man than wants \"peaceful genocide\" of \"lessers.\" These men always act in bad faith, and claim freedom of speech, whilst infiltrating the political arena to further their goals. These people will kill if given the chance. All you have to do is look at the bomb plots that thankfully were stopped in the aftermath of George Floyd. Alt-reichers planned on setting off bombs at the protests to A) Kill protesters, and B) Shift blame towards BLM to delegitimize the movement. One plot in Oakland resulted in the death of a security guard. This now goes all the way to the White House, with the president retweeting a video where a Trump supporter in a golf cart very clearly yells, \"White Power\". Not to mention the official social media pages of the vice president posting 88 ads that begin with 14 words. They can feign ignorance all they want, but they know full well what 1488 means. Jesus man, you sound like the 1936 New York Times op-ed that said Jews in Germany were hurting their cause by protesting in Germany.",

They seem to forget major lessons they learned, and what little they do learn seems to be at little or no consequence to them. In fact, most deaths that have happened in Boruto are more emotionally aimed at fans of Naruto than the characters of Boruto such as Onoki. The reason I bring this up as it is the contextualized version of the joke in this comment section. The \u201clack of brutal fights\u201d Boruto has as a series compared to Part One Naruto is less a complaint that the fights aren\u2019t bloody or gore filled enough. It is that in comparison, Boruto\u2019s fights lack the substance that kept viewers of Naruto interested. Even Naruto and Sasuke vs Momoshiki did a meh job at this as such a large fight really only built and/or developed minimal character in Boruto. Development that is mostly ignored after that arc with a few mentions here in there. A \u201cbrutal fight\u201d more means a fight that has consequence and emotional meaning. \n\nI may have misunderstood your comment as your tone made it sound like you were trying to dismiss criticism of Boruto by claiming it was for kids, but that\u2019s more on me as I\u2019ve had many arguments with people over flaws in the Star Wars Sequels with them dismissing criticism as \u201cIt\u2019s a movie about space wizards meant for children\u201d. It isn\u2019t a real argument I am sick of hearing it. So I apologize if I misunderstood your tone.",

Sure, general right-wing thought is becoming more prominent, but I see it more as a natural response to the rise of far left ideology in the past decade, even the center is considered \u201ctoo right wing\u201d to them.\n\nHonestly? The biggest problem we have in the West is our increasing inability and unwillingness to tolerate and live with people with whom we disagree with. There was a point in America where the Right, Left and Center could all co-exist peacefully thanks to the sharing of common principles and ideals, we were all Americans in the end. But with the current attack on our core institutions and the attempt to blatantly rewrite our history and culture, it is becoming an increasingly divided country at a fundamental level.\n\nAnd the solution is pretty simple in my opinion, everybody needs to put away their keyboards and cellphones and actually go out to interact with real humans, you don\u2019t understand who someone is as a person by reading their tweets, you understand them by talking to them in their day-to-day life, and you get to realize that even those people who appear to be fundamentally different to you probably have like 95% of the same values and morals as you. I am a proud greedy Capitalist, and my best friend is a filthy Commie, people ARE capable of coexisting with one another even when they disagree, we are far more than our ideologies.",

Modi and his ilk, for example, want to create a Hindu ethnostate, and they are well underway with undermining the citizenship status of Muslims, and have been building mass detention camps. There's more and more border skirmishes between China and India, as well as with Pakistan over Kashmir like the last 70 years now. All 3 nations are nuclear powers. People can coexist only if there isn't a desire to stamp out a segment of the population. There's much more going on that just people in the west disagreeing on the internet. You have a sizable chunk of the population in the US that politicized wearing a mask, some of which think the pandemic is a hoax. You have a report coming to light that Russia has been trying to intervene in UK politics. You even have people in Poland waving Nazi flags as the country slides further to the right. The irony, waving the flag of people that would have viewed Poles as subhuman Slavic scum deserving only death. It'd be like Granny Chiyo becoming a fan of White Fang.",

Now, if your neighbor suddenly decides to start pushing for systematic changes that specifically aim to diminish your rights as a Jew, then that\u2019s where the trouble happens and he\u2019s clearly in the wrong.\nBut what if that doesn\u2019t happen? What if his only real sin is that he\u2019s always talking about how much he hates Jews and he loves white supremacy? He\u2019s not calling for legislation to infringe upon your rights, he\u2019s just being an absolute racist cunt. Well, again you don\u2019t have to like him, and you are perfectly within your rights to hate him in return, but he\u2019s not actually being an existential threat to you. \nHowever, if YOU then started calling for legislation and systematic changes that prevented HIM from exercising his rights (in this case freedom of speech), then it would be you who is in the wrong in that scenario.\n\nYou don\u2019t fight fire with fire, you don\u2019t take an eye for an eye, that is not how a free society functions. We fight ignorance with reason and logic, we fight injustice with virtue and ethics, we fight our deepest ideological disagreements through civil discourse and conversation, we fight lies with truth. THAT is our civic duty as moral citizens, it\u2019s the only thing we have any control over. \n\nNeither you nor I can fix the US/China tensions, or the Coronavirus, or the world economy. The only thing we have any control over is the relationships we have with the people around us, and if you can become a person who can make the lives of those around you just slightly better, then that increases the probability tremendously of creating a positive feedback loop of success for yourself and your community at large. It\u2019s not karma, it\u2019s simply stats in the end.",

There is no room to tolerate people like Richard Spencer, for instance, a man than wants \"peaceful genocide\" of \"lessers.\" These men always act in bad faith, and claim freedom of speech, whilst infiltrating the political arena to further their goals.

Alt-reichers planned on setting off bombs at the protests to A) Kill protesters, and B) Shift blame towards BLM to delegitimize the movement. One plot in Oakland resulted in the death of a security guard. This now goes all the way to the White House, with the president retweeting a video where a Trump supporter in a golf cart very clearly yells, \"White Power\". Not to mention the official social media pages of the vice president posting 88 ads that begin with 14 words. They can feign ignorance all they want, but they know full well what 1488 means. Jesus man, you sound like the 1936 New York Times op-ed that said Jews in Germany were hurting their cause by protesting in Germany.",

Sure, general right-wing thought is becoming more prominent, but I see it more as a natural response to the rise of far left ideology in the past decade, even the center is considered \u201ctoo right wing\u201d to them.\n\nHonestly? The biggest problem we have in the West is our increasing inability and unwillingness to tolerate and live with people with whom we disagree with. There was a point in America where the Right, Left and Center could all co-exist peacefully thanks to the sharing of common principles and ideals, we were all Americans in the end. But with the current attack on our core institutions and the attempt to blatantly rewrite our history and culture, it is becoming an increasingly divided country at a fundamental level.\n\nAnd the solution is pretty simple in my opinion, everybody needs to put away their keyboards and cellphones and actually go out to interact with real humans, you don\u2019t understand who someone is as a person by reading their tweets, you understand them by talking to them in their day-to-day life, and you get to realize that even those people who appear to be fundamentally different to you probably have like 95% of the same values and morals as you. I am a proud greedy Capitalist, and my best friend is a filthy Commie, people ARE capable of coexisting with one another even when they disagree, we are far more than our ideologies.",

There's more and more border skirmishes between China and India, as well as with Pakistan over Kashmir like the last 70 years now. All 3 nations are nuclear powers. People can coexist only if there isn't a desire to stamp out a segment of the population. There's much more going on that just people in the west disagreeing on the internet. You have a sizable chunk of the population in the US that politicized wearing a mask, some of which think the pandemic is a hoax. You have a report coming to light that Russia has been trying to intervene in UK politics. You even have people in Poland waving Nazi flags as the country slides further to the right. The irony, waving the flag of people that would have viewed Poles as subhuman Slavic scum deserving only death. It'd be like Granny Chiyo becoming a fan of White Fang.",

Now, if your neighbor suddenly decides to start pushing for systematic changes that specifically aim to diminish your rights as a Jew, then that\u2019s where the trouble happens and he\u2019s clearly in the wrong.\nBut what if that doesn\u2019t happen? What if his only real sin is that he\u2019s always talking about how much he hates Jews and he loves white supremacy? He\u2019s not calling for legislation to infringe upon your rights, he\u2019s just being an absolute racist cunt. Well, again you don\u2019t have to like him, and you are perfectly within your rights to hate him in return, but he\u2019s not actually being an existential threat to you. \nHowever, if YOU then started calling for legislation and systematic changes that prevented HIM from exercising his rights (in this case freedom of speech), then it would be you who is in the wrong in that scenario.\n\nYou don\u2019t fight fire with fire, you don\u2019t take an eye for an eye, that is not how a free society functions. We fight ignorance with reason and logic, we fight injustice with virtue and ethics, we fight our deepest ideological disagreements through civil discourse and conversation, we fight lies with truth. THAT is our civic duty as moral citizens, it\u2019s the only thing we have any control over. \n\nNeither you nor I can fix the US/China tensions, or the Coronavirus, or the world economy. The only thing we have any control over is the relationships we have with the people around us, and if you can become a person who can make the lives of those around you just slightly better, then that increases the probability tremendously of creating a positive feedback loop of success for yourself and your community at large.

Alt-reichers planned on setting off bombs at the protests to A) Kill protesters, and B) Shift blame towards BLM to delegitimize the movement. One plot in Oakland resulted in the death of a security guard. This now goes all the way to the White House, with the president retweeting a video where a Trump supporter in a golf cart very clearly yells, \"White Power\". Not to mention the official social media pages of the vice president posting 88 ads that begin with 14 words. They can feign ignorance all they want, but they know full well what 1488 means.

There's more and more border skirmishes between China and India, as well as with Pakistan over Kashmir like the last 70 years now. All 3 nations are nuclear powers. People can coexist only if there isn't a desire to stamp out a segment of the population. There's much more going on that just people in the west disagreeing on the internet. You have a sizable chunk of the population in the US that politicized wearing a mask, some of which think the pandemic is a hoax. You have a report coming to light that Russia has been trying to intervene in UK politics. You even have people in Poland waving Nazi flags as the country slides further to the right. The irony, waving the flag of people that would have viewed Poles as subhuman Slavic scum deserving only death. It'd be like Granny Chiyo becoming a fan of White Fang.",

Now, if your neighbor suddenly decides to start pushing for systematic changes that specifically aim to diminish your rights as a Jew, then that\u2019s where the trouble happens and he\u2019s clearly in the wrong.\nBut what if that doesn\u2019t happen? What if his only real sin is that he\u2019s always talking about how much he hates Jews and he loves white supremacy? He\u2019s not calling for legislation to infringe upon your rights, he\u2019s just being an absolute racist cunt. Well, again you don\u2019t have to like him, and you are perfectly within your rights to hate him in return, but he\u2019s not actually being an existential threat to you. \nHowever, if YOU then started calling for legislation and systematic changes that prevented HIM from exercising his rights (in this case freedom of speech), then it would be you who is in the wrong in that scenario.\n\nYou don\u2019t fight fire with fire, you don\u2019t take an eye for an eye, that is not how a free society functions. We fight ignorance with reason and logic, we fight injustice with virtue and ethics, we fight our deepest ideological disagreements through civil discourse and conversation, we fight lies with truth. THAT is our civic duty as moral citizens, it\u2019s the only thing we have any control over. \n\nNeither you nor I can fix the US/China tensions, or the Coronavirus, or the world economy. The only thing we have any control over is the relationships we have with the people around us, and if you can become a person who can make the lives of those around you just slightly better, then that increases the probability tremendously of creating a positive feedback loop of success for yourself and your community at large. It\u2019s not karma, it\u2019s simply stats in the end.",

Alt-reichers planned on setting off bombs at the protests to A) Kill protesters, and B) Shift blame towards BLM to delegitimize the movement. One plot in Oakland resulted in the death of a security guard. This now goes all the way to the White House, with the president retweeting a video where a Trump supporter in a golf cart very clearly yells, \"White Power\". Not to mention the official social media pages of the vice president posting 88 ads that begin with 14 words. They can feign ignorance all they want, but they know full well what 1488 means.

Now, if your neighbor suddenly decides to start pushing for systematic changes that specifically aim to diminish your rights as a Jew, then that\u2019s where the trouble happens and he\u2019s clearly in the wrong.\nBut what if that doesn\u2019t happen? What if his only real sin is that he\u2019s always talking about how much he hates Jews and he loves white supremacy? He\u2019s not calling for legislation to infringe upon your rights, he\u2019s just being an absolute racist cunt. Well, again you don\u2019t have to like him, and you are perfectly within your rights to hate him in return, but he\u2019s not actually being an existential threat to you. \nHowever, if YOU then started calling for legislation and systematic changes that prevented HIM from exercising his rights (in this case freedom of speech), then it would be you who is in the wrong in that scenario.\n\nYou don\u2019t fight fire with fire, you don\u2019t take an eye for an eye, that is not how a free society functions. We fight ignorance with reason and logic, we fight injustice with virtue and ethics, we fight our deepest ideological disagreements through civil discourse and conversation, we fight lies with truth. THAT is our civic duty as moral citizens, it\u2019s the only thing we have any control over. \n\nNeither you nor I can fix the US/China tensions, or the Coronavirus, or the world economy. The only thing we have any control over is the relationships we have with the people around us, and if you can become a person who can make the lives of those around you just slightly better, then that increases the probability tremendously of creating a positive feedback loop of success for yourself and your community at large. It\u2019s not karma, it\u2019s simply stats in the end.",

Jesus man, you sound like the 1936 New York Times op-ed that said Jews in Germany were hurting their cause by protesting in Germany.",
