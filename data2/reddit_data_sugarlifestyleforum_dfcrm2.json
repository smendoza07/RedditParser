    "body": "We got along well at the M&G and he did everything right. He was respectful to the wait staff. He discussed payments. He didn't waste my time. He kept it professional. He was cute and had a great sense of humor. Basically he was unlike all the other men I had met.\n\nTonight we met at a local sports bar (he gave the option of a fancy place but this was way more my style). We ate wings and nachos, drank beer, made stupid and dark jokes, dropped the f bomb, laughed a ton, and made out outside. Went back to his place. Groped each other in the kitchen for a while and went back to his bedroom. He was not pushy. He was polite and asked about my boundaries. Generally I'm a little shy when it comes to eye contact during blowjobs but he loved it so much that I gave zero fucks. Nothing makes me happier and more turned on than looking up and seeing the flushed cheeks of a man receiving an excellent blowie while he tells me how hot I am. He looooooved it. Eventually we went outside, talked, said our goodbyes, and I went home. \n\nHe's a keeper. \u2665\ufe0f",
