    "body": "I\u2019m new to the bowl, a little more than 3 months.  First POT SB was a disaster.  We had M&G that went ok, then intimate date after agreeing to a monthly allowance.   She then began pestering for gift after gift, more than 2x allowance.  I quickly moved on.  \n\nStruck gold with 2nd.  We didn\u2019t do M&G cuz CoVid.  First date at my place for full PPM (intimate) or half PPM (platonic), her choice.  She chose intimate and we had a great time.  Second date was planned for intimacy but we talked and talked and ran out of time for intimacy before the driver showed up to take her home.\n\nSince then we\u2019ve been seeing each other 2x week, dates lasting 24-36 hours.  Sometime her little one comes, sometimes he doesn\u2019t.  Every date is a sleepover and we talk or text every day.  She is more SGF than SB, and doesn\u2019t like talking about allowance.  I\u2019ve leased her an apartment and now she\u2019ll be 5 minutes away instead of 45 and we\u2019re having a blast picking out furniture.  Between apartment and spending money, I give her 10x PPM and it\u2019s the best money I\u2019ve ever spent.  \n\nFor me, sugaring was a way to develop real intimacy quickly, not just sex but emotionally. I am 60 SD and she is 27 SB and age is a complete non-issue. We feel like we were made for each other.  It\u2019s been wonderful!",

That is actually quite alarming to me.\n\nThe apartment thing is neither here nor there; it\u2019s a personal decision I\u2019d advise against so soon, but it\u2019s your choice to make. The fact that you already know and have presumably bonded with her child, however, is something I\u2019m having a hard time with. I truly hope it lasts, for the sake of the kid.",

If this ends any time soon, will he still pay the rent until she can do it herself? That is also a child\u2019s home now and he made himself responsible for it. He put her in a position where she\u2019s entirely reliant on him, and so is her kid. I just really hope things continue going well.",

I would never \u201cpester\u201d my SD for gifts, I would just ask... and if I did, I would hope he would want to give to me.  I would hope that it would make him happy to know that his gift made me happy.  I\u2019ve been involved in several different arrangements, and the ones that were the happiest were the ones in which he was the most generous and I was the most appreciative.  I\u2019ve only had one SD who begrudged me what I wanted, but I later found out he had a personality disorder with narcissistic tendencies, and he had pretty deep emotional wounds of his own.\nMost men who truly care about a woman are happy to find ways to make her happy... remember,  one of the five Love Languages is \u201cReceiving Gifts\u201c, and it is a very valid way of feeling loved, valued, and cared for... and for some women like me, it\u2019s our number one love language... so just because you have to spend some extra money to make a woman happy doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s trying to take advantage of you. It could mean she just wants to feel loved by you. Trust me, most women who get into arrangements have daddy issues of some sort, and this is one way for you to help her heal them. But if you behave the way her father did, by refusing to show her love in a way that she recognizes, you\u2019re not helping her... you\u2019re actually hurting her, albeit unknowingly.  Oftentimes, when it looks like a SB seems to be asking a lot of you, it\u2019s really because she wants tangible proof that you care about her.  It\u2019s all very emotionally based... and many of us are not even conscious of these issues because they began in our childhood, but affect us into our adulthood.  \nThen again, if a SD is hesitant to buy his SB a gift that would easily make her happy just because he is afraid of being taken advantage of, that could indicate that he has some issues of his own that he needs to address.  The dynamic of older SD, younger SB can be a place to heal wounds... or re-open them. \n\nAnd yes, all of this is the therapist in me talking... sometimes I just can\u2019t help myself. But I hope it helps us all understand this type of situation a little better.",

True, we could argue the honesty of the feelings or the wisdom of how quickly the relationship developed, but she's become a true courtesan or \"sugar baby in modern times\".  \n\nIf any warnings were to be given, it should be to her for becoming so dependent on her SD so quickly.  Now she could find herself \"enslaved\" or a better word, \"locked in\" to her current SD.  Think about it, could she realistically expect to host other SD's at her apartment since its paid for by her current SD?\n\nWhile there are some potential red flags, that's true of any relationship.  I say, let him have his fun, let the relationship run its course, they're both enjoying themselves and getting what they need and want out of the sugar relationship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI say more power to them. :)",

I would never \u201cpester\u201d my SD for gifts, I would just ask... and if I did, I would hope he would want to give to me.  I would hope that it would make him happy to know that his gift made me happy.  I\u2019ve been involved in several different arrangements, and the ones that were the happiest were the ones in which he was the most generous and I was the most appreciative.  I\u2019ve only had one SD who begrudged me what I wanted, but I later found out he had a personality disorder with narcissistic tendencies, and he had pretty deep emotional wounds of his own.\nMost men who truly care about a woman are happy to find ways to make her happy... remember,  one of the five Love Languages is \u201cReceiving Gifts\u201c, and it is a very valid way of feeling loved, valued, and cared for... and for some women like me, it\u2019s our number one love language... so just because you have to spend some extra money to make a woman happy doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s trying to take advantage of you. It could mean she just wants to feel loved by you. Trust me, most women who get into arrangements have daddy issues of some sort, and this is one way for you to help her heal them. But if you behave the way her father did, by refusing to show her love in a way that she recognizes, you\u2019re not helping her... you\u2019re actually hurting her, albeit unknowingly.  Oftentimes, when it looks like a SB seems to be asking a lot of you, it\u2019s really because she wants tangible proof that you care about her.  It\u2019s all very emotionally based... and many of us are not even conscious of these issues because they began in our childhood, but affect us into our adulthood.  \nThen again, if a SD is hesitant to buy his SB a gift that would easily make her happy just because he is afraid of being taken advantage of, that could indicate that he has some issues of his own that he needs to address.  The dynamic of older SD, younger SB can be a place to heal wounds... or re-open them. \n\nAnd yes, all of this is the therapist in me talking... sometimes I just can\u2019t help myself. But I hope it helps us all understand this type of situation a little better.",

True, we could argue the honesty of the feelings or the wisdom of how quickly the relationship developed, but she's become a true courtesan or \"sugar baby in modern times\".  \n\nIf any warnings were to be given, it should be to her for becoming so dependent on her SD so quickly.  Now she could find herself \"enslaved\" or a better word, \"locked in\" to her current SD.  Think about it, could she realistically expect to host other SD's at her apartment since its paid for by her current SD?\n\nWhile there are some potential red flags, that's true of any relationship.  I say, let him have his fun, let the relationship run its course, they're both enjoying themselves and getting what they need and want out of the sugar relationship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI say more power to them. :)",

I would never \u201cpester\u201d my SD for gifts, I would just ask... and if I did, I would hope he would want to give to me.  I would hope that it would make him happy to know that his gift made me happy.  I\u2019ve been involved in several different arrangements, and the ones that were the happiest were the ones in which he was the most generous and I was the most appreciative.  I\u2019ve only had one SD who begrudged me what I wanted, but I later found out he had a personality disorder with narcissistic tendencies, and he had pretty deep emotional wounds of his own.\nMost men who truly care about a woman are happy to find ways to make her happy... remember,  one of the five Love Languages is \u201cReceiving Gifts\u201c, and it is a very valid way of feeling loved, valued, and cared for... and for some women like me, it\u2019s our number one love language... so just because you have to spend some extra money to make a woman happy doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s trying to take advantage of you. It could mean she just wants to feel loved by you. Trust me, most women who get into arrangements have daddy issues of some sort, and this is one way for you to help her heal them. But if you behave the way her father did, by refusing to show her love in a way that she recognizes, you\u2019re not helping her... you\u2019re actually hurting her, albeit unknowingly.  Oftentimes, when it looks like a SB seems to be asking a lot of you, it\u2019s really because she wants tangible proof that you care about her.  It\u2019s all very emotionally based... and many of us are not even conscious of these issues because they began in our childhood, but affect us into our adulthood.  \nThen again, if a SD is hesitant to buy his SB a gift that would easily make her happy just because he is afraid of being taken advantage of, that could indicate that he has some issues of his own that he needs to address.  The dynamic of older SD, younger SB can be a place to heal wounds... or re-open them. \n\nAnd yes, all of this is the therapist in me talking... sometimes I just can\u2019t help myself. But I hope it helps us all understand this type of situation a little better.",
