The dude subdued Kurama while fighting Madara, and *beat Madara at the same time*. He also subdued the seven other tailed beasts and distributed them (Suna/Sand already had Shukaku). He was the most powerful shinobi of his time, and I doubt anyone outside of Kaguya, Hagoromo, and maybe Indra and Asura had ever been more powerful. Even then, only Hagoromo was remembered as a legend that people weren't sure had even existed.\n\nHiruzen didn't have the raw power that Hashirama did to my knowledge (which honestly doesn't say much), but he was incredibly gifted in regard to ninjutsus and still extremely powerful. When Hiruzen became Hokage, Tobirama and Hashirama were dead, and I doubt anyone else alive had anywhere near the raw power that they had, which I imagine kinda left the door open for Hiruzen. He had been trained by them, so he was already incredibly strong at a young age. I imagine he was considered a very formidable opponent even amongst older shinobi, and was probably an absolute monster in comparison to most his age. At some point in time, he apparently learned and could use all the jutsu Konoha/Leaf had to offer (probably just knowledge of bloodline techniques since you physically can't learn those outside of that specific family), which earned him the title \"The Professor\". If I recall correctly, the guy was considered a genius in every aspect of being a shinobi (clearly this didn't extend to basic childcare and most shit Danzo was even remotely involved with, including Orochimaru). I imagine his knowledge combined with his strength left him with few people that could hope to challenge him.",

The dude subdued Kurama while fighting Madara, and *beat Madara at the same time*. He also subdued the seven other tailed beasts and distributed them (Suna/Sand already had Shukaku). He was the most powerful shinobi of his time, and I doubt anyone outside of Kaguya, Hagoromo, and maybe Indra and Asura had ever been more powerful. Even then, only Hagoromo was remembered as a legend that people weren't sure had even existed.\n\nHiruzen didn't have the raw power that Hashirama did to my knowledge (which honestly doesn't say much), but he was incredibly gifted in regard to ninjutsus and still extremely powerful. When Hiruzen became Hokage, Tobirama and Hashirama were dead, and I doubt anyone else alive had anywhere near the raw power that they had, which I imagine kinda left the door open for Hiruzen. He had been trained by them, so he was already incredibly strong at a young age. I imagine he was considered a very formidable opponent even amongst older shinobi, and was probably an absolute monster in comparison to most his age. At some point in time, he apparently learned and could use all the jutsu Konoha/Leaf had to offer (probably just knowledge of bloodline techniques since you physically can't learn those outside of that specific family), which earned him the title \"The Professor\". If I recall correctly, the guy was considered a genius in every aspect of being a shinobi (clearly this didn't extend to basic childcare and most shit Danzo was even remotely involved with, including Orochimaru). I imagine his knowledge combined with his strength left him with few people that could hope to challenge him.",

The dude subdued Kurama while fighting Madara, and *beat Madara at the same time*. He also subdued the seven other tailed beasts and distributed them (Suna/Sand already had Shukaku). He was the most powerful shinobi of his time, and I doubt anyone outside of Kaguya, Hagoromo, and maybe Indra and Asura had ever been more powerful. Even then, only Hagoromo was remembered as a legend that people weren't sure had even existed.\n\nHiruzen didn't have the raw power that Hashirama did to my knowledge (which honestly doesn't say much), but he was incredibly gifted in regard to ninjutsus and still extremely powerful. When Hiruzen became Hokage, Tobirama and Hashirama were dead, and I doubt anyone else alive had anywhere near the raw power that they had, which I imagine kinda left the door open for Hiruzen. He had been trained by them, so he was already incredibly strong at a young age. I imagine he was considered a very formidable opponent even amongst older shinobi, and was probably an absolute monster in comparison to most his age. At some point in time, he apparently learned and could use all the jutsu Konoha/Leaf had to offer (probably just knowledge of bloodline techniques since you physically can't learn those outside of that specific family), which earned him the title \"The Professor\". If I recall correctly, the guy was considered a genius in every aspect of being a shinobi (clearly this didn't extend to basic childcare and most shit Danzo was even remotely involved with, including Orochimaru). I imagine his knowledge combined with his strength left him with few people that could hope to challenge him.",

The dude subdued Kurama while fighting Madara, and *beat Madara at the same time*. He also subdued the seven other tailed beasts and distributed them (Suna/Sand already had Shukaku). He was the most powerful shinobi of his time, and I doubt anyone outside of Kaguya, Hagoromo, and maybe Indra and Asura had ever been more powerful. Even then, only Hagoromo was remembered as a legend that people weren't sure had even existed.\n\nHiruzen didn't have the raw power that Hashirama did to my knowledge (which honestly doesn't say much), but he was incredibly gifted in regard to ninjutsus and still extremely powerful. When Hiruzen became Hokage, Tobirama and Hashirama were dead, and I doubt anyone else alive had anywhere near the raw power that they had, which I imagine kinda left the door open for Hiruzen. He had been trained by them, so he was already incredibly strong at a young age. I imagine he was considered a very formidable opponent even amongst older shinobi, and was probably an absolute monster in comparison to most his age. At some point in time, he apparently learned and could use all the jutsu Konoha/Leaf had to offer (probably just knowledge of bloodline techniques since you physically can't learn those outside of that specific family), which earned him the title \"The Professor\". If I recall correctly, the guy was considered a genius in every aspect of being a shinobi (clearly this didn't extend to basic childcare and most shit Danzo was even remotely involved with, including Orochimaru). I imagine his knowledge combined with his strength left him with few people that could hope to challenge him.",

The dude subdued Kurama while fighting Madara, and *beat Madara at the same time*. He also subdued the seven other tailed beasts and distributed them (Suna/Sand already had Shukaku). He was the most powerful shinobi of his time, and I doubt anyone outside of Kaguya, Hagoromo, and maybe Indra and Asura had ever been more powerful. Even then, only Hagoromo was remembered as a legend that people weren't sure had even existed.\n\nHiruzen didn't have the raw power that Hashirama did to my knowledge (which honestly doesn't say much), but he was incredibly gifted in regard to ninjutsus and still extremely powerful. When Hiruzen became Hokage, Tobirama and Hashirama were dead, and I doubt anyone else alive had anywhere near the raw power that they had, which I imagine kinda left the door open for Hiruzen. He had been trained by them, so he was already incredibly strong at a young age. I imagine he was considered a very formidable opponent even amongst older shinobi, and was probably an absolute monster in comparison to most his age. At some point in time, he apparently learned and could use all the jutsu Konoha/Leaf had to offer (probably just knowledge of bloodline techniques since you physically can't learn those outside of that specific family), which earned him the title \"The Professor\". If I recall correctly, the guy was considered a genius in every aspect of being a shinobi (clearly this didn't extend to basic childcare and most shit Danzo was even remotely involved with, including Orochimaru). I imagine his knowledge combined with his strength left him with few people that could hope to challenge him.",

The dude subdued Kurama while fighting Madara, and *beat Madara at the same time*. He also subdued the seven other tailed beasts and distributed them (Suna/Sand already had Shukaku). He was the most powerful shinobi of his time, and I doubt anyone outside of Kaguya, Hagoromo, and maybe Indra and Asura had ever been more powerful. Even then, only Hagoromo was remembered as a legend that people weren't sure had even existed.\n\nHiruzen didn't have the raw power that Hashirama did to my knowledge (which honestly doesn't say much), but he was incredibly gifted in regard to ninjutsus and still extremely powerful. When Hiruzen became Hokage, Tobirama and Hashirama were dead, and I doubt anyone else alive had anywhere near the raw power that they had, which I imagine kinda left the door open for Hiruzen. He had been trained by them, so he was already incredibly strong at a young age. I imagine he was considered a very formidable opponent even amongst older shinobi, and was probably an absolute monster in comparison to most his age. At some point in time, he apparently learned and could use all the jutsu Konoha/Leaf had to offer (probably just knowledge of bloodline techniques since you physically can't learn those outside of that specific family), which earned him the title \"The Professor\". If I recall correctly, the guy was considered a genius in every aspect of being a shinobi (clearly this didn't extend to basic childcare and most shit Danzo was even remotely involved with, including Orochimaru). I imagine his knowledge combined with his strength left him with few people that could hope to challenge him.",

The dude subdued Kurama while fighting Madara, and *beat Madara at the same time*. He also subdued the seven other tailed beasts and distributed them (Suna/Sand already had Shukaku). He was the most powerful shinobi of his time, and I doubt anyone outside of Kaguya, Hagoromo, and maybe Indra and Asura had ever been more powerful. Even then, only Hagoromo was remembered as a legend that people weren't sure had even existed.\n\nHiruzen didn't have the raw power that Hashirama did to my knowledge (which honestly doesn't say much), but he was incredibly gifted in regard to ninjutsus and still extremely powerful. When Hiruzen became Hokage, Tobirama and Hashirama were dead, and I doubt anyone else alive had anywhere near the raw power that they had, which I imagine kinda left the door open for Hiruzen. He had been trained by them, so he was already incredibly strong at a young age. I imagine he was considered a very formidable opponent even amongst older shinobi, and was probably an absolute monster in comparison to most his age. At some point in time, he apparently learned and could use all the jutsu Konoha/Leaf had to offer (probably just knowledge of bloodline techniques since you physically can't learn those outside of that specific family), which earned him the title \"The Professor\". If I recall correctly, the guy was considered a genius in every aspect of being a shinobi (clearly this didn't extend to basic childcare and most shit Danzo was even remotely involved with, including Orochimaru). I imagine his knowledge combined with his strength left him with few people that could hope to challenge him.",
