    "body": "I've been with my SD since Sept/Oct but we've only seen each other about 4-5 times since our arrangement started. We agreed on a certain amount per month, split into a smaller amount per week, which would be given to me whenever we met up. But obviously, we didn't meet up every week and I didn't get my allowance every week. Back in October, he asked for my cashapp and I assumed it was because he was going to switch to transferring me the allowance instead of giving it to me in cash, but when we got together the next few times I was still given cash so I forgot all about cashapp.\n\nWell today, I opened cashapp for the first time in months and I see a large sum of money as my balance. Apparently my SD has been sending me allowance the weeks we haven't met up and my dumbass never noticed. Now I feel awful because I've never thanked him the times he's sent me money and he probably thinks I'm ungrateful. I want to text him to thank him for everything but I know he doesn't really like acknowledging the money part of the arrangement. All I know is I need to do SOMETHING nice for this amazing man, I just don't know what.\n\nUpdate: I texted him basically saying what y'all suggested and I'm still waiting for his response. I'm thinking of getting him some thc oil, a nice bottle of wine, and a card with a cute note, too.",
