You know the fancy bushes they trim into shapes? Anyways I think it\u2019s time for payback ....\n\nI think we should all band together and call (an option) his wife and squeeze happiness out of his life.  You know \"SBs strong together\" as they say!\n\nTime to get our own diamond hands ladies.  \n\n\nPS: This is a satire.",

However, one possible way out for the hedge funds is to call up the GME execs asap, convince them to issue new shares at some price,say $20/share in a private offering. GME profits by getting a bunch of money, the hedge funds buy up all the new shares to close their short positions, and the small guys get screwed by holding on to diluted shares. Anyone know if this strategy could work? I'm sure the hedgies are considering it if so.",
