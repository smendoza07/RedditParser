    "body": "I always saw all the warnings here that you shouldn't work for your SD, but I thought I wouldn't fall into the trap. Well, here I am. I knew my SD for about a year before I become his personal assistant, and it worked great. The first few months of me working for him were great, flexible hours, good pay, a fun environment. It was good. \n\nBut being around him all the time started to take a toll on me. We don't have an employee-boss relationship, it started to become a very 1 sided friendship of which he has become more and more reliant on me. It started with calling me multiple times a day, on my days off, to complain and use me as his personal therapist. Then when I said I wanted things to be a bit more professional when I wasn't working, he got mad. Accused me of not caring about him, of not being a good friend, not being there for him when he needed it. \n\nI'm a 19 year old girl. He's a 59 year old man. It is not my job to be his personal therapist, his closest friend, or even anything more than an employee with some benefits. That's how I hoped this would work out. Its gotten to the point where I can't handle it anymore. He's become an emotional black hole in my life. I'm doing well mentally for the first time ever, and he seems to resent that. I swear if I have one more 1am call about him whining that he's sad because of some stupid ass reason only an extremely wealthy semi-retired person could come up with, I'm going to lose it. \n\nI want to quit, but there's no where else hiring at the moment at the wage I am getting, and I need to use him as a reference so we can't end on bad terms. \n\nSo take this as a warning, please sugar babies, don't work for your SD. It may seem great and elusive with all the travel and benefits that come along with it, but the dynamic is destined to fail. Its not worth it. Because suddenly you'll find yourself in a position where your job may be in jeopardy, or you want to quit, but there's no out, and it really really fucking sucks.",

If the answer to that is yes then you have a relationship issue that may be solvable ,  if no then you have a relationship issue AND an economic issue which is probably unsolvable.  Beyond that is the usual question ,  is this relationship good for your soul and something you will look back on in 20 years and think it was overall a good relationship or something that was bad for your soul . \n\nWhen my former LT   SB did some work for me it was entirely separate from her sugar and worked great.  I tried to pick tasks where the experience would provide her with long term benefits including editing reports. I doubt it would have worked had we been in the office together all day .  \n\nIt was my firm so there were no stockholders being abused,  the sugar portion came out of my funds so there was no tax question  and the sugar relationship started before the working relationship. Most corporations can not afford the associated risks in today's world.",

                            "body": "My current compensation, official salary and allowance are definitely not fair for the work I'm doing. I was hired originally as a personal assistant to do work in the realm of video editing for his company, but at this point, I am doing all of the marketing, web development, video editing, and daily tasks on top of that. My allowance is honestly a joke, but combined with the slight salary increase, it was better than my current job at the time. \n\nThe sugar portion comes out of his own funds, but I think he is abusing the fact that I am around him every single day, and my allowance hasn't increased whatsoever from when we were seeing each other 3 times a month. And on top of that, the emotional effort I am now having to put in is honestly 100 times more than my boyfriend expects from me. \n\nIts really something I don't want to fix at this point. Financially and relationship wise, it is not worth it for me. It's just tricky to leave when nowhere else is hiring at what I am making currently. I should've just stuck with my other job as I was approaching a raise, but the short term raise seemed better than hanging around for a couple more months. I've definitely learned not to mix business and sugaring.",

I would like to be your lover and office assistant,not your therapist. I wish you could see a therapist.    \n5) I would like you to write me a recommendation for my work with you.  I want to still work with you but it will be nice to have for the future.  Regarding that, you should write your own letter and ask him to sign it.    \n6) continue quietly looking for a job.
