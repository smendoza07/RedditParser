And smug little sasuke thought he could handle him alone, probably assuming he couldn\u2019t be any more powerful than Naruto.\n\nAnd bee proceeds to wipe the FLOOR with this Uchiha prodigy. The sharingan could not even keep up with his speed.\n\nEdit: I just rewatched it and it\u2019s a lot longer than I remember. Never realized Killer Bee tanks a chidori in that fight. Barely even phases him. Sasuke alone doesn\u2019t even make him break a sweat. He takes a break in the middle of the fight to write down some rhymes.\n\nHe also infuses lightning chakra into the executioner\u2019s blade! I completely forgot that he got a hold of that thing.\n\nAnd he turns sasuke into a pin cushion. He essentially killed him. If Karin wasn\u2019t there, Killer Bee would have cut sasuke down without even having to use his tailed beast. Definitely a legend.",

She was also the one who realised that in order to counter Kurama's ability to overwhelm his jinch\u016briki with negative emotions, thus taking control of them, love was needed. This was information she passed on to Kushina Uzumaki, which in part helped the young woman to be able to subdue the beast within her and later helped Naruto Uzumaki to subjugate the beast.\n\nExact words \n\n > We came here to be the vessels of the Nine-Tails\u2026 But before that, we must find love and fill the vessel with it. [ Naruto chapter 500, pages 5-6]\n\n\n\nKushina had a family and friends.  \n\n\nKushina and Mito were not \u201cpublicly \u201c outed as Junchiriki, but were not cast aside or kept away from the general population either.

And how they and the village they founded were supposedly so strong and considered such a threat to the world at large that a joint attack was launched on them that destroyed Uzushiogakure and left the few surviving members of the clan to wander as refugees trying to seek out a living in the other villages, even though Konoha was apparently allied with them at the time and they have a long history of collaboration that included the Uzumaki sharing their notoriously powerful sealing techniques with them? Does anyone else think it's kinda suspicious that Kushina was brought to Konoha for the purpose of becoming the Ninetail's Jinchuriki just before the majority of the Uzumaki Clan was wiped out in the attack on Uzushiogakure? In fact wasn't part of the reason she was so lonely growing up due to the fact that she was the only person from Uzushiogakure in Konoha? If there really were such a small number of survivors, that implies that the attack on Uzushiogakure didn't discriminate between civilians and Shinobi, and that the majority of the population was killed. How did the perpetrators manage to pull that off before Konoha caught wind of the attack so that they were too late to save anyone? Also isn't it weird that the only other living members of the Uzumaki Clan introduced in the series (Karin and Nagato) never mention their last names and it seems that neither of them seem to be aware of their heritage, and that both of them lived in the smaller war-torn nations of Rain and Grass rather than the obvious choice, Konoha? \n\nWhat I'm saying here is that I've got a feeling the Uzumaki Clan and the people of Uzushiogakure as a whole might have been targeted by an international campaign of genocide, and that Konoha probably had a hand in it. \n\nEither that, or Konoha was just a really terrible and neglectful ally. \n\nHeadcanons aside though, I think the hardships suffered by the Uzumaki Clan are on par with that suffered by the Uchiha Clan, if not arguably worse.",

And smug little sasuke thought he could handle him alone, probably assuming he couldn\u2019t be any more powerful than Naruto.\n\nAnd bee proceeds to wipe the FLOOR with this Uchiha prodigy. The sharingan could not even keep up with his speed.\n\nEdit: I just rewatched it and it\u2019s a lot longer than I remember. Never realized Killer Bee tanks a chidori in that fight. Barely even phases him. Sasuke alone doesn\u2019t even make him break a sweat. He takes a break in the middle of the fight to write down some rhymes.\n\nHe also infuses lightning chakra into the executioner\u2019s blade! I completely forgot that he got a hold of that thing.\n\nAnd he turns sasuke into a pin cushion. He essentially killed him. If Karin wasn\u2019t there, Killer Bee would have cut sasuke down without even having to use his tailed beast. Definitely a legend.",

She was also the one who realised that in order to counter Kurama's ability to overwhelm his jinch\u016briki with negative emotions, thus taking control of them, love was needed. This was information she passed on to Kushina Uzumaki, which in part helped the young woman to be able to subdue the beast within her and later helped Naruto Uzumaki to subjugate the beast.\n\nExact words \n\n > We came here to be the vessels of the Nine-Tails\u2026 But before that, we must find love and fill the vessel with it. [ Naruto chapter 500, pages 5-6]\n\n\n\nKushina had a family and friends.  \n\n\nKushina and Mito were not \u201cpublicly \u201c outed as Junchiriki, but were not cast aside or kept away from the general population either.

And how they and the village they founded were supposedly so strong and considered such a threat to the world at large that a joint attack was launched on them that destroyed Uzushiogakure and left the few surviving members of the clan to wander as refugees trying to seek out a living in the other villages, even though Konoha was apparently allied with them at the time and they have a long history of collaboration that included the Uzumaki sharing their notoriously powerful sealing techniques with them? Does anyone else think it's kinda suspicious that Kushina was brought to Konoha for the purpose of becoming the Ninetail's Jinchuriki just before the majority of the Uzumaki Clan was wiped out in the attack on Uzushiogakure? In fact wasn't part of the reason she was so lonely growing up due to the fact that she was the only person from Uzushiogakure in Konoha? If there really were such a small number of survivors, that implies that the attack on Uzushiogakure didn't discriminate between civilians and Shinobi, and that the majority of the population was killed. How did the perpetrators manage to pull that off before Konoha caught wind of the attack so that they were too late to save anyone? Also isn't it weird that the only other living members of the Uzumaki Clan introduced in the series (Karin and Nagato) never mention their last names and it seems that neither of them seem to be aware of their heritage, and that both of them lived in the smaller war-torn nations of Rain and Grass rather than the obvious choice, Konoha? \n\nWhat I'm saying here is that I've got a feeling the Uzumaki Clan and the people of Uzushiogakure as a whole might have been targeted by an international campaign of genocide, and that Konoha probably had a hand in it. \n\nEither that, or Konoha was just a really terrible and neglectful ally. \n\nHeadcanons aside though, I think the hardships suffered by the Uzumaki Clan are on par with that suffered by the Uchiha Clan, if not arguably worse.",

            "body": "Hey guys, sorry if this seems unrelatable but like can we talk about the Uzumaki Clan a little? And how they and the village they founded were supposedly so strong and considered such a threat to the world at large that a joint attack was launched on them that destroyed Uzushiogakure and left the few surviving members of the clan to wander as refugees trying to seek out a living in the other villages, even though Konoha was apparently allied with them at the time and they have a long history of collaboration that included the Uzumaki sharing their notoriously powerful sealing techniques with them? Does anyone else think it's kinda suspicious that Kushina was brought to Konoha for the purpose of becoming the Ninetail's Jinchuriki just before the majority of the Uzumaki Clan was wiped out in the attack on Uzushiogakure? In fact wasn't part of the reason she was so lonely growing up due to the fact that she was the only person from Uzushiogakure in Konoha? If there really were such a small number of survivors, that implies that the attack on Uzushiogakure didn't discriminate between civilians and Shinobi, and that the majority of the population was killed. How did the perpetrators manage to pull that off before Konoha caught wind of the attack so that they were too late to save anyone? Also isn't it weird that the only other living members of the Uzumaki Clan introduced in the series (Karin and Nagato) never mention their last names and it seems that neither of them seem to be aware of their heritage, and that both of them lived in the smaller war-torn nations of Rain and Grass rather than the obvious choice, Konoha? \n\nWhat I'm saying here is that I've got a feeling the Uzumaki Clan and the people of Uzushiogakure as a whole might have been targeted by an international campaign of genocide, and that Konoha probably had a hand in it. \n\nEither that, or Konoha was just a really terrible and neglectful ally. \n\nHeadcanons aside though, I think the hardships suffered by the Uzumaki Clan are on par with that suffered by the Uchiha Clan, if not arguably worse.",

Four, Nagato\u2019s family proves that the Uzumaki were scattered long ago, since he\u2019s older than Minato/Kushina and his family had already left Uzu.",

She was also the one who realised that in order to counter Kurama's ability to overwhelm his jinch\u016briki with negative emotions, thus taking control of them, love was needed. This was information she passed on to Kushina Uzumaki, which in part helped the young woman to be able to subdue the beast within her and later helped Naruto Uzumaki to subjugate the beast.\n\nExact words \n\n > We came here to be the vessels of the Nine-Tails\u2026 But before that, we must find love and fill the vessel with it.

It\u2019s the general population who don\u2019t have the advantage of being able to fight Bijuu on equal level like Kages. \n\nLike, the Narutopedia is useless, and asserts that Mito made \u201ccontributions\u201d, but the manga implies nothing of the sort. Hell, she was the wife of the First Hokage, and absolutely *nobody* knew who she was. Same as Kushina. They weren\u2019t great ninjas. Strong, but not famous.\n\nAs for Shika and Choji, the first positive interaction they have in canon with Naruto is when Choji happens to run into Naruto at the hospital and Naruto and Shika save Lee from Gaara. Very explicitly, Sasuke is the first person who acknowledged Naruto as a peer and a friend, and it\u2019s Iruka and Team 7 who appear when Naruto recalls the people who accepted him. Shika and Choji don\u2019t join those flashbacks until Shippuden starts.\n\nFuck the anime. It\u2019s got no idea what\u2019s going on.",

She was also the one who realised that in order to counter Kurama's ability to overwhelm his jinch\u016briki with negative emotions, thus taking control of them, love was needed. This was information she passed on to Kushina Uzumaki, which in part helped the young woman to be able to subdue the beast within her and later helped Naruto Uzumaki to subjugate the beast.\n\nExact words \n\n > We came here to be the vessels of the Nine-Tails\u2026 But before that, we must find love and fill the vessel with it. [ Naruto chapter 500, pages 5-6]\n\n\n\nKushina had a family and friends.  \n\n\nKushina and Mito were not \u201cpublicly \u201c outed as Junchiriki, but were not cast aside or kept away from the general population either. Which proves my point.  Being ostracized is not making Junchirik\u2019s stronger.  You can be a strong ninja without being pushed aside by your village.",

Hell, she was the wife of the First Hokage, and absolutely *nobody* knew who she was. Same as Kushina. They weren\u2019t great ninjas. Strong, but not famous.\n\nAs for Shika and Choji, the first positive interaction they have in canon with Naruto is when Choji happens to run into Naruto at the hospital and Naruto and Shika save Lee from Gaara. Very explicitly, Sasuke is the first person who acknowledged Naruto as a peer and a friend, and it\u2019s Iruka and Team 7 who appear when Naruto recalls the people who accepted him.

She was also the one who realised that in order to counter Kurama's ability to overwhelm his jinch\u016briki with negative emotions, thus taking control of them, love was needed. This was information she passed on to Kushina Uzumaki, which in part helped the young woman to be able to subdue the beast within her and later helped Naruto Uzumaki to subjugate the beast.\n\nExact words \n\n > We came here to be the vessels of the Nine-Tails\u2026 But before that, we must find love and fill the vessel with it. [ Naruto chapter 500, pages 5-6]\n\n\n\nKushina had a family and friends.  \n\n\nKushina and Mito were not \u201cpublicly \u201c outed as Junchiriki, but were not cast aside or kept away from the general population either. Which proves my point.  Being ostracized is not making Junchirik\u2019s stronger.  You can be a strong ninja without being pushed aside by your village.",

Hell, she was the wife of the First Hokage, and absolutely *nobody* knew who she was. Same as Kushina. They weren\u2019t great ninjas. Strong, but not famous.\n\nAs for Shika and Choji, the first positive interaction they have in canon with Naruto is when Choji happens to run into Naruto at the hospital and Naruto and Shika save Lee from Gaara. Very explicitly, Sasuke is the first person who acknowledged Naruto as a peer and a friend, and it\u2019s Iruka and Team 7 who appear when Naruto recalls the people who accepted him. Shika and Choji don\u2019t join those flashbacks until Shippuden starts.\n\nFuck the anime. It\u2019s got no idea what\u2019s going on.",

Shikamaru and choji were Naruto\u2019s friends as kids\n\nQuote from Natutopedia about Mito\u2019s tought about being a Junchiriki \n\n> Mito made great contributions in the way of protecting Konohagakure after becoming the beast's jinch\u016briki. She was also the one who realised that in order to counter Kurama's ability to overwhelm his jinch\u016briki with negative emotions, thus taking control of them, love was needed. This was information she passed on to Kushina Uzumaki, which in part helped the young woman to be able to subdue the beast within her and later helped Naruto Uzumaki to subjugate the beast.\n\nExact words \n\n > We came here to be the vessels of the Nine-Tails\u2026 But before that, we must find love and fill the vessel with it. [ Naruto chapter 500, pages 5-6]\n\n\n\nKushina had a family and friends.  \n\n\nKushina and Mito were not \u201cpublicly \u201c outed as Junchiriki, but were not cast aside or kept away from the general population either. Which proves my point.  Being ostracized is not making Junchirik\u2019s stronger.  You can be a strong ninja without being pushed aside by your village.",

Hell, she was the wife of the First Hokage, and absolutely *nobody* knew who she was. Same as Kushina. They weren\u2019t great ninjas. Strong, but not famous.\n\nAs for Shika and Choji, the first positive interaction they have in canon with Naruto is when Choji happens to run into Naruto at the hospital and Naruto and Shika save Lee from Gaara. Very explicitly, Sasuke is the first person who acknowledged Naruto as a peer and a friend, and it\u2019s Iruka and Team 7 who appear when Naruto recalls the people who accepted him. Shika and Choji don\u2019t join those flashbacks until Shippuden starts.\n\nFuck the anime. It\u2019s got no idea what\u2019s going on.",

Hell, she was the wife of the First Hokage, and absolutely *nobody* knew who she was. Same as Kushina. They weren\u2019t great ninjas. Strong, but not famous.\n\nAs for Shika and Choji, the first positive interaction they have in canon with Naruto is when Choji happens to run into Naruto at the hospital and Naruto and Shika save Lee from Gaara. Very explicitly, Sasuke is the first person who acknowledged Naruto as a peer and a friend, and it\u2019s Iruka and Team 7 who appear when Naruto recalls the people who accepted him. Shika and Choji don\u2019t join those flashbacks until Shippuden starts.\n\nFuck the anime. It\u2019s got no idea what\u2019s going on.",
