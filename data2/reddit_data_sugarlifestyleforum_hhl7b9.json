    "body": "Hey all, first post here and I wanted to share a funny story. \n\nOn June 16th, I messaged a girl on SA with a corny joke since she said she likes those in her profile. She got back to me a few days later, and while the conversation always involved days of no response on her end, I eventually got her number and began texting her. \n\nLast Wednesday, the 24th, we set up a M&G at a nice Italian restaurant by the water for drinks on the 28th, today. She followed up with a plea for me to send her $9 because her Netflix ran out and she was laid off due to Covid, and she promised to pay me back.\n\nNormally this is a red flag scam, and I would never send money before the M&T. But this was literally just $9, so I Cashapped her and told her to enjoy Tiger King :D.\n\nYesterday, I text her twice to ask if we're still good for meeting today. No response. This morning, I text her again with no response.\n\nFolks I just got scammed for $9 lol. This is a first for me.",

So I\u2019m outer and irresponsible and it\u2019s happening on both sides which is why I\u2019ve all but given up. I just want a happy, caring mutually beneficial relationship, and as of recently everyone seems to be out solely for numero uno. Makes me sad and like there\u2019s not much hope.

What you seem to not realize is not only is the 9$ like pennies to many of us, so is the 80x9. Who cares if scammers are out there. Most of us have enough checklists in place(including the OP, he says so himself, he just ignored it) that these pennies are all they get, and we maybe hit one or two max before finding someone who does play it straight, and they get taken care of for doing so, assuredly. Who cares about the scammers. My personal feeling, and I''ve been off and on in the bowl for ten wonderful years.",

So I\u2019m outer and irresponsible and it\u2019s happening on both sides which is why I\u2019ve all but given up. I just want a happy, caring mutually beneficial relationship, and as of recently everyone seems to be out solely for numero uno. Makes me sad and like there\u2019s not much hope.

Most of us have enough checklists in place(including the OP, he says so himself, he just ignored it) that these pennies are all they get, and we maybe hit one or two max before finding someone who does play it straight, and they get taken care of for doing so, assuredly. Who cares about the scammers. My personal feeling, and I''ve been off and on in the bowl for ten wonderful years.",

What you seem to not realize is not only is the 9$ like pennies to many of us, so is the 80x9. Who cares if scammers are out there. Most of us have enough checklists in place(including the OP, he says so himself, he just ignored it) that these pennies are all they get, and we maybe hit one or two max before finding someone who does play it straight, and they get taken care of for doing so, assuredly. Who cares about the scammers. My personal feeling, and I''ve been off and on in the bowl for ten wonderful years.",
