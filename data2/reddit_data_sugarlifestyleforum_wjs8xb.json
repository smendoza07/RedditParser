As for what you have posted about the truth of said weekly allowance, on top of that endless shopping and plastic surgery so the allowance may as well have been 10K a month. A SB is just a sex worker who wants money to fuck and they advertise their wares on online sites dedicated strictly to them finding someone who will pay for company and sex. So a SB attracts bragging rights and they are a commodity. If they were just being paid for their company then they might not be. Prostitutes and strippers are commonly farmed out to various establishments because the owners of those establishments pay their agents for a new commodity for them to turn a dollar with. Thinking that a prostitute who has sex for money and a SB who has sex for money are any different is a sad reflection of your generation and fighting in Vietnam and Korea. We are not living in the 1950's anymore and you can thank females such as Germaine Greer for the empowered commodity called a SB being able to advertise online to get paid to provide sexual services. Your bullshit means that your name should be stressed dickhead and not Chill\\_SD.",

That's why you call them prostitutes. Change your mindset and maybe you'll get something meaningful sometime instead of being a pervy grouch. \n\nWomen are actually human beings. \n\nYou as a guy don't sound like one. You sound animalistic.",

As for what you have posted about the truth of said weekly allowance, on top of that endless shopping and plastic surgery so the allowance may as well have been 10K a month. A SB is just a sex worker who wants money to fuck and they advertise their wares on online sites dedicated strictly to them finding someone who will pay for company and sex. So a SB attracts bragging rights and they are a commodity. If they were just being paid for their company then they might not be. Prostitutes and strippers are commonly farmed out to various establishments because the owners of those establishments pay their agents for a new commodity for them to turn a dollar with. Thinking that a prostitute who has sex for money and a SB who has sex for money are any different is a sad reflection of your generation and fighting in Vietnam and Korea. We are not living in the 1950's anymore and you can thank females such as Germaine Greer for the empowered commodity called a SB being able to advertise online to get paid to provide sexual services. Your bullshit means that your name should be stressed dickhead and not Chill\\_SD.",

As for what you have posted about the truth of said weekly allowance, on top of that endless shopping and plastic surgery so the allowance may as well have been 10K a month. A SB is just a sex worker who wants money to fuck and they advertise their wares on online sites dedicated strictly to them finding someone who will pay for company and sex. So a SB attracts bragging rights and they are a commodity. If they were just being paid for their company then they might not be. Prostitutes and strippers are commonly farmed out to various establishments because the owners of those establishments pay their agents for a new commodity for them to turn a dollar with. Thinking that a prostitute who has sex for money and a SB who has sex for money are any different is a sad reflection of your generation and fighting in Vietnam and Korea. We are not living in the 1950's anymore and you can thank females such as Germaine Greer for the empowered commodity called a SB being able to advertise online to get paid to provide sexual services. Your bullshit means that your name should be stressed dickhead and not Chill\\_SD.",

As for what you have posted about the truth of said weekly allowance, on top of that endless shopping and plastic surgery so the allowance may as well have been 10K a month. A SB is just a sex worker who wants money to fuck and they advertise their wares on online sites dedicated strictly to them finding someone who will pay for company and sex. So a SB attracts bragging rights and they are a commodity. If they were just being paid for their company then they might not be. Prostitutes and strippers are commonly farmed out to various establishments because the owners of those establishments pay their agents for a new commodity for them to turn a dollar with. Thinking that a prostitute who has sex for money and a SB who has sex for money are any different is a sad reflection of your generation and fighting in Vietnam and Korea. We are not living in the 1950's anymore and you can thank females such as Germaine Greer for the empowered commodity called a SB being able to advertise online to get paid to provide sexual services.

As for what you have posted about the truth of said weekly allowance, on top of that endless shopping and plastic surgery so the allowance may as well have been 10K a month. A SB is just a sex worker who wants money to fuck and they advertise their wares on online sites dedicated strictly to them finding someone who will pay for company and sex. So a SB attracts bragging rights and they are a commodity. If they were just being paid for their company then they might not be. Prostitutes and strippers are commonly farmed out to various establishments because the owners of those establishments pay their agents for a new commodity for them to turn a dollar with. Thinking that a prostitute who has sex for money and a SB who has sex for money are any different is a sad reflection of your generation and fighting in Vietnam and Korea. We are not living in the 1950's anymore and you can thank females such as Germaine Greer for the empowered commodity called a SB being able to advertise online to get paid to provide sexual services.

A SB is just a sex worker who wants money to fuck and they advertise their wares on online sites dedicated strictly to them finding someone who will pay for company and sex. So a SB attracts bragging rights and they are a commodity. If they were just being paid for their company then they might not be. Prostitutes and strippers are commonly farmed out to various establishments because the owners of those establishments pay their agents for a new commodity for them to turn a dollar with. Thinking that a prostitute who has sex for money and a SB who has sex for money are any different is a sad reflection of your generation and fighting in Vietnam and Korea. We are not living in the 1950's anymore and you can thank females such as Germaine Greer for the empowered commodity called a SB being able to advertise online to get paid to provide sexual services.

As for what you have posted about the truth of said weekly allowance, on top of that endless shopping and plastic surgery so the allowance may as well have been 10K a month. A SB is just a sex worker who wants money to fuck and they advertise their wares on online sites dedicated strictly to them finding someone who will pay for company and sex. So a SB attracts bragging rights and they are a commodity. If they were just being paid for their company then they might not be. Prostitutes and strippers are commonly farmed out to various establishments because the owners of those establishments pay their agents for a new commodity for them to turn a dollar with. Thinking that a prostitute who has sex for money and a SB who has sex for money are any different is a sad reflection of your generation and fighting in Vietnam and Korea. We are not living in the 1950's anymore and you can thank females such as Germaine Greer for the empowered commodity called a SB being able to advertise online to get paid to provide sexual services.

I prefer to have 1 at a time.\n\nSo I'm going to stick with the obvious fact that it is absolutely a \"buyers market\" for SDs looking for wonderful SBs. \n\nOlder, bad attitude, SBs without top tier looks are facing pretty grim and slim prospects.",

As for what you have posted about the truth of said weekly allowance, on top of that endless shopping and plastic surgery so the allowance may as well have been 10K a month. A SB is just a sex worker who wants money to fuck and they advertise their wares on online sites dedicated strictly to them finding someone who will pay for company and sex. So a SB attracts bragging rights and they are a commodity. If they were just being paid for their company then they might not be. Prostitutes and strippers are commonly farmed out to various establishments because the owners of those establishments pay their agents for a new commodity for them to turn a dollar with. Thinking that a prostitute who has sex for money and a SB who has sex for money are any different is a sad reflection of your generation and fighting in Vietnam and Korea. We are not living in the 1950's anymore and you can thank females such as Germaine Greer for the empowered commodity called a SB being able to advertise online to get paid to provide sexual services. Your bullshit means that your name should be stressed dickhead and not Chill\\_SD.",
