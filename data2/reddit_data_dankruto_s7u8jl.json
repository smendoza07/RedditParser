I can only assume he had a decent plan to finish the series in a logical/decent way, but eventually he got offered so much money to keep the franchise going that he abandoned it and rushed his way to an end for Shippuden. I can\u2019t blame him, for millions of dollars I\u2019d do far worse than botch the ending of my cartoon about ninjas.",

Before, someone in his court insulted him that his enemy could pluck out one of his buldging eyes, which resulted from a disease he had as a kid. This led him (or his friend, historians aren\u2019t sure) gouging his own eye out.\n\nFucking Metal AF.\n\n\nThis in combination to is prowess in the battlefield, earned him the nickname \u201cthe one eyed dragon of Oshu\u201d",

Some of the evidence supporting this theory is the fact that Kenshin had severe stomach cramps on a monthly basis around the 10th of the month (recorded in the K\u014dy\u014d Gunkan) and actually planned his military campaigns around these cramps. Also, the cause of Kenshin's death is recorded in Matsudaira Tadaaki's history \"T\u014ddaiki\" (\u5f53\u4ee3\u8a18) as a form of uterine cancer (\u5927\u866b).",

Despite the loss of an eye, he continued to fight, and he eventually went on to single-handedly capture 93 soldiers during the Battle of the Scheldt in Zeeland in the southern Netherlands. As if that wasn't enough, he then went on to single-handedly liberate the entire Dutch town of Zwolle from it's Nazi occupiers, sparing the town from an Allied bombardment that had been planned in case the reconnaissance team determined that the town's defenses would be too difficult to infiltrate on foot. Suffice to say, Leo had it covered.\n\nI swear, if it wasn't for historical documentation, I wouldn't even believe that the guy existed.",

Optical nerves are part of the central nerve system rather than the peripheral nervous system, they have different kinds of nerve sheathes. Did they design Danzo's arm specifically to be able to hold a bunch of sockets for the eyes? Does the arm contain the orbital bone structures necessary to house them, and if so how the hell does that arm still have the range of motion that it does? Because they couldn't have just shoved the eyes in between the muscles of the arm, that would lead to the eyeballs being compressed every time the muscles tensed or relaxed.",

Some of the evidence supporting this theory is the fact that Kenshin had severe stomach cramps on a monthly basis around the 10th of the month (recorded in the K\u014dy\u014d Gunkan) and actually planned his military campaigns around these cramps. Also, the cause of Kenshin's death is recorded in Matsudaira Tadaaki's history \"T\u014ddaiki\" (\u5f53\u4ee3\u8a18) as a form of uterine cancer (\u5927\u866b).",

Despite the loss of an eye, he continued to fight, and he eventually went on to single-handedly capture 93 soldiers during the Battle of the Scheldt in Zeeland in the southern Netherlands. As if that wasn't enough, he then went on to single-handedly liberate the entire Dutch town of Zwolle from it's Nazi occupiers, sparing the town from an Allied bombardment that had been planned in case the reconnaissance team determined that the town's defenses would be too difficult to infiltrate on foot. Suffice to say, Leo had it covered.\n\nI swear, if it wasn't for historical documentation, I wouldn't even believe that the guy existed.",

Optical nerves are part of the central nerve system rather than the peripheral nervous system, they have different kinds of nerve sheathes. Did they design Danzo's arm specifically to be able to hold a bunch of sockets for the eyes? Does the arm contain the orbital bone structures necessary to house them, and if so how the hell does that arm still have the range of motion that it does? Because they couldn't have just shoved the eyes in between the muscles of the arm, that would lead to the eyeballs being compressed every time the muscles tensed or relaxed.",

Some of the evidence supporting this theory is the fact that Kenshin had severe stomach cramps on a monthly basis around the 10th of the month (recorded in the K\u014dy\u014d Gunkan) and actually planned his military campaigns around these cramps. Also, the cause of Kenshin's death is recorded in Matsudaira Tadaaki's history \"T\u014ddaiki\" (\u5f53\u4ee3\u8a18) as a form of uterine cancer (\u5927\u866b).",

            "body": "You'd think that, but there was this one French Canadian soldier named [Leo Major](https://youtu.be/eFf1UfVa8Lc) who lost an eye to a phosphorous grenade thrown by a member of an SS patrol that he came across while doing reconnaissance in Normandy on D-Day. Despite the loss of an eye, he continued to fight, and he eventually went on to single-handedly capture 93 soldiers during the Battle of the Scheldt in Zeeland in the southern Netherlands. As if that wasn't enough, he then went on to single-handedly liberate the entire Dutch town of Zwolle from it's Nazi occupiers, sparing the town from an Allied bombardment that had been planned in case the reconnaissance team determined that the town's defenses would be too difficult to infiltrate on foot. Suffice to say, Leo had it covered.\n\nI swear, if it wasn't for historical documentation, I wouldn't even believe that the guy existed.",

Optical nerves are part of the central nerve system rather than the peripheral nervous system, they have different kinds of nerve sheathes. Did they design Danzo's arm specifically to be able to hold a bunch of sockets for the eyes? Does the arm contain the orbital bone structures necessary to house them, and if so how the hell does that arm still have the range of motion that it does? Because they couldn't have just shoved the eyes in between the muscles of the arm, that would lead to the eyeballs being compressed every time the muscles tensed or relaxed.",

I can only assume he had a decent plan to finish the series in a logical/decent way, but eventually he got offered so much money to keep the franchise going that he abandoned it and rushed his way to an end for Shippuden.

Some of the evidence supporting this theory is the fact that Kenshin had severe stomach cramps on a monthly basis around the 10th of the month (recorded in the K\u014dy\u014d Gunkan) and actually planned his military campaigns around these cramps. Also, the cause of Kenshin's death is recorded in Matsudaira Tadaaki's history \"T\u014ddaiki\" (\u5f53\u4ee3\u8a18) as a form of uterine cancer (\u5927\u866b).",

Optical nerves are part of the central nerve system rather than the peripheral nervous system, they have different kinds of nerve sheathes. Did they design Danzo's arm specifically to be able to hold a bunch of sockets for the eyes? Does the arm contain the orbital bone structures necessary to house them, and if so how the hell does that arm still have the range of motion that it does? Because they couldn't have just shoved the eyes in between the muscles of the arm, that would lead to the eyeballs being compressed every time the muscles tensed or relaxed.",

I love it but it\u2019s absurd. \n\nThe whole tail end of the war arc is *very* clearly Kishimoto pulling shit out of his ass to justify the franchise\u2019s continuation. I can only assume he had a decent plan to finish the series in a logical/decent way, but eventually he got offered so much money to keep the franchise going that he abandoned it and rushed his way to an end for Shippuden. I can\u2019t blame him, for millions of dollars I\u2019d do far worse than botch the ending of my cartoon about ninjas.",
