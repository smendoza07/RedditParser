Kakashi was a negligent teacher, acting more like a chaperone when that was only really appropriate in Shippuden. The only time he really took the time to teach them something was tree-walking, and only because they had to deal with more powerful people than they were equipped for. The fact that tree walking is just a control exercise (one every ninja likes _has_ to learn at some point) doesn\u2019t help. When Team 7 learned things, it was usually for some Exciting Plot point with other characters, not anything from Kakashi, and it ended up undermining what it must mean to be a ninja and Kakashi\u2019s own status as a teacher as a result.",

But again, that has to be the bear minimum, here. The problem with at least the other Teams is that they were clan children that were learning their clan techniques - they had less holes to fill than Kakashi could have, as he had orphans and a non clan child to teach. And I\u2019m just gonna focus more on Kakashi because we can follow his team and extrapolate the world from there, as that was also the intent of the writing to begin with.\n\nAnd as I stated before, the bulk of their learning was used for plot points that other people had a hand in, and it makes Kakashi\u2019s own onscreen and implied teachings look weak in comparison. Of course they learned offscreen, but what we saw onscreen showed a very disinterested Kakashi. Kishimoto did not well support the idea of Kakashi being a hands-on and attentive teacher, because that was _not_ what he displayed when he had the chance to do so. Having short montages of Kakashi correcting a stance as they spar, testing them like he did in the bell test, teaching them something new or making them learn it on their own would have done worlds of good at actually supporting the \u201cthey train offscreen, and he\u2019s also a good and attentive teacher\u201d idea, because the training we knew they\u2019d did, we knew Kakashi hadn\u2019t been a part of it. If your implied reality does not mesh with the concrete one that you made, that\u2019s not good writing and makes your own work a contradiction. Kakashi is a teacher who _presumably_ taught them and helped them hone their techniques, but the fact that I can\u2019t be confident in that with what we\u2019re given in canon means that that wasn\u2019t well written. People make a point to have Kakashi be a more attentive teacher (if he\u2019s made to be a good teacher at all) - in even throw-away lines for a _reason._ Many felt that he may have been lacking, so they make a point to address that in a reality they can shape themselves.\n\nIf more of the training was used to further flesh out the world instead of for points of conflicts like excitement, this likely wouldn\u2019t have happened. I mean, let\u2019s start with Wave - the first thing Kakashi presumably taught them is tree-walking - something that is clearly a control exercise, and something that is likely the basics for ninja to learn, and only after they are made to face the fact that they are not prepared for these circumstances. Kakashi hadn\u2019t been planning to teach them this very soon otherwise. What Sasuke and Naruto used to fight are not things they learned under Kakashi, either, but things they learned on their own, and decided on their own. \n\nHim teaching it is nothing special, and honestly feels like he should have been teaching them this earlier, especially when you remember that they only did the presumable \u201cnext step\u201d of this with water-walking months after having learned this, and Kakashi had declined teaching them most of them that himself. It was likely that Kishimoto only thought of this much later, but the fact still remains that Kakashi actively decided against teaching his own students that skill himself, and again, only brought it up to deal with a threat they hadn\u2019t been prepared to face reactively, rather than proactively. And it\u2019s also only assumed that all 3 learned this technique at all.",

He didn\u2019t tell Naruto that he wasn\u2019t gonna help him train for the Chunin Exams until the last minute, and he chose a teacher that actively does not like Naruto. He left Naruto high in dry in the most disrespectful way. He could have sought Naruto out himself and told him that he wasn\u2019t available to teach him but still give him tips and advice to help him train and succeed while he was gone. That would have taken, what, an extra 3 minutes? And if he was gonna chose a teacher for him, he should have chosen someone who wasn\u2019t gonna be a dick about it - Naruto has dealt with teachers and adults who have despised his very existence and was nearly murdered by one - why would you make Naruto rely on someone who dislikes him so obviously? \nNaruto appropriately ditched Ebisu before having found a teacher in Jiraiya. Kakashi made Naruto\u2019s learning Naruto\u2019s problem, which is completely inappropriate and clearly negligent. Kakashi acted as if he couldn\u2019t care about Naruto\u2019s education at all, and that it was a burden he happily tossed onto the first person he saw. He didn\u2019t have to act like that, but he did. He didn\u2019t need to teach Naruto, but he certainly should and could have been less flippant about not being there to help him, and about Naruto\u2019s own legitimate worries when Naruto rightly sought him out for guidance that he couldn\u2019t/wouldn\u2019t give. That\u2019s how Kishimoto wrote that scene, largely out of an attempt to make it humorous, but that\u2019s not how it was when you get to the barebones of it.\n\nAnd let\u2019s get into the Chuunin Exams - first of all, Kakashi knows damn well that inexperienced people can and will die, so why he didn\u2019t take preparing them a bit more seriously before then doesn\u2019t make sense. He had the opportunity to be more proactive, but he wasn\u2019t. He was at least reactive when it came to Zabuza, but why he couldn\u2019t have made sure they were more prepared by teaching at least something like the water walking _now_ doesn\u2019t add up right. He also didn\u2019t really tell them that people will attempt to murder them in this test and to prepare to fight against that - instead, they learned that from their own peers because Kishimoto wanted to make some Dramatic Tension, but he makes it so that Kakashi very much under prepares them in hindsight, and everything only ended up okay because of more Plot Armor than usual.\nAnother aspect of the Exams is how uncharacteristically unconcerned Kishimoto writes the authorities of Konoha to be. Orochimaru attacks, and you don\u2019t investigate more about what he did while he did so? You don\u2019t interrogate the people who faced him first hand, your own people who were made his victims? Really? I\u2019m pretty sure his henchmen were interrogated, but not at least checking in with the Konoha nin that fought them and encoring weed Orochimaru himself doesn\u2019t make much sense.\n\nHow did no one question how things went down in detail? If they did, Naruto would have said he was attacked by some strange technique that didn\u2019t seem to do anything - and he should have gotten a checkup to determine if that was really the case and then they would have figured out his chakra was sealed. The fact that Jiraiya only fixed that by chance makes all the authority around Naruto seem more negligent. Naruto would have mentioned Orochimaru attacking him, and they could have found the seal that way. Jiraiya only figured it out because Naruto was failing miserably with water walking, so he figured there was something wrong with his chakra. Ebisu wouldn\u2019t have thought something was wrong with Naruto\u2019s chakra, and would have just blamed it on Naruto not trying hard enough or being good enough or something. If Kakashi had been around to teach him himself, he would have realized something was wrong, and may have asked him to do something like tree-walk for a moment to see if it was maybe Naruto doing the practice wrong or something being wrong with him. \n\nNaruto was attacked, and no one did anything about it, and while he wasn\u2019t in pain or anything, he still had to deal with the consequences of such an attack longer than he had to - no one even stopped to think of something _could_ have been wrong with Naruto after having fought with Orochimaru. Being the Jinchuruuki should have made Konoha authorities more paranoid to make sure Orochimaru didn\u2019t do anything to him, because he\u2019s a person with interesting chakra and Orochimaru is the kind of person who would have been even vaguely interested in that. He wouldn\u2019t have made Naruto his body, but that doesn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t have done something to him, anyway. Check all your bases, damnit. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that Sasuke is made late to the Exams because of the Kakashi - stricter places would have rightfully disqualified them. It was an arrogant move used for a Dramatic entrance, and that\u2019s just not a good look. \n\nKakashi usually attempts to teach Team 7 something after a conflict, so why he didn\u2019t suggest teaching them something after the invasion is weird. Maybe teaching them more about genjutsu for when everyone was caught in it after the invasion? Teaching them a long distance attack? A new technique to handle something close range? Setting up training exercises with the other Konoha teams to foster togetherness and teamwork? Something. The way Naruto fought in the attack using tags was more likely something Naruto himself came up with, honestly, as he\u2019s set up traps for people before he even graduated - using tags to be more lethal is something he didn\u2019t need help coming up with.\n\nAnd I\u2019m focusing on Part 1 because that is the time where he was their primary guardian - he\u2019s in charge of their learning, and if he can\u2019t teach them something, he\u2019s to direct them to someone who can. He\u2019s there to make sure that they can use what they learned in the academy in the field, and to help them understand and learn that makes a ninja a ninja in practice, and not on paper. He is to guide them into being leaders themselves (becoming Chuunin and Jounin), and understanding where their specialties may lie and honing that. He doesn\u2019t seem to have done much toward that, mostly cultivating them mentally and less physically than he seemingly should have in hindsight. An example people like to point out for good reason is Sakura - she had been a blank slate that Kishimoto _constantly_ underutilized, and made it so that he learning only really kicked off after Part 1. Kakashi made a throw-away comment about her having good potential for genjutsu or something (during Wave or the first Bell Test), yet he\u2018s shown to not even put that idea into practice. The only thing he was shown to teach her was tree-walking - she didn\u2019t get far in the tournament, but he could have assigned her to do water-walking in the mean time but I don\u2019t think he did. Sakura has the most to learn from him, and for a man said to have a thousand jutsu, not teaching any of his students even one each is an utter waste.\n\nAnd when he _does_ teach Naruto in Shippuden, it\u2019s used as an exposition for the audience to explain chakra natures. The problem with that is that this is a lesson that is clearly a kind of basic understanding most Shinobi are _supposed_ to learn, and likely earlier than Naruto is now - once they begin seriously training and learning and mastering Jutsu, which Was a stage Naruto has been at years ago. Naruto is supposed to be strong enough to be a Chuunin, but he hadn\u2019t even learned this under years of attentive teaching with Jiraiya. He also likely would have learned this had he learned other Jutsu, but he doesn\u2019t.",

Kakashi is supposed to be a good and attentive teacher, but the opportunities that we had in canon to support that doesn\u2019t _actually_ support that. You instead have to more or less ignore the implications of what\u2019s actually written as onscreen support of and instead have to assume he was better offscreen. Kakashi as a teacher suffers as a character because Kishimoto did not properly support that aspect of him because he was focused on making things Interesting, not make his world building make sense. Kishimoto\u2019s world building takes a backseat a bit too often with how many things don\u2019t seem to make sense as they should. That\u2019s to be expected, but it tends to happen a bit too often and early in Naruto\u2019s writing, but it isn\u2019t well addressed even later. Kishimoto had a lot of great ideas, but his shoddy execution had the story suffer for it, and Kakashi as a teacher is just one of them. One of the main reasons his other manga he released a few years ago failed is because he kept rushing things without properly fleshing them out, and the story very much suffered for it. Kakashi is more a victim of Kishimoto not being nearly as good of a writer as the story needed him to be, and I stand by that idea very strongly.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m taking this too seriously, but I wanted to try to explain why \u201cKakashi is not as good of a teacher as he\u2019s supposed to be\u201d is something I very much transcribe to. I love Kakashi and I love his potential, and as much as I love the idea of him being a good teacher to Team 7, the reality of canon doesn\u2019t really support that. The only reason it stands as strong as it does is simply because he\u2019s constantly supposed to be read that way - \u201cbecause Kishimoto says so,\u201d not because the canon supports that. He\u2019s like Sakura - she has a lot of great potential and is definitely _supposed_ to be a very strong and formidable ninja in her own right, it\u2019s just that Kishimoto actively avoided displaying that in the canon under the excuse that he \u201ccan\u2019t write girls\u201d or something. It\u2019s why her best show of acting on that potential was during the last arc during a war, rather than during the times she _did_ fight fights that were rather lackluster and few incomparison to even more minor side characters. For a major character, he doesn\u2019t really treat her like one. She was more than a healer, and very capable in an outright fight. Kishimoto not putting effort into actually having Sakura put her money where her mouth is is why she\u2019s such a hated and \u201cuseless\u201d character.",

That\u2019s really not an argument _agaisnt_ what I\u2019m saying, and more of a support for it. And we can count on one hand the when we saw Kakashi make a point to teach his 3 students something at all, and most of them were before or during the Chunin Exam and only when their lives were in immediate danger - he didn\u2019t take the time to train them when it was peaceful, which is stupid. What about after? And why not more? Why not short, training montages of Kakashi having them spar and him Kakashi guiding them through techniques? Kakashi is shown time and time again to be instead _negligent_ and uninterested in furthering their skills. \nAnd Naruto learned Wind control under him in Shippuden, right? When he wasn\u2019t their primary teacher anymore? While Naruto was mastering a technique Kakashi had no hand in helping him learn? That really doesn\u2019t lend evidence to the fact that Kakashi was an excellent teacher, but more evidence how how could and otherwise would have been a better teacher if Kishimoto bothered to remember that he\u2019s a teacher at all. That instance was not a typical student-teacher relationship like they initially had, but more of something closer to equals, which is an interesting and cool aspect of their dynamic, but not one that shows off the teacher Kakashi _should_ have been, as Naruto was no longer his student. It was more like helping a coworker at your job with something they\u2019re inexperienced with, as Kakashi didn\u2019t really need to help Naruto here, and he wouldn\u2019t have been otherwise drafted for the help anyway. His help was a surprise, and not an expectation, and when his help _was_ an expectation, he didn\u2019t do anything.",

I really don't know how they can be considered co-workers here.\n\nBesides that, how would you explain Naruto and Sakura's sudden growth if Kakashi was such a terrible teacher?\n\nOut of all the teams Kakashi's team went the furthest in the fighting competition part of the chunin exams. This was despite the fact they faced opponents who were better than them during the academy days.\n\n [These grades are from a data book.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NarutoFanfiction/comments/hr7w7g/narutos_and_his_classmates_academy_grades/fy2g5nf/?context=3) \n\nSo either Asuma and Kurenai were terrible teachers who somehow managed to weaken their students or Kakashi was a great teacher who was able to Improve his students skills to the point where they were able to fight opponents who were once stronger than them and win.\n\nAnd we obviously know that he taught Sasuke the chidori, which ended up being one of Sasuke's most resourceful jutsus.

I mean, prior to Shippuden, look at how many people you could definitively say ranked higher than him: the Sannin (who are some of the most skilled ninja in the world even at the end of the series), the Third Hokage (a man whose literal title was \"the God of Shinobi\"), and Itachi (who was a prodigy among prodigies *and* had Sharinghax to boot). And speaking of Itachi, him and Kakashi are actually very similar - extremely skilled, but actually fairly weak, lacking the power to back it up. The difference is that Itachi had the Mangekyo to make up for that, which Kakashi couldn't properly use until it was far too late for it to make a meaningful difference.\n\nIt's the typical shounen problem where the gap between #1 and #5 is exponentially greater than the gap between #5 and #10, when in reality, the closer you get to the top, the smaller the differences really are. Kakashi is actually a really well rounded character in terms of combat capabilities - dangerous, skilled, and has a trump card or two, but has believable weaknesses to keep them in check. The problem is that most of the characters that were relevant by the end *weren't* balanced - this is evident from how Kakashi seemingly ignored the chakra and stamina issues that kept him from overusing the Chidori and spamming Kamui throughout most of the series with no explanation as to how that happened; throwing out that balance was necessary to even keep him in the battle without immediately biting it.",

Naruto was practically the same even after time skip. \n\nMinato might have been cool as a Hokage but he was the worst teacher. He didn't teach any of his students shit. I also loved the irony in his character. He was the fastest shinobi in his time but was always late in saving his students. Kakashi on the other hand was never late in saving his students.\n\nAlso Naruto and Sasuke use Chidori and Rasenshuriken as their base form for any of their attacks. Discrediting his value is completely stupid on your part. As for Sakura I agree he should have taught her more taijutsu when he was training Naruto Rasenshuriken. \n\nAnd everytime people bring that stupid favouritism bullshit even though they have seen the story is nothing more than ignorance. I am not gonna dive into that bullshit  \n\nSo stop pretending that he was the worst teacher. When Hiruzen and Minato were much worse than him.",

It\u2019s just that that\u2019s the only time Kakashi showed so much interest and attentiveness to their development at all. I\u2019m not counting Kakashi helping Naruto in Shippuden because he wasn\u2019t Naruto\u2019s primary teacher anymore, and he only helped him refine a technique he already had, rather than teach him something completely new. Kakashi was a negligent teacher, acting more like a chaperone when that was only really appropriate in Shippuden. The only time he really took the time to teach them something was tree-walking, and only because they had to deal with more powerful people than they were equipped for. The fact that tree walking is just a control exercise (one every ninja likes _has_ to learn at some point) doesn\u2019t help. When Team 7 learned things, it was usually for some Exciting Plot point with other characters, not anything from Kakashi, and it ended up undermining what it must mean to be a ninja and Kakashi\u2019s own status as a teacher as a result.",

The problem with at least the other Teams is that they were clan children that were learning their clan techniques - they had less holes to fill than Kakashi could have, as he had orphans and a non clan child to teach. And I\u2019m just gonna focus more on Kakashi because we can follow his team and extrapolate the world from there, as that was also the intent of the writing to begin with.\n\nAnd as I stated before, the bulk of their learning was used for plot points that other people had a hand in, and it makes Kakashi\u2019s own onscreen and implied teachings look weak in comparison. Of course they learned offscreen, but what we saw onscreen showed a very disinterested Kakashi. Kishimoto did not well support the idea of Kakashi being a hands-on and attentive teacher, because that was _not_ what he displayed when he had the chance to do so. Having short montages of Kakashi correcting a stance as they spar, testing them like he did in the bell test, teaching them something new or making them learn it on their own would have done worlds of good at actually supporting the \u201cthey train offscreen, and he\u2019s also a good and attentive teacher\u201d idea, because the training we knew they\u2019d did, we knew Kakashi hadn\u2019t been a part of it. If your implied reality does not mesh with the concrete one that you made, that\u2019s not good writing and makes your own work a contradiction. Kakashi is a teacher who _presumably_ taught them and helped them hone their techniques, but the fact that I can\u2019t be confident in that with what we\u2019re given in canon means that that wasn\u2019t well written. People make a point to have Kakashi be a more attentive teacher (if he\u2019s made to be a good teacher at all) - in even throw-away lines for a _reason._ Many felt that he may have been lacking, so they make a point to address that in a reality they can shape themselves.\n\nIf more of the training was used to further flesh out the world instead of for points of conflicts like excitement, this likely wouldn\u2019t have happened. I mean, let\u2019s start with Wave - the first thing Kakashi presumably taught them is tree-walking - something that is clearly a control exercise, and something that is likely the basics for ninja to learn, and only after they are made to face the fact that they are not prepared for these circumstances. Kakashi hadn\u2019t been planning to teach them this very soon otherwise. What Sasuke and Naruto used to fight are not things they learned under Kakashi, either, but things they learned on their own, and decided on their own. \n\nHim teaching it is nothing special, and honestly feels like he should have been teaching them this earlier, especially when you remember that they only did the presumable \u201cnext step\u201d of this with water-walking months after having learned this, and Kakashi had declined teaching them most of them that himself. It was likely that Kishimoto only thought of this much later, but the fact still remains that Kakashi actively decided against teaching his own students that skill himself, and again, only brought it up to deal with a threat they hadn\u2019t been prepared to face reactively, rather than proactively. And it\u2019s also only assumed that all 3 learned this technique at all.",

                                            "body": "PART 2\n\nIn Naruto\u2019s case, he was very negligent and callous about it. He didn\u2019t tell Naruto that he wasn\u2019t gonna help him train for the Chunin Exams until the last minute, and he chose a teacher that actively does not like Naruto. He left Naruto high in dry in the most disrespectful way. He could have sought Naruto out himself and told him that he wasn\u2019t available to teach him but still give him tips and advice to help him train and succeed while he was gone. That would have taken, what, an extra 3 minutes? And if he was gonna chose a teacher for him, he should have chosen someone who wasn\u2019t gonna be a dick about it - Naruto has dealt with teachers and adults who have despised his very existence and was nearly murdered by one - why would you make Naruto rely on someone who dislikes him so obviously? \nNaruto appropriately ditched Ebisu before having found a teacher in Jiraiya. Kakashi made Naruto\u2019s learning Naruto\u2019s problem, which is completely inappropriate and clearly negligent. Kakashi acted as if he couldn\u2019t care about Naruto\u2019s education at all, and that it was a burden he happily tossed onto the first person he saw. He didn\u2019t have to act like that, but he did. He didn\u2019t need to teach Naruto, but he certainly should and could have been less flippant about not being there to help him, and about Naruto\u2019s own legitimate worries when Naruto rightly sought him out for guidance that he couldn\u2019t/wouldn\u2019t give. That\u2019s how Kishimoto wrote that scene, largely out of an attempt to make it humorous, but that\u2019s not how it was when you get to the barebones of it.\n\nAnd let\u2019s get into the Chuunin Exams - first of all, Kakashi knows damn well that inexperienced people can and will die, so why he didn\u2019t take preparing them a bit more seriously before then doesn\u2019t make sense. He had the opportunity to be more proactive, but he wasn\u2019t. He was at least reactive when it came to Zabuza, but why he couldn\u2019t have made sure they were more prepared by teaching at least something like the water walking _now_ doesn\u2019t add up right. He also didn\u2019t really tell them that people will attempt to murder them in this test and to prepare to fight against that - instead, they learned that from their own peers because Kishimoto wanted to make some Dramatic Tension, but he makes it so that Kakashi very much under prepares them in hindsight, and everything only ended up okay because of more Plot Armor than usual.\nAnother aspect of the Exams is how uncharacteristically unconcerned Kishimoto writes the authorities of Konoha to be. Orochimaru attacks, and you don\u2019t investigate more about what he did while he did so? You don\u2019t interrogate the people who faced him first hand, your own people who were made his victims? Really? I\u2019m pretty sure his henchmen were interrogated, but not at least checking in with the Konoha nin that fought them and encoring weed Orochimaru himself doesn\u2019t make much sense.\n\nHow did no one question how things went down in detail? If they did, Naruto would have said he was attacked by some strange technique that didn\u2019t seem to do anything - and he should have gotten a checkup to determine if that was really the case and then they would have figured out his chakra was sealed. The fact that Jiraiya only fixed that by chance makes all the authority around Naruto seem more negligent. Naruto would have mentioned Orochimaru attacking him, and they could have found the seal that way. Jiraiya only figured it out because Naruto was failing miserably with water walking, so he figured there was something wrong with his chakra. Ebisu wouldn\u2019t have thought something was wrong with Naruto\u2019s chakra, and would have just blamed it on Naruto not trying hard enough or being good enough or something. If Kakashi had been around to teach him himself, he would have realized something was wrong, and may have asked him to do something like tree-walk for a moment to see if it was maybe Naruto doing the practice wrong or something being wrong with him. \n\nNaruto was attacked, and no one did anything about it, and while he wasn\u2019t in pain or anything, he still had to deal with the consequences of such an attack longer than he had to - no one even stopped to think of something _could_ have been wrong with Naruto after having fought with Orochimaru. Being the Jinchuruuki should have made Konoha authorities more paranoid to make sure Orochimaru didn\u2019t do anything to him, because he\u2019s a person with interesting chakra and Orochimaru is the kind of person who would have been even vaguely interested in that. He wouldn\u2019t have made Naruto his body, but that doesn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t have done something to him, anyway. Check all your bases, damnit. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that Sasuke is made late to the Exams because of the Kakashi - stricter places would have rightfully disqualified them. It was an arrogant move used for a Dramatic entrance, and that\u2019s just not a good look. \n\nKakashi usually attempts to teach Team 7 something after a conflict, so why he didn\u2019t suggest teaching them something after the invasion is weird. Maybe teaching them more about genjutsu for when everyone was caught in it after the invasion? Teaching them a long distance attack? A new technique to handle something close range? Setting up training exercises with the other Konoha teams to foster togetherness and teamwork? Something. The way Naruto fought in the attack using tags was more likely something Naruto himself came up with, honestly, as he\u2019s set up traps for people before he even graduated - using tags to be more lethal is something he didn\u2019t need help coming up with.\n\nAnd I\u2019m focusing on Part 1 because that is the time where he was their primary guardian - he\u2019s in charge of their learning, and if he can\u2019t teach them something, he\u2019s to direct them to someone who can. He\u2019s there to make sure that they can use what they learned in the academy in the field, and to help them understand and learn that makes a ninja a ninja in practice, and not on paper. He is to guide them into being leaders themselves (becoming Chuunin and Jounin), and understanding where their specialties may lie and honing that. He doesn\u2019t seem to have done much toward that, mostly cultivating them mentally and less physically than he seemingly should have in hindsight. An example people like to point out for good reason is Sakura - she had been a blank slate that Kishimoto _constantly_ underutilized, and made it so that he learning only really kicked off after Part 1. Kakashi made a throw-away comment about her having good potential for genjutsu or something (during Wave or the first Bell Test), yet he\u2018s shown to not even put that idea into practice. The only thing he was shown to teach her was tree-walking - she didn\u2019t get far in the tournament, but he could have assigned her to do water-walking in the mean time but I don\u2019t think he did. Sakura has the most to learn from him, and for a man said to have a thousand jutsu, not teaching any of his students even one each is an utter waste.\n\nAnd when he _does_ teach Naruto in Shippuden, it\u2019s used as an exposition for the audience to explain chakra natures. The problem with that is that this is a lesson that is clearly a kind of basic understanding most Shinobi are _supposed_ to learn, and likely earlier than Naruto is now - once they begin seriously training and learning and mastering Jutsu, which Was a stage Naruto has been at years ago. Naruto is supposed to be strong enough to be a Chuunin, but he hadn\u2019t even learned this under years of attentive teaching with Jiraiya. He also likely would have learned this had he learned other Jutsu, but he doesn\u2019t.",

                                                    "body": "PART 3\n\nTLDR; \nThis is the kind of thing I mean - Kishimoto focuses Team 7ms learning for Exposition and Exciting Plot points that undermines the information that is actually conveyed. Kakashi is supposed to be a good and attentive teacher, but the opportunities that we had in canon to support that doesn\u2019t _actually_ support that. You instead have to more or less ignore the implications of what\u2019s actually written as onscreen support of and instead have to assume he was better offscreen. Kakashi as a teacher suffers as a character because Kishimoto did not properly support that aspect of him because he was focused on making things Interesting, not make his world building make sense. Kishimoto\u2019s world building takes a backseat a bit too often with how many things don\u2019t seem to make sense as they should. That\u2019s to be expected, but it tends to happen a bit too often and early in Naruto\u2019s writing, but it isn\u2019t well addressed even later. Kishimoto had a lot of great ideas, but his shoddy execution had the story suffer for it, and Kakashi as a teacher is just one of them. One of the main reasons his other manga he released a few years ago failed is because he kept rushing things without properly fleshing them out, and the story very much suffered for it. Kakashi is more a victim of Kishimoto not being nearly as good of a writer as the story needed him to be, and I stand by that idea very strongly.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m taking this too seriously, but I wanted to try to explain why \u201cKakashi is not as good of a teacher as he\u2019s supposed to be\u201d is something I very much transcribe to. I love Kakashi and I love his potential, and as much as I love the idea of him being a good teacher to Team 7, the reality of canon doesn\u2019t really support that. The only reason it stands as strong as it does is simply because he\u2019s constantly supposed to be read that way - \u201cbecause Kishimoto says so,\u201d not because the canon supports that. He\u2019s like Sakura - she has a lot of great potential and is definitely _supposed_ to be a very strong and formidable ninja in her own right, it\u2019s just that Kishimoto actively avoided displaying that in the canon under the excuse that he \u201ccan\u2019t write girls\u201d or something. It\u2019s why her best show of acting on that potential was during the last arc during a war, rather than during the times she _did_ fight fights that were rather lackluster and few incomparison to even more minor side characters. For a major character, he doesn\u2019t really treat her like one. She was more than a healer, and very capable in an outright fight. Kishimoto not putting effort into actually having Sakura put her money where her mouth is is why she\u2019s such a hated and \u201cuseless\u201d character.",

Had he been strong enough, he could've faced the Mist shinobi and saved Rin (though Rin had the 3 tails inside her, but that's a whole other debate). Had he been strong enough, he could've helped Minato a lot in his fight with Kyuubi (Even though Konoha forbid young shinobi to help, had Kakashi been strong enough, they would've allowed him because he was necessary). \n\nHe has *every* reason in the world to want to become stronger. He wouldn't get depressed because he was weak and couldn't save his friends, rather, he would take it as motivation and become stronger. That's just the kind of guy he is. Except, he didn't.

I mean, prior to Shippuden, look at how many people you could definitively say ranked higher than him: the Sannin (who are some of the most skilled ninja in the world even at the end of the series), the Third Hokage (a man whose literal title was \"the God of Shinobi\"), and Itachi (who was a prodigy among prodigies *and* had Sharinghax to boot). And speaking of Itachi, him and Kakashi are actually very similar - extremely skilled, but actually fairly weak, lacking the power to back it up. The difference is that Itachi had the Mangekyo to make up for that, which Kakashi couldn't properly use until it was far too late for it to make a meaningful difference.\n\nIt's the typical shounen problem where the gap between #1 and #5 is exponentially greater than the gap between #5 and #10, when in reality, the closer you get to the top, the smaller the differences really are. Kakashi is actually a really well rounded character in terms of combat capabilities - dangerous, skilled, and has a trump card or two, but has believable weaknesses to keep them in check. The problem is that most of the characters that were relevant by the end *weren't* balanced - this is evident from how Kakashi seemingly ignored the chakra and stamina issues that kept him from overusing the Chidori and spamming Kamui throughout most of the series with no explanation as to how that happened; throwing out that balance was necessary to even keep him in the battle without immediately biting it.",

Kakashi was a negligent teacher, acting more like a chaperone when that was only really appropriate in Shippuden. The only time he really took the time to teach them something was tree-walking, and only because they had to deal with more powerful people than they were equipped for. The fact that tree walking is just a control exercise (one every ninja likes _has_ to learn at some point) doesn\u2019t help. When Team 7 learned things, it was usually for some Exciting Plot point with other characters, not anything from Kakashi, and it ended up undermining what it must mean to be a ninja and Kakashi\u2019s own status as a teacher as a result.",

                            "body": "PART 1\n\nI think I stated elsewhere (I thought I said this in an earlier comment, but that must have been a different sub) that Kakashi at least helped them further what they already knew a bit, but didn\u2019t really teach beyond that. But again, that has to be the bear minimum, here. The problem with at least the other Teams is that they were clan children that were learning their clan techniques - they had less holes to fill than Kakashi could have, as he had orphans and a non clan child to teach. And I\u2019m just gonna focus more on Kakashi because we can follow his team and extrapolate the world from there, as that was also the intent of the writing to begin with.\n\nAnd as I stated before, the bulk of their learning was used for plot points that other people had a hand in, and it makes Kakashi\u2019s own onscreen and implied teachings look weak in comparison. Of course they learned offscreen, but what we saw onscreen showed a very disinterested Kakashi. Kishimoto did not well support the idea of Kakashi being a hands-on and attentive teacher, because that was _not_ what he displayed when he had the chance to do so. Having short montages of Kakashi correcting a stance as they spar, testing them like he did in the bell test, teaching them something new or making them learn it on their own would have done worlds of good at actually supporting the \u201cthey train offscreen, and he\u2019s also a good and attentive teacher\u201d idea, because the training we knew they\u2019d did, we knew Kakashi hadn\u2019t been a part of it. If your implied reality does not mesh with the concrete one that you made, that\u2019s not good writing and makes your own work a contradiction. Kakashi is a teacher who _presumably_ taught them and helped them hone their techniques, but the fact that I can\u2019t be confident in that with what we\u2019re given in canon means that that wasn\u2019t well written. People make a point to have Kakashi be a more attentive teacher (if he\u2019s made to be a good teacher at all) - in even throw-away lines for a _reason._ Many felt that he may have been lacking, so they make a point to address that in a reality they can shape themselves.\n\nIf more of the training was used to further flesh out the world instead of for points of conflicts like excitement, this likely wouldn\u2019t have happened. I mean, let\u2019s start with Wave - the first thing Kakashi presumably taught them is tree-walking - something that is clearly a control exercise, and something that is likely the basics for ninja to learn, and only after they are made to face the fact that they are not prepared for these circumstances. Kakashi hadn\u2019t been planning to teach them this very soon otherwise. What Sasuke and Naruto used to fight are not things they learned under Kakashi, either, but things they learned on their own, and decided on their own. \n\nHim teaching it is nothing special, and honestly feels like he should have been teaching them this earlier, especially when you remember that they only did the presumable \u201cnext step\u201d of this with water-walking months after having learned this, and Kakashi had declined teaching them most of them that himself. It was likely that Kishimoto only thought of this much later, but the fact still remains that Kakashi actively decided against teaching his own students that skill himself, and again, only brought it up to deal with a threat they hadn\u2019t been prepared to face reactively, rather than proactively. And it\u2019s also only assumed that all 3 learned this technique at all.",

                                    "body": "PART 2\n\nIn Naruto\u2019s case, he was very negligent and callous about it. He didn\u2019t tell Naruto that he wasn\u2019t gonna help him train for the Chunin Exams until the last minute, and he chose a teacher that actively does not like Naruto. He left Naruto high in dry in the most disrespectful way. He could have sought Naruto out himself and told him that he wasn\u2019t available to teach him but still give him tips and advice to help him train and succeed while he was gone. That would have taken, what, an extra 3 minutes? And if he was gonna chose a teacher for him, he should have chosen someone who wasn\u2019t gonna be a dick about it - Naruto has dealt with teachers and adults who have despised his very existence and was nearly murdered by one - why would you make Naruto rely on someone who dislikes him so obviously? \nNaruto appropriately ditched Ebisu before having found a teacher in Jiraiya. Kakashi made Naruto\u2019s learning Naruto\u2019s problem, which is completely inappropriate and clearly negligent. Kakashi acted as if he couldn\u2019t care about Naruto\u2019s education at all, and that it was a burden he happily tossed onto the first person he saw. He didn\u2019t have to act like that, but he did. He didn\u2019t need to teach Naruto, but he certainly should and could have been less flippant about not being there to help him, and about Naruto\u2019s own legitimate worries when Naruto rightly sought him out for guidance that he couldn\u2019t/wouldn\u2019t give. That\u2019s how Kishimoto wrote that scene, largely out of an attempt to make it humorous, but that\u2019s not how it was when you get to the barebones of it.\n\nAnd let\u2019s get into the Chuunin Exams - first of all, Kakashi knows damn well that inexperienced people can and will die, so why he didn\u2019t take preparing them a bit more seriously before then doesn\u2019t make sense. He had the opportunity to be more proactive, but he wasn\u2019t. He was at least reactive when it came to Zabuza, but why he couldn\u2019t have made sure they were more prepared by teaching at least something like the water walking _now_ doesn\u2019t add up right. He also didn\u2019t really tell them that people will attempt to murder them in this test and to prepare to fight against that - instead, they learned that from their own peers because Kishimoto wanted to make some Dramatic Tension, but he makes it so that Kakashi very much under prepares them in hindsight, and everything only ended up okay because of more Plot Armor than usual.\nAnother aspect of the Exams is how uncharacteristically unconcerned Kishimoto writes the authorities of Konoha to be. Orochimaru attacks, and you don\u2019t investigate more about what he did while he did so? You don\u2019t interrogate the people who faced him first hand, your own people who were made his victims? Really? I\u2019m pretty sure his henchmen were interrogated, but not at least checking in with the Konoha nin that fought them and encoring weed Orochimaru himself doesn\u2019t make much sense.\n\nHow did no one question how things went down in detail? If they did, Naruto would have said he was attacked by some strange technique that didn\u2019t seem to do anything - and he should have gotten a checkup to determine if that was really the case and then they would have figured out his chakra was sealed. The fact that Jiraiya only fixed that by chance makes all the authority around Naruto seem more negligent. Naruto would have mentioned Orochimaru attacking him, and they could have found the seal that way. Jiraiya only figured it out because Naruto was failing miserably with water walking, so he figured there was something wrong with his chakra. Ebisu wouldn\u2019t have thought something was wrong with Naruto\u2019s chakra, and would have just blamed it on Naruto not trying hard enough or being good enough or something. If Kakashi had been around to teach him himself, he would have realized something was wrong, and may have asked him to do something like tree-walk for a moment to see if it was maybe Naruto doing the practice wrong or something being wrong with him. \n\nNaruto was attacked, and no one did anything about it, and while he wasn\u2019t in pain or anything, he still had to deal with the consequences of such an attack longer than he had to - no one even stopped to think of something _could_ have been wrong with Naruto after having fought with Orochimaru. Being the Jinchuruuki should have made Konoha authorities more paranoid to make sure Orochimaru didn\u2019t do anything to him, because he\u2019s a person with interesting chakra and Orochimaru is the kind of person who would have been even vaguely interested in that. He wouldn\u2019t have made Naruto his body, but that doesn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t have done something to him, anyway. Check all your bases, damnit. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that Sasuke is made late to the Exams because of the Kakashi - stricter places would have rightfully disqualified them. It was an arrogant move used for a Dramatic entrance, and that\u2019s just not a good look. \n\nKakashi usually attempts to teach Team 7 something after a conflict, so why he didn\u2019t suggest teaching them something after the invasion is weird. Maybe teaching them more about genjutsu for when everyone was caught in it after the invasion? Teaching them a long distance attack? A new technique to handle something close range? Setting up training exercises with the other Konoha teams to foster togetherness and teamwork? Something. The way Naruto fought in the attack using tags was more likely something Naruto himself came up with, honestly, as he\u2019s set up traps for people before he even graduated - using tags to be more lethal is something he didn\u2019t need help coming up with.\n\nAnd I\u2019m focusing on Part 1 because that is the time where he was their primary guardian - he\u2019s in charge of their learning, and if he can\u2019t teach them something, he\u2019s to direct them to someone who can. He\u2019s there to make sure that they can use what they learned in the academy in the field, and to help them understand and learn that makes a ninja a ninja in practice, and not on paper. He is to guide them into being leaders themselves (becoming Chuunin and Jounin), and understanding where their specialties may lie and honing that. He doesn\u2019t seem to have done much toward that, mostly cultivating them mentally and less physically than he seemingly should have in hindsight. An example people like to point out for good reason is Sakura - she had been a blank slate that Kishimoto _constantly_ underutilized, and made it so that he learning only really kicked off after Part 1. Kakashi made a throw-away comment about her having good potential for genjutsu or something (during Wave or the first Bell Test), yet he\u2018s shown to not even put that idea into practice. The only thing he was shown to teach her was tree-walking - she didn\u2019t get far in the tournament, but he could have assigned her to do water-walking in the mean time but I don\u2019t think he did. Sakura has the most to learn from him, and for a man said to have a thousand jutsu, not teaching any of his students even one each is an utter waste.\n\nAnd when he _does_ teach Naruto in Shippuden, it\u2019s used as an exposition for the audience to explain chakra natures. The problem with that is that this is a lesson that is clearly a kind of basic understanding most Shinobi are _supposed_ to learn, and likely earlier than Naruto is now - once they begin seriously training and learning and mastering Jutsu, which Was a stage Naruto has been at years ago. Naruto is supposed to be strong enough to be a Chuunin, but he hadn\u2019t even learned this under years of attentive teaching with Jiraiya. He also likely would have learned this had he learned other Jutsu, but he doesn\u2019t.",

                                            "body": "PART 3\n\nTLDR; \nThis is the kind of thing I mean - Kishimoto focuses Team 7ms learning for Exposition and Exciting Plot points that undermines the information that is actually conveyed. Kakashi is supposed to be a good and attentive teacher, but the opportunities that we had in canon to support that doesn\u2019t _actually_ support that. You instead have to more or less ignore the implications of what\u2019s actually written as onscreen support of and instead have to assume he was better offscreen. Kakashi as a teacher suffers as a character because Kishimoto did not properly support that aspect of him because he was focused on making things Interesting, not make his world building make sense. Kishimoto\u2019s world building takes a backseat a bit too often with how many things don\u2019t seem to make sense as they should. That\u2019s to be expected, but it tends to happen a bit too often and early in Naruto\u2019s writing, but it isn\u2019t well addressed even later. Kishimoto had a lot of great ideas, but his shoddy execution had the story suffer for it, and Kakashi as a teacher is just one of them. One of the main reasons his other manga he released a few years ago failed is because he kept rushing things without properly fleshing them out, and the story very much suffered for it. Kakashi is more a victim of Kishimoto not being nearly as good of a writer as the story needed him to be, and I stand by that idea very strongly.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m taking this too seriously, but I wanted to try to explain why \u201cKakashi is not as good of a teacher as he\u2019s supposed to be\u201d is something I very much transcribe to. I love Kakashi and I love his potential, and as much as I love the idea of him being a good teacher to Team 7, the reality of canon doesn\u2019t really support that. The only reason it stands as strong as it does is simply because he\u2019s constantly supposed to be read that way - \u201cbecause Kishimoto says so,\u201d not because the canon supports that. He\u2019s like Sakura - she has a lot of great potential and is definitely _supposed_ to be a very strong and formidable ninja in her own right, it\u2019s just that Kishimoto actively avoided displaying that in the canon under the excuse that he \u201ccan\u2019t write girls\u201d or something. It\u2019s why her best show of acting on that potential was during the last arc during a war, rather than during the times she _did_ fight fights that were rather lackluster and few incomparison to even more minor side characters. For a major character, he doesn\u2019t really treat her like one. She was more than a healer, and very capable in an outright fight. Kishimoto not putting effort into actually having Sakura put her money where her mouth is is why she\u2019s such a hated and \u201cuseless\u201d character.",

And we can count on one hand the when we saw Kakashi make a point to teach his 3 students something at all, and most of them were before or during the Chunin Exam and only when their lives were in immediate danger - he didn\u2019t take the time to train them when it was peaceful, which is stupid. What about after? And why not more? Why not short, training montages of Kakashi having them spar and him Kakashi guiding them through techniques? Kakashi is shown time and time again to be instead _negligent_ and uninterested in furthering their skills. \nAnd Naruto learned Wind control under him in Shippuden, right? When he wasn\u2019t their primary teacher anymore? While Naruto was mastering a technique Kakashi had no hand in helping him learn? That really doesn\u2019t lend evidence to the fact that Kakashi was an excellent teacher, but more evidence how how could and otherwise would have been a better teacher if Kishimoto bothered to remember that he\u2019s a teacher at all. That instance was not a typical student-teacher relationship like they initially had, but more of something closer to equals, which is an interesting and cool aspect of their dynamic, but not one that shows off the teacher Kakashi _should_ have been, as Naruto was no longer his student. It was more like helping a coworker at your job with something they\u2019re inexperienced with, as Kakashi didn\u2019t really need to help Naruto here, and he wouldn\u2019t have been otherwise drafted for the help anyway. His help was a surprise, and not an expectation, and when his help _was_ an expectation, he didn\u2019t do anything.",

We basically saw like 2 weeks of it and even in that brief amount of time we saw him teach them something new.\n\n> he didn\u2019t take the time to train them when it was peaceful, which is stupid. \n\nHe did. Otherwise it makes no sense for Naruto and Sakura to become so much better while under him. \n\n>And Naruto learned Wind control under him in Shippuden, right? When he wasn\u2019t their primary teacher anymore?  \n\nThat doesn't really matter does it? Kakashi was teaching a genin Naruto who was under his supervision. And Naruto calls Kakashi sensei. I really don't know how they can be considered co-workers here.\n\nBesides that, how would you explain Naruto and Sakura's sudden growth if Kakashi was such a terrible teacher?\n\nOut of all the teams Kakashi's team went the furthest in the fighting competition part of the chunin exams. This was despite the fact they faced opponents who were better than them during the academy days.\n\n [These grades are from a data book.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NarutoFanfiction/comments/hr7w7g/narutos_and_his_classmates_academy_grades/fy2g5nf/?context=3) \n\nSo either Asuma and Kurenai were terrible teachers who somehow managed to weaken their students or Kakashi was a great teacher who was able to Improve his students skills to the point where they were able to fight opponents who were once stronger than them and win.\n\nAnd we obviously know that he taught Sasuke the chidori, which ended up being one of Sasuke's most resourceful jutsus. Probably only behind his Mangekyou hax abilities.",

Had he been strong enough, he could've faced the Mist shinobi and saved Rin (though Rin had the 3 tails inside her, but that's a whole other debate). Had he been strong enough, he could've helped Minato a lot in his fight with Kyuubi (Even though Konoha forbid young shinobi to help, had Kakashi been strong enough, they would've allowed him because he was necessary). \n\nHe has *every* reason in the world to want to become stronger. He wouldn't get depressed because he was weak and couldn't save his friends, rather, he would take it as motivation and become stronger. That's just the kind of guy he is. Except, he didn't. Like, for example, he lost a lot of loved ones and friends, that's why he cherished his bonds with Team-7 so much. The same should've applied to him becoming stronger",

It\u2019s just that that\u2019s the only time Kakashi showed so much interest and attentiveness to their development at all. I\u2019m not counting Kakashi helping Naruto in Shippuden because he wasn\u2019t Naruto\u2019s primary teacher anymore, and he only helped him refine a technique he already had, rather than teach him something completely new. Kakashi was a negligent teacher, acting more like a chaperone when that was only really appropriate in Shippuden. The only time he really took the time to teach them something was tree-walking, and only because they had to deal with more powerful people than they were equipped for. The fact that tree walking is just a control exercise (one every ninja likes _has_ to learn at some point) doesn\u2019t help. When Team 7 learned things, it was usually for some Exciting Plot point with other characters, not anything from Kakashi, and it ended up undermining what it must mean to be a ninja and Kakashi\u2019s own status as a teacher as a result.",

                    "body": "PART 1\n\nI think I stated elsewhere (I thought I said this in an earlier comment, but that must have been a different sub) that Kakashi at least helped them further what they already knew a bit, but didn\u2019t really teach beyond that. But again, that has to be the bear minimum, here. The problem with at least the other Teams is that they were clan children that were learning their clan techniques - they had less holes to fill than Kakashi could have, as he had orphans and a non clan child to teach. And I\u2019m just gonna focus more on Kakashi because we can follow his team and extrapolate the world from there, as that was also the intent of the writing to begin with.\n\nAnd as I stated before, the bulk of their learning was used for plot points that other people had a hand in, and it makes Kakashi\u2019s own onscreen and implied teachings look weak in comparison. Of course they learned offscreen, but what we saw onscreen showed a very disinterested Kakashi. Kishimoto did not well support the idea of Kakashi being a hands-on and attentive teacher, because that was _not_ what he displayed when he had the chance to do so. Having short montages of Kakashi correcting a stance as they spar, testing them like he did in the bell test, teaching them something new or making them learn it on their own would have done worlds of good at actually supporting the \u201cthey train offscreen, and he\u2019s also a good and attentive teacher\u201d idea, because the training we knew they\u2019d did, we knew Kakashi hadn\u2019t been a part of it. If your implied reality does not mesh with the concrete one that you made, that\u2019s not good writing and makes your own work a contradiction. Kakashi is a teacher who _presumably_ taught them and helped them hone their techniques, but the fact that I can\u2019t be confident in that with what we\u2019re given in canon means that that wasn\u2019t well written. People make a point to have Kakashi be a more attentive teacher (if he\u2019s made to be a good teacher at all) - in even throw-away lines for a _reason._ Many felt that he may have been lacking, so they make a point to address that in a reality they can shape themselves.\n\nIf more of the training was used to further flesh out the world instead of for points of conflicts like excitement, this likely wouldn\u2019t have happened. I mean, let\u2019s start with Wave - the first thing Kakashi presumably taught them is tree-walking - something that is clearly a control exercise, and something that is likely the basics for ninja to learn, and only after they are made to face the fact that they are not prepared for these circumstances. Kakashi hadn\u2019t been planning to teach them this very soon otherwise. What Sasuke and Naruto used to fight are not things they learned under Kakashi, either, but things they learned on their own, and decided on their own. \n\nHim teaching it is nothing special, and honestly feels like he should have been teaching them this earlier, especially when you remember that they only did the presumable \u201cnext step\u201d of this with water-walking months after having learned this, and Kakashi had declined teaching them most of them that himself. It was likely that Kishimoto only thought of this much later, but the fact still remains that Kakashi actively decided against teaching his own students that skill himself, and again, only brought it up to deal with a threat they hadn\u2019t been prepared to face reactively, rather than proactively. And it\u2019s also only assumed that all 3 learned this technique at all.",

                            "body": "PART 2\n\nIn Naruto\u2019s case, he was very negligent and callous about it. He didn\u2019t tell Naruto that he wasn\u2019t gonna help him train for the Chunin Exams until the last minute, and he chose a teacher that actively does not like Naruto. He left Naruto high in dry in the most disrespectful way. He could have sought Naruto out himself and told him that he wasn\u2019t available to teach him but still give him tips and advice to help him train and succeed while he was gone. That would have taken, what, an extra 3 minutes? And if he was gonna chose a teacher for him, he should have chosen someone who wasn\u2019t gonna be a dick about it - Naruto has dealt with teachers and adults who have despised his very existence and was nearly murdered by one - why would you make Naruto rely on someone who dislikes him so obviously? \nNaruto appropriately ditched Ebisu before having found a teacher in Jiraiya. Kakashi made Naruto\u2019s learning Naruto\u2019s problem, which is completely inappropriate and clearly negligent. Kakashi acted as if he couldn\u2019t care about Naruto\u2019s education at all, and that it was a burden he happily tossed onto the first person he saw. He didn\u2019t have to act like that, but he did. He didn\u2019t need to teach Naruto, but he certainly should and could have been less flippant about not being there to help him, and about Naruto\u2019s own legitimate worries when Naruto rightly sought him out for guidance that he couldn\u2019t/wouldn\u2019t give. That\u2019s how Kishimoto wrote that scene, largely out of an attempt to make it humorous, but that\u2019s not how it was when you get to the barebones of it.\n\nAnd let\u2019s get into the Chuunin Exams - first of all, Kakashi knows damn well that inexperienced people can and will die, so why he didn\u2019t take preparing them a bit more seriously before then doesn\u2019t make sense. He had the opportunity to be more proactive, but he wasn\u2019t. He was at least reactive when it came to Zabuza, but why he couldn\u2019t have made sure they were more prepared by teaching at least something like the water walking _now_ doesn\u2019t add up right. He also didn\u2019t really tell them that people will attempt to murder them in this test and to prepare to fight against that - instead, they learned that from their own peers because Kishimoto wanted to make some Dramatic Tension, but he makes it so that Kakashi very much under prepares them in hindsight, and everything only ended up okay because of more Plot Armor than usual.\nAnother aspect of the Exams is how uncharacteristically unconcerned Kishimoto writes the authorities of Konoha to be. Orochimaru attacks, and you don\u2019t investigate more about what he did while he did so? You don\u2019t interrogate the people who faced him first hand, your own people who were made his victims? Really? I\u2019m pretty sure his henchmen were interrogated, but not at least checking in with the Konoha nin that fought them and encoring weed Orochimaru himself doesn\u2019t make much sense.\n\nHow did no one question how things went down in detail? If they did, Naruto would have said he was attacked by some strange technique that didn\u2019t seem to do anything - and he should have gotten a checkup to determine if that was really the case and then they would have figured out his chakra was sealed. The fact that Jiraiya only fixed that by chance makes all the authority around Naruto seem more negligent. Naruto would have mentioned Orochimaru attacking him, and they could have found the seal that way. Jiraiya only figured it out because Naruto was failing miserably with water walking, so he figured there was something wrong with his chakra. Ebisu wouldn\u2019t have thought something was wrong with Naruto\u2019s chakra, and would have just blamed it on Naruto not trying hard enough or being good enough or something. If Kakashi had been around to teach him himself, he would have realized something was wrong, and may have asked him to do something like tree-walk for a moment to see if it was maybe Naruto doing the practice wrong or something being wrong with him. \n\nNaruto was attacked, and no one did anything about it, and while he wasn\u2019t in pain or anything, he still had to deal with the consequences of such an attack longer than he had to - no one even stopped to think of something _could_ have been wrong with Naruto after having fought with Orochimaru. Being the Jinchuruuki should have made Konoha authorities more paranoid to make sure Orochimaru didn\u2019t do anything to him, because he\u2019s a person with interesting chakra and Orochimaru is the kind of person who would have been even vaguely interested in that. He wouldn\u2019t have made Naruto his body, but that doesn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t have done something to him, anyway. Check all your bases, damnit. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that Sasuke is made late to the Exams because of the Kakashi - stricter places would have rightfully disqualified them. It was an arrogant move used for a Dramatic entrance, and that\u2019s just not a good look. \n\nKakashi usually attempts to teach Team 7 something after a conflict, so why he didn\u2019t suggest teaching them something after the invasion is weird. Maybe teaching them more about genjutsu for when everyone was caught in it after the invasion? Teaching them a long distance attack? A new technique to handle something close range? Setting up training exercises with the other Konoha teams to foster togetherness and teamwork? Something. The way Naruto fought in the attack using tags was more likely something Naruto himself came up with, honestly, as he\u2019s set up traps for people before he even graduated - using tags to be more lethal is something he didn\u2019t need help coming up with.\n\nAnd I\u2019m focusing on Part 1 because that is the time where he was their primary guardian - he\u2019s in charge of their learning, and if he can\u2019t teach them something, he\u2019s to direct them to someone who can. He\u2019s there to make sure that they can use what they learned in the academy in the field, and to help them understand and learn that makes a ninja a ninja in practice, and not on paper. He is to guide them into being leaders themselves (becoming Chuunin and Jounin), and understanding where their specialties may lie and honing that. He doesn\u2019t seem to have done much toward that, mostly cultivating them mentally and less physically than he seemingly should have in hindsight. An example people like to point out for good reason is Sakura - she had been a blank slate that Kishimoto _constantly_ underutilized, and made it so that he learning only really kicked off after Part 1. Kakashi made a throw-away comment about her having good potential for genjutsu or something (during Wave or the first Bell Test), yet he\u2018s shown to not even put that idea into practice. The only thing he was shown to teach her was tree-walking - she didn\u2019t get far in the tournament, but he could have assigned her to do water-walking in the mean time but I don\u2019t think he did. Sakura has the most to learn from him, and for a man said to have a thousand jutsu, not teaching any of his students even one each is an utter waste.\n\nAnd when he _does_ teach Naruto in Shippuden, it\u2019s used as an exposition for the audience to explain chakra natures. The problem with that is that this is a lesson that is clearly a kind of basic understanding most Shinobi are _supposed_ to learn, and likely earlier than Naruto is now - once they begin seriously training and learning and mastering Jutsu, which Was a stage Naruto has been at years ago. Naruto is supposed to be strong enough to be a Chuunin, but he hadn\u2019t even learned this under years of attentive teaching with Jiraiya. He also likely would have learned this had he learned other Jutsu, but he doesn\u2019t.",

                                    "body": "PART 3\n\nTLDR; \nThis is the kind of thing I mean - Kishimoto focuses Team 7ms learning for Exposition and Exciting Plot points that undermines the information that is actually conveyed. Kakashi is supposed to be a good and attentive teacher, but the opportunities that we had in canon to support that doesn\u2019t _actually_ support that. You instead have to more or less ignore the implications of what\u2019s actually written as onscreen support of and instead have to assume he was better offscreen. Kakashi as a teacher suffers as a character because Kishimoto did not properly support that aspect of him because he was focused on making things Interesting, not make his world building make sense. Kishimoto\u2019s world building takes a backseat a bit too often with how many things don\u2019t seem to make sense as they should. That\u2019s to be expected, but it tends to happen a bit too often and early in Naruto\u2019s writing, but it isn\u2019t well addressed even later. Kishimoto had a lot of great ideas, but his shoddy execution had the story suffer for it, and Kakashi as a teacher is just one of them. One of the main reasons his other manga he released a few years ago failed is because he kept rushing things without properly fleshing them out, and the story very much suffered for it. Kakashi is more a victim of Kishimoto not being nearly as good of a writer as the story needed him to be, and I stand by that idea very strongly.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m taking this too seriously, but I wanted to try to explain why \u201cKakashi is not as good of a teacher as he\u2019s supposed to be\u201d is something I very much transcribe to. I love Kakashi and I love his potential, and as much as I love the idea of him being a good teacher to Team 7, the reality of canon doesn\u2019t really support that. The only reason it stands as strong as it does is simply because he\u2019s constantly supposed to be read that way - \u201cbecause Kishimoto says so,\u201d not because the canon supports that. He\u2019s like Sakura - she has a lot of great potential and is definitely _supposed_ to be a very strong and formidable ninja in her own right, it\u2019s just that Kishimoto actively avoided displaying that in the canon under the excuse that he \u201ccan\u2019t write girls\u201d or something. It\u2019s why her best show of acting on that potential was during the last arc during a war, rather than during the times she _did_ fight fights that were rather lackluster and few incomparison to even more minor side characters. For a major character, he doesn\u2019t really treat her like one. She was more than a healer, and very capable in an outright fight. Kishimoto not putting effort into actually having Sakura put her money where her mouth is is why she\u2019s such a hated and \u201cuseless\u201d character.",

It was more like helping a coworker at your job with something they\u2019re inexperienced with, as Kakashi didn\u2019t really need to help Naruto here, and he wouldn\u2019t have been otherwise drafted for the help anyway.

            "body": "PART 1\n\nI think I stated elsewhere (I thought I said this in an earlier comment, but that must have been a different sub) that Kakashi at least helped them further what they already knew a bit, but didn\u2019t really teach beyond that. But again, that has to be the bear minimum, here. The problem with at least the other Teams is that they were clan children that were learning their clan techniques - they had less holes to fill than Kakashi could have, as he had orphans and a non clan child to teach. And I\u2019m just gonna focus more on Kakashi because we can follow his team and extrapolate the world from there, as that was also the intent of the writing to begin with.\n\nAnd as I stated before, the bulk of their learning was used for plot points that other people had a hand in, and it makes Kakashi\u2019s own onscreen and implied teachings look weak in comparison. Of course they learned offscreen, but what we saw onscreen showed a very disinterested Kakashi. Kishimoto did not well support the idea of Kakashi being a hands-on and attentive teacher, because that was _not_ what he displayed when he had the chance to do so. Having short montages of Kakashi correcting a stance as they spar, testing them like he did in the bell test, teaching them something new or making them learn it on their own would have done worlds of good at actually supporting the \u201cthey train offscreen, and he\u2019s also a good and attentive teacher\u201d idea, because the training we knew they\u2019d did, we knew Kakashi hadn\u2019t been a part of it. If your implied reality does not mesh with the concrete one that you made, that\u2019s not good writing and makes your own work a contradiction. Kakashi is a teacher who _presumably_ taught them and helped them hone their techniques, but the fact that I can\u2019t be confident in that with what we\u2019re given in canon means that that wasn\u2019t well written. People make a point to have Kakashi be a more attentive teacher (if he\u2019s made to be a good teacher at all) - in even throw-away lines for a _reason._ Many felt that he may have been lacking, so they make a point to address that in a reality they can shape themselves.\n\nIf more of the training was used to further flesh out the world instead of for points of conflicts like excitement, this likely wouldn\u2019t have happened. I mean, let\u2019s start with Wave - the first thing Kakashi presumably taught them is tree-walking - something that is clearly a control exercise, and something that is likely the basics for ninja to learn, and only after they are made to face the fact that they are not prepared for these circumstances. Kakashi hadn\u2019t been planning to teach them this very soon otherwise. What Sasuke and Naruto used to fight are not things they learned under Kakashi, either, but things they learned on their own, and decided on their own. \n\nHim teaching it is nothing special, and honestly feels like he should have been teaching them this earlier, especially when you remember that they only did the presumable \u201cnext step\u201d of this with water-walking months after having learned this, and Kakashi had declined teaching them most of them that himself. It was likely that Kishimoto only thought of this much later, but the fact still remains that Kakashi actively decided against teaching his own students that skill himself, and again, only brought it up to deal with a threat they hadn\u2019t been prepared to face reactively, rather than proactively. And it\u2019s also only assumed that all 3 learned this technique at all.",

                    "body": "PART 2\n\nIn Naruto\u2019s case, he was very negligent and callous about it. He didn\u2019t tell Naruto that he wasn\u2019t gonna help him train for the Chunin Exams until the last minute, and he chose a teacher that actively does not like Naruto. He left Naruto high in dry in the most disrespectful way. He could have sought Naruto out himself and told him that he wasn\u2019t available to teach him but still give him tips and advice to help him train and succeed while he was gone. That would have taken, what, an extra 3 minutes? And if he was gonna chose a teacher for him, he should have chosen someone who wasn\u2019t gonna be a dick about it - Naruto has dealt with teachers and adults who have despised his very existence and was nearly murdered by one - why would you make Naruto rely on someone who dislikes him so obviously? \nNaruto appropriately ditched Ebisu before having found a teacher in Jiraiya. Kakashi made Naruto\u2019s learning Naruto\u2019s problem, which is completely inappropriate and clearly negligent. Kakashi acted as if he couldn\u2019t care about Naruto\u2019s education at all, and that it was a burden he happily tossed onto the first person he saw. He didn\u2019t have to act like that, but he did. He didn\u2019t need to teach Naruto, but he certainly should and could have been less flippant about not being there to help him, and about Naruto\u2019s own legitimate worries when Naruto rightly sought him out for guidance that he couldn\u2019t/wouldn\u2019t give. That\u2019s how Kishimoto wrote that scene, largely out of an attempt to make it humorous, but that\u2019s not how it was when you get to the barebones of it.\n\nAnd let\u2019s get into the Chuunin Exams - first of all, Kakashi knows damn well that inexperienced people can and will die, so why he didn\u2019t take preparing them a bit more seriously before then doesn\u2019t make sense. He had the opportunity to be more proactive, but he wasn\u2019t. He was at least reactive when it came to Zabuza, but why he couldn\u2019t have made sure they were more prepared by teaching at least something like the water walking _now_ doesn\u2019t add up right. He also didn\u2019t really tell them that people will attempt to murder them in this test and to prepare to fight against that - instead, they learned that from their own peers because Kishimoto wanted to make some Dramatic Tension, but he makes it so that Kakashi very much under prepares them in hindsight, and everything only ended up okay because of more Plot Armor than usual.\nAnother aspect of the Exams is how uncharacteristically unconcerned Kishimoto writes the authorities of Konoha to be. Orochimaru attacks, and you don\u2019t investigate more about what he did while he did so? You don\u2019t interrogate the people who faced him first hand, your own people who were made his victims? Really? I\u2019m pretty sure his henchmen were interrogated, but not at least checking in with the Konoha nin that fought them and encoring weed Orochimaru himself doesn\u2019t make much sense.\n\nHow did no one question how things went down in detail? If they did, Naruto would have said he was attacked by some strange technique that didn\u2019t seem to do anything - and he should have gotten a checkup to determine if that was really the case and then they would have figured out his chakra was sealed. The fact that Jiraiya only fixed that by chance makes all the authority around Naruto seem more negligent. Naruto would have mentioned Orochimaru attacking him, and they could have found the seal that way. Jiraiya only figured it out because Naruto was failing miserably with water walking, so he figured there was something wrong with his chakra. Ebisu wouldn\u2019t have thought something was wrong with Naruto\u2019s chakra, and would have just blamed it on Naruto not trying hard enough or being good enough or something. If Kakashi had been around to teach him himself, he would have realized something was wrong, and may have asked him to do something like tree-walk for a moment to see if it was maybe Naruto doing the practice wrong or something being wrong with him. \n\nNaruto was attacked, and no one did anything about it, and while he wasn\u2019t in pain or anything, he still had to deal with the consequences of such an attack longer than he had to - no one even stopped to think of something _could_ have been wrong with Naruto after having fought with Orochimaru. Being the Jinchuruuki should have made Konoha authorities more paranoid to make sure Orochimaru didn\u2019t do anything to him, because he\u2019s a person with interesting chakra and Orochimaru is the kind of person who would have been even vaguely interested in that. He wouldn\u2019t have made Naruto his body, but that doesn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t have done something to him, anyway. Check all your bases, damnit. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that Sasuke is made late to the Exams because of the Kakashi - stricter places would have rightfully disqualified them. It was an arrogant move used for a Dramatic entrance, and that\u2019s just not a good look. \n\nKakashi usually attempts to teach Team 7 something after a conflict, so why he didn\u2019t suggest teaching them something after the invasion is weird. Maybe teaching them more about genjutsu for when everyone was caught in it after the invasion? Teaching them a long distance attack? A new technique to handle something close range? Setting up training exercises with the other Konoha teams to foster togetherness and teamwork? Something. The way Naruto fought in the attack using tags was more likely something Naruto himself came up with, honestly, as he\u2019s set up traps for people before he even graduated - using tags to be more lethal is something he didn\u2019t need help coming up with.\n\nAnd I\u2019m focusing on Part 1 because that is the time where he was their primary guardian - he\u2019s in charge of their learning, and if he can\u2019t teach them something, he\u2019s to direct them to someone who can. He\u2019s there to make sure that they can use what they learned in the academy in the field, and to help them understand and learn that makes a ninja a ninja in practice, and not on paper. He is to guide them into being leaders themselves (becoming Chuunin and Jounin), and understanding where their specialties may lie and honing that. He doesn\u2019t seem to have done much toward that, mostly cultivating them mentally and less physically than he seemingly should have in hindsight. An example people like to point out for good reason is Sakura - she had been a blank slate that Kishimoto _constantly_ underutilized, and made it so that he learning only really kicked off after Part 1. Kakashi made a throw-away comment about her having good potential for genjutsu or something (during Wave or the first Bell Test), yet he\u2018s shown to not even put that idea into practice. The only thing he was shown to teach her was tree-walking - she didn\u2019t get far in the tournament, but he could have assigned her to do water-walking in the mean time but I don\u2019t think he did. Sakura has the most to learn from him, and for a man said to have a thousand jutsu, not teaching any of his students even one each is an utter waste.\n\nAnd when he _does_ teach Naruto in Shippuden, it\u2019s used as an exposition for the audience to explain chakra natures. The problem with that is that this is a lesson that is clearly a kind of basic understanding most Shinobi are _supposed_ to learn, and likely earlier than Naruto is now - once they begin seriously training and learning and mastering Jutsu, which Was a stage Naruto has been at years ago. Naruto is supposed to be strong enough to be a Chuunin, but he hadn\u2019t even learned this under years of attentive teaching with Jiraiya. He also likely would have learned this had he learned other Jutsu, but he doesn\u2019t.",

                            "body": "PART 3\n\nTLDR; \nThis is the kind of thing I mean - Kishimoto focuses Team 7ms learning for Exposition and Exciting Plot points that undermines the information that is actually conveyed. Kakashi is supposed to be a good and attentive teacher, but the opportunities that we had in canon to support that doesn\u2019t _actually_ support that. You instead have to more or less ignore the implications of what\u2019s actually written as onscreen support of and instead have to assume he was better offscreen. Kakashi as a teacher suffers as a character because Kishimoto did not properly support that aspect of him because he was focused on making things Interesting, not make his world building make sense. Kishimoto\u2019s world building takes a backseat a bit too often with how many things don\u2019t seem to make sense as they should. That\u2019s to be expected, but it tends to happen a bit too often and early in Naruto\u2019s writing, but it isn\u2019t well addressed even later. Kishimoto had a lot of great ideas, but his shoddy execution had the story suffer for it, and Kakashi as a teacher is just one of them. One of the main reasons his other manga he released a few years ago failed is because he kept rushing things without properly fleshing them out, and the story very much suffered for it. Kakashi is more a victim of Kishimoto not being nearly as good of a writer as the story needed him to be, and I stand by that idea very strongly.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m taking this too seriously, but I wanted to try to explain why \u201cKakashi is not as good of a teacher as he\u2019s supposed to be\u201d is something I very much transcribe to. I love Kakashi and I love his potential, and as much as I love the idea of him being a good teacher to Team 7, the reality of canon doesn\u2019t really support that. The only reason it stands as strong as it does is simply because he\u2019s constantly supposed to be read that way - \u201cbecause Kishimoto says so,\u201d not because the canon supports that. He\u2019s like Sakura - she has a lot of great potential and is definitely _supposed_ to be a very strong and formidable ninja in her own right, it\u2019s just that Kishimoto actively avoided displaying that in the canon under the excuse that he \u201ccan\u2019t write girls\u201d or something. It\u2019s why her best show of acting on that potential was during the last arc during a war, rather than during the times she _did_ fight fights that were rather lackluster and few incomparison to even more minor side characters. For a major character, he doesn\u2019t really treat her like one. She was more than a healer, and very capable in an outright fight. Kishimoto not putting effort into actually having Sakura put her money where her mouth is is why she\u2019s such a hated and \u201cuseless\u201d character.",

What about after? And why not more? Why not short, training montages of Kakashi having them spar and him Kakashi guiding them through techniques?

When he wasn\u2019t their primary teacher anymore? While Naruto was mastering a technique Kakashi had no hand in helping him learn? That really doesn\u2019t lend evidence to the fact that Kakashi was an excellent teacher, but more evidence how how could and otherwise would have been a better teacher if Kishimoto bothered to remember that he\u2019s a teacher at all. That instance was not a typical student-teacher relationship like they initially had, but more of something closer to equals, which is an interesting and cool aspect of their dynamic, but not one that shows off the teacher Kakashi _should_ have been, as Naruto was no longer his student. It was more like helping a coworker at your job with something they\u2019re inexperienced with, as Kakashi didn\u2019t really need to help Naruto here, and he wouldn\u2019t have been otherwise drafted for the help anyway.

                            "body": "> And we can count on one hand the when we saw Kakashi make a point to teach his 3 students something at all\n\nI mean, how much of the time they were under him was actually shown in the manga? We basically saw like 2 weeks of it and even in that brief amount of time we saw him teach them something new.\n\n> he didn\u2019t take the time to train them when it was peaceful, which is stupid. \n\nHe did. Otherwise it makes no sense for Naruto and Sakura to become so much better while under him. \n\n>And Naruto learned Wind control under him in Shippuden, right? When he wasn\u2019t their primary teacher anymore?  \n\nThat doesn't really matter does it? Kakashi was teaching a genin Naruto who was under his supervision. And Naruto calls Kakashi sensei. I really don't know how they can be considered co-workers here.\n\nBesides that, how would you explain Naruto and Sakura's sudden growth if Kakashi was such a terrible teacher?\n\nOut of all the teams Kakashi's team went the furthest in the fighting competition part of the chunin exams. This was despite the fact they faced opponents who were better than them during the academy days.\n\n [These grades are from a data book.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NarutoFanfiction/comments/hr7w7g/narutos_and_his_classmates_academy_grades/fy2g5nf/?context=3) \n\nSo either Asuma and Kurenai were terrible teachers who somehow managed to weaken their students or Kakashi was a great teacher who was able to Improve his students skills to the point where they were able to fight opponents who were once stronger than them and win.\n\nAnd we obviously know that he taught Sasuke the chidori, which ended up being one of Sasuke's most resourceful jutsus. Probably only behind his Mangekyou hax abilities.",

            "body": "PART 2\n\nIn Naruto\u2019s case, he was very negligent and callous about it. He didn\u2019t tell Naruto that he wasn\u2019t gonna help him train for the Chunin Exams until the last minute, and he chose a teacher that actively does not like Naruto. He left Naruto high in dry in the most disrespectful way. He could have sought Naruto out himself and told him that he wasn\u2019t available to teach him but still give him tips and advice to help him train and succeed while he was gone. That would have taken, what, an extra 3 minutes? And if he was gonna chose a teacher for him, he should have chosen someone who wasn\u2019t gonna be a dick about it - Naruto has dealt with teachers and adults who have despised his very existence and was nearly murdered by one - why would you make Naruto rely on someone who dislikes him so obviously? \nNaruto appropriately ditched Ebisu before having found a teacher in Jiraiya. Kakashi made Naruto\u2019s learning Naruto\u2019s problem, which is completely inappropriate and clearly negligent. Kakashi acted as if he couldn\u2019t care about Naruto\u2019s education at all, and that it was a burden he happily tossed onto the first person he saw. He didn\u2019t have to act like that, but he did. He didn\u2019t need to teach Naruto, but he certainly should and could have been less flippant about not being there to help him, and about Naruto\u2019s own legitimate worries when Naruto rightly sought him out for guidance that he couldn\u2019t/wouldn\u2019t give. That\u2019s how Kishimoto wrote that scene, largely out of an attempt to make it humorous, but that\u2019s not how it was when you get to the barebones of it.\n\nAnd let\u2019s get into the Chuunin Exams - first of all, Kakashi knows damn well that inexperienced people can and will die, so why he didn\u2019t take preparing them a bit more seriously before then doesn\u2019t make sense. He had the opportunity to be more proactive, but he wasn\u2019t. He was at least reactive when it came to Zabuza, but why he couldn\u2019t have made sure they were more prepared by teaching at least something like the water walking _now_ doesn\u2019t add up right. He also didn\u2019t really tell them that people will attempt to murder them in this test and to prepare to fight against that - instead, they learned that from their own peers because Kishimoto wanted to make some Dramatic Tension, but he makes it so that Kakashi very much under prepares them in hindsight, and everything only ended up okay because of more Plot Armor than usual.\nAnother aspect of the Exams is how uncharacteristically unconcerned Kishimoto writes the authorities of Konoha to be. Orochimaru attacks, and you don\u2019t investigate more about what he did while he did so? You don\u2019t interrogate the people who faced him first hand, your own people who were made his victims? Really? I\u2019m pretty sure his henchmen were interrogated, but not at least checking in with the Konoha nin that fought them and encoring weed Orochimaru himself doesn\u2019t make much sense.\n\nHow did no one question how things went down in detail? If they did, Naruto would have said he was attacked by some strange technique that didn\u2019t seem to do anything - and he should have gotten a checkup to determine if that was really the case and then they would have figured out his chakra was sealed. The fact that Jiraiya only fixed that by chance makes all the authority around Naruto seem more negligent. Naruto would have mentioned Orochimaru attacking him, and they could have found the seal that way. Jiraiya only figured it out because Naruto was failing miserably with water walking, so he figured there was something wrong with his chakra. Ebisu wouldn\u2019t have thought something was wrong with Naruto\u2019s chakra, and would have just blamed it on Naruto not trying hard enough or being good enough or something. If Kakashi had been around to teach him himself, he would have realized something was wrong, and may have asked him to do something like tree-walk for a moment to see if it was maybe Naruto doing the practice wrong or something being wrong with him. \n\nNaruto was attacked, and no one did anything about it, and while he wasn\u2019t in pain or anything, he still had to deal with the consequences of such an attack longer than he had to - no one even stopped to think of something _could_ have been wrong with Naruto after having fought with Orochimaru. Being the Jinchuruuki should have made Konoha authorities more paranoid to make sure Orochimaru didn\u2019t do anything to him, because he\u2019s a person with interesting chakra and Orochimaru is the kind of person who would have been even vaguely interested in that. He wouldn\u2019t have made Naruto his body, but that doesn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t have done something to him, anyway. Check all your bases, damnit. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that Sasuke is made late to the Exams because of the Kakashi - stricter places would have rightfully disqualified them. It was an arrogant move used for a Dramatic entrance, and that\u2019s just not a good look. \n\nKakashi usually attempts to teach Team 7 something after a conflict, so why he didn\u2019t suggest teaching them something after the invasion is weird. Maybe teaching them more about genjutsu for when everyone was caught in it after the invasion? Teaching them a long distance attack? A new technique to handle something close range? Setting up training exercises with the other Konoha teams to foster togetherness and teamwork? Something. The way Naruto fought in the attack using tags was more likely something Naruto himself came up with, honestly, as he\u2019s set up traps for people before he even graduated - using tags to be more lethal is something he didn\u2019t need help coming up with.\n\nAnd I\u2019m focusing on Part 1 because that is the time where he was their primary guardian - he\u2019s in charge of their learning, and if he can\u2019t teach them something, he\u2019s to direct them to someone who can. He\u2019s there to make sure that they can use what they learned in the academy in the field, and to help them understand and learn that makes a ninja a ninja in practice, and not on paper. He is to guide them into being leaders themselves (becoming Chuunin and Jounin), and understanding where their specialties may lie and honing that. He doesn\u2019t seem to have done much toward that, mostly cultivating them mentally and less physically than he seemingly should have in hindsight. An example people like to point out for good reason is Sakura - she had been a blank slate that Kishimoto _constantly_ underutilized, and made it so that he learning only really kicked off after Part 1. Kakashi made a throw-away comment about her having good potential for genjutsu or something (during Wave or the first Bell Test), yet he\u2018s shown to not even put that idea into practice. The only thing he was shown to teach her was tree-walking - she didn\u2019t get far in the tournament, but he could have assigned her to do water-walking in the mean time but I don\u2019t think he did. Sakura has the most to learn from him, and for a man said to have a thousand jutsu, not teaching any of his students even one each is an utter waste.\n\nAnd when he _does_ teach Naruto in Shippuden, it\u2019s used as an exposition for the audience to explain chakra natures. The problem with that is that this is a lesson that is clearly a kind of basic understanding most Shinobi are _supposed_ to learn, and likely earlier than Naruto is now - once they begin seriously training and learning and mastering Jutsu, which Was a stage Naruto has been at years ago. Naruto is supposed to be strong enough to be a Chuunin, but he hadn\u2019t even learned this under years of attentive teaching with Jiraiya. He also likely would have learned this had he learned other Jutsu, but he doesn\u2019t.",

                    "body": "PART 3\n\nTLDR; \nThis is the kind of thing I mean - Kishimoto focuses Team 7ms learning for Exposition and Exciting Plot points that undermines the information that is actually conveyed. Kakashi is supposed to be a good and attentive teacher, but the opportunities that we had in canon to support that doesn\u2019t _actually_ support that. You instead have to more or less ignore the implications of what\u2019s actually written as onscreen support of and instead have to assume he was better offscreen. Kakashi as a teacher suffers as a character because Kishimoto did not properly support that aspect of him because he was focused on making things Interesting, not make his world building make sense. Kishimoto\u2019s world building takes a backseat a bit too often with how many things don\u2019t seem to make sense as they should. That\u2019s to be expected, but it tends to happen a bit too often and early in Naruto\u2019s writing, but it isn\u2019t well addressed even later. Kishimoto had a lot of great ideas, but his shoddy execution had the story suffer for it, and Kakashi as a teacher is just one of them. One of the main reasons his other manga he released a few years ago failed is because he kept rushing things without properly fleshing them out, and the story very much suffered for it. Kakashi is more a victim of Kishimoto not being nearly as good of a writer as the story needed him to be, and I stand by that idea very strongly.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m taking this too seriously, but I wanted to try to explain why \u201cKakashi is not as good of a teacher as he\u2019s supposed to be\u201d is something I very much transcribe to. I love Kakashi and I love his potential, and as much as I love the idea of him being a good teacher to Team 7, the reality of canon doesn\u2019t really support that. The only reason it stands as strong as it does is simply because he\u2019s constantly supposed to be read that way - \u201cbecause Kishimoto says so,\u201d not because the canon supports that. He\u2019s like Sakura - she has a lot of great potential and is definitely _supposed_ to be a very strong and formidable ninja in her own right, it\u2019s just that Kishimoto actively avoided displaying that in the canon under the excuse that he \u201ccan\u2019t write girls\u201d or something. It\u2019s why her best show of acting on that potential was during the last arc during a war, rather than during the times she _did_ fight fights that were rather lackluster and few incomparison to even more minor side characters. For a major character, he doesn\u2019t really treat her like one. She was more than a healer, and very capable in an outright fight. Kishimoto not putting effort into actually having Sakura put her money where her mouth is is why she\u2019s such a hated and \u201cuseless\u201d character.",

And we can count on one hand the when we saw Kakashi make a point to teach his 3 students something at all, and most of them were before or during the Chunin Exam and only when their lives were in immediate danger - he didn\u2019t take the time to train them when it was peaceful, which is stupid. What about after? And why not more? Why not short, training montages of Kakashi having them spar and him Kakashi guiding them through techniques? Kakashi is shown time and time again to be instead _negligent_ and uninterested in furthering their skills. \nAnd Naruto learned Wind control under him in Shippuden, right? When he wasn\u2019t their primary teacher anymore? While Naruto was mastering a technique Kakashi had no hand in helping him learn? That really doesn\u2019t lend evidence to the fact that Kakashi was an excellent teacher, but more evidence how how could and otherwise would have been a better teacher if Kishimoto bothered to remember that he\u2019s a teacher at all. That instance was not a typical student-teacher relationship like they initially had, but more of something closer to equals, which is an interesting and cool aspect of their dynamic, but not one that shows off the teacher Kakashi _should_ have been, as Naruto was no longer his student. It was more like helping a coworker at your job with something they\u2019re inexperienced with, as Kakashi didn\u2019t really need to help Naruto here, and he wouldn\u2019t have been otherwise drafted for the help anyway. His help was a surprise, and not an expectation, and when his help _was_ an expectation, he didn\u2019t do anything.",

When he wasn\u2019t their primary teacher anymore?  \n\nThat doesn't really matter does it? Kakashi was teaching a genin Naruto who was under his supervision. And Naruto calls Kakashi sensei. I really don't know how they can be considered co-workers here.\n\nBesides that, how would you explain Naruto and Sakura's sudden growth if Kakashi was such a terrible teacher?\n\nOut of all the teams Kakashi's team went the furthest in the fighting competition part of the chunin exams. This was despite the fact they faced opponents who were better than them during the academy days.\n\n [These grades are from a data book.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NarutoFanfiction/comments/hr7w7g/narutos_and_his_classmates_academy_grades/fy2g5nf/?context=3) \n\nSo either Asuma and Kurenai were terrible teachers who somehow managed to weaken their students or Kakashi was a great teacher who was able to Improve his students skills to the point where they were able to fight opponents who were once stronger than them and win.\n\nAnd we obviously know that he taught Sasuke the chidori, which ended up being one of Sasuke's most resourceful jutsus. Probably only behind his Mangekyou hax abilities.",

            "body": "PART 3\n\nTLDR; \nThis is the kind of thing I mean - Kishimoto focuses Team 7ms learning for Exposition and Exciting Plot points that undermines the information that is actually conveyed. Kakashi is supposed to be a good and attentive teacher, but the opportunities that we had in canon to support that doesn\u2019t _actually_ support that. You instead have to more or less ignore the implications of what\u2019s actually written as onscreen support of and instead have to assume he was better offscreen. Kakashi as a teacher suffers as a character because Kishimoto did not properly support that aspect of him because he was focused on making things Interesting, not make his world building make sense. Kishimoto\u2019s world building takes a backseat a bit too often with how many things don\u2019t seem to make sense as they should. That\u2019s to be expected, but it tends to happen a bit too often and early in Naruto\u2019s writing, but it isn\u2019t well addressed even later. Kishimoto had a lot of great ideas, but his shoddy execution had the story suffer for it, and Kakashi as a teacher is just one of them. One of the main reasons his other manga he released a few years ago failed is because he kept rushing things without properly fleshing them out, and the story very much suffered for it. Kakashi is more a victim of Kishimoto not being nearly as good of a writer as the story needed him to be, and I stand by that idea very strongly.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m taking this too seriously, but I wanted to try to explain why \u201cKakashi is not as good of a teacher as he\u2019s supposed to be\u201d is something I very much transcribe to. I love Kakashi and I love his potential, and as much as I love the idea of him being a good teacher to Team 7, the reality of canon doesn\u2019t really support that. The only reason it stands as strong as it does is simply because he\u2019s constantly supposed to be read that way - \u201cbecause Kishimoto says so,\u201d not because the canon supports that. He\u2019s like Sakura - she has a lot of great potential and is definitely _supposed_ to be a very strong and formidable ninja in her own right, it\u2019s just that Kishimoto actively avoided displaying that in the canon under the excuse that he \u201ccan\u2019t write girls\u201d or something. It\u2019s why her best show of acting on that potential was during the last arc during a war, rather than during the times she _did_ fight fights that were rather lackluster and few incomparison to even more minor side characters. For a major character, he doesn\u2019t really treat her like one. She was more than a healer, and very capable in an outright fight. Kishimoto not putting effort into actually having Sakura put her money where her mouth is is why she\u2019s such a hated and \u201cuseless\u201d character.",

            "body": "> And we can count on one hand the when we saw Kakashi make a point to teach his 3 students something at all\n\nI mean, how much of the time they were under him was actually shown in the manga? We basically saw like 2 weeks of it and even in that brief amount of time we saw him teach them something new.\n\n> he didn\u2019t take the time to train them when it was peaceful, which is stupid. \n\nHe did. Otherwise it makes no sense for Naruto and Sakura to become so much better while under him. \n\n>And Naruto learned Wind control under him in Shippuden, right? When he wasn\u2019t their primary teacher anymore?  \n\nThat doesn't really matter does it? Kakashi was teaching a genin Naruto who was under his supervision. And Naruto calls Kakashi sensei. I really don't know how they can be considered co-workers here.\n\nBesides that, how would you explain Naruto and Sakura's sudden growth if Kakashi was such a terrible teacher?\n\nOut of all the teams Kakashi's team went the furthest in the fighting competition part of the chunin exams. This was despite the fact they faced opponents who were better than them during the academy days.\n\n [These grades are from a data book.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NarutoFanfiction/comments/hr7w7g/narutos_and_his_classmates_academy_grades/fy2g5nf/?context=3) \n\nSo either Asuma and Kurenai were terrible teachers who somehow managed to weaken their students or Kakashi was a great teacher who was able to Improve his students skills to the point where they were able to fight opponents who were once stronger than them and win.\n\nAnd we obviously know that he taught Sasuke the chidori, which ended up being one of Sasuke's most resourceful jutsus. Probably only behind his Mangekyou hax abilities.",
