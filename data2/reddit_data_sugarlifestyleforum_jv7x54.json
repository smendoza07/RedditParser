    "body": "First - I am a woman myself and this is in no way meant to be victim blaming. However, if you\u2019re going to experiment with sugar dating you HAVE to be aware of these things. It can literally be life or death, so please don\u2019t be offended if you feel called out. \n\nAnyways, I\u2019ll see posts on here on a very regular basis of women talking about the most insane experiences with men they meet from seeking. Women who drive over to a man\u2019s apartment to meet him for the very first time, or they let him pick her up in his car despite never meeting before, and they don\u2019t share their location with friends because they don\u2019t want anyone to know they sugar. I just read a post today about a women who literally took drugs from a man WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING WHAT THEY WERE! Women who feel pressured to get uncomfortable intoxicated, or feel pressured into doing acts that they\u2019re not comfortable with, women who don\u2019t get paid their fair share of an agreed allowance, etc.  \n\nLadies - you HAVE to be able to set firm boundaries, especially when meeting someone for the first time. You literally need to think of the worst case scenario that could possibly happen, and then do everything in your power to ensure that there\u2019s no way you end up in that scenario. Meeting for the first time should absolutely always be in public, with your own form of transportation both ways, even if he seems nice and offers you a ride back. The first few intimate meetings should preferably be in a hotel rather than his own place. Your location should absolutely always be shared with someone. And I know this part is so hard, especially because you never want to seem rude, but if you\u2019re getting ANY sort of red flags from a guy on a meet and greet, just leave. If you have your own form of transportation this shouldn\u2019t be an issue. If you\u2019re worried about appearing rude, make something up - say your friend just called and there\u2019s an emergency, you\u2019re not feeling well, your roommate is locked out, etc. Ideally you should always have a back up plan in case things go south. \n\nI can\u2019t count the number of times I\u2019ve read posts on here and I\u2019m like holy shit that girl is lucky to even be alive. I know hindsight is 20/20, but you have to be aware of these red flags before they happen, and you have to trust your gut. It\u2019s literally your life that is at stake here. \n\nI\u2019ve also seen a lot of posts recently of women posting screenshots of lengthy text conversations with rude/arrogant/creepy men. While they\u2019re sometimes entertaining, these are usually conversations that should have been cut off and ended within the first few messages. The fact that some women are willing to continue to engage and try to reason with these men is another red flag. See how these red flags seem to build up really fast? That\u2019s why you should ignore them the first time you see them and not when you\u2019re 10 red flags in and it\u2019s too late.",

Like yes it can definitely be amazing, but that only happens when you\u2019re able to weed through all the red flags and find someone you can actually trust to respect you and your boundaries. It\u2019s not all about instant gratification and meeting the first guy who offers you x amount even if it means ignoring a few things that rubbed you the wrong way. There\u2019s probably a reason for that",

I\u2019m not here to bash the women who may struggle with setting firm boundaries or standing up for themselves. I\u2019m just here to tell them they shouldn\u2019t be sugaring if that\u2019s the case, unless they\u2019re willing to take on that huge risk, which I would not recommend",

Even if you do everything in your power to be safe, there are still very real risks. There have been enough posts on here about being raped, assaulted, drugged, manipulated, made to be afraid for their life, being given viral STIs etc. \n\nHow many times do women in this community need to be hurt before people wise up, and start treating the risks seriously?\n\nPSA: \n\nif you don\u2019t have a backbone, you should not sugar. You have to be able to say no a hundred times and stick to it. You have to trust your instincts, and not allow some dude to override your feelings. You have to have firm and clear boundaries. You have to be able to walk away. \n\nIf you can\u2019t talk about safe sex practices, talk about the finances, talk about your expectations and needs...you should not sugar. All of these thing are difficult and uncomfortable at first, but it gets easier. You can\u2019t skirt around these things. \n\nTo OP, this is post that the sub Reddit needs on the regular. Mandatory readings are great...if people do them. The reality of sugaring is so different than the fantasy or perception. SBs need to know.",

A lot of these posts come from girls my age and I think so many of these men seek us because we lack experience.

It prevents us from learning from mistakes others have made and teach others not to make those same mistakes.  \n\nIn business, we study industrial accidents very closely, learn from the mistakes made by the victim, co-workers, procedures, the company they work for and the manufactures of equipment they use.  This has led to an order of magnitude reduction in industrial accidents and deaths.  It's how we learn.  Not allowing a discussion of the mistakes made, makes it unsafe for everyone.",

I wonder how many crimes have happened as a result of people being desperate for money/sex (yes, even sugar daddies can get robbed), of course we wouldn't hear about it because it is such a taboo that one would rather risk their life than to take reasonable precautions. I find that unacceptable. I wish there were better and safer ways to engage in sugar lifestyle. It can be a wonderful thing, but it is spoiled by the risk it involves.",

When I talk to some of these young girls and they tell me these things, the hair on the back of my neck stands up.  I feel obligated to warn them of the dangers and to be on guard.\n\nThe first meeting should be in public - whether its coffee or dinner, anything else to me is extremely risky.  True, a guy can hide his true self and wait to do his crazy stuff on the next meet, but at least you have an idea of who he is, what type of person he is, and whether you'd get along or not.  And by the way, this holds true for the sugar daddy too.  Do either of you want some crazy stranger knowing personal items about you prior to starting a relationship?\n\nRed flags are red flags. Don't let dollar signs cause us to not see them.\n\nOne more comment and I'll probably get fussed at for stating it.  But a lot of Sugar babies complain about SD's wanting a \"cheap ho\".  Which is true, a lot of them do - hence the Splenda daddy tag.  But the reverse is true.  If a girl lets a guy come by and pick her up for a nominal PPM fee, is she really a sugar baby or something else?  I think she's something else.\n\nThis is a very expensive \"hobby\" and a lot of guys just want to be a sugar daddy, but can't afford it. I liken it to being a member of a $100,000 a year country club and you still have to pay green fees.  Its not cheap.  In fact, I think golf is cheaper!  :)",

I\u2019m not here to bash the women who may struggle with setting firm boundaries or standing up for themselves. I\u2019m just here to tell them they shouldn\u2019t be sugaring if that\u2019s the case, unless they\u2019re willing to take on that huge risk, which I would not recommend",

Even if you do everything in your power to be safe, there are still very real risks. There have been enough posts on here about being raped, assaulted, drugged, manipulated, made to be afraid for their life, being given viral STIs etc. \n\nHow many times do women in this community need to be hurt before people wise up, and start treating the risks seriously?\n\nPSA: \n\nif you don\u2019t have a backbone, you should not sugar. You have to be able to say no a hundred times and stick to it. You have to trust your instincts, and not allow some dude to override your feelings. You have to have firm and clear boundaries. You have to be able to walk away. \n\nIf you can\u2019t talk about safe sex practices, talk about the finances, talk about your expectations and needs...you should not sugar. All of these thing are difficult and uncomfortable at first, but it gets easier. You can\u2019t skirt around these things. \n\nTo OP, this is post that the sub Reddit needs on the regular. Mandatory readings are great...if people do them. The reality of sugaring is so different than the fantasy or perception. SBs need to know.",

Some kids need that stern and tough tone to truly understand the warning. \n\nThe girls who ended up in these unfortunate situations may have needed that stern warning post instead of a post talking about how wonderful their sb lifestyle is. It's not implying they're to blame, it's just another way to warn them, and if it can save another woman from that fate, then we should welcome it.",

They may ignore the warning because it doesn't seem serious when being told in a calm/relaxed way. They might not see the severity of touching the fire. Some kids need that stern and tough tone to truly understand the warning. \n\nThe girls who ended up in these unfortunate situations may have needed that stern warning post instead of a post talking about how wonderful their sb lifestyle is. It's not implying they're to blame, it's just another way to warn them, and if it can save another woman from that fate, then we should welcome it.",
