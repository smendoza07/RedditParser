    "body": "I\u2019m sharing this mostly for newer SB\u2019s/SB\u2019s having a hard time in the bowl. I get so sad reading all the SLF posts about salt daddies & abusers. There **are** good SD\u2019s out there. \n\n\nMy SD went on a 3 day work trip and when he got back asked to see me. It was my time of the month, so I told him. I was expecting him to say nvm/want to reschedule because intimacy was off the table.. Instead, he said he still missed me and thought I should come over anyway. Half of me was confused if he understood. He sent another text saying he\u2019d make me a steak with mashed potatoes and had some chocolate candy from his kids if I wanted it. I said \u201c ok :) \u201c.  When I made it to his house we had dinner, watched a movie, cuddled and he rubbed my back and we fell asleep. The next morning I had to leave for work and wasn\u2019t expecting my allowance. I gave him a kiss goodbye, and he gave me the usual ppm. He said he understands women need a break sometimes, and would never push me or coerce me. Ladies, this is what a good SD looks like. They should care about you inside AND outside the bedroom!\n\n-Edit: Some people are missing the point! It\u2019s not about bare minimum. (Unless you want me to brag about all the gifts, trips and how much allowance I get) \ud83d\ude44 The point is, my SD knew it would be a platonic meet but still catered to me & gave me the full ppm. Don\u2019t settle for pushy SD\u2019s or salt daddies.",
