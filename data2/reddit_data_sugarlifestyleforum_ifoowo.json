I dont go put because I am broke. I dont want to be spending your allowance just to have a girls\u2019 night out every weekend (i worked hard for it lol). \n\nSincerely,\nB**tch im broke",

I personally would much rather my SBs be saving the money I give them and using it for necessities than wasting it partying.  But then again, it's not my place to tell them what to do with their own money, and it seems awfully presumptive of your SDs to feel like they have any say over what you do with yours.  \n\nIt may be different strokes for different folks, but both of my SBs are in school and my allowance means they don't require a job, so they can focus more on their studies (and of course our relationship too).",
