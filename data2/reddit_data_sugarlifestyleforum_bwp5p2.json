    "body": "If you do not fit the Cosmo /Hollywood bullshit images sold so thoroughly...\n\nMy great partner is petite and curvy and honestly thinks herself less attractive than most. She believes there is something a bit off about me to be so attracted.  She grew up with a lot of the classic bad behavior from her mom to sell those ideas.  Anyway, for a little objective evidence...\n\nMy SGF was taking an Uber.  Black crop top and high waist jeans.  The woman driving her Uber said:\n\n\"I have not been right in my faith for a while, but your waist to booty ratio proves that God is good!\"",

My SD didn't tell the story quite right, and I think this woman's words were really important.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hopped into the backseat, and this woman, maybe ten years older than me, turned and looked at me over her shoulder. \"You know,\" she said, \"this morning I asked for a sign. I been feelin' weak in my faith.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI nod. *Okay, hoo boy*, I think. I'm not from the American South and I know I am up for something, because people don't start conversations this way at home. The woman continues: \"This morning I had to ask, but now I been sittin', and I thought maybe that was selfish of me.\" She paused for dramatic effect. Y'all, I'm not joking.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"But then you opened the door.\" And now she really twists in her seat. \"You came out that store and straight to my car. And I saw your waist-to-booty ratio, and I knew that God is good.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFWIW, I'm a strong 5'2, I wear a 30G, and as many women know the experience: if something can squeeze past my thighs, it gapes at my waist. Clothes shopping is always demoralising. I've struggled with disordered eating since childhood, and I've been hospitalised for it more than once. I have a really hard time with my body... and my SD praises me to kingdom come. If you have body issues, though, you know that someone else thinking nice things doesn't change how you think bad things. And I would also like to point out that he enjoys both pickles and the potato salad made with mayo, so clearly he's not well-adjusted, either.",

I am also a model. I had a SD dismiss me once because I wasn't slim. He wanted 110 lbs 34DD... it didn't phase me. I like who I am. I am the total petite. In celebrating who I am, I don't dishonor anyone else. It is uplifting to see a SD speak out for a demographic, that by seeking arrangements own statistics,  does not fair as well on their site.",
