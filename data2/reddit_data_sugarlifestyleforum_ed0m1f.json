    "body": "Last night was kind of interesting.  I went on a M&G dinner date. With a 22 year old SB.  During dinner she was constantly on her phone texting and using Snapchat in the middle of conversation.  \n\nSo after about 15 minutes I got my phone out of my pocket and opened SA.  After 5 minutes she asked me what I was doing. And I replied I'm setting up another date because you obviously aren't interested in me. she looked a little shocked.  Childish I know.  But dam it was fun to see her reaction.",
