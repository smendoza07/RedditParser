    "body": "I was having dinner with a sugar baby, and she starts talking about how good she is at Mario Kart. I almost spit out my passion fruit cosmo when she tells me that she can \"definitely\" beat me. Wow. I'm dating the Bernie Madoff of sugar babies. She talked so much trash, I was genuinely concerned it would spontaneously form into actual garbage coming out of her mouth. \n#\nI'm actually the world's greatest Mario Kart racer, and I tried to politely explain that my Mario Kart victories are legendary. I was very honest with her and told her that I spent my thirties figuring out how to beat rainbow road with just my left hand.  My right hand... well, princess peach hunched over that mini bike like a snack... I mean, I am a guy.  Drove a lot of stick shift, ya know?  My SB just wasn't listening, and a couple weeks from now, the poor girl is all set up to have baby Luigi *spank her* on a molecular level.\n#\nSo, as a sd, am I supposed to let her win one race? I am trying to be polite, but I doubt I can do that. I could try to not lap her in every race, but even if I close my eyes, I'm still going to win out of pure muscle memory. I don't want her to think I'm a jerk, but I don't think she knows that I am genetically unable to show mercy in Mario Kart.  \n#\nOn one hand, I like her, and it might save the relationship if I at least stay within one or two time zones of her on the races. On the other hand, I've got this end zone dance I call the \"flexasaurus\" all worked out, and I've never had a chance to use it.\n#\nWhat say you, slf?",

I know you\u2019re just dying to use that joke on the SB. \n\nI\u2019m partial to Donkey Kong Country myself.

She might beat you of her own skill, or you might have to let her win. In any case, always only losing sucks especially if you have a competitive streak. So let her win *something* if you can't let her win Mario kart! Winning after losing feels amazing, might even inspire some impassioned victory sex from her ;)",

(Really not trying to mix those terms, I was the youngest.) \n\nWe played foosball. Brutally. He was *really* good at foosball. Like... I couldn't beat him unless he was injured & I got really lucky, level.\n\nThe worst wins *OR* losses to (Actual) Dad were games where he'd essentially let me get to a tie at 9-9 with him, usually coming back from being down by a couple, then he'd annihilate the last 2 shots in ways that beyond solidified his win. (We also enforced the winning by 2 points rule. To further complicate things.) I'd get some amazing block, he'd slam the ball past my goalie. I'd think I finally had him - he'd pull out some ridiculous play. \n\nThe real way to torture your SB is probably to practice ahead of time & make sure your tricks & skills are intact, set up a session to play her, and let her almost win. Come back and destroy her, in impressive way with little time left, and if you're as good as you say you are, you should pull off a victory.\n\nGood luck. :)",
