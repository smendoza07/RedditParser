My hair grows really thick and fast too, so I've saved a lot of trips and a lot of money. I do my own fades and I honestly wouldn't trust a barber to do a good job these days!\n\nIt's heaps easier than you think, and you'll get faster over time. Used to take me a while to do it, but nowadays, it doesn't take long at all.",

Sounds a bit counter-intuitive, but I think having clippers you're familiar with is just as important as having good ones. It's like a musical instrument... you can really do well once you get a good feel for how it feels in your hand and how it performs etc.\n\nProbably not the answer you were after, so I'll give you an actual answer and say Wahl seems to be a concensus good brand. If you're in the US it's probably quite easy to get them. I'm not American and I think I'm gonna get myself aome Wahl clippers when my current ones finally give up.",
