    "body": "[Soompi article](https://www.soompi.com/article/1483930wpp/running-man-cast-celebrates-the-program-becoming-longest-running-korean-variety-show)\n\nThe cast and crew of SBS\u2019s \u201cRunning Man\u201d celebrated the show reaching an impressive milestone!\n\nOn the August 15 episode of \u201cRunning Man,\u201d the production staff proudly brought up the fact that after airing 564 episodes, the program had officially overtaken MBC\u2019s \u201cInfinite Challenge\u201d to become the longest-running Korean variety show.\n\nDuring the opening of the show, the PD (producing director) told the cast, \u201cThere\u2019s good news for the members to celebrate. With yesterday\u2019s broadcast \\[the episode that aired the day before the shoot\\], we became the longest-running variety show.\u201d\n\nYang Se Chan happily replied, \u201cIt was originally \u2018Infinite Challenge,\u2019 right? We broke that record.\u201d\n\nYoo Jae Suk, who was also a cast member on \u201cInfinite Challenge\u201d together with HaHa, explained, \u201cIf you look at it by years, \u2018Infinite Challenge\u2019 ran for about two years longer, but there were so many weeks during that time where the show didn\u2019t air because of things like the network strike. So if you look at the number of episodes, \u2018Running Man\u2019 has more.\u201d\n\nYang Se Chan remarked in awe, \u201cSo does this mean \\[Yoo Jae Suk\\] and \\[HaHa\\] broke the record twice? That\u2019s so cool.\u201d",
