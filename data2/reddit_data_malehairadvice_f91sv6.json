Without the wrinkles, I feel like there's too much space on the forehead that need to be covered but it really just depends on what you want to go for. If you want to look casual in business this is the one. If you want to look like a badass model then try some hard spiky side part.  \nIf you're into the business casual look then IMO, do not shorten the sides, I really love this classic side part; maybe try changing the hair product and try to comb your hair foward a little bit more will make it looks more textured.",
