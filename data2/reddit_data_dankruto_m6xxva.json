It was already going to be the exact same mindset for Naruto, hell the Shikamaru 5 already had their mission before Sakura came running up crying, making it all about her. And tbh, Sasuke didn't give af about Sakura during his vengeance tour; Naruto was the one who entirely won him back. Hell, I think Sai had a greater impact on Sasuke's return to Konoha than Sakura lmfao",

They are really good.\n\nFor clarity: fillers are episodes that were made to \"fill\" time because the anime advanced way faster than the manga. They had to air something while the manga was being done and therefore these fillers are \"non-canon\".",

It was already going to be the exact same mindset for Naruto, hell the Shikamaru 5 already had their mission before Sakura came running up crying, making it all about her. And tbh, Sasuke didn't give af about Sakura during his vengeance tour; Naruto was the one who entirely won him back. Hell, I think Sai had a greater impact on Sasuke's return to Konoha than Sakura lmfao",

They are really good.\n\nFor clarity: fillers are episodes that were made to \"fill\" time because the anime advanced way faster than the manga. They had to air something while the manga was being done and therefore these fillers are \"non-canon\".",

It was already going to be the exact same mindset for Naruto, hell the Shikamaru 5 already had their mission before Sakura came running up crying, making it all about her. And tbh, Sasuke didn't give af about Sakura during his vengeance tour; Naruto was the one who entirely won him back. Hell, I think Sai had a greater impact on Sasuke's return to Konoha than Sakura lmfao",

It was already going to be the exact same mindset for Naruto, hell the Shikamaru 5 already had their mission before Sakura came running up crying, making it all about her. And tbh, Sasuke didn't give af about Sakura during his vengeance tour; Naruto was the one who entirely won him back. Hell, I think Sai had a greater impact on Sasuke's return to Konoha than Sakura lmfao",

Fuck you villagers you don't get to pretend you didn't emotionally, psychologically, and in some cases physically abuse and neglect a child for over a decade and a half and then turn around and act like he's the best thing that's ever happened to Konoha once he's proved himself useful to you. \n\nHe shouldn't have had to work as hard as he did just to earn the villager's approval, hell if anything the villagers are the ones who should be putting in an effort to try and earn his forgiveness. \n\nIf there is anyone who doesn't deserve all the hard work Naruto put into rescuing them, it's the villagers of Konoha.",

It was already going to be the exact same mindset for Naruto, hell the Shikamaru 5 already had their mission before Sakura came running up crying, making it all about her.
