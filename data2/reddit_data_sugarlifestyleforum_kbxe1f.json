    "body": "Another update: sure, I\u2019ll show you the pictures EXCEPT that would be TOTALLY unprofessional. So pls stop dming about that. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s very hard to find pictures of pretty girls on the internet, or so I\u2019ve heard. Thank you. \n\nUpdated, see end. \n\nAside from my actual profession in the finance industry I also have a photography studio and do a little bit of commercial work, mostly with photography clients I\u2019ve worked with for decades. Recently I\u2019ve decided to renew my portfolio and I\u2019ve done a few portfolio sessions with aspiring models. I should note here that I\u2019ve never made a pass at a model, even when I was much younger and did lots of model and fashion shoots. \n\nAnyway. A couple weeks ago I photograph a girl who wants to get into modelling. Tonight I\u2019m a bit bored and browse SA - I\u2019m really not there a lot - and scrolling down I go \u201chey that\u2019s a much better picture than usual... hmm, I recognise that picture... oh... oh...\u201d\n\nFunny thing is, she\u2019s coming in for another session tomorrow...\n\nUpdate: session\u2019s just wrapped, no funny business. We did do some semi risqu\u00e9 pics (though nothing that couldn\u2019t be shown on Netflix)",

On the other, if I were her and you\u2019d seen me on SA after shooting me I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d want to know. Especially if I planned to continue to use you as my photog. I\u2019d feel self conscious in front of your camera after it came out and that would steal the experience of having a photog I was comfortable with, which is really a bigger deal than many might think! You\u2019re really the only one that can decide since you know her mannerisms, personality etc. and might be able to gauge whether or not it would freak her out. The only thing I\u2019m decidedly against is ever messaging her on the site. Bringing it up in person after you\u2019ve already completed tomorrow\u2019s shoot could possibly end well!",

And then maybe things progress more organically or maybe you just have a friend?

I might also assume he wants things from me I don\u2019t want to give, worry about him outing me if I didn\u2019t give them and more. He hasn\u2019t said *anything* here to make me think he\u2019s a bad person and I can\u2019t guarantee that\u2019s how she\u2019d feel, but it\u2019s 100% a risk. It sounds like that\u2019s not a risk worth taking, since he does enjoy shooting her and takes his work seriously. Imagine her not being okay with this conversation and then telling her other young, attractive friends in the area what happened from her perspective. That could ruin his chances in the local bowl *and* his reputation as a photog that young women feel comfortable around, as well as blow any discretion he\u2019s currently got. OP, I\u2019d consider *all* of what I just said because I hadn\u2019t thought of any of it, earlier! /u/alias_obvs",

I\u2019d feel self conscious in front of your camera after it came out and that would steal the experience of having a photog I was comfortable with, which is really a bigger deal than many might think! You\u2019re really the only one that can decide since you know her mannerisms, personality etc. and might be able to gauge whether or not it would freak her out. The only thing I\u2019m decidedly against is ever messaging her on the site. Bringing it up in person after you\u2019ve already completed tomorrow\u2019s shoot could possibly end well!",

I might also assume he wants things from me I don\u2019t want to give, worry about him outing me if I didn\u2019t give them and more. He hasn\u2019t said *anything* here to make me think he\u2019s a bad person and I can\u2019t guarantee that\u2019s how she\u2019d feel, but it\u2019s 100% a risk. It sounds like that\u2019s not a risk worth taking, since he does enjoy shooting her and takes his work seriously. Imagine her not being okay with this conversation and then telling her other young, attractive friends in the area what happened from her perspective. That could ruin his chances in the local bowl *and* his reputation as a photog that young women feel comfortable around, as well as blow any discretion he\u2019s currently got.

It sounds like that\u2019s not a risk worth taking, since he does enjoy shooting her and takes his work seriously. Imagine her not being okay with this conversation and then telling her other young, attractive friends in the area what happened from her perspective.

I might also assume he wants things from me I don\u2019t want to give, worry about him outing me if I didn\u2019t give them and more. He hasn\u2019t said *anything* here to make me think he\u2019s a bad person and I can\u2019t guarantee that\u2019s how she\u2019d feel, but it\u2019s 100% a risk. It sounds like that\u2019s not a risk worth taking, since he does enjoy shooting her and takes his work seriously. Imagine her not being okay with this conversation and then telling her other young, attractive friends in the area what happened from her perspective. That could ruin his chances in the local bowl *and* his reputation as a photog that young women feel comfortable around, as well as blow any discretion he\u2019s currently got.

I might also assume he wants things from me I don\u2019t want to give, worry about him outing me if I didn\u2019t give them and more. He hasn\u2019t said *anything* here to make me think he\u2019s a bad person and I can\u2019t guarantee that\u2019s how she\u2019d feel, but it\u2019s 100% a risk. It sounds like that\u2019s not a risk worth taking, since he does enjoy shooting her and takes his work seriously. Imagine her not being okay with this conversation and then telling her other young, attractive friends in the area what happened from her perspective. That could ruin his chances in the local bowl *and* his reputation as a photog that young women feel comfortable around, as well as blow any discretion he\u2019s currently got.
