    "body": "I could not be more grateful that I met this man. He\u2019s brought so much more to my life than financial stability\u2026 we\u2019re accountability partners, we support each other; we bring out the best in one another. We communicate frequently and thoroughly about anything that comes up. We check in with each other. I have become so much stronger as a person thanks to having someone I\u2019m so deeply intimate with to encourage me and remind me of my goals, and because of how exhilarating it is to make him proud. \n\nReally. It began in a whirlwind that felt too good to be true, with I-love-yous flowing honestly from about 4 months in. Kink-wise, we have a harmony that is impeccable and addicting, both when the intensity hits its heights and when it ebbs into a sweeter and calmer expression. \n\nWe were, and are, an unlikely pair. And we still cannot get enough of each other. I\u2019m just so thankful for him. My life is now not only happy, but deeply peaceful and thrilling. \n\nJust overflowing with joy, and wanted to be a positive voice here. Really really good things can and do come from this lifestyle. And they\u2019re no less real than the bad.",
