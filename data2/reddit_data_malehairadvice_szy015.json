Just make sure to do your own research, talk to a professional and make an informed decision.\n\n[https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/finasteride/](https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/finasteride/)\n\nThe side affects of finasteride include hormone imbalance, impotence, reduced sperm count and excess body sensitivity.",
