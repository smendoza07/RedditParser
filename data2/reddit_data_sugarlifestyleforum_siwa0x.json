    "body": "This life (for me) is just too much. I was called by his wife a few hours ago asking who I am (she called from my SD's phone) and I hung up immediately. She then proceeded to call me from two different numbers, which I have blocked. Prior to me blocking her, she left a voicemail stating that \"I'm coming for you, you f\\*\\*\\*ing whore\". I am not worried in the least because I'm pretty sure this is an empty threat and even if it escalates, I can and will defend myself. I hate that I am in this predicament because he was the one who said we should hang out today, which is why I was texting him to confirm. Apparently she saw a single emoji (he had deleted the rest of the thread) and that was enough for all hell to break loose. This is exhausting and I'm pretty sure I'm done. I appreciate what he has done for me thus far but this has all put a really bad taste in my mouth.",

The opposing option, that one's trusted and committed partner betrayed them so hurtfully, might be too cognitively or emotionally over-taxing for someone to think clearly or rationally about in a long while. Especially not in the heat of the moment. \n\n\nSo, they aren't mad at the \"Mistress\" per se, but at their partner's utter betrayal (which the Mistress represents physically), or even at themselves for being duped by someone they love. \n\nI am, by no means an expert.

I never cheated on a boyfriend and my SD of two years is single or, more realistically, I am his girlfriend.\n\nBut if I put myself in my twenty years older self's shoes and imagine my hypothetical husband cheating on me, I would judge *him* morally. I don't see what I would find unethical about the hypothetical side chick's behaviour. Maybe, I am ultra-liberal on this issue. Or, on the contrary, I am more traditional than most others, in that I would be unhappy about him *wanting* to cheat on me. The actual execution wouldn't really matter to me. So, it's not even relevant whether hypothetical side chick said \"yes\" or \"no, I don't want you to cheat on your wife\". She can answer whatever she wants.

Regardless of what your reason was, you gotta know that sleeping with someone else\u2019s husband was wrong. And you would be furious if it was done to you. So you might have to deal with some karma for a lil while. \n\nOn the other hand, he made a vow to her, not you. And him being married sorta works in your favor because you can be the light in his life, but he can go home at the end of it all and be her responsibility. And you\u2019re being compensated for being his side piece\u2026\n\nThen somewhere in the middle of all that, there\u2019s variables. Perhaps he did not tell you he was married. Or he told you that he was going to end that situation soon. But consider that if/when she discovers he is being unfaithful, the jig is up. His ability to provide the sugar might fall apart. Because in a divorce she is DEFINITELY going to take all she can. \n\nBottom line, you knew the job was dangerous when you took it. You knew those possibilities were based in reality. But at the same time, maybe suggest he had a whole other phone that she did not know about. Or tell him save your number under \u201cfrank lawson\u201d. On days you meet, say hey buddy? Still on for golf this afternoon? If you are going to participate in doing dirt make sure it\u2019s done right\u2026think of what you would think. And direct him how to NOT get you both into some shit. \n\nJust my opinion. Not meant in any derogatory manner. Sorry if it came across as abrasive. Tact isn\u2019t my strongest quality. \ud83e\udd10",

I have a job, a comfortable living situation, luxury items on my own but I just wanted to get out of debt faster. I should have taken into his account his situation. I no longer want to creep around. I want to be able to enjoy lunch, go on various adventures and see each other at varying times. This arrangement isn\u2019t fun and now shit really hit the fan. He said he\u2019s done \u201cdamage control\u201d (right) but I will never be comfortable dealing with him again. I won\u2019t. \n\nYes it would bother me if done to me but I have to accept the fact if I won\u2019t please him, someone else will. I probably will be too invested in my career to care lmao (applying to medical school). Not saying that makes what I did right. \n\nThank you for your words.",

SDs and SBs occasionally let their guards down due to inattention, poor operational security (OPSEC) or lack of experience with phones or IT.  The fact that she called from his phone tells me that he hasn't done a very good job at OPSEC.  It also tells me that he has had a track record of dalliances.  Otherwise, she wouldn't be checking out his phone to begin with.  \n\nI don't think it has anything to do with the SD being single or in a relationship.  There are tons of articles and posts out there about making sure you have a separate \"burner phone\" for these activities.  Yes, you have to make sure that your spouse or SO doesn't know about it.  Good OPSEC also means that a SD or SB may not be able to immediately have a voice or text conversation.",

He\u2019s going to see other girls/women regardless and his wife should either leave him or deal with it. It\u2019s not your fault and shouldn\u2019t be your problem to deal with it. Honestly no offence to your SD but sounds like he needs to grow a pair if his wife took his phone and was calling you",

So don't quit sugaring because of this, find a better man.\n\nI'm divorced and no quarrels and issues so there are plenty of divorced or single men.",

He was trying to start a fight, but I just stood up, apologized to him for causing him any pain, said I had no idea she was married, and that I would not be seeing her again, and left. \n\nAll of which was true, as she had lied to me about her situation. \n\nThat is one of the dangers of this lifestyle, for both sides, wanting to keep some things private, which is perfectly understandable, but it can come back to bite you on the bottom. \n\nI am single, and I am looking more for a girlfriend I provide for situation than strictly SB, and am open about that from the get go, but of course it all starts at the same point and either grows to that or it doesn\u2019t. Problems like this definitely mean it won\u2019t, lol. \n\nSorry you went thru this, I know how stressful it can be. Better luck in the future!",

The opposing option, that one's trusted and committed partner betrayed them so hurtfully, might be too cognitively or emotionally over-taxing for someone to think clearly or rationally about in a long while. Especially not in the heat of the moment. \n\n\nSo, they aren't mad at the \"Mistress\" per se, but at their partner's utter betrayal (which the Mistress represents physically), or even at themselves for being duped by someone they love. \n\nI am, by no means an expert.

But I just don't see why having sex with a married person is contradictory to upholding morals/ethics. I am not a party to their marriage.

I never cheated on a boyfriend and my SD of two years is single or, more realistically, I am his girlfriend.\n\nBut if I put myself in my twenty years older self's shoes and imagine my hypothetical husband cheating on me, I would judge *him* morally. I don't see what I would find unethical about the hypothetical side chick's behaviour. Maybe, I am ultra-liberal on this issue. Or, on the contrary, I am more traditional than most others, in that I would be unhappy about him *wanting* to cheat on me. The actual execution wouldn't really matter to me. So, it's not even relevant whether hypothetical side chick said \"yes\" or \"no, I don't want you to cheat on your wife\". She can answer whatever she wants.

I have a job, a comfortable living situation, luxury items on my own but I just wanted to get out of debt faster. I should have taken into his account his situation. I no longer want to creep around. I want to be able to enjoy lunch, go on various adventures and see each other at varying times. This arrangement isn\u2019t fun and now shit really hit the fan. He said he\u2019s done \u201cdamage control\u201d (right) but I will never be comfortable dealing with him again. I won\u2019t. \n\nYes it would bother me if done to me but I have to accept the fact if I won\u2019t please him, someone else will. I probably will be too invested in my career to care lmao (applying to medical school). Not saying that makes what I did right. \n\nThank you for your words.",

Also, your moral compass seems to be a little fucked up. It takes two people to fuck around on his wife.  She knew he was married.  She continued to fuck the guy, even after the wife confronted her - multiple times.  She then taunted the wife for sport.  And, upon reflection she thought it to be a lot of fun.  All she cared about was herself, getting paid, and her own amusement.\n\nMarriages fail.  People cheat.  The guy sounds like a creep and an asshole. Shit happens.  To actively and knowingly participate in it and laugh about how fun it was to interact with his wife is pure narcissistic evil.  Welcome to that club.  You must exude class.",

Especially not in the heat of the moment. \n\n\nSo, they aren't mad at the \"Mistress\" per se, but at their partner's utter betrayal (which the Mistress represents physically), or even at themselves for being duped by someone they love. \n\nI am, by no means an expert.

I never cheated on a boyfriend and my SD of two years is single or, more realistically, I am his girlfriend.\n\nBut if I put myself in my twenty years older self's shoes and imagine my hypothetical husband cheating on me, I would judge *him* morally. I don't see what I would find unethical about the hypothetical side chick's behaviour. Maybe, I am ultra-liberal on this issue. Or, on the contrary, I am more traditional than most others, in that I would be unhappy about him *wanting* to cheat on me. The actual execution wouldn't really matter to me. So, it's not even relevant whether hypothetical side chick said \"yes\" or \"no, I don't want you to cheat on your wife\". She can answer whatever she wants.

The opposing option, that one's trusted and committed partner betrayed them so hurtfully, might be too cognitively or emotionally over-taxing for someone to think clearly or rationally about in a long while. Especially not in the heat of the moment. \n\n\nSo, they aren't mad at the \"Mistress\" per se, but at their partner's utter betrayal (which the Mistress represents physically), or even at themselves for being duped by someone they love. \n\nI am, by no means an expert.

I never cheated on a boyfriend and my SD of two years is single or, more realistically, I am his girlfriend.\n\nBut if I put myself in my twenty years older self's shoes and imagine my hypothetical husband cheating on me, I would judge *him* morally. I don't see what I would find unethical about the hypothetical side chick's behaviour. Maybe, I am ultra-liberal on this issue. Or, on the contrary, I am more traditional than most others, in that I would be unhappy about him *wanting* to cheat on me. The actual execution wouldn't really matter to me.

Also, your moral compass seems to be a little fucked up. It takes two people to fuck around on his wife.  She knew he was married.  She continued to fuck the guy, even after the wife confronted her - multiple times.  She then taunted the wife for sport.  And, upon reflection she thought it to be a lot of fun.  All she cared about was herself, getting paid, and her own amusement.\n\nMarriages fail.  People cheat.  The guy sounds like a creep and an asshole. Shit happens.  To actively and knowingly participate in it and laugh about how fun it was to interact with his wife is pure narcissistic evil.  Welcome to that club.  You must exude class.",

The opposing option, that one's trusted and committed partner betrayed them so hurtfully, might be too cognitively or emotionally over-taxing for someone to think clearly or rationally about in a long while. Especially not in the heat of the moment. \n\n\nSo, they aren't mad at the \"Mistress\" per se, but at their partner's utter betrayal (which the Mistress represents physically), or even at themselves for being duped by someone they love. \n\nI am, by no means an expert.

But I just don't see why having sex with a married person is contradictory to upholding morals/ethics. I am not a party to their marriage. I can think of a hundred of other reasons not to get involved with a married person, but I don't see it as morally wrong.\n\nI have zero personal experience with this. I never cheated on a boyfriend and my SD of two years is single or, more realistically, I am his girlfriend.\n\nBut if I put myself in my twenty years older self's shoes and imagine my hypothetical husband cheating on me, I would judge *him* morally. I don't see what I would find unethical about the hypothetical side chick's behaviour. Maybe, I am ultra-liberal on this issue. Or, on the contrary, I am more traditional than most others, in that I would be unhappy about him *wanting* to cheat on me. The actual execution wouldn't really matter to me. So, it's not even relevant whether hypothetical side chick said \"yes\" or \"no, I don't want you to cheat on your wife\". She can answer whatever she wants. The problem -- for me -- existed from the moment she was asked.",

And, upon reflection she thought it to be a lot of fun.  All she cared about was herself, getting paid, and her own amusement.\n\nMarriages fail.  People cheat.  The guy sounds like a creep and an asshole. Shit happens.  To actively and knowingly participate in it and laugh about how fun it was to interact with his wife is pure narcissistic evil.

Protect your privacy, use a burner number at first, only meet in public places near other people, etc.  \nAt least with SA you can just be very direct in your profile and hopefully weed out incompatible guys before you waste a single minute on them.\nI do the same with search filters.  It is simply more efficient than free styling.\nBest of luck.",
