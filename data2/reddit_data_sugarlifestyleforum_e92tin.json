    "body": "Hello,\nIt\u2019s me. I\u2019m one of you. In fact, I\u2019m probably larger than you.\n\nBut, contrary to beliefs. I score. I score often, and I am typically drooled over. And truth be told you probably could too. \n\nHere\u2019s my list of recommendations.\n\n1. Be fucking confident. It drives the boat.\n2. Be smart. If you don\u2019t know things, research them. Bring a dope conversation to the table and be able to hang. \n3. Flaunt what you have. I mean, if you have great tits, show them. Same for your ass. And wear clothes that flatter your body. \n4. Don\u2019t be afraid of your body, and you know what I mean. Get comfortable in the sheets.\nThrow those hips around and drive the fucking boat. \n5. Invest in yourself. Makeup, clothes, gym membership, drink your water, get your sleep, do your skin care routines. Invest in your beauty inside and out.\n6. AGILITY... google the word. DM if you have questions. \n7. Unleash your inner freak. BOUNCE ON THE DICK.\n8. Stop whining about not being able to find someone and be proactive.\n\n\nI have been doing this for 7 years and have always had an SD and an allowance.\n\nYES YOU CAN FIND IT IN THE BOWL.\nBut not if you don\u2019t think you can.\n\nThank you for listening to my drunken TED TALK.",

However, the practicality and reality of many people's situations can make some of what you said somewhat destructive.\n\nFor example  \"Be fucking confident\". To someone who isn't confident, this can come across as patronizing and lacking empathy. Someone who internally has zero confidence is fully aware they are not confident. Saying just \"be confident\" is not news to them. Saying this can have the opposite effect and further highlight more to them that they not confident.\n\n\" Don\u2019t be afraid of your body \" Body image is a major issue across all of society. Like the confidence issue above, saying that statement is unhelpful. I've seen many examples of stunning women who will constantly point out all the flaws in their body and also not think that they are attractive in their own minds. This kind of statement \"Don\u2019t be afraid of your body\" will raise body issues in many people as it doesn't do much on the \"how\". All it does is point out to them that they are afraid of it, and they still don't know how to change that. Likewise \"Flaunt what you have.\" Well if someone doesn't think they have a part of their body worth flaunting (even though to the outside world they do), how does this help them?\n\nYour point number 5, on the other hand, shows some ideas about how things can be done, unlike 1 and 2.\n\nI understand you are trying to be helpful, but time again I've seen people think they are being helpful, but in reality it has the opposite effect because it doesn't address the underlying issue.",

I don't think fat guys get as much work on that site lol.  Confidence IS very important however and being healthy and fit helps a great deal in the process.  Many of my friends are dancers and fitness models and from their experience they've told me that they've always gotten more attention when they look their best.\nIt's one of the reasons why I also train them.  So with that said if u DO have any questions about diet fitness and nutrition or things like the candida or Redmond salt flush, comment below or hit me up.  My advice is free but my training isn't  :)",

It drives the boat.  \n>  \n>2. Be smart. If you don\u2019t know things, research them. Bring a dope conversation to the table and be able to hang.  \n>  \n>3. Flaunt what you have. I mean, if you have a sense of humour, let it shine. Be a fun person. There's something interesting about you, play it up as best you can.  \n>  \n>4. Don\u2019t be afraid to decline drinks on a date, and you know why. Show them that you don't need to drink for them to have fun with you and drive the fucking boat.  \n>  \n>5. Invest in yourself. Makeup, clothes, therapy, drink your water, get your sleep, do your skin care routines. Invest in your beauty inside and out.  \n>  \n>6. SEDUCTION... google the word. DM if you have questions.  \n>  \n>7. Unleash your inner freak.

I\u2019m one of you. In fact, I\u2019m probably deeper into my addiction battle than you.  \n>  \n>But, contrary to beliefs. It doesn't impact my SRs. My SDs don't even realize, and I am typically drooled over. And truth be told you probably could too.  \n>  \n>Here\u2019s my list of recommendations.  \n>  \n>1. Be fucking confident. It drives the boat.  \n>  \n>2. Be smart. If you don\u2019t know things, research them. Bring a dope conversation to the table and be able to hang.  \n>  \n>3. Flaunt what you have. I mean, if you have a sense of humour, let it shine. Be a fun person. There's something interesting about you, play it up as best you can.  \n>  \n>4. Don\u2019t be afraid to decline drinks on a date, and you know why. Show them that you don't need to drink for them to have fun with you and drive the fucking boat.  \n>  \n>5. Invest in yourself. Makeup, clothes, therapy, drink your water, get your sleep, do your skin care routines. Invest in your beauty inside and out.  \n>  \n>6. SEDUCTION... google the word. DM if you have questions.  \n>  \n>7. Unleash your inner freak. BOUNCE ON THE DICK.  \n>  \n>Thank you for listening to my drunken TED TALK.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n...\n\nYet, nowhere in this post is it normalizing alcoholism/addiction or pushing it onto others...\n\nJust like how the original post isn't normalizing obesity or pushing it onto others.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's a post telling SBs to be confident about themselves regardless of what they or others may perceive is wrong with them -- **leave it at that**.",

I\u2019m one of you. In fact, I\u2019m probably deeper into my addiction battle than you.  \n>  \n>But, contrary to beliefs. It doesn't impact my SRs. My SDs don't even realize, and I am typically drooled over. And truth be told you probably could too.  \n>  \n>Here\u2019s my list of recommendations.  \n>  \n>1. Be fucking confident. It drives the boat.  \n>  \n>2. Be smart. If you don\u2019t know things, research them. Bring a dope conversation to the table and be able to hang.  \n>  \n>3. Flaunt what you have. I mean, if you have a sense of humour, let it shine. Be a fun person. There's something interesting about you, play it up as best you can.  \n>  \n>4. Don\u2019t be afraid to decline drinks on a date, and you know why. Show them that you don't need to drink for them to have fun with you and drive the fucking boat.  \n>  \n>5. Invest in yourself. Makeup, clothes, therapy, drink your water, get your sleep, do your skin care routines. Invest in your beauty inside and out.  \n>  \n>6. SEDUCTION... google the word. DM if you have questions.  \n>  \n>7. Unleash your inner freak. BOUNCE ON THE DICK.  \n>  \n>Thank you for listening to my drunken TED TALK.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n...\n\nYet, nowhere in this post is it normalizing alcoholism/addiction or pushing it onto others...\n\nJust like how the original post isn't normalizing obesity or pushing it onto others.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's a post telling SBs to be confident about themselves regardless of what they or others may perceive is wrong with them -- **leave it at that**.",
