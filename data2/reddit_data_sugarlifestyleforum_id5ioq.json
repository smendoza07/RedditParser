My SB said that to me, that what we do together, and that what I can enable her to do, is something no other man has ever done for her, and that it makes her feel like someone special. \n\nJust being with her makes me feel young.",

OP is always going to be worth more than any amount she is offered. It\u2019s just about finding a monetary amount you are satisfied with and happy about.  \n\nBut your point is very valid.  It's difficult to compress a concept as complex as self-image and self-worth and personal value into a single word or phrase.  When I see people use the word \"worth\" (or when I use it myself), I imagine a complete person, with needs and wants and desires and hopes and dreams, and when I think about their \"worth\" I think about the full picture of them valuing themselves as a full person.  But that concept is immense and compressing it into a single word doesn't do it justice, as you've pointed out.  I've just not come up with a better way to compress it yet, and that's why I use the word \"worth\".  But I totally agree with you, it's incredibly important that the use of that word not be conflated with being a price tag.",

In fact, the very existence of the bowl is a way to put a price on that \"priceless\" apport from SBs.\n\nI don't want to sound cynic but the only real power is in the market: more in demand > more power\n\nThat's true for both vanilla and sugar dating.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\> I wanted to remind them that what they bring to the table in a SR is more valuable than the monetary value a SD brings to the SR. \n\nThat literally can't be true.

OP is always going to be worth more than any amount she is offered. It\u2019s just about finding a monetary amount you are satisfied with and happy about.  \n\nBut your point is very valid.  It's difficult to compress a concept as complex as self-image and self-worth and personal value into a single word or phrase.  When I see people use the word \"worth\" (or when I use it myself), I imagine a complete person, with needs and wants and desires and hopes and dreams, and when I think about their \"worth\" I think about the full picture of them valuing themselves as a full person.  But that concept is immense and compressing it into a single word doesn't do it justice, as you've pointed out.  I've just not come up with a better way to compress it yet, and that's why I use the word \"worth\".  But I totally agree with you, it's incredibly important that the use of that word not be conflated with being a price tag.",
