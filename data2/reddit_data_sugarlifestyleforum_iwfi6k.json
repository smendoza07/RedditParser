    "body": "Been toe dipping on and off in the sugar bowl for a couple years now. But had my second date w a new SD today! Was a fun time and laughed along w my SD, and had a nice lunch and shopping date with myself after. \n\nCame to this sub and stayed for all the great tips, common sense reminders that really have helped inform the decisions that I've made. I totally love lurking around here and reading about different views/experiences, keeps me both informed and entertained hahaha.\n\nHave a great end of the week! Cheers to all you wonderful people \ud83e\udd17",
