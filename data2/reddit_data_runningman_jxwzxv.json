I love how indifferent Dreamie is to the camera. \n\nI have a controversial opinion.\n\nI have found Haha's laugh and reaction fake at times esp when he closes his eyes and laughs loud or sometimes even clapping. I mean I understand RM is a job for the members and other members are for sure exaggerating their reactions and laughs for the audience but it is more obvious for me with Haha. But this ep I could feel he was really there and enjoyed it. \n\nJust my #opinion.",
