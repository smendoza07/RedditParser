One of the waxes I have can do what you see in the picture.

One last touch for OP would be to use hairspray I think. When I was in Japan there were similar hairstyles to this but a little more difficult and those used a lot of hairspray because they would go out of shape pretty quickly due to the wind and such.",

So that's why we have something called hairspray my dude. After doing this apply hairspray and it'll be fine throughout the day as long as you don't touch it. That's all I'll say since the other comments have given YouTube channels and product advice.\n\nYou'll probably have to wake up earlier to do this. It may not be practical for some. You may not be able to do it yourself properly the first time but practice makes perfect. It may not be like this 1:1 but you'll get better eventually. \n\nIf it helps try to get a hand mirror to look at different parts of your hair better when styling if you can. \n\nYou might standout a little but if it makes you happy, go for it. Wake up a little earlier and put in some work. I don't style my hair very often but when I do, I take awhile but I feel satisfied.",

One last touch for OP would be to use hairspray I think. When I was in Japan there were similar hairstyles to this but a little more difficult and those used a lot of hairspray because they would go out of shape pretty quickly due to the wind and such.",
