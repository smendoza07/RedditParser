[Reference photo](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/9c/f6/e6/9cf6e6034fbd19251fbe9ef2c331b981.jpg)\n\nFor styling, she applied a firm hold gel while the hair was wet. Then blow-dried it back and up. Finished it off with a medium hold matte paste styled with fingers.\n\nI would've liked the sideburns and neckline faded but they didn't do that, probably because we were short on time. (20 minutes late to my appointment)\n\nOverall, this was probably the best haircut I've had! Highly recommend Steele Barber in Seattle.",
