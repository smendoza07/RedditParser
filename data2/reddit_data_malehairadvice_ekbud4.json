Email it to agencies and talent companies. This agencies have headhunters but the chances of them finding you are the same as the chances of meeting the love of your life while waiting for the bus. You need to put yourself out there and put a big neon sign over your head that says \"I'm interested in being a model\".\n\nDon't despair, its a tough road the one you are choosing. Or I don't know, you may have more self confidence than I do. Be open about what you want, inquire, not to a random on reddit but to people who know.",

Email it to agencies and talent companies. This agencies have headhunters but the chances of them finding you are the same as the chances of meeting the love of your life while waiting for the bus. You need to put yourself out there and put a big neon sign over your head that says \"I'm interested in being a model\".\n\nDon't despair, its a tough road the one you are choosing. Or I don't know, you may have more self confidence than I do. Be open about what you want, inquire, not to a random on reddit but to people who know.",

You need to put yourself out there and put a big neon sign over your head that says \"I'm interested in being a model\".\n\nDon't despair, its a tough road the one you are choosing.
