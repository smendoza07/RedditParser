    "body": "...well,  she\u2019s a unicorn. Which makes it pretty much impossible to find a replacement when the relationship comes to an end.\n\nedit:\n\nsince there is so much discussion about hotel/motel, etc going on, I would like to clarify 2 points:\n\n1. I am happily married (yes, there is such a thing) with limited time. It would not be the smartest move for me to bring a SB home.\n2. She was very new to the bowl, I was only the second person she ever met. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was in a SR with a woman 30 years younger than me. I found her profile on SA, but it took multiple attempts over the course of a month until she finally replied. She agreed to a meet and I gave her my burner #. We exchanged a few messages, trying to set a date, when she asked what attracted me to her. I said that I liked what she wrote in her profile and if she was only half as beautiful as her pics I would be in for a treat.\n\nShe texted me a few pics and I almost got into an accident. Wow and double-wow! So much more beautiful than what she had posted! Eventually we scheduled a date. In a motel, at her request. And she also told me what she expected for PPM, which was reasonable. Both these things raised several red flags, but I simply needed to meet her.\n\nI picked up a bottle of wine (she requested red), water, some fruit and waited for her in the room. She was 30 minutes late, but texted to let me know. Finally there was a knock, I opened the door and my heart skipped I don\u2019t know how many beats. Her pics didn\u2019t do her justice. She was one of those women you couldn\u2019t help staring at when she entered a restaurant or store. Stunning, confident, completely out of my league. Just perfect.\n\nI poured us some wine and we started talking. This went on for hours until she got undressed\u2026Eventually she left and I immediately texted her, thanking her for an incredible date and that I hope to see her again soon. But it would have to be in nicer hotels, since an exquisite woman like her deserves so much better than crappy motels.\n\nTo make this long story shorter, for over a year we met regularly, usually every 2 weeks, sometimes weekly, spending long afternoons and the occasional night together. In between she texted me, send me pics and videos, but never any nudes. Everything was perfect, we had endless talks, were very comfortable with each other, laughed a lot, the sex was simply amazing and we couldn\u2019t get enough of each other. When I came back from trips abroad, I brought gifts for her and chocolates for her family.\n\nThen Covid hit, the shutdown came and the trip we had planned together had to be cancelled. Instead my kids came home and the whole family quarantined for quite a while.\n\nI switched her to allowance to provide financial security. We met a few times to just go for walks, talk and enjoy each other\u2019s company. Her texts and pics became less frequent and finally she told me that she started dating someone. She still wanted to see me, but didn\u2019t feel comfortable accepting allowance and would rather go back to PPM.\n\nWhen hotels opened again we continued our intimate afternoons. They were less regular, but even more intimate, if that is  possible. Nevertheless, I felt that she was conflicted about seeing me and that her heart wasn\u2019t in it anymore.\n\nI knew I had to let her go. Her happiness is more important to me than the blissful hours we spent together. So I wrote her a long letter, thanked her for an incredible time, gave her a nice gift and wished her all the best with her boyfriend.\n\nWe still text occasionally, but the unicorn is mine no more. I miss her terribly.",

Most Tinder dates don't end in sex. Having sex at a M&G isn't wrong,but it leaves you vulnerable to scammers,johns and escorts. The OP got lucky which is why this story was labelled a unicorn.",

Take big risks and then cry a river when reality hits. Clearly there is a market for sugar escorting. No doubts.",
