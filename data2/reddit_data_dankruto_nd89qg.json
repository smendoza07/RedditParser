It was a very fair comparison. Not really sure what you're trying to prove btw.\n\nYes, Naruto's reserves are massive. That only supports my point of giving credit to Hashirama. Sasuke never had big reserves either, he simply leveled up in power with what he did have. Even the final battle, Naruto with half of Kurama and small chunks of the other bijuu, while only fighting defensively, still beat Sasuke who took majority of the beasts chakra plus the other half of Kurama too. Naruto is the best if that's what your point is fixated on, which I never disputed, but my point very much stands for Hashirama being absolutely insane since Naruto needed the jinchuriki to get to where he was.",

It\u2019s why Naruto tapped into Sage Mode and used KCM1, which he has a separate store of, rather than using Kurama\u2019s chakra for KCM2 during the majority of the attack against Juubi. Naruto and Kurama weren\u2019t even close to full reserves at this point. \n\nAnd my point about VOTE2 was the fact that Naruto matched Sasuke\u2019s stamina and chakra reserves despite Sasuke using the other Bijuu to power himself.\n\nHashirama is insanely strong with massive reserves, but framing it as Naruto needing Kurama to match his chakra when both Naruto and Kurama were explicitly far from full power at that point is flat out wrong.",

Sakura healed them both with her Byakugou, and then their own Chakra took over to regenerate from there with the help of the Sage mode as well.\n\nHashirama himself made that comparison, and being \"comparable to\" implies it was still less, so any marginal difference in reserves at that moment would still not surpass Hashirama (who wasn't brought back at full strength as I said). It only stands to reason Hashirama knew after his own reduced capacity and Naruto's, that he was comparing to potential capacity of them both instead of direct relation anyway. And I've already addressed the direct relation possibility anyway.\n\nYeah, I reinforced that point that Naruto > Sasuke by far.\n\n1) they weren't \"explicitly far from full power\" because at best, they were marginally weaker while still regenerating themselves in real time; 2) I'm not \"framing\" anything, as I'm being impartial, but you seem to not be being impartial but hey Naruto is the main protagonist so I get it; 3) you somehow acknowledge that both of their powers together are needed to compare to Hashirama (which is literally my point) and then also say Naruto doesn't need Kurama to match Hashirama?

Hashirama very clearly doesn\u2019t have that level of chakra.\n\nThe reason we can dismiss Hashirama comparing their full to his, is because he makes no mention of their reserves until *after* Naruto shares his chakra, at which point all he says is \u201cHe\u2019s got nearly as much chakra as me.\u201d There\u2019s no indication of adjustment for exhaustion.",

Ten tails *is* sage chakra. Like.. wut. \n\nThe extra storage *did* exist, because he had to separate that portion from Kuramas will.

But based on actually watching the show, no way Sasuke surpasses Hashiramas amount of chakra reserves. Sasuke is just extremely powerful with what he does have. Dude wont even use his sharingan much anymore. When Sasuke absorbed the beasts chakra, it also was only half of Kurama, but the difference that was so key was Kurama could keep molding chakra independently.

There\u2019s simply no evidence that he lost Hagoromo\u2019s power up, especially since Sasuke is still walking around with a Rinne-Sharingan.\n\nAs for the separate storage, you\u2019re making assumptions there. We know for a fact that Naruto can still use KCM1 while explicitly saying Kurama\u2019s out of chakra. So his extra store is separate.\n\nSakura directly says that Naruto isn\u2019t back to full power yet when he goes back to fight, but he only says he has \u201cenough\u201d. How much is that? No exact number, but if it\u2019s enough that Sakura feels the need to comment despite the massive reinforcements they just got, there\u2019s no way he\u2019s close to full.\n\nSensory doesn\u2019t let you see what isn\u2019t there. Hashirama can sense what they have in that moment. Nothing indicates he can sense what they might have at full. Also, we\u2019ve got no evidence that Hashirama even has sensory abilities. The only indication is Sage Mode, but Kabuto doesn\u2019t have Sensory abilities either, so it\u2019s probably like Frog Kumite, a technique of the Toad Style of Senjutsu.\n\nYou forget Indra\u2019s Arrow vs Tailed Beast Bomb. That\u2019s just raw power and chakra there. Sasuke himself, even Yin Sasuke as of VOTE, isn\u2019t Hashirama\u2019s equal in terms of chakra, but Yin Sasuke + Yang Kurama + the other 8 Bijuu is compared by Kurama to *Hagoromo* in terms of raw power.",

Literally right before Hashirama showed up, so like 2 chapters before he said this, Naruto was still unable to move due to his empty reserves, and Kurama even mentions that they didn\u2019t have their full strength back. It\u2019s why Naruto tapped into Sage Mode and used KCM1, which he has a separate store of, rather than using Kurama\u2019s chakra for KCM2 during the majority of the attack against Juubi. Naruto and Kurama weren\u2019t even close to full reserves at this point. \n\nAnd my point about VOTE2 was the fact that Naruto matched Sasuke\u2019s stamina and chakra reserves despite Sasuke using the other Bijuu to power himself.\n\nHashirama is insanely strong with massive reserves, but framing it as Naruto needing Kurama to match his chakra when both Naruto and Kurama were explicitly far from full power at that point is flat out wrong.",

Even gaining the 2nd half of Kurama in later years, he lost Hagoromos power and hasnt shown any of the other bijuu chakra either.\n\nThat \"extra storage\" didnt exist anymore because Naruto literally didnt need to siphon chakra against Kuramas will anymore.\n\nSage chakra is basically infinite and simply needs to be proportioned properly. Sakura healed them both with her Byakugou, and then their own Chakra took over to regenerate from there with the help of the Sage mode as well.\n\nHashirama himself made that comparison, and being \"comparable to\" implies it was still less, so any marginal difference in reserves at that moment would still not surpass Hashirama (who wasn't brought back at full strength as I said). It only stands to reason Hashirama knew after his own reduced capacity and Naruto's, that he was comparing to potential capacity of them both instead of direct relation anyway. And I've already addressed the direct relation possibility anyway.\n\nYeah, I reinforced that point that Naruto > Sasuke by far.\n\n1) they weren't \"explicitly far from full power\" because at best, they were marginally weaker while still regenerating themselves in real time; 2) I'm not \"framing\" anything, as I'm being impartial, but you seem to not be being impartial but hey Naruto is the main protagonist so I get it; 3) you somehow acknowledge that both of their powers together are needed to compare to Hashirama (which is literally my point) and then also say Naruto doesn't need Kurama to match Hashirama? That's a contradiction ya know?\n\nYou started a really strange debate here for seemingly no reason lol",

He still shows he can heal, still shows he can fly, still has other elements and so on. \n\nAnd yes, the extra storage does explicitly exist. Naruto separated Kurama\u2019s power, then Kurama regenerated his own strength by absorbing Naruto\u2019s chakra. B explicitly states this to be why Naruto should never use Shadow Clones while in KCM1.

Hashirama\u2019s statement predates her revealing it. Sage Chakra is very explicitly *not* infinite. Naruto has repeatedly dropped out of Sage Mode because he ran out of Sage Chakra. It\u2019s the entire reason Pain managed to pin him down in their fight.\n\nWhat does Hashirama know? He has no frame of reference for Naruto\u2019s fully rested strength, nor for Naruto+Kurama\u2019s strength. Hell, at this point he has literally infinite chakra anyway. His statement is entirely useless.\n\nWeakened Half Kurama+Weakened Naruto =< Slightly Weakened Hashirama. Our best frame of reference is VOTE.

He\u2019s no Itachi or Obito, he\u2019s got the largest non-Uzumaki/Senju reserves in the series)+Kurama+8 Bijuu in terms of chakra capacity. Hashirama very clearly doesn\u2019t have that level of chakra.\n\nThe reason we can dismiss Hashirama comparing their full to his, is because he makes no mention of their reserves until *after* Naruto shares his chakra, at which point all he says is \u201cHe\u2019s got nearly as much chakra as me.\u201d There\u2019s no indication of adjustment for exhaustion.",

Ten tails *is* sage chakra. Like.. wut. \n\nThe extra storage *did* exist, because he had to separate that portion from Kuramas will. Then Kurama said I wont fight you anymore so we can just access each other fully, and that's when that would naturally disappear.\n\nYou're right about the byakugo not being revealed yet, I got that detail mixed up, but she dropped down and said she would heal him to full and he said she did enough and jumped ahead iirc.\n\nSensory abilities are a thing, and he has his own level to compare as a base for anyone else since no one has surpassed him, til Naruto with Kurama.\n\nThis vote thing is the only thing I cant speak on because idk anything about it. But based on actually watching the show, no way Sasuke surpasses Hashiramas amount of chakra reserves. Sasuke is just extremely powerful with what he does have. Dude wont even use his sharingan much anymore. When Sasuke absorbed the beasts chakra, it also was only half of Kurama, but the difference that was so key was Kurama could keep molding chakra independently. That's what gave Naruto enough to match Sasuke in that final fight.\n\nYou literally brought the exhaustion point up lol I feel like you circle back to my point but still maintain your own for some reason.

There\u2019s simply no evidence that he lost Hagoromo\u2019s power up, especially since Sasuke is still walking around with a Rinne-Sharingan.\n\nAs for the separate storage, you\u2019re making assumptions there.

So his extra store is separate.\n\nSakura directly says that Naruto isn\u2019t back to full power yet when he goes back to fight, but he only says he has \u201cenough\u201d. How much is that? No exact number, but if it\u2019s enough that Sakura feels the need to comment despite the massive reinforcements they just got, there\u2019s no way he\u2019s close to full.\n\nSensory doesn\u2019t let you see what isn\u2019t there. Hashirama can sense what they have in that moment. Nothing indicates he can sense what they might have at full. Also, we\u2019ve got no evidence that Hashirama even has sensory abilities. The only indication is Sage Mode, but Kabuto doesn\u2019t have Sensory abilities either, so it\u2019s probably like Frog Kumite, a technique of the Toad Style of Senjutsu.\n\nYou forget Indra\u2019s Arrow vs Tailed Beast Bomb.

Sasuke never had big reserves either, he simply leveled up in power with what he did have. Even the final battle, Naruto with half of Kurama and small chunks of the other bijuu, while only fighting defensively, still beat Sasuke who took majority of the beasts chakra plus the other half of Kurama too. Naruto is the best if that's what your point is fixated on, which I never disputed, but my point very much stands for Hashirama being absolutely insane since Naruto needed the jinchuriki to get to where he was.",

It\u2019s why Naruto tapped into Sage Mode and used KCM1, which he has a separate store of, rather than using Kurama\u2019s chakra for KCM2 during the majority of the attack against Juubi.

Even gaining the 2nd half of Kurama in later years, he lost Hagoromos power and hasnt shown any of the other bijuu chakra either.\n\nThat \"extra storage\" didnt exist anymore because Naruto literally didnt need to siphon chakra against Kuramas will anymore.\n\nSage chakra is basically infinite and simply needs to be proportioned properly. Sakura healed them both with her Byakugou, and then their own Chakra took over to regenerate from there with the help of the Sage mode as well.\n\nHashirama himself made that comparison, and being \"comparable to\" implies it was still less, so any marginal difference in reserves at that moment would still not surpass Hashirama (who wasn't brought back at full strength as I said). It only stands to reason Hashirama knew after his own reduced capacity and Naruto's, that he was comparing to potential capacity of them both instead of direct relation anyway. And I've already addressed the direct relation possibility anyway.\n\nYeah, I reinforced that point that Naruto > Sasuke by far.\n\n1) they weren't \"explicitly far from full power\" because at best, they were marginally weaker while still regenerating themselves in real time; 2) I'm not \"framing\" anything, as I'm being impartial, but you seem to not be being impartial but hey Naruto is the main protagonist so I get it; 3) you somehow acknowledge that both of their powers together are needed to compare to Hashirama (which is literally my point) and then also say Naruto doesn't need Kurama to match Hashirama?

Ten tails *is* sage chakra. Like.. wut. \n\nThe extra storage *did* exist, because he had to separate that portion from Kuramas will. Then Kurama said I wont fight you anymore so we can just access each other fully, and that's when that would naturally disappear.\n\nYou're right about the byakugo not being revealed yet, I got that detail mixed up, but she dropped down and said she would heal him to full and he said she did enough and jumped ahead iirc.\n\nSensory abilities are a thing, and he has his own level to compare as a base for anyone else since no one has surpassed him, til Naruto with Kurama.\n\nThis vote thing is the only thing I cant speak on because idk anything about it. But based on actually watching the show, no way Sasuke surpasses Hashiramas amount of chakra reserves. Sasuke is just extremely powerful with what he does have. Dude wont even use his sharingan much anymore. When Sasuke absorbed the beasts chakra, it also was only half of Kurama, but the difference that was so key was Kurama could keep molding chakra independently.

And healing isn\u2019t something Kurama can do. He\u2019s never shown to be able to heal externally. The opposite in fact. We\u2019re outright told Naruto has to filter Kurama\u2019s chakra else it is actively poisonous to anyone else. \n\nNot to mention, Naruto flies against Momoshiki, and in the Last, and uses Magma Rasenshuriken in Boruto as well. There\u2019s simply no evidence that he lost Hagoromo\u2019s power up, especially since Sasuke is still walking around with a Rinne-Sharingan.\n\nAs for the separate storage, you\u2019re making assumptions there. We know for a fact that Naruto can still use KCM1 while explicitly saying Kurama\u2019s out of chakra. So his extra store is separate.\n\nSakura directly says that Naruto isn\u2019t back to full power yet when he goes back to fight, but he only says he has \u201cenough\u201d. How much is that? No exact number, but if it\u2019s enough that Sakura feels the need to comment despite the massive reinforcements they just got, there\u2019s no way he\u2019s close to full.\n\nSensory doesn\u2019t let you see what isn\u2019t there. Hashirama can sense what they have in that moment. Nothing indicates he can sense what they might have at full. Also, we\u2019ve got no evidence that Hashirama even has sensory abilities. The only indication is Sage Mode, but Kabuto doesn\u2019t have Sensory abilities either, so it\u2019s probably like Frog Kumite, a technique of the Toad Style of Senjutsu.\n\nYou forget Indra\u2019s Arrow vs Tailed Beast Bomb. That\u2019s just raw power and chakra there. Sasuke himself, even Yin Sasuke as of VOTE, isn\u2019t Hashirama\u2019s equal in terms of chakra, but Yin Sasuke + Yang Kurama + the other 8 Bijuu is compared by Kurama to *Hagoromo* in terms of raw power.",

It was a very fair comparison. Not really sure what you're trying to prove btw.\n\nYes, Naruto's reserves are massive. That only supports my point of giving credit to Hashirama. Sasuke never had big reserves either, he simply leveled up in power with what he did have. Even the final battle, Naruto with half of Kurama and small chunks of the other bijuu, while only fighting defensively, still beat Sasuke who took majority of the beasts chakra plus the other half of Kurama too. Naruto is the best if that's what your point is fixated on, which I never disputed, but my point very much stands for Hashirama being absolutely insane since Naruto needed the jinchuriki to get to where he was.",

Even gaining the 2nd half of Kurama in later years, he lost Hagoromos power and hasnt shown any of the other bijuu chakra either.\n\nThat \"extra storage\" didnt exist anymore because Naruto literally didnt need to siphon chakra against Kuramas will anymore.\n\nSage chakra is basically infinite and simply needs to be proportioned properly. Sakura healed them both with her Byakugou, and then their own Chakra took over to regenerate from there with the help of the Sage mode as well.\n\nHashirama himself made that comparison, and being \"comparable to\" implies it was still less, so any marginal difference in reserves at that moment would still not surpass Hashirama (who wasn't brought back at full strength as I said). It only stands to reason Hashirama knew after his own reduced capacity and Naruto's, that he was comparing to potential capacity of them both instead of direct relation anyway. And I've already addressed the direct relation possibility anyway.\n\nYeah, I reinforced that point that Naruto > Sasuke by far.\n\n1) they weren't \"explicitly far from full power\" because at best, they were marginally weaker while still regenerating themselves in real time; 2) I'm not \"framing\" anything, as I'm being impartial, but you seem to not be being impartial but hey Naruto is the main protagonist so I get it; 3) you somehow acknowledge that both of their powers together are needed to compare to Hashirama (which is literally my point) and then also say Naruto doesn't need Kurama to match Hashirama?

His statement is entirely useless.\n\nWeakened Half Kurama+Weakened Naruto =< Slightly Weakened Hashirama. Our best frame of reference is VOTE.

Hashirama very clearly doesn\u2019t have that level of chakra.\n\nThe reason we can dismiss Hashirama comparing their full to his, is because he makes no mention of their reserves until *after* Naruto shares his chakra, at which point all he says is \u201cHe\u2019s got nearly as much chakra as me.\u201d There\u2019s no indication of adjustment for exhaustion.",

Ten tails *is* sage chakra. Like.. wut. \n\nThe extra storage *did* exist, because he had to separate that portion from Kuramas will. Then Kurama said I wont fight you anymore so we can just access each other fully, and that's when that would naturally disappear.\n\nYou're right about the byakugo not being revealed yet, I got that detail mixed up, but she dropped down and said she would heal him to full and he said she did enough and jumped ahead iirc.\n\nSensory abilities are a thing, and he has his own level to compare as a base for anyone else since no one has surpassed him, til Naruto with Kurama.\n\nThis vote thing is the only thing I cant speak on because idk anything about it. But based on actually watching the show, no way Sasuke surpasses Hashiramas amount of chakra reserves. Sasuke is just extremely powerful with what he does have. Dude wont even use his sharingan much anymore. When Sasuke absorbed the beasts chakra, it also was only half of Kurama, but the difference that was so key was Kurama could keep molding chakra independently. That's what gave Naruto enough to match Sasuke in that final fight.\n\nYou literally brought the exhaustion point up lol I feel like you circle back to my point but still maintain your own for some reason.

It was a very fair comparison. Not really sure what you're trying to prove btw.\n\nYes, Naruto's reserves are massive. That only supports my point of giving credit to Hashirama. Sasuke never had big reserves either, he simply leveled up in power with what he did have. Even the final battle, Naruto with half of Kurama and small chunks of the other bijuu, while only fighting defensively, still beat Sasuke who took majority of the beasts chakra plus the other half of Kurama too. Naruto is the best if that's what your point is fixated on, which I never disputed, but my point very much stands for Hashirama being absolutely insane since Naruto needed the jinchuriki to get to where he was.",

Literally right before Hashirama showed up, so like 2 chapters before he said this, Naruto was still unable to move due to his empty reserves, and Kurama even mentions that they didn\u2019t have their full strength back. It\u2019s why Naruto tapped into Sage Mode and used KCM1, which he has a separate store of, rather than using Kurama\u2019s chakra for KCM2 during the majority of the attack against Juubi. Naruto and Kurama weren\u2019t even close to full reserves at this point. \n\nAnd my point about VOTE2 was the fact that Naruto matched Sasuke\u2019s stamina and chakra reserves despite Sasuke using the other Bijuu to power himself.\n\nHashirama is insanely strong with massive reserves, but framing it as Naruto needing Kurama to match his chakra when both Naruto and Kurama were explicitly far from full power at that point is flat out wrong.",

Even gaining the 2nd half of Kurama in later years, he lost Hagoromos power and hasnt shown any of the other bijuu chakra either.\n\nThat \"extra storage\" didnt exist anymore because Naruto literally didnt need to siphon chakra against Kuramas will anymore.\n\nSage chakra is basically infinite and simply needs to be proportioned properly. Sakura healed them both with her Byakugou, and then their own Chakra took over to regenerate from there with the help of the Sage mode as well.\n\nHashirama himself made that comparison, and being \"comparable to\" implies it was still less, so any marginal difference in reserves at that moment would still not surpass Hashirama (who wasn't brought back at full strength as I said). It only stands to reason Hashirama knew after his own reduced capacity and Naruto's, that he was comparing to potential capacity of them both instead of direct relation anyway. And I've already addressed the direct relation possibility anyway.\n\nYeah, I reinforced that point that Naruto > Sasuke by far.\n\n1) they weren't \"explicitly far from full power\" because at best, they were marginally weaker while still regenerating themselves in real time; 2) I'm not \"framing\" anything, as I'm being impartial, but you seem to not be being impartial but hey Naruto is the main protagonist so I get it; 3) you somehow acknowledge that both of their powers together are needed to compare to Hashirama (which is literally my point) and then also say Naruto doesn't need Kurama to match Hashirama?

Then it\u2019s the Last, who is stronger in BSM then War Arc SPSM Naruto is. Then it\u2019s 17 year old Naruto. \n\nAfter all, Naruto is still Sasuke\u2019s equal and explicitly, the Last Sasuke is Kaguya+ Level. \n\nNaruto didn\u2019t lose Hagoromo\u2019s power either. He still shows he can heal, still shows he can fly, still has other elements and so on. \n\nAnd yes, the extra storage does explicitly exist. Naruto separated Kurama\u2019s power, then Kurama regenerated his own strength by absorbing Naruto\u2019s chakra. B explicitly states this to be why Naruto should never use Shadow Clones while in KCM1. Hell, Naruto was literally in KCM1 while explaining to Sai that he flat out couldn\u2019t give out Kurama\u2019s chakra because Kurama didn\u2019t have any left.\n\nSakura didn\u2019t show her Byakugo at that point. Hashirama\u2019s statement predates her revealing it. Sage Chakra is very explicitly *not* infinite. Naruto has repeatedly dropped out of Sage Mode because he ran out of Sage Chakra. It\u2019s the entire reason Pain managed to pin him down in their fight.\n\nWhat does Hashirama know? He has no frame of reference for Naruto\u2019s fully rested strength, nor for Naruto+Kurama\u2019s strength. Hell, at this point he has literally infinite chakra anyway. His statement is entirely useless.\n\nWeakened Half Kurama+Weakened Naruto =< Slightly Weakened Hashirama. Our best frame of reference is VOTE. In which Naruto+Kuramax1.5=Sasuke (who canonically has insanely massive chakra reserves btw. He\u2019s no Itachi or Obito, he\u2019s got the largest non-Uzumaki/Senju reserves in the series)+Kurama+8 Bijuu in terms of chakra capacity. Hashirama very clearly doesn\u2019t have that level of chakra.\n\nThe reason we can dismiss Hashirama comparing their full to his, is because he makes no mention of their reserves until *after* Naruto shares his chakra, at which point all he says is \u201cHe\u2019s got nearly as much chakra as me.\u201d There\u2019s no indication of adjustment for exhaustion.",

He hasnt done any of those things but healing, which has always been a Kurama power. Naruto even said to Kurama that they're out of practice, but it *is* full Kurama which is still too monstrous on its own, albeit not as strong Otsusuki sage chakra.\n\nSage mode only dropped because he didnt have time to keep absorbing it lmao that doesnt make it not infinite, and when you have a partner (kurama or ma/pa frogs) to keep it going, it's as infinite as long as your own chakra is there, which he had oceans of. Ten tails *is* sage chakra. Like.. wut. \n\nThe extra storage *did* exist, because he had to separate that portion from Kuramas will. Then Kurama said I wont fight you anymore so we can just access each other fully, and that's when that would naturally disappear.\n\nYou're right about the byakugo not being revealed yet, I got that detail mixed up, but she dropped down and said she would heal him to full and he said she did enough and jumped ahead iirc.\n\nSensory abilities are a thing, and he has his own level to compare as a base for anyone else since no one has surpassed him, til Naruto with Kurama.\n\nThis vote thing is the only thing I cant speak on because idk anything about it. But based on actually watching the show, no way Sasuke surpasses Hashiramas amount of chakra reserves. Sasuke is just extremely powerful with what he does have. Dude wont even use his sharingan much anymore. When Sasuke absorbed the beasts chakra, it also was only half of Kurama, but the difference that was so key was Kurama could keep molding chakra independently. That's what gave Naruto enough to match Sasuke in that final fight.\n\nYou literally brought the exhaustion point up lol I feel like you circle back to my point but still maintain your own for some reason. But I do have to get to bed, so thanks for the nights entertainment and I hope you have a good night! I did enjoy it",

He\u2019s never shown to be able to heal externally. The opposite in fact. We\u2019re outright told Naruto has to filter Kurama\u2019s chakra else it is actively poisonous to anyone else. \n\nNot to mention, Naruto flies against Momoshiki, and in the Last, and uses Magma Rasenshuriken in Boruto as well. There\u2019s simply no evidence that he lost Hagoromo\u2019s power up, especially since Sasuke is still walking around with a Rinne-Sharingan.\n\nAs for the separate storage, you\u2019re making assumptions there. We know for a fact that Naruto can still use KCM1 while explicitly saying Kurama\u2019s out of chakra. So his extra store is separate.\n\nSakura directly says that Naruto isn\u2019t back to full power yet when he goes back to fight, but he only says he has \u201cenough\u201d. How much is that? No exact number, but if it\u2019s enough that Sakura feels the need to comment despite the massive reinforcements they just got, there\u2019s no way he\u2019s close to full.\n\nSensory doesn\u2019t let you see what isn\u2019t there. Hashirama can sense what they have in that moment. Nothing indicates he can sense what they might have at full. Also, we\u2019ve got no evidence that Hashirama even has sensory abilities. The only indication is Sage Mode, but Kabuto doesn\u2019t have Sensory abilities either, so it\u2019s probably like Frog Kumite, a technique of the Toad Style of Senjutsu.\n\nYou forget Indra\u2019s Arrow vs Tailed Beast Bomb. That\u2019s just raw power and chakra there. Sasuke himself, even Yin Sasuke as of VOTE, isn\u2019t Hashirama\u2019s equal in terms of chakra, but Yin Sasuke + Yang Kurama + the other 8 Bijuu is compared by Kurama to *Hagoromo* in terms of raw power.",

It was a very fair comparison. Not really sure what you're trying to prove btw.\n\nYes, Naruto's reserves are massive. That only supports my point of giving credit to Hashirama. Sasuke never had big reserves either, he simply leveled up in power with what he did have. Even the final battle, Naruto with half of Kurama and small chunks of the other bijuu, while only fighting defensively, still beat Sasuke who took majority of the beasts chakra plus the other half of Kurama too. Naruto is the best if that's what your point is fixated on, which I never disputed, but my point very much stands for Hashirama being absolutely insane since Naruto needed the jinchuriki to get to where he was.",

Literally right before Hashirama showed up, so like 2 chapters before he said this, Naruto was still unable to move due to his empty reserves, and Kurama even mentions that they didn\u2019t have their full strength back. It\u2019s why Naruto tapped into Sage Mode and used KCM1, which he has a separate store of, rather than using Kurama\u2019s chakra for KCM2 during the majority of the attack against Juubi. Naruto and Kurama weren\u2019t even close to full reserves at this point. \n\nAnd my point about VOTE2 was the fact that Naruto matched Sasuke\u2019s stamina and chakra reserves despite Sasuke using the other Bijuu to power himself.\n\nHashirama is insanely strong with massive reserves, but framing it as Naruto needing Kurama to match his chakra when both Naruto and Kurama were explicitly far from full power at that point is flat out wrong.",

Even gaining the 2nd half of Kurama in later years, he lost Hagoromos power and hasnt shown any of the other bijuu chakra either.\n\nThat \"extra storage\" didnt exist anymore because Naruto literally didnt need to siphon chakra against Kuramas will anymore.\n\nSage chakra is basically infinite and simply needs to be proportioned properly. Sakura healed them both with her Byakugou, and then their own Chakra took over to regenerate from there with the help of the Sage mode as well.\n\nHashirama himself made that comparison, and being \"comparable to\" implies it was still less, so any marginal difference in reserves at that moment would still not surpass Hashirama (who wasn't brought back at full strength as I said). It only stands to reason Hashirama knew after his own reduced capacity and Naruto's, that he was comparing to potential capacity of them both instead of direct relation anyway. And I've already addressed the direct relation possibility anyway.\n\nYeah, I reinforced that point that Naruto > Sasuke by far.\n\n1) they weren't \"explicitly far from full power\" because at best, they were marginally weaker while still regenerating themselves in real time; 2) I'm not \"framing\" anything, as I'm being impartial, but you seem to not be being impartial but hey Naruto is the main protagonist so I get it; 3) you somehow acknowledge that both of their powers together are needed to compare to Hashirama (which is literally my point) and then also say Naruto doesn't need Kurama to match Hashirama? That's a contradiction ya know?\n\nYou started a really strange debate here for seemingly no reason lol",

Hashirama\u2019s statement predates her revealing it. Sage Chakra is very explicitly *not* infinite. Naruto has repeatedly dropped out of Sage Mode because he ran out of Sage Chakra. It\u2019s the entire reason Pain managed to pin him down in their fight.\n\nWhat does Hashirama know? He has no frame of reference for Naruto\u2019s fully rested strength, nor for Naruto+Kurama\u2019s strength. Hell, at this point he has literally infinite chakra anyway. His statement is entirely useless.\n\nWeakened Half Kurama+Weakened Naruto =< Slightly Weakened Hashirama. Our best frame of reference is VOTE.

Hashirama very clearly doesn\u2019t have that level of chakra.\n\nThe reason we can dismiss Hashirama comparing their full to his, is because he makes no mention of their reserves until *after* Naruto shares his chakra, at which point all he says is \u201cHe\u2019s got nearly as much chakra as me.\u201d There\u2019s no indication of adjustment for exhaustion.",

Ten tails *is* sage chakra. Like.. wut. \n\nThe extra storage *did* exist, because he had to separate that portion from Kuramas will. Then Kurama said I wont fight you anymore so we can just access each other fully, and that's when that would naturally disappear.\n\nYou're right about the byakugo not being revealed yet, I got that detail mixed up, but she dropped down and said she would heal him to full and he said she did enough and jumped ahead iirc.\n\nSensory abilities are a thing, and he has his own level to compare as a base for anyone else since no one has surpassed him, til Naruto with Kurama.\n\nThis vote thing is the only thing I cant speak on because idk anything about it. But based on actually watching the show, no way Sasuke surpasses Hashiramas amount of chakra reserves. Sasuke is just extremely powerful with what he does have. Dude wont even use his sharingan much anymore. When Sasuke absorbed the beasts chakra, it also was only half of Kurama, but the difference that was so key was Kurama could keep molding chakra independently. That's what gave Naruto enough to match Sasuke in that final fight.\n\nYou literally brought the exhaustion point up lol I feel like you circle back to my point but still maintain your own for some reason.

No exact number, but if it\u2019s enough that Sakura feels the need to comment despite the massive reinforcements they just got, there\u2019s no way he\u2019s close to full.\n\nSensory doesn\u2019t let you see what isn\u2019t there.

Sasuke never had big reserves either, he simply leveled up in power with what he did have. Even the final battle, Naruto with half of Kurama and small chunks of the other bijuu, while only fighting defensively, still beat Sasuke who took majority of the beasts chakra plus the other half of Kurama too.

Sakura healed them both with her Byakugou, and then their own Chakra took over to regenerate from there with the help of the Sage mode as well.\n\nHashirama himself made that comparison, and being \"comparable to\" implies it was still less, so any marginal difference in reserves at that moment would still not surpass Hashirama (who wasn't brought back at full strength as I said). It only stands to reason Hashirama knew after his own reduced capacity and Naruto's, that he was comparing to potential capacity of them both instead of direct relation anyway. And I've already addressed the direct relation possibility anyway.\n\nYeah, I reinforced that point that Naruto > Sasuke by far.\n\n1) they weren't \"explicitly far from full power\" because at best, they were marginally weaker while still regenerating themselves in real time; 2) I'm not \"framing\" anything, as I'm being impartial, but you seem to not be being impartial but hey Naruto is the main protagonist so I get it; 3) you somehow acknowledge that both of their powers together are needed to compare to Hashirama (which is literally my point) and then also say Naruto doesn't need Kurama to match Hashirama?

Hashirama very clearly doesn\u2019t have that level of chakra.\n\nThe reason we can dismiss Hashirama comparing their full to his, is because he makes no mention of their reserves until *after* Naruto shares his chakra, at which point all he says is \u201cHe\u2019s got nearly as much chakra as me.\u201d There\u2019s no indication of adjustment for exhaustion.",

It was a very fair comparison. Not really sure what you're trying to prove btw.\n\nYes, Naruto's reserves are massive. That only supports my point of giving credit to Hashirama. Sasuke never had big reserves either, he simply leveled up in power with what he did have. Even the final battle, Naruto with half of Kurama and small chunks of the other bijuu, while only fighting defensively, still beat Sasuke who took majority of the beasts chakra plus the other half of Kurama too. Naruto is the best if that's what your point is fixated on, which I never disputed, but my point very much stands for Hashirama being absolutely insane since Naruto needed the jinchuriki to get to where he was.",

It\u2019s why Naruto tapped into Sage Mode and used KCM1, which he has a separate store of, rather than using Kurama\u2019s chakra for KCM2 during the majority of the attack against Juubi.

Even gaining the 2nd half of Kurama in later years, he lost Hagoromos power and hasnt shown any of the other bijuu chakra either.\n\nThat \"extra storage\" didnt exist anymore because Naruto literally didnt need to siphon chakra against Kuramas will anymore.\n\nSage chakra is basically infinite and simply needs to be proportioned properly. Sakura healed them both with her Byakugou, and then their own Chakra took over to regenerate from there with the help of the Sage mode as well.\n\nHashirama himself made that comparison, and being \"comparable to\" implies it was still less, so any marginal difference in reserves at that moment would still not surpass Hashirama (who wasn't brought back at full strength as I said). It only stands to reason Hashirama knew after his own reduced capacity and Naruto's, that he was comparing to potential capacity of them both instead of direct relation anyway. And I've already addressed the direct relation possibility anyway.\n\nYeah, I reinforced that point that Naruto > Sasuke by far.\n\n1) they weren't \"explicitly far from full power\" because at best, they were marginally weaker while still regenerating themselves in real time; 2) I'm not \"framing\" anything, as I'm being impartial, but you seem to not be being impartial but hey Naruto is the main protagonist so I get it; 3) you somehow acknowledge that both of their powers together are needed to compare to Hashirama (which is literally my point) and then also say Naruto doesn't need Kurama to match Hashirama?

He still shows he can heal, still shows he can fly, still has other elements and so on. \n\nAnd yes, the extra storage does explicitly exist. Naruto separated Kurama\u2019s power, then Kurama regenerated his own strength by absorbing Naruto\u2019s chakra. B explicitly states this to be why Naruto should never use Shadow Clones while in KCM1.

Hashirama\u2019s statement predates her revealing it. Sage Chakra is very explicitly *not* infinite. Naruto has repeatedly dropped out of Sage Mode because he ran out of Sage Chakra. It\u2019s the entire reason Pain managed to pin him down in their fight.\n\nWhat does Hashirama know?

Hashirama very clearly doesn\u2019t have that level of chakra.\n\nThe reason we can dismiss Hashirama comparing their full to his, is because he makes no mention of their reserves until *after* Naruto shares his chakra, at which point all he says is \u201cHe\u2019s got nearly as much chakra as me.\u201d There\u2019s no indication of adjustment for exhaustion.",

Ten tails *is* sage chakra. Like.. wut. \n\nThe extra storage *did* exist, because he had to separate that portion from Kuramas will.

But based on actually watching the show, no way Sasuke surpasses Hashiramas amount of chakra reserves. Sasuke is just extremely powerful with what he does have. Dude wont even use his sharingan much anymore. When Sasuke absorbed the beasts chakra, it also was only half of Kurama, but the difference that was so key was Kurama could keep molding chakra independently.

It was a very fair comparison. Not really sure what you're trying to prove btw.\n\nYes, Naruto's reserves are massive. That only supports my point of giving credit to Hashirama. Sasuke never had big reserves either, he simply leveled up in power with what he did have. Even the final battle, Naruto with half of Kurama and small chunks of the other bijuu, while only fighting defensively, still beat Sasuke who took majority of the beasts chakra plus the other half of Kurama too. Naruto is the best if that's what your point is fixated on, which I never disputed, but my point very much stands for Hashirama being absolutely insane since Naruto needed the jinchuriki to get to where he was.",

Sakura healed them both with her Byakugou, and then their own Chakra took over to regenerate from there with the help of the Sage mode as well.\n\nHashirama himself made that comparison, and being \"comparable to\" implies it was still less, so any marginal difference in reserves at that moment would still not surpass Hashirama (who wasn't brought back at full strength as I said). It only stands to reason Hashirama knew after his own reduced capacity and Naruto's, that he was comparing to potential capacity of them both instead of direct relation anyway. And I've already addressed the direct relation possibility anyway.\n\nYeah, I reinforced that point that Naruto > Sasuke by far.\n\n1) they weren't \"explicitly far from full power\" because at best, they were marginally weaker while still regenerating themselves in real time; 2) I'm not \"framing\" anything, as I'm being impartial, but you seem to not be being impartial but hey Naruto is the main protagonist so I get it; 3) you somehow acknowledge that both of their powers together are needed to compare to Hashirama (which is literally my point) and then also say Naruto doesn't need Kurama to match Hashirama?

Hashirama very clearly doesn\u2019t have that level of chakra.\n\nThe reason we can dismiss Hashirama comparing their full to his, is because he makes no mention of their reserves until *after* Naruto shares his chakra, at which point all he says is \u201cHe\u2019s got nearly as much chakra as me.\u201d There\u2019s no indication of adjustment for exhaustion.",

Ten tails *is* sage chakra. Like.. wut. \n\nThe extra storage *did* exist, because he had to separate that portion from Kuramas will.

It\u2019s why Naruto tapped into Sage Mode and used KCM1, which he has a separate store of, rather than using Kurama\u2019s chakra for KCM2 during the majority of the attack against Juubi.

Even gaining the 2nd half of Kurama in later years, he lost Hagoromos power and hasnt shown any of the other bijuu chakra either.\n\nThat \"extra storage\" didnt exist anymore because Naruto literally didnt need to siphon chakra against Kuramas will anymore.\n\nSage chakra is basically infinite and simply needs to be proportioned properly. Sakura healed them both with her Byakugou, and then their own Chakra took over to regenerate from there with the help of the Sage mode as well.\n\nHashirama himself made that comparison, and being \"comparable to\" implies it was still less, so any marginal difference in reserves at that moment would still not surpass Hashirama (who wasn't brought back at full strength as I said). It only stands to reason Hashirama knew after his own reduced capacity and Naruto's, that he was comparing to potential capacity of them both instead of direct relation anyway. And I've already addressed the direct relation possibility anyway.\n\nYeah, I reinforced that point that Naruto > Sasuke by far.\n\n1) they weren't \"explicitly far from full power\" because at best, they were marginally weaker while still regenerating themselves in real time; 2) I'm not \"framing\" anything, as I'm being impartial, but you seem to not be being impartial but hey Naruto is the main protagonist so I get it; 3) you somehow acknowledge that both of their powers together are needed to compare to Hashirama (which is literally my point) and then also say Naruto doesn't need Kurama to match Hashirama?

He still shows he can heal, still shows he can fly, still has other elements and so on. \n\nAnd yes, the extra storage does explicitly exist. Naruto separated Kurama\u2019s power, then Kurama regenerated his own strength by absorbing Naruto\u2019s chakra. B explicitly states this to be why Naruto should never use Shadow Clones while in KCM1. Hell, Naruto was literally in KCM1 while explaining to Sai that he flat out couldn\u2019t give out Kurama\u2019s chakra because Kurama didn\u2019t have any left.\n\nSakura didn\u2019t show her Byakugo at that point. Hashirama\u2019s statement predates her revealing it. Sage Chakra is very explicitly *not* infinite. Naruto has repeatedly dropped out of Sage Mode because he ran out of Sage Chakra. It\u2019s the entire reason Pain managed to pin him down in their fight.\n\nWhat does Hashirama know? He has no frame of reference for Naruto\u2019s fully rested strength, nor for Naruto+Kurama\u2019s strength. Hell, at this point he has literally infinite chakra anyway. His statement is entirely useless.\n\nWeakened Half Kurama+Weakened Naruto =< Slightly Weakened Hashirama. Our best frame of reference is VOTE. In which Naruto+Kuramax1.5=Sasuke (who canonically has insanely massive chakra reserves btw. He\u2019s no Itachi or Obito, he\u2019s got the largest non-Uzumaki/Senju reserves in the series)+Kurama+8 Bijuu in terms of chakra capacity. Hashirama very clearly doesn\u2019t have that level of chakra.\n\nThe reason we can dismiss Hashirama comparing their full to his, is because he makes no mention of their reserves until *after* Naruto shares his chakra, at which point all he says is \u201cHe\u2019s got nearly as much chakra as me.\u201d There\u2019s no indication of adjustment for exhaustion.",

Ten tails *is* sage chakra. Like.. wut. \n\nThe extra storage *did* exist, because he had to separate that portion from Kuramas will. Then Kurama said I wont fight you anymore so we can just access each other fully, and that's when that would naturally disappear.\n\nYou're right about the byakugo not being revealed yet, I got that detail mixed up, but she dropped down and said she would heal him to full and he said she did enough and jumped ahead iirc.\n\nSensory abilities are a thing, and he has his own level to compare as a base for anyone else since no one has surpassed him, til Naruto with Kurama.\n\nThis vote thing is the only thing I cant speak on because idk anything about it. But based on actually watching the show, no way Sasuke surpasses Hashiramas amount of chakra reserves. Sasuke is just extremely powerful with what he does have. Dude wont even use his sharingan much anymore. When Sasuke absorbed the beasts chakra, it also was only half of Kurama, but the difference that was so key was Kurama could keep molding chakra independently. That's what gave Naruto enough to match Sasuke in that final fight.\n\nYou literally brought the exhaustion point up lol I feel like you circle back to my point but still maintain your own for some reason.

He\u2019s never shown to be able to heal externally. The opposite in fact. We\u2019re outright told Naruto has to filter Kurama\u2019s chakra else it is actively poisonous to anyone else. \n\nNot to mention, Naruto flies against Momoshiki, and in the Last, and uses Magma Rasenshuriken in Boruto as well. There\u2019s simply no evidence that he lost Hagoromo\u2019s power up, especially since Sasuke is still walking around with a Rinne-Sharingan.\n\nAs for the separate storage, you\u2019re making assumptions there. We know for a fact that Naruto can still use KCM1 while explicitly saying Kurama\u2019s out of chakra. So his extra store is separate.\n\nSakura directly says that Naruto isn\u2019t back to full power yet when he goes back to fight, but he only says he has \u201cenough\u201d. How much is that? No exact number, but if it\u2019s enough that Sakura feels the need to comment despite the massive reinforcements they just got, there\u2019s no way he\u2019s close to full.\n\nSensory doesn\u2019t let you see what isn\u2019t there. Hashirama can sense what they have in that moment. Nothing indicates he can sense what they might have at full. Also, we\u2019ve got no evidence that Hashirama even has sensory abilities. The only indication is Sage Mode, but Kabuto doesn\u2019t have Sensory abilities either, so it\u2019s probably like Frog Kumite, a technique of the Toad Style of Senjutsu.\n\nYou forget Indra\u2019s Arrow vs Tailed Beast Bomb. That\u2019s just raw power and chakra there. Sasuke himself, even Yin Sasuke as of VOTE, isn\u2019t Hashirama\u2019s equal in terms of chakra, but Yin Sasuke + Yang Kurama + the other 8 Bijuu is compared by Kurama to *Hagoromo* in terms of raw power.",

Naruto is the best if that's what your point is fixated on, which I never disputed, but my point very much stands for Hashirama being absolutely insane since Naruto needed the jinchuriki to get to where he was.",

He\u2019s never shown to be able to heal externally. The opposite in fact. We\u2019re outright told Naruto has to filter Kurama\u2019s chakra else it is actively poisonous to anyone else. \n\nNot to mention, Naruto flies against Momoshiki, and in the Last, and uses Magma Rasenshuriken in Boruto as well. There\u2019s simply no evidence that he lost Hagoromo\u2019s power up, especially since Sasuke is still walking around with a Rinne-Sharingan.\n\nAs for the separate storage, you\u2019re making assumptions there. We know for a fact that Naruto can still use KCM1 while explicitly saying Kurama\u2019s out of chakra. So his extra store is separate.\n\nSakura directly says that Naruto isn\u2019t back to full power yet when he goes back to fight, but he only says he has \u201cenough\u201d. How much is that? No exact number, but if it\u2019s enough that Sakura feels the need to comment despite the massive reinforcements they just got, there\u2019s no way he\u2019s close to full.\n\nSensory doesn\u2019t let you see what isn\u2019t there. Hashirama can sense what they have in that moment. Nothing indicates he can sense what they might have at full. Also, we\u2019ve got no evidence that Hashirama even has sensory abilities. The only indication is Sage Mode, but Kabuto doesn\u2019t have Sensory abilities either, so it\u2019s probably like Frog Kumite, a technique of the Toad Style of Senjutsu.\n\nYou forget Indra\u2019s Arrow vs Tailed Beast Bomb. That\u2019s just raw power and chakra there. Sasuke himself, even Yin Sasuke as of VOTE, isn\u2019t Hashirama\u2019s equal in terms of chakra, but Yin Sasuke + Yang Kurama + the other 8 Bijuu is compared by Kurama to *Hagoromo* in terms of raw power.",

Even gaining the 2nd half of Kurama in later years, he lost Hagoromos power and hasnt shown any of the other bijuu chakra either.\n\nThat \"extra storage\" didnt exist anymore because Naruto literally didnt need to siphon chakra against Kuramas will anymore.\n\nSage chakra is basically infinite and simply needs to be proportioned properly. Sakura healed them both with her Byakugou, and then their own Chakra took over to regenerate from there with the help of the Sage mode as well.\n\nHashirama himself made that comparison, and being \"comparable to\" implies it was still less, so any marginal difference in reserves at that moment would still not surpass Hashirama (who wasn't brought back at full strength as I said). It only stands to reason Hashirama knew after his own reduced capacity and Naruto's, that he was comparing to potential capacity of them both instead of direct relation anyway. And I've already addressed the direct relation possibility anyway.\n\nYeah, I reinforced that point that Naruto > Sasuke by far.\n\n1) they weren't \"explicitly far from full power\" because at best, they were marginally weaker while still regenerating themselves in real time; 2) I'm not \"framing\" anything, as I'm being impartial, but you seem to not be being impartial but hey Naruto is the main protagonist so I get it; 3) you somehow acknowledge that both of their powers together are needed to compare to Hashirama (which is literally my point) and then also say Naruto doesn't need Kurama to match Hashirama? That's a contradiction ya know?\n\nYou started a really strange debate here for seemingly no reason lol",

            "body": "Do you read Boruto? He hasnt done any of those things but healing, which has always been a Kurama power. Naruto even said to Kurama that they're out of practice, but it *is* full Kurama which is still too monstrous on its own, albeit not as strong Otsusuki sage chakra.\n\nSage mode only dropped because he didnt have time to keep absorbing it lmao that doesnt make it not infinite, and when you have a partner (kurama or ma/pa frogs) to keep it going, it's as infinite as long as your own chakra is there, which he had oceans of. Ten tails *is* sage chakra. Like.. wut. \n\nThe extra storage *did* exist, because he had to separate that portion from Kuramas will. Then Kurama said I wont fight you anymore so we can just access each other fully, and that's when that would naturally disappear.\n\nYou're right about the byakugo not being revealed yet, I got that detail mixed up, but she dropped down and said she would heal him to full and he said she did enough and jumped ahead iirc.\n\nSensory abilities are a thing, and he has his own level to compare as a base for anyone else since no one has surpassed him, til Naruto with Kurama.\n\nThis vote thing is the only thing I cant speak on because idk anything about it. But based on actually watching the show, no way Sasuke surpasses Hashiramas amount of chakra reserves. Sasuke is just extremely powerful with what he does have. Dude wont even use his sharingan much anymore. When Sasuke absorbed the beasts chakra, it also was only half of Kurama, but the difference that was so key was Kurama could keep molding chakra independently. That's what gave Naruto enough to match Sasuke in that final fight.\n\nYou literally brought the exhaustion point up lol I feel like you circle back to my point but still maintain your own for some reason. But I do have to get to bed, so thanks for the nights entertainment and I hope you have a good night! I did enjoy it",

Sasuke himself, even Yin Sasuke as of VOTE, isn\u2019t Hashirama\u2019s equal in terms of chakra, but Yin Sasuke + Yang Kurama + the other 8 Bijuu is compared by Kurama to *Hagoromo* in terms of raw power.",
