Every villain in this story has a sob story, sometimes it's a mirror image of Naruto (obito, gaara). After a while these sob stories get tiresome, not that they aren't good, just a bit repetitive.\n\nThen comes a guy that basically said, \"but why not?\" To these forbidden jutsus and became the OG. Plus he was genuinely scary in the first part of Naruto especially during the chunin exams.",
