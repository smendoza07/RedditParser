Danzo, like Hiruzen, was a student of Tobirama. Kakashi was a student of Minato and essentially a stop-gap until they could get Naruto (son of Minato, student of Kakashi and Jiraya) to an acceptable minimum level to take the hat.\n\nIt's true in other villages too - Gaara is the son of the previous Kazekage, Ay is the son of the previous Raikage, Kurosutchi is the granddaughter of the previous Tsuchikage - and that's just off the top of my head! Outside of the coup in mist, most Kage lineages are familial - or master/student (those that aren't, are outliers, often with unique circumstances).\n\nIt's just Monarchy without the bloodlines (and even then, families and their chosen successors seem to be the theme).",

Not a single Hokage wasn't either related to or taught by someone that was a previous Hokage. Minato's only a partial exception. Hashirama and Tobirama were brothers. Sarutobi was taught by Tobirama. Minato was taught by Jiraiya who was taught by Sarutobi. Tsunade was Hashirama's granddaughter and was taught by Sarutobi. Kakashi was taught by Minato. Naruto was taught by Kakashi and Jiraiya. The only person on that list that wasn't Hokage was Jiraiya and he was offered the position several times, was taught by one Hokage, was teammates with another, and taught two of the remaining Hokage. The power structure of Konoha is extremely nepotistic, partially because power is hereditary and partially because of normal nepotism.",

Danzo, like Hiruzen, was a student of Tobirama. Kakashi was a student of Minato and essentially a stop-gap until they could get Naruto (son of Minato, student of Kakashi and Jiraya) to an acceptable minimum level to take the hat.\n\nIt's true in other villages too - Gaara is the son of the previous Kazekage, Ay is the son of the previous Raikage, Kurosutchi is the granddaughter of the previous Tsuchikage - and that's just off the top of my head! Outside of the coup in mist, most Kage lineages are familial - or master/student (those that aren't, are outliers, often with unique circumstances).\n\nIt's just Monarchy without the bloodlines (and even then, families and their chosen successors seem to be the theme).",

The only person on that list that wasn't Hokage was Jiraiya and he was offered the position several times, was taught by one Hokage, was teammates with another, and taught two of the remaining Hokage.

Danzo, like Hiruzen, was a student of Tobirama. Kakashi was a student of Minato and essentially a stop-gap until they could get Naruto (son of Minato, student of Kakashi and Jiraya) to an acceptable minimum level to take the hat.\n\nIt's true in other villages too - Gaara is the son of the previous Kazekage, Ay is the son of the previous Raikage, Kurosutchi is the granddaughter of the previous Tsuchikage - and that's just off the top of my head! Outside of the coup in mist, most Kage lineages are familial - or master/student (those that aren't, are outliers, often with unique circumstances).\n\nIt's just Monarchy without the bloodlines (and even then, families and their chosen successors seem to be the theme).",

Not a single Hokage wasn't either related to or taught by someone that was a previous Hokage. Minato's only a partial exception. Hashirama and Tobirama were brothers. Sarutobi was taught by Tobirama. Minato was taught by Jiraiya who was taught by Sarutobi. Tsunade was Hashirama's granddaughter and was taught by Sarutobi. Kakashi was taught by Minato. Naruto was taught by Kakashi and Jiraiya. The only person on that list that wasn't Hokage was Jiraiya and he was offered the position several times, was taught by one Hokage, was teammates with another, and taught two of the remaining Hokage. The power structure of Konoha is extremely nepotistic, partially because power is hereditary and partially because of normal nepotism.",

Danzo, like Hiruzen, was a student of Tobirama. Kakashi was a student of Minato and essentially a stop-gap until they could get Naruto (son of Minato, student of Kakashi and Jiraya) to an acceptable minimum level to take the hat.\n\nIt's true in other villages too - Gaara is the son of the previous Kazekage, Ay is the son of the previous Raikage, Kurosutchi is the granddaughter of the previous Tsuchikage - and that's just off the top of my head! Outside of the coup in mist, most Kage lineages are familial - or master/student (those that aren't, are outliers, often with unique circumstances).\n\nIt's just Monarchy without the bloodlines (and even then, families and their chosen successors seem to be the theme).",

Danzo, like Hiruzen, was a student of Tobirama. Kakashi was a student of Minato and essentially a stop-gap until they could get Naruto (son of Minato, student of Kakashi and Jiraya) to an acceptable minimum level to take the hat.\n\nIt's true in other villages too - Gaara is the son of the previous Kazekage, Ay is the son of the previous Raikage, Kurosutchi is the granddaughter of the previous Tsuchikage - and that's just off the top of my head! Outside of the coup in mist, most Kage lineages are familial - or master/student (those that aren't, are outliers, often with unique circumstances).\n\nIt's just Monarchy without the bloodlines (and even then, families and their chosen successors seem to be the theme).",
