It wouldn't make sense that they have all these amazing jutsu but can barely use them much because they have barely enough chakrs.\n\nNaruto and Sasuke defeated Kaguya at her strongest with a bit of help from Obito and Sakura and then they defeated Momoshiki.\n\nBut they got shredded by Isshiki who was cut in half by Kaguya.",
