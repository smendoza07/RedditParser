In comparison to the Sharingan, which can only see chakra massed in the body, the Byakugan can see the individual pathways of the chakra network. That's what they mean when they said it's the stronger visual jutsu.\n\nGranted the Sharingan is pretty powerful itself what with the large increase to perception/reaction time and the myriad of genjutsu abilities opened up to them. It just doesn't compare visually to the Byakugan.",

The show never preached hard work > natural born talent. \nIt emphasized that hard work is important, but nearly every battle shonen does that. It DOES not say that hard work beats talent. In fact, in the exemplary fight that perfectly encapsulates the idea (Lee vs Gaara), Lee loses. It shows that while hard work may get you far, natural talent may be too much to overcome. This is again reiterated in Madara vs Guy. The series DOES say that hard work can get you far, as Lee still was able to become a splendid ninja, but the theme was NEVER hard work always beats talent. \n\nYou are aware that Naruto has a country destroying demon fox sealed inside him since chapter 1, and nearly all of his part 1 victories are due to that power leaking out. It was also established in the beginning that Naruto had huge chakra reserves. He always had the potential for massive power, he was just unskilled at first. Naruto and Sasuke both acknowledge each other as \u201cspecial\u201d at the final valley.\n\nIn fact it was made a point in shippuden that Naruto feels like all his victories are from power that isn\u2019t his own, which is why he trained to master the rasenshuriken, and was adamant on defeating Kakazu on his own to prove himself.\n\nUnfortunately people often project what they want the series to preach about rather than what it is actually about.",

Guy was sick and fighting back to back with Jonin level Shinobi and almost out of Chakra, still managed to evade jiraiyas toad that no one did before...and jiraiya was offered hokage seat. Even while he's sick and practically blind, Sasuke couldn't take him out, and all of it fell into place as itachi planned... he scared orochimaru shitless and made him leave akatsuki, with ONE genjutsu, when orochimaru still had his arms and power, whereas Sasuke beat orochimaru at his weakest. I think if he was allowed to stay alive, he could have become even stronger.. he was always devising strategies. It's a good thing he wasn't after the leaf village, cause tbh, they'd have no shot against akatsuki imo. That dude could single handedly fuck up a TEAM. Good thing he was on their side. Btw, I'm a fan, clearly, but he IS NOT GOD. He is defeatable but the author gave him a lot of power and in the end, made it so he was so strong only a terminal illness could take him out for real.",

The natural conclusion of that story tends to be the girl maturing and realizing that the Naruto-type is the type of guy you\u2019d want in a healthy and happy relationship, while the Sasuke-type leads to a toxic and unhappy relationship. \n\nGranted, I freaking hate that type of story, so I loved it when Kishi turned it on its head by having Naruto reject Sakura. It was cathartic to see him not putting with her shit anymore, with Sakura always putting Sasuke first and berating Naruto all the time, while Hinata was someone who had always admired and respected Naruto, he clearly made the right choice.\n\nI could also be totally wrong lol. And if that\u2019s the case then I have no logical explanation for why Sakura\u2019s story went the way it did.",

If Kishimoto originally intended for Naruto and Sakura to end up together, then he would\u2019ve probably just ended up writing the typical love story of the girl choosing the nice guy over the bad boy in the end.\n\nHOWEVER, if he changed his mind halfway through and decided that fans preferred Hinata to end up with Naruto, then that means he had to close the NarutoXSakura romance story somehow (leading to that fun little subversion of tropes we had) in order to start building towards a NarutoxHinata ending.\n\nWho knows? Maybe I\u2019m talking out of my ass and Kishi always intended for Naruto to end up with Hinata, but in my head I think it was a mid-series rewrite that ended up coming at the expense of Sakura\u2019s story (not that I mind that much, Hinata is best girl after all).",

However itachi would easily subdue Naruto with his genjutsu and kurama wouldn\u2019t break him out at the time unless he thought Naruto would die. Amaterasu could probably kill Naruto even with his regeneration abilities",

In comparison to the Sharingan, which can only see chakra massed in the body, the Byakugan can see the individual pathways of the chakra network. That's what they mean when they said it's the stronger visual jutsu.\n\nGranted the Sharingan is pretty powerful itself what with the large increase to perception/reaction time and the myriad of genjutsu abilities opened up to them. It just doesn't compare visually to the Byakugan.",

The show never preached hard work > natural born talent. \nIt emphasized that hard work is important, but nearly every battle shonen does that. It DOES not say that hard work beats talent. In fact, in the exemplary fight that perfectly encapsulates the idea (Lee vs Gaara), Lee loses. It shows that while hard work may get you far, natural talent may be too much to overcome. This is again reiterated in Madara vs Guy. The series DOES say that hard work can get you far, as Lee still was able to become a splendid ninja, but the theme was NEVER hard work always beats talent. \n\nYou are aware that Naruto has a country destroying demon fox sealed inside him since chapter 1, and nearly all of his part 1 victories are due to that power leaking out. It was also established in the beginning that Naruto had huge chakra reserves. He always had the potential for massive power, he was just unskilled at first. Naruto and Sasuke both acknowledge each other as \u201cspecial\u201d at the final valley.\n\nIn fact it was made a point in shippuden that Naruto feels like all his victories are from power that isn\u2019t his own, which is why he trained to master the rasenshuriken, and was adamant on defeating Kakazu on his own to prove himself.\n\nUnfortunately people often project what they want the series to preach about rather than what it is actually about.",

Guy was sick and fighting back to back with Jonin level Shinobi and almost out of Chakra, still managed to evade jiraiyas toad that no one did before...and jiraiya was offered hokage seat. Even while he's sick and practically blind, Sasuke couldn't take him out, and all of it fell into place as itachi planned... he scared orochimaru shitless and made him leave akatsuki, with ONE genjutsu, when orochimaru still had his arms and power, whereas Sasuke beat orochimaru at his weakest. I think if he was allowed to stay alive, he could have become even stronger.. he was always devising strategies. It's a good thing he wasn't after the leaf village, cause tbh, they'd have no shot against akatsuki imo. That dude could single handedly fuck up a TEAM. Good thing he was on their side. Btw, I'm a fan, clearly, but he IS NOT GOD. He is defeatable but the author gave him a lot of power and in the end, made it so he was so strong only a terminal illness could take him out for real.",

The natural conclusion of that story tends to be the girl maturing and realizing that the Naruto-type is the type of guy you\u2019d want in a healthy and happy relationship, while the Sasuke-type leads to a toxic and unhappy relationship. \n\nGranted, I freaking hate that type of story, so I loved it when Kishi turned it on its head by having Naruto reject Sakura. It was cathartic to see him not putting with her shit anymore, with Sakura always putting Sasuke first and berating Naruto all the time, while Hinata was someone who had always admired and respected Naruto, he clearly made the right choice.\n\nI could also be totally wrong lol.

Maybe I\u2019m talking out of my ass and Kishi always intended for Naruto to end up with Hinata, but in my head I think it was a mid-series rewrite that ended up coming at the expense of Sakura\u2019s story (not that I mind that much, Hinata is best girl after all).",

In comparison to the Sharingan, which can only see chakra massed in the body, the Byakugan can see the individual pathways of the chakra network. That's what they mean when they said it's the stronger visual jutsu.\n\nGranted the Sharingan is pretty powerful itself what with the large increase to perception/reaction time and the myriad of genjutsu abilities opened up to them. It just doesn't compare visually to the Byakugan.",

The show never preached hard work > natural born talent. \nIt emphasized that hard work is important, but nearly every battle shonen does that. It DOES not say that hard work beats talent. In fact, in the exemplary fight that perfectly encapsulates the idea (Lee vs Gaara), Lee loses. It shows that while hard work may get you far, natural talent may be too much to overcome. This is again reiterated in Madara vs Guy. The series DOES say that hard work can get you far, as Lee still was able to become a splendid ninja, but the theme was NEVER hard work always beats talent. \n\nYou are aware that Naruto has a country destroying demon fox sealed inside him since chapter 1, and nearly all of his part 1 victories are due to that power leaking out. It was also established in the beginning that Naruto had huge chakra reserves. He always had the potential for massive power, he was just unskilled at first. Naruto and Sasuke both acknowledge each other as \u201cspecial\u201d at the final valley.\n\nIn fact it was made a point in shippuden that Naruto feels like all his victories are from power that isn\u2019t his own, which is why he trained to master the rasenshuriken, and was adamant on defeating Kakazu on his own to prove himself.\n\nUnfortunately people often project what they want the series to preach about rather than what it is actually about.",

Even while he's sick and practically blind, Sasuke couldn't take him out, and all of it fell into place as itachi planned... he scared orochimaru shitless and made him leave akatsuki, with ONE genjutsu, when orochimaru still had his arms and power, whereas Sasuke beat orochimaru at his weakest. I think if he was allowed to stay alive, he could have become even stronger.. he was always devising strategies. It's a good thing he wasn't after the leaf village, cause tbh, they'd have no shot against akatsuki imo. That dude could single handedly fuck up a TEAM. Good thing he was on their side. Btw, I'm a fan, clearly, but he IS NOT GOD. He is defeatable but the author gave him a lot of power and in the end, made it so he was so strong only a terminal illness could take him out for real.",

The natural conclusion of that story tends to be the girl maturing and realizing that the Naruto-type is the type of guy you\u2019d want in a healthy and happy relationship, while the Sasuke-type leads to a toxic and unhappy relationship. \n\nGranted, I freaking hate that type of story, so I loved it when Kishi turned it on its head by having Naruto reject Sakura. It was cathartic to see him not putting with her shit anymore, with Sakura always putting Sasuke first and berating Naruto all the time, while Hinata was someone who had always admired and respected Naruto, he clearly made the right choice.\n\nI could also be totally wrong lol.

If Kishimoto originally intended for Naruto and Sakura to end up together, then he would\u2019ve probably just ended up writing the typical love story of the girl choosing the nice guy over the bad boy in the end.\n\nHOWEVER, if he changed his mind halfway through and decided that fans preferred Hinata to end up with Naruto, then that means he had to close the NarutoXSakura romance story somehow (leading to that fun little subversion of tropes we had) in order to start building towards a NarutoxHinata ending.\n\nWho knows? Maybe I\u2019m talking out of my ass and Kishi always intended for Naruto to end up with Hinata, but in my head I think it was a mid-series rewrite that ended up coming at the expense of Sakura\u2019s story (not that I mind that much, Hinata is best girl after all).",

Amaterasu could probably kill Naruto even with his regeneration abilities",

The show never preached hard work > natural born talent. \nIt emphasized that hard work is important, but nearly every battle shonen does that. It DOES not say that hard work beats talent. In fact, in the exemplary fight that perfectly encapsulates the idea (Lee vs Gaara), Lee loses. It shows that while hard work may get you far, natural talent may be too much to overcome. This is again reiterated in Madara vs Guy. The series DOES say that hard work can get you far, as Lee still was able to become a splendid ninja, but the theme was NEVER hard work always beats talent. \n\nYou are aware that Naruto has a country destroying demon fox sealed inside him since chapter 1, and nearly all of his part 1 victories are due to that power leaking out. It was also established in the beginning that Naruto had huge chakra reserves. He always had the potential for massive power, he was just unskilled at first. Naruto and Sasuke both acknowledge each other as \u201cspecial\u201d at the final valley.\n\nIn fact it was made a point in shippuden that Naruto feels like all his victories are from power that isn\u2019t his own, which is why he trained to master the rasenshuriken, and was adamant on defeating Kakazu on his own to prove himself.\n\nUnfortunately people often project what they want the series to preach about rather than what it is actually about.",

The natural conclusion of that story tends to be the girl maturing and realizing that the Naruto-type is the type of guy you\u2019d want in a healthy and happy relationship, while the Sasuke-type leads to a toxic and unhappy relationship. \n\nGranted, I freaking hate that type of story, so I loved it when Kishi turned it on its head by having Naruto reject Sakura. It was cathartic to see him not putting with her shit anymore, with Sakura always putting Sasuke first and berating Naruto all the time, while Hinata was someone who had always admired and respected Naruto, he clearly made the right choice.\n\nI could also be totally wrong lol. And if that\u2019s the case then I have no logical explanation for why Sakura\u2019s story went the way it did.",

If Kishimoto originally intended for Naruto and Sakura to end up together, then he would\u2019ve probably just ended up writing the typical love story of the girl choosing the nice guy over the bad boy in the end.\n\nHOWEVER, if he changed his mind halfway through and decided that fans preferred Hinata to end up with Naruto, then that means he had to close the NarutoXSakura romance story somehow (leading to that fun little subversion of tropes we had) in order to start building towards a NarutoxHinata ending.\n\nWho knows? Maybe I\u2019m talking out of my ass and Kishi always intended for Naruto to end up with Hinata, but in my head I think it was a mid-series rewrite that ended up coming at the expense of Sakura\u2019s story (not that I mind that much, Hinata is best girl after all).",

That's what they mean when they said it's the stronger visual jutsu.\n\nGranted the Sharingan is pretty powerful itself what with the large increase to perception/reaction time and the myriad of genjutsu abilities opened up to them.

The show never preached hard work > natural born talent. \nIt emphasized that hard work is important, but nearly every battle shonen does that. It DOES not say that hard work beats talent. In fact, in the exemplary fight that perfectly encapsulates the idea (Lee vs Gaara), Lee loses. It shows that while hard work may get you far, natural talent may be too much to overcome. This is again reiterated in Madara vs Guy. The series DOES say that hard work can get you far, as Lee still was able to become a splendid ninja, but the theme was NEVER hard work always beats talent. \n\nYou are aware that Naruto has a country destroying demon fox sealed inside him since chapter 1, and nearly all of his part 1 victories are due to that power leaking out. It was also established in the beginning that Naruto had huge chakra reserves. He always had the potential for massive power, he was just unskilled at first. Naruto and Sasuke both acknowledge each other as \u201cspecial\u201d at the final valley.\n\nIn fact it was made a point in shippuden that Naruto feels like all his victories are from power that isn\u2019t his own, which is why he trained to master the rasenshuriken, and was adamant on defeating Kakazu on his own to prove himself.\n\nUnfortunately people often project what they want the series to preach about rather than what it is actually about.",

The natural conclusion of that story tends to be the girl maturing and realizing that the Naruto-type is the type of guy you\u2019d want in a healthy and happy relationship, while the Sasuke-type leads to a toxic and unhappy relationship. \n\nGranted, I freaking hate that type of story, so I loved it when Kishi turned it on its head by having Naruto reject Sakura. It was cathartic to see him not putting with her shit anymore, with Sakura always putting Sasuke first and berating Naruto all the time, while Hinata was someone who had always admired and respected Naruto, he clearly made the right choice.\n\nI could also be totally wrong lol. And if that\u2019s the case then I have no logical explanation for why Sakura\u2019s story went the way it did.",

If Kishimoto originally intended for Naruto and Sakura to end up together, then he would\u2019ve probably just ended up writing the typical love story of the girl choosing the nice guy over the bad boy in the end.\n\nHOWEVER, if he changed his mind halfway through and decided that fans preferred Hinata to end up with Naruto, then that means he had to close the NarutoXSakura romance story somehow (leading to that fun little subversion of tropes we had) in order to start building towards a NarutoxHinata ending.\n\nWho knows? Maybe I\u2019m talking out of my ass and Kishi always intended for Naruto to end up with Hinata, but in my head I think it was a mid-series rewrite that ended up coming at the expense of Sakura\u2019s story (not that I mind that much, Hinata is best girl after all).",

In comparison to the Sharingan, which can only see chakra massed in the body, the Byakugan can see the individual pathways of the chakra network. That's what they mean when they said it's the stronger visual jutsu.\n\nGranted the Sharingan is pretty powerful itself what with the large increase to perception/reaction time and the myriad of genjutsu abilities opened up to them. It just doesn't compare visually to the Byakugan.",

The show never preached hard work > natural born talent. \nIt emphasized that hard work is important, but nearly every battle shonen does that. It DOES not say that hard work beats talent. In fact, in the exemplary fight that perfectly encapsulates the idea (Lee vs Gaara), Lee loses. It shows that while hard work may get you far, natural talent may be too much to overcome. This is again reiterated in Madara vs Guy. The series DOES say that hard work can get you far, as Lee still was able to become a splendid ninja, but the theme was NEVER hard work always beats talent. \n\nYou are aware that Naruto has a country destroying demon fox sealed inside him since chapter 1, and nearly all of his part 1 victories are due to that power leaking out. It was also established in the beginning that Naruto had huge chakra reserves. He always had the potential for massive power, he was just unskilled at first. Naruto and Sasuke both acknowledge each other as \u201cspecial\u201d at the final valley.\n\nIn fact it was made a point in shippuden that Naruto feels like all his victories are from power that isn\u2019t his own, which is why he trained to master the rasenshuriken, and was adamant on defeating Kakazu on his own to prove himself.\n\nUnfortunately people often project what they want the series to preach about rather than what it is actually about.",

Talent is everything in Naruto unless you are Gai. Even Rock Lee is fodder trash in Shippuden.",

The natural conclusion of that story tends to be the girl maturing and realizing that the Naruto-type is the type of guy you\u2019d want in a healthy and happy relationship, while the Sasuke-type leads to a toxic and unhappy relationship. \n\nGranted, I freaking hate that type of story, so I loved it when Kishi turned it on its head by having Naruto reject Sakura. It was cathartic to see him not putting with her shit anymore, with Sakura always putting Sasuke first and berating Naruto all the time, while Hinata was someone who had always admired and respected Naruto, he clearly made the right choice.\n\nI could also be totally wrong lol.

Maybe I\u2019m talking out of my ass and Kishi always intended for Naruto to end up with Hinata, but in my head I think it was a mid-series rewrite that ended up coming at the expense of Sakura\u2019s story (not that I mind that much, Hinata is best girl after all).",

The show never preached hard work > natural born talent. \nIt emphasized that hard work is important, but nearly every battle shonen does that. It DOES not say that hard work beats talent. In fact, in the exemplary fight that perfectly encapsulates the idea (Lee vs Gaara), Lee loses. It shows that while hard work may get you far, natural talent may be too much to overcome. This is again reiterated in Madara vs Guy. The series DOES say that hard work can get you far, as Lee still was able to become a splendid ninja, but the theme was NEVER hard work always beats talent. \n\nYou are aware that Naruto has a country destroying demon fox sealed inside him since chapter 1, and nearly all of his part 1 victories are due to that power leaking out. It was also established in the beginning that Naruto had huge chakra reserves. He always had the potential for massive power, he was just unskilled at first. Naruto and Sasuke both acknowledge each other as \u201cspecial\u201d at the final valley.\n\nIn fact it was made a point in shippuden that Naruto feels like all his victories are from power that isn\u2019t his own, which is why he trained to master the rasenshuriken, and was adamant on defeating Kakazu on his own to prove himself.\n\nUnfortunately people often project what they want the series to preach about rather than what it is actually about.",

The natural conclusion of that story tends to be the girl maturing and realizing that the Naruto-type is the type of guy you\u2019d want in a healthy and happy relationship, while the Sasuke-type leads to a toxic and unhappy relationship. \n\nGranted, I freaking hate that type of story, so I loved it when Kishi turned it on its head by having Naruto reject Sakura. It was cathartic to see him not putting with her shit anymore, with Sakura always putting Sasuke first and berating Naruto all the time, while Hinata was someone who had always admired and respected Naruto, he clearly made the right choice.\n\nI could also be totally wrong lol. And if that\u2019s the case then I have no logical explanation for why Sakura\u2019s story went the way it did.",

If Kishimoto originally intended for Naruto and Sakura to end up together, then he would\u2019ve probably just ended up writing the typical love story of the girl choosing the nice guy over the bad boy in the end.\n\nHOWEVER, if he changed his mind halfway through and decided that fans preferred Hinata to end up with Naruto, then that means he had to close the NarutoXSakura romance story somehow (leading to that fun little subversion of tropes we had) in order to start building towards a NarutoxHinata ending.\n\nWho knows? Maybe I\u2019m talking out of my ass and Kishi always intended for Naruto to end up with Hinata, but in my head I think it was a mid-series rewrite that ended up coming at the expense of Sakura\u2019s story (not that I mind that much, Hinata is best girl after all).",

It DOES not say that hard work beats talent. In fact, in the exemplary fight that perfectly encapsulates the idea (Lee vs Gaara), Lee loses. It shows that while hard work may get you far, natural talent may be too much to overcome. This is again reiterated in Madara vs Guy. The series DOES say that hard work can get you far, as Lee still was able to become a splendid ninja, but the theme was NEVER hard work always beats talent. \n\nYou are aware that Naruto has a country destroying demon fox sealed inside him since chapter 1, and nearly all of his part 1 victories are due to that power leaking out. It was also established in the beginning that Naruto had huge chakra reserves. He always had the potential for massive power, he was just unskilled at first. Naruto and Sasuke both acknowledge each other as \u201cspecial\u201d at the final valley.\n\nIn fact it was made a point in shippuden that Naruto feels like all his victories are from power that isn\u2019t his own, which is why he trained to master the rasenshuriken, and was adamant on defeating Kakazu on his own to prove himself.\n\nUnfortunately people often project what they want the series to preach about rather than what it is actually about.",

The natural conclusion of that story tends to be the girl maturing and realizing that the Naruto-type is the type of guy you\u2019d want in a healthy and happy relationship, while the Sasuke-type leads to a toxic and unhappy relationship. \n\nGranted, I freaking hate that type of story, so I loved it when Kishi turned it on its head by having Naruto reject Sakura. It was cathartic to see him not putting with her shit anymore, with Sakura always putting Sasuke first and berating Naruto all the time, while Hinata was someone who had always admired and respected Naruto, he clearly made the right choice.\n\nI could also be totally wrong lol. And if that\u2019s the case then I have no logical explanation for why Sakura\u2019s story went the way it did.",

If Kishimoto originally intended for Naruto and Sakura to end up together, then he would\u2019ve probably just ended up writing the typical love story of the girl choosing the nice guy over the bad boy in the end.\n\nHOWEVER, if he changed his mind halfway through and decided that fans preferred Hinata to end up with Naruto, then that means he had to close the NarutoXSakura romance story somehow (leading to that fun little subversion of tropes we had) in order to start building towards a NarutoxHinata ending.\n\nWho knows? Maybe I\u2019m talking out of my ass and Kishi always intended for Naruto to end up with Hinata, but in my head I think it was a mid-series rewrite that ended up coming at the expense of Sakura\u2019s story (not that I mind that much, Hinata is best girl after all).",

It DOES not say that hard work beats talent. In fact, in the exemplary fight that perfectly encapsulates the idea (Lee vs Gaara), Lee loses. It shows that while hard work may get you far, natural talent may be too much to overcome. This is again reiterated in Madara vs Guy. The series DOES say that hard work can get you far, as Lee still was able to become a splendid ninja, but the theme was NEVER hard work always beats talent. \n\nYou are aware that Naruto has a country destroying demon fox sealed inside him since chapter 1, and nearly all of his part 1 victories are due to that power leaking out. It was also established in the beginning that Naruto had huge chakra reserves. He always had the potential for massive power, he was just unskilled at first. Naruto and Sasuke both acknowledge each other as \u201cspecial\u201d at the final valley.\n\nIn fact it was made a point in shippuden that Naruto feels like all his victories are from power that isn\u2019t his own, which is why he trained to master the rasenshuriken, and was adamant on defeating Kakazu on his own to prove himself.\n\nUnfortunately people often project what they want the series to preach about rather than what it is actually about.",

It was cathartic to see him not putting with her shit anymore, with Sakura always putting Sasuke first and berating Naruto all the time, while Hinata was someone who had always admired and respected Naruto, he clearly made the right choice.\n\nI could also be totally wrong lol.

Maybe I\u2019m talking out of my ass and Kishi always intended for Naruto to end up with Hinata, but in my head I think it was a mid-series rewrite that ended up coming at the expense of Sakura\u2019s story (not that I mind that much, Hinata is best girl after all).",

It DOES not say that hard work beats talent. In fact, in the exemplary fight that perfectly encapsulates the idea (Lee vs Gaara), Lee loses. It shows that while hard work may get you far, natural talent may be too much to overcome. This is again reiterated in Madara vs Guy. The series DOES say that hard work can get you far, as Lee still was able to become a splendid ninja, but the theme was NEVER hard work always beats talent. \n\nYou are aware that Naruto has a country destroying demon fox sealed inside him since chapter 1, and nearly all of his part 1 victories are due to that power leaking out. It was also established in the beginning that Naruto had huge chakra reserves. He always had the potential for massive power, he was just unskilled at first. Naruto and Sasuke both acknowledge each other as \u201cspecial\u201d at the final valley.\n\nIn fact it was made a point in shippuden that Naruto feels like all his victories are from power that isn\u2019t his own, which is why he trained to master the rasenshuriken, and was adamant on defeating Kakazu on his own to prove himself.\n\nUnfortunately people often project what they want the series to preach about rather than what it is actually about.",

The natural conclusion of that story tends to be the girl maturing and realizing that the Naruto-type is the type of guy you\u2019d want in a healthy and happy relationship, while the Sasuke-type leads to a toxic and unhappy relationship. \n\nGranted, I freaking hate that type of story, so I loved it when Kishi turned it on its head by having Naruto reject Sakura. It was cathartic to see him not putting with her shit anymore, with Sakura always putting Sasuke first and berating Naruto all the time, while Hinata was someone who had always admired and respected Naruto, he clearly made the right choice.\n\nI could also be totally wrong lol. And if that\u2019s the case then I have no logical explanation for why Sakura\u2019s story went the way it did.",
