Start getting your clothes tailored, and if it's not a \"oh hell yes\" donate it or leave it on the rack. You also want to either adjust the balance on your phone or switch out the lip balm.  (Unless you're wearing makeup on purpose, in which case that's fine.)

The overly groomed aspect to your styling, plus the comments about the absurd levels of sunscreen etc (30 spf is fine btw), may have biased me to thinking that you would be the kind to be plucking away at yourself, but they are certainly wider set brows than usual.  The \u2018comedic\u2019 might have been going a bit far, but I meant it to illustrate the way some people pluck them too far apart and get the clown brow thing.  Another thing that may be adding to it is how the poses in your pics all have fairly exaggerated facial expressions that may be sending the brows further askew than your resting face.\n\nI\u2019m sure you can take solace in all the \u2018you look so young\u2019 posts, given it seems to be quite a thing for you, and the less flattering posts like mine will mean little in the scheme of things.\n\nEdit:  I had a closer look.  You have to be dyeing your brows and eyelashes.  I think that\u2019s a good part of why people are saying you look trans (although I\u2019m not convinced you\u2019re not, and this isn\u2019t just a \u2018do I pass?\u2019), because it essentially looks like mascara and brow makeup on a fair person.  Being fair myself (and having been an aesthetician), I can say I\u2019ve never seen a person with fair hair and a fair moustache with black brows and lashes.  But I see if you have done this, you missed the white part on one of your brows in the center?  This is what\u2019s making them look less symmetrical and more far set.  If by chance you have a bizarre thing in which you are fair but grow black brows and lashes (which I doubt, but bet you\u2019ll claim, and to be fair, anything is possible), you could always dye that white central bit.  But I think you like to keep it because it\u2019s something you feel makes you unique, even if it takes away from your attractiveness/facial balance.  That\u2019s a personal choice, as is the mo\u2019.  I\u2019m thinking you think the white hair makes you unique.",

The overly groomed aspect to your styling, plus the comments about the absurd levels of sunscreen etc (30 spf is fine btw), may have biased me to thinking that you would be the kind to be plucking away at yourself, but they are certainly wider set brows than usual.  The \u2018comedic\u2019 might have been going a bit far, but I meant it to illustrate the way some people pluck them too far apart and get the clown brow thing.  Another thing that may be adding to it is how the poses in your pics all have fairly exaggerated facial expressions that may be sending the brows further askew than your resting face.\n\nI\u2019m sure you can take solace in all the \u2018you look so young\u2019 posts, given it seems to be quite a thing for you, and the less flattering posts like mine will mean little in the scheme of things.\n\nEdit:  I had a closer look.  You have to be dyeing your brows and eyelashes.  I think that\u2019s a good part of why people are saying you look trans (although I\u2019m not convinced you\u2019re not, and this isn\u2019t just a \u2018do I pass?\u2019), because it essentially looks like mascara and brow makeup on a fair person.  Being fair myself (and having been an aesthetician), I can say I\u2019ve never seen a person with fair hair and a fair moustache with black brows and lashes.  But I see if you have done this, you missed the white part on one of your brows in the center?  This is what\u2019s making them look less symmetrical and more far set.  If by chance you have a bizarre thing in which you are fair but grow black brows and lashes (which I doubt, but bet you\u2019ll claim, and to be fair, anything is possible), you could always dye that white central bit.  But I think you like to keep it because it\u2019s something you feel makes you unique, even if it takes away from your attractiveness/facial balance.  That\u2019s a personal choice, as is the mo\u2019.  I\u2019m thinking you think the white hair makes you unique.",

The overly groomed aspect to your styling, plus the comments about the absurd levels of sunscreen etc (30 spf is fine btw), may have biased me to thinking that you would be the kind to be plucking away at yourself, but they are certainly wider set brows than usual.  The \u2018comedic\u2019 might have been going a bit far, but I meant it to illustrate the way some people pluck them too far apart and get the clown brow thing.  Another thing that may be adding to it is how the poses in your pics all have fairly exaggerated facial expressions that may be sending the brows further askew than your resting face.\n\nI\u2019m sure you can take solace in all the \u2018you look so young\u2019 posts, given it seems to be quite a thing for you, and the less flattering posts like mine will mean little in the scheme of things.\n\nEdit:  I had a closer look.  You have to be dyeing your brows and eyelashes.  I think that\u2019s a good part of why people are saying you look trans (although I\u2019m not convinced you\u2019re not, and this isn\u2019t just a \u2018do I pass?\u2019), because it essentially looks like mascara and brow makeup on a fair person.  Being fair myself (and having been an aesthetician), I can say I\u2019ve never seen a person with fair hair and a fair moustache with black brows and lashes.  But I see if you have done this, you missed the white part on one of your brows in the center?  This is what\u2019s making them look less symmetrical and more far set.  If by chance you have a bizarre thing in which you are fair but grow black brows and lashes (which I doubt, but bet you\u2019ll claim, and to be fair, anything is possible), you could always dye that white central bit.  But I think you like to keep it because it\u2019s something you feel makes you unique, even if it takes away from your attractiveness/facial balance.  That\u2019s a personal choice, as is the mo\u2019.  I\u2019m thinking you think the white hair makes you unique.",
