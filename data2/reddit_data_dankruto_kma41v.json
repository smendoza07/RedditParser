He had a bad childhood his father would often beat him, both of his parents died when he was in his adulthood where he became homeless. He failed art school which was the last hope for him to do sth for a living. Now hes on the streets selling pictures he drew and barely survives on the streets in Austria (btw his father was a austrian enthusiast and hated germans so Hitler wanted to be german and hated Austria bc he hated his father) WW1 began. He enlisted in the army, where he had Comrades, friends, sth like a family, food and a warm bed. In WW1 a grenade nearly killed him. But he survived beeing blinded for 5-7 days and a broken leg. He was sent to Hospital. When he recovered in Hospital he discovered that germany lost the war. He was angry and wanted to undo the versailler (idk document? Not a native speaker). So there were many situations where you could help him instead of killing him. When he was young he lost his brother. You couldve just gave him a home. Or sth to eat.",

He failed art school which was the last hope for him to do sth for a living. Now hes on the streets selling pictures he drew and barely survives on the streets in Austria (btw his father was a austrian enthusiast and hated germans so Hitler wanted to be german and hated Austria bc he hated his father) WW1 began. He enlisted in the army, where he had Comrades, friends, sth like a family, food and a warm bed. In WW1 a grenade nearly killed him. But he survived beeing blinded for 5-7 days and a broken leg. He was sent to Hospital. When he recovered in Hospital he discovered that germany lost the war. He was angry and wanted to undo the versailler (idk document? Not a native speaker). So there were many situations where you could help him instead of killing him. When he was young he lost his brother. You couldve just gave him a home. Or sth to eat.",

He failed art school which was the last hope for him to do sth for a living. Now hes on the streets selling pictures he drew and barely survives on the streets in Austria (btw his father was a austrian enthusiast and hated germans so Hitler wanted to be german and hated Austria bc he hated his father) WW1 began. He enlisted in the army, where he had Comrades, friends, sth like a family, food and a warm bed. In WW1 a grenade nearly killed him. But he survived beeing blinded for 5-7 days and a broken leg. He was sent to Hospital. When he recovered in Hospital he discovered that germany lost the war. He was angry and wanted to undo the versailler (idk document? Not a native speaker). So there were many situations where you could help him instead of killing him. When he was young he lost his brother. You couldve just gave him a home. Or sth to eat.",

Now hes on the streets selling pictures he drew and barely survives on the streets in Austria (btw his father was a austrian enthusiast and hated germans so Hitler wanted to be german and hated Austria bc he hated his father) WW1 began. He enlisted in the army, where he had Comrades, friends, sth like a family, food and a warm bed. In WW1 a grenade nearly killed him. But he survived beeing blinded for 5-7 days and a broken leg. He was sent to Hospital. When he recovered in Hospital he discovered that germany lost the war. He was angry and wanted to undo the versailler (idk document? Not a native speaker). So there were many situations where you could help him instead of killing him. When he was young he lost his brother. You couldve just gave him a home. Or sth to eat.",

He enlisted in the army, where he had Comrades, friends, sth like a family, food and a warm bed. In WW1 a grenade nearly killed him. But he survived beeing blinded for 5-7 days and a broken leg. He was sent to Hospital. When he recovered in Hospital he discovered that germany lost the war. He was angry and wanted to undo the versailler (idk document? Not a native speaker). So there were many situations where you could help him instead of killing him. When he was young he lost his brother. You couldve just gave him a home. Or sth to eat.",

He failed art school which was the last hope for him to do sth for a living. Now hes on the streets selling pictures he drew and barely survives on the streets in Austria (btw his father was a austrian enthusiast and hated germans so Hitler wanted to be german and hated Austria bc he hated his father) WW1 began. He enlisted in the army, where he had Comrades, friends, sth like a family, food and a warm bed. In WW1 a grenade nearly killed him. But he survived beeing blinded for 5-7 days and a broken leg. He was sent to Hospital. When he recovered in Hospital he discovered that germany lost the war. He was angry and wanted to undo the versailler (idk document? Not a native speaker). So there were many situations where you could help him instead of killing him. When he was young he lost his brother. You couldve just gave him a home. Or sth to eat.",

He failed art school which was the last hope for him to do sth for a living. Now hes on the streets selling pictures he drew and barely survives on the streets in Austria (btw his father was a austrian enthusiast and hated germans so Hitler wanted to be german and hated Austria bc he hated his father) WW1 began. He enlisted in the army, where he had Comrades, friends, sth like a family, food and a warm bed. In WW1 a grenade nearly killed him. But he survived beeing blinded for 5-7 days and a broken leg. He was sent to Hospital. When he recovered in Hospital he discovered that germany lost the war. He was angry and wanted to undo the versailler (idk document? Not a native speaker). So there were many situations where you could help him instead of killing him. When he was young he lost his brother. You couldve just gave him a home. Or sth to eat.",
