Apparently there are some people who now get  cosmetic surgery done to get shoulders like that. I remember in the Street Human Fighter Episode the professional dancer (Monica?) commented on Somin's bone structure when complimenting her dance that involved rolling the shoulders. South Korea has some strangely specific beauty standards. I'm glad in the West the beauty standards are less specific.",
