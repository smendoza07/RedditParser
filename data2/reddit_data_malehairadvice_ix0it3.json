            "body": "Man, some of these comments are ruthless... Your hair is at an in between stage so it's gonna look a bit funky for a bit. I think the best thing to do for your hair is to use some curling mousse and/or sea salt spray. Apply the mousse to your the ends of your hair (DON'T TOUCH THE ROOTS) while it's still wet from a shower and scrunch it up as you go. For the sea salt spray, do the same thing, apply all over hair while it's wet making sure not to overdo it or else your hair will get mad at you. I suggest blow drying your hair if you want to give that a shot to help add some volume at the top since it seems to lose some shape up there. If you do try, here are the steps you can follow if you want, this is all personal preference and remember you can remove a step if you don't want to do it...\n\n1 - start with wet hair\n\n2 - apply a generous amount of curling mousse to the ends of your hair, AVOID THE ROOTS. As you apply, scrunch your hair up to get the natural curls working.\n\n3 - apply a tiny bit of sea salt spray to the sides of your hair, the back, and at the top near your crown. Don't put a lot, just one spritz each location. After this, scrunch up your hair again.\n\n4 - Spray some heat protectant on your hair so the blow dry doesn't damage it. If you choose not to blow dry and want to simply air dry, you can ignore this step obviously.\n\n5 - Finally, blow dry on low heat, making sure to scrunch up your hair as you go to help the waves and curls out. This also helps your shape your hair. Flip your head over so your hair is just free hanging in the air and blow dry/scrunch for a bit in that position. While doing this, focus on the top of your head to add some volume to it.",
