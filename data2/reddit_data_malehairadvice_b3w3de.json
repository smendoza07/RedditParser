It can be hard to find a cheaper barber and you may have to go through multiple poor quality haircuts until you find someone good in the 10-15 dollar range. Try finding some younger guys on Instagram that cut hair more in the 20-25 dollar range. \n\nIf you are willing to pay 20 dollars every three weeks for a shitty sports clip haircut then you would be better off paying 30 dollars every three weeks for a good haircut.

I'd start from the parted side, go diagonally up and then curve it down so there's a bit of a swoop.\n\nProduct choice is more important I think, in the first picture I used to use either nothing or a quite heavy wax, and my hair does terribly with product buildup and just flops down as it did then. Find out your porosity online, there's a quiz and also some other tests, and use that to determine what kinds of products work best for your hair. Mine's low porosity and in that second picture what worked much better was some sea salt (bumble and bumble have a good one) and some generic volumising powder.\n\nLastly the haircut itself is really important, and in the second pic I specifically asked them for more texture so they would point cut the top instead of straight cutting it.

I'd start from the parted side, go diagonally up and then curve it down so there's a bit of a swoop.\n\nProduct choice is more important I think, in the first picture I used to use either nothing or a quite heavy wax, and my hair does terribly with product buildup and just flops down as it did then. Find out your porosity online, there's a quiz and also some other tests, and use that to determine what kinds of products work best for your hair. Mine's low porosity and in that second picture what worked much better was some sea salt (bumble and bumble have a good one) and some generic volumising powder.\n\nLastly the haircut itself is really important, and in the second pic I specifically asked them for more texture so they would point cut the top instead of straight cutting it.
