It always fascinate me on how well the 6sense's girls get along when they starred in a seasonal show with only 31 episodes in total (so far).\n\nI mean, of course their personalities mesh well but I wasn't expecting 'that' well, in a short amount of time. Especially, considering that the filming finishes in one day (per episode) and the girls wasn't super close with one another before the show.",
