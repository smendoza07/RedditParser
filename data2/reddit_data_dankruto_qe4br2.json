Keep in mind my original introduction was the design in Naruto storm Road to Boruto. The left made me wonder what they were going for. \"Sexy and cool\"? Yeah a sexy and cool 12 year old that's what this series needs.\n\nAnyone remember who said, some writer might have been Kishimoto, they thought fans sexualize Sarada too much, but the left is the actual design. sorry dude your character designer did it way before fans.",

Its a shame because he was the background artist from Naruto if I remember correctly. \n\nFans were sexualizing sarada quickly after boruto was made though and kishimoto did take over the project recently and ikemoto changed the design back so now the problem is the fans. Part 1 Naruto has a similar problem with hinata and Naruto, but its not as bad as sarada since we have adult forms of Naruto and gang so most hentai artists are using the adult forms.

And it ultimately feels hypocritical when someone within talkS about fans doing it when before you made the statement your character designer did it. It's just strange. I figured Kishimoto didn't make the designs and was just a consultant at the time. Also hentai artist doing it is one thing someone on Viz's payroll with the creator of the series in his ear is another. The design may have been in a game but I don't think it is strikers and Sarada has multiple versions in Naruto storm and none of them are the left..... They aren't the right either, but naturally it's fanmade. \n\nAnd I like Sarada but damn she feels like an afterthought and she is sexualized. Man this is worst than 12 yo Sakura. She wasn't even sexualized she was just on the back burner. Now Sarada on the back burner to Kawaki, Naruto, Sasuke, and Boruto. To the point the only thing missing is an arc where she gets kidnapped........ Plz don't tell me they have/are gonna do that?",

And it ultimately feels hypocritical when someone within talkS about fans doing it when before you made the statement your character designer did it. It's just strange. I figured Kishimoto didn't make the designs and was just a consultant at the time. Also hentai artist doing it is one thing someone on Viz's payroll with the creator of the series in his ear is another. The design may have been in a game but I don't think it is strikers and Sarada has multiple versions in Naruto storm and none of them are the left..... They aren't the right either, but naturally it's fanmade. \n\nAnd I like Sarada but damn she feels like an afterthought and she is sexualized. Man this is worst than 12 yo Sakura. She wasn't even sexualized she was just on the back burner. Now Sarada on the back burner to Kawaki, Naruto, Sasuke, and Boruto. To the point the only thing missing is an arc where she gets kidnapped........ Plz don't tell me they have/are gonna do that?",

At least Hinata is already pass her Japanese age of consent, it doesnt makes it right to sexualize her because no one should get sexualized in the first place.

Not all people want to see her tits all the time (yes a portion of fcked up people in the fandom did), and again,Sarada is 12 y/o she's still a child people has the right to hate her design in the manga.",

Yet she gets little screen time and that just sucks, so much wated potencial. And it just sucks that we know that all that wasted potential happens cause is because she is a girl.\n\nEdit: forgot to say this is a personal opinion, not a fact, not me saying I know better than everyone or something.",

It's legit creepy. Sarada looks more like a prostitute here. And she is not only case either, other little girls in the boruto manga are also dressed like this. \n\nSexualising aside, that short of a skirt and high hills don't look practical for ninjas at all. Kishimoto was the artist for the Naruto manga, *not* the boruto manga and as much as he sucked at writing female characters, I don't remember him using twelve year old girls for fan service.",

Its a shame because he was the background artist from Naruto if I remember correctly. \n\nFans were sexualizing sarada quickly after boruto was made though and kishimoto did take over the project recently and ikemoto changed the design back so now the problem is the fans. Part 1 Naruto has a similar problem with hinata and Naruto, but its not as bad as sarada since we have adult forms of Naruto and gang so most hentai artists are using the adult forms.

Not all people want to see her tits all the time (yes a portion of fcked up people in the fandom did), and again,Sarada is 12 y/o she's still a child people has the right to hate her design in the manga.",

It's legit creepy. Sarada looks more like a prostitute here. And she is not only case either, other little girls in the boruto manga are also dressed like this. \n\nSexualising aside, that short of a skirt and high hills don't look practical for ninjas at all. Kishimoto was the artist for the Naruto manga, *not* the boruto manga and as much as he sucked at writing female characters, I don't remember him using twelve year old girls for fan service.",

And it ultimately feels hypocritical when someone within talkS about fans doing it when before you made the statement your character designer did it. It's just strange. I figured Kishimoto didn't make the designs and was just a consultant at the time. Also hentai artist doing it is one thing someone on Viz's payroll with the creator of the series in his ear is another. The design may have been in a game but I don't think it is strikers and Sarada has multiple versions in Naruto storm and none of them are the left..... They aren't the right either, but naturally it's fanmade. \n\nAnd I like Sarada but damn she feels like an afterthought and she is sexualized. Man this is worst than 12 yo Sakura. She wasn't even sexualized she was just on the back burner. Now Sarada on the back burner to Kawaki, Naruto, Sasuke, and Boruto. To the point the only thing missing is an arc where she gets kidnapped........ Plz don't tell me they have/are gonna do that?",
