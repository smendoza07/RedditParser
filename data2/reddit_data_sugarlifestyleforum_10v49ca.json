    "body": "I see a lot of posts about SDs complaining about the new demands that women are making, escorts, scammers, etc, but SA is totally different from what it was originally or is supposed to be.\n\nSo many men on this forum scoff at allowance. They want either weekly allowance or PPM (honestly, but kind of the same thing), they want sex immediately and every meet, while they say they don\u2019t want escorts. They are not willing to take on the personal risk (paying an allowance at the beginning) but want a girl who is cool with sex for a PPM knowing she might never see the guy again.\n\nExample: you receive your PPM, the guy has sex with you (and knows he only wants one time because he can get more girls for less money this way), then he ghosts you. If this happens to a SB ten times, she has now had sex with ten men one time each. Is she now an escort? Is she being forced to be by these conditions?\n\nIt\u2019s super disheartening honestly. \n\nAnd what I would like to know is how is this different from escorting? A sugar relationship implies not just mutual benefit, but mutual choice and advantage. When the SDs make the rules and set the pace/money exchange, is that really so mutually beneficial? When a woman sleeps with you expecting a monthly amount, and you end it after one date, how is that acceptable?",

Out of sheer curiosity, I made one fake account as a woman, and one as a man a while back. I came accross **a lot** of delusional and entitled people. \n\nMen wanting sex on the first meet, saying they don't offer allowance, but instead offer \"experience\" and \"advice,\" offering low PPM, asking women to host.\n\nYoung women wanting \"platonic\" relationships, while receiving monthly allowance. A few older women looking for a wealthy SD and a ridiculously high allowance.\n\nOverall, just lots of scammers, predators (both men and women), and a lot of men who would be better off just hiring an escort. It was an interesting experiment.",

It's interesting that **SB's behavior changes when they get allowance.**  Suddenly they do not initiate contact and if they do it is for more money.  When you try to arrange a meetup they are busy or some other life event  happened and they cannot make it.  *Why is that?  Perhaps it is because once they have the money in hand they do not give a f\\*ck?*  Even with the arrangements where I offered allowance we both started with PPM first to establish a true relationship built on trust.\n\nPS  Great post though OP",

If their standards do not match with ours then it's best to go our own way.

Are you going to have sex all month and hope he pays you? NO, of course not. So why does the SD have to take all the risk?\n\nPPM will always be the norm in the beginning. I do agree vetting is huge when doing this.\n\nI am in my 3rd month of an SR. We are weekly allowance now. We started ppm. I asked her if she wanted two weeks upfront. She did not. My SB prefers her allowance on a certain day every week. It helps her budget her expenses.\n\nAgain, many of us will go as many platonic dates as possible.

If I am interested in a POT SB either before or after an M'n'G I'll suggest starting with platonic dates and discuss a specific PPM for a specific type of date, meaning, is it just lunch, or dinner, or an activity or a combination. I find this let's me very freely and openly get to know someone, break the ice, go beyond the nervousness and anxiety of expectations. After 1 - 3 platonic dates, things either warm up or you walk, either one of you. But if you're going to continue you can then increase the PPM or go to an allowance. How do you SBs or even other SDs feel about doing this? Admittedly, I'm older; I've had a fulfilling life; many lovely relationships; I love people; so, I'm in no rush. I don't care for any sort of dishonesty or anxiety, I want to be able to communicate freely on any topic. I am still very active (business and study) and don't usually want to go out for fun or entertainment than a couple of times per week.

This is compounded by very cynical attitudes or baggage from prior bad experiences due to poor judgement/filtering/vetting or bad luck. It can be a self-fulfilling prophecy - wanting to rush to intimacy without getting to know the other person because they don't want to get taken advantage of and because they haven't taken the time to get to know the other person they run into bad actors more frequently.\n\n- SBs with unrealistic expectations about their own desirability/attractiveness and the availability of SDs with the requisite wealth to support the lifestyle beyond hotel PPM dates. This is compounded by very cynical attitudes or baggage from prior bad experiences due to poor judgement/filtering/vetting or bad luck. Coming to sugaring from a place of financial desperation can also lead to self-fulfilling prophecies and horrible life changing outcomes.\n\nOn the flip side, high quality SDs still find high quality SBs and vice-versa. None of this PPM business. None of this score keeping. None of this rush to intimacy. None of this short term arrangement mentality. Still as good as it ever has been!\n\nGood luck!",

            "body": "This is an interesting conundrum and I believe comes back to a bigger issue which is the wider societal need for instant gratification. \n\nMy personal preference has always been to have 2+ completely platonic getting to know you dates before the beginning or even discussion of an allowance (at least the details as the very notion of being on SA has always meant an allowance for me). \n\nThe problem I\u2019ve found is the site has been proliferated by scammers and part-time escorts (or what would have commonly been known as good-time-girls back in the day) and this means huge problems vetting and also being able to get to know people. \n\nFor me, the crux of what I\u2019m always looking for is a relationship which comes with most of the good stuff and less of the bad stuff.  There\u2019s no incentive for the ppm m&g girls to do this as they have a wide pool of men they can have sex with and they clearly don\u2019t want a relationship.  And then we have the ppm m&g girls who really don\u2019t want to do this lifestyle at all but because of circumstances, friends etc are led down this route and it\u2019s evident in bedroom that they really should not be doing this and on we go. \n\nI\u2019ve always brought a little gift to the m&g as a thank you for turning up but I don\u2019t go on about it beforehand because I genuinely believe that if someone is honestly interested in a proper sugar relationship, they will do the decent thing and actually turn up. \n\nAnybody going into this in 2023 thinking they are going to get a monthly allowance for turning up and having a good m&g I do think is going to be very disappointed. \n\nIf both parties were in this for the long term picture, then perhaps more sr\u2019s would last longer because a genuine connection and respect has been built. \n\nAnyway we all have our take that\u2019s what so interesting about the human race.",

Less technology.\n\nThe sugaring of the past 40 years makes up a small percent of what men and women do now. What they do no is a mish mash of sugaring,escorting, and straight up prostitution.\n\nFolks try to find ways to justify it in their minds that's not what it is. Along with coming on subs like this trying to tell you it's not what it is. It is what it is.  \n\n\nMen scoff at allowance because the women don't always act in good faith. He's not going to take the risk that she'll still be around and won't act busy after she gets her allowance. I learned that the hard way. Again we're in different times. Women today are use to strangers sending them money through apps simply based on her showing her face or ass. She didn't have to have soft skills to get it. Same with an allowance upfront. \n\nThe response was PPM. Or pay each time we see each other until. The same hit and quit nature you say men have is prevalent with the women. They'll hit and quit men they never had sex with but got upfront money from.  Hell even men who never heard of this sub reddit have gotten played by a sugar baby and then wised up !  \n\n\nIn the end sugar dating is not going back to the pure mistress/kept woman days of the past. It's now what you and the other person agree to. And what you need to tell yourself at night to sleep better.    \n\n\nSame end goal. Two people trading something wrapped up in nice words.",

            "body": ">I see a lot of posts about SDs complaining about the new demands that women are making, escorts, scammers, etc, but SA is totally different from what it was originally or is supposed to be.  \nSo many men on this forum scoff at allowance. \n\nThats because allowances were for kept women, not for no string sugar babies. SD of the past that gave allowances, were actually dating these women in relationships. Most women nowadays dont want the relationship aspect, they just want the benefits of one. Allowances were given once you were already in an established relationship (not arrangement) a SD gave his GF an allowance to take care of her bills so that she would be more available to him. Allowances were not pre-paid PPM like most women think these days. \n\nA SD didnt give 4 or 8 PPM upfront for the privilege of getting 4 or 8 dates, a SD paid a women's bills or gave an allowance, and they were dating.  With dating, she was available to him as much as both their schedules allowed, and more than likely she was a kept woman, sho she was pretty much available at his beck and call.\n\nIn modern sugar relationships (or arrangements), there's really no benefit to doing things this way, because the majority of women are keeping score. They're only looking out for themselves. thats why they want the allowance, because it benefits them, and for the most part, monthly allowances dont typically have much benefit for SD because eventually many women start to take advantage of them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>They want either weekly allowance or PPM (honestly, but kind of the same thing), they want sex immediately and every meet, while they say they don\u2019t want escorts. \n\nThats because it's reactionary to how women are treating them. Women in the sugar bowl arent treating sugar daddies like Rich boyfriends, and most are treating them like a potential client or personal ATM. The current state of the sugar bowl represents the current state of modern vanilla dating. Most people dont want to put the effort into real relationships, keeping things FWB or NSA.\n\n>  \n>  \n>They are not willing to take on the personal risk (paying an allowance at the beginning) but want a girl who is cool with sex for a PPM knowing she might never see the guy again.\n\nThats because real sugar daddies of the past never had to take any risk of paying an allowance from the beginning. I hate to say it, but most women today would not be happy with the way things were in the past. Sugar daddies were nothing more than wealthy BF's. and they spoiled just like any other vanilla guy would, except they were older and had more money, and because they were dating someone younger and beautiful they could spoil more then the typical guy without money. Women that dated SD might have received gifts, shopping trips or luxury experiences, way before they ever got an allow cane, and 99.9% of the time, you were sleeping with him way before you ever saw a dollar in your pocket. Dont get me wrong, these guys weren't salt daddies, they were very generous with their money, and would spoil the hell out of you, but they weren't paying your bills or giving allowances, until you were in a relationship, already sleeping with them, and he wanted to make it exclusive to take you off the market so to speak, so you would become his kept woman.\n\nYou weren't out there dating vanilla guys, or juggling multiple SD's, you were in 1 relationship, with already established connection and chemistry, before you got an allowance.\n\nFrom what I can see, most women dont want to be treated like an Escort only getting money when they have sex, but at the same time, the hypocrisy is they are acting like escorts, because they want an allowance right from beginning, expecting to be compensated for their time and efforts. Unfortunately you cant have your cake and eat it too. If you want to operate like an escort and get paid for your time, then expect to be treated like escorts by men with money. \n\nIf more women treated sugar dating like a relationship and only met men willing to go on a few platonic dates where both wanted to get to know each other, with zero expectations of sex or money, then you would see whether a guy is truly a SD or not, and truly generous or not and the SD would see whether the women is looking to get 'PAID' or looking for a relationship with financial support.\n\nTruth be told, my longest sugar relationship was also my only sugar relationship where I went on 5 platonic dates over 3 1/2 weeks, I treated her like any other vanilla woman, and courted her, bought her gifts,  paid for her gas and expenses each date, and also help her financially and she never asked for anything, and so she ended up getting  the equivalency of 3-4 PPPM over those 5 dates, because she showed that she was there to get to know me, and wasn't looking to get paid, and because of this she got spoiled more then any previous SB I ever dated. Over the course of our relationship we also had a mixture of intimate and platonic dates, got gifts, occasional shopping trips, had her beauty upkeep taken care of. She made me want to spoil her more by her actions. If women in the bowl would take examples from her and not be so in a rush to 'GET PAID\" for doing nothing other then going on some nice dates getting to know a potential sugar daddy, they would truly get rewarded by the real SD and scare off the guys just in it for the sex.",

By honestly communicating your goals and desires, and focusing on the people that seem to share them, it hopefully ensures that you're both approaching it the same way.  \n\nWhich is why a platonic M&G is so valuable imo.  By that time, you should have a general belief that you're compatible in your goals, and can discuss the remaining desires in person.  If the vibe is good, and you're aligned on the major areas, I think it offers the best chance of success.\n\nIt's not foolproof obv, but you can weed out a lot of the folks you reference in your post.",

I, for example, am perfectly fine with having a M&G and as many non paid no intimacy dates as the woman needs to be comfortable, within reason, before we begin the SR. As I alluded to in another post though, what I want from a SR is the whole package. That involves but is not limited to intimacy. If I'm buying a house, I want a whole house with all the roms. That includes but is not limited to the kitchen. \n\nMen scoff at allowances because it's how we get scammed. We get asked for XXXX up front with the promise of meetups to come (I'll gladly pay you tuesday for a hamburger today) and then get a runaround, put off or simply ghosted. I always tell POTs I'm open to an allowance down the road but we need to build trust first. I don't feel like that's a big ask\n\nI can't speak for all of the men in the bowl but for me, the only time I've ever had a one off with a SB is when she exhibited escort type behavior (need money fast, too quick to jump into bed etc.) or if she ghosted after our first encounter. I actually spend the time getting to know POTs before we meet and decide if this is someone I might want to see more than once. \n\nThe SDs don't make the rules. At least that isn't how it SHOULD work. It should be an agreement that is come to, mutually, between all parties involved and that benefits all parties involved.",

I know there are threads on location factoring in, but as a Canadian SB in a midsize border city, I have never been in a PPM arrangement. It has always been upfront allowance and I have never scammed anyone or been scammed by anyone, so it\u2019s definitely out there for some of us. I think Reddit shows different perspectives but is really just a sampling of the sugar world. I did this for many years and had no idea this group even existed, and all of that time I just assumed my normal was what everyone else was doing too",

That being said, some SB\u2019s have been promised an allowance but after intimacy 1-2x without being paid, their \u201cSD\u201d ghosted.

They will see almost anyone and everyone that will meet their price point. Most SB are more selective. They need to find their SD somewhat attractive and have a connection while escorts don\u2019t have the same privilege. Therefore escorts will most likely have more partners and higher chances of catching an STD. But they do however require protection far more often than SB due to the high volume of partners. \n* SB on the other hand are more likely not to use protection to keep the guy around since the arrangement is usually exclusive. Maybe they want their SD to impregnate them, so they\u2019re set for life. An escort getting impregnated by a random John would be a terrible ROI. \n* Lack of performance. Because most escorts won\u2019t be attracted to their clients, it\u2019s going to be harder for them to \u201cperform\u201d or put on a \u201cgood show.\u201d And also since they\u2019re \u201chigh volume\u201d, it will be harder to give all their clients the same level of performance. SB on the other hand will be better performers due to them being attracted to their SD and low volume. \n* the average SB is more attractive than the average escort \n* Price point may differ. Some SB don\u2019t know their true worth or which bracket they belong in therefore some SD can take advantage of a bargain. There are some escorts that charge xxxx. an hour where he could find the same caliber for xxx only for a SB.\n* Clock watching or kicking you out early. Once your time slot is over which is usually half an hour or an hour, they kick you out. They usually only allow one pop and once you finish, they kick you out even if you have extra time remaining.\n* Higher rates of drug abuse or trauma because of all the men they\u2019ve encountered.",

Full disclosure: I don't interact with as many sugar daddies as you do, but I do have access to that information through my poly wife and other SBs.\n\nMaybe a preponderance of SD wannabes want PPM only... I haven't seen that in these posts.  What I have seen is that SDs expect a sugar baby to earn the trust required to pre-pay a monthly allowance.\n\nThat results in a lot of compromises for both parties.  That's where I see weekly allowances and PPMs come into play... It's risk mitigation and that's what business people excel at.\n\nI think it's fair for both parties to get a taste of what the sugar relationship is going to be and from that standpoint the SB should expect some sugar and so should the SD.  It's really no more complicated than that.  And if both parties are satisfied, they should expand the parameters and enter into a relationship that doesn't involve all this accounting.  And if they're not satisfied they should end it and move on.  Prolonging an introductory period Is just predatory... Unless both parties really do prefer it that way.\n\nThe model I champion is one or two unpaid platonic meet and greets where you workout these details, followed by a paid Orientation (define it how you will but it's usually half an allowance for me and good faith consideration for those earlier dates) to test the waters, up to 6 PPMs, and then prepaid monthly allowance.\n\nExpectations for the sugar baby are clear. Expectations for the sugar daddy are clear. And if she ghosts on the first allowance, it's not going to have been a total loss and it's on me... If I can't figure it out in the first month or two then my filters need to be better.",

It's been PPM or weekly allowance -- at least at the beginning -- for all 6 of those years. It has rarely met any resistance. Given I've seen 4 different women at least for a year, I'd say \"this is how a good arrangement starts.\n\n>They are not willing to take on the personal risk (paying an allowance at the beginning) \n\nI've agree to some variant of this a few times. I've never had the woman continue to show up for a month. I am a fool, but not an idiot. This won't happen again. Recently someone asked; she seemed nice and it could've maybe been a great arrangement. I said no. Had no choice.\n\n>. If this happens to a SB ten times, she has now had sex with ten men one time each.\n\nIf she's 0 for 10 on repeat dates, there's something really off about her screening process. Also, **she is whatever she wants to be.** She isn't defined by the label of another person.\n\n>It\u2019s super disheartening honestly.\n\nI'm sure it is. That cuts both ways but in this case my sympathy with the women. That said, screen better. Ask more questions. Encourage the SD to agree to a weekly arrangement and be proactive about making plans. Be delightful, sexy, the person he can't do without. When anyone puts in effort, I basically reciprocate with more effort.\n\n>When the SDs make the rules and set the pace/money exchange, is that really so mutually beneficial?\n\nThat's an arbitrary standard. If you go to work at a restaurant, the business sets the rules and the pace and the money. And you get paid every week. So, yes, that's mutually beneficial. I think you're conflating the uneven power dynamic with a lack of mutual benefit. That's not accurate.\n\nIt's still quite mutually beneficial for a woman to receive $xyz per month, in a few parts, for what amounts to often not that many hours of effort.\n\n>When a woman sleeps with you expecting a monthly amount, and you end it after one date, how is that acceptable?\n\nI don't know why he's \"ending it\" after one date, but experience leads me a few theories: no effort on her part, lack of chemistry, some unforeseen dealbreaker emerging during the date.\n\nThese are unfortunate... but they do happen... Move on and try to find a better fit? Easy to say, hard to do of course.. but with patience it can happen... Again, I know from experience this is true. Also, once my SR is more established and consistent... I start sending money once or twice a month and drop the ppm part. I think I'm not alone with that.",

I personally don't care if you are married, but the number of men who use that as an excuse to not take you on a date...

I wish we could stop calling women who don't do things like you do by insulting terms.\n\n It's got to hurt the silent lurkers here every time another woman labels them an escort, hooker, prostitute, etc. when they are sugaring with 1 (maybe 2) men and their style is just different than yours.\n\n>It's much more dangerous for women. Nearly all STI are worse for women and we always have the risk of pregnancy no matter what. \n\nI'm not going to argue about STIs. It's certainly true that something like chlamydia is almost irrelevant for men and riskier for women (only if untreated!). But you don't \"always have the risk of pregnancy no matter what\". There are men who have vasectomies. The use of LTRCs gives women autonomy over their reproductive systems.\n\nIf you want to be *technical*, then yes none of these methods are 10,000% foolproof. But vasectomy failures and IUD failures are quite low probability outcomes.\n\n>It's much more dangerous for women\n\nTotally 100% agree with you! That said, I've met a drug dealer and one woman who had a way-too-serious interest in firearms. I've also been stalked and blackmailed (poorly, but that's another story for another day). It's way more dangerous for women.\n\n>Well then you are a good guy! And that's wonderful and I'm sure your SB loves you.

Those of us in the bowl for a long time know a lot about women's experiences. \n\nThat doesn't mean we should set ourselves us to be exploited *by the many women* for whom the entire game is getting an allowance up front and disappearing. The reason why arrangements start off ppm is that it aligns incentives. The \"risk\" of a women showing up for even one extra date she wasn't given allowance for is zero. The risk for men offering one more allowance for a date that doesn't have is zero.\n\nYou may dislike this scenario (I dislike it as well) but it's *the only way* to align incentives.",

Put another way if the SB had intimacy with a SD, collected her PPM, and then didn't have another date with the SD would there be such an outcry? \n\nAgain once money is introduced into the arrangement people's views and approaches change. You can clearly see this from both SBs and SDs for example when they talk about the caliber of partner they are willing to date (SBs always saying they are lowering their standards and SDs saying they are raising their standards). I don't think it is far fetched to think that little things that would be glossed over in vanilla sex would be deal breakers in sugaring. But I could be wrong....",

I had this 1 girl on allowance for awhile and all was good until our last meet. Our last meet up was near the end of the month and she automatically got her allowance of the month on the first. Well the second of the month came and she ended it all and took the allowance knowing full well she planned on ending things. She was good up to this point. Just our last meet up it became obvious that I was just an ATM. Or at least had now evolved that way In her eyes.  We never agreed on x amount if I end it or if she ended.  I was planning on giving her 2 months worth but I never told her that.   She of course tried to get back to me when I guess she couldn't find what she was looking for but the area if one of the highly competitive areas in the country.  For the time investment she was making out great.  Of course I turned her down since I saw her true colors. She never seemed like the type to do that. \nAnother girl ppm to allowance and guess what. Once we went to allowance she got too busy. Or we just saw each other blah. I saw her 1 time that month. I then switched her to ppm for then on and that crap didn't happen again. We did that for over a year then and back to allowances and she behaved this time. \nAnother girl I saw for a few months she wanted up front and I said nope. She then said okay look you can have my car keys my wallet with the allowance and ID to put in safe until then next morning. We did this for awhile since she didn't trust me despite not ever going back on what I said. I helped her out as well in other times when I didn't see her too. So you would think she could trust me after months?  Whatever though it worked fine for us until she ended it out of nowhere without explanation just ghosted me. But ppm so she didn't owe me anything and vice versa.",

My guess is in a few years SRs will all be ppm with half paid upfront and half of the agreed amount paid post date. That would make the most sense for everyone involved. As far as that being transactional - it is. Both sides have made it transactional.

You did not answer that question. \n\nThe fact that you think losing an amount of money is ok as long as the arrangement does not seem to be an interaction with an escort shows how little you value limited resources. \n\nLet me ask you this: whatever your allowance is: your cousin (or best friend or whoever) asked you for that amount as a loan or as payment for doing some sort of work for you for the month or whatever. You give them the money upfront. They, then, do not do the work agreed upon or they take the loan and then have excuses as to why they cannot pay you back. Would you take issue with that?

Also, PPM (if gotten in advance) protects the SB from getting slammed and scammed.  I will only do PPM because I've been rinsed far too many times...never again.  Life is full of risks, and being rejected after one sexual encounter has been an obvious risk for time immemorial.\n\nThe difference between escorting and sugar is intention.  I sympathize with the OP because nobody likes rejection.  If a SD dumping you after one date hurts your self-esteem, sugaring may not be for you.",

I had three out of three SBs look me in the face and tell me how wonderful I was to pay them upfront and how much of this and that and appreciative they were.  Then they promptly rinsed me....\n\nOne was 2 months in. The other I had already been on allowance 3 months. The other was just two weeks into it and she rinsed me. So even over time building 'trust' did not work with these 3. \n\nHaving skills to get the upfront $$ is one thing. Having the honor to adhere to it is another.\n\nThank you for this thread and thank you for being one of the honest ones. I think after 3 years and countless disappointments I have found a great SB. I would have happily paid her upfront, but like I posted in this thread already. She prefers it weekly so she can budget better.",

She got what she came for, the easy money, then when the dates were about to become more intimate, they're gone. \n\nYou can't vet for this, and it seems like it's being promoted on tiktok and other places so I feel the need to become less helpful and more stringent on what I can do for pot SBs. It's not what I'd like to do, it's just silly to be giving away lots of time and money to SBs that are just there to take advantage of kindness. I wish it were otherwise but it's not.",

Those who think so will eventually get screwed over at some point and learn the hard way just how much some one can fake it for that initial meet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven from normal life I've met enough of perfectly professional, competent women from work seemingly sane and put together who are a fucking mess and drama-rosuer in their personal lives deep on the Hot & Crazy scale. You never know someone until you *know* someone. That simply requires time.\n\nThere are plenty of Movie/TV villains who are master manipulators/backstabbers. They are obvious to the audience because it is overacted and we get to see everything from all POV. These people unfortunately exist in real life and no one they backstab initially thought they were less than trustworthy.",

Despite some research on SLF and knowing the norms, I decided I wanted to be a great guy, didn\u2019t want to come off as a John, yada yada.   I met my first SB, gave her a unsolicited gift at the M&G, gave her a PPM for 2 platonic dates, and fortunately for me she was *not* a rinser so we started a long SR.   \n\nThen we broke up and I met another girl.  I knew it was a red flag that she asked for a partial PPM for the M&G, but she justified it since she was a waitress who\u2019d lose income, so I gave in.  The second date came, gave her a PPM and she turned down a kiss at the end.   She texted that she just doesn\u2019t like PDA but she\u2019s really into me. I made it clear I was looking to go somewhere private on the next date, and, oh my, her cell phone bill was due but we can plan an intimate date if I helped her out.   Then the time for the date comes and, omg how could luck be so bad, she has Covid and can\u2019t work could I please help her\u2026.\n\nThat is how rinsing works.  It isn\u2019t a matter of me being mad that I didn\u2019t fuck her.  If she was an honest SB with integrity and just wasn\u2019t into me and she got that money, no big deal, I can afford it.  The issue is that she used me and scammed me, and that money could\u2019ve gone to an actual SB (maybe someone like you even!).  \n\nSo, what do you think I\u2019ve done since?  No M&G fee, ever, and no PPM until she\u2019s in my house or a hotel room.  I\u2019ll never change that.   It\u2019s not because I\u2019m a John and only paying for sex and it\u2019s not because I \u201ccan\u2019t afford\u201d a couple of PPMs, it\u2019s because I was used once and I will *not* be used again.  So, if you don\u2019t like the fact that most SDs will start at PPM and PPM will start when you\u2019re in a bedroom, blame the rinsers, not the SDs.",

Too often these days I get ladies demanding allowances up front. I'm sorry, I've been doing too long, and have too much experience to know what's up. \n\nAnd I'm going to be brutally honest to any lady reading this. For alot of veteran SDs, the problem is not that we cannot afford it. Alot of us could probably afford to waste insane amounts of PPMs to find the right gal. The real issue is that we're wasting time, and as you get older, you'll figure out that time is far more viable then money. I could honestly care less about the money. I could probably waste like 100 ppm meets within the span of a year, the real issue is that for many of us, our time is far more valuable then whatever the PPM rate is. That's really why many SDs are no longer willing to take any kind of risk. Yes, it's callous, but it's the only way I can protect my time investment.  \n\nAnd for many of us, we're all fine with doing non-paid platonic dates.

As stated here, PPM is a defense against rinsers.  SBs defense can be more platonic dates until you can be sure that you and your POTS desires are aligned. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/10pfp57/for_the_sds_ppm_or_allowance/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button\n\n\n\n\n>And what I would like to know is how is this different from escorting? A sugar relationship implies not just mutual benefit, but mutual choice and advantage. When the SDs make the rules and set the pace/money exchange, is that really so mutually beneficial? When a woman sleeps with you expecting a monthly amount, and you end it after one date, how is that acceptable?\n\nIntent is everything.  It does take two to tango and SBs can easily decline and move on or ask for additional platonic dates.  \"Expecting a monthly amount\". That SD may have also been \"Expecting\" a more eager experience, different kinks (could have been avoided with better discussion on both sides),  or just experienced plain sexual incompatiblity. Should they continue a SR that is not mutually beneficial so that the SB can feel better about themselves?",

            "body": "Why is the answer to what is or is not a \"sugar relationship\" for you that the SD pays more money to you and in an allowance format? Why isn't the answer that if you want a relationship that also happens to include sugar that you focus on the relationship part first and let the sugar come later? Why not more non-sugar dates at the start? if you want to get back to what \"SA is supposed to be\" then why not truly return to form of what sugar dating was supposed to be, meaning an older wealthy person taking care of a younger attractive person but without the formal allowance or PPM at all?\n\nI submit that the SBs who want to change it to allowance first and always while shouting the loudest about stingy, salty men who want to start with PPM are those that are looking at sugaring as a way to \"chase their bag\" and have internalized to some level that a man is only good to them as a means to get to money while having to put forth what they consider to be a minimal amount of effort. They're the same ones that view the SD as needing to compensate them for their time because they inherently think they have more value as a person simply for existing and being attractive and that the SDs have less value and \"have\" to sugar date in order to be able to get a date at all.\n\nOn the other side I submit that the men who keep things PPM and staunchly stick to \"the details of the agreed upon arrangement\" and mean that since they provide their PPM that means that's all they have to provide are doing so because they have internalized to some degree that women have no inherent value then as a delivery system of their own gratification. They view themselves as \"deserving\" of the attractive woman's attention and sexual favors and a lot of them resent the PPM they give and therefore build up an attitude of sexual narcissism and entitlement.\n\nIf your goal is truly a sugar **relationship** then the sugar part should be secondary and not the focus of your efforts. You should be viewing intimacy in all of it's forms and not just as sexual intimacy. If you want to date with boundaries then you need to figure and have an honest talk with yourself what it is you are looking for, what is you're offering and what level(s) of intimacy you're willing to provide and engage in.",

In the god(good ole days) everyone on Seeking Arrangements were sugar daters or scammers. Now Seeking has opened the floodgates to all come-ers. As to screening you must be overly diligent in screening Pot SDs and sticking to the platonic M&G followed by a separate date for intimacy. Monthly prepaid allowance up front is a non starter for 99+% of SDs. It is just not going to happen with rare exceptions. Real SDs will hang in there with a POT they are really interested in,where players generally will move on to an easier lay if you trouble them with platonic anything.\n\nDoes 10 failed one -time sex meets mean you are an escort? Not if the intent is a SD relationship and your screening is poor. Some real SDs will move on if the attraction is not there the first date. So maybe SBs should reexamine their experience. SDs have a high bar in wanting an enhanced sexual experienced since their vanilla life is usually adequate if not exciting. Poor first date sex can turn off a well meaning SD unfortunately. Of course your area might be rife with fakes who are just out for escort experience though with a low volume non pro.",

Both very pretty girls the first was 18-22 when i was with her. The second was 22 for 4.5 mos i saw her. Paid half the times i saw her. Last one i had ltr sb wise i saw her for 7.5 mos. Would see her about 3 times a month 24 years old she is the only one that had me over her place outta the 3 consistently.  They all slept over early on . All asked if i wanted them to sleep over. \n\nI had one of my first sbs when she was 21 first time was free. Second time i started giving her money. Saw her but not consistently for 6.5 mos, not my fault she sometimes wasn't available and sometimes i wasnt .\n\nMy current main sb is 19 and she sleeps over i've been seeing her 3 times a month for the past 3 months. My point in all this ,is when a sb is dope. Personality,  looks , sexually.  Men will see them. We have so many options. Especially if you have a decent personality as SD. If you give them an allowance it is extremely one sided. Too many entitled Women who think that's the norm. Ik full well it isnt.",

SA created the transactional nature of modern sugar relationships.\n\nIn the past most sugar relationships were nothing more then vanilla relationships with a age gap and wealth disparity. in the past, traditional gender roles was part of all dating and almost all men regardless of wealth,, courted and spoiled a women until she eventually slept with him. Sugar babies of the past were either sugar GFs or Spoiled GFs, not NSA fuck buddies or personal escorts. \n\nMost sugar babies had experience SD, and received spoiling in the form of experiences, gifts and shopping. If and when a SB became exclusive or a kept woman then she also had her finances covered. \n\nThese were traditional sugar relationships, modern sugar dating took the arrangement aspect of making a friends with benefits arrangement with the payment structure of sex work. Modern sugar dating is a hybrid of traditional sugar and prostitution with many gray areas in between.\n\nI don\u2019t think any new terms need to be made\u2026 either you\u2019re looking for a modern NSA arrangement or you\u2019re looking for traditional sugar or maybe is something in between.",

            "body": "I don't think it's very different from escorting or straight out prostitution except for the lack of upfront honesty of intention perhaps. Partly that's the fault of the law (you go to jail for being honest about just wanting to pay or get paid for it) and partly the fault of the participants. It's on both because the SD may be manipulating it in that direction but the SB is accepting it. \n\nAnd let's not forget that any SD or SB has probably had multiple experiences where they were perfectly happy with the arrangement as far as time and allowance (actual, discussed or planned) but after a first date simply decided this is not their person for an SR. \n\nThe other point I'll make though, is that there is an analogy to ordinary, vanilla dating, maybe back in the day, but even today to an extent. What I described in the last paragraph - deciding \"no\" after a first date -  is common to every type of relationship in existence, including business, friendship, as well as dating or SR. Here's what I mean in detail...\n\nImagine the now-quaint-seeming early to mid 20th Century: The usual rule was maybe arm-in-arm on first date after dinner, a kiss on the second date. Maybe 'heavy petting' or sex on the third or fourth. And there were still many virgin brides, waiting for the ring. Many didn't get past the first or second date because they decided this was not whom they wanted. Others quit after the first or second time having sex. Again, they didn't want to stay, for purely personal reasons. But remember, no money was involved, unless, sizing up someone as a possible mate they needed a couple of dates to get a good idea of their wealth, income, professional trajectory and family connections! Then there's this other situation:\n\nWhen I was young and dating in the late 20th Century, there was a fairly well known saying among those of us with the ability to spend a little: \"Dinner Whores\", at least in NYC. These were women that would accept a date just to get the free meal and maybe the show or movie. Getting a second or third date was not possible because they knew affection was required by then.\n\nSo, you see, in my view, there's common behavior here from both men and women. The fact that we are adding an allowance or any other form of transaction or payment into the mix doesn't necessarily mean anything. In other words, this isn't really about the behavior of men or women, but of behavior common to both depending upon the perceived power - who is trying to get what from whom and when.\n\nI hope this makes sense. What I'm advocating for is an clear and unbiased, non-gendered view of the economic dance involved in dating. Clearly sex is commodified, but I am arguing that it always has been and understanding how that works is your key to sanity. If we are each willing to know ourselves what we are really looking for, and to be honest about it to ourselves first, and others second, I think everyone would be more satisfied.",

            "body": "In the Chicago market on Seeking, it seems that there are a lot of guys on there who are not interested in building connection (platonic meetings) to get to truly know and trust the person, in order to even get to a real long term SR.\n\nMajority of the men who message me always start first contact with: Hi, Have you been in an arrangement before?  What are you seeking? How much is your \\*PPM? As if this is just a straight up negotiation, as if they are just shopping for something that they can buy, as soon as they get the right price that they are looking for... (A turn off).\n\n\\*I didn't even know what a PPM was, I had to look on Urban Dictionary before I could respond, to make sure I knew what I was talking about.\n\n(I now never reply to or entertain messages that start off like this).\n\nAfter reading this thread for the last hour and a half, I have genuinely come to understand the men's side: their logic and why they are (now) exceptionally leery of giving an allowance. This is despite me also believing that a lot of men don't want to give an allowance (at any point) because they genuinely do just want to stay on PPM, so that they can keep costs, risks, and commitment/obligations down/low...As well as so they can sexually \"sample\", for lack of a better word lots of different women... most of these men sincerely do not want long term SR, nor is that what they are looking for.\n\nI as a woman absolutely want long term with the man I do this with, because I prioritize, value and appreciate consistency, stability, reliability, and predictability. All things the man should want and value on his side as well from the woman that he does this with.\n\nHere is why I am opposed to PPM: I personally can not just meet a complete stranger, and have enough mental and emotional connection to him within 30-60 minutes of having met him to have an amazing sexual encounter with him.  I would be/feel nervous, awkward, and somewhat frightened and scared at the whole encounter. (And I am a grown woman). It would be completely nerve wrecking. Why do men think that this is easy for someone to do, just because they want to \"sugar\" date? I would be very uncomfortable with this scenario, so wouldn't do it... but let's assume I would do it, in efforts to progress to getting in a long term SR.\n\nThe PPM encounter will not be amazing, as far as (I) or the SD is concerned... he didn't have a good experience- because I was nervous, awkward and scared- now he doesn't want to move forward- because he thinks we aren't going to be a good match sexually... So now it's all over before it even started- and I am thinking I wish I didn't do this- even though he gave me money. I only want to have sex with a man that I am going to be consistently sleeping with- because I don't want to sleep with multiple men, only 1 man.\n\nI can see this happening to a lot of girls. They want to get in an SR, but men want to do PPM in order to get to there (allegedly), but it never gets to there- for one reason or another. This is why I personally don't want to, and don't do PPM.\n\nI will just take longer weeding through, or try to meet generous men via other channels and methods.\n\nI am willing to come out to meet (multiple times) for \"platonic\" meetings, don't need a gift or money to show up- to get to know this person, and work to build trust, rapport and connection...\n\nMost men don't want to go through this process though- at least  it seems in the Chicago market.\n\nI wish Seeking would allow you to screen for men who don't mind getting to know each other first (say 3-4 meetings- or whenever people feel COMFORTABLE) prior to any money or sex being introduced to the situation.\n\nIf the true/real goal is to have a long term SR with 1 woman why does it seem like the men so opposed to this strategy?!\n\nThe one and only meet and greet that I went to, the man was 73. I am in my 30s, very polished, fit/slim, and well maintained. I never bought up money, gift, or allowance. I showed up with my dynamic personality and charismatic wit on high display. The banter back and forth was A1, and we got along really well..not 1 silent or awkward pause.\n\nAt the end of  the meal he pulled out money to give me money for showing up. I told him he didn't have to. I didn't (know) to expect anything, or know that this was protocol/customary for the man to do. He insisted and said to use for my valet. He gave me X. I have no clue if this is average, low or high for Chicago market. He stated that he would like to carry on with me in an \"arrangement\", and asked me what I felt was a \"good allowance\", to which I told him what I would \"Seek\" pun intended. He then said: well, I can't physically, have sex with you, so I would be able to do X amount (50% less than the number I said). He told me: I would want you to massage me nude, and then play with yourself in front of me every time we met up (at his place), which he wanted to meet 3x per week.\n\nThoughts?",

However, why should we gamble and pay a full price for an appetizer? \n\nI'd like to ask the SBs here a question about this. The above is something I've done. If I am interested in a POT SB either before or after an M'n'G I'll suggest starting with platonic dates and discuss a specific PPM for a specific type of date, meaning, is it just lunch, or dinner, or an activity or a combination. I find this let's me very freely and openly get to know someone, break the ice, go beyond the nervousness and anxiety of expectations. After 1 - 3 platonic dates, things either warm up or you walk, either one of you. But if you're going to continue you can then increase the PPM or go to an allowance. How do you SBs or even other SDs feel about doing this? Admittedly, I'm older; I've had a fulfilling life; many lovely relationships; I love people; so, I'm in no rush. I don't care for any sort of dishonesty or anxiety, I want to be able to communicate freely on any topic. I am still very active (business and study) and don't usually want to go out for fun or entertainment than a couple of times per week. This might not be for everyone, but I'd like to get reactions -bYMMV!",

What most of these girls don't realize that once a guy is paying you the dynamic changes immediately. I have said it before it is one thing to pay for friends and a whole other thing to pay to be friends.\n\nMost (all?) of these girls wouldn't want to date a rich guy who take them out to nice restaurants, expensive venues, and trips because they are all about the money and apparently they get all that in their vanilla relationships with their 20 year old BFs.\n\nI am vanilla dating a 29 y.o. and she is still shocked that I don't expect to go dutch or will pay for her tickets when we go out and she doesn't have to venmo me back.\n\nI guess she must have been very unlucky to have not met any of those 20 year old guys taking their girls to Michellin restaurants....",

The normalization of ppm and hotel meets and quick dates changed the older fashioned SD types. I look at like Anna Nicole Smith getting married to an 89yr old billionaire as an example. The idea of meeting an older wealthy man who wants to spoil and pay allowance for long-term commitment (and some sex ofc) is not really common anymore unless you\u2019re like a super big name model. I personally don\u2019t like ppm or hotel meets, and I definitely don\u2019t just want to become someone\u2019s girlfriend on the side because they don\u2019t love their wife anymore. Sugaring can be really hard and trying to find the perfect fit for you may take a long time! Be patient and the right person may come along. I too am still searching for my \u201cperfect fit\u201d but I understand that it may take months and even years. Good luck on your journey!!",

My guess is in a few years SRs will all be ppm with half paid upfront and half of the agreed amount paid post date. That would make the most sense for everyone involved. As far as that being transactional - it is. Both sides have made it transactional.

They will see almost anyone and everyone that will meet their price point. Most SB are more selective. They need to find their SD somewhat attractive and have a connection while escorts don\u2019t have the same privilege. Therefore escorts will most likely have more partners and higher chances of catching an STD. But they do however require protection far more often than SB due to the high volume of partners. \n* SB on the other hand are more likely not to use protection to keep the guy around since the arrangement is usually exclusive. Maybe they want their SD to impregnate them, so they\u2019re set for life. An escort getting impregnated by a random John would be a terrible ROI. \n* Lack of performance. Because most escorts won\u2019t be attracted to their clients, it\u2019s going to be harder for them to \u201cperform\u201d or put on a \u201cgood show.\u201d And also since they\u2019re \u201chigh volume\u201d, it will be harder to give all their clients the same level of performance. SB on the other hand will be better performers due to them being attracted to their SD and low volume. \n* the average SB is more attractive than the average escort \n* Price point may differ. Some SB don\u2019t know their true worth or which bracket they belong in therefore some SD can take advantage of a bargain. There are some escorts that charge xxxx. an hour where he could find the same caliber for xxx only for a SB.\n* Clock watching or kicking you out early. Once your time slot is over which is usually half an hour or an hour, they kick you out. They usually only allow one pop and once you finish, they kick you out even if you have extra time remaining.\n* Higher rates of drug abuse or trauma because of all the men they\u2019ve encountered.",

I personally don't care if you are married, but the number of men who use that as an excuse to not take you on a date... Then you aren't sugaring.\n\nThere are a fair number of homebodies on Seeking who prefer to just hang out, watch some Netflix, talk, have sex, maybe order some food... The ones I've actually met aren't \"escorts\" in any real sense of that word. I wish we could stop calling women who don't do things like you do by insulting terms.\n\n It's got to hurt the silent lurkers here every time another woman labels them an escort, hooker, prostitute, etc. when they are sugaring with 1 (maybe 2) men and their style is just different than yours.\n\n>It's much more dangerous for women. Nearly all STI are worse for women and we always have the risk of pregnancy no matter what. \n\nI'm not going to argue about STIs. It's certainly true that something like chlamydia is almost irrelevant for men and riskier for women (only if untreated!). But you don't \"always have the risk of pregnancy no matter what\". There are men who have vasectomies. The use of LTRCs gives women autonomy over their reproductive systems.\n\nIf you want to be *technical*, then yes none of these methods are 10,000% foolproof. But vasectomy failures and IUD failures are quite low probability outcomes.\n\n>It's much more dangerous for women\n\nTotally 100% agree with you! That said, I've met a drug dealer and one woman who had a way-too-serious interest in firearms. I've also been stalked and blackmailed (poorly, but that's another story for another day). It's way more dangerous for women.\n\n>Well then you are a good guy! And that's wonderful and I'm sure your SB loves you. I meet great guys who the idea of not gifting a woman they want to be intimate is foreign to them, they truly don't understand and they're stand up guys. \n\nI try to be a good guy. I've also made sure women *that never asked* received an allowance anyway.\n\n> It's reckless to down play women's experiences. It's apple's and oranges.\n\nNo one is playing down women's experiences. Those of us in the bowl for a long time know a lot about women's experiences. \n\nThat doesn't mean we should set ourselves us to be exploited *by the many women* for whom the entire game is getting an allowance up front and disappearing. The reason why arrangements start off ppm is that it aligns incentives. The \"risk\" of a women showing up for even one extra date she wasn't given allowance for is zero. The risk for men offering one more allowance for a date that doesn't have is zero.\n\nYou may dislike this scenario (I dislike it as well) but it's *the only way* to align incentives.",

I had this 1 girl on allowance for awhile and all was good until our last meet. Our last meet up was near the end of the month and she automatically got her allowance of the month on the first. Well the second of the month came and she ended it all and took the allowance knowing full well she planned on ending things. She was good up to this point. Just our last meet up it became obvious that I was just an ATM. Or at least had now evolved that way In her eyes.  We never agreed on x amount if I end it or if she ended.  I was planning on giving her 2 months worth but I never told her that.   She of course tried to get back to me when I guess she couldn't find what she was looking for but the area if one of the highly competitive areas in the country.  For the time investment she was making out great.  Of course I turned her down since I saw her true colors. She never seemed like the type to do that. \nAnother girl ppm to allowance and guess what. Once we went to allowance she got too busy. Or we just saw each other blah. I saw her 1 time that month. I then switched her to ppm for then on and that crap didn't happen again. We did that for over a year then and back to allowances and she behaved this time. \nAnother girl I saw for a few months she wanted up front and I said nope. She then said okay look you can have my car keys my wallet with the allowance and ID to put in safe until then next morning. We did this for awhile since she didn't trust me despite not ever going back on what I said. I helped her out as well in other times when I didn't see her too. So you would think she could trust me after months?  Whatever though it worked fine for us until she ended it out of nowhere without explanation just ghosted me. But ppm so she didn't owe me anything and vice versa.",

My guess is in a few years SRs will all be ppm with half paid upfront and half of the agreed amount paid post date. That would make the most sense for everyone involved.

The second camp is what I feel is more genuine. Those who have been burned by past experiences. I did not say reading about the subject hurt me. I simply said that personally I have never encountered that type of offer and would not accept it",

Because you don't like the connotation that PPM evokes?\n\nWell, there are others for whom PPM works best.\n\nI asked you before why a man would want to have a PPM arrangement. You did not answer that question. \n\nThe fact that you think losing an amount of money is ok as long as the arrangement does not seem to be an interaction with an escort shows how little you value limited resources. \n\nLet me ask you this: whatever your allowance is: your cousin (or best friend or whoever) asked you for that amount as a loan or as payment for doing some sort of work for you for the month or whatever. You give them the money upfront. They, then, do not do the work agreed upon or they take the loan and then have excuses as to why they cannot pay you back. Would you take issue with that?

I had three out of three SBs look me in the face and tell me how wonderful I was to pay them upfront and how much of this and that and appreciative they were.  Then they promptly rinsed me....\n\nOne was 2 months in. The other I had already been on allowance 3 months. The other was just two weeks into it and she rinsed me. So even over time building 'trust' did not work with these 3. \n\nHaving skills to get the upfront $$ is one thing. Having the honor to adhere to it is another.\n\nThank you for this thread and thank you for being one of the honest ones. I think after 3 years and countless disappointments I have found a great SB. I would have happily paid her upfront, but like I posted in this thread already. She prefers it weekly so she can budget better.",

Those who think so will eventually get screwed over at some point and learn the hard way just how much some one can fake it for that initial meet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven from normal life I've met enough of perfectly professional, competent women from work seemingly sane and put together who are a fucking mess and drama-rosuer in their personal lives deep on the Hot & Crazy scale. You never know someone until you *know* someone. That simply requires time.\n\nThere are plenty of Movie/TV villains who are master manipulators/backstabbers. They are obvious to the audience because it is overacted and we get to see everything from all POV. These people unfortunately exist in real life and no one they backstab initially thought they were less than trustworthy.",

Despite some research on SLF and knowing the norms, I decided I wanted to be a great guy, didn\u2019t want to come off as a John, yada yada.   I met my first SB, gave her a unsolicited gift at the M&G, gave her a PPM for 2 platonic dates, and fortunately for me she was *not* a rinser so we started a long SR.   \n\nThen we broke up and I met another girl.  I knew it was a red flag that she asked for a partial PPM for the M&G, but she justified it since she was a waitress who\u2019d lose income, so I gave in.  The second date came, gave her a PPM and she turned down a kiss at the end.   She texted that she just doesn\u2019t like PDA but she\u2019s really into me. I made it clear I was looking to go somewhere private on the next date, and, oh my, her cell phone bill was due but we can plan an intimate date if I helped her out.   Then the time for the date comes and, omg how could luck be so bad, she has Covid and can\u2019t work could I please help her\u2026.\n\nThat is how rinsing works.  It isn\u2019t a matter of me being mad that I didn\u2019t fuck her.  If she was an honest SB with integrity and just wasn\u2019t into me and she got that money, no big deal, I can afford it.  The issue is that she used me and scammed me, and that money could\u2019ve gone to an actual SB (maybe someone like you even!).  \n\nSo, what do you think I\u2019ve done since?  No M&G fee, ever, and no PPM until she\u2019s in my house or a hotel room.  I\u2019ll never change that.   It\u2019s not because I\u2019m a John and only paying for sex and it\u2019s not because I \u201ccan\u2019t afford\u201d a couple of PPMs, it\u2019s because I was used once and I will *not* be used again.  So, if you don\u2019t like the fact that most SDs will start at PPM and PPM will start when you\u2019re in a bedroom, blame the rinsers, not the SDs.",

However, the sugar bowl has been really messed up recently because of some cultural reasons. I've been rinsed a couple of times far more often in the past two years alone then I have in the past 4-5 years before that.\n\nThere's a reason why veteran SDs are no longer willing to do allowances anymore, not without a long term established relationship. Too often these days I get ladies demanding allowances up front. I'm sorry, I've been doing too long, and have too much experience to know what's up. \n\nAnd I'm going to be brutally honest to any lady reading this. For alot of veteran SDs, the problem is not that we cannot afford it. Alot of us could probably afford to waste insane amounts of PPMs to find the right gal. The real issue is that we're wasting time, and as you get older, you'll figure out that time is far more viable then money. I could honestly care less about the money. I could probably waste like 100 ppm meets within the span of a year, the real issue is that for many of us, our time is far more valuable then whatever the PPM rate is. That's really why many SDs are no longer willing to take any kind of risk. Yes, it's callous, but it's the only way I can protect my time investment.  \n\nAnd for many of us, we're all fine with doing non-paid platonic dates. As many times as you want as long as you're not asking for an envelope at the end of the night.",

SA created the transactional nature of modern sugar relationships.\n\nIn the past most sugar relationships were nothing more then vanilla relationships with a age gap and wealth disparity. in the past, traditional gender roles was part of all dating and almost all men regardless of wealth,, courted and spoiled a women until she eventually slept with him. Sugar babies of the past were either sugar GFs or Spoiled GFs, not NSA fuck buddies or personal escorts. \n\nMost sugar babies had experience SD, and received spoiling in the form of experiences, gifts and shopping. If and when a SB became exclusive or a kept woman then she also had her finances covered. \n\nThese were traditional sugar relationships, modern sugar dating took the arrangement aspect of making a friends with benefits arrangement with the payment structure of sex work. Modern sugar dating is a hybrid of traditional sugar and prostitution with many gray areas in between.\n\nI don\u2019t think any new terms need to be made\u2026 either you\u2019re looking for a modern NSA arrangement or you\u2019re looking for traditional sugar or maybe is something in between.",

The normalization of ppm and hotel meets and quick dates changed the older fashioned SD types. I look at like Anna Nicole Smith getting married to an 89yr old billionaire as an example. The idea of meeting an older wealthy man who wants to spoil and pay allowance for long-term commitment (and some sex ofc) is not really common anymore unless you\u2019re like a super big name model. I personally don\u2019t like ppm or hotel meets, and I definitely don\u2019t just want to become someone\u2019s girlfriend on the side because they don\u2019t love their wife anymore. Sugaring can be really hard and trying to find the perfect fit for you may take a long time! Be patient and the right person may come along. I too am still searching for my \u201cperfect fit\u201d but I understand that it may take months and even years. Good luck on your journey!!",

My guess is in a few years SRs will all be ppm with half paid upfront and half of the agreed amount paid post date. That would make the most sense for everyone involved. As far as that being transactional - it is. Both sides have made it transactional.

They will see almost anyone and everyone that will meet their price point. Most SB are more selective. They need to find their SD somewhat attractive and have a connection while escorts don\u2019t have the same privilege. Therefore escorts will most likely have more partners and higher chances of catching an STD. But they do however require protection far more often than SB due to the high volume of partners. \n* SB on the other hand are more likely not to use protection to keep the guy around since the arrangement is usually exclusive. Maybe they want their SD to impregnate them, so they\u2019re set for life. An escort getting impregnated by a random John would be a terrible ROI. \n* Lack of performance. Because most escorts won\u2019t be attracted to their clients, it\u2019s going to be harder for them to \u201cperform\u201d or put on a \u201cgood show.\u201d And also since they\u2019re \u201chigh volume\u201d, it will be harder to give all their clients the same level of performance. SB on the other hand will be better performers due to them being attracted to their SD and low volume. \n* the average SB is more attractive than the average escort \n* Price point may differ. Some SB don\u2019t know their true worth or which bracket they belong in therefore some SD can take advantage of a bargain. There are some escorts that charge xxxx. an hour where he could find the same caliber for xxx only for a SB.\n* Clock watching or kicking you out early. Once your time slot is over which is usually half an hour or an hour, they kick you out. They usually only allow one pop and once you finish, they kick you out even if you have extra time remaining.\n* Higher rates of drug abuse or trauma because of all the men they\u2019ve encountered.",

You can't know if they only wanted one time if you never actually go through with it. I'm sure you filter out a lot of chum. And a few tuna.\n\n>. I personally don't care if you are married, but the number of men who use that as an excuse to not take you on a date... Then you aren't sugaring.\n\nThere are a fair number of homebodies on Seeking who prefer to just hang out, watch some Netflix, talk, have sex, maybe order some food... The ones I've actually met aren't \"escorts\" in any real sense of that word. I wish we could stop calling women who don't do things like you do by insulting terms.\n\n It's got to hurt the silent lurkers here every time another woman labels them an escort, hooker, prostitute, etc. when they are sugaring with 1 (maybe 2) men and their style is just different than yours.\n\n>It's much more dangerous for women. Nearly all STI are worse for women and we always have the risk of pregnancy no matter what. \n\nI'm not going to argue about STIs. It's certainly true that something like chlamydia is almost irrelevant for men and riskier for women (only if untreated!). But you don't \"always have the risk of pregnancy no matter what\". There are men who have vasectomies. The use of LTRCs gives women autonomy over their reproductive systems.\n\nIf you want to be *technical*, then yes none of these methods are 10,000% foolproof. But vasectomy failures and IUD failures are quite low probability outcomes.\n\n>It's much more dangerous for women\n\nTotally 100% agree with you! That said, I've met a drug dealer and one woman who had a way-too-serious interest in firearms. I've also been stalked and blackmailed (poorly, but that's another story for another day). It's way more dangerous for women.\n\n>Well then you are a good guy! And that's wonderful and I'm sure your SB loves you. I meet great guys who the idea of not gifting a woman they want to be intimate is foreign to them, they truly don't understand and they're stand up guys. \n\nI try to be a good guy. I've also made sure women *that never asked* received an allowance anyway.\n\n> It's reckless to down play women's experiences. It's apple's and oranges.\n\nNo one is playing down women's experiences. Those of us in the bowl for a long time know a lot about women's experiences. \n\nThat doesn't mean we should set ourselves us to be exploited *by the many women* for whom the entire game is getting an allowance up front and disappearing. The reason why arrangements start off ppm is that it aligns incentives. The \"risk\" of a women showing up for even one extra date she wasn't given allowance for is zero. The risk for men offering one more allowance for a date that doesn't have is zero.\n\nYou may dislike this scenario (I dislike it as well) but it's *the only way* to align incentives.",

Put another way if the SB had intimacy with a SD, collected her PPM, and then didn't have another date with the SD would there be such an outcry? \n\nAgain once money is introduced into the arrangement people's views and approaches change. You can clearly see this from both SBs and SDs for example when they talk about the caliber of partner they are willing to date (SBs always saying they are lowering their standards and SDs saying they are raising their standards). I don't think it is far fetched to think that little things that would be glossed over in vanilla sex would be deal breakers in sugaring. But I could be wrong....",

Well the second of the month came and she ended it all and took the allowance knowing full well she planned on ending things. She was good up to this point. Just our last meet up it became obvious that I was just an ATM. Or at least had now evolved that way In her eyes.  We never agreed on x amount if I end it or if she ended.  I was planning on giving her 2 months worth but I never told her that.   She of course tried to get back to me when I guess she couldn't find what she was looking for but the area if one of the highly competitive areas in the country.  For the time investment she was making out great.  Of course I turned her down since I saw her true colors. She never seemed like the type to do that. \nAnother girl ppm to allowance and guess what. Once we went to allowance she got too busy. Or we just saw each other blah. I saw her 1 time that month. I then switched her to ppm for then on and that crap didn't happen again. We did that for over a year then and back to allowances and she behaved this time. \nAnother girl I saw for a few months she wanted up front and I said nope. She then said okay look you can have my car keys my wallet with the allowance and ID to put in safe until then next morning. We did this for awhile since she didn't trust me despite not ever going back on what I said. I helped her out as well in other times when I didn't see her too.

You did not answer that question. \n\nThe fact that you think losing an amount of money is ok as long as the arrangement does not seem to be an interaction with an escort shows how little you value limited resources. \n\nLet me ask you this: whatever your allowance is: your cousin (or best friend or whoever) asked you for that amount as a loan or as payment for doing some sort of work for you for the month or whatever. You give them the money upfront. They, then, do not do the work agreed upon or they take the loan and then have excuses as to why they cannot pay you back. Would you take issue with that?

I had three out of three SBs look me in the face and tell me how wonderful I was to pay them upfront and how much of this and that and appreciative they were.  Then they promptly rinsed me....\n\nOne was 2 months in. The other I had already been on allowance 3 months. The other was just two weeks into it and she rinsed me. So even over time building 'trust' did not work with these 3. \n\nHaving skills to get the upfront $$ is one thing. Having the honor to adhere to it is another.\n\nThank you for this thread and thank you for being one of the honest ones. I think after 3 years and countless disappointments I have found a great SB. I would have happily paid her upfront, but like I posted in this thread already. She prefers it weekly so she can budget better.",

She got what she came for, the easy money, then when the dates were about to become more intimate, they're gone. \n\nYou can't vet for this, and it seems like it's being promoted on tiktok and other places so I feel the need to become less helpful and more stringent on what I can do for pot SBs.

Those who think so will eventually get screwed over at some point and learn the hard way just how much some one can fake it for that initial meet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven from normal life I've met enough of perfectly professional, competent women from work seemingly sane and put together who are a fucking mess and drama-rosuer in their personal lives deep on the Hot & Crazy scale. You never know someone until you *know* someone. That simply requires time.\n\nThere are plenty of Movie/TV villains who are master manipulators/backstabbers. They are obvious to the audience because it is overacted and we get to see everything from all POV. These people unfortunately exist in real life and no one they backstab initially thought they were less than trustworthy.",

Despite some research on SLF and knowing the norms, I decided I wanted to be a great guy, didn\u2019t want to come off as a John, yada yada.   I met my first SB, gave her a unsolicited gift at the M&G, gave her a PPM for 2 platonic dates, and fortunately for me she was *not* a rinser so we started a long SR.   \n\nThen we broke up and I met another girl.  I knew it was a red flag that she asked for a partial PPM for the M&G, but she justified it since she was a waitress who\u2019d lose income, so I gave in.  The second date came, gave her a PPM and she turned down a kiss at the end.   She texted that she just doesn\u2019t like PDA but she\u2019s really into me. I made it clear I was looking to go somewhere private on the next date, and, oh my, her cell phone bill was due but we can plan an intimate date if I helped her out.   Then the time for the date comes and, omg how could luck be so bad, she has Covid and can\u2019t work could I please help her\u2026.\n\nThat is how rinsing works.  It isn\u2019t a matter of me being mad that I didn\u2019t fuck her.  If she was an honest SB with integrity and just wasn\u2019t into me and she got that money, no big deal, I can afford it.  The issue is that she used me and scammed me, and that money could\u2019ve gone to an actual SB (maybe someone like you even!).  \n\nSo, what do you think I\u2019ve done since?  No M&G fee, ever, and no PPM until she\u2019s in my house or a hotel room.  I\u2019ll never change that.   It\u2019s not because I\u2019m a John and only paying for sex and it\u2019s not because I \u201ccan\u2019t afford\u201d a couple of PPMs, it\u2019s because I was used once and I will *not* be used again.  So, if you don\u2019t like the fact that most SDs will start at PPM and PPM will start when you\u2019re in a bedroom, blame the rinsers, not the SDs.",

However, the sugar bowl has been really messed up recently because of some cultural reasons. I've been rinsed a couple of times far more often in the past two years alone then I have in the past 4-5 years before that.\n\nThere's a reason why veteran SDs are no longer willing to do allowances anymore, not without a long term established relationship. Too often these days I get ladies demanding allowances up front. I'm sorry, I've been doing too long, and have too much experience to know what's up. \n\nAnd I'm going to be brutally honest to any lady reading this. For alot of veteran SDs, the problem is not that we cannot afford it. Alot of us could probably afford to waste insane amounts of PPMs to find the right gal. The real issue is that we're wasting time, and as you get older, you'll figure out that time is far more viable then money. I could honestly care less about the money. I could probably waste like 100 ppm meets within the span of a year, the real issue is that for many of us, our time is far more valuable then whatever the PPM rate is. That's really why many SDs are no longer willing to take any kind of risk. Yes, it's callous, but it's the only way I can protect my time investment.  \n\nAnd for many of us, we're all fine with doing non-paid platonic dates.

Sugar babies of the past were either sugar GFs or Spoiled GFs, not NSA fuck buddies or personal escorts. \n\nMost sugar babies had experience SD, and received spoiling in the form of experiences, gifts and shopping. If and when a SB became exclusive or a kept woman then she also had her finances covered. \n\nThese were traditional sugar relationships, modern sugar dating took the arrangement aspect of making a friends with benefits arrangement with the payment structure of sex work.

The normalization of ppm and hotel meets and quick dates changed the older fashioned SD types. I look at like Anna Nicole Smith getting married to an 89yr old billionaire as an example. The idea of meeting an older wealthy man who wants to spoil and pay allowance for long-term commitment (and some sex ofc) is not really common anymore unless you\u2019re like a super big name model. I personally don\u2019t like ppm or hotel meets, and I definitely don\u2019t just want to become someone\u2019s girlfriend on the side because they don\u2019t love their wife anymore. Sugaring can be really hard and trying to find the perfect fit for you may take a long time! Be patient and the right person may come along. I too am still searching for my \u201cperfect fit\u201d but I understand that it may take months and even years. Good luck on your journey!!",

How many times have you seen advice akin to \"well if she dashes after you give her the ppm you are just out the ppm\".

My guess is in a few years SRs will all be ppm with half paid upfront and half of the agreed amount paid post date. That would make the most sense for everyone involved. As far as that being transactional - it is. Both sides have made it transactional. I mean terms like experience daddies are thrown out as insults now a days when initially that was the main component of it all based on what I have read.",

They will see almost anyone and everyone that will meet their price point. Most SB are more selective. They need to find their SD somewhat attractive and have a connection while escorts don\u2019t have the same privilege. Therefore escorts will most likely have more partners and higher chances of catching an STD. But they do however require protection far more often than SB due to the high volume of partners. \n* SB on the other hand are more likely not to use protection to keep the guy around since the arrangement is usually exclusive. Maybe they want their SD to impregnate them, so they\u2019re set for life. An escort getting impregnated by a random John would be a terrible ROI. \n* Lack of performance. Because most escorts won\u2019t be attracted to their clients, it\u2019s going to be harder for them to \u201cperform\u201d or put on a \u201cgood show.\u201d And also since they\u2019re \u201chigh volume\u201d, it will be harder to give all their clients the same level of performance. SB on the other hand will be better performers due to them being attracted to their SD and low volume. \n* the average SB is more attractive than the average escort \n* Price point may differ. Some SB don\u2019t know their true worth or which bracket they belong in therefore some SD can take advantage of a bargain. There are some escorts that charge xxxx. an hour where he could find the same caliber for xxx only for a SB.\n* Clock watching or kicking you out early. Once your time slot is over which is usually half an hour or an hour, they kick you out. They usually only allow one pop and once you finish, they kick you out even if you have extra time remaining.\n* Higher rates of drug abuse or trauma because of all the men they\u2019ve encountered.",

Unless there was also an agreement that there would be a minimum number of dates (which I think we can both agree is unreasonable for both parties to adhere to) I still see nothing wrong here. Put another way if the SB had intimacy with a SD, collected her PPM, and then didn't have another date with the SD would there be such an outcry? \n\nAgain once money is introduced into the arrangement people's views and approaches change. You can clearly see this from both SBs and SDs for example when they talk about the caliber of partner they are willing to date (SBs always saying they are lowering their standards and SDs saying they are raising their standards). I don't think it is far fetched to think that little things that would be glossed over in vanilla sex would be deal breakers in sugaring. But I could be wrong....",

I had this 1 girl on allowance for awhile and all was good until our last meet. Our last meet up was near the end of the month and she automatically got her allowance of the month on the first. Well the second of the month came and she ended it all and took the allowance knowing full well she planned on ending things. She was good up to this point. Just our last meet up it became obvious that I was just an ATM. Or at least had now evolved that way In her eyes.  We never agreed on x amount if I end it or if she ended.  I was planning on giving her 2 months worth but I never told her that.   She of course tried to get back to me when I guess she couldn't find what she was looking for but the area if one of the highly competitive areas in the country.  For the time investment she was making out great.  Of course I turned her down since I saw her true colors. She never seemed like the type to do that. \nAnother girl ppm to allowance and guess what. Once we went to allowance she got too busy. Or we just saw each other blah. I saw her 1 time that month. I then switched her to ppm for then on and that crap didn't happen again. We did that for over a year then and back to allowances and she behaved this time. \nAnother girl I saw for a few months she wanted up front and I said nope. She then said okay look you can have my car keys my wallet with the allowance and ID to put in safe until then next morning. We did this for awhile since she didn't trust me despite not ever going back on what I said. I helped her out as well in other times when I didn't see her too. So you would think she could trust me after months?  Whatever though it worked fine for us until she ended it out of nowhere without explanation just ghosted me. But ppm so she didn't owe me anything and vice versa.",

You are judging their arrangement based on your values. \n\nIf you are not interested in PPM, then why did you make the post? Because you don't like the connotation that PPM evokes?\n\nWell, there are others for whom PPM works best.\n\nI asked you before why a man would want to have a PPM arrangement. You did not answer that question. \n\nThe fact that you think losing an amount of money is ok as long as the arrangement does not seem to be an interaction with an escort shows how little you value limited resources. \n\nLet me ask you this: whatever your allowance is: your cousin (or best friend or whoever) asked you for that amount as a loan or as payment for doing some sort of work for you for the month or whatever. You give them the money upfront. They, then, do not do the work agreed upon or they take the loan and then have excuses as to why they cannot pay you back. Would you take issue with that? What would be your solution to this issue?",

I thought I had a good built in 'character' meter. I had three out of three SBs look me in the face and tell me how wonderful I was to pay them upfront and how much of this and that and appreciative they were.  Then they promptly rinsed me....\n\nOne was 2 months in. The other I had already been on allowance 3 months. The other was just two weeks into it and she rinsed me. So even over time building 'trust' did not work with these 3. \n\nHaving skills to get the upfront $$ is one thing. Having the honor to adhere to it is another.\n\nThank you for this thread and thank you for being one of the honest ones. I think after 3 years and countless disappointments I have found a great SB. I would have happily paid her upfront, but like I posted in this thread already. She prefers it weekly so she can budget better.",

She got what she came for, the easy money, then when the dates were about to become more intimate, they're gone. \n\nYou can't vet for this, and it seems like it's being promoted on tiktok and other places so I feel the need to become less helpful and more stringent on what I can do for pot SBs. It's not what I'd like to do, it's just silly to be giving away lots of time and money to SBs that are just there to take advantage of kindness. I wish it were otherwise but it's not.",

Those who think so will eventually get screwed over at some point and learn the hard way just how much some one can fake it for that initial meet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven from normal life I've met enough of perfectly professional, competent women from work seemingly sane and put together who are a fucking mess and drama-rosuer in their personal lives deep on the Hot & Crazy scale. You never know someone until you *know* someone. That simply requires time.\n\nThere are plenty of Movie/TV villains who are master manipulators/backstabbers. They are obvious to the audience because it is overacted and we get to see everything from all POV. These people unfortunately exist in real life and no one they backstab initially thought they were less than trustworthy.",

Despite some research on SLF and knowing the norms, I decided I wanted to be a great guy, didn\u2019t want to come off as a John, yada yada.   I met my first SB, gave her a unsolicited gift at the M&G, gave her a PPM for 2 platonic dates, and fortunately for me she was *not* a rinser so we started a long SR.   \n\nThen we broke up and I met another girl.  I knew it was a red flag that she asked for a partial PPM for the M&G, but she justified it since she was a waitress who\u2019d lose income, so I gave in.  The second date came, gave her a PPM and she turned down a kiss at the end.   She texted that she just doesn\u2019t like PDA but she\u2019s really into me. I made it clear I was looking to go somewhere private on the next date, and, oh my, her cell phone bill was due but we can plan an intimate date if I helped her out.   Then the time for the date comes and, omg how could luck be so bad, she has Covid and can\u2019t work could I please help her\u2026.\n\nThat is how rinsing works.  It isn\u2019t a matter of me being mad that I didn\u2019t fuck her.  If she was an honest SB with integrity and just wasn\u2019t into me and she got that money, no big deal, I can afford it.  The issue is that she used me and scammed me, and that money could\u2019ve gone to an actual SB (maybe someone like you even!).  \n\nSo, what do you think I\u2019ve done since?  No M&G fee, ever, and no PPM until she\u2019s in my house or a hotel room.  I\u2019ll never change that.   It\u2019s not because I\u2019m a John and only paying for sex and it\u2019s not because I \u201ccan\u2019t afford\u201d a couple of PPMs, it\u2019s because I was used once and I will *not* be used again.  So, if you don\u2019t like the fact that most SDs will start at PPM and PPM will start when you\u2019re in a bedroom, blame the rinsers, not the SDs.",

However, the sugar bowl has been really messed up recently because of some cultural reasons. I've been rinsed a couple of times far more often in the past two years alone then I have in the past 4-5 years before that.\n\nThere's a reason why veteran SDs are no longer willing to do allowances anymore, not without a long term established relationship. Too often these days I get ladies demanding allowances up front. I'm sorry, I've been doing too long, and have too much experience to know what's up. \n\nAnd I'm going to be brutally honest to any lady reading this. For alot of veteran SDs, the problem is not that we cannot afford it. Alot of us could probably afford to waste insane amounts of PPMs to find the right gal. The real issue is that we're wasting time, and as you get older, you'll figure out that time is far more viable then money. I could honestly care less about the money. I could probably waste like 100 ppm meets within the span of a year, the real issue is that for many of us, our time is far more valuable then whatever the PPM rate is. That's really why many SDs are no longer willing to take any kind of risk. Yes, it's callous, but it's the only way I can protect my time investment.  \n\nAnd for many of us, we're all fine with doing non-paid platonic dates.

Sugar babies of the past were either sugar GFs or Spoiled GFs, not NSA fuck buddies or personal escorts. \n\nMost sugar babies had experience SD, and received spoiling in the form of experiences, gifts and shopping. If and when a SB became exclusive or a kept woman then she also had her finances covered. \n\nThese were traditional sugar relationships, modern sugar dating took the arrangement aspect of making a friends with benefits arrangement with the payment structure of sex work. Modern sugar dating is a hybrid of traditional sugar and prostitution with many gray areas in between.\n\nI don\u2019t think any new terms need to be made\u2026 either you\u2019re looking for a modern NSA arrangement or you\u2019re looking for traditional sugar or maybe is something in between.",

My guess is in a few years SRs will all be ppm with half paid upfront and half of the agreed amount paid post date. That would make the most sense for everyone involved. As far as that being transactional - it is. Both sides have made it transactional.

They will see almost anyone and everyone that will meet their price point. Most SB are more selective. They need to find their SD somewhat attractive and have a connection while escorts don\u2019t have the same privilege. Therefore escorts will most likely have more partners and higher chances of catching an STD. But they do however require protection far more often than SB due to the high volume of partners. \n* SB on the other hand are more likely not to use protection to keep the guy around since the arrangement is usually exclusive. Maybe they want their SD to impregnate them, so they\u2019re set for life. An escort getting impregnated by a random John would be a terrible ROI. \n* Lack of performance. Because most escorts won\u2019t be attracted to their clients, it\u2019s going to be harder for them to \u201cperform\u201d or put on a \u201cgood show.\u201d And also since they\u2019re \u201chigh volume\u201d, it will be harder to give all their clients the same level of performance. SB on the other hand will be better performers due to them being attracted to their SD and low volume. \n* the average SB is more attractive than the average escort \n* Price point may differ. Some SB don\u2019t know their true worth or which bracket they belong in therefore some SD can take advantage of a bargain. There are some escorts that charge xxxx. an hour where he could find the same caliber for xxx only for a SB.\n* Clock watching or kicking you out early. Once your time slot is over which is usually half an hour or an hour, they kick you out. They usually only allow one pop and once you finish, they kick you out even if you have extra time remaining.\n* Higher rates of drug abuse or trauma because of all the men they\u2019ve encountered.",

I had this 1 girl on allowance for awhile and all was good until our last meet. Our last meet up was near the end of the month and she automatically got her allowance of the month on the first. Well the second of the month came and she ended it all and took the allowance knowing full well she planned on ending things. She was good up to this point. Just our last meet up it became obvious that I was just an ATM. Or at least had now evolved that way In her eyes.  We never agreed on x amount if I end it or if she ended.  I was planning on giving her 2 months worth but I never told her that.   She of course tried to get back to me when I guess she couldn't find what she was looking for but the area if one of the highly competitive areas in the country.  For the time investment she was making out great.  Of course I turned her down since I saw her true colors. She never seemed like the type to do that. \nAnother girl ppm to allowance and guess what. Once we went to allowance she got too busy. Or we just saw each other blah. I saw her 1 time that month. I then switched her to ppm for then on and that crap didn't happen again. We did that for over a year then and back to allowances and she behaved this time. \nAnother girl I saw for a few months she wanted up front and I said nope. She then said okay look you can have my car keys my wallet with the allowance and ID to put in safe until then next morning. We did this for awhile since she didn't trust me despite not ever going back on what I said. I helped her out as well in other times when I didn't see her too. So you would think she could trust me after months?  Whatever though it worked fine for us until she ended it out of nowhere without explanation just ghosted me. But ppm so she didn't owe me anything and vice versa.",

You are judging their arrangement based on your values. \n\nIf you are not interested in PPM, then why did you make the post? Because you don't like the connotation that PPM evokes?\n\nWell, there are others for whom PPM works best.\n\nI asked you before why a man would want to have a PPM arrangement. You did not answer that question. \n\nThe fact that you think losing an amount of money is ok as long as the arrangement does not seem to be an interaction with an escort shows how little you value limited resources. \n\nLet me ask you this: whatever your allowance is: your cousin (or best friend or whoever) asked you for that amount as a loan or as payment for doing some sort of work for you for the month or whatever. You give them the money upfront. They, then, do not do the work agreed upon or they take the loan and then have excuses as to why they cannot pay you back. Would you take issue with that? What would be your solution to this issue?",

Despite some research on SLF and knowing the norms, I decided I wanted to be a great guy, didn\u2019t want to come off as a John, yada yada.   I met my first SB, gave her a unsolicited gift at the M&G, gave her a PPM for 2 platonic dates, and fortunately for me she was *not* a rinser so we started a long SR.   \n\nThen we broke up and I met another girl.  I knew it was a red flag that she asked for a partial PPM for the M&G, but she justified it since she was a waitress who\u2019d lose income, so I gave in.  The second date came, gave her a PPM and she turned down a kiss at the end.   She texted that she just doesn\u2019t like PDA but she\u2019s really into me. I made it clear I was looking to go somewhere private on the next date, and, oh my, her cell phone bill was due but we can plan an intimate date if I helped her out.   Then the time for the date comes and, omg how could luck be so bad, she has Covid and can\u2019t work could I please help her\u2026.\n\nThat is how rinsing works.  It isn\u2019t a matter of me being mad that I didn\u2019t fuck her.  If she was an honest SB with integrity and just wasn\u2019t into me and she got that money, no big deal, I can afford it.  The issue is that she used me and scammed me, and that money could\u2019ve gone to an actual SB (maybe someone like you even!).  \n\nSo, what do you think I\u2019ve done since?  No M&G fee, ever, and no PPM until she\u2019s in my house or a hotel room.  I\u2019ll never change that.   It\u2019s not because I\u2019m a John and only paying for sex and it\u2019s not because I \u201ccan\u2019t afford\u201d a couple of PPMs, it\u2019s because I was used once and I will *not* be used again.  So, if you don\u2019t like the fact that most SDs will start at PPM and PPM will start when you\u2019re in a bedroom, blame the rinsers, not the SDs.",

Too often these days I get ladies demanding allowances up front. I'm sorry, I've been doing too long, and have too much experience to know what's up. \n\nAnd I'm going to be brutally honest to any lady reading this. For alot of veteran SDs, the problem is not that we cannot afford it. Alot of us could probably afford to waste insane amounts of PPMs to find the right gal. The real issue is that we're wasting time, and as you get older, you'll figure out that time is far more viable then money. I could honestly care less about the money. I could probably waste like 100 ppm meets within the span of a year, the real issue is that for many of us, our time is far more valuable then whatever the PPM rate is. That's really why many SDs are no longer willing to take any kind of risk. Yes, it's callous, but it's the only way I can protect my time investment.  \n\nAnd for many of us, we're all fine with doing non-paid platonic dates.

That totally discounts the guys feelings and needs and even if the money is meaningless why should you be okay with losing it? My guess is in a few years SRs will all be ppm with half paid upfront and half of the agreed amount paid post date. That would make the most sense for everyone involved. As far as that being transactional - it is. Both sides have made it transactional. I mean terms like experience daddies are thrown out as insults now a days when initially that was the main component of it all based on what I have read.",

Most SB are more selective. They need to find their SD somewhat attractive and have a connection while escorts don\u2019t have the same privilege. Therefore escorts will most likely have more partners and higher chances of catching an STD. But they do however require protection far more often than SB due to the high volume of partners. \n* SB on the other hand are more likely not to use protection to keep the guy around since the arrangement is usually exclusive. Maybe they want their SD to impregnate them, so they\u2019re set for life. An escort getting impregnated by a random John would be a terrible ROI. \n* Lack of performance. Because most escorts won\u2019t be attracted to their clients, it\u2019s going to be harder for them to \u201cperform\u201d or put on a \u201cgood show.\u201d And also since they\u2019re \u201chigh volume\u201d, it will be harder to give all their clients the same level of performance. SB on the other hand will be better performers due to them being attracted to their SD and low volume. \n* the average SB is more attractive than the average escort \n* Price point may differ. Some SB don\u2019t know their true worth or which bracket they belong in therefore some SD can take advantage of a bargain. There are some escorts that charge xxxx. an hour where he could find the same caliber for xxx only for a SB.\n* Clock watching or kicking you out early. Once your time slot is over which is usually half an hour or an hour, they kick you out. They usually only allow one pop and once you finish, they kick you out even if you have extra time remaining.\n* Higher rates of drug abuse or trauma because of all the men they\u2019ve encountered.",

I had this 1 girl on allowance for awhile and all was good until our last meet. Our last meet up was near the end of the month and she automatically got her allowance of the month on the first. Well the second of the month came and she ended it all and took the allowance knowing full well she planned on ending things. She was good up to this point. Just our last meet up it became obvious that I was just an ATM. Or at least had now evolved that way In her eyes.  We never agreed on x amount if I end it or if she ended.  I was planning on giving her 2 months worth but I never told her that.   She of course tried to get back to me when I guess she couldn't find what she was looking for but the area if one of the highly competitive areas in the country.  For the time investment she was making out great.  Of course I turned her down since I saw her true colors. She never seemed like the type to do that. \nAnother girl ppm to allowance and guess what. Once we went to allowance she got too busy. Or we just saw each other blah. I saw her 1 time that month. I then switched her to ppm for then on and that crap didn't happen again. We did that for over a year then and back to allowances and she behaved this time. \nAnother girl I saw for a few months she wanted up front and I said nope. She then said okay look you can have my car keys my wallet with the allowance and ID to put in safe until then next morning. We did this for awhile since she didn't trust me despite not ever going back on what I said. I helped her out as well in other times when I didn't see her too. So you would think she could trust me after months?  Whatever though it worked fine for us until she ended it out of nowhere without explanation just ghosted me. But ppm so she didn't owe me anything and vice versa.",

You are judging their arrangement based on your values. \n\nIf you are not interested in PPM, then why did you make the post? Because you don't like the connotation that PPM evokes?\n\nWell, there are others for whom PPM works best.\n\nI asked you before why a man would want to have a PPM arrangement. You did not answer that question. \n\nThe fact that you think losing an amount of money is ok as long as the arrangement does not seem to be an interaction with an escort shows how little you value limited resources. \n\nLet me ask you this: whatever your allowance is: your cousin (or best friend or whoever) asked you for that amount as a loan or as payment for doing some sort of work for you for the month or whatever. You give them the money upfront. They, then, do not do the work agreed upon or they take the loan and then have excuses as to why they cannot pay you back. Would you take issue with that?

Too often these days I get ladies demanding allowances up front. I'm sorry, I've been doing too long, and have too much experience to know what's up. \n\nAnd I'm going to be brutally honest to any lady reading this. For alot of veteran SDs, the problem is not that we cannot afford it. Alot of us could probably afford to waste insane amounts of PPMs to find the right gal. The real issue is that we're wasting time, and as you get older, you'll figure out that time is far more viable then money. I could honestly care less about the money. I could probably waste like 100 ppm meets within the span of a year, the real issue is that for many of us, our time is far more valuable then whatever the PPM rate is. That's really why many SDs are no longer willing to take any kind of risk. Yes, it's callous, but it's the only way I can protect my time investment.  \n\nAnd for many of us, we're all fine with doing non-paid platonic dates.

My guess is in a few years SRs will all be ppm with half paid upfront and half of the agreed amount paid post date. That would make the most sense for everyone involved. As far as that being transactional - it is. Both sides have made it transactional. I mean terms like experience daddies are thrown out as insults now a days when initially that was the main component of it all based on what I have read.",

Most SB are more selective. They need to find their SD somewhat attractive and have a connection while escorts don\u2019t have the same privilege. Therefore escorts will most likely have more partners and higher chances of catching an STD. But they do however require protection far more often than SB due to the high volume of partners. \n* SB on the other hand are more likely not to use protection to keep the guy around since the arrangement is usually exclusive. Maybe they want their SD to impregnate them, so they\u2019re set for life. An escort getting impregnated by a random John would be a terrible ROI. \n* Lack of performance. Because most escorts won\u2019t be attracted to their clients, it\u2019s going to be harder for them to \u201cperform\u201d or put on a \u201cgood show.\u201d And also since they\u2019re \u201chigh volume\u201d, it will be harder to give all their clients the same level of performance. SB on the other hand will be better performers due to them being attracted to their SD and low volume. \n* the average SB is more attractive than the average escort \n* Price point may differ. Some SB don\u2019t know their true worth or which bracket they belong in therefore some SD can take advantage of a bargain. There are some escorts that charge xxxx. an hour where he could find the same caliber for xxx only for a SB.\n* Clock watching or kicking you out early. Once your time slot is over which is usually half an hour or an hour, they kick you out. They usually only allow one pop and once you finish, they kick you out even if you have extra time remaining.\n* Higher rates of drug abuse or trauma because of all the men they\u2019ve encountered.",

            "body": "You are very rare though ..you are now like the 5 % in the bowl. This isn't the typical response. I had this 1 girl on allowance for awhile and all was good until our last meet. Our last meet up was near the end of the month and she automatically got her allowance of the month on the first. Well the second of the month came and she ended it all and took the allowance knowing full well she planned on ending things. She was good up to this point. Just our last meet up it became obvious that I was just an ATM. Or at least had now evolved that way In her eyes.  We never agreed on x amount if I end it or if she ended.  I was planning on giving her 2 months worth but I never told her that.   She of course tried to get back to me when I guess she couldn't find what she was looking for but the area if one of the highly competitive areas in the country.  For the time investment she was making out great.  Of course I turned her down since I saw her true colors. She never seemed like the type to do that. \nAnother girl ppm to allowance and guess what. Once we went to allowance she got too busy. Or we just saw each other blah. I saw her 1 time that month. I then switched her to ppm for then on and that crap didn't happen again. We did that for over a year then and back to allowances and she behaved this time. \nAnother girl I saw for a few months she wanted up front and I said nope. She then said okay look you can have my car keys my wallet with the allowance and ID to put in safe until then next morning. We did this for awhile since she didn't trust me despite not ever going back on what I said. I helped her out as well in other times when I didn't see her too. So you would think she could trust me after months?  Whatever though it worked fine for us until she ended it out of nowhere without explanation just ghosted me. But ppm so she didn't owe me anything and vice versa.",

You are judging their arrangement based on your values. \n\nIf you are not interested in PPM, then why did you make the post? Because you don't like the connotation that PPM evokes?\n\nWell, there are others for whom PPM works best.\n\nI asked you before why a man would want to have a PPM arrangement. You did not answer that question. \n\nThe fact that you think losing an amount of money is ok as long as the arrangement does not seem to be an interaction with an escort shows how little you value limited resources. \n\nLet me ask you this: whatever your allowance is: your cousin (or best friend or whoever) asked you for that amount as a loan or as payment for doing some sort of work for you for the month or whatever. You give them the money upfront. They, then, do not do the work agreed upon or they take the loan and then have excuses as to why they cannot pay you back. Would you take issue with that? What would be your solution to this issue?",

My guess is in a few years SRs will all be ppm with half paid upfront and half of the agreed amount paid post date. That would make the most sense for everyone involved. As far as that being transactional - it is. Both sides have made it transactional.
