Yeah women have lots of eggs, but they don't get any more after they run out and not all of them are going to be viable, dudes can produce sperm well into old age. Just look at the price difference. If you sell your sperm you can expect $70/nut busted, women can get 10 grand for a batch of 10 to 20 eggs. \n\nMy first point would be that this is obviously a joke, you joyless twat, but what anatomy did I fuck up, exactly?",

Everything else with summoning the statue and using Hashi's cells came from himself as Madara didn't know of Zetsu's existence until he thought to have created him (while demonstrating some yin yang release stuff to Obito) which btw shows again that the Zetsu twist makes no sense unless Madara was demented or something like that because he was already around 100 years old I think by the time he manipulated Obito. Long story short, Zetsu wasn't the brains behind all of it, he manipulated Madara by changing the stone tablet basically that's all. Everything Madara knew came from that stone tablet as far as the canon story goes. And by the way, deciphering the stone tablet is a feat on its own since Fugaku with his Mangekyo and his gang had been trying to do the same with no to only little success (could've been filler material though not sure). Anyway as far as manipulating 'kids' goes (he basically manipulated a village into kidnapping Rin and orchestrated the whole 3 tails inside of Rin stuff but okay let's just call them kids), while morally questionable, he knew exactly what kid to choose to manipulate and he managed to get revived by the same kid so yea...and Obito being manipulated by seeing Rin die was exactly according to his plans if I'm not wrong (might want to rewatch the scene where Madara reveals that he's manipulated Obito for yourself I'm not quite sure on that one anymore). Anyhow I'm done arguing with you we've been having this shitty discussion yesterday and I feel like arguing with a freaking wall. Can't take any of your arguments seriously and frankly I'm starting to think you're a troll lol",

Everything else with summoning the statue and using Hashi's cells came from himself as Madara didn't know of Zetsu's existence until he thought to have created him (while demonstrating some yin yang release stuff to Obito) which btw shows again that the Zetsu twist makes no sense unless Madara was demented or something like that because he was already around 100 years old I think by the time he manipulated Obito. Long story short, Zetsu wasn't the brains behind all of it, he manipulated Madara by changing the stone tablet basically that's all. Everything Madara knew came from that stone tablet as far as the canon story goes. And by the way, deciphering the stone tablet is a feat on its own since Fugaku with his Mangekyo and his gang had been trying to do the same with no to only little success (could've been filler material though not sure). Anyway as far as manipulating 'kids' goes (he basically manipulated a village into kidnapping Rin and orchestrated the whole 3 tails inside of Rin stuff but okay let's just call them kids), while morally questionable, he knew exactly what kid to choose to manipulate and he managed to get revived by the same kid so yea...and Obito being manipulated by seeing Rin die was exactly according to his plans if I'm not wrong (might want to rewatch the scene where Madara reveals that he's manipulated Obito for yourself I'm not quite sure on that one anymore). Anyhow I'm done arguing with you we've been having this shitty discussion yesterday and I feel like arguing with a freaking wall. Can't take any of your arguments seriously and frankly I'm starting to think you're a troll lol",

Maybe you cant knock up every kunoichi in the world but one guy could impregnate most of konoha. Yeah women have lots of eggs, but they don't get any more after they run out and not all of them are going to be viable, dudes can produce sperm well into old age. Just look at the price difference. If you sell your sperm you can expect $70/nut busted, women can get 10 grand for a batch of 10 to 20 eggs. \n\nMy first point would be that this is obviously a joke, you joyless twat, but what anatomy did I fuck up, exactly?",

Everything else with summoning the statue and using Hashi's cells came from himself as Madara didn't know of Zetsu's existence until he thought to have created him (while demonstrating some yin yang release stuff to Obito) which btw shows again that the Zetsu twist makes no sense unless Madara was demented or something like that because he was already around 100 years old I think by the time he manipulated Obito. Long story short, Zetsu wasn't the brains behind all of it, he manipulated Madara by changing the stone tablet basically that's all. Everything Madara knew came from that stone tablet as far as the canon story goes. And by the way, deciphering the stone tablet is a feat on its own since Fugaku with his Mangekyo and his gang had been trying to do the same with no to only little success (could've been filler material though not sure). Anyway as far as manipulating 'kids' goes (he basically manipulated a village into kidnapping Rin and orchestrated the whole 3 tails inside of Rin stuff but okay let's just call them kids), while morally questionable, he knew exactly what kid to choose to manipulate and he managed to get revived by the same kid so yea...and Obito being manipulated by seeing Rin die was exactly according to his plans if I'm not wrong (might want to rewatch the scene where Madara reveals that he's manipulated Obito for yourself I'm not quite sure on that one anymore). Anyhow I'm done arguing with you we've been having this shitty discussion yesterday and I feel like arguing with a freaking wall. Can't take any of your arguments seriously and frankly I'm starting to think you're a troll lol",

If you sell your sperm you can expect $70/nut busted, women can get 10 grand for a batch of 10 to 20 eggs. \n\nMy first point would be that this is obviously a joke, you joyless twat, but what anatomy did I fuck up, exactly?",

Everything else with summoning the statue and using Hashi's cells came from himself as Madara didn't know of Zetsu's existence until he thought to have created him (while demonstrating some yin yang release stuff to Obito) which btw shows again that the Zetsu twist makes no sense unless Madara was demented or something like that because he was already around 100 years old I think by the time he manipulated Obito. Long story short, Zetsu wasn't the brains behind all of it, he manipulated Madara by changing the stone tablet basically that's all. Everything Madara knew came from that stone tablet as far as the canon story goes. And by the way, deciphering the stone tablet is a feat on its own since Fugaku with his Mangekyo and his gang had been trying to do the same with no to only little success (could've been filler material though not sure). Anyway as far as manipulating 'kids' goes (he basically manipulated a village into kidnapping Rin and orchestrated the whole 3 tails inside of Rin stuff but okay let's just call them kids), while morally questionable, he knew exactly what kid to choose to manipulate and he managed to get revived by the same kid so yea...and Obito being manipulated by seeing Rin die was exactly according to his plans if I'm not wrong (might want to rewatch the scene where Madara reveals that he's manipulated Obito for yourself I'm not quite sure on that one anymore). Anyhow I'm done arguing with you we've been having this shitty discussion yesterday and I feel like arguing with a freaking wall. Can't take any of your arguments seriously and frankly I'm starting to think you're a troll lol",

Maybe you cant knock up every kunoichi in the world but one guy could impregnate most of konoha. Yeah women have lots of eggs, but they don't get any more after they run out and not all of them are going to be viable, dudes can produce sperm well into old age. Just look at the price difference. If you sell your sperm you can expect $70/nut busted, women can get 10 grand for a batch of 10 to 20 eggs. \n\nMy first point would be that this is obviously a joke, you joyless twat, but what anatomy did I fuck up, exactly?",

Everything else with summoning the statue and using Hashi's cells came from himself as Madara didn't know of Zetsu's existence until he thought to have created him (while demonstrating some yin yang release stuff to Obito) which btw shows again that the Zetsu twist makes no sense unless Madara was demented or something like that because he was already around 100 years old I think by the time he manipulated Obito. Long story short, Zetsu wasn't the brains behind all of it, he manipulated Madara by changing the stone tablet basically that's all. Everything Madara knew came from that stone tablet as far as the canon story goes. And by the way, deciphering the stone tablet is a feat on its own since Fugaku with his Mangekyo and his gang had been trying to do the same with no to only little success (could've been filler material though not sure). Anyway as far as manipulating 'kids' goes (he basically manipulated a village into kidnapping Rin and orchestrated the whole 3 tails inside of Rin stuff but okay let's just call them kids), while morally questionable, he knew exactly what kid to choose to manipulate and he managed to get revived by the same kid so yea...and Obito being manipulated by seeing Rin die was exactly according to his plans if I'm not wrong (might want to rewatch the scene where Madara reveals that he's manipulated Obito for yourself I'm not quite sure on that one anymore). Anyhow I'm done arguing with you we've been having this shitty discussion yesterday and I feel like arguing with a freaking wall. Can't take any of your arguments seriously and frankly I'm starting to think you're a troll lol",

Everything else with summoning the statue and using Hashi's cells came from himself as Madara didn't know of Zetsu's existence until he thought to have created him (while demonstrating some yin yang release stuff to Obito) which btw shows again that the Zetsu twist makes no sense unless Madara was demented or something like that because he was already around 100 years old I think by the time he manipulated Obito. Long story short, Zetsu wasn't the brains behind all of it, he manipulated Madara by changing the stone tablet basically that's all. Everything Madara knew came from that stone tablet as far as the canon story goes. And by the way, deciphering the stone tablet is a feat on its own since Fugaku with his Mangekyo and his gang had been trying to do the same with no to only little success (could've been filler material though not sure). Anyway as far as manipulating 'kids' goes (he basically manipulated a village into kidnapping Rin and orchestrated the whole 3 tails inside of Rin stuff but okay let's just call them kids), while morally questionable, he knew exactly what kid to choose to manipulate and he managed to get revived by the same kid so yea...and Obito being manipulated by seeing Rin die was exactly according to his plans if I'm not wrong (might want to rewatch the scene where Madara reveals that he's manipulated Obito for yourself I'm not quite sure on that one anymore). Anyhow I'm done arguing with you we've been having this shitty discussion yesterday and I feel like arguing with a freaking wall. Can't take any of your arguments seriously and frankly I'm starting to think you're a troll lol",

Everything else with summoning the statue and using Hashi's cells came from himself as Madara didn't know of Zetsu's existence until he thought to have created him (while demonstrating some yin yang release stuff to Obito) which btw shows again that the Zetsu twist makes no sense unless Madara was demented or something like that because he was already around 100 years old I think by the time he manipulated Obito. Long story short, Zetsu wasn't the brains behind all of it, he manipulated Madara by changing the stone tablet basically that's all. Everything Madara knew came from that stone tablet as far as the canon story goes. And by the way, deciphering the stone tablet is a feat on its own since Fugaku with his Mangekyo and his gang had been trying to do the same with no to only little success (could've been filler material though not sure). Anyway as far as manipulating 'kids' goes (he basically manipulated a village into kidnapping Rin and orchestrated the whole 3 tails inside of Rin stuff but okay let's just call them kids), while morally questionable, he knew exactly what kid to choose to manipulate and he managed to get revived by the same kid so yea...and Obito being manipulated by seeing Rin die was exactly according to his plans if I'm not wrong (might want to rewatch the scene where Madara reveals that he's manipulated Obito for yourself I'm not quite sure on that one anymore). Anyhow I'm done arguing with you we've been having this shitty discussion yesterday and I feel like arguing with a freaking wall. Can't take any of your arguments seriously and frankly I'm starting to think you're a troll lol",

Everything else with summoning the statue and using Hashi's cells came from himself as Madara didn't know of Zetsu's existence until he thought to have created him (while demonstrating some yin yang release stuff to Obito) which btw shows again that the Zetsu twist makes no sense unless Madara was demented or something like that because he was already around 100 years old I think by the time he manipulated Obito. Long story short, Zetsu wasn't the brains behind all of it, he manipulated Madara by changing the stone tablet basically that's all. Everything Madara knew came from that stone tablet as far as the canon story goes. And by the way, deciphering the stone tablet is a feat on its own since Fugaku with his Mangekyo and his gang had been trying to do the same with no to only little success (could've been filler material though not sure). Anyway as far as manipulating 'kids' goes (he basically manipulated a village into kidnapping Rin and orchestrated the whole 3 tails inside of Rin stuff but okay let's just call them kids), while morally questionable, he knew exactly what kid to choose to manipulate and he managed to get revived by the same kid so yea...and Obito being manipulated by seeing Rin die was exactly according to his plans if I'm not wrong (might want to rewatch the scene where Madara reveals that he's manipulated Obito for yourself I'm not quite sure on that one anymore). Anyhow I'm done arguing with you we've been having this shitty discussion yesterday and I feel like arguing with a freaking wall. Can't take any of your arguments seriously and frankly I'm starting to think you're a troll lol",
