    "body": "I\u2019m in a sugar fb group cause I\u2019m bored and it\u2019s basically 1000 girls asking each other for tips and if they can help each other find a man. \n\n\u201cLooking for an SD to talk, text and send pics to.\u201d I don\u2019t know why this bothers me so but I wrote under her comment \u201cthat\u2019s not sugaring.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m gate keeping sugaring lol. But I get peeved... it takes a certain type of man and woman to play in the sugar world. There\u2019s a lot of nuance. For me it\u2019s a very special relationship so I get annoyed when girls think they can get $x/week for a 30 min phone call and some feet pics. \n\nI guess it taints the pool for everyone else. And I don\u2019t want these SDs messaging me and thinking they can get away with a measly allowance since they\u2019ve been dealing with these high school graduates who want their phone bill paid.",

Heck, I've spent money (I would never have been considered an SD, because it was random) on phone sex, caming, and buying pictures.  (of girls I was having phone sex with).  BUUUUUT.  I'd spent ten dollars on 15 pictures.  Lol.  \n\nThere are \"whales\" however, that will tip hundreds, even thousands (in some cases) of dollars to these women.\n\nAnd they are (in the phone/cam sex world) often called sugar daddies :(.",

The married guy that wants 150/ 200 for a full long date with a happy ending and no condom I've had a vasectomy 2x a week \ud83d\ude02 \n\nOr, I want a travel companion. No other payment besides me paying for the trip.  Isn't my company enough for you to endure  having to pay attention to me 24/7 for days? I always hated that offer.\n\nI havent really used SA in years. I was into 5 years ago but didnt know how to do it yet. Most of the guys I met were just toying around with it, thought it was more of a hook up site. I was a newbie but still knew what number I was comfortable with, and I feel a few tried to exploit the newbieness for sure. Now I know what to look for and what I want. Last one I met was a married guy that was so cool but wanted a gf and not to pay so it wouldn't feel transactional  (fucking hate. That. Excuse). Found a great one in real  life! Especially now, SA has to be a shit show.",

What has surprised me the most is how many of them love stinky/smelly feet!!\n\nI keep my foot fetish model stuff completely separate from my SR profile, and I don\u2019t generally bring it up in sugaring subs.
