    "body": "Several months ago I had to give up an SB because of financial and travel considerations. She lives several hours away and I would only visit her about once a month, sometimes less often, on a PPM basis. After no communication for a couple of months, I reached out to say hello and to see how she was doing. She replied that she was well and getting by.\n\nOn a whim, I sent her about 1/4 of our PPM, and later this text: \"Check Venmo. A little something for you. Not much, but I am thinking of you and want you to know that.\" A few hours later she replied: \"Aw thank you so much. You didn't have to do that. I hope you know how grateful I am. I wish someday we can meet again.\"\n\nMade me feel so good. Being a daddy is not all about the sugar.",

The only SBs I date are ones whose lives I take an interest in and who I think can really use the $ to better their position/future. Thus, giving their allowance gives me that same warm fuzzy feeling I get when I write a check to a worthy cause.",
