He never used wood style after the blood mist slaughter aside from once when hooked to the ten tails iirc  because it uses too much and never used the rinnegans heftier costing abilities, or even many ninjutsu for that matter. He only really used kamui and even then it\u2019s pretty likely that hashiramas cells kinda nullified the effects on chakra and blindness.\n\nPlus it kinda fits his character being the former uchiha dunce. He\u2019s had basically nothing natural unlike most characters so he\u2019s had to work around it to stand a chance, so it makes sense for him to have been born with pretty low chakra reserves",

He never used wood style after the blood mist slaughter aside from once when hooked to the ten tails iirc  because it uses too much and never used the rinnegans heftier costing abilities, or even many ninjutsu for that matter. He only really used kamui and even then it\u2019s pretty likely that hashiramas cells kinda nullified the effects on chakra and blindness.\n\nPlus it kinda fits his character being the former uchiha dunce. He\u2019s had basically nothing natural unlike most characters so he\u2019s had to work around it to stand a chance, so it makes sense for him to have been born with pretty low chakra reserves",
