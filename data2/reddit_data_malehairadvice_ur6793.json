The potential employer knows from market research that a significant percent of his customers judge the firm partly by the haircuts worn by male employees and so he offers positions to male applicants who are not going to have  a negative impact on the firm's  business simply due to negative first impressions stemming from his male employees' hairstyles. \n\nFor instance, say the employer is an investment management firm that deals with an older clientele who is most interested in  preserving capital which is usually accomplished by a more conservative investing philosophy. If a client/potential client then sees male advisors, analysts etc at the firm wearing other than traditional conservative dress and haircuts, and with dangling ear rings, he may wonder what is going on at the firm and have second thoughts about giving his portfolio to the firm to manage.",

The potential employer knows from market research that a significant percent of his customers judge the firm partly by the haircuts worn by male employees and so he offers positions to male applicants who are not going to have  a negative impact on the firm's  business simply due to negative first impressions stemming from his male employees' hairstyles. \n\nFor instance, say the employer is an investment management firm that deals with an older clientele who is most interested in  preserving capital which is usually accomplished by a more conservative investing philosophy. If a client/potential client then sees male advisors, analysts etc at the firm wearing other than traditional conservative dress and haircuts, and with dangling ear rings, he may wonder what is going on at the firm and have second thoughts about giving his portfolio to the firm to manage.",
