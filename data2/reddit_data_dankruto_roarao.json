Pain used the toads to his advantage the same way Delta used Naruto's kids to her advantage. He literally tosses Pa toad into Naruto's arms to keep him from countering as he almighty pulls him into a choke slam. If he hadn't endangered them, Naruto would've simply went Sage Mode again using the last clone he had left and bodied him, that's painfully evident, especially since that's what he ends up doing anyway after his 9-tails rampage.\"*\n\n*\"I find it pretty weird people always seem to conveniently forget certain details in order to discredit Naruto.\"*\n\nThere seriously is this really, really weird thing people like to do where they like to treat Naruto and Kurama as if they're separate powers. They're not. Jinchuriki aren't separate from their tailed beast, and that's just the simple reality of the situation. If they are, then tell Sasuke to put his eyes back in Itachi's sockets in the grave. Tell Madara to return every amp he ever took or stole back where he got it from. Tell Killer Bee he isn't even worth a pile of shit without his 8 tails always \"helping\" him like it did against Taka Sasuke and Kisame, and Gaara and the other Jinchuriki as well. Tell Obito it was really the ten tails doing all the work in his unstable condition and he had absolutely no part in it. \n\nYou see how far that gets you? About as far as I can throw you.\n\nAnother thing, which is really just icing on the cake honestly, Pain knew *exactly* what he was getting himself into fighting a Jinchuriki. Just like when he fought the other Jinchuriki. Naruto just happened to be the only Jinchuriki who didn't need to use his tailed beast to whoop his ass. Pain knew the risks, he just lost. It's quite literally that simple.\n\nEven Minato \"helped\" Naruto here more than the 9-tails did. I don't know who never told any of you this, but Kurama was never helping Naruto. He took over and intended to just kill everyone and everything. When he broke out of the chibaku tensei, *Kurama* was the one who broke out of it. It was literally Minato that fixed Naruto's seal and have him return normal again. \n\nKurama did nothing to Pain that made him any weaker after their brief scuffle. Only person truly affected by it was Nagato. Pain was perfectly fine, and was in the same condition after the fight with 6-tails Naruto that he was in before it. Pain simply was a dead person being used as a vessel to fight. He doesn't have stamina. He doesn't feel pain. He doesn't have chakra reserves. He can spam as many rinnegan abilities as he'd like and there wouldn't be any consequences of it except a weak ass cooldown timer. But let's just ignore that, right?\n\nIt's hilarious how much random shit people chalk up to Kurama honestly.",

It was just a 1v1 with sage mode Naruto.\n\nWhat good is the 9 tails breaking out of the chibaku tensei if Naruto ceases to exist? Then Pain loses. Nagato loses. Naruto loses. The leaf village loses. Everyone loses.\n\nEdit: If people truly felt as though the 9 tails hindered Pain in any way whatsoever just by fighting him, then why does nobody bring up how Pain literally fought the entire leaf village before Naruto ever even showed up?

He had expended a lot, but it had no noticeable affects on his ability to control Pain. His movements and reactions were still the same speed. He was still able to use almighty push and universal pull to the same extent, there wasn't even an extended cooldown where he couldn't use his powers anymore, like there was when he destroyed the village. The Diva Path of Pain was essentially completely unaffected from that fight. It's a corpse being manipulated and as long as Nagato still has the chakra to control it (which he did, he had plenty) it won't go down or get weaker.\n\nAs for the Minato thing, the guy isn't saying that Minato directly helped Naruto defeat Pain in the same physical way Kurama did. He's saying Kurama wasn't helping Naruto, at least not intentionally. Kurama was just destroying everything for the sake of destroying everything. Pain happened to be the closest thing around, so Kurama did its best to kill him. After the 7 tail or so, Naruto was no longer even remotely in control. Minato helped him by rebuilding the seal, and giving Naruto another chance to take down Pain without succumbing to the 9 tails, which would've effectively killed him.",

But my god, every time you say something I can feel my brain cells shrieking in agony before committing mass suicide. You are right about one thing though, it's true that Naruto couldn't have won if Kurama hadn't broken out of the chibaku tensei. However, no one was saying otherwise or at least I wasn't. What *I* was saying is that Pain was effectively uninhibited by the fight with Kurama. Now the keyword there is \"effectively,\" if you can understand the meaning of the word in this context. Narratively speaking yes, Nagato was affected greatly by the immense amount of chakra he had to use to fight Kurama. However immediately after the fact, when Naruto is in control again, he goes right back to spamming Almighty Push and Universal Pull to the exact same effect. His movement and reaction speed hasn't decreased at all, he didn't have a longer cooldown on Almighty Push, Almighty Push isn't noticeably weaker, and the corpse that Pain was made of hadn't suffered any grievous wounds.

If someone's gotta resort to dirty tactics to gain the upper hand on their opponent that alone should tell you how the fight would go between them, pretty much exactly like how it ended up going anyway. Delta only resorted to using Naruto's kids as bait because she felt she wasn't getting anywhere currently and that's pretty much the same exact situation Pain was in against Sage Mode Naruto.",

This is easily the most cringe argument I've ever had in my life. But hey, good job moving the goalposts in a desperate but futile attempt to salvage some shred of dignity as you fall deeper into the pit of ignorance and insignificance. Your foolish tenacity has been acknowledged. But this is a battle that you shall lose all the same, because if the argument is that Naruto couldn't have won without Kurama, then the solution for me is even simpler than before. Naruto not only could've won without Kurama, but absolutely would have if it weren't for Ma and Pa. Their presence was a hindrance more than it was a help. Pa attempted to use the same genjutsu on Pain that they'd used with Jiraiya when they first fought Pain, which immediately prompted him to kill Pa. Naruto's attempt to save them is what got him caught and things went downhill from there. If they simply hadn't been present, or otherwise hadn't been attacked, Naruto would've won by himself in the exact same way he ultimately did anyways. The only difference is that it would've been without Kurama's intervention.",

I'm the troll? Interesting. I do believe I made it quite clear that I don't care about the discussion earlier. I hardly considered it an argument, let alone a matter of winning or losing. It's an anime and I don't put genuine effort or emotional investment into discussions about fictional characters or settings. However, I did raise actual points. I made sound arguments backed by evidence. You on the other hand quite literally just kept repeating yourself again and again,. \"Lma0\" this, \"actually\" that, and you never once explained your reasoning or gave any sort of evidence as to your point. Clearly you care about winning far more than I do, since you're still prattling on about it, whereas I had already moved on and attempted to end the discussion quite concisely. So unless the meaning of the word has changed in the last hour or so, I don't believe I'm the troll here. But once again, I extend to you permission to believe whatever you so desire. I don't care. And feel free to continue proving my point; you are a slave to your most toxic habits. You're still here because you're unable to stop. You simply must have the last word. You can't help it.

The bottom line. They were gonna go clean through him like they did Momoshiki when they were older lmao. He couldn't land anything on them, he couldn't do anything. All he did was level up and block shit. Somehow that translated into \"lOl hEs rEaLlY oP nOw\" to these Madara fanboys even though he didn't even do anything.\n\nEdit: About Limbo, people overexaggerate how OP it is. It's definitely OP against people who either can't see it or sense it, but Naruto and Sasuke could both sense or see them. In the anime, Naruto decides to make 1 shadow clone per limbo clone when he could've just dumped 20 on them to overwhelm them and keep them busy as he and Sasuke went after the real Madara.\n\nThe Limbo clones are literally no different than regular clones when everyone in the battle can also see them. Only difference is they don't poof after taking too much damage. We actually don't even know what happens to them if they take too much damage.",

And Rinne Sharingan is stronger than Rinnegan, so he should scale above Naruto and Sasuke at this point. Not to mention fact that he is more versitile.\n\nI understand the thought process, but no. He never once proved to be above them. All of his buffs absolutely pale in compairson to Kaguya and her power, and again, we saw how well Naruto was handling himself against her. He was doing *more* than just \"handling\" himself. He was actually soloing her by himself. \n\nThe point is Juubidara pales in comparison to her, and even Kaguya herself wasn't enough to completely overwhelm them. Naruto and Sasuke with their six paths powers during the war were far more powerful than anyone gave them credit for. And Madara wasn't more versatile than they were. It's funny, because as much as people were saying Juubidara was holding back/hiding power, so were Naruto and Sasuke. Naruto only made 4 clones to fight the Limbo clones instead of making like 10 or 500, and he never used boil release on him yet. And just like how his Limbo clones could use Susanoo, Naruto's shadow clones can all manifest the Kurama avatar. He could also literally use 3 headed Kurama at any given moment as well. Could also probably give Sasuke some bijuu chakra to amp his Susanoo like Sasuke did in their fight against each other.\n\n>You never showed scan of them being able to even touch him after getting Six Paths Power.\n\nThat's never been the discussion. We're talking about the misconception Madara was \"above\" them, despite his feats heavily suggesting otherwise.",

When he matched her power on *numerous* occasions. How he was controlling the battle against her with his shadow clones. \n\nIt doesn't matter if she was serious or not, not when even when she did decide to get serious and try to kill Naruto and Sasuke, she was still utterly incapable of doing it.\n\n>But she wasn't serious, and wanted his Chakra. Few moments later she litteraly slaps him.\n\n\nLmao, \"slaps\". All you seem to be able to do is turn an ant-hill into a mountain. She pushed him back and poofed clones. She never once landed any real attacks on him, nor was she able to damage either of these kids to any significant degree the *entire* battle. In fact, she performed so poorly against these kids they both evidently had the energy to immediately fight each other for almost an entire 24 hours because Kaguya clearly couldn't even tire them out the entire time she fought them.\n\n\n\n>He is one pearson and he has both of Naruto's and Sasuke's Main powers(Tailed beast/Sage Mode and EMS/Rinnegan). In both cases better than theirs.\n\nCompletely irrelevant, and absolutely *nothing* proves or suggests he was better than them with their own powers. What he was to them was *stronger* than them individually. That's it.\n\n>Clones might be a problem, tho Madara knows Shinra Tensei and other large scale attacks. He also should have Xhakra at least comparable to Naruto, and spam wood clones.\n\nNothing in his arsenal will be enough to stop his clones. Not when Naruto can simply make more.\n\n>Would need to gather nature energy first, it would take some time.\n\nWhich would be easy. Madara's too focused on everything and everyone else in the battle to care about what that 1 clone is doing. He wouldn't even notice a clone leaving, let alone stopping it from doing what it's gonna do. He'd need to get past Naruto first for that.\n\n\n>Sasuke isn't really a problem here. He doesn't scale to Naruto, so he doesn't have any feats to put him on level of upper Six Paths characters.\n\nHe's literally directly comparable to Naruto. It's hard to take you seriously when you repeatedly say shit like this bro. No he isn't stronger than Naruto, but he's still in the same tier as him and directly comparable *to* him.\n\n>It's also worth noting, that all Madara needs to do is killing Sasuke. After that, he can use Mugen Tsukiyome and it's GG.\n\nHe's not gonna kill Sasuke. Sasuke's hax makes up for what power he lacks, that's always been common knowledge.",

Madara was just gonna get curbstomped. His arrogance deluded him into believing that not only he was stronger than teen Naruto *and* Sasuke's combined power, but that he was also stronger than Hagoromo. All his powerups did was put him *on their level,* never did he surpass them both.",

Akira even drew a doodle of SS4 for the og showcreators, which supposedly was gonna be used for inspiration for SSGod, but we got Goku with red highlights instead in the finalised BotGs movie.\n\nPersonally it would've been better to give Boruto Next Gen the GT approach completely to give the main manga writer more creativity in terms of storytelling, so then if it failed Kishi could've just started over like Super did, but I digress.",

If Amado can make cyborgs that easily rival Gigen who destroyed pre-nerf Naruto and Sasuke, then I see no reason why orochimaru who has way more knowledge in chakra and Ninjutsu and created someone like Mitsuki with sage mode imbedded since birth, cannot do something similar, let alone something basic like genjutsu immunity that all Kara members have btw. We have no idea what he did in the many years between shippuden.",

Code doesn\u2019t have any Rinnegan, so are you arguing in good faith that Sasuke can just get in there and put him in a genjutsu and be over with? And once again, you need to understand that Orochimaru wasn\u2019t just sitting around during the time skip.

So in terms of results, a lot of people have been spared, Kakashi didn't die, there's enough time to evacuate the village so even if Tendo Pain goes high up and nukes the village, there would be nearly no casualties. In reality, there were a lot of dead and casualties, Tsunade tried to cover her mistake by healing the injured but if it wasn't for Naruto of for talk no jutsu, the results would be catastrophic. \n\nNow regarding Tendo Pain, like I said Jiraiya had plenty of assets, just to name a few:\n\n- He summons his toad cage to imprison the path, shinra tensei may have an effect but still hindered\n\n- He attaches himself to Pain with his hair technique to keep the same distance despite shinra tensei, not to forget the toad grandparents also attached to Jiraiya\n\n- He has very long distance attacks such has fire jutsu empowered by toad oil, the reason Naruto struggled so much was because he only had rasengan as attack and his only long distance one was rasenshuriken which he couldn't control its trajectory. The only solution Naruto had was spam clones and force Pain to spam shinra tensei then make profit of the cooldown, Jiraiya can counter it way more easily with long distance attacks\n\nTell me how this is wrong",

Tsunade debated the 4th raikage and convinced him to have Killer B to train Naruto to become a perfect jinchuriki .Without Tsunade Naruto would've not got the KCM 1 and 2 .\n\n2. Shikamaru, Gaara, Kakashi, Sakura, Iruka and Jiraya, basically all of Naruto's \" friends \" tried to stop Naruto to go after Sasuke .Jiraya even called Naruto stupid for doing it .Meanwhile Tsunade was the only person who had faith in Naruto and supported in him to save Sasuke .\nAnd as Sasuke said when they finished their battle and had their arms ripped in blood, the only reason why he accepted Naruto's friendship is because of Naruto's attempts to save him, \" attempts \" that would've not happend if Tsunade would've not SUPPORTED HIM or if Jiraya/Tobirama would've been hokages in her place .\nSo the reason why Sasuke is good and back again, is because of Tsunade's faith in Naruto .\n\n3. Tsunade saved Jiraya's overrated ass at the 3rd way deadlock from Orochimaru when they were young. \nSo Naruto only had Jiraya as sensei because of Tsunade .\n\n4. Tsunade saved Naruto's family Kakashi and Sasuke from Itachi's dumbass to putt this 2 in Tsukuyomi ( Naruto called team 7 his family ) .\n\n5. Tsunade saved the imbecile stupid ass of Naruto's future wife Hinata, who saved Naruto from Pain .\nNo Tsunade, No Hinata, No Hinata no Minato, No Minato no Naruto saving the village .\n\n6. Tsunade teached the medical jutsu to Sakura who saved Hinata's garbage bitchass twice and who saved Naruto's life when she litteraly holded Naruto's fucking heart in her palm .\n\n7. Tsunade saved Naruto's friend Rock Lee from being habdicapped .\n\n8. Tsunade saved Naruto's friend Gaara from Madara, when she also saved the other kages with her last breath .\n\n9. According to Jiraya Tsunade is the biggest reason of winning the second shinobi world war, and unlike Naruto who got his ass carried by Kurama and who got roided with S06P bullshit powers over the night for which he didn't trained 1 second, Tsunade STOMPED the war only with HER OWN SKILL .\n\n10 .Tsunade didn't killed Jiraya's dumass, Tsunade tried to convince him to not go, than she offered herself to help Jiraya by going with him, but his cornflake stupid ass declined both of her offers, so he deserved to die .\n\n11. Of all the 5 kages, despite being a support type shinobi, Tsunade had the most attack shots at Madara, she's the only one who physically touched him, and she did this while carrying the other kages with healing and chakra reserves .Meanwhile Onoki was carried by Tsunade's heal/chakra and by raikage's speed .Tsunade was the mvp, despite Madara destroying them .\n\nTsunade isn't overrated, Tsunade is hella UNDERRATED .She did more than Naruto as hokage, she did much more for Naruto than Jiraya did for him, and she did much more for Naruto, than Naruto has done for her .\n\nYou're just another mentally retarded butthurted Naruto cornfalke simp who has no ideea of how the things happened in the series.\nThis post is garbage, just like the video from YouTube from which you stoled this thumbnail . \n\nGo ahead, report me for exposing your stupidity .",

Jiraiya knew that, and beyond that he prefers doing missions alone.\n\nLiterally no one knew Pain existed at that point, so while the mission was known to be dangerous it wasn't known just how much. And she did her job as Hokage, in fact she's gone above and beyond. She pulled a Gaara by practically dying to protect the villagers from Pain, and thanks to her and Katsuyu many people were only injured instead of killed. She vouched for Naruto in letting him enter the war, which is quite literally the only reason the war was won. They needed Naruto and she placed her trust in him. She's the one who personally made the decision to go to the front lines and face Madara, and the other kage fell in line behind her (with the exceptions of Gaara and Ohnoki who were already at the front lines). And she fought Madara ferociously, and is the only reason the other 4 kage survived despite she herself being quite literally torn in half. And on top of all that, just like Sakura she is personally responsible for saving dozens if not hundreds of lives during the war, though her relevance to that end was taken over by Sakura directly when Katsuyu went to her and when Sakura manifested the mitotic regeneration seal.",

Pain used the toads to his advantage the same way Delta used Naruto's kids to her advantage. He literally tosses Pa toad into Naruto's arms to keep him from countering as he almighty pulls him into a choke slam. If he hadn't endangered them, Naruto would've simply went Sage Mode again using the last clone he had left and bodied him, that's painfully evident, especially since that's what he ends up doing anyway after his 9-tails rampage.\"*\n\n*\"I find it pretty weird people always seem to conveniently forget certain details in order to discredit Naruto.\"*\n\nThere seriously is this really, really weird thing people like to do where they like to treat Naruto and Kurama as if they're separate powers. They're not. Jinchuriki aren't separate from their tailed beast, and that's just the simple reality of the situation. If they are, then tell Sasuke to put his eyes back in Itachi's sockets in the grave. Tell Madara to return every amp he ever took or stole back where he got it from. Tell Killer Bee he isn't even worth a pile of shit without his 8 tails always \"helping\" him like it did against Taka Sasuke and Kisame, and Gaara and the other Jinchuriki as well. Tell Obito it was really the ten tails doing all the work in his unstable condition and he had absolutely no part in it. \n\nYou see how far that gets you? About as far as I can throw you.\n\nAnother thing, which is really just icing on the cake honestly, Pain knew *exactly* what he was getting himself into fighting a Jinchuriki. Just like when he fought the other Jinchuriki. Naruto just happened to be the only Jinchuriki who didn't need to use his tailed beast to whoop his ass. Pain knew the risks, he just lost. It's quite literally that simple.\n\nEven Minato \"helped\" Naruto here more than the 9-tails did. I don't know who never told any of you this, but Kurama was never helping Naruto. He took over and intended to just kill everyone and everything. When he broke out of the chibaku tensei, *Kurama* was the one who broke out of it. It was literally Minato that fixed Naruto's seal and have him return normal again. \n\nKurama did nothing to Pain that made him any weaker after their brief scuffle. Only person truly affected by it was Nagato. Pain was perfectly fine, and was in the same condition after the fight with 6-tails Naruto that he was in before it. Pain simply was a dead person being used as a vessel to fight. He doesn't have stamina. He doesn't feel pain. He doesn't have chakra reserves. He can spam as many rinnegan abilities as he'd like and there wouldn't be any consequences of it except a weak ass cooldown timer. But let's just ignore that, right?\n\nIt's hilarious how much random shit people chalk up to Kurama honestly.",

The same *exact* condition. Only difference was he didn't have 5 other pains to assist him. It was just a 1v1 with sage mode Naruto.\n\nWhat good is the 9 tails breaking out of the chibaku tensei if Naruto ceases to exist? Then Pain loses. Nagato loses. Naruto loses. The leaf village loses. Everyone loses.\n\nEdit: If people truly felt as though the 9 tails hindered Pain in any way whatsoever just by fighting him, then why does nobody bring up how Pain literally fought the entire leaf village before Naruto ever even showed up? That he was tired even before Naruto showed up? You know why that argument is never used? Because you all already know it's a stupid ass argument. So cut the shit.",

He had expended a lot, but it had no noticeable affects on his ability to control Pain. His movements and reactions were still the same speed. He was still able to use almighty push and universal pull to the same extent, there wasn't even an extended cooldown where he couldn't use his powers anymore, like there was when he destroyed the village. The Diva Path of Pain was essentially completely unaffected from that fight. It's a corpse being manipulated and as long as Nagato still has the chakra to control it (which he did, he had plenty) it won't go down or get weaker.\n\nAs for the Minato thing, the guy isn't saying that Minato directly helped Naruto defeat Pain in the same physical way Kurama did. He's saying Kurama wasn't helping Naruto, at least not intentionally. Kurama was just destroying everything for the sake of destroying everything. Pain happened to be the closest thing around, so Kurama did its best to kill him. After the 7 tail or so, Naruto was no longer even remotely in control. Minato helped him by rebuilding the seal, and giving Naruto another chance to take down Pain without succumbing to the 9 tails, which would've effectively killed him.",

But my god, every time you say something I can feel my brain cells shrieking in agony before committing mass suicide. You are right about one thing though, it's true that Naruto couldn't have won if Kurama hadn't broken out of the chibaku tensei. However, no one was saying otherwise or at least I wasn't. What *I* was saying is that Pain was effectively uninhibited by the fight with Kurama. Now the keyword there is \"effectively,\" if you can understand the meaning of the word in this context. Narratively speaking yes, Nagato was affected greatly by the immense amount of chakra he had to use to fight Kurama. However immediately after the fact, when Naruto is in control again, he goes right back to spamming Almighty Push and Universal Pull to the exact same effect. His movement and reaction speed hasn't decreased at all, he didn't have a longer cooldown on Almighty Push, Almighty Push isn't noticeably weaker, and the corpse that Pain was made of hadn't suffered any grievous wounds. And none of this is speculation, it's visibly demonstrable. You can quite literally look at that chapter of the manga and see that what I'm saying is true, and the anime is no different.",

If someone's gotta resort to dirty tactics to gain the upper hand on their opponent that alone should tell you how the fight would go between them, pretty much exactly like how it ended up going anyway. Delta only resorted to using Naruto's kids as bait because she felt she wasn't getting anywhere currently and that's pretty much the same exact situation Pain was in against Sage Mode Naruto.",

Your foolish tenacity has been acknowledged. But this is a battle that you shall lose all the same, because if the argument is that Naruto couldn't have won without Kurama, then the solution for me is even simpler than before. Naruto not only could've won without Kurama, but absolutely would have if it weren't for Ma and Pa. Their presence was a hindrance more than it was a help. Pa attempted to use the same genjutsu on Pain that they'd used with Jiraiya when they first fought Pain, which immediately prompted him to kill Pa. Naruto's attempt to save them is what got him caught and things went downhill from there. If they simply hadn't been present, or otherwise hadn't been attacked, Naruto would've won by himself in the exact same way he ultimately did anyways. The only difference is that it would've been without Kurama's intervention.",

I'm the troll? Interesting. I do believe I made it quite clear that I don't care about the discussion earlier. I hardly considered it an argument, let alone a matter of winning or losing. It's an anime and I don't put genuine effort or emotional investment into discussions about fictional characters or settings. However, I did raise actual points. I made sound arguments backed by evidence. You on the other hand quite literally just kept repeating yourself again and again,. \"Lma0\" this, \"actually\" that, and you never once explained your reasoning or gave any sort of evidence as to your point. Clearly you care about winning far more than I do, since you're still prattling on about it, whereas I had already moved on and attempted to end the discussion quite concisely. So unless the meaning of the word has changed in the last hour or so, I don't believe I'm the troll here. But once again, I extend to you permission to believe whatever you so desire. I don't care. And feel free to continue proving my point; you are a slave to your most toxic habits. You're still here because you're unable to stop. You simply must have the last word. You can't help it.

All he did was level up and block shit. Somehow that translated into \"lOl hEs rEaLlY oP nOw\" to these Madara fanboys even though he didn't even do anything.\n\nEdit: About Limbo, people overexaggerate how OP it is. It's definitely OP against people who either can't see it or sense it, but Naruto and Sasuke could both sense or see them. In the anime, Naruto decides to make 1 shadow clone per limbo clone when he could've just dumped 20 on them to overwhelm them and keep them busy as he and Sasuke went after the real Madara.\n\nThe Limbo clones are literally no different than regular clones when everyone in the battle can also see them. Only difference is they don't poof after taking too much damage. We actually don't even know what happens to them if they take too much damage.",

And Rinne Sharingan is stronger than Rinnegan, so he should scale above Naruto and Sasuke at this point. Not to mention fact that he is more versitile.\n\nI understand the thought process, but no. He never once proved to be above them. All of his buffs absolutely pale in compairson to Kaguya and her power, and again, we saw how well Naruto was handling himself against her. He was doing *more* than just \"handling\" himself. He was actually soloing her by himself. \n\nThe point is Juubidara pales in comparison to her, and even Kaguya herself wasn't enough to completely overwhelm them. Naruto and Sasuke with their six paths powers during the war were far more powerful than anyone gave them credit for. And Madara wasn't more versatile than they were. It's funny, because as much as people were saying Juubidara was holding back/hiding power, so were Naruto and Sasuke. Naruto only made 4 clones to fight the Limbo clones instead of making like 10 or 500, and he never used boil release on him yet. And just like how his Limbo clones could use Susanoo, Naruto's shadow clones can all manifest the Kurama avatar. He could also literally use 3 headed Kurama at any given moment as well. Could also probably give Sasuke some bijuu chakra to amp his Susanoo like Sasuke did in their fight against each other.\n\n>You never showed scan of them being able to even touch him after getting Six Paths Power.\n\nThat's never been the discussion. We're talking about the misconception Madara was \"above\" them, despite his feats heavily suggesting otherwise.",

When he matched her power on *numerous* occasions. How he was controlling the battle against her with his shadow clones. \n\nIt doesn't matter if she was serious or not, not when even when she did decide to get serious and try to kill Naruto and Sasuke, she was still utterly incapable of doing it.\n\n>But she wasn't serious, and wanted his Chakra. Few moments later she litteraly slaps him.\n\n\nLmao, \"slaps\". All you seem to be able to do is turn an ant-hill into a mountain. She pushed him back and poofed clones. She never once landed any real attacks on him, nor was she able to damage either of these kids to any significant degree the *entire* battle. In fact, she performed so poorly against these kids they both evidently had the energy to immediately fight each other for almost an entire 24 hours because Kaguya clearly couldn't even tire them out the entire time she fought them.\n\n\n\n>He is one pearson and he has both of Naruto's and Sasuke's Main powers(Tailed beast/Sage Mode and EMS/Rinnegan). In both cases better than theirs.\n\nCompletely irrelevant, and absolutely *nothing* proves or suggests he was better than them with their own powers. What he was to them was *stronger* than them individually. That's it.\n\n>Clones might be a problem, tho Madara knows Shinra Tensei and other large scale attacks. He also should have Xhakra at least comparable to Naruto, and spam wood clones.\n\nNothing in his arsenal will be enough to stop his clones. Not when Naruto can simply make more.\n\n>Would need to gather nature energy first, it would take some time.\n\nWhich would be easy. Madara's too focused on everything and everyone else in the battle to care about what that 1 clone is doing. He wouldn't even notice a clone leaving, let alone stopping it from doing what it's gonna do. He'd need to get past Naruto first for that.\n\n\n>Sasuke isn't really a problem here. He doesn't scale to Naruto, so he doesn't have any feats to put him on level of upper Six Paths characters.\n\nHe's literally directly comparable to Naruto. It's hard to take you seriously when you repeatedly say shit like this bro. No he isn't stronger than Naruto, but he's still in the same tier as him and directly comparable *to* him.\n\n>It's also worth noting, that all Madara needs to do is killing Sasuke. After that, he can use Mugen Tsukiyome and it's GG.\n\nHe's not gonna kill Sasuke. Sasuke's hax makes up for what power he lacks, that's always been common knowledge.",

Madara was just gonna get curbstomped.

Akira even drew a doodle of SS4 for the og showcreators, which supposedly was gonna be used for inspiration for SSGod, but we got Goku with red highlights instead in the finalised BotGs movie.\n\nPersonally it would've been better to give Boruto Next Gen the GT approach completely to give the main manga writer more creativity in terms of storytelling, so then if it failed Kishi could've just started over like Super did, but I digress.",

If Amado can make cyborgs that easily rival Gigen who destroyed pre-nerf Naruto and Sasuke, then I see no reason why orochimaru who has way more knowledge in chakra and Ninjutsu and created someone like Mitsuki with sage mode imbedded since birth, cannot do something similar, let alone something basic like genjutsu immunity that all Kara members have btw.

So in terms of results, a lot of people have been spared, Kakashi didn't die, there's enough time to evacuate the village so even if Tendo Pain goes high up and nukes the village, there would be nearly no casualties. In reality, there were a lot of dead and casualties, Tsunade tried to cover her mistake by healing the injured but if it wasn't for Naruto of for talk no jutsu, the results would be catastrophic. \n\nNow regarding Tendo Pain, like I said Jiraiya had plenty of assets, just to name a few:\n\n- He summons his toad cage to imprison the path, shinra tensei may have an effect but still hindered\n\n- He attaches himself to Pain with his hair technique to keep the same distance despite shinra tensei, not to forget the toad grandparents also attached to Jiraiya\n\n- He has very long distance attacks such has fire jutsu empowered by toad oil, the reason Naruto struggled so much was because he only had rasengan as attack and his only long distance one was rasenshuriken which he couldn't control its trajectory. The only solution Naruto had was spam clones and force Pain to spam shinra tensei then make profit of the cooldown, Jiraiya can counter it way more easily with long distance attacks\n\nTell me how this is wrong",

It's not up to me to prove something doesn't exist, it's up to you to prove me wrong.\n\nAnd yes, she should've went straight to the frontline. The hokage post implies fighting for the village, defending it, be willing to sacrifice themselves for the others. As you told this might be stupid idea egoistically  speaking, but that only proves she's egoistical just like the corrupted politicians who create suffering for their own profit like sending people to unnecessary wars or like Tsunade deploying every ninja as canon fodder so that Pain doesn't reach the hokage office.

If Naruto was late, the whole village and everyone would be killed, then Pain would move because seeing Naruto isn't nearby, and bye bye plot convenience reviving everyone.\n\nYou still couldn't state a single good action she did during her mandate, which proves my point that you're most likely deluded 13 y.o. fangirl",

Tsunade debated the 4th raikage and convinced him to have Killer B to train Naruto to become a perfect jinchuriki .Without Tsunade Naruto would've not got the KCM 1 and 2 .\n\n2. Shikamaru, Gaara, Kakashi, Sakura, Iruka and Jiraya, basically all of Naruto's \" friends \" tried to stop Naruto to go after Sasuke .Jiraya even called Naruto stupid for doing it .Meanwhile Tsunade was the only person who had faith in Naruto and supported in him to save Sasuke .\nAnd as Sasuke said when they finished their battle and had their arms ripped in blood, the only reason why he accepted Naruto's friendship is because of Naruto's attempts to save him, \" attempts \" that would've not happend if Tsunade would've not SUPPORTED HIM or if Jiraya/Tobirama would've been hokages in her place .\nSo the reason why Sasuke is good and back again, is because of Tsunade's faith in Naruto .\n\n3. Tsunade saved Jiraya's overrated ass at the 3rd way deadlock from Orochimaru when they were young. \nSo Naruto only had Jiraya as sensei because of Tsunade .\n\n4. Tsunade saved Naruto's family Kakashi and Sasuke from Itachi's dumbass to putt this 2 in Tsukuyomi ( Naruto called team 7 his family ) .\n\n5. Tsunade saved the imbecile stupid ass of Naruto's future wife Hinata, who saved Naruto from Pain .\nNo Tsunade, No Hinata, No Hinata no Minato, No Minato no Naruto saving the village .\n\n6. Tsunade teached the medical jutsu to Sakura who saved Hinata's garbage bitchass twice and who saved Naruto's life when she litteraly holded Naruto's fucking heart in her palm .\n\n7. Tsunade saved Naruto's friend Rock Lee from being habdicapped .\n\n8. Tsunade saved Naruto's friend Gaara from Madara, when she also saved the other kages with her last breath .\n\n9. According to Jiraya Tsunade is the biggest reason of winning the second shinobi world war, and unlike Naruto who got his ass carried by Kurama and who got roided with S06P bullshit powers over the night for which he didn't trained 1 second, Tsunade STOMPED the war only with HER OWN SKILL .\n\n10 .Tsunade didn't killed Jiraya's dumass, Tsunade tried to convince him to not go, than she offered herself to help Jiraya by going with him, but his cornflake stupid ass declined both of her offers, so he deserved to die .\n\n11. Of all the 5 kages, despite being a support type shinobi, Tsunade had the most attack shots at Madara, she's the only one who physically touched him, and she did this while carrying the other kages with healing and chakra reserves .Meanwhile Onoki was carried by Tsunade's heal/chakra and by raikage's speed .Tsunade was the mvp, despite Madara destroying them .\n\nTsunade isn't overrated, Tsunade is hella UNDERRATED .She did more than Naruto as hokage, she did much more for Naruto than Jiraya did for him, and she did much more for Naruto, than Naruto has done for her .\n\nYou're just another mentally retarded butthurted Naruto cornfalke simp who has no ideea of how the things happened in the series.\nThis post is garbage, just like the video from YouTube from which you stoled this thumbnail . \n\nGo ahead, report me for exposing your stupidity .",

Pain used the toads to his advantage the same way Delta used Naruto's kids to her advantage. He literally tosses Pa toad into Naruto's arms to keep him from countering as he almighty pulls him into a choke slam. If he hadn't endangered them, Naruto would've simply went Sage Mode again using the last clone he had left and bodied him, that's painfully evident, especially since that's what he ends up doing anyway after his 9-tails rampage.\"*\n\n*\"I find it pretty weird people always seem to conveniently forget certain details in order to discredit Naruto.\"*\n\nThere seriously is this really, really weird thing people like to do where they like to treat Naruto and Kurama as if they're separate powers. They're not. Jinchuriki aren't separate from their tailed beast, and that's just the simple reality of the situation. If they are, then tell Sasuke to put his eyes back in Itachi's sockets in the grave. Tell Madara to return every amp he ever took or stole back where he got it from. Tell Killer Bee he isn't even worth a pile of shit without his 8 tails always \"helping\" him like it did against Taka Sasuke and Kisame, and Gaara and the other Jinchuriki as well. Tell Obito it was really the ten tails doing all the work in his unstable condition and he had absolutely no part in it. \n\nYou see how far that gets you? About as far as I can throw you.\n\nAnother thing, which is really just icing on the cake honestly, Pain knew *exactly* what he was getting himself into fighting a Jinchuriki. Just like when he fought the other Jinchuriki. Naruto just happened to be the only Jinchuriki who didn't need to use his tailed beast to whoop his ass. Pain knew the risks, he just lost. It's quite literally that simple.\n\nEven Minato \"helped\" Naruto here more than the 9-tails did. I don't know who never told any of you this, but Kurama was never helping Naruto. He took over and intended to just kill everyone and everything. When he broke out of the chibaku tensei, *Kurama* was the one who broke out of it. It was literally Minato that fixed Naruto's seal and have him return normal again. \n\nKurama did nothing to Pain that made him any weaker after their brief scuffle. Only person truly affected by it was Nagato. Pain was perfectly fine, and was in the same condition after the fight with 6-tails Naruto that he was in before it. Pain simply was a dead person being used as a vessel to fight. He doesn't have stamina. He doesn't feel pain. He doesn't have chakra reserves. He can spam as many rinnegan abilities as he'd like and there wouldn't be any consequences of it except a weak ass cooldown timer. But let's just ignore that, right?\n\nIt's hilarious how much random shit people chalk up to Kurama honestly.",

He had expended a lot, but it had no noticeable affects on his ability to control Pain. His movements and reactions were still the same speed. He was still able to use almighty push and universal pull to the same extent, there wasn't even an extended cooldown where he couldn't use his powers anymore, like there was when he destroyed the village. The Diva Path of Pain was essentially completely unaffected from that fight. It's a corpse being manipulated and as long as Nagato still has the chakra to control it (which he did, he had plenty) it won't go down or get weaker.\n\nAs for the Minato thing, the guy isn't saying that Minato directly helped Naruto defeat Pain in the same physical way Kurama did. He's saying Kurama wasn't helping Naruto, at least not intentionally. Kurama was just destroying everything for the sake of destroying everything. Pain happened to be the closest thing around, so Kurama did its best to kill him. After the 7 tail or so, Naruto was no longer even remotely in control. Minato helped him by rebuilding the seal, and giving Naruto another chance to take down Pain without succumbing to the 9 tails, which would've effectively killed him.",

You are right about one thing though, it's true that Naruto couldn't have won if Kurama hadn't broken out of the chibaku tensei. However, no one was saying otherwise or at least I wasn't. What *I* was saying is that Pain was effectively uninhibited by the fight with Kurama. Now the keyword there is \"effectively,\" if you can understand the meaning of the word in this context. Narratively speaking yes, Nagato was affected greatly by the immense amount of chakra he had to use to fight Kurama. However immediately after the fact, when Naruto is in control again, he goes right back to spamming Almighty Push and Universal Pull to the exact same effect. His movement and reaction speed hasn't decreased at all, he didn't have a longer cooldown on Almighty Push, Almighty Push isn't noticeably weaker, and the corpse that Pain was made of hadn't suffered any grievous wounds. And none of this is speculation, it's visibly demonstrable. You can quite literally look at that chapter of the manga and see that what I'm saying is true, and the anime is no different.",

If someone's gotta resort to dirty tactics to gain the upper hand on their opponent that alone should tell you how the fight would go between them, pretty much exactly like how it ended up going anyway. Delta only resorted to using Naruto's kids as bait because she felt she wasn't getting anywhere currently and that's pretty much the same exact situation Pain was in against Sage Mode Naruto.",

But hey, good job moving the goalposts in a desperate but futile attempt to salvage some shred of dignity as you fall deeper into the pit of ignorance and insignificance. Your foolish tenacity has been acknowledged. But this is a battle that you shall lose all the same, because if the argument is that Naruto couldn't have won without Kurama, then the solution for me is even simpler than before. Naruto not only could've won without Kurama, but absolutely would have if it weren't for Ma and Pa. Their presence was a hindrance more than it was a help. Pa attempted to use the same genjutsu on Pain that they'd used with Jiraiya when they first fought Pain, which immediately prompted him to kill Pa. Naruto's attempt to save them is what got him caught and things went downhill from there. If they simply hadn't been present, or otherwise hadn't been attacked, Naruto would've won by himself in the exact same way he ultimately did anyways. The only difference is that it would've been without Kurama's intervention.",

I'm the troll? Interesting. I do believe I made it quite clear that I don't care about the discussion earlier. I hardly considered it an argument, let alone a matter of winning or losing. It's an anime and I don't put genuine effort or emotional investment into discussions about fictional characters or settings. However, I did raise actual points. I made sound arguments backed by evidence. You on the other hand quite literally just kept repeating yourself again and again,. \"Lma0\" this, \"actually\" that, and you never once explained your reasoning or gave any sort of evidence as to your point. Clearly you care about winning far more than I do, since you're still prattling on about it, whereas I had already moved on and attempted to end the discussion quite concisely. So unless the meaning of the word has changed in the last hour or so, I don't believe I'm the troll here. But once again, I extend to you permission to believe whatever you so desire. I don't care. And feel free to continue proving my point; you are a slave to your most toxic habits. You're still here because you're unable to stop. You simply must have the last word. You can't help it.

They were gonna go clean through him like they did Momoshiki when they were older lmao. He couldn't land anything on them, he couldn't do anything. All he did was level up and block shit. Somehow that translated into \"lOl hEs rEaLlY oP nOw\" to these Madara fanboys even though he didn't even do anything.\n\nEdit: About Limbo, people overexaggerate how OP it is. It's definitely OP against people who either can't see it or sense it, but Naruto and Sasuke could both sense or see them. In the anime, Naruto decides to make 1 shadow clone per limbo clone when he could've just dumped 20 on them to overwhelm them and keep them busy as he and Sasuke went after the real Madara.\n\nThe Limbo clones are literally no different than regular clones when everyone in the battle can also see them. Only difference is they don't poof after taking too much damage. We actually don't even know what happens to them if they take too much damage.",

And Rinne Sharingan is stronger than Rinnegan, so he should scale above Naruto and Sasuke at this point. Not to mention fact that he is more versitile.\n\nI understand the thought process, but no. He never once proved to be above them. All of his buffs absolutely pale in compairson to Kaguya and her power, and again, we saw how well Naruto was handling himself against her. He was doing *more* than just \"handling\" himself. He was actually soloing her by himself. \n\nThe point is Juubidara pales in comparison to her, and even Kaguya herself wasn't enough to completely overwhelm them. Naruto and Sasuke with their six paths powers during the war were far more powerful than anyone gave them credit for. And Madara wasn't more versatile than they were. It's funny, because as much as people were saying Juubidara was holding back/hiding power, so were Naruto and Sasuke. Naruto only made 4 clones to fight the Limbo clones instead of making like 10 or 500, and he never used boil release on him yet. And just like how his Limbo clones could use Susanoo, Naruto's shadow clones can all manifest the Kurama avatar. He could also literally use 3 headed Kurama at any given moment as well. Could also probably give Sasuke some bijuu chakra to amp his Susanoo like Sasuke did in their fight against each other.\n\n>You never showed scan of them being able to even touch him after getting Six Paths Power.\n\nThat's never been the discussion. We're talking about the misconception Madara was \"above\" them, despite his feats heavily suggesting otherwise.",

When he matched her power on *numerous* occasions. How he was controlling the battle against her with his shadow clones. \n\nIt doesn't matter if she was serious or not, not when even when she did decide to get serious and try to kill Naruto and Sasuke, she was still utterly incapable of doing it.\n\n>But she wasn't serious, and wanted his Chakra. Few moments later she litteraly slaps him.\n\n\nLmao, \"slaps\". All you seem to be able to do is turn an ant-hill into a mountain. She pushed him back and poofed clones. She never once landed any real attacks on him, nor was she able to damage either of these kids to any significant degree the *entire* battle. In fact, she performed so poorly against these kids they both evidently had the energy to immediately fight each other for almost an entire 24 hours because Kaguya clearly couldn't even tire them out the entire time she fought them.\n\n\n\n>He is one pearson and he has both of Naruto's and Sasuke's Main powers(Tailed beast/Sage Mode and EMS/Rinnegan). In both cases better than theirs.\n\nCompletely irrelevant, and absolutely *nothing* proves or suggests he was better than them with their own powers. What he was to them was *stronger* than them individually. That's it.\n\n>Clones might be a problem, tho Madara knows Shinra Tensei and other large scale attacks. He also should have Xhakra at least comparable to Naruto, and spam wood clones.\n\nNothing in his arsenal will be enough to stop his clones. Not when Naruto can simply make more.\n\n>Would need to gather nature energy first, it would take some time.\n\nWhich would be easy. Madara's too focused on everything and everyone else in the battle to care about what that 1 clone is doing. He wouldn't even notice a clone leaving, let alone stopping it from doing what it's gonna do. He'd need to get past Naruto first for that.\n\n\n>Sasuke isn't really a problem here. He doesn't scale to Naruto, so he doesn't have any feats to put him on level of upper Six Paths characters.\n\nHe's literally directly comparable to Naruto. It's hard to take you seriously when you repeatedly say shit like this bro. No he isn't stronger than Naruto, but he's still in the same tier as him and directly comparable *to* him.\n\n>It's also worth noting, that all Madara needs to do is killing Sasuke. After that, he can use Mugen Tsukiyome and it's GG.\n\nHe's not gonna kill Sasuke. Sasuke's hax makes up for what power he lacks, that's always been common knowledge.",

If Amado can make cyborgs that easily rival Gigen who destroyed pre-nerf Naruto and Sasuke, then I see no reason why orochimaru who has way more knowledge in chakra and Ninjutsu and created someone like Mitsuki with sage mode imbedded since birth, cannot do something similar, let alone something basic like genjutsu immunity that all Kara members have btw.

In addition, jiraiya no longer has the liberty to gather information on each pain and take time to figure out the link because he has to worry about protecting each person in the village.",

So in terms of results, a lot of people have been spared, Kakashi didn't die, there's enough time to evacuate the village so even if Tendo Pain goes high up and nukes the village, there would be nearly no casualties. In reality, there were a lot of dead and casualties, Tsunade tried to cover her mistake by healing the injured but if it wasn't for Naruto of for talk no jutsu, the results would be catastrophic. \n\nNow regarding Tendo Pain, like I said Jiraiya had plenty of assets, just to name a few:\n\n- He summons his toad cage to imprison the path, shinra tensei may have an effect but still hindered\n\n- He attaches himself to Pain with his hair technique to keep the same distance despite shinra tensei, not to forget the toad grandparents also attached to Jiraiya\n\n- He has very long distance attacks such has fire jutsu empowered by toad oil, the reason Naruto struggled so much was because he only had rasengan as attack and his only long distance one was rasenshuriken which he couldn't control its trajectory. The only solution Naruto had was spam clones and force Pain to spam shinra tensei then make profit of the cooldown, Jiraiya can counter it way more easily with long distance attacks\n\nTell me how this is wrong",

Tsunade debated the 4th raikage and convinced him to have Killer B to train Naruto to become a perfect jinchuriki .Without Tsunade Naruto would've not got the KCM 1 and 2 .\n\n2. Shikamaru, Gaara, Kakashi, Sakura, Iruka and Jiraya, basically all of Naruto's \" friends \" tried to stop Naruto to go after Sasuke .Jiraya even called Naruto stupid for doing it .Meanwhile Tsunade was the only person who had faith in Naruto and supported in him to save Sasuke .\nAnd as Sasuke said when they finished their battle and had their arms ripped in blood, the only reason why he accepted Naruto's friendship is because of Naruto's attempts to save him, \" attempts \" that would've not happend if Tsunade would've not SUPPORTED HIM or if Jiraya/Tobirama would've been hokages in her place .\nSo the reason why Sasuke is good and back again, is because of Tsunade's faith in Naruto .\n\n3. Tsunade saved Jiraya's overrated ass at the 3rd way deadlock from Orochimaru when they were young. \nSo Naruto only had Jiraya as sensei because of Tsunade .\n\n4. Tsunade saved Naruto's family Kakashi and Sasuke from Itachi's dumbass to putt this 2 in Tsukuyomi ( Naruto called team 7 his family ) .\n\n5. Tsunade saved the imbecile stupid ass of Naruto's future wife Hinata, who saved Naruto from Pain .\nNo Tsunade, No Hinata, No Hinata no Minato, No Minato no Naruto saving the village .\n\n6. Tsunade teached the medical jutsu to Sakura who saved Hinata's garbage bitchass twice and who saved Naruto's life when she litteraly holded Naruto's fucking heart in her palm .\n\n7. Tsunade saved Naruto's friend Rock Lee from being habdicapped .\n\n8. Tsunade saved Naruto's friend Gaara from Madara, when she also saved the other kages with her last breath .\n\n9. According to Jiraya Tsunade is the biggest reason of winning the second shinobi world war, and unlike Naruto who got his ass carried by Kurama and who got roided with S06P bullshit powers over the night for which he didn't trained 1 second, Tsunade STOMPED the war only with HER OWN SKILL .\n\n10 .Tsunade didn't killed Jiraya's dumass, Tsunade tried to convince him to not go, than she offered herself to help Jiraya by going with him, but his cornflake stupid ass declined both of her offers, so he deserved to die .\n\n11. Of all the 5 kages, despite being a support type shinobi, Tsunade had the most attack shots at Madara, she's the only one who physically touched him, and she did this while carrying the other kages with healing and chakra reserves .Meanwhile Onoki was carried by Tsunade's heal/chakra and by raikage's speed .Tsunade was the mvp, despite Madara destroying them .\n\nTsunade isn't overrated, Tsunade is hella UNDERRATED .She did more than Naruto as hokage, she did much more for Naruto than Jiraya did for him, and she did much more for Naruto, than Naruto has done for her .\n\nYou're just another mentally retarded butthurted Naruto cornfalke simp who has no ideea of how the things happened in the series.\nThis post is garbage, just like the video from YouTube from which you stoled this thumbnail . \n\nGo ahead, report me for exposing your stupidity .",

He literally tosses Pa toad into Naruto's arms to keep him from countering as he almighty pulls him into a choke slam. If he hadn't endangered them, Naruto would've simply went Sage Mode again using the last clone he had left and bodied him, that's painfully evident, especially since that's what he ends up doing anyway after his 9-tails rampage.\"*\n\n*\"I find it pretty weird people always seem to conveniently forget certain details in order to discredit Naruto.\"*\n\nThere seriously is this really, really weird thing people like to do where they like to treat Naruto and Kurama as if they're separate powers. They're not. Jinchuriki aren't separate from their tailed beast, and that's just the simple reality of the situation. If they are, then tell Sasuke to put his eyes back in Itachi's sockets in the grave. Tell Madara to return every amp he ever took or stole back where he got it from. Tell Killer Bee he isn't even worth a pile of shit without his 8 tails always \"helping\" him like it did against Taka Sasuke and Kisame, and Gaara and the other Jinchuriki as well. Tell Obito it was really the ten tails doing all the work in his unstable condition and he had absolutely no part in it. \n\nYou see how far that gets you? About as far as I can throw you.\n\nAnother thing, which is really just icing on the cake honestly, Pain knew *exactly* what he was getting himself into fighting a Jinchuriki. Just like when he fought the other Jinchuriki. Naruto just happened to be the only Jinchuriki who didn't need to use his tailed beast to whoop his ass. Pain knew the risks, he just lost. It's quite literally that simple.\n\nEven Minato \"helped\" Naruto here more than the 9-tails did. I don't know who never told any of you this, but Kurama was never helping Naruto. He took over and intended to just kill everyone and everything. When he broke out of the chibaku tensei, *Kurama* was the one who broke out of it. It was literally Minato that fixed Naruto's seal and have him return normal again. \n\nKurama did nothing to Pain that made him any weaker after their brief scuffle. Only person truly affected by it was Nagato. Pain was perfectly fine, and was in the same condition after the fight with 6-tails Naruto that he was in before it. Pain simply was a dead person being used as a vessel to fight. He doesn't have stamina. He doesn't feel pain. He doesn't have chakra reserves. He can spam as many rinnegan abilities as he'd like and there wouldn't be any consequences of it except a weak ass cooldown timer. But let's just ignore that, right?\n\nIt's hilarious how much random shit people chalk up to Kurama honestly.",

He had expended a lot, but it had no noticeable affects on his ability to control Pain. His movements and reactions were still the same speed. He was still able to use almighty push and universal pull to the same extent, there wasn't even an extended cooldown where he couldn't use his powers anymore, like there was when he destroyed the village. The Diva Path of Pain was essentially completely unaffected from that fight. It's a corpse being manipulated and as long as Nagato still has the chakra to control it (which he did, he had plenty) it won't go down or get weaker.\n\nAs for the Minato thing, the guy isn't saying that Minato directly helped Naruto defeat Pain in the same physical way Kurama did. He's saying Kurama wasn't helping Naruto, at least not intentionally. Kurama was just destroying everything for the sake of destroying everything. Pain happened to be the closest thing around, so Kurama did its best to kill him. After the 7 tail or so, Naruto was no longer even remotely in control. Minato helped him by rebuilding the seal, and giving Naruto another chance to take down Pain without succumbing to the 9 tails, which would've effectively killed him.",

But my god, every time you say something I can feel my brain cells shrieking in agony before committing mass suicide. You are right about one thing though, it's true that Naruto couldn't have won if Kurama hadn't broken out of the chibaku tensei. However, no one was saying otherwise or at least I wasn't. What *I* was saying is that Pain was effectively uninhibited by the fight with Kurama. Now the keyword there is \"effectively,\" if you can understand the meaning of the word in this context. Narratively speaking yes, Nagato was affected greatly by the immense amount of chakra he had to use to fight Kurama. However immediately after the fact, when Naruto is in control again, he goes right back to spamming Almighty Push and Universal Pull to the exact same effect. His movement and reaction speed hasn't decreased at all, he didn't have a longer cooldown on Almighty Push, Almighty Push isn't noticeably weaker, and the corpse that Pain was made of hadn't suffered any grievous wounds. And none of this is speculation, it's visibly demonstrable. You can quite literally look at that chapter of the manga and see that what I'm saying is true, and the anime is no different.",

If someone's gotta resort to dirty tactics to gain the upper hand on their opponent that alone should tell you how the fight would go between them, pretty much exactly like how it ended up going anyway. Delta only resorted to using Naruto's kids as bait because she felt she wasn't getting anywhere currently and that's pretty much the same exact situation Pain was in against Sage Mode Naruto.",

Your foolish tenacity has been acknowledged. But this is a battle that you shall lose all the same, because if the argument is that Naruto couldn't have won without Kurama, then the solution for me is even simpler than before. Naruto not only could've won without Kurama, but absolutely would have if it weren't for Ma and Pa. Their presence was a hindrance more than it was a help. Pa attempted to use the same genjutsu on Pain that they'd used with Jiraiya when they first fought Pain, which immediately prompted him to kill Pa. Naruto's attempt to save them is what got him caught and things went downhill from there. If they simply hadn't been present, or otherwise hadn't been attacked, Naruto would've won by himself in the exact same way he ultimately did anyways. The only difference is that it would've been without Kurama's intervention.",

I could say the same to you. You could just as easily accept your supposed victory and cease this asinine display. But you won't. And I know you won't. You're a troll, and just like every other troll on the internet you're dreadfully predictable. You accost others with performative idiocy, dragging them down to your level and beating them with experience. You seek a reaction above all else, and simply stopping won't give you the satisfaction of winning you worked so hard for. So you won't stop. You can't. How very pathetic.",

I'm the troll? Interesting. I do believe I made it quite clear that I don't care about the discussion earlier. I hardly considered it an argument, let alone a matter of winning or losing. It's an anime and I don't put genuine effort or emotional investment into discussions about fictional characters or settings. However, I did raise actual points. I made sound arguments backed by evidence. You on the other hand quite literally just kept repeating yourself again and again,. \"Lma0\" this, \"actually\" that, and you never once explained your reasoning or gave any sort of evidence as to your point. Clearly you care about winning far more than I do, since you're still prattling on about it, whereas I had already moved on and attempted to end the discussion quite concisely. So unless the meaning of the word has changed in the last hour or so, I don't believe I'm the troll here. But once again, I extend to you permission to believe whatever you so desire. I don't care. And feel free to continue proving my point; you are a slave to your most toxic habits. You're still here because you're unable to stop. You simply must have the last word. You can't help it.

They were gonna go clean through him like they did Momoshiki when they were older lmao. He couldn't land anything on them, he couldn't do anything. All he did was level up and block shit. Somehow that translated into \"lOl hEs rEaLlY oP nOw\" to these Madara fanboys even though he didn't even do anything.\n\nEdit: About Limbo, people overexaggerate how OP it is. It's definitely OP against people who either can't see it or sense it, but Naruto and Sasuke could both sense or see them. In the anime, Naruto decides to make 1 shadow clone per limbo clone when he could've just dumped 20 on them to overwhelm them and keep them busy as he and Sasuke went after the real Madara.\n\nThe Limbo clones are literally no different than regular clones when everyone in the battle can also see them. Only difference is they don't poof after taking too much damage. We actually don't even know what happens to them if they take too much damage.",

All his powerup did was make him go from getting speed blitzed by Naruto and Sasuke and slapped by massive lavastyle rasenshuriken instantly like he was previously doing, to being able to actually fight them now, especially with the Limbo clones to assist.\n\nYour inability to show a scan of him actually having any kind of upper hand against them after his massive buff already proves my point. You resort to overexaggerating simple feats like blocks or trying to use his entrance as some kind of \"proof\" when literally none of that helps support your argument even in the slightest. You're just grasping at straws, grasping at anything to keep deluding yourself he was somehow \"above\" them.",

And Rinne Sharingan is stronger than Rinnegan, so he should scale above Naruto and Sasuke at this point. Not to mention fact that he is more versitile.\n\nI understand the thought process, but no. He never once proved to be above them. All of his buffs absolutely pale in compairson to Kaguya and her power, and again, we saw how well Naruto was handling himself against her. He was doing *more* than just \"handling\" himself. He was actually soloing her by himself. \n\nThe point is Juubidara pales in comparison to her, and even Kaguya herself wasn't enough to completely overwhelm them. Naruto and Sasuke with their six paths powers during the war were far more powerful than anyone gave them credit for. And Madara wasn't more versatile than they were. It's funny, because as much as people were saying Juubidara was holding back/hiding power, so were Naruto and Sasuke. Naruto only made 4 clones to fight the Limbo clones instead of making like 10 or 500, and he never used boil release on him yet. And just like how his Limbo clones could use Susanoo, Naruto's shadow clones can all manifest the Kurama avatar. He could also literally use 3 headed Kurama at any given moment as well. Could also probably give Sasuke some bijuu chakra to amp his Susanoo like Sasuke did in their fight against each other.\n\n>You never showed scan of them being able to even touch him after getting Six Paths Power.\n\nThat's never been the discussion. We're talking about the misconception Madara was \"above\" them, despite his feats heavily suggesting otherwise.",

When he matched her power on *numerous* occasions. How he was controlling the battle against her with his shadow clones. \n\nIt doesn't matter if she was serious or not, not when even when she did decide to get serious and try to kill Naruto and Sasuke, she was still utterly incapable of doing it.\n\n>But she wasn't serious, and wanted his Chakra. Few moments later she litteraly slaps him.\n\n\nLmao, \"slaps\". All you seem to be able to do is turn an ant-hill into a mountain. She pushed him back and poofed clones. She never once landed any real attacks on him, nor was she able to damage either of these kids to any significant degree the *entire* battle. In fact, she performed so poorly against these kids they both evidently had the energy to immediately fight each other for almost an entire 24 hours because Kaguya clearly couldn't even tire them out the entire time she fought them.\n\n\n\n>He is one pearson and he has both of Naruto's and Sasuke's Main powers(Tailed beast/Sage Mode and EMS/Rinnegan). In both cases better than theirs.\n\nCompletely irrelevant, and absolutely *nothing* proves or suggests he was better than them with their own powers. What he was to them was *stronger* than them individually. That's it.\n\n>Clones might be a problem, tho Madara knows Shinra Tensei and other large scale attacks. He also should have Xhakra at least comparable to Naruto, and spam wood clones.\n\nNothing in his arsenal will be enough to stop his clones. Not when Naruto can simply make more.\n\n>Would need to gather nature energy first, it would take some time.\n\nWhich would be easy. Madara's too focused on everything and everyone else in the battle to care about what that 1 clone is doing. He wouldn't even notice a clone leaving, let alone stopping it from doing what it's gonna do. He'd need to get past Naruto first for that.\n\n\n>Sasuke isn't really a problem here. He doesn't scale to Naruto, so he doesn't have any feats to put him on level of upper Six Paths characters.\n\nHe's literally directly comparable to Naruto. It's hard to take you seriously when you repeatedly say shit like this bro. No he isn't stronger than Naruto, but he's still in the same tier as him and directly comparable *to* him.\n\n>It's also worth noting, that all Madara needs to do is killing Sasuke. After that, he can use Mugen Tsukiyome and it's GG.\n\nHe's not gonna kill Sasuke. Sasuke's hax makes up for what power he lacks, that's always been common knowledge.",

Sure, he would not fall again for that genjutsu Itachi used on him back when both were in Akatsuki. But now we are talking about Six paths chakra Sasuke. What do you expect Orochimaru to do?\n\nEdit: hell. I even expect him to fall for a standard Tsukiyomi",

If Amado can make cyborgs that easily rival Gigen who destroyed pre-nerf Naruto and Sasuke, then I see no reason why orochimaru who has way more knowledge in chakra and Ninjutsu and created someone like Mitsuki with sage mode imbedded since birth, cannot do something similar, let alone something basic like genjutsu immunity that all Kara members have btw. We have no idea what he did in the many years between shippuden.",

So in terms of results, a lot of people have been spared, Kakashi didn't die, there's enough time to evacuate the village so even if Tendo Pain goes high up and nukes the village, there would be nearly no casualties. In reality, there were a lot of dead and casualties, Tsunade tried to cover her mistake by healing the injured but if it wasn't for Naruto of for talk no jutsu, the results would be catastrophic. \n\nNow regarding Tendo Pain, like I said Jiraiya had plenty of assets, just to name a few:\n\n- He summons his toad cage to imprison the path, shinra tensei may have an effect but still hindered\n\n- He attaches himself to Pain with his hair technique to keep the same distance despite shinra tensei, not to forget the toad grandparents also attached to Jiraiya\n\n- He has very long distance attacks such has fire jutsu empowered by toad oil, the reason Naruto struggled so much was because he only had rasengan as attack and his only long distance one was rasenshuriken which he couldn't control its trajectory. The only solution Naruto had was spam clones and force Pain to spam shinra tensei then make profit of the cooldown, Jiraiya can counter it way more easily with long distance attacks\n\nTell me how this is wrong",

Jiraiya is a veteran legend who has plenty of assets and could deal with the main Pain in several ways.

The hokage post implies fighting for the village, defending it, be willing to sacrifice themselves for the others. As you told this might be stupid idea egoistically  speaking, but that only proves she's egoistical just like the corrupted politicians who create suffering for their own profit like sending people to unnecessary wars or like Tsunade deploying every ninja as canon fodder so that Pain doesn't reach the hokage office.

He literally tosses Pa toad into Naruto's arms to keep him from countering as he almighty pulls him into a choke slam. If he hadn't endangered them, Naruto would've simply went Sage Mode again using the last clone he had left and bodied him, that's painfully evident, especially since that's what he ends up doing anyway after his 9-tails rampage.\"*\n\n*\"I find it pretty weird people always seem to conveniently forget certain details in order to discredit Naruto.\"*\n\nThere seriously is this really, really weird thing people like to do where they like to treat Naruto and Kurama as if they're separate powers. They're not. Jinchuriki aren't separate from their tailed beast, and that's just the simple reality of the situation. If they are, then tell Sasuke to put his eyes back in Itachi's sockets in the grave. Tell Madara to return every amp he ever took or stole back where he got it from. Tell Killer Bee he isn't even worth a pile of shit without his 8 tails always \"helping\" him like it did against Taka Sasuke and Kisame, and Gaara and the other Jinchuriki as well. Tell Obito it was really the ten tails doing all the work in his unstable condition and he had absolutely no part in it. \n\nYou see how far that gets you? About as far as I can throw you.\n\nAnother thing, which is really just icing on the cake honestly, Pain knew *exactly* what he was getting himself into fighting a Jinchuriki. Just like when he fought the other Jinchuriki. Naruto just happened to be the only Jinchuriki who didn't need to use his tailed beast to whoop his ass. Pain knew the risks, he just lost. It's quite literally that simple.\n\nEven Minato \"helped\" Naruto here more than the 9-tails did. I don't know who never told any of you this, but Kurama was never helping Naruto. He took over and intended to just kill everyone and everything. When he broke out of the chibaku tensei, *Kurama* was the one who broke out of it. It was literally Minato that fixed Naruto's seal and have him return normal again. \n\nKurama did nothing to Pain that made him any weaker after their brief scuffle. Only person truly affected by it was Nagato. Pain was perfectly fine, and was in the same condition after the fight with 6-tails Naruto that he was in before it. Pain simply was a dead person being used as a vessel to fight. He doesn't have stamina. He doesn't feel pain. He doesn't have chakra reserves. He can spam as many rinnegan abilities as he'd like and there wouldn't be any consequences of it except a weak ass cooldown timer. But let's just ignore that, right?\n\nIt's hilarious how much random shit people chalk up to Kurama honestly.",

He had expended a lot, but it had no noticeable affects on his ability to control Pain. His movements and reactions were still the same speed. He was still able to use almighty push and universal pull to the same extent, there wasn't even an extended cooldown where he couldn't use his powers anymore, like there was when he destroyed the village. The Diva Path of Pain was essentially completely unaffected from that fight. It's a corpse being manipulated and as long as Nagato still has the chakra to control it (which he did, he had plenty) it won't go down or get weaker.\n\nAs for the Minato thing, the guy isn't saying that Minato directly helped Naruto defeat Pain in the same physical way Kurama did. He's saying Kurama wasn't helping Naruto, at least not intentionally. Kurama was just destroying everything for the sake of destroying everything. Pain happened to be the closest thing around, so Kurama did its best to kill him. After the 7 tail or so, Naruto was no longer even remotely in control. Minato helped him by rebuilding the seal, and giving Naruto another chance to take down Pain without succumbing to the 9 tails, which would've effectively killed him.",

You are right about one thing though, it's true that Naruto couldn't have won if Kurama hadn't broken out of the chibaku tensei. However, no one was saying otherwise or at least I wasn't. What *I* was saying is that Pain was effectively uninhibited by the fight with Kurama. Now the keyword there is \"effectively,\" if you can understand the meaning of the word in this context. Narratively speaking yes, Nagato was affected greatly by the immense amount of chakra he had to use to fight Kurama. However immediately after the fact, when Naruto is in control again, he goes right back to spamming Almighty Push and Universal Pull to the exact same effect. His movement and reaction speed hasn't decreased at all, he didn't have a longer cooldown on Almighty Push, Almighty Push isn't noticeably weaker, and the corpse that Pain was made of hadn't suffered any grievous wounds. And none of this is speculation, it's visibly demonstrable. You can quite literally look at that chapter of the manga and see that what I'm saying is true, and the anime is no different.",

If someone's gotta resort to dirty tactics to gain the upper hand on their opponent that alone should tell you how the fight would go between them, pretty much exactly like how it ended up going anyway. Delta only resorted to using Naruto's kids as bait because she felt she wasn't getting anywhere currently and that's pretty much the same exact situation Pain was in against Sage Mode Naruto.",

But hey, good job moving the goalposts in a desperate but futile attempt to salvage some shred of dignity as you fall deeper into the pit of ignorance and insignificance. Your foolish tenacity has been acknowledged. But this is a battle that you shall lose all the same, because if the argument is that Naruto couldn't have won without Kurama, then the solution for me is even simpler than before. Naruto not only could've won without Kurama, but absolutely would have if it weren't for Ma and Pa. Their presence was a hindrance more than it was a help. Pa attempted to use the same genjutsu on Pain that they'd used with Jiraiya when they first fought Pain, which immediately prompted him to kill Pa. Naruto's attempt to save them is what got him caught and things went downhill from there. If they simply hadn't been present, or otherwise hadn't been attacked, Naruto would've won by himself in the exact same way he ultimately did anyways. The only difference is that it would've been without Kurama's intervention.",

I'm the troll? Interesting. I do believe I made it quite clear that I don't care about the discussion earlier. I hardly considered it an argument, let alone a matter of winning or losing. It's an anime and I don't put genuine effort or emotional investment into discussions about fictional characters or settings. However, I did raise actual points. I made sound arguments backed by evidence. You on the other hand quite literally just kept repeating yourself again and again,. \"Lma0\" this, \"actually\" that, and you never once explained your reasoning or gave any sort of evidence as to your point. Clearly you care about winning far more than I do, since you're still prattling on about it, whereas I had already moved on and attempted to end the discussion quite concisely. So unless the meaning of the word has changed in the last hour or so, I don't believe I'm the troll here. But once again, I extend to you permission to believe whatever you so desire. I don't care. And feel free to continue proving my point; you are a slave to your most toxic habits. You're still here because you're unable to stop. You simply must have the last word. You can't help it.

They were gonna go clean through him like they did Momoshiki when they were older lmao. He couldn't land anything on them, he couldn't do anything. All he did was level up and block shit. Somehow that translated into \"lOl hEs rEaLlY oP nOw\" to these Madara fanboys even though he didn't even do anything.\n\nEdit: About Limbo, people overexaggerate how OP it is. It's definitely OP against people who either can't see it or sense it, but Naruto and Sasuke could both sense or see them. In the anime, Naruto decides to make 1 shadow clone per limbo clone when he could've just dumped 20 on them to overwhelm them and keep them busy as he and Sasuke went after the real Madara.\n\nThe Limbo clones are literally no different than regular clones when everyone in the battle can also see them. Only difference is they don't poof after taking too much damage. We actually don't even know what happens to them if they take too much damage.",

And Rinne Sharingan is stronger than Rinnegan, so he should scale above Naruto and Sasuke at this point. Not to mention fact that he is more versitile.\n\nI understand the thought process, but no. He never once proved to be above them. All of his buffs absolutely pale in compairson to Kaguya and her power, and again, we saw how well Naruto was handling himself against her. He was doing *more* than just \"handling\" himself. He was actually soloing her by himself. \n\nThe point is Juubidara pales in comparison to her, and even Kaguya herself wasn't enough to completely overwhelm them. Naruto and Sasuke with their six paths powers during the war were far more powerful than anyone gave them credit for. And Madara wasn't more versatile than they were. It's funny, because as much as people were saying Juubidara was holding back/hiding power, so were Naruto and Sasuke. Naruto only made 4 clones to fight the Limbo clones instead of making like 10 or 500, and he never used boil release on him yet. And just like how his Limbo clones could use Susanoo, Naruto's shadow clones can all manifest the Kurama avatar. He could also literally use 3 headed Kurama at any given moment as well. Could also probably give Sasuke some bijuu chakra to amp his Susanoo like Sasuke did in their fight against each other.\n\n>You never showed scan of them being able to even touch him after getting Six Paths Power.\n\nThat's never been the discussion. We're talking about the misconception Madara was \"above\" them, despite his feats heavily suggesting otherwise.",

When he matched her power on *numerous* occasions. How he was controlling the battle against her with his shadow clones. \n\nIt doesn't matter if she was serious or not, not when even when she did decide to get serious and try to kill Naruto and Sasuke, she was still utterly incapable of doing it.\n\n>But she wasn't serious, and wanted his Chakra. Few moments later she litteraly slaps him.\n\n\nLmao, \"slaps\". All you seem to be able to do is turn an ant-hill into a mountain. She pushed him back and poofed clones. She never once landed any real attacks on him, nor was she able to damage either of these kids to any significant degree the *entire* battle. In fact, she performed so poorly against these kids they both evidently had the energy to immediately fight each other for almost an entire 24 hours because Kaguya clearly couldn't even tire them out the entire time she fought them.\n\n\n\n>He is one pearson and he has both of Naruto's and Sasuke's Main powers(Tailed beast/Sage Mode and EMS/Rinnegan). In both cases better than theirs.\n\nCompletely irrelevant, and absolutely *nothing* proves or suggests he was better than them with their own powers. What he was to them was *stronger* than them individually. That's it.\n\n>Clones might be a problem, tho Madara knows Shinra Tensei and other large scale attacks. He also should have Xhakra at least comparable to Naruto, and spam wood clones.\n\nNothing in his arsenal will be enough to stop his clones. Not when Naruto can simply make more.\n\n>Would need to gather nature energy first, it would take some time.\n\nWhich would be easy. Madara's too focused on everything and everyone else in the battle to care about what that 1 clone is doing. He wouldn't even notice a clone leaving, let alone stopping it from doing what it's gonna do. He'd need to get past Naruto first for that.\n\n\n>Sasuke isn't really a problem here. He doesn't scale to Naruto, so he doesn't have any feats to put him on level of upper Six Paths characters.\n\nHe's literally directly comparable to Naruto. It's hard to take you seriously when you repeatedly say shit like this bro. No he isn't stronger than Naruto, but he's still in the same tier as him and directly comparable *to* him.\n\n>It's also worth noting, that all Madara needs to do is killing Sasuke. After that, he can use Mugen Tsukiyome and it's GG.\n\nHe's not gonna kill Sasuke. Sasuke's hax makes up for what power he lacks, that's always been common knowledge.",

So in terms of results, a lot of people have been spared, Kakashi didn't die, there's enough time to evacuate the village so even if Tendo Pain goes high up and nukes the village, there would be nearly no casualties. In reality, there were a lot of dead and casualties, Tsunade tried to cover her mistake by healing the injured but if it wasn't for Naruto of for talk no jutsu, the results would be catastrophic. \n\nNow regarding Tendo Pain, like I said Jiraiya had plenty of assets, just to name a few:\n\n- He summons his toad cage to imprison the path, shinra tensei may have an effect but still hindered\n\n- He attaches himself to Pain with his hair technique to keep the same distance despite shinra tensei, not to forget the toad grandparents also attached to Jiraiya\n\n- He has very long distance attacks such has fire jutsu empowered by toad oil, the reason Naruto struggled so much was because he only had rasengan as attack and his only long distance one was rasenshuriken which he couldn't control its trajectory. The only solution Naruto had was spam clones and force Pain to spam shinra tensei then make profit of the cooldown, Jiraiya can counter it way more easily with long distance attacks\n\nTell me how this is wrong",

The reason Naruto lost to main Pain was because he's just raw power type of ninja, spams rasengans with a few tricks in his sleeves but that's it. Jiraiya is a veteran legend who has plenty of assets and could deal with the main Pain in several ways. If he was in Konoha he'd safely gather the intel, casually have all the anbu and ninjas at his service, so he wouldn't be overwhelmed by the time he knows how to deal with Pain",

Grow up a bit, would you?",

So she can die and leave the village under no leadership again?\n\nJiraiya died, accept it and move, even Naruto has.",

She sent those ninjas to DIE to Pain and BUY TIME while waiting for Naruto because Naruto was the real hokage doing her job. A lot of civilians abd ninjas like Kakashi died because she didn't do anything, healing the minor casualties won't change that fact, there were plenty of dead. If Naruto was late, the whole village and everyone would be killed, then Pain would move because seeing Naruto isn't nearby, and bye bye plot convenience reviving everyone.\n\nYou still couldn't state a single good action she did during her mandate, which proves my point that you're most likely deluded 13 y.o. fangirl",

He had expended a lot, but it had no noticeable affects on his ability to control Pain. His movements and reactions were still the same speed. He was still able to use almighty push and universal pull to the same extent, there wasn't even an extended cooldown where he couldn't use his powers anymore, like there was when he destroyed the village. The Diva Path of Pain was essentially completely unaffected from that fight. It's a corpse being manipulated and as long as Nagato still has the chakra to control it (which he did, he had plenty) it won't go down or get weaker.\n\nAs for the Minato thing, the guy isn't saying that Minato directly helped Naruto defeat Pain in the same physical way Kurama did. He's saying Kurama wasn't helping Naruto, at least not intentionally. Kurama was just destroying everything for the sake of destroying everything. Pain happened to be the closest thing around, so Kurama did its best to kill him. After the 7 tail or so, Naruto was no longer even remotely in control. Minato helped him by rebuilding the seal, and giving Naruto another chance to take down Pain without succumbing to the 9 tails, which would've effectively killed him.",

You are right about one thing though, it's true that Naruto couldn't have won if Kurama hadn't broken out of the chibaku tensei. However, no one was saying otherwise or at least I wasn't. What *I* was saying is that Pain was effectively uninhibited by the fight with Kurama. Now the keyword there is \"effectively,\" if you can understand the meaning of the word in this context. Narratively speaking yes, Nagato was affected greatly by the immense amount of chakra he had to use to fight Kurama. However immediately after the fact, when Naruto is in control again, he goes right back to spamming Almighty Push and Universal Pull to the exact same effect. His movement and reaction speed hasn't decreased at all, he didn't have a longer cooldown on Almighty Push, Almighty Push isn't noticeably weaker, and the corpse that Pain was made of hadn't suffered any grievous wounds. And none of this is speculation, it's visibly demonstrable. You can quite literally look at that chapter of the manga and see that what I'm saying is true, and the anime is no different.",

If someone's gotta resort to dirty tactics to gain the upper hand on their opponent that alone should tell you how the fight would go between them, pretty much exactly like how it ended up going anyway. Delta only resorted to using Naruto's kids as bait because she felt she wasn't getting anywhere currently and that's pretty much the same exact situation Pain was in against Sage Mode Naruto.",

Who was doing 95% of the talking as Naruto was pinned by the rods, and relating to the other telling them how they were sibling students? Nagato and Konan would have been killed literally on sight if it weren't for that connection between them.",

But hey, good job moving the goalposts in a desperate but futile attempt to salvage some shred of dignity as you fall deeper into the pit of ignorance and insignificance. Your foolish tenacity has been acknowledged. But this is a battle that you shall lose all the same, because if the argument is that Naruto couldn't have won without Kurama, then the solution for me is even simpler than before. Naruto not only could've won without Kurama, but absolutely would have if it weren't for Ma and Pa. Their presence was a hindrance more than it was a help. Pa attempted to use the same genjutsu on Pain that they'd used with Jiraiya when they first fought Pain, which immediately prompted him to kill Pa. Naruto's attempt to save them is what got him caught and things went downhill from there. If they simply hadn't been present, or otherwise hadn't been attacked, Naruto would've won by himself in the exact same way he ultimately did anyways. The only difference is that it would've been without Kurama's intervention.",

I'm the troll? Interesting. I do believe I made it quite clear that I don't care about the discussion earlier. I hardly considered it an argument, let alone a matter of winning or losing. It's an anime and I don't put genuine effort or emotional investment into discussions about fictional characters or settings. However, I did raise actual points. I made sound arguments backed by evidence. You on the other hand quite literally just kept repeating yourself again and again,. \"Lma0\" this, \"actually\" that, and you never once explained your reasoning or gave any sort of evidence as to your point. Clearly you care about winning far more than I do, since you're still prattling on about it, whereas I had already moved on and attempted to end the discussion quite concisely. So unless the meaning of the word has changed in the last hour or so, I don't believe I'm the troll here. But once again, I extend to you permission to believe whatever you so desire. I don't care. And feel free to continue proving my point; you are a slave to your most toxic habits. You're still here because you're unable to stop. You simply must have the last word. You can't help it.

They were gonna go clean through him like they did Momoshiki when they were older lmao. He couldn't land anything on them, he couldn't do anything. All he did was level up and block shit. Somehow that translated into \"lOl hEs rEaLlY oP nOw\" to these Madara fanboys even though he didn't even do anything.\n\nEdit: About Limbo, people overexaggerate how OP it is. It's definitely OP against people who either can't see it or sense it, but Naruto and Sasuke could both sense or see them. In the anime, Naruto decides to make 1 shadow clone per limbo clone when he could've just dumped 20 on them to overwhelm them and keep them busy as he and Sasuke went after the real Madara.\n\nThe Limbo clones are literally no different than regular clones when everyone in the battle can also see them. Only difference is they don't poof after taking too much damage. We actually don't even know what happens to them if they take too much damage.",

All his powerup did was make him go from getting speed blitzed by Naruto and Sasuke and slapped by massive lavastyle rasenshuriken instantly like he was previously doing, to being able to actually fight them now, especially with the Limbo clones to assist.\n\nYour inability to show a scan of him actually having any kind of upper hand against them after his massive buff already proves my point. You resort to overexaggerating simple feats like blocks or trying to use his entrance as some kind of \"proof\" when literally none of that helps support your argument even in the slightest. You're just grasping at straws, grasping at anything to keep deluding yourself he was somehow \"above\" them.",

And Rinne Sharingan is stronger than Rinnegan, so he should scale above Naruto and Sasuke at this point. Not to mention fact that he is more versitile.\n\nI understand the thought process, but no. He never once proved to be above them. All of his buffs absolutely pale in compairson to Kaguya and her power, and again, we saw how well Naruto was handling himself against her. He was doing *more* than just \"handling\" himself. He was actually soloing her by himself. \n\nThe point is Juubidara pales in comparison to her, and even Kaguya herself wasn't enough to completely overwhelm them. Naruto and Sasuke with their six paths powers during the war were far more powerful than anyone gave them credit for. And Madara wasn't more versatile than they were. It's funny, because as much as people were saying Juubidara was holding back/hiding power, so were Naruto and Sasuke. Naruto only made 4 clones to fight the Limbo clones instead of making like 10 or 500, and he never used boil release on him yet. And just like how his Limbo clones could use Susanoo, Naruto's shadow clones can all manifest the Kurama avatar. He could also literally use 3 headed Kurama at any given moment as well. Could also probably give Sasuke some bijuu chakra to amp his Susanoo like Sasuke did in their fight against each other.\n\n>You never showed scan of them being able to even touch him after getting Six Paths Power.\n\nThat's never been the discussion. We're talking about the misconception Madara was \"above\" them, despite his feats heavily suggesting otherwise.",

Once in Sexy Jutsu, once when he used boil release and clones.\n\nNo, he did far more than that. Like when he speed blitzed her. Slapped her with 9 rasenshuriken. When he matched her power on *numerous* occasions. How he was controlling the battle against her with his shadow clones. \n\nIt doesn't matter if she was serious or not, not when even when she did decide to get serious and try to kill Naruto and Sasuke, she was still utterly incapable of doing it.\n\n>But she wasn't serious, and wanted his Chakra. Few moments later she litteraly slaps him.\n\n\nLmao, \"slaps\". All you seem to be able to do is turn an ant-hill into a mountain. She pushed him back and poofed clones. She never once landed any real attacks on him, nor was she able to damage either of these kids to any significant degree the *entire* battle. In fact, she performed so poorly against these kids they both evidently had the energy to immediately fight each other for almost an entire 24 hours because Kaguya clearly couldn't even tire them out the entire time she fought them.\n\n\n\n>He is one pearson and he has both of Naruto's and Sasuke's Main powers(Tailed beast/Sage Mode and EMS/Rinnegan). In both cases better than theirs.\n\nCompletely irrelevant, and absolutely *nothing* proves or suggests he was better than them with their own powers. What he was to them was *stronger* than them individually. That's it.\n\n>Clones might be a problem, tho Madara knows Shinra Tensei and other large scale attacks. He also should have Xhakra at least comparable to Naruto, and spam wood clones.\n\nNothing in his arsenal will be enough to stop his clones. Not when Naruto can simply make more.\n\n>Would need to gather nature energy first, it would take some time.\n\nWhich would be easy. Madara's too focused on everything and everyone else in the battle to care about what that 1 clone is doing. He wouldn't even notice a clone leaving, let alone stopping it from doing what it's gonna do. He'd need to get past Naruto first for that.\n\n\n>Sasuke isn't really a problem here. He doesn't scale to Naruto, so he doesn't have any feats to put him on level of upper Six Paths characters.\n\nHe's literally directly comparable to Naruto. It's hard to take you seriously when you repeatedly say shit like this bro. No he isn't stronger than Naruto, but he's still in the same tier as him and directly comparable *to* him.\n\n>It's also worth noting, that all Madara needs to do is killing Sasuke. After that, he can use Mugen Tsukiyome and it's GG.\n\nHe's not gonna kill Sasuke. Sasuke's hax makes up for what power he lacks, that's always been common knowledge.",

So in terms of results, a lot of people have been spared, Kakashi didn't die, there's enough time to evacuate the village so even if Tendo Pain goes high up and nukes the village, there would be nearly no casualties. In reality, there were a lot of dead and casualties, Tsunade tried to cover her mistake by healing the injured but if it wasn't for Naruto of for talk no jutsu, the results would be catastrophic. \n\nNow regarding Tendo Pain, like I said Jiraiya had plenty of assets, just to name a few:\n\n- He summons his toad cage to imprison the path, shinra tensei may have an effect but still hindered\n\n- He attaches himself to Pain with his hair technique to keep the same distance despite shinra tensei, not to forget the toad grandparents also attached to Jiraiya\n\n- He has very long distance attacks such has fire jutsu empowered by toad oil, the reason Naruto struggled so much was because he only had rasengan as attack and his only long distance one was rasenshuriken which he couldn't control its trajectory. The only solution Naruto had was spam clones and force Pain to spam shinra tensei then make profit of the cooldown, Jiraiya can counter it way more easily with long distance attacks\n\nTell me how this is wrong",

He had expended a lot, but it had no noticeable affects on his ability to control Pain. His movements and reactions were still the same speed. He was still able to use almighty push and universal pull to the same extent, there wasn't even an extended cooldown where he couldn't use his powers anymore, like there was when he destroyed the village. The Diva Path of Pain was essentially completely unaffected from that fight. It's a corpse being manipulated and as long as Nagato still has the chakra to control it (which he did, he had plenty) it won't go down or get weaker.\n\nAs for the Minato thing, the guy isn't saying that Minato directly helped Naruto defeat Pain in the same physical way Kurama did. He's saying Kurama wasn't helping Naruto, at least not intentionally. Kurama was just destroying everything for the sake of destroying everything. Pain happened to be the closest thing around, so Kurama did its best to kill him. After the 7 tail or so, Naruto was no longer even remotely in control. Minato helped him by rebuilding the seal, and giving Naruto another chance to take down Pain without succumbing to the 9 tails, which would've effectively killed him.",

But my god, every time you say something I can feel my brain cells shrieking in agony before committing mass suicide. You are right about one thing though, it's true that Naruto couldn't have won if Kurama hadn't broken out of the chibaku tensei. However, no one was saying otherwise or at least I wasn't. What *I* was saying is that Pain was effectively uninhibited by the fight with Kurama. Now the keyword there is \"effectively,\" if you can understand the meaning of the word in this context. Narratively speaking yes, Nagato was affected greatly by the immense amount of chakra he had to use to fight Kurama. However immediately after the fact, when Naruto is in control again, he goes right back to spamming Almighty Push and Universal Pull to the exact same effect. His movement and reaction speed hasn't decreased at all, he didn't have a longer cooldown on Almighty Push, Almighty Push isn't noticeably weaker, and the corpse that Pain was made of hadn't suffered any grievous wounds. And none of this is speculation, it's visibly demonstrable. You can quite literally look at that chapter of the manga and see that what I'm saying is true, and the anime is no different.",

If someone's gotta resort to dirty tactics to gain the upper hand on their opponent that alone should tell you how the fight would go between them, pretty much exactly like how it ended up going anyway. Delta only resorted to using Naruto's kids as bait because she felt she wasn't getting anywhere currently and that's pretty much the same exact situation Pain was in against Sage Mode Naruto.",

Your foolish tenacity has been acknowledged. But this is a battle that you shall lose all the same, because if the argument is that Naruto couldn't have won without Kurama, then the solution for me is even simpler than before. Naruto not only could've won without Kurama, but absolutely would have if it weren't for Ma and Pa. Their presence was a hindrance more than it was a help. Pa attempted to use the same genjutsu on Pain that they'd used with Jiraiya when they first fought Pain, which immediately prompted him to kill Pa. Naruto's attempt to save them is what got him caught and things went downhill from there. If they simply hadn't been present, or otherwise hadn't been attacked, Naruto would've won by himself in the exact same way he ultimately did anyways. The only difference is that it would've been without Kurama's intervention.",

I'm the troll? Interesting. I do believe I made it quite clear that I don't care about the discussion earlier. I hardly considered it an argument, let alone a matter of winning or losing. It's an anime and I don't put genuine effort or emotional investment into discussions about fictional characters or settings. However, I did raise actual points. I made sound arguments backed by evidence. You on the other hand quite literally just kept repeating yourself again and again,. \"Lma0\" this, \"actually\" that, and you never once explained your reasoning or gave any sort of evidence as to your point. Clearly you care about winning far more than I do, since you're still prattling on about it, whereas I had already moved on and attempted to end the discussion quite concisely. So unless the meaning of the word has changed in the last hour or so, I don't believe I'm the troll here. But once again, I extend to you permission to believe whatever you so desire. I don't care. And feel free to continue proving my point; you are a slave to your most toxic habits. You're still here because you're unable to stop. You simply must have the last word. You can't help it.

And Rinne Sharingan is stronger than Rinnegan, so he should scale above Naruto and Sasuke at this point. Not to mention fact that he is more versitile.\n\nI understand the thought process, but no. He never once proved to be above them. All of his buffs absolutely pale in compairson to Kaguya and her power, and again, we saw how well Naruto was handling himself against her. He was doing *more* than just \"handling\" himself. He was actually soloing her by himself. \n\nThe point is Juubidara pales in comparison to her, and even Kaguya herself wasn't enough to completely overwhelm them. Naruto and Sasuke with their six paths powers during the war were far more powerful than anyone gave them credit for. And Madara wasn't more versatile than they were. It's funny, because as much as people were saying Juubidara was holding back/hiding power, so were Naruto and Sasuke. Naruto only made 4 clones to fight the Limbo clones instead of making like 10 or 500, and he never used boil release on him yet. And just like how his Limbo clones could use Susanoo, Naruto's shadow clones can all manifest the Kurama avatar. He could also literally use 3 headed Kurama at any given moment as well. Could also probably give Sasuke some bijuu chakra to amp his Susanoo like Sasuke did in their fight against each other.\n\n>You never showed scan of them being able to even touch him after getting Six Paths Power.\n\nThat's never been the discussion. We're talking about the misconception Madara was \"above\" them, despite his feats heavily suggesting otherwise.",

Once in Sexy Jutsu, once when he used boil release and clones.\n\nNo, he did far more than that. Like when he speed blitzed her. Slapped her with 9 rasenshuriken. When he matched her power on *numerous* occasions. How he was controlling the battle against her with his shadow clones. \n\nIt doesn't matter if she was serious or not, not when even when she did decide to get serious and try to kill Naruto and Sasuke, she was still utterly incapable of doing it.\n\n>But she wasn't serious, and wanted his Chakra. Few moments later she litteraly slaps him.\n\n\nLmao, \"slaps\". All you seem to be able to do is turn an ant-hill into a mountain. She pushed him back and poofed clones. She never once landed any real attacks on him, nor was she able to damage either of these kids to any significant degree the *entire* battle. In fact, she performed so poorly against these kids they both evidently had the energy to immediately fight each other for almost an entire 24 hours because Kaguya clearly couldn't even tire them out the entire time she fought them.\n\n\n\n>He is one pearson and he has both of Naruto's and Sasuke's Main powers(Tailed beast/Sage Mode and EMS/Rinnegan). In both cases better than theirs.\n\nCompletely irrelevant, and absolutely *nothing* proves or suggests he was better than them with their own powers. What he was to them was *stronger* than them individually. That's it.\n\n>Clones might be a problem, tho Madara knows Shinra Tensei and other large scale attacks. He also should have Xhakra at least comparable to Naruto, and spam wood clones.\n\nNothing in his arsenal will be enough to stop his clones. Not when Naruto can simply make more.\n\n>Would need to gather nature energy first, it would take some time.\n\nWhich would be easy. Madara's too focused on everything and everyone else in the battle to care about what that 1 clone is doing. He wouldn't even notice a clone leaving, let alone stopping it from doing what it's gonna do. He'd need to get past Naruto first for that.\n\n\n>Sasuke isn't really a problem here. He doesn't scale to Naruto, so he doesn't have any feats to put him on level of upper Six Paths characters.\n\nHe's literally directly comparable to Naruto. It's hard to take you seriously when you repeatedly say shit like this bro. No he isn't stronger than Naruto, but he's still in the same tier as him and directly comparable *to* him.\n\n>It's also worth noting, that all Madara needs to do is killing Sasuke. After that, he can use Mugen Tsukiyome and it's GG.\n\nHe's not gonna kill Sasuke. Sasuke's hax makes up for what power he lacks, that's always been common knowledge.",

So in terms of results, a lot of people have been spared, Kakashi didn't die, there's enough time to evacuate the village so even if Tendo Pain goes high up and nukes the village, there would be nearly no casualties. In reality, there were a lot of dead and casualties, Tsunade tried to cover her mistake by healing the injured but if it wasn't for Naruto of for talk no jutsu, the results would be catastrophic. \n\nNow regarding Tendo Pain, like I said Jiraiya had plenty of assets, just to name a few:\n\n- He summons his toad cage to imprison the path, shinra tensei may have an effect but still hindered\n\n- He attaches himself to Pain with his hair technique to keep the same distance despite shinra tensei, not to forget the toad grandparents also attached to Jiraiya\n\n- He has very long distance attacks such has fire jutsu empowered by toad oil, the reason Naruto struggled so much was because he only had rasengan as attack and his only long distance one was rasenshuriken which he couldn't control its trajectory. The only solution Naruto had was spam clones and force Pain to spam shinra tensei then make profit of the cooldown, Jiraiya can counter it way more easily with long distance attacks\n\nTell me how this is wrong",

What *I* was saying is that Pain was effectively uninhibited by the fight with Kurama. Now the keyword there is \"effectively,\" if you can understand the meaning of the word in this context. Narratively speaking yes, Nagato was affected greatly by the immense amount of chakra he had to use to fight Kurama. However immediately after the fact, when Naruto is in control again, he goes right back to spamming Almighty Push and Universal Pull to the exact same effect. His movement and reaction speed hasn't decreased at all, he didn't have a longer cooldown on Almighty Push, Almighty Push isn't noticeably weaker, and the corpse that Pain was made of hadn't suffered any grievous wounds. And none of this is speculation, it's visibly demonstrable. You can quite literally look at that chapter of the manga and see that what I'm saying is true, and the anime is no different.",

If someone's gotta resort to dirty tactics to gain the upper hand on their opponent that alone should tell you how the fight would go between them, pretty much exactly like how it ended up going anyway.

But hey, good job moving the goalposts in a desperate but futile attempt to salvage some shred of dignity as you fall deeper into the pit of ignorance and insignificance. Your foolish tenacity has been acknowledged. But this is a battle that you shall lose all the same, because if the argument is that Naruto couldn't have won without Kurama, then the solution for me is even simpler than before. Naruto not only could've won without Kurama, but absolutely would have if it weren't for Ma and Pa. Their presence was a hindrance more than it was a help. Pa attempted to use the same genjutsu on Pain that they'd used with Jiraiya when they first fought Pain, which immediately prompted him to kill Pa. Naruto's attempt to save them is what got him caught and things went downhill from there. If they simply hadn't been present, or otherwise hadn't been attacked, Naruto would've won by himself in the exact same way he ultimately did anyways. The only difference is that it would've been without Kurama's intervention.",

I'm the troll? Interesting. I do believe I made it quite clear that I don't care about the discussion earlier. I hardly considered it an argument, let alone a matter of winning or losing. It's an anime and I don't put genuine effort or emotional investment into discussions about fictional characters or settings. However, I did raise actual points. I made sound arguments backed by evidence. You on the other hand quite literally just kept repeating yourself again and again,. \"Lma0\" this, \"actually\" that, and you never once explained your reasoning or gave any sort of evidence as to your point. Clearly you care about winning far more than I do, since you're still prattling on about it, whereas I had already moved on and attempted to end the discussion quite concisely. So unless the meaning of the word has changed in the last hour or so, I don't believe I'm the troll here. But once again, I extend to you permission to believe whatever you so desire. I don't care. And feel free to continue proving my point; you are a slave to your most toxic habits. You're still here because you're unable to stop. You simply must have the last word. You can't help it.

And Rinne Sharingan is stronger than Rinnegan, so he should scale above Naruto and Sasuke at this point. Not to mention fact that he is more versitile.\n\nI understand the thought process, but no. He never once proved to be above them. All of his buffs absolutely pale in compairson to Kaguya and her power, and again, we saw how well Naruto was handling himself against her. He was doing *more* than just \"handling\" himself. He was actually soloing her by himself. \n\nThe point is Juubidara pales in comparison to her, and even Kaguya herself wasn't enough to completely overwhelm them. Naruto and Sasuke with their six paths powers during the war were far more powerful than anyone gave them credit for. And Madara wasn't more versatile than they were. It's funny, because as much as people were saying Juubidara was holding back/hiding power, so were Naruto and Sasuke. Naruto only made 4 clones to fight the Limbo clones instead of making like 10 or 500, and he never used boil release on him yet. And just like how his Limbo clones could use Susanoo, Naruto's shadow clones can all manifest the Kurama avatar. He could also literally use 3 headed Kurama at any given moment as well. Could also probably give Sasuke some bijuu chakra to amp his Susanoo like Sasuke did in their fight against each other.\n\n>You never showed scan of them being able to even touch him after getting Six Paths Power.\n\nThat's never been the discussion. We're talking about the misconception Madara was \"above\" them, despite his feats heavily suggesting otherwise.",

Once in Sexy Jutsu, once when he used boil release and clones.\n\nNo, he did far more than that. Like when he speed blitzed her. Slapped her with 9 rasenshuriken. When he matched her power on *numerous* occasions. How he was controlling the battle against her with his shadow clones. \n\nIt doesn't matter if she was serious or not, not when even when she did decide to get serious and try to kill Naruto and Sasuke, she was still utterly incapable of doing it.\n\n>But she wasn't serious, and wanted his Chakra. Few moments later she litteraly slaps him.\n\n\nLmao, \"slaps\". All you seem to be able to do is turn an ant-hill into a mountain. She pushed him back and poofed clones. She never once landed any real attacks on him, nor was she able to damage either of these kids to any significant degree the *entire* battle. In fact, she performed so poorly against these kids they both evidently had the energy to immediately fight each other for almost an entire 24 hours because Kaguya clearly couldn't even tire them out the entire time she fought them.\n\n\n\n>He is one pearson and he has both of Naruto's and Sasuke's Main powers(Tailed beast/Sage Mode and EMS/Rinnegan). In both cases better than theirs.\n\nCompletely irrelevant, and absolutely *nothing* proves or suggests he was better than them with their own powers. What he was to them was *stronger* than them individually. That's it.\n\n>Clones might be a problem, tho Madara knows Shinra Tensei and other large scale attacks. He also should have Xhakra at least comparable to Naruto, and spam wood clones.\n\nNothing in his arsenal will be enough to stop his clones. Not when Naruto can simply make more.\n\n>Would need to gather nature energy first, it would take some time.\n\nWhich would be easy. Madara's too focused on everything and everyone else in the battle to care about what that 1 clone is doing. He wouldn't even notice a clone leaving, let alone stopping it from doing what it's gonna do. He'd need to get past Naruto first for that.\n\n\n>Sasuke isn't really a problem here. He doesn't scale to Naruto, so he doesn't have any feats to put him on level of upper Six Paths characters.\n\nHe's literally directly comparable to Naruto. It's hard to take you seriously when you repeatedly say shit like this bro. No he isn't stronger than Naruto, but he's still in the same tier as him and directly comparable *to* him.\n\n>It's also worth noting, that all Madara needs to do is killing Sasuke. After that, he can use Mugen Tsukiyome and it's GG.\n\nHe's not gonna kill Sasuke. Sasuke's hax makes up for what power he lacks, that's always been common knowledge.",

So in terms of results, a lot of people have been spared, Kakashi didn't die, there's enough time to evacuate the village so even if Tendo Pain goes high up and nukes the village, there would be nearly no casualties. In reality, there were a lot of dead and casualties, Tsunade tried to cover her mistake by healing the injured but if it wasn't for Naruto of for talk no jutsu, the results would be catastrophic. \n\nNow regarding Tendo Pain, like I said Jiraiya had plenty of assets, just to name a few:\n\n- He summons his toad cage to imprison the path, shinra tensei may have an effect but still hindered\n\n- He attaches himself to Pain with his hair technique to keep the same distance despite shinra tensei, not to forget the toad grandparents also attached to Jiraiya\n\n- He has very long distance attacks such has fire jutsu empowered by toad oil, the reason Naruto struggled so much was because he only had rasengan as attack and his only long distance one was rasenshuriken which he couldn't control its trajectory. The only solution Naruto had was spam clones and force Pain to spam shinra tensei then make profit of the cooldown, Jiraiya can counter it way more easily with long distance attacks\n\nTell me how this is wrong",

You are right about one thing though, it's true that Naruto couldn't have won if Kurama hadn't broken out of the chibaku tensei. However, no one was saying otherwise or at least I wasn't. What *I* was saying is that Pain was effectively uninhibited by the fight with Kurama. Now the keyword there is \"effectively,\" if you can understand the meaning of the word in this context. Narratively speaking yes, Nagato was affected greatly by the immense amount of chakra he had to use to fight Kurama. However immediately after the fact, when Naruto is in control again, he goes right back to spamming Almighty Push and Universal Pull to the exact same effect. His movement and reaction speed hasn't decreased at all, he didn't have a longer cooldown on Almighty Push, Almighty Push isn't noticeably weaker, and the corpse that Pain was made of hadn't suffered any grievous wounds. And none of this is speculation, it's visibly demonstrable. You can quite literally look at that chapter of the manga and see that what I'm saying is true, and the anime is no different.",

If someone's gotta resort to dirty tactics to gain the upper hand on their opponent that alone should tell you how the fight would go between them, pretty much exactly like how it ended up going anyway. Delta only resorted to using Naruto's kids as bait because she felt she wasn't getting anywhere currently and that's pretty much the same exact situation Pain was in against Sage Mode Naruto.",

Your foolish tenacity has been acknowledged. But this is a battle that you shall lose all the same, because if the argument is that Naruto couldn't have won without Kurama, then the solution for me is even simpler than before. Naruto not only could've won without Kurama, but absolutely would have if it weren't for Ma and Pa. Their presence was a hindrance more than it was a help. Pa attempted to use the same genjutsu on Pain that they'd used with Jiraiya when they first fought Pain, which immediately prompted him to kill Pa. Naruto's attempt to save them is what got him caught and things went downhill from there. If they simply hadn't been present, or otherwise hadn't been attacked, Naruto would've won by himself in the exact same way he ultimately did anyways. The only difference is that it would've been without Kurama's intervention.",

I'm the troll? Interesting. I do believe I made it quite clear that I don't care about the discussion earlier. I hardly considered it an argument, let alone a matter of winning or losing. It's an anime and I don't put genuine effort or emotional investment into discussions about fictional characters or settings. However, I did raise actual points. I made sound arguments backed by evidence. You on the other hand quite literally just kept repeating yourself again and again,. \"Lma0\" this, \"actually\" that, and you never once explained your reasoning or gave any sort of evidence as to your point. Clearly you care about winning far more than I do, since you're still prattling on about it, whereas I had already moved on and attempted to end the discussion quite concisely. So unless the meaning of the word has changed in the last hour or so, I don't believe I'm the troll here. But once again, I extend to you permission to believe whatever you so desire. I don't care. And feel free to continue proving my point; you are a slave to your most toxic habits. You're still here because you're unable to stop. You simply must have the last word. You can't help it.

He never once proved to be above them. All of his buffs absolutely pale in compairson to Kaguya and her power, and again, we saw how well Naruto was handling himself against her. He was doing *more* than just \"handling\" himself. He was actually soloing her by himself. \n\nThe point is Juubidara pales in comparison to her, and even Kaguya herself wasn't enough to completely overwhelm them. Naruto and Sasuke with their six paths powers during the war were far more powerful than anyone gave them credit for. And Madara wasn't more versatile than they were. It's funny, because as much as people were saying Juubidara was holding back/hiding power, so were Naruto and Sasuke. Naruto only made 4 clones to fight the Limbo clones instead of making like 10 or 500, and he never used boil release on him yet. And just like how his Limbo clones could use Susanoo, Naruto's shadow clones can all manifest the Kurama avatar. He could also literally use 3 headed Kurama at any given moment as well. Could also probably give Sasuke some bijuu chakra to amp his Susanoo like Sasuke did in their fight against each other.\n\n>You never showed scan of them being able to even touch him after getting Six Paths Power.\n\nThat's never been the discussion. We're talking about the misconception Madara was \"above\" them, despite his feats heavily suggesting otherwise.",

Like when he speed blitzed her. Slapped her with 9 rasenshuriken. When he matched her power on *numerous* occasions. How he was controlling the battle against her with his shadow clones. \n\nIt doesn't matter if she was serious or not, not when even when she did decide to get serious and try to kill Naruto and Sasuke, she was still utterly incapable of doing it.\n\n>But she wasn't serious, and wanted his Chakra. Few moments later she litteraly slaps him.\n\n\nLmao, \"slaps\". All you seem to be able to do is turn an ant-hill into a mountain. She pushed him back and poofed clones. She never once landed any real attacks on him, nor was she able to damage either of these kids to any significant degree the *entire* battle. In fact, she performed so poorly against these kids they both evidently had the energy to immediately fight each other for almost an entire 24 hours because Kaguya clearly couldn't even tire them out the entire time she fought them.\n\n\n\n>He is one pearson and he has both of Naruto's and Sasuke's Main powers(Tailed beast/Sage Mode and EMS/Rinnegan). In both cases better than theirs.\n\nCompletely irrelevant, and absolutely *nothing* proves or suggests he was better than them with their own powers. What he was to them was *stronger* than them individually. That's it.\n\n>Clones might be a problem, tho Madara knows Shinra Tensei and other large scale attacks. He also should have Xhakra at least comparable to Naruto, and spam wood clones.\n\nNothing in his arsenal will be enough to stop his clones. Not when Naruto can simply make more.\n\n>Would need to gather nature energy first, it would take some time.\n\nWhich would be easy. Madara's too focused on everything and everyone else in the battle to care about what that 1 clone is doing. He wouldn't even notice a clone leaving, let alone stopping it from doing what it's gonna do. He'd need to get past Naruto first for that.\n\n\n>Sasuke isn't really a problem here. He doesn't scale to Naruto, so he doesn't have any feats to put him on level of upper Six Paths characters.\n\nHe's literally directly comparable to Naruto. It's hard to take you seriously when you repeatedly say shit like this bro. No he isn't stronger than Naruto, but he's still in the same tier as him and directly comparable *to* him.\n\n>It's also worth noting, that all Madara needs to do is killing Sasuke. After that, he can use Mugen Tsukiyome and it's GG.\n\nHe's not gonna kill Sasuke. Sasuke's hax makes up for what power he lacks, that's always been common knowledge.",

Your foolish tenacity has been acknowledged. But this is a battle that you shall lose all the same, because if the argument is that Naruto couldn't have won without Kurama, then the solution for me is even simpler than before. Naruto not only could've won without Kurama, but absolutely would have if it weren't for Ma and Pa. Their presence was a hindrance more than it was a help. Pa attempted to use the same genjutsu on Pain that they'd used with Jiraiya when they first fought Pain, which immediately prompted him to kill Pa. Naruto's attempt to save them is what got him caught and things went downhill from there. If they simply hadn't been present, or otherwise hadn't been attacked, Naruto would've won by himself in the exact same way he ultimately did anyways. The only difference is that it would've been without Kurama's intervention.",

Interesting. I do believe I made it quite clear that I don't care about the discussion earlier. I hardly considered it an argument, let alone a matter of winning or losing. It's an anime and I don't put genuine effort or emotional investment into discussions about fictional characters or settings. However, I did raise actual points. I made sound arguments backed by evidence. You on the other hand quite literally just kept repeating yourself again and again,. \"Lma0\" this, \"actually\" that, and you never once explained your reasoning or gave any sort of evidence as to your point. Clearly you care about winning far more than I do, since you're still prattling on about it, whereas I had already moved on and attempted to end the discussion quite concisely. So unless the meaning of the word has changed in the last hour or so, I don't believe I'm the troll here. But once again, I extend to you permission to believe whatever you so desire. I don't care. And feel free to continue proving my point; you are a slave to your most toxic habits. You're still here because you're unable to stop. You simply must have the last word. You can't help it.

And Rinne Sharingan is stronger than Rinnegan, so he should scale above Naruto and Sasuke at this point. Not to mention fact that he is more versitile.\n\nI understand the thought process, but no. He never once proved to be above them. All of his buffs absolutely pale in compairson to Kaguya and her power, and again, we saw how well Naruto was handling himself against her. He was doing *more* than just \"handling\" himself. He was actually soloing her by himself. \n\nThe point is Juubidara pales in comparison to her, and even Kaguya herself wasn't enough to completely overwhelm them. Naruto and Sasuke with their six paths powers during the war were far more powerful than anyone gave them credit for. And Madara wasn't more versatile than they were. It's funny, because as much as people were saying Juubidara was holding back/hiding power, so were Naruto and Sasuke. Naruto only made 4 clones to fight the Limbo clones instead of making like 10 or 500, and he never used boil release on him yet. And just like how his Limbo clones could use Susanoo, Naruto's shadow clones can all manifest the Kurama avatar. He could also literally use 3 headed Kurama at any given moment as well. Could also probably give Sasuke some bijuu chakra to amp his Susanoo like Sasuke did in their fight against each other.\n\n>You never showed scan of them being able to even touch him after getting Six Paths Power.\n\nThat's never been the discussion. We're talking about the misconception Madara was \"above\" them, despite his feats heavily suggesting otherwise.",

Like when he speed blitzed her. Slapped her with 9 rasenshuriken. When he matched her power on *numerous* occasions. How he was controlling the battle against her with his shadow clones. \n\nIt doesn't matter if she was serious or not, not when even when she did decide to get serious and try to kill Naruto and Sasuke, she was still utterly incapable of doing it.\n\n>But she wasn't serious, and wanted his Chakra. Few moments later she litteraly slaps him.\n\n\nLmao, \"slaps\". All you seem to be able to do is turn an ant-hill into a mountain. She pushed him back and poofed clones. She never once landed any real attacks on him, nor was she able to damage either of these kids to any significant degree the *entire* battle. In fact, she performed so poorly against these kids they both evidently had the energy to immediately fight each other for almost an entire 24 hours because Kaguya clearly couldn't even tire them out the entire time she fought them.\n\n\n\n>He is one pearson and he has both of Naruto's and Sasuke's Main powers(Tailed beast/Sage Mode and EMS/Rinnegan). In both cases better than theirs.\n\nCompletely irrelevant, and absolutely *nothing* proves or suggests he was better than them with their own powers. What he was to them was *stronger* than them individually. That's it.\n\n>Clones might be a problem, tho Madara knows Shinra Tensei and other large scale attacks. He also should have Xhakra at least comparable to Naruto, and spam wood clones.\n\nNothing in his arsenal will be enough to stop his clones. Not when Naruto can simply make more.\n\n>Would need to gather nature energy first, it would take some time.\n\nWhich would be easy. Madara's too focused on everything and everyone else in the battle to care about what that 1 clone is doing. He wouldn't even notice a clone leaving, let alone stopping it from doing what it's gonna do. He'd need to get past Naruto first for that.\n\n\n>Sasuke isn't really a problem here. He doesn't scale to Naruto, so he doesn't have any feats to put him on level of upper Six Paths characters.\n\nHe's literally directly comparable to Naruto. It's hard to take you seriously when you repeatedly say shit like this bro. No he isn't stronger than Naruto, but he's still in the same tier as him and directly comparable *to* him.\n\n>It's also worth noting, that all Madara needs to do is killing Sasuke. After that, he can use Mugen Tsukiyome and it's GG.\n\nHe's not gonna kill Sasuke. Sasuke's hax makes up for what power he lacks, that's always been common knowledge.",

Your foolish tenacity has been acknowledged. But this is a battle that you shall lose all the same, because if the argument is that Naruto couldn't have won without Kurama, then the solution for me is even simpler than before. Naruto not only could've won without Kurama, but absolutely would have if it weren't for Ma and Pa. Their presence was a hindrance more than it was a help. Pa attempted to use the same genjutsu on Pain that they'd used with Jiraiya when they first fought Pain, which immediately prompted him to kill Pa. Naruto's attempt to save them is what got him caught and things went downhill from there. If they simply hadn't been present, or otherwise hadn't been attacked, Naruto would've won by himself in the exact same way he ultimately did anyways. The only difference is that it would've been without Kurama's intervention.",

Interesting. I do believe I made it quite clear that I don't care about the discussion earlier. I hardly considered it an argument, let alone a matter of winning or losing. It's an anime and I don't put genuine effort or emotional investment into discussions about fictional characters or settings. However, I did raise actual points. I made sound arguments backed by evidence. You on the other hand quite literally just kept repeating yourself again and again,. \"Lma0\" this, \"actually\" that, and you never once explained your reasoning or gave any sort of evidence as to your point. Clearly you care about winning far more than I do, since you're still prattling on about it, whereas I had already moved on and attempted to end the discussion quite concisely. So unless the meaning of the word has changed in the last hour or so, I don't believe I'm the troll here. But once again, I extend to you permission to believe whatever you so desire. I don't care. And feel free to continue proving my point; you are a slave to your most toxic habits. You're still here because you're unable to stop. You simply must have the last word. You can't help it.

For argument sake, if you want to call Kurama one of Naruto\u2019s abilities that can only be said during the War arc because Naruto is actually able to use Kurama. During the Pain arc Kurama is taking over Naruto\u2019s body, there\u2019s no way you can classify Kurama as Naruto\u2019s ability during the Pain arc. \n\nThe rinnegan are Nagatos eyes even if they\u2019ve been implanted. He had to learn to use them and control the six paths. \n\nCan you also explain why Kurama needed Naruto to win?",

                    "body": ">Not really. He only managed to hit her like 2 times. Once in Sexy Jutsu, once when he used boil release and clones.\n\nNo, he did far more than that. Like when he speed blitzed her. Slapped her with 9 rasenshuriken. When he matched her power on *numerous* occasions. How he was controlling the battle against her with his shadow clones. \n\nIt doesn't matter if she was serious or not, not when even when she did decide to get serious and try to kill Naruto and Sasuke, she was still utterly incapable of doing it.\n\n>But she wasn't serious, and wanted his Chakra. Few moments later she litteraly slaps him.\n\n\nLmao, \"slaps\". All you seem to be able to do is turn an ant-hill into a mountain. She pushed him back and poofed clones. She never once landed any real attacks on him, nor was she able to damage either of these kids to any significant degree the *entire* battle. In fact, she performed so poorly against these kids they both evidently had the energy to immediately fight each other for almost an entire 24 hours because Kaguya clearly couldn't even tire them out the entire time she fought them.\n\n\n\n>He is one pearson and he has both of Naruto's and Sasuke's Main powers(Tailed beast/Sage Mode and EMS/Rinnegan). In both cases better than theirs.\n\nCompletely irrelevant, and absolutely *nothing* proves or suggests he was better than them with their own powers. What he was to them was *stronger* than them individually. That's it.\n\n>Clones might be a problem, tho Madara knows Shinra Tensei and other large scale attacks. He also should have Xhakra at least comparable to Naruto, and spam wood clones.\n\nNothing in his arsenal will be enough to stop his clones. Not when Naruto can simply make more.\n\n>Would need to gather nature energy first, it would take some time.\n\nWhich would be easy. Madara's too focused on everything and everyone else in the battle to care about what that 1 clone is doing. He wouldn't even notice a clone leaving, let alone stopping it from doing what it's gonna do. He'd need to get past Naruto first for that.\n\n\n>Sasuke isn't really a problem here. He doesn't scale to Naruto, so he doesn't have any feats to put him on level of upper Six Paths characters.\n\nHe's literally directly comparable to Naruto. It's hard to take you seriously when you repeatedly say shit like this bro. No he isn't stronger than Naruto, but he's still in the same tier as him and directly comparable *to* him.\n\n>It's also worth noting, that all Madara needs to do is killing Sasuke. After that, he can use Mugen Tsukiyome and it's GG.\n\nHe's not gonna kill Sasuke. Sasuke's hax makes up for what power he lacks, that's always been common knowledge.",

You accost others with performative idiocy, dragging them down to your level and beating them with experience.

I do believe I made it quite clear that I don't care about the discussion earlier. I hardly considered it an argument, let alone a matter of winning or losing. It's an anime and I don't put genuine effort or emotional investment into discussions about fictional characters or settings. However, I did raise actual points. I made sound arguments backed by evidence. You on the other hand quite literally just kept repeating yourself again and again,. \"Lma0\" this, \"actually\" that, and you never once explained your reasoning or gave any sort of evidence as to your point. Clearly you care about winning far more than I do, since you're still prattling on about it, whereas I had already moved on and attempted to end the discussion quite concisely. So unless the meaning of the word has changed in the last hour or so, I don't believe I'm the troll here. But once again, I extend to you permission to believe whatever you so desire. I don't care. And feel free to continue proving my point; you are a slave to your most toxic habits. You're still here because you're unable to stop. You simply must have the last word. You can't help it.

Like when he speed blitzed her. Slapped her with 9 rasenshuriken. When he matched her power on *numerous* occasions. How he was controlling the battle against her with his shadow clones. \n\nIt doesn't matter if she was serious or not, not when even when she did decide to get serious and try to kill Naruto and Sasuke, she was still utterly incapable of doing it.\n\n>But she wasn't serious, and wanted his Chakra. Few moments later she litteraly slaps him.\n\n\nLmao, \"slaps\". All you seem to be able to do is turn an ant-hill into a mountain. She pushed him back and poofed clones. She never once landed any real attacks on him, nor was she able to damage either of these kids to any significant degree the *entire* battle. In fact, she performed so poorly against these kids they both evidently had the energy to immediately fight each other for almost an entire 24 hours because Kaguya clearly couldn't even tire them out the entire time she fought them.\n\n\n\n>He is one pearson and he has both of Naruto's and Sasuke's Main powers(Tailed beast/Sage Mode and EMS/Rinnegan). In both cases better than theirs.\n\nCompletely irrelevant, and absolutely *nothing* proves or suggests he was better than them with their own powers. What he was to them was *stronger* than them individually. That's it.\n\n>Clones might be a problem, tho Madara knows Shinra Tensei and other large scale attacks. He also should have Xhakra at least comparable to Naruto, and spam wood clones.\n\nNothing in his arsenal will be enough to stop his clones. Not when Naruto can simply make more.\n\n>Would need to gather nature energy first, it would take some time.\n\nWhich would be easy. Madara's too focused on everything and everyone else in the battle to care about what that 1 clone is doing. He wouldn't even notice a clone leaving, let alone stopping it from doing what it's gonna do. He'd need to get past Naruto first for that.\n\n\n>Sasuke isn't really a problem here. He doesn't scale to Naruto, so he doesn't have any feats to put him on level of upper Six Paths characters.\n\nHe's literally directly comparable to Naruto. It's hard to take you seriously when you repeatedly say shit like this bro. No he isn't stronger than Naruto, but he's still in the same tier as him and directly comparable *to* him.\n\n>It's also worth noting, that all Madara needs to do is killing Sasuke. After that, he can use Mugen Tsukiyome and it's GG.\n\nHe's not gonna kill Sasuke. Sasuke's hax makes up for what power he lacks, that's always been common knowledge.",

I do believe I made it quite clear that I don't care about the discussion earlier. I hardly considered it an argument, let alone a matter of winning or losing. It's an anime and I don't put genuine effort or emotional investment into discussions about fictional characters or settings. However, I did raise actual points. I made sound arguments backed by evidence. You on the other hand quite literally just kept repeating yourself again and again,. \"Lma0\" this, \"actually\" that, and you never once explained your reasoning or gave any sort of evidence as to your point. Clearly you care about winning far more than I do, since you're still prattling on about it, whereas I had already moved on and attempted to end the discussion quite concisely. So unless the meaning of the word has changed in the last hour or so, I don't believe I'm the troll here. But once again, I extend to you permission to believe whatever you so desire. I don't care. And feel free to continue proving my point; you are a slave to your most toxic habits. You're still here because you're unable to stop. You simply must have the last word. You can't help it.

I do believe I made it quite clear that I don't care about the discussion earlier. I hardly considered it an argument, let alone a matter of winning or losing. It's an anime and I don't put genuine effort or emotional investment into discussions about fictional characters or settings. However, I did raise actual points. I made sound arguments backed by evidence. You on the other hand quite literally just kept repeating yourself again and again,. \"Lma0\" this, \"actually\" that, and you never once explained your reasoning or gave any sort of evidence as to your point. Clearly you care about winning far more than I do, since you're still prattling on about it, whereas I had already moved on and attempted to end the discussion quite concisely. So unless the meaning of the word has changed in the last hour or so, I don't believe I'm the troll here. But once again, I extend to you permission to believe whatever you so desire. I don't care. And feel free to continue proving my point; you are a slave to your most toxic habits. You're still here because you're unable to stop. You simply must have the last word. You can't help it.

I do believe I made it quite clear that I don't care about the discussion earlier. I hardly considered it an argument, let alone a matter of winning or losing. It's an anime and I don't put genuine effort or emotional investment into discussions about fictional characters or settings. However, I did raise actual points. I made sound arguments backed by evidence. You on the other hand quite literally just kept repeating yourself again and again,. \"Lma0\" this, \"actually\" that, and you never once explained your reasoning or gave any sort of evidence as to your point. Clearly you care about winning far more than I do, since you're still prattling on about it, whereas I had already moved on and attempted to end the discussion quite concisely. So unless the meaning of the word has changed in the last hour or so, I don't believe I'm the troll here. But once again, I extend to you permission to believe whatever you so desire. I don't care. And feel free to continue proving my point; you are a slave to your most toxic habits. You're still here because you're unable to stop. You simply must have the last word. You can't help it.

I do believe I made it quite clear that I don't care about the discussion earlier. I hardly considered it an argument, let alone a matter of winning or losing. It's an anime and I don't put genuine effort or emotional investment into discussions about fictional characters or settings. However, I did raise actual points. I made sound arguments backed by evidence. You on the other hand quite literally just kept repeating yourself again and again,. \"Lma0\" this, \"actually\" that, and you never once explained your reasoning or gave any sort of evidence as to your point. Clearly you care about winning far more than I do, since you're still prattling on about it, whereas I had already moved on and attempted to end the discussion quite concisely. So unless the meaning of the word has changed in the last hour or so, I don't believe I'm the troll here. But once again, I extend to you permission to believe whatever you so desire. I don't care. And feel free to continue proving my point; you are a slave to your most toxic habits. You're still here because you're unable to stop. You simply must have the last word. You can't help it.

I do believe I made it quite clear that I don't care about the discussion earlier. I hardly considered it an argument, let alone a matter of winning or losing. It's an anime and I don't put genuine effort or emotional investment into discussions about fictional characters or settings. However, I did raise actual points. I made sound arguments backed by evidence. You on the other hand quite literally just kept repeating yourself again and again,. \"Lma0\" this, \"actually\" that, and you never once explained your reasoning or gave any sort of evidence as to your point. Clearly you care about winning far more than I do, since you're still prattling on about it, whereas I had already moved on and attempted to end the discussion quite concisely. So unless the meaning of the word has changed in the last hour or so, I don't believe I'm the troll here. But once again, I extend to you permission to believe whatever you so desire. I don't care. And feel free to continue proving my point; you are a slave to your most toxic habits. You're still here because you're unable to stop. You simply must have the last word. You can't help it.

I do believe I made it quite clear that I don't care about the discussion earlier. I hardly considered it an argument, let alone a matter of winning or losing. It's an anime and I don't put genuine effort or emotional investment into discussions about fictional characters or settings. However, I did raise actual points. I made sound arguments backed by evidence. You on the other hand quite literally just kept repeating yourself again and again,. \"Lma0\" this, \"actually\" that, and you never once explained your reasoning or gave any sort of evidence as to your point. Clearly you care about winning far more than I do, since you're still prattling on about it, whereas I had already moved on and attempted to end the discussion quite concisely. So unless the meaning of the word has changed in the last hour or so, I don't believe I'm the troll here. But once again, I extend to you permission to believe whatever you so desire. I don't care. And feel free to continue proving my point; you are a slave to your most toxic habits. You're still here because you're unable to stop. You simply must have the last word. You can't help it.

I do believe I made it quite clear that I don't care about the discussion earlier. I hardly considered it an argument, let alone a matter of winning or losing. It's an anime and I don't put genuine effort or emotional investment into discussions about fictional characters or settings. However, I did raise actual points. I made sound arguments backed by evidence. You on the other hand quite literally just kept repeating yourself again and again,. \"Lma0\" this, \"actually\" that, and you never once explained your reasoning or gave any sort of evidence as to your point. Clearly you care about winning far more than I do, since you're still prattling on about it, whereas I had already moved on and attempted to end the discussion quite concisely. So unless the meaning of the word has changed in the last hour or so, I don't believe I'm the troll here. But once again, I extend to you permission to believe whatever you so desire. I don't care. And feel free to continue proving my point; you are a slave to your most toxic habits. You're still here because you're unable to stop. You simply must have the last word. You can't help it.

I do believe I made it quite clear that I don't care about the discussion earlier. I hardly considered it an argument, let alone a matter of winning or losing. It's an anime and I don't put genuine effort or emotional investment into discussions about fictional characters or settings. However, I did raise actual points. I made sound arguments backed by evidence. You on the other hand quite literally just kept repeating yourself again and again,. \"Lma0\" this, \"actually\" that, and you never once explained your reasoning or gave any sort of evidence as to your point. Clearly you care about winning far more than I do, since you're still prattling on about it, whereas I had already moved on and attempted to end the discussion quite concisely. So unless the meaning of the word has changed in the last hour or so, I don't believe I'm the troll here. But once again, I extend to you permission to believe whatever you so desire. I don't care. And feel free to continue proving my point; you are a slave to your most toxic habits. You're still here because you're unable to stop. You simply must have the last word. You can't help it.

I do believe I made it quite clear that I don't care about the discussion earlier. I hardly considered it an argument, let alone a matter of winning or losing. It's an anime and I don't put genuine effort or emotional investment into discussions about fictional characters or settings. However, I did raise actual points. I made sound arguments backed by evidence. You on the other hand quite literally just kept repeating yourself again and again,. \"Lma0\" this, \"actually\" that, and you never once explained your reasoning or gave any sort of evidence as to your point. Clearly you care about winning far more than I do, since you're still prattling on about it, whereas I had already moved on and attempted to end the discussion quite concisely. So unless the meaning of the word has changed in the last hour or so, I don't believe I'm the troll here. But once again, I extend to you permission to believe whatever you so desire. I don't care. And feel free to continue proving my point; you are a slave to your most toxic habits. You're still here because you're unable to stop. You simply must have the last word. You can't help it.

I hardly considered it an argument, let alone a matter of winning or losing. It's an anime and I don't put genuine effort or emotional investment into discussions about fictional characters or settings. However, I did raise actual points. I made sound arguments backed by evidence. You on the other hand quite literally just kept repeating yourself again and again,. \"Lma0\" this, \"actually\" that, and you never once explained your reasoning or gave any sort of evidence as to your point. Clearly you care about winning far more than I do, since you're still prattling on about it, whereas I had already moved on and attempted to end the discussion quite concisely. So unless the meaning of the word has changed in the last hour or so, I don't believe I'm the troll here. But once again, I extend to you permission to believe whatever you so desire. I don't care. And feel free to continue proving my point; you are a slave to your most toxic habits. You're still here because you're unable to stop. You simply must have the last word. You can't help it.

I hardly considered it an argument, let alone a matter of winning or losing. It's an anime and I don't put genuine effort or emotional investment into discussions about fictional characters or settings. However, I did raise actual points. I made sound arguments backed by evidence. You on the other hand quite literally just kept repeating yourself again and again,. \"Lma0\" this, \"actually\" that, and you never once explained your reasoning or gave any sort of evidence as to your point. Clearly you care about winning far more than I do, since you're still prattling on about it, whereas I had already moved on and attempted to end the discussion quite concisely. So unless the meaning of the word has changed in the last hour or so, I don't believe I'm the troll here. But once again, I extend to you permission to believe whatever you so desire. I don't care. And feel free to continue proving my point; you are a slave to your most toxic habits. You're still here because you're unable to stop. You simply must have the last word. You can't help it.

I hardly considered it an argument, let alone a matter of winning or losing. It's an anime and I don't put genuine effort or emotional investment into discussions about fictional characters or settings. However, I did raise actual points. I made sound arguments backed by evidence. You on the other hand quite literally just kept repeating yourself again and again,. \"Lma0\" this, \"actually\" that, and you never once explained your reasoning or gave any sort of evidence as to your point. Clearly you care about winning far more than I do, since you're still prattling on about it, whereas I had already moved on and attempted to end the discussion quite concisely. So unless the meaning of the word has changed in the last hour or so, I don't believe I'm the troll here. But once again, I extend to you permission to believe whatever you so desire. I don't care. And feel free to continue proving my point; you are a slave to your most toxic habits. You're still here because you're unable to stop. You simply must have the last word. You can't help it.

I hardly considered it an argument, let alone a matter of winning or losing. It's an anime and I don't put genuine effort or emotional investment into discussions about fictional characters or settings. However, I did raise actual points. I made sound arguments backed by evidence. You on the other hand quite literally just kept repeating yourself again and again,. \"Lma0\" this, \"actually\" that, and you never once explained your reasoning or gave any sort of evidence as to your point. Clearly you care about winning far more than I do, since you're still prattling on about it, whereas I had already moved on and attempted to end the discussion quite concisely. So unless the meaning of the word has changed in the last hour or so, I don't believe I'm the troll here. But once again, I extend to you permission to believe whatever you so desire. I don't care. And feel free to continue proving my point; you are a slave to your most toxic habits. You're still here because you're unable to stop. You simply must have the last word. You can't help it.

I hardly considered it an argument, let alone a matter of winning or losing. It's an anime and I don't put genuine effort or emotional investment into discussions about fictional characters or settings. However, I did raise actual points. I made sound arguments backed by evidence. You on the other hand quite literally just kept repeating yourself again and again,. \"Lma0\" this, \"actually\" that, and you never once explained your reasoning or gave any sort of evidence as to your point. Clearly you care about winning far more than I do, since you're still prattling on about it, whereas I had already moved on and attempted to end the discussion quite concisely. So unless the meaning of the word has changed in the last hour or so, I don't believe I'm the troll here. But once again, I extend to you permission to believe whatever you so desire. I don't care. And feel free to continue proving my point; you are a slave to your most toxic habits. You're still here because you're unable to stop. You simply must have the last word. You can't help it.

I hardly considered it an argument, let alone a matter of winning or losing. It's an anime and I don't put genuine effort or emotional investment into discussions about fictional characters or settings. However, I did raise actual points. I made sound arguments backed by evidence. You on the other hand quite literally just kept repeating yourself again and again,. \"Lma0\" this, \"actually\" that, and you never once explained your reasoning or gave any sort of evidence as to your point. Clearly you care about winning far more than I do, since you're still prattling on about it, whereas I had already moved on and attempted to end the discussion quite concisely. So unless the meaning of the word has changed in the last hour or so, I don't believe I'm the troll here. But once again, I extend to you permission to believe whatever you so desire. I don't care. And feel free to continue proving my point; you are a slave to your most toxic habits. You're still here because you're unable to stop. You simply must have the last word. You can't help it.

I hardly considered it an argument, let alone a matter of winning or losing. It's an anime and I don't put genuine effort or emotional investment into discussions about fictional characters or settings. However, I did raise actual points. I made sound arguments backed by evidence. You on the other hand quite literally just kept repeating yourself again and again,. \"Lma0\" this, \"actually\" that, and you never once explained your reasoning or gave any sort of evidence as to your point. Clearly you care about winning far more than I do, since you're still prattling on about it, whereas I had already moved on and attempted to end the discussion quite concisely. So unless the meaning of the word has changed in the last hour or so, I don't believe I'm the troll here. But once again, I extend to you permission to believe whatever you so desire. I don't care. And feel free to continue proving my point; you are a slave to your most toxic habits. You're still here because you're unable to stop. You simply must have the last word. You can't help it.

I hardly considered it an argument, let alone a matter of winning or losing. It's an anime and I don't put genuine effort or emotional investment into discussions about fictional characters or settings. However, I did raise actual points. I made sound arguments backed by evidence. You on the other hand quite literally just kept repeating yourself again and again,. \"Lma0\" this, \"actually\" that, and you never once explained your reasoning or gave any sort of evidence as to your point. Clearly you care about winning far more than I do, since you're still prattling on about it, whereas I had already moved on and attempted to end the discussion quite concisely. So unless the meaning of the word has changed in the last hour or so, I don't believe I'm the troll here. But once again, I extend to you permission to believe whatever you so desire. I don't care. And feel free to continue proving my point; you are a slave to your most toxic habits. You're still here because you're unable to stop. You simply must have the last word. You can't help it.
