EVERYBODY has something to bring to the relationship besides great looks and sexual skills. With barely a month into this, I agree that \\*some\\* POT SBs do a poor job of explaining their other interests, skills, etc. Some do it very well. Two examples: I met a gorgeous F20 who mentioned that she's a great ballroom dancer and could teach me. Another F25 was a CIA-trained chef (Culinary Institute of America, not the spy agency) and could help me be a better cook for my kids. Those are both very interesting to me. Everybody has something like that.",

Character isn't built; it is **revealed.**\n\nSo let's just be the best people we can be to other good people who deserve to be loved, and let's actively avoid the jerks as best we can. My friends, have you told your sugar baby/daddy how much you cherish them lately? I know I fall behind sometimes and hope this is a helpful reminder.",
