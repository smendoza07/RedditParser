    "body": "I got a heinous std from my SB. We had exchanged recent test results prior to ditching condoms, both negative all around. Turns out there is an STD that is never tested for on even comprehensive panels, is increasingly common, and easily resistant to antibiotics. It's called mycoplasma genitalium. Most women that have it dont know because it rarely causes symptoms in women. Can have it for years and not know. So not my SB's fault. But lucky me, it was a variety resistant to azithromycin, so my infection just got worse and worse waiting for the zithromax to work. The pain, OMG the pain. Don't be like me . . . Wrap it up people! The medical community is way behind the curve on this one.",

Not normally included in any std panel, you need to ask for it. Even then testing can be a bit finicky. Best bet is first piss of the morning and catch the first urine out. For women need vaginal and cervical swabs. Antibiotic resistance to first line treatment, zithromax, is common. Resistance to second line, moxifloxacin is growing. Over 50% in Japan for example. No well researched or readily available third line treatment. Its pristiamycin which is not available or hard to get in US. Sorry if TMI. I feel like an expert in this shit now. It's scary.",

Even then testing can be a bit finicky. Best bet is first piss of the morning and catch the first urine out. For women need vaginal and cervical swabs. Antibiotic resistance to first line treatment, zithromax, is common. Resistance to second line, moxifloxacin is growing. Over 50% in Japan for example. No well researched or readily available third line treatment. Its pristiamycin which is not available or hard to get in US. Sorry if TMI. I feel like an expert in this shit now. It's scary.",
