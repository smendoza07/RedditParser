Hoping it would bring them together. Instead ninjutsu, derivative of ninshu, resulted in war all cause those 3 started fighting each other.\n\nThen kaguya was like \"oh shit my ancestors are gonna be mad time to make zetsu\" even though zetsu w/o hashirama cells is inferior to an average shinobi. And even the most powerful shinobi is getting spanked by otsusuki all the time or just barely defeating them.",

Otsutsukis, much like the Hyuuga, also use the branch system. Isshiki was a guy from the Main Branch of the Otsutsuki Clan and Kaguya was from the Secondary Branch, which means that she was basically his slave.  \n\n\nIsshiki was suppose to plant the Juubi and let him devour Kaguya to become the Giant Tree, absorb all humans and produce the chakra fruits, then Isshiki would take the fruits and go back to his planet to deliver them to the Otsutsuki King. Kaguya didn't wanted to be sacrificed - so she betrayed him and killed him with a fatal blow from the back and fed him to the Juubi - she then proceeded to claim the tree and its fruits all to herself.  \n\n\nShe knew that the Otsutsuki King would send someone to Earth to check why Isshiki didn't came back. So she started to transform humanity on Zetsus so she could have an army to use against Momoshiki, Urashiki and Kinshiki (the ones that the Otsutsuki King sent after her)  \n\n\nIt's unclear how Hagoromo and Hamuwa were born since their father was never shown on the manga. But they were born some time after she enslaved humanity, but before she became paranoid, completely scared of Momoshiki's arrival.",

Similary, in this image, this girl did not have a third eye which becomes a differentiating point between Kaguya and this girl. \n\nAnother thing that real Otsutsukis have is a horn. Kaguya(adult) had it, Isshiki had it, Momo, Kinshiki and Urashiki also. But neither this girl, nor Jigen had a horn. This makes me believe that this girl is actually a vessel. Another reason would be, In the episodes we see that an Otsutsuki must be fed to the divine tree for it to blossom. Kaguya fought Isshiki but never fed Isshiki into divine tree(rather Isshiki went inside Jigen). But that would mean Kaguya fed herself to divine tree(otherwise it wouldn't grow in the first place). So she must have put Karma on that girl.",

Hoping it would bring them together. Instead ninjutsu, derivative of ninshu, resulted in war all cause those 3 started fighting each other.\n\nThen kaguya was like \"oh shit my ancestors are gonna be mad time to make zetsu\" even though zetsu w/o hashirama cells is inferior to an average shinobi. And even the most powerful shinobi is getting spanked by otsusuki all the time or just barely defeating them.",

Otsutsukis, much like the Hyuuga, also use the branch system. Isshiki was a guy from the Main Branch of the Otsutsuki Clan and Kaguya was from the Secondary Branch, which means that she was basically his slave.  \n\n\nIsshiki was suppose to plant the Juubi and let him devour Kaguya to become the Giant Tree, absorb all humans and produce the chakra fruits, then Isshiki would take the fruits and go back to his planet to deliver them to the Otsutsuki King. Kaguya didn't wanted to be sacrificed - so she betrayed him and killed him with a fatal blow from the back and fed him to the Juubi - she then proceeded to claim the tree and its fruits all to herself.  \n\n\nShe knew that the Otsutsuki King would send someone to Earth to check why Isshiki didn't came back. So she started to transform humanity on Zetsus so she could have an army to use against Momoshiki, Urashiki and Kinshiki (the ones that the Otsutsuki King sent after her)  \n\n\nIt's unclear how Hagoromo and Hamuwa were born since their father was never shown on the manga. But they were born some time after she enslaved humanity, but before she became paranoid, completely scared of Momoshiki's arrival.",

Similary, in this image, this girl did not have a third eye which becomes a differentiating point between Kaguya and this girl. \n\nAnother thing that real Otsutsukis have is a horn. Kaguya(adult) had it, Isshiki had it, Momo, Kinshiki and Urashiki also. But neither this girl, nor Jigen had a horn. This makes me believe that this girl is actually a vessel. Another reason would be, In the episodes we see that an Otsutsuki must be fed to the divine tree for it to blossom. Kaguya fought Isshiki but never fed Isshiki into divine tree(rather Isshiki went inside Jigen). But that would mean Kaguya fed herself to divine tree(otherwise it wouldn't grow in the first place). So she must have put Karma on that girl.",

It must have evolved along side them, because an otsusuki is necessary for its cultivation or maybe something else. \n\nIt seems pretty clear that momoshiki is the new big bad guy. They should just kill boruto though and I wish Sasuke had. The intro for a long time has shown Kawaki is basically going to defend the leaf against boruto and succeed. \n\nKawaki will likely learn under the tutelage of naruto. \n\nI genuinely hope Sasuke replaces his eye with another sharingan (or naruto uses so6p to restore it because he can still do that) or pursues snake sage, because Sasuke would be a natural master of it and mitsukis small mastery of it or kabutos versatility with it are pretty OP.",

Kaguya didn't wanted to be sacrificed - so she betrayed him and killed him with a fatal blow from the back and fed him to the Juubi - she then proceeded to claim the tree and its fruits all to herself.  \n\n\nShe knew that the Otsutsuki King would send someone to Earth to check why Isshiki didn't came back. So she started to transform humanity on Zetsus so she could have an army to use against Momoshiki, Urashiki and Kinshiki (the ones that the Otsutsuki King sent after her)  \n\n\nIt's unclear how Hagoromo and Hamuwa were born since their father was never shown on the manga. But they were born some time after she enslaved humanity, but before she became paranoid, completely scared of Momoshiki's arrival.",

Similary, in this image, this girl did not have a third eye which becomes a differentiating point between Kaguya and this girl. \n\nAnother thing that real Otsutsukis have is a horn. Kaguya(adult) had it, Isshiki had it, Momo, Kinshiki and Urashiki also. But neither this girl, nor Jigen had a horn. This makes me believe that this girl is actually a vessel. Another reason would be, In the episodes we see that an Otsutsuki must be fed to the divine tree for it to blossom. Kaguya fought Isshiki but never fed Isshiki into divine tree(rather Isshiki went inside Jigen). But that would mean Kaguya fed herself to divine tree(otherwise it wouldn't grow in the first place). So she must have put Karma on that girl.",

They should just kill boruto though and I wish Sasuke had. The intro for a long time has shown Kawaki is basically going to defend the leaf against boruto and succeed. \n\nKawaki will likely learn under the tutelage of naruto. \n\nI genuinely hope Sasuke replaces his eye with another sharingan (or naruto uses so6p to restore it because he can still do that) or pursues snake sage, because Sasuke would be a natural master of it and mitsukis small mastery of it or kabutos versatility with it are pretty OP.",

Infact you're the one who made the claim, i was responding to you. So you're the one who should \"prove it\"",

Otsutsukis, much like the Hyuuga, also use the branch system. Isshiki was a guy from the Main Branch of the Otsutsuki Clan and Kaguya was from the Secondary Branch, which means that she was basically his slave.  \n\n\nIsshiki was suppose to plant the Juubi and let him devour Kaguya to become the Giant Tree, absorb all humans and produce the chakra fruits, then Isshiki would take the fruits and go back to his planet to deliver them to the Otsutsuki King. Kaguya didn't wanted to be sacrificed - so she betrayed him and killed him with a fatal blow from the back and fed him to the Juubi - she then proceeded to claim the tree and its fruits all to herself.  \n\n\nShe knew that the Otsutsuki King would send someone to Earth to check why Isshiki didn't came back. So she started to transform humanity on Zetsus so she could have an army to use against Momoshiki, Urashiki and Kinshiki (the ones that the Otsutsuki King sent after her)  \n\n\nIt's unclear how Hagoromo and Hamuwa were born since their father was never shown on the manga. But they were born some time after she enslaved humanity, but before she became paranoid, completely scared of Momoshiki's arrival.",

It must have evolved along side them, because an otsusuki is necessary for its cultivation or maybe something else. \n\nIt seems pretty clear that momoshiki is the new big bad guy. They should just kill boruto though and I wish Sasuke had. The intro for a long time has shown Kawaki is basically going to defend the leaf against boruto and succeed. \n\nKawaki will likely learn under the tutelage of naruto. \n\nI genuinely hope Sasuke replaces his eye with another sharingan (or naruto uses so6p to restore it because he can still do that) or pursues snake sage, because Sasuke would be a natural master of it and mitsukis small mastery of it or kabutos versatility with it are pretty OP.",

Kaguya didn't wanted to be sacrificed - so she betrayed him and killed him with a fatal blow from the back and fed him to the Juubi - she then proceeded to claim the tree and its fruits all to herself.  \n\n\nShe knew that the Otsutsuki King would send someone to Earth to check why Isshiki didn't came back. So she started to transform humanity on Zetsus so she could have an army to use against Momoshiki, Urashiki and Kinshiki (the ones that the Otsutsuki King sent after her)  \n\n\nIt's unclear how Hagoromo and Hamuwa were born since their father was never shown on the manga.

Kaguya didn't wanted to be sacrificed - so she betrayed him and killed him with a fatal blow from the back and fed him to the Juubi - she then proceeded to claim the tree and its fruits all to herself.  \n\n\nShe knew that the Otsutsuki King would send someone to Earth to check why Isshiki didn't came back. So she started to transform humanity on Zetsus so she could have an army to use against Momoshiki, Urashiki and Kinshiki (the ones that the Otsutsuki King sent after her)  \n\n\nIt's unclear how Hagoromo and Hamuwa were born since their father was never shown on the manga. But they were born some time after she enslaved humanity, but before she became paranoid, completely scared of Momoshiki's arrival.",

They should just kill boruto though and I wish Sasuke had. The intro for a long time has shown Kawaki is basically going to defend the leaf against boruto and succeed. \n\nKawaki will likely learn under the tutelage of naruto. \n\nI genuinely hope Sasuke replaces his eye with another sharingan (or naruto uses so6p to restore it because he can still do that) or pursues snake sage, because Sasuke would be a natural master of it and mitsukis small mastery of it or kabutos versatility with it are pretty OP.",

They should just kill boruto though and I wish Sasuke had. The intro for a long time has shown Kawaki is basically going to defend the leaf against boruto and succeed. \n\nKawaki will likely learn under the tutelage of naruto. \n\nI genuinely hope Sasuke replaces his eye with another sharingan (or naruto uses so6p to restore it because he can still do that) or pursues snake sage, because Sasuke would be a natural master of it and mitsukis small mastery of it or kabutos versatility with it are pretty OP.",

They should just kill boruto though and I wish Sasuke had. The intro for a long time has shown Kawaki is basically going to defend the leaf against boruto and succeed. \n\nKawaki will likely learn under the tutelage of naruto. \n\nI genuinely hope Sasuke replaces his eye with another sharingan (or naruto uses so6p to restore it because he can still do that) or pursues snake sage, because Sasuke would be a natural master of it and mitsukis small mastery of it or kabutos versatility with it are pretty OP.",
