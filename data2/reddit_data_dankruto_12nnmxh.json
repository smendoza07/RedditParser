Their ancestors were actual brothers. \n\nI dont think you realize but you actually just made my point tho. They were saying that without a strong family line youd only make it to chunnin and i was saying thats not bad considering thats the average ninja. If you think the average ninja is a genning then that just makes my point more valid.\n\nBut im going to just agree to disagree. I agree with some of what you said and disagree with other things. And it would take way too long to point out each thing i dont agree with. Plus english doesnt seem like your best language. \nEither way from what ive seen in the show. 99% of gennin are children. And the 1 gennin we saw that was an adult was BULLIED AND LAUGHED AT by the ENTIRE VILLAGE. So no. I do not think thats the average ninja. \nI think your getting too political with this. Dont bring up real life and real countries when talking about an anime.",

The manga outright shows and implies that this stuff happens multiple times. One of the teachers for the chuunin exams had a head full of holes and scars left from being brutally tortured. Naruto and Jiraiya have a habit of peeking into the showers. Gaara had his corpse desecrated. And last but certainly not least, Karin made multiple advances on Sasuke and at one point planned to drug Juugo and Suigetsu so she could \"ravage him\".",

But they both are not taijustu users and usually use justu\u2019s. Itachi has rarely actually shown feats of him using hand to hand combat. I would argue that Kakashi is a better Tai justu user than Itachi just because he has more feats and was fighting Hidan with a fucking Kunai. Itachi is a Genjustu master above almost everything, like taking away his Genjustu would be like taking away 50% of his arsenal lmao",

If you think the average ninja is a genning then that just makes my point more valid.\n\nBut im going to just agree to disagree. I agree with some of what you said and disagree with other things. And it would take way too long to point out each thing i dont agree with. Plus english doesnt seem like your best language. \nEither way from what ive seen in the show. 99% of gennin are children. And the 1 gennin we saw that was an adult was BULLIED AND LAUGHED AT by the ENTIRE VILLAGE. So no. I do not think thats the average ninja. \nI think your getting too political with this.

Naruto and Jiraiya have a habit of peeking into the showers. Gaara had his corpse desecrated. And last but certainly not least, Karin made multiple advances on Sasuke and at one point planned to drug Juugo and Suigetsu so she could \"ravage him\".",

Gai is literally like the master of taijustu or the best taijustsu user.Kakashi and Itachi are skilled taijustu users don\u2019t get me wrong but thats to be expected of all S class/ Kage level ninja. But they both are not taijustu users and usually use justu\u2019s. Itachi has rarely actually shown feats of him using hand to hand combat. I would argue that Kakashi is a better Tai justu user than Itachi just because he has more feats and was fighting Hidan with a fucking Kunai. Itachi is a Genjustu master above almost everything, like taking away his Genjustu would be like taking away 50% of his arsenal lmao",

If you think the average ninja is a genning then that just makes my point more valid.\n\nBut im going to just agree to disagree. I agree with some of what you said and disagree with other things. And it would take way too long to point out each thing i dont agree with. Plus english doesnt seem like your best language. \nEither way from what ive seen in the show. 99% of gennin are children. And the 1 gennin we saw that was an adult was BULLIED AND LAUGHED AT by the ENTIRE VILLAGE. So no. I do not think thats the average ninja. \nI think your getting too political with this.

Naruto and Jiraiya have a habit of peeking into the showers. Gaara had his corpse desecrated.

Even Chidori failed to penetrate it and wound A.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEveryone in part 1 that says Hiruzen is the strongest was a Konoha ninja or a former Konoha ninja his feats do not measure up.

They were saying that without a strong family line youd only make it to chunnin and i was saying thats not bad considering thats the average ninja. If you think the average ninja is a genning then that just makes my point more valid.\n\nBut im going to just agree to disagree. I agree with some of what you said and disagree with other things. And it would take way too long to point out each thing i dont agree with. Plus english doesnt seem like your best language. \nEither way from what ive seen in the show. 99% of gennin are children. And the 1 gennin we saw that was an adult was BULLIED AND LAUGHED AT by the ENTIRE VILLAGE. So no. I do not think thats the average ninja. \nI think your getting too political with this.

They were saying that without a strong family line youd only make it to chunnin and i was saying thats not bad considering thats the average ninja. If you think the average ninja is a genning then that just makes my point more valid.\n\nBut im going to just agree to disagree. I agree with some of what you said and disagree with other things. And it would take way too long to point out each thing i dont agree with. Plus english doesnt seem like your best language. \nEither way from what ive seen in the show. 99% of gennin are children. And the 1 gennin we saw that was an adult was BULLIED AND LAUGHED AT by the ENTIRE VILLAGE. So no. I do not think thats the average ninja. \nI think your getting too political with this.

One thing doesn't justify the other in absolutely any circumstances. I'd argue that this crime attempted **twice** by the cloud village is worse than anything that Danzo did.",

The manga outright shows and implies that this stuff happens multiple times. One of the teachers for the chuunin exams had a head full of holes and scars left from being brutally tortured. Naruto and Jiraiya have a habit of peeking into the showers. Gaara had his corpse desecrated. And last but certainly not least, Karin made multiple advances on Sasuke and at one point planned to drug Juugo and Suigetsu so she could \"ravage him\".",

That\u2019s why 3 of the other 4 major villages got two instead of them all getting one along with some of the minor villages.",

And it would take way too long to point out each thing i dont agree with. Plus english doesnt seem like your best language. \nEither way from what ive seen in the show. 99% of gennin are children.

Naruto and Jiraiya have a habit of peeking into the showers. Gaara had his corpse desecrated.

Sasuke is uchiha clan, descendant of six path immortal\n\nNaruro friend is a ninja clan with strong heritage. In a real world, Hyuga and Uchiha is a royal family. Sarutobi is a goverment family like Bush family. Nara clan is rich family like Walton family.\n\nFive hidden village is a superpower level, with Konoha equal to USA and other village equal to China, Russia, Europe and Arab.\n\nThey are not the average. The average ninja barely scrab by and survive. This is why Nagato hate five hidden village. Because small country can only be a victim of war between major country",
