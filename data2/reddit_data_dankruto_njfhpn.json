Otherwise the hole should be the same size since it\u2019s the same chicory in both cases.

But to your point looking back they are different jutsus used for different purposes. Chidori being used to assassinate and rasengan used for raw base power, so thank you for some different insight. If Sasuke pierces Naruto's heart doesn't matter how much power he has in that rasengan\n\nBut I would counter that, at that age, as proven by his reaction to the damages of the water towers, Sasuke was not acting on the advantage of his chidori in that situation and had no intention of strategically using it. It was simply I am stronger therefore my jutsus is stronger. They both had this mentality. There was just no utilizing the subtleties required in using jutsus like that to their fullest potential, or at least in this specific situation.",

This only fueled his desire to leave the village in search for power.\n\nSo my point is that Kishimoto *wanted* to showcase that Naruto had become so strong that Sasuke should be worried.\n\nAnd as someone else already said too, if Chidor is not meant for raw clash and impact, that just proved that in a head-to-head clash with the rasengan, the rasengan will overpower it since it's made for this purpose, the only exception being if the chidori wielder is more skilled than the rasengan wielder, which was kind of what happened at the valley of the end imo.\n\nAs for the Gaara point, yes i agree that it's a bit absurd that Naruto took down a tailed beast with merely a summoning jutsu and kyuubi chakra mode (not even 1 tails)",

He wanted to show that Naruto had become strong enough for Sasuke to worry, and he succeeded in doing that.\n\n> Expect every time they clashed it ended in a tie\n\nThat's because Cursed Mark stage 2 Sasuke was stronger than 1 tails Naruto (plus the chidori he used there was a modified version, probably more suited for raw clashes). And in the shipudden fight, Sasuke harnessed chakra from all of the tailed beasts, while Naruto just had one half of Kurama, so...",

You make sense - I don't fully agree with you, I think Chidori being a concentrated point of piercing jutsu would lose to a raw power based jutsu since Naruto  has way more chakra at that point than Sasuke. Chidori just isn't a head-on kind of attack, you don't want to clash - you want to blitz.\n\nBut you made good points and water tanks definitely don't mean that Sasuke was weaker in general.\n\nFor those who wonder why - Rasengan spins and rotates chakra (and anything that comes into contact - it's clearly visable for example when he made contact during first Kabuto fight) . Naruto attacking water tank is basically the same thing as him passing first Rasengan test - popping the baloon. Spin water very fast until it explodes.",

There is no 100% answer because they didn't clash. You could argue that Kakashi stopped them because he knew somebody would win, because he knows both jutsus. If they were going to tie, why would he stop (this is obviously saying \"maybes\" so take it with a pinch of salt). For me it's implied that Naruto would win this particular clash and it's okay for you to think differently.\n\nSecond part is straight up not true. Uchihas were said to have a large chakra reserves in comparison to regular (garbage) ninjas. Uzumakis have been said to have enormous chakra reserves, Kushina was chosen as a jinchuuriki (and those were usually chosen because of their extraordinary chakra reserves even among Uzumakis), he was able to learn sage mode which again needs huge reserves and finally - Kakashi said at the time that he can use Chidori 2-3 times a day, Sasuke could use it 1-2 times and Kakashi said himself that his chakra reserves are really modest in comparison to kid Naruto.",

In a fit of rage, he realizes that Naruto would've won and decided staying at Konohagakure isn't going to be the best way to get strong enough to beat Itachi.\n\nIf you take in all that, and especially Orochimaru's curse mark, of course Sasuke is going to see the rasengan feat as an indication that he has fallen behind.",

Otherwise the hole should be the same size since it\u2019s the same chicory in both cases. Also what kakashi said is true, he looked like he was trying to kill naruto but that doesn\u2019t mean he would of succeeded. I could try to kill mike Tyson with my fist but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019d succeed. Also I don\u2019t think the last link proves either side.",

Chidori should never make a big as hole unless used incorrectly. But this was more to show how Itachi really fucked Sasuke mind up making him feel weak as shit.\n\nAnd i don't believe he would've killed Naruto, we saw the outcome of their clash in the waves, it was a tie.

But to your point looking back they are different jutsus used for different purposes. Chidori being used to assassinate and rasengan used for raw base power, so thank you for some different insight. If Sasuke pierces Naruto's heart doesn't matter how much power he has in that rasengan\n\nBut I would counter that, at that age, as proven by his reaction to the damages of the water towers, Sasuke was not acting on the advantage of his chidori in that situation and had no intention of strategically using it. It was simply I am stronger therefore my jutsus is stronger. They both had this mentality. There was just no utilizing the subtleties required in using jutsus like that to their fullest potential, or at least in this specific situation.",

This only fueled his desire to leave the village in search for power.\n\nSo my point is that Kishimoto *wanted* to showcase that Naruto had become so strong that Sasuke should be worried.\n\nAnd as someone else already said too, if Chidor is not meant for raw clash and impact, that just proved that in a head-to-head clash with the rasengan, the rasengan will overpower it since it's made for this purpose, the only exception being if the chidori wielder is more skilled than the rasengan wielder, which was kind of what happened at the valley of the end imo.\n\nAs for the Gaara point, yes i agree that it's a bit absurd that Naruto took down a tailed beast with merely a summoning jutsu and kyuubi chakra mode (not even 1 tails)",

If you compare the damage both of them did on the water tower, it's obvious the rasengan would've overpowered the chidori. And others have already said all this, Kakashi/Jiraiya also commented that Sasuke could've been killed had kakashi not interrupted. \n\nThe valley of the end battle is different, Sasuke had the Curse Mark Stage 2 and Naruto had 1 tail kyuubi cloak at that point, it's a different argument.",

You make sense - I don't fully agree with you, I think Chidori being a concentrated point of piercing jutsu would lose to a raw power based jutsu since Naruto  has way more chakra at that point than Sasuke. Chidori just isn't a head-on kind of attack, you don't want to clash - you want to blitz.\n\nBut you made good points and water tanks definitely don't mean that Sasuke was weaker in general.\n\nFor those who wonder why - Rasengan spins and rotates chakra (and anything that comes into contact - it's clearly visable for example when he made contact during first Kabuto fight) . Naruto attacking water tank is basically the same thing as him passing first Rasengan test - popping the baloon. Spin water very fast until it explodes.",

There is no 100% answer because they didn't clash. You could argue that Kakashi stopped them because he knew somebody would win, because he knows both jutsus. If they were going to tie, why would he stop (this is obviously saying \"maybes\" so take it with a pinch of salt). For me it's implied that Naruto would win this particular clash and it's okay for you to think differently.\n\nSecond part is straight up not true. Uchihas were said to have a large chakra reserves in comparison to regular (garbage) ninjas. Uzumakis have been said to have enormous chakra reserves, Kushina was chosen as a jinchuuriki (and those were usually chosen because of their extraordinary chakra reserves even among Uzumakis), he was able to learn sage mode which again needs huge reserves and finally - Kakashi said at the time that he can use Chidori 2-3 times a day, Sasuke could use it 1-2 times and Kakashi said himself that his chakra reserves are really modest in comparison to kid Naruto.",

In a fit of rage, he realizes that Naruto would've won and decided staying at Konohagakure isn't going to be the best way to get strong enough to beat Itachi.\n\nIf you take in all that, and especially Orochimaru's curse mark, of course Sasuke is going to see the rasengan feat as an indication that he has fallen behind.",

Otherwise the hole should be the same size since it\u2019s the same chicory in both cases. Also what kakashi said is true, he looked like he was trying to kill naruto but that doesn\u2019t mean he would of succeeded.

But to your point looking back they are different jutsus used for different purposes. Chidori being used to assassinate and rasengan used for raw base power, so thank you for some different insight. If Sasuke pierces Naruto's heart doesn't matter how much power he has in that rasengan\n\nBut I would counter that, at that age, as proven by his reaction to the damages of the water towers, Sasuke was not acting on the advantage of his chidori in that situation and had no intention of strategically using it. It was simply I am stronger therefore my jutsus is stronger. They both had this mentality. There was just no utilizing the subtleties required in using jutsus like that to their fullest potential, or at least in this specific situation.",

This only fueled his desire to leave the village in search for power.\n\nSo my point is that Kishimoto *wanted* to showcase that Naruto had become so strong that Sasuke should be worried.\n\nAnd as someone else already said too, if Chidor is not meant for raw clash and impact, that just proved that in a head-to-head clash with the rasengan, the rasengan will overpower it since it's made for this purpose, the only exception being if the chidori wielder is more skilled than the rasengan wielder, which was kind of what happened at the valley of the end imo.\n\nAs for the Gaara point, yes i agree that it's a bit absurd that Naruto took down a tailed beast with merely a summoning jutsu and kyuubi chakra mode (not even 1 tails)",

And in the shipudden fight, Sasuke harnessed chakra from all of the tailed beasts, while Naruto just had one half of Kurama, so...",

You make sense - I don't fully agree with you, I think Chidori being a concentrated point of piercing jutsu would lose to a raw power based jutsu since Naruto  has way more chakra at that point than Sasuke. Chidori just isn't a head-on kind of attack, you don't want to clash - you want to blitz.\n\nBut you made good points and water tanks definitely don't mean that Sasuke was weaker in general.\n\nFor those who wonder why - Rasengan spins and rotates chakra (and anything that comes into contact - it's clearly visable for example when he made contact during first Kabuto fight) . Naruto attacking water tank is basically the same thing as him passing first Rasengan test - popping the baloon. Spin water very fast until it explodes.",

There is no 100% answer because they didn't clash. You could argue that Kakashi stopped them because he knew somebody would win, because he knows both jutsus. If they were going to tie, why would he stop (this is obviously saying \"maybes\" so take it with a pinch of salt). For me it's implied that Naruto would win this particular clash and it's okay for you to think differently.\n\nSecond part is straight up not true. Uchihas were said to have a large chakra reserves in comparison to regular (garbage) ninjas. Uzumakis have been said to have enormous chakra reserves, Kushina was chosen as a jinchuuriki (and those were usually chosen because of their extraordinary chakra reserves even among Uzumakis), he was able to learn sage mode which again needs huge reserves and finally - Kakashi said at the time that he can use Chidori 2-3 times a day, Sasuke could use it 1-2 times and Kakashi said himself that his chakra reserves are really modest in comparison to kid Naruto.",

But to your point looking back they are different jutsus used for different purposes. Chidori being used to assassinate and rasengan used for raw base power, so thank you for some different insight. If Sasuke pierces Naruto's heart doesn't matter how much power he has in that rasengan\n\nBut I would counter that, at that age, as proven by his reaction to the damages of the water towers, Sasuke was not acting on the advantage of his chidori in that situation and had no intention of strategically using it. It was simply I am stronger therefore my jutsus is stronger. They both had this mentality. There was just no utilizing the subtleties required in using jutsus like that to their fullest potential, or at least in this specific situation.",

This only fueled his desire to leave the village in search for power.\n\nSo my point is that Kishimoto *wanted* to showcase that Naruto had become so strong that Sasuke should be worried.\n\nAnd as someone else already said too, if Chidor is not meant for raw clash and impact, that just proved that in a head-to-head clash with the rasengan, the rasengan will overpower it since it's made for this purpose, the only exception being if the chidori wielder is more skilled than the rasengan wielder, which was kind of what happened at the valley of the end imo.\n\nAs for the Gaara point, yes i agree that it's a bit absurd that Naruto took down a tailed beast with merely a summoning jutsu and kyuubi chakra mode (not even 1 tails)",

There is no 100% answer because they didn't clash. You could argue that Kakashi stopped them because he knew somebody would win, because he knows both jutsus. If they were going to tie, why would he stop (this is obviously saying \"maybes\" so take it with a pinch of salt). For me it's implied that Naruto would win this particular clash and it's okay for you to think differently.\n\nSecond part is straight up not true. Uchihas were said to have a large chakra reserves in comparison to regular (garbage) ninjas. Uzumakis have been said to have enormous chakra reserves, Kushina was chosen as a jinchuuriki (and those were usually chosen because of their extraordinary chakra reserves even among Uzumakis), he was able to learn sage mode which again needs huge reserves and finally - Kakashi said at the time that he can use Chidori 2-3 times a day, Sasuke could use it 1-2 times and Kakashi said himself that his chakra reserves are really modest in comparison to kid Naruto.",

Otherwise the hole should be the same size since it\u2019s the same chicory in both cases. Also what kakashi said is true, he looked like he was trying to kill naruto but that doesn\u2019t mean he would of succeeded.

But to your point looking back they are different jutsus used for different purposes. Chidori being used to assassinate and rasengan used for raw base power, so thank you for some different insight. If Sasuke pierces Naruto's heart doesn't matter how much power he has in that rasengan\n\nBut I would counter that, at that age, as proven by his reaction to the damages of the water towers, Sasuke was not acting on the advantage of his chidori in that situation and had no intention of strategically using it. It was simply I am stronger therefore my jutsus is stronger. They both had this mentality. There was just no utilizing the subtleties required in using jutsus like that to their fullest potential, or at least in this specific situation.",

This only fueled his desire to leave the village in search for power.\n\nSo my point is that Kishimoto *wanted* to showcase that Naruto had become so strong that Sasuke should be worried.\n\nAnd as someone else already said too, if Chidor is not meant for raw clash and impact, that just proved that in a head-to-head clash with the rasengan, the rasengan will overpower it since it's made for this purpose, the only exception being if the chidori wielder is more skilled than the rasengan wielder, which was kind of what happened at the valley of the end imo.\n\nAs for the Gaara point, yes i agree that it's a bit absurd that Naruto took down a tailed beast with merely a summoning jutsu and kyuubi chakra mode (not even 1 tails)",

If they were going to tie, why would he stop (this is obviously saying \"maybes\" so take it with a pinch of salt). For me it's implied that Naruto would win this particular clash and it's okay for you to think differently.\n\nSecond part is straight up not true. Uchihas were said to have a large chakra reserves in comparison to regular (garbage) ninjas. Uzumakis have been said to have enormous chakra reserves, Kushina was chosen as a jinchuuriki (and those were usually chosen because of their extraordinary chakra reserves even among Uzumakis), he was able to learn sage mode which again needs huge reserves and finally - Kakashi said at the time that he can use Chidori 2-3 times a day, Sasuke could use it 1-2 times and Kakashi said himself that his chakra reserves are really modest in comparison to kid Naruto.",

You could argue that Kakashi stopped them because he knew somebody would win, because he knows both jutsus. If they were going to tie, why would he stop (this is obviously saying \"maybes\" so take it with a pinch of salt). For me it's implied that Naruto would win this particular clash and it's okay for you to think differently.\n\nSecond part is straight up not true. Uchihas were said to have a large chakra reserves in comparison to regular (garbage) ninjas. Uzumakis have been said to have enormous chakra reserves, Kushina was chosen as a jinchuuriki (and those were usually chosen because of their extraordinary chakra reserves even among Uzumakis), he was able to learn sage mode which again needs huge reserves and finally - Kakashi said at the time that he can use Chidori 2-3 times a day, Sasuke could use it 1-2 times and Kakashi said himself that his chakra reserves are really modest in comparison to kid Naruto.",

You could argue that Kakashi stopped them because he knew somebody would win, because he knows both jutsus. If they were going to tie, why would he stop (this is obviously saying \"maybes\" so take it with a pinch of salt). For me it's implied that Naruto would win this particular clash and it's okay for you to think differently.\n\nSecond part is straight up not true. Uchihas were said to have a large chakra reserves in comparison to regular (garbage) ninjas. Uzumakis have been said to have enormous chakra reserves, Kushina was chosen as a jinchuuriki (and those were usually chosen because of their extraordinary chakra reserves even among Uzumakis), he was able to learn sage mode which again needs huge reserves and finally - Kakashi said at the time that he can use Chidori 2-3 times a day, Sasuke could use it 1-2 times and Kakashi said himself that his chakra reserves are really modest in comparison to kid Naruto.",
