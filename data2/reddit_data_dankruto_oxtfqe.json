His wife dead, his hope and future of the village dead, his village destroyed and Hiruzen still preached no violence as always.

His wife dead, his hope and future of the village dead, his village destroyed and Hiruzen still preached no violence as always. Just for these Uchicha to read their precious altered tablet and play right into Zetsu's hands all over again. The Uchiha were suicidal and tools of Zetsu.
