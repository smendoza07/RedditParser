Imo the genjutsu and all that gray stuff still would've worked out in the end, if tobi hadn't interfered and survived the amaterasu. We saw how sasuke had the morals to not kill anyone except itachi until itachi's past was revealed.  So it's not weird to think sasuke would've returned to the leaf after that. So criticize itachi as much as you want but his plan was about to work out if not for tobi. The only odd thing is how long it would take sasuke to wake up from the genjutsu if tsunade didn't come.",

I think manipulating Hanzo to keep the War going was good for his character, he wants the Stone to be begging for peace so that the Leaf could hit them with reparations. What I hate was he took Shisui\u2019s eye after finding out about his plan to put genjutsu on Fugaku. Like he just removes an option for Peace for the Leaf out of distrust for Shisui. Really if there was bigger complicated plan that Danzo needed Shisui\u2019s eye for would have been better. Also how he keeps the root out of the nine tails attack was a bad move IMO. It would have contrasted well with how he stayed out of the Pain attack.",

It's all rinrinrinrinrin all when his mask falls off. He says he explored the world \"seeing evil\", but this is never seen.\n\nConsider effects of Rin dying for Obito to - effects of Yahiko dying to Nagato and Konan. They are the same thing, it changed his perspective about the world and started to believe in everything Madara said to him. Keep in mind that Obito's back story  was one of the most tragic ones, at least with Nagato he never get betrayed by his closest friends and Konan stayed with him whole time. Obito was a loner his whole life and he had nobody to love for that's why he decided his life to Madara's plan to create paradise. If Rin was all he cared about he could have just asked Nagato to revive her with rinnegan or use rinnegan to revive her by himself.",

I think you should consider the fact that Madara was the last person showed affection towards Obito and he convinced him that world is shit and infinite tsukuyomi would be only way to save it. Obito himself experienced the Ninja war and also felt betrayed by his closest friend. When Obito gets unmasked he talks about how absurd the current reality is. This is a man who gave up on this world and doesn't cares about reality anymore. He even let Kakashi stab him because he doesn't cares about pain or being alive. \n\n> Obito loses Rin and then....destroys his village\n\nEnd justify means for Obito and pretty much all Naruto villains. Taking 9 tails from a kid would have been a lot easier than Kushina who was strong ninja. \n\n> and genocides his clan?\n\nThey were gonna die either way because of Danzo, but if he helped Itachi he would gain super strong ally.

He was a child soldier in said war, and nearly died. \n\nHe was being manipulated by a God of Uchiha while recuperating for a long time, only to come back and see his best friend being killed. \n\nObito clearly states its the ninja world and system that gives rise to needless conflict and death. Rin was a symptom, not the cause. \n\nNagato being a pawn doesn\u2019t detract from the fact that Amegekure was a war torn shlthole. Obito was witness to that as well and it only confirmed his feelings about the ninja world being unsalvageable. \n\nIdrc if you want to label him as \u201cevil\u201d, that very well could be an accurate assessment, but he truly wanted to bring humanity under a genjutsu for the sake of peace. If he was selfish and only did it for Rin, a huge part of his character arc wouldn\u2019t be trying to break Naruto and also have him realize the world is hell. He wouldn\u2019t show Kakashi compassion and promote his infinite tsukiyomi ideal. \n\nNo, he truly believed in the infinite tsukiyomi for world peace. \n\nPain said that two major pains caused him to turn out the way he did. His parents and Yahiko. Does that mean that ONLY those were his motivation. Obviously not. That removes all context and nuance. The world itself, his upbringing, his experiences, all factor in. \n\nIf you wanna choose to ignore all that, that\u2019s on you",

Imo the genjutsu and all that gray stuff still would've worked out in the end, if tobi hadn't interfered and survived the amaterasu.

So criticize itachi as much as you want but his plan was about to work out if not for tobi. The only odd thing is how long it would take sasuke to wake up from the genjutsu if tsunade didn't come.",

I think manipulating Hanzo to keep the War going was good for his character, he wants the Stone to be begging for peace so that the Leaf could hit them with reparations. What I hate was he took Shisui\u2019s eye after finding out about his plan to put genjutsu on Fugaku. Like he just removes an option for Peace for the Leaf out of distrust for Shisui. Really if there was bigger complicated plan that Danzo needed Shisui\u2019s eye for would have been better. Also how he keeps the root out of the nine tails attack was a bad move IMO. It would have contrasted well with how he stayed out of the Pain attack.",

It's all rinrinrinrinrin all when his mask falls off. He says he explored the world \"seeing evil\", but this is never seen.\n\nConsider effects of Rin dying for Obito to - effects of Yahiko dying to Nagato and Konan. They are the same thing, it changed his perspective about the world and started to believe in everything Madara said to him. Keep in mind that Obito's back story  was one of the most tragic ones, at least with Nagato he never get betrayed by his closest friends and Konan stayed with him whole time. Obito was a loner his whole life and he had nobody to love for that's why he decided his life to Madara's plan to create paradise. If Rin was all he cared about he could have just asked Nagato to revive her with rinnegan or use rinnegan to revive her by himself.",

I think you should consider the fact that Madara was the last person showed affection towards Obito and he convinced him that world is shit and infinite tsukuyomi would be only way to save it. Obito himself experienced the Ninja war and also felt betrayed by his closest friend. When Obito gets unmasked he talks about how absurd the current reality is. This is a man who gave up on this world and doesn't cares about reality anymore. He even let Kakashi stab him because he doesn't cares about pain or being alive. \n\n> Obito loses Rin and then....destroys his village\n\nEnd justify means for Obito and pretty much all Naruto villains. Taking 9 tails from a kid would have been a lot easier than Kushina who was strong ninja. \n\n> and genocides his clan?\n\nThey were gonna die either way because of Danzo, but if he helped Itachi he would gain super strong ally.

He was a child soldier in said war, and nearly died. \n\nHe was being manipulated by a God of Uchiha while recuperating for a long time, only to come back and see his best friend being killed. \n\nObito clearly states its the ninja world and system that gives rise to needless conflict and death. Rin was a symptom, not the cause. \n\nNagato being a pawn doesn\u2019t detract from the fact that Amegekure was a war torn shlthole. Obito was witness to that as well and it only confirmed his feelings about the ninja world being unsalvageable. \n\nIdrc if you want to label him as \u201cevil\u201d, that very well could be an accurate assessment, but he truly wanted to bring humanity under a genjutsu for the sake of peace. If he was selfish and only did it for Rin, a huge part of his character arc wouldn\u2019t be trying to break Naruto and also have him realize the world is hell. He wouldn\u2019t show Kakashi compassion and promote his infinite tsukiyomi ideal. \n\nNo, he truly believed in the infinite tsukiyomi for world peace. \n\nPain said that two major pains caused him to turn out the way he did. His parents and Yahiko. Does that mean that ONLY those were his motivation. Obviously not. That removes all context and nuance. The world itself, his upbringing, his experiences, all factor in. \n\nIf you wanna choose to ignore all that, that\u2019s on you",

Imo the genjutsu and all that gray stuff still would've worked out in the end, if tobi hadn't interfered and survived the amaterasu. We saw how sasuke had the morals to not kill anyone except itachi until itachi's past was revealed.  So it's not weird to think sasuke would've returned to the leaf after that. So criticize itachi as much as you want but his plan was about to work out if not for tobi. The only odd thing is how long it would take sasuke to wake up from the genjutsu if tsunade didn't come.",

I think manipulating Hanzo to keep the War going was good for his character, he wants the Stone to be begging for peace so that the Leaf could hit them with reparations. What I hate was he took Shisui\u2019s eye after finding out about his plan to put genjutsu on Fugaku. Like he just removes an option for Peace for the Leaf out of distrust for Shisui. Really if there was bigger complicated plan that Danzo needed Shisui\u2019s eye for would have been better. Also how he keeps the root out of the nine tails attack was a bad move IMO. It would have contrasted well with how he stayed out of the Pain attack.",

It's all rinrinrinrinrin all when his mask falls off. He says he explored the world \"seeing evil\", but this is never seen.\n\nConsider effects of Rin dying for Obito to - effects of Yahiko dying to Nagato and Konan. They are the same thing, it changed his perspective about the world and started to believe in everything Madara said to him. Keep in mind that Obito's back story  was one of the most tragic ones, at least with Nagato he never get betrayed by his closest friends and Konan stayed with him whole time. Obito was a loner his whole life and he had nobody to love for that's why he decided his life to Madara's plan to create paradise. If Rin was all he cared about he could have just asked Nagato to revive her with rinnegan or use rinnegan to revive her by himself.",

He had Rin, Minato, and he was well liked around his clan for helping people.\n\nKakashi still had people around him that showed friendship & love to him, Obito had nobody. I think you should consider the fact that Madara was the last person showed affection towards Obito and he convinced him that world is shit and infinite tsukuyomi would be only way to save it. Obito himself experienced the Ninja war and also felt betrayed by his closest friend. When Obito gets unmasked he talks about how absurd the current reality is. This is a man who gave up on this world and doesn't cares about reality anymore. He even let Kakashi stab him because he doesn't cares about pain or being alive. \n\n> Obito loses Rin and then....destroys his village\n\nEnd justify means for Obito and pretty much all Naruto villains. Taking 9 tails from a kid would have been a lot easier than Kushina who was strong ninja. \n\n> and genocides his clan?\n\nThey were gonna die either way because of Danzo, but if he helped Itachi he would gain super strong ally.

He told Rin he wanted to become Hokage and end the war. He was a child soldier in said war, and nearly died. \n\nHe was being manipulated by a God of Uchiha while recuperating for a long time, only to come back and see his best friend being killed. \n\nObito clearly states its the ninja world and system that gives rise to needless conflict and death. Rin was a symptom, not the cause. \n\nNagato being a pawn doesn\u2019t detract from the fact that Amegekure was a war torn shlthole. Obito was witness to that as well and it only confirmed his feelings about the ninja world being unsalvageable. \n\nIdrc if you want to label him as \u201cevil\u201d, that very well could be an accurate assessment, but he truly wanted to bring humanity under a genjutsu for the sake of peace. If he was selfish and only did it for Rin, a huge part of his character arc wouldn\u2019t be trying to break Naruto and also have him realize the world is hell. He wouldn\u2019t show Kakashi compassion and promote his infinite tsukiyomi ideal. \n\nNo, he truly believed in the infinite tsukiyomi for world peace. \n\nPain said that two major pains caused him to turn out the way he did. His parents and Yahiko. Does that mean that ONLY those were his motivation. Obviously not. That removes all context and nuance. The world itself, his upbringing, his experiences, all factor in. \n\nIf you wanna choose to ignore all that, that\u2019s on you",

We saw how sasuke had the morals to not kill anyone except itachi until itachi's past was revealed.  So it's not weird to think sasuke would've returned to the leaf after that. So criticize itachi as much as you want but his plan was about to work out if not for tobi. The only odd thing is how long it would take sasuke to wake up from the genjutsu if tsunade didn't come.",

I think manipulating Hanzo to keep the War going was good for his character, he wants the Stone to be begging for peace so that the Leaf could hit them with reparations. What I hate was he took Shisui\u2019s eye after finding out about his plan to put genjutsu on Fugaku. Like he just removes an option for Peace for the Leaf out of distrust for Shisui. Really if there was bigger complicated plan that Danzo needed Shisui\u2019s eye for would have been better. Also how he keeps the root out of the nine tails attack was a bad move IMO. It would have contrasted well with how he stayed out of the Pain attack.",

Keep in mind that Obito's back story  was one of the most tragic ones, at least with Nagato he never get betrayed by his closest friends and Konan stayed with him whole time. Obito was a loner his whole life and he had nobody to love for that's why he decided his life to Madara's plan to create paradise.

I think you should consider the fact that Madara was the last person showed affection towards Obito and he convinced him that world is shit and infinite tsukuyomi would be only way to save it. Obito himself experienced the Ninja war and also felt betrayed by his closest friend. When Obito gets unmasked he talks about how absurd the current reality is. This is a man who gave up on this world and doesn't cares about reality anymore. He even let Kakashi stab him because he doesn't cares about pain or being alive. \n\n> Obito loses Rin and then....destroys his village\n\nEnd justify means for Obito and pretty much all Naruto villains. Taking 9 tails from a kid would have been a lot easier than Kushina who was strong ninja. \n\n> and genocides his clan?\n\nThey were gonna die either way because of Danzo, but if he helped Itachi he would gain super strong ally.

He was a child soldier in said war, and nearly died. \n\nHe was being manipulated by a God of Uchiha while recuperating for a long time, only to come back and see his best friend being killed. \n\nObito clearly states its the ninja world and system that gives rise to needless conflict and death. Rin was a symptom, not the cause. \n\nNagato being a pawn doesn\u2019t detract from the fact that Amegekure was a war torn shlthole. Obito was witness to that as well and it only confirmed his feelings about the ninja world being unsalvageable. \n\nIdrc if you want to label him as \u201cevil\u201d, that very well could be an accurate assessment, but he truly wanted to bring humanity under a genjutsu for the sake of peace. If he was selfish and only did it for Rin, a huge part of his character arc wouldn\u2019t be trying to break Naruto and also have him realize the world is hell. He wouldn\u2019t show Kakashi compassion and promote his infinite tsukiyomi ideal. \n\nNo, he truly believed in the infinite tsukiyomi for world peace. \n\nPain said that two major pains caused him to turn out the way he did. His parents and Yahiko. Does that mean that ONLY those were his motivation. Obviously not. That removes all context and nuance. The world itself, his upbringing, his experiences, all factor in. \n\nIf you wanna choose to ignore all that, that\u2019s on you",

What I hate was he took Shisui\u2019s eye after finding out about his plan to put genjutsu on Fugaku. Like he just removes an option for Peace for the Leaf out of distrust for Shisui. Really if there was bigger complicated plan that Danzo needed Shisui\u2019s eye for would have been better. Also how he keeps the root out of the nine tails attack was a bad move IMO. It would have contrasted well with how he stayed out of the Pain attack.",

They are the same thing, it changed his perspective about the world and started to believe in everything Madara said to him. Keep in mind that Obito's back story  was one of the most tragic ones, at least with Nagato he never get betrayed by his closest friends and Konan stayed with him whole time. Obito was a loner his whole life and he had nobody to love for that's why he decided his life to Madara's plan to create paradise. If Rin was all he cared about he could have just asked Nagato to revive her with rinnegan or use rinnegan to revive her by himself.",

I think you should consider the fact that Madara was the last person showed affection towards Obito and he convinced him that world is shit and infinite tsukuyomi would be only way to save it. Obito himself experienced the Ninja war and also felt betrayed by his closest friend. When Obito gets unmasked he talks about how absurd the current reality is. This is a man who gave up on this world and doesn't cares about reality anymore. He even let Kakashi stab him because he doesn't cares about pain or being alive. \n\n> Obito loses Rin and then....destroys his village\n\nEnd justify means for Obito and pretty much all Naruto villains. Taking 9 tails from a kid would have been a lot easier than Kushina who was strong ninja. \n\n> and genocides his clan?\n\nThey were gonna die either way because of Danzo, but if he helped Itachi he would gain super strong ally.

He told Rin he wanted to become Hokage and end the war. He was a child soldier in said war, and nearly died. \n\nHe was being manipulated by a God of Uchiha while recuperating for a long time, only to come back and see his best friend being killed. \n\nObito clearly states its the ninja world and system that gives rise to needless conflict and death. Rin was a symptom, not the cause. \n\nNagato being a pawn doesn\u2019t detract from the fact that Amegekure was a war torn shlthole. Obito was witness to that as well and it only confirmed his feelings about the ninja world being unsalvageable. \n\nIdrc if you want to label him as \u201cevil\u201d, that very well could be an accurate assessment, but he truly wanted to bring humanity under a genjutsu for the sake of peace. If he was selfish and only did it for Rin, a huge part of his character arc wouldn\u2019t be trying to break Naruto and also have him realize the world is hell. He wouldn\u2019t show Kakashi compassion and promote his infinite tsukiyomi ideal. \n\nNo, he truly believed in the infinite tsukiyomi for world peace. \n\nPain said that two major pains caused him to turn out the way he did. His parents and Yahiko. Does that mean that ONLY those were his motivation. Obviously not. That removes all context and nuance. The world itself, his upbringing, his experiences, all factor in. \n\nIf you wanna choose to ignore all that, that\u2019s on you",

I think manipulating Hanzo to keep the War going was good for his character, he wants the Stone to be begging for peace so that the Leaf could hit them with reparations. What I hate was he took Shisui\u2019s eye after finding out about his plan to put genjutsu on Fugaku. Like he just removes an option for Peace for the Leaf out of distrust for Shisui. Really if there was bigger complicated plan that Danzo needed Shisui\u2019s eye for would have been better. Also how he keeps the root out of the nine tails attack was a bad move IMO. It would have contrasted well with how he stayed out of the Pain attack.",

It's all rinrinrinrinrin all when his mask falls off. He says he explored the world \"seeing evil\", but this is never seen.\n\nConsider effects of Rin dying for Obito to - effects of Yahiko dying to Nagato and Konan. They are the same thing, it changed his perspective about the world and started to believe in everything Madara said to him. Keep in mind that Obito's back story  was one of the most tragic ones, at least with Nagato he never get betrayed by his closest friends and Konan stayed with him whole time. Obito was a loner his whole life and he had nobody to love for that's why he decided his life to Madara's plan to create paradise. If Rin was all he cared about he could have just asked Nagato to revive her with rinnegan or use rinnegan to revive her by himself.",

I think you should consider the fact that Madara was the last person showed affection towards Obito and he convinced him that world is shit and infinite tsukuyomi would be only way to save it. Obito himself experienced the Ninja war and also felt betrayed by his closest friend. When Obito gets unmasked he talks about how absurd the current reality is. This is a man who gave up on this world and doesn't cares about reality anymore. He even let Kakashi stab him because he doesn't cares about pain or being alive. \n\n> Obito loses Rin and then....destroys his village\n\nEnd justify means for Obito and pretty much all Naruto villains. Taking 9 tails from a kid would have been a lot easier than Kushina who was strong ninja. \n\n> and genocides his clan?\n\nThey were gonna die either way because of Danzo, but if he helped Itachi he would gain super strong ally.

He was a child soldier in said war, and nearly died. \n\nHe was being manipulated by a God of Uchiha while recuperating for a long time, only to come back and see his best friend being killed. \n\nObito clearly states its the ninja world and system that gives rise to needless conflict and death. Rin was a symptom, not the cause. \n\nNagato being a pawn doesn\u2019t detract from the fact that Amegekure was a war torn shlthole. Obito was witness to that as well and it only confirmed his feelings about the ninja world being unsalvageable. \n\nIdrc if you want to label him as \u201cevil\u201d, that very well could be an accurate assessment, but he truly wanted to bring humanity under a genjutsu for the sake of peace. If he was selfish and only did it for Rin, a huge part of his character arc wouldn\u2019t be trying to break Naruto and also have him realize the world is hell. He wouldn\u2019t show Kakashi compassion and promote his infinite tsukiyomi ideal. \n\nNo, he truly believed in the infinite tsukiyomi for world peace. \n\nPain said that two major pains caused him to turn out the way he did. His parents and Yahiko. Does that mean that ONLY those were his motivation. Obviously not. That removes all context and nuance. The world itself, his upbringing, his experiences, all factor in. \n\nIf you wanna choose to ignore all that, that\u2019s on you",

I think manipulating Hanzo to keep the War going was good for his character, he wants the Stone to be begging for peace so that the Leaf could hit them with reparations. What I hate was he took Shisui\u2019s eye after finding out about his plan to put genjutsu on Fugaku. Like he just removes an option for Peace for the Leaf out of distrust for Shisui. Really if there was bigger complicated plan that Danzo needed Shisui\u2019s eye for would have been better. Also how he keeps the root out of the nine tails attack was a bad move IMO. It would have contrasted well with how he stayed out of the Pain attack.",

Keep in mind that Obito's back story  was one of the most tragic ones, at least with Nagato he never get betrayed by his closest friends and Konan stayed with him whole time. Obito was a loner his whole life and he had nobody to love for that's why he decided his life to Madara's plan to create paradise. If Rin was all he cared about he could have just asked Nagato to revive her with rinnegan or use rinnegan to revive her by himself.",

I think you should consider the fact that Madara was the last person showed affection towards Obito and he convinced him that world is shit and infinite tsukuyomi would be only way to save it. Obito himself experienced the Ninja war and also felt betrayed by his closest friend. When Obito gets unmasked he talks about how absurd the current reality is. This is a man who gave up on this world and doesn't cares about reality anymore. He even let Kakashi stab him because he doesn't cares about pain or being alive. \n\n> Obito loses Rin and then....destroys his village\n\nEnd justify means for Obito and pretty much all Naruto villains. Taking 9 tails from a kid would have been a lot easier than Kushina who was strong ninja. \n\n> and genocides his clan?\n\nThey were gonna die either way because of Danzo, but if he helped Itachi he would gain super strong ally.

Even Yahiko knew he was shady as Hell. The dude literally reigned Amegakure in the shadows and committed genocide in the leaf. \n\nDude WAS evil, he didn't see any besides Rin's death. He calls her his sole light and says when she dies the world was Hell. His motivation was Rin, period.",

He told Rin he wanted to become Hokage and end the war. He was a child soldier in said war, and nearly died. \n\nHe was being manipulated by a God of Uchiha while recuperating for a long time, only to come back and see his best friend being killed. \n\nObito clearly states its the ninja world and system that gives rise to needless conflict and death. Rin was a symptom, not the cause. \n\nNagato being a pawn doesn\u2019t detract from the fact that Amegekure was a war torn shlthole. Obito was witness to that as well and it only confirmed his feelings about the ninja world being unsalvageable. \n\nIdrc if you want to label him as \u201cevil\u201d, that very well could be an accurate assessment, but he truly wanted to bring humanity under a genjutsu for the sake of peace. If he was selfish and only did it for Rin, a huge part of his character arc wouldn\u2019t be trying to break Naruto and also have him realize the world is hell. He wouldn\u2019t show Kakashi compassion and promote his infinite tsukiyomi ideal. \n\nNo, he truly believed in the infinite tsukiyomi for world peace. \n\nPain said that two major pains caused him to turn out the way he did. His parents and Yahiko. Does that mean that ONLY those were his motivation. Obviously not. That removes all context and nuance. The world itself, his upbringing, his experiences, all factor in. \n\nIf you wanna choose to ignore all that, that\u2019s on you",

I think manipulating Hanzo to keep the War going was good for his character, he wants the Stone to be begging for peace so that the Leaf could hit them with reparations. What I hate was he took Shisui\u2019s eye after finding out about his plan to put genjutsu on Fugaku. Like he just removes an option for Peace for the Leaf out of distrust for Shisui. Really if there was bigger complicated plan that Danzo needed Shisui\u2019s eye for would have been better. Also how he keeps the root out of the nine tails attack was a bad move IMO. It would have contrasted well with how he stayed out of the Pain attack.",

I think you should consider the fact that Madara was the last person showed affection towards Obito and he convinced him that world is shit and infinite tsukuyomi would be only way to save it. Obito himself experienced the Ninja war and also felt betrayed by his closest friend. When Obito gets unmasked he talks about how absurd the current reality is. This is a man who gave up on this world and doesn't cares about reality anymore. He even let Kakashi stab him because he doesn't cares about pain or being alive. \n\n> Obito loses Rin and then....destroys his village\n\nEnd justify means for Obito and pretty much all Naruto villains. Taking 9 tails from a kid would have been a lot easier than Kushina who was strong ninja. \n\n> and genocides his clan?\n\nThey were gonna die either way because of Danzo, but if he helped Itachi he would gain super strong ally.

He told Rin he wanted to become Hokage and end the war. He was a child soldier in said war, and nearly died. \n\nHe was being manipulated by a God of Uchiha while recuperating for a long time, only to come back and see his best friend being killed. \n\nObito clearly states its the ninja world and system that gives rise to needless conflict and death. Rin was a symptom, not the cause. \n\nNagato being a pawn doesn\u2019t detract from the fact that Amegekure was a war torn shlthole. Obito was witness to that as well and it only confirmed his feelings about the ninja world being unsalvageable. \n\nIdrc if you want to label him as \u201cevil\u201d, that very well could be an accurate assessment, but he truly wanted to bring humanity under a genjutsu for the sake of peace. If he was selfish and only did it for Rin, a huge part of his character arc wouldn\u2019t be trying to break Naruto and also have him realize the world is hell. He wouldn\u2019t show Kakashi compassion and promote his infinite tsukiyomi ideal. \n\nNo, he truly believed in the infinite tsukiyomi for world peace. \n\nPain said that two major pains caused him to turn out the way he did. His parents and Yahiko. Does that mean that ONLY those were his motivation. Obviously not. That removes all context and nuance. The world itself, his upbringing, his experiences, all factor in. \n\nIf you wanna choose to ignore all that, that\u2019s on you",

What I hate was he took Shisui\u2019s eye after finding out about his plan to put genjutsu on Fugaku. Like he just removes an option for Peace for the Leaf out of distrust for Shisui. Really if there was bigger complicated plan that Danzo needed Shisui\u2019s eye for would have been better. Also how he keeps the root out of the nine tails attack was a bad move IMO. It would have contrasted well with how he stayed out of the Pain attack.",

He had Rin, Minato, and he was well liked around his clan for helping people.\n\nKakashi still had people around him that showed friendship & love to him, Obito had nobody. I think you should consider the fact that Madara was the last person showed affection towards Obito and he convinced him that world is shit and infinite tsukuyomi would be only way to save it. Obito himself experienced the Ninja war and also felt betrayed by his closest friend. When Obito gets unmasked he talks about how absurd the current reality is. This is a man who gave up on this world and doesn't cares about reality anymore. He even let Kakashi stab him because he doesn't cares about pain or being alive. \n\n> Obito loses Rin and then....destroys his village\n\nEnd justify means for Obito and pretty much all Naruto villains. Taking 9 tails from a kid would have been a lot easier than Kushina who was strong ninja. \n\n> and genocides his clan?\n\nThey were gonna die either way because of Danzo, but if he helped Itachi he would gain super strong ally. Why not?",

He told Rin he wanted to become Hokage and end the war. He was a child soldier in said war, and nearly died. \n\nHe was being manipulated by a God of Uchiha while recuperating for a long time, only to come back and see his best friend being killed. \n\nObito clearly states its the ninja world and system that gives rise to needless conflict and death. Rin was a symptom, not the cause. \n\nNagato being a pawn doesn\u2019t detract from the fact that Amegekure was a war torn shlthole. Obito was witness to that as well and it only confirmed his feelings about the ninja world being unsalvageable. \n\nIdrc if you want to label him as \u201cevil\u201d, that very well could be an accurate assessment, but he truly wanted to bring humanity under a genjutsu for the sake of peace. If he was selfish and only did it for Rin, a huge part of his character arc wouldn\u2019t be trying to break Naruto and also have him realize the world is hell. He wouldn\u2019t show Kakashi compassion and promote his infinite tsukiyomi ideal. \n\nNo, he truly believed in the infinite tsukiyomi for world peace. \n\nPain said that two major pains caused him to turn out the way he did. His parents and Yahiko. Does that mean that ONLY those were his motivation. Obviously not. That removes all context and nuance. The world itself, his upbringing, his experiences, all factor in. \n\nIf you wanna choose to ignore all that, that\u2019s on you",
