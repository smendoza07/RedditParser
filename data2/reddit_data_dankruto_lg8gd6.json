I guess it really depends on where you look in the series. To say that either is generally just \u201ccheap orange juice\u201d is a bit dishonest (but that\u2019s still your opinion). Filler doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the series, that\u2019s just from studios needing to keep interest in a series while they await new material to adapt. If you think your experience with either was tarnished by fillers, you should read the manga",

I guess it really depends on where you look in the series. To say that either is generally just \u201ccheap orange juice\u201d is a bit dishonest (but that\u2019s still your opinion). Filler doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the series, that\u2019s just from studios needing to keep interest in a series while they await new material to adapt. If you think your experience with either was tarnished by fillers, you should read the manga",

I guess it really depends on where you look in the series. To say that either is generally just \u201ccheap orange juice\u201d is a bit dishonest (but that\u2019s still your opinion). Filler doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the series, that\u2019s just from studios needing to keep interest in a series while they await new material to adapt. If you think your experience with either was tarnished by fillers, you should read the manga",
