    "body": "My SD is currently in the hospital unconscious. I wasn't given much information on how it happened or when it happened or what condition he is in. I'm just terribly heartbroken. He was one of my best friends and was always there for me when I needed a shoulder to cry on. He is such a sweet man, just send me all the good vibes so this man can heal and come back to his normal happy self.\n\n****UPDATE: I was finally able to visit him today, although he is still unconscious. I walked in and barely recognized him, his face was beat up, he had a neck brace on, tubes flowing out of his mouth, and a portion of his head was shaven so they could bolt in an IV. My poor man, I started bawling when I saw him and couldn't stop for a long while. The nurses informed me of what happened. This adventurous man, lives like he is 25 still, was riding a public scooter downtown (we call them birds) he was going really fast down a hill and lost control and hit his head really hard, he has a TBI. We actually talked about riding them one night before the accident, I told him I was nervous I'd fall off and get hurt but he we like, \"oh you're fine, nobody has gotten seriously hurt on these things except for one guy\" well I guess that makes him the second guy. He isn't married and doesn't have children, so it wasn't weird for me to come in and just say I was a friend. I plan on going in again tomorrow to see him. Nobody was there when I showed up and it hurts me knowing he is alone. His family has shown up but they live a few hours away so it's hard for them to come out. Today I just watched CNN with him and spoke some kind words to him. The nurse said I could change the channel but I know he like watching CNN, so I told her to keep it on so he could listen. The nurses said it is up to him on when he wants to wake up, if he wakes up. So again, send all the good, healing vibes to you can to this beautiful man. I love him so much and just want to see him smile again. I miss dancing with him in the kitchen while we bake cookies, cuddling on the couch watching movies, and going out and exploring the city with him. He can't leave me yet, he has so much more life to live. Once I get more updates, I'll be sure to inform you guys. Thank you for all the kind words, they truly have helped me and made me not feel so alone.",

But he still hadn't replied so I called but his phone went to voicemail. I thought maybe he blocked me but I noticed he wasn't active on Facebook in nearly a week and a half which is very unusual. So I stopped by his house but no one was there or answered even though his car was there. I had to reach out to his coworker whom I knew he worked with. She didn't tell me much but said she would keep me updated. I just stated we were friends. It was a long way to figure out what happened but I'm glad I know now. Even if it hurts. I love the man, I just hope he comes out okay",

So I stopped by his house but no one was there or answered even though his car was there. I had to reach out to his coworker whom I knew he worked with. She didn't tell me much but said she would keep me updated. I just stated we were friends. It was a long way to figure out what happened but I'm glad I know now. Even if it hurts. I love the man, I just hope he comes out okay",
