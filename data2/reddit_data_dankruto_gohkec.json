Even when people have other people kill them, whilst it was their decision to die, the killer is still charged with murder. \n\nSuicide is ONLY when you both choose to kill yourself and commit the act yourself. \n\nJumping in front of an innocent car? Suicide \n\nJumping in front a bullet or anything that had intent to harm? Murdered",
