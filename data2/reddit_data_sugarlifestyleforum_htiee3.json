    "body": "I know I\u2019m not in love but I think I love my SD. He\u2019s such a kind person and just always wants to make sure I\u2019m ok and taken care of. We\u2019ve been seeing each other for just over 2 months and even though we never worked out an arrangement I never had to. He gave me cash every week and had always offered to be there for me both emotionally and financially. \n\nI\u2019ve never felt like he just cares about sex. He just wants to see me and anytime I decide I don\u2019t want to sleep together we just cuddle and watch tv. He listens to me when I talk about my stressful family life or my friends and when I wanted to live alone (1 bedroom apartment) he just told me to find a place I like and he\u2019d cover it for me. I live in a big city so that\u2019s huge. First and last has been paid and he will continue to pay it every month. He\u2019s already discussed how we need to go furniture shopping. \n\nI\u2019ve met some of his friends at dinner and both them and my SD want me to be there at their weekly dinners. \n\nNow if I could just muster up enough courage to tell him I\u2019d be good. I make it clear that I\u2019m so so grateful and I know he really wants me to say it. I said it drunk once but I didn\u2019t want to acknowledge it and was okay with that but I know he\u2019s waiting to hear it. He has already said he loves me. \n\nHe\u2019s my SD, my BF and and the one person I\u2019m able to count on who makes me so happy. I love him \n\nNone of my friends know I sugar so I can\u2019t really talk about it but I just wanted to share. This is my first SR and only the 2nd guy I met off of SA and I never imagined it would\u2019ve gone like this. I\u2019m so excited to see what the future holds.",

            "body": "\"love each other, but not *in love* with each other\" is, for me, SR nirvana.  I suggest being careful how you tell him... it can be a delicate balance staying on the right side of the love/in-love line.  \"I love you\" sounds very in-loveish, and if he hears you say it and subconsciously gives himself permission to cross to the in-love side, it's impossible to get back again (maybe it's more like a cliff than a line \ud83e\udd23 ), and that can screw things up.  Don't get me wrong, telling him is good, not bad!  Just be careful how you frame it.",

He\u2019s very busy and tends to work 7 days a week. The weekend is lighter on him but still very busy. My bday was on a weekday and he still took it off to see me. It meant the world! I\u2019m 22",

Haha.  \n\nI know there are women in their 20s that are very mature, some people are \u201cold souls\u201d and people\u2019s behaviors & actions are largely shaped by their experiences.  \n\nBut I really shy away from women in their 20s.  I only want to be in  SRs where there is mutual satisfaction.  That requires chemistry combined with trust.  \n\nI\u2019ve found that at my age, there is a better chance of that happening with  women in their 30s-40s.",

Haha.  \n\nI know there are women in their 20s that are very mature, some people are \u201cold souls\u201d and people\u2019s behaviors & actions are largely shaped by their experiences.  \n\nBut I really shy away from women in their 20s.  I only want to be in  SRs where there is mutual satisfaction.  That requires chemistry combined with trust.  \n\nI\u2019ve found that at my age, there is a better chance of that happening with  women in their 30s-40s.",
