Correct me if I am wrong, but I think the word you are looking for is \"professional\". Like in an office environment or something. Its not so much about being more \"mature\" or being for \"children\". Looking \"mature\" has nothing to do with the type of fade you get. By getting a good haircut, and maintaining a solid grooming habit, you will look and come off as more mature, regardless of the fade.",

By getting a good haircut, and maintaining a solid grooming habit, you will look and come off as more mature, regardless of the fade.",

High fade means you're serving your country and your lifestyle is practical or you went to Great Clips and asked for a 4 on top and 1 on the sides. And they would ask you if your putting it on your moms tab because you guys get your hair cut by the same gal. ",
