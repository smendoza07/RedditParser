It's safe. It's simple and clean. Add a little texture with product as you'd like. It's just not very interesting.\n\nYou have plenty of options:\n\nhttp://www.mens-hairstyle.com/20-mens-hairstyles-for-fine-hair.html\n\nAnd hair grows... so ya know.. mix it up every once in a while. Try letting the top grow and keep the side short to give you an opportunity to actually style your hair.\n\n\n",
