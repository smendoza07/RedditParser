Likewise it would be problematic to cover where they are all are normally, why they have such incredible powers, summons that turn evil, and etc. \n\nUltimately we would be exposed to more narrative drawbacks with regular use so it was limited to support main arcs (sage training) and mid battle climaxes.\n\nImagine being a summon then getting zapped from your family dinner to fight against reanimated hokages and or a sannin?

Likewise it would be problematic to cover where they are all are normally, why they have such incredible powers, summons that turn evil, and etc. \n\nUltimately we would be exposed to more narrative drawbacks with regular use so it was limited to support main arcs (sage training) and mid battle climaxes.\n\nImagine being a summon then getting zapped from your family dinner to fight against reanimated hokages and or a sannin?
