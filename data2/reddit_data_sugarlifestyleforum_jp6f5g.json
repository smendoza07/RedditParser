    "body": "Bear with me; TLDR at the bottom...\nI was adopted when I was 5 days old. I don\u2019t remember NOT knowing that I was adopted, and my family never made a big deal about it. Some moms and dads can have a baby on their own, mine can\u2019t, so they got to pick me. No biggie. \n\nWhen I was still pretty young (somewhere around 6 or 7), I watched Mary Poppins for the first time. It\u2019s still my favorite movie. It became ABUNDANTLY clear very quickly to my 7 year old mind that Mary and Bert just *had* to be my biological parents. It made perfect sense. They were happy and funny and kind and loved singing and kids. So, duh. HA. \n\nAs I got older, obviously I realized that that\u2019s not how this works.... that\u2019s not how any of this works. To this day, I have an intense and undying affection for Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews, simply for bringing such joy into my life through Mary Poppins and their many other wonderful films. \n\nFast forward. I recently learned that DVD is on Cameo, which is an app in which people can request personalized videos from celebrities... no, not THAT type of video! I downloaded the app INSTANTLY and went to his page. He had received so many requests that he basically had to turn off the option for new requests. I was more upset about it than I\u2019d like to admit, and I got a little teary eyed when I told my SD about my disappointment. This was.... maybe a month-ish ago. \n\nFast forward again. Yesterday, I got a package in the mail from my SD (he lives in another state, and I won\u2019t see him for a couple of weeks). Y\u2019ALL. This man sent me an AUTOGRAPHED COPY of one of Dick Van Dyke\u2019s books. I was just beside myself. I started bawling in my car... partially because I was excited about the book, and partially because the gift itself was just so incredibly thoughtful. Just to think that he took my disappointment to heart, and then translated that into something he could give me that was extra special and bring me joy... I\u2019m getting misty-eyed as I\u2019m typing this. \n\nHe wasn\u2019t immediately available for me to call him when I got the package, but I texted him to let him know that I had received it. He replied, \u201cBecause you are special.\u201d Y\u2019all. This man. He makes me feel cared for in a way that I\u2019ve not experienced before. The best part is that he\u2019s truly become one of my best friends. I told him that he shot himself in the foot with this gift, because it\u2019s all he\u2019ll hear about until I finish the book. I hope he doesn\u2019t mind... and I cannot wait to truly THANK him and show my appreciation when I see him next. \n\nI\u2019m beaming today, and wanted to share the story of my thoughtful gift with some people who would truly understand. Happy Fri-yay, y\u2019all! \ud83d\udc95\n\nTL;DR- SD surprised me with a very thoughtful gift with lots of personal meaning behind it. I can\u2019t wait to show him how much I love it.",
