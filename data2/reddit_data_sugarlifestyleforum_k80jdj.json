    "body": "My first post can be read [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/k6sv1c/long_term_sd_ghosted_me_without_any_warning/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\nEdit: I removed the original post. I felt bad after finding out what happened. \n\nI cannot believe I am making this post. I don\u2019t have a lot to say, right now, as I am sorting out my own emotions and am quite numb, at the moment. \n\nMy SD died. There isn\u2019t any poetic way to sugarcoat it, nor is there much else for me to report, because I got the most minimal version of the events possible. His great niece contacted me after seeing the missed calls and texts from me in his phone. She knew about his sugar involvement and was very kind to me. She also told me I would have been more than welcome at the services, but they have already come and gone. She said she will be in touch to let me know if he left anything for me, because apparently she feels it\u2019s something he might have done, but that isn\u2019t something I\u2019m expecting nor am I sure I\u2019d even feel comfortable with. He was not married, and has one adult child. Everything he told me about his life was true. \n\nI am feeling a great deal of sorrow for his family, friends and coworkers. He was truly an understanding, kind, compassionate, empathetic and incredible person. He will be mourned and sorely missed. \n\nThank you all for your support on my last post and for any given here. I appreciate your kind words and the guessing games you were playing with me. I feel terrible for even momentarily thinking he was bad, a liar or anything other than what he\u2019d presented himself to be with me. I am going to do my best to honor my sadness and move on.",

A male friend (retired USAF col)   would come to get me late morning.  My SB lived across LA and her (she and partner) entrepreneurial startup needed her for another 18 hour day and she would start 3 hours late. \n\nI came back to consciousness to a very bright light and very intrusive questioning   what's my name, what's 5 x 7 ......  my groggy brain knew they would not be asking these questions unless my heart had stopped.  It was just as the plastic surgeon  was packing up his gear and taking photos of his handiwork. \n\nAfter an hour or so they shipped me off  observation and monitoring. My cardiologist stopped by and I got some much needed sleep....  \n\nWhen I woke my SB and friend were sitting by my bed quietly talking. Unknown to me she had parked after she dropped me off, snuck in and had the desk add her name and number as a contact. My friend had never met her but was the one person who knew of the relationship. \n\nOur 5 year sugar relationship ended when she started a serious IRL relationship.  My most treasured Christmas gift last year was a card with a long note from her expressing her continued thanks for the wonderful relationship and how it benefited her.",

It isn\u2019t like I\u2019m alone, but it still feels like a piece of me is gone. It\u2019s almost like I\u2019m grieving someone that wasn\u2019t really mine, which makes the grief a little confusing and harder to get under control. I also feel everything really deeply, am seriously empathic and just overall emotionally in touch as a person, which is useful a lot of the time but makes this kind of thing more painful in general. I also know my SD had another SB and I know nothing about how to reach her or whether or not she knows. She was more of a now and then fling that he had, but sounded like a sweet girl. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s wondering if he\u2019s okay as well. Maybe she\u2019ll see this post and recognize familiarities and message me. Ugh.",

Based on what you had written,  and the fact that you were in touch (mid conversation) with presumably no major SR issues and had been together for awhile, it seemed highly unlikely he would flat out ghost.  Ghosting is a thing in this world but very rarely under the above circumstances.\n\nYou mentioned that you felt bad for his family, friends,  etc. but YOU were an important part of his life as well.  You lost someone suddenly that mattered to you and that's difficult.  Not a SR thing, but I lost a close friend (45yo, fit as a 20 something) to a sudden cardiac arrest in July. All deaths are very difficult but sudden, unexpected deaths are even more so in my opinion.   Allow yourself to mourn this loss.  If you can, visit his gravesite if there is one and talk to him.  Whatever helps you move on.  Just take comfort in the fact that you brightened his life while you were in it.",

And sudden deaths are extremely difficult for the loved ones left (though I'd prefer to go this way when my time is up but I'd be the one going, not left lol). I sense you are very self aware and will be just fine.  There is no shortcut to morning a loss, we all do it a bit differently.

It was just as the plastic surgeon  was packing up his gear and taking photos of his handiwork. \n\nAfter an hour or so they shipped me off  observation and monitoring. My cardiologist stopped by and I got some much needed sleep....  \n\nWhen I woke my SB and friend were sitting by my bed quietly talking. Unknown to me she had parked after she dropped me off, snuck in and had the desk add her name and number as a contact. My friend had never met her but was the one person who knew of the relationship. \n\nOur 5 year sugar relationship ended when she started a serious IRL relationship.  My most treasured Christmas gift last year was a card with a long note from her expressing her continued thanks for the wonderful relationship and how it benefited her.",

I also feel everything really deeply, am seriously empathic and just overall emotionally in touch as a person, which is useful a lot of the time but makes this kind of thing more painful in general. I also know my SD had another SB and I know nothing about how to reach her or whether or not she knows. She was more of a now and then fling that he had, but sounded like a sweet girl.

A male friend (retired USAF col)   would come to get me late morning.  My SB lived across LA and her (she and partner) entrepreneurial startup needed her for another 18 hour day and she would start 3 hours late. \n\nI came back to consciousness to a very bright light and very intrusive questioning   what's my name, what's 5 x 7 ......  my groggy brain knew they would not be asking these questions unless my heart had stopped.  It was just as the plastic surgeon  was packing up his gear and taking photos of his handiwork. \n\nAfter an hour or so they shipped me off  observation and monitoring. My cardiologist stopped by and I got some much needed sleep....  \n\nWhen I woke my SB and friend were sitting by my bed quietly talking. Unknown to me she had parked after she dropped me off, snuck in and had the desk add her name and number as a contact. My friend had never met her but was the one person who knew of the relationship. \n\nOur 5 year sugar relationship ended when she started a serious IRL relationship.  My most treasured Christmas gift last year was a card with a long note from her expressing her continued thanks for the wonderful relationship and how it benefited her.",

And sudden deaths are extremely difficult for the loved ones left (though I'd prefer to go this way when my time is up but I'd be the one going, not left lol). I sense you are very self aware and will be just fine.  There is no shortcut to morning a loss, we all do it a bit differently.  Just allow yourself time to process this so you can move on with great memories.",
