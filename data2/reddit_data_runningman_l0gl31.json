Somin's connections are not that influential. Even among her co-stars, she is probably the most popular (maybe Kim Ji Seok and Ha Seokjin but I don't think they are above her status). Whereas Kwangsoo acts with A list actors and features in solid directors' films. Also, age and image affect female actors a lot more than males. She is an actress but is known more for her RM role. \n\nI can understand if that worries her.",

She is an actress but is known more for her RM role. \n\nI can understand if that worries her.",
