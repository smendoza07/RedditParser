When I first wrote this, I'd just read a fanfic which showed exactly what Naru would do so I just narrated it... the fic was really messed up but back then I didn't think my post would hurt anyone. I realize that in some way I degraded rape victims and I'm really sorry if I brought up unecessary negative emotions. I really should have known better but now I'm good. I don't wanna delete the comment cause then it makes it seem like I didn't do anything wrong so it'll always be my reminder to do better for those around me. Just know I really am sorry and that I'm usually not that callous of a pig, I don't know what posessed me... I can undertsnd if u're mad or think I'm a monster and I hope the next time we meet u'll see a noticeable difference\\^\\^",

I realize that in some way I degraded rape victims and I'm really sorry if I brought up unecessary negative emotions. I really should have known better but now I'm good. I don't wanna delete the comment cause then it makes it seem like I didn't do anything wrong so it'll always be my reminder to do better for those around me. Just know I really am sorry and that I'm usually not that callous of a pig, I don't know what posessed me... I can undertsnd if u're mad or think I'm a monster and I hope the next time we meet u'll see a noticeable difference\\^\\^",

You say \"using them for their bodies\" like there was any sexual intent behind it and not like he was using these bodies to transfer himself into to become immortal\n\nAnd then redirecting to imply the person you're responding to is a pedophile just because they don't believe two characters who have NEVER shown sexual interest to the underage boys themselves is just pathetic. And no it doesn't count when Naruto transforms because he is literally transforming into a naked adult woman",

I realize that in some way I degraded rape victims and I'm really sorry if I brought up unecessary negative emotions. I really should have known better but now I'm good. I don't wanna delete the comment cause then it makes it seem like I didn't do anything wrong so it'll always be my reminder to do better for those around me.

I realize that in some way I degraded rape victims and I'm really sorry if I brought up unecessary negative emotions. I really should have known better but now I'm good. I don't wanna delete the comment cause then it makes it seem like I didn't do anything wrong so it'll always be my reminder to do better for those around me. Just know I really am sorry and that I'm usually not that callous of a pig, I don't know what posessed me...

I realize that in some way I degraded rape victims and I'm really sorry if I brought up unecessary negative emotions. I really should have known better but now I'm good. I don't wanna delete the comment cause then it makes it seem like I didn't do anything wrong so it'll always be my reminder to do better for those around me. Just know I really am sorry and that I'm usually not that callous of a pig, I don't know what posessed me... I can undertsnd if u're mad or think I'm a monster and I hope the next time we meet u'll see a noticeable difference\\^\\^",
