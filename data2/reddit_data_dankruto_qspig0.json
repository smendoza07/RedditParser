Show me who you are!\"\n\nHe beat his ass as expected but I'm kinda glad he straight up BRUTALIZED him I would say even though Narut's himselfs fights are usually fueled by RAGE he never DOGS his opponents so hard lmao. He wanted to show Kono the PAIN that awaits him on his path, just like always.\n\nHe'd have insta killed him with Sage mode but the fact that he went there without needing even after spanking the shit out of him made me laugh.

Show me who you are!\"\n\nHe beat his ass as expected but I'm kinda glad he straight up BRUTALIZED him I would say even though Narut's himselfs fights are usually fueled by RAGE he never DOGS his opponents so hard lmao.

But it's not at all similar. Or do you believe we should accuse a murderers parents/guardian for committed murders, and not the murderer themselves? Obito caused everything up until the seal was revoked. After that, though Obito was the initial cause, he was not the one to blame for Minato dying.",

An argument could be made for either, but I agree that Obito killed Kushina, but used Kurama to do it. Minato needing to seal Kurama is what killed him, yes. So how was my argument \"patently false\" when Kurama was the cause of death for both??",

But it's not at all similar. Or do you believe we should accuse a murderers parents/guardian for committed murders, and not the murderer themselves? Obito caused everything up until the seal was revoked. After that, though Obito was the initial cause, he was not the one to blame for Minato dying.",

You compared Kurama to a tool used for a purpose (which is inaccurate since he\u2019s a sentient being who later says he acted out of hatred), so my response was that you can accept that a tool was used for wrong instead of good and still not embrace that tool (I.e. that Batman can accept guns as both good and bad and still choose to stay away from them)",
