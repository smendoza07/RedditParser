    "body": "Can any other SBs relate to this annoying struggle? I\u2019ve seen it on some other forums but not on this one. None of my friends are in the sugar world but a few know about my arrangement. I got lucky with a VERY generous SD who loves giving gifts and always is asking me what would make me happy. My friends know this (because they ask). I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve gotten variations of \u201cask him for ___ and give it to me\u201d or \u201cGet me something while you\u2019re there\u201d. It makes me so prickly! This bothers me for two reasons\n\n1. I\u2019M WORKING! If I get spoiled it\u2019s because I\u2019m earning it!! It\u2019s not a traditional job I understand but I just cannot impress upon them enough, how much time and effort goes into cultivating a real relationship like this. It is not some old pathetic guy who is throwing things at me to buy my love. This is a successful man who yes will buy you things/pay for your company but in return for equal effort.  You literally are forming yourself to be the perfect companion, always \u201con\u201d 24/7 if you\u2019re together, be entertaining, attentive, pleasant etc CONSISTENTLY regardless of whatever is happening in your life/your feelings. Girl this purse is a work bonus \n\n2. I have an actual relationship/friendship with my SD. Why would I take advantage of him?? I don\u2019t ask for things I don\u2019t need and if he tells me he wants to buy me X and I genuinely will not get use from it I\u2019ll say that! I don\u2019t ask for things for myself why would I do that for you? \n\nI also try to put similar effort in all my friendships and try to be generous/thoughtful myself. I give gifts, send flowers for any small life achievement and it\u2019s not like I flaunt any of the nice things I\u2019m given. It just gives off this air of entitlement that rubs me the wrong way. \n\nfin",

On top of that if your SD requires discretion, you will have possibly jeopardized that aspect if you see him in public. You're in the bowl, so if you bump into someone you know, they will know he is too.\n\nRemember there is a lot of competition amongst young women in society, so if any start feeling insecure about where their life is heading (financially, dating a successful guy etc), they may turn the focus on you.\n\nI met one SB whose ex-friend did the dog act of sending screenshots of her SA profile to her parents and SO.\n\nYour cover story should be: you like older guys, they often have their shit together and are happy to go out to nice places (unlike younger guys). You met on tinder/bumble etc.\n\n\"\\[I\\] give gifts, send flowers for any small life achievement\"\n\nI really like how caring and sharing you are, but this can accidentally cause resentment.

Like everyone else said, limit how much you mention the gifts your SD gives. You could say it's a fake Chanel or you thrifted it online. Yes, some people have a sense of entitlement. They see what you have and want it, but ignore the work you did to get there. Speaking from experience, this is true of SB friends, too.\n\nBUT (and it's a big BUTT) your SD is worth bragging about and I don't blame you for wanting to share your happiness. Unfortunately, sometimes seeing your good fortune brings out the ugliness in other people. Keep being yourself. You're such a thoughtful and genuine person, gauging from this post alone. Only best wishes from me! \u2764\ufe0f",

On top of that if your SD requires discretion, you will have possibly jeopardized that aspect if you see him in public. You're in the bowl, so if you bump into someone you know, they will know he is too.\n\nRemember there is a lot of competition amongst young women in society, so if any start feeling insecure about where their life is heading (financially, dating a successful guy etc), they may turn the focus on you.\n\nI met one SB whose ex-friend did the dog act of sending screenshots of her SA profile to her parents and SO.\n\nYour cover story should be: you like older guys, they often have their shit together and are happy to go out to nice places (unlike younger guys). You met on tinder/bumble etc.\n\n\"\\[I\\] give gifts, send flowers for any small life achievement\"\n\nI really like how caring and sharing you are, but this can accidentally cause resentment.

I think it's important to have a place to talk about your experiences (while being mindful not to brag) without them getting weird.
