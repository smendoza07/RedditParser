    "body": "**Introduction (stop using 2 in 1 or 3 in 1 shit)**\n\nI've been putting off writing this because of the stigma that \"knowing\" or caring about your hair is \"gay\", I had to deal with this stigma as I tried to grow out my hair when I was 14. I don't think this is right and any male should be able to care about his hair without being having to worry about stigma. Everyone wants to have good hair; hair is a source of confidence for many men.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not a professional, I'm just a normal guy who's done a lot of research because I was sick of having bad hair days.\n\nNatural hair and promoting your natural genetic tendencies is what I'm aiming to promote with this guide. [See this picture of me aged 14 vs aged 21.](https://i.imgur.com/RI4ejCj.jpg)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Basics (boring information stuff)**\n\nEven though hair cells are dead, your hair should be treated like a living organism. Certain things can be more damaging then beneficial; this means damaged hair will take time to repair.\n\nThe purpose of shampoo is to remove oil and dirt that is in your hair. Conditioner's purpose is to put back some oils to make it soft and managable for combing and styling. However, naturally your scalp produces oils that naturally condition your hair. These oils also become striped when you use certain shampoos ^(psst it's sulphates). Certain shampoos can be more damaging than others (as I will explain later).\n\nIf you shampoo too often your scalp will produce more oils in an attempt to restore equilibrium (balance). This means if you shampoo daily and stop suddenly, you will experience a rebound effect where your scalp is producing too much oil. The result can be oily hair, dandruff or an itchy scalp. In this case, it may be worth while to slowly reduce the amount of shampoo you use over a longer period of time. It's kinda like a drug in which you will experience withdrawals, you can go cold turkey and deal with an itchy scalp and dandruff for awhile or you can reduce your usage over time.\n\nConditioning hair seals in moisture and is normally used if your hair is too dry. This is why most brands recommend you use their conditioning product if you use their shampoo product.\n\n1. You can use a shampoo and conditioner\n2. You can use shampoo and not use conditioner (use as needed e.g. when you feel your hair is too dirty or too much build up)\n3. You can use conditioner and not use shampoo (called co-washing)\n4. You can use no shampoo at all (no shampoo relies on your scalp to reach that eventual balance, however this doesn't work for everyone)\n\nI use a combination, I shampoo when needed and I condition when needed. This is entirely up to you and **overall it can be all boiled down to**:\n\n* Use shampoo if your hair is too oily (build up)\n* Use conditioner if your hair is too dry\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Temperature**\n\nThe temperature of the water while you shower can dry out your skin, including your scalp. This can worsen dandruff and dry out your hair (loss of those oils my dude). Thus cold showers are actually better for your hair and skin, but who's going to do that? If you still want a warm shower, just adjust the temperature until it's as cold as you can manage. Just avoid hot and steamy (although relaxing) showers. If you do turn up that heat, just don't get your hair wet, I'm fucking serious.\n\nScientific reasoning is:\n\n1. hot = more energy\n2. more energy evaporates more stuff\n3. therefore dryness and itchy hell\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Shampoo and Conditioner Products (it's all a scam)**\n\nOkay so most shampoo and conditioner products are a scam. They use the same chemicals.  L\u2019Oreal, Aveeno, Garnier, Herbal Essences, Pantene, Dove, Head and Shoulders...ect. all use the same shit. Most shampoos use  **Sodium Lauryl Sulfate/Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Sulfates)** while most conditioners use **silicones (ingredients ending with \u201c-cone\u201d)**.\n\n* Sulphates are bad because they strip natural oils, causing your scalp to become itchy and dry.\n* Silicones are bad because most silicone chemicals are not water soluable. This means that they build up in your hair.\n\nSulphate products are designed so that they can remove silicones from your hair. They are strong chemicals in that regard, thus this is why they are effective at treating dandruff. However it is in your best interest to not be held back by these hair drugs and you should only use every so often, with the goal of no usage *evennnntually.*\n\n* If you are making the switch from Sulphates/Silicones, you should do a reset wash by using a ***sulphate product that has no silicones***.\n\nYou will need to go to a pharmacy or a supermarket and look at products' ingredients list. Yes, this is where the effort comes in. Generally natural products will advertise that they are sulphate or silicone free. This will vary from location, country and region. It really just depends what you can find or order online. I will refer you to this [ultimate guide from /r/curlyhair](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q6Dj9WAZxlfBhJSyS5on2rw3-if5cOV3oV-dQ3B0AHA/edit#heading=h.exb4a3d58zp), it has some suggestions but I just used the the first natural product I could find.\n\nGood products will cost more money, although if you use less (as I'm suggesting) you will only need to buy hair care products every 3-6 months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Hair Styling Products**\n\nThis is getting fucking long so you get dot points now.\n\n* Your natural oils act as product, style while your hair is wet and let it naturally dry.\n* Look for water soluable products\n* If you use a hair dryer; a hair diffuser is an option to reduce further frizz (it's like naturally drying it but quicker)\n* Becareful of non-water soluable products as they might not be easily removed from your hair (only sulphate products may be able to remove them)\n* Touch your hair less as this produces more oils\n* Consider that different hair products are tailored to different hair types (curly, dry, damaged, voluming... ect)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know if this is general knowledge, so if it is... My bad lol. I didn't know most of this until recently. If there is anything to add comment it below. This guide will help any hair and promote a natural healthy style but it's more important the longer your hair is.\n\n**EDIT:** Another tip is not to go crazy on your hair with a towel when it's wet, but rather to pat dry it, as this can damage it.",

I spent two years growing out my hair because I was always told that I had beautiful hair. I spent another two years putting it in a bun because I couldnt consistently style it effectively. Now that I've gone to this method (along with using mousse and hair gel) I wear my hair down and proudly wayyy more often.",

This was due to me using shampoo every single day.\n\nAll I do now is use a scalp brush to get rid of any sort of build up, then I co-wash it, I use the brush again to spread the conditioner, and my hair is finally looking better. I blot my hair with a tshirt to get the excess water out and occasionally use the Umberto Giannini No More Frizz to help settle it down. This also helps the curls stay after I curl them with my fingers. After that, I just let it air dry. And if not, I use a hair dryer from far away, so the curls don\u2019t get disrupted.",

I work out every morning and shower right after, but I also do jiu-jitsu a couple times a week which involves a lot of rolling around, getting squished and lots of sweat. I kinda just shampoo twice a week, but idk the how to tell if my hair is getting gross from buildup in-between.\n\nShould I brush, and if so how often? My hair is kinda wavy to slightly curly, fine and pretty thick. Right now I'm just kinda pushing it back. I've been told by a couple people that I should try to go for the Jon Snow look.\n\nWhat's the best way to restyle it after it's been messed up? I said before, it's kinda thick. It'll tend to stay in whatever weird way it dried. Most of the time, it stays good, but sometimes I'll have some clump of it stick up on top of my head and I can't get it back down easily. Would a sea-salt spray be good for that, I hear people mention those a lot.\n\nI don't really systematically take pictures of my hair, sometimes just take a selfie if I have a day I feel like I'm looking good. [But here's an album of such shots over the past two months.](http://imgur.com/gallery/kxK8CmH) I know they're not really close ups of my hair so it might not be that useful lol, but figured I'd include them.\n\nI've been using American Crew shampoo and conditioner, the conditioner daily and the shampoo twice a week. I checked and the shampoo does have sulfates so I'll have to look for another one. I'm not sure anything listed in the conditioner was a silicone, but I might look for something else anyways.",

It's up to you, but harsher brushes can irritate your scalp if you brush your scalp too much. This is causes it to produce more oil. Honestly, it's just preference.\n\nThe Conditioner doesn't have silicones, so I'd take time to find a new shampoo that doesn't have sulfates or silicones. You should see any improvement.  Sodium Lauryl Sulfate or Sodium Laureth Sulfate are my enemy!!! The shit makes me reek of BO if I use a brand of soap of this stuff for my armpits, it's honestly toxic. Once you find one, use the gentler shampoo more regularly and treat the sulfate stuff as stronger stuff.\n\nI say to keep the sulfate shampoo because you may want to experiment with both shampoos, this will get you an idea on what you want to do next.",

It's up to you, but harsher brushes can irritate your scalp if you brush your scalp too much. This is causes it to produce more oil. Honestly, it's just preference.\n\nThe Conditioner doesn't have silicones, so I'd take time to find a new shampoo that doesn't have sulfates or silicones. You should see any improvement.  Sodium Lauryl Sulfate or Sodium Laureth Sulfate are my enemy!!! The shit makes me reek of BO if I use a brand of soap of this stuff for my armpits, it's honestly toxic. Once you find one, use the gentler shampoo more regularly and treat the sulfate stuff as stronger stuff.\n\nI say to keep the sulfate shampoo because you may want to experiment with both shampoos, this will get you an idea on what you want to do next.",
