    "body": "We both knew this would be coming. We were together for six years and I gave her 100+% of the financial support she needed to quit her job, go back to school, and get into med school. \n\nWe were sexually exclusive for four and a half years of the relationship. \n\nShe\u2019s almost 30 now and wants to get married and have kids, so pretty much since she got into medical school I told her she should look for a husband. But looking while having an SD turned out suboptimal; it\u2019s hard to give a relationship a real go when you\u2019re seeing your SD. So she decided things needed to end with me so she has a decent chance of making something work longer term.\n\nAs much as I always wanted for her to get into med school and move on, this is quite emotionally difficult. Honestly, it was hard not to keep getting teary eyed at work today.\n\nIt\u2019s not that I can\u2019t find someone else; it\u2019s just impossible to replace six years of a caring and trusting relationship with someone I genuinely loved.",

Long story short, four months after our breakup, I asked her to dinner for Valentine\u2019s Day. She said if some guy doesn\u2019t pull through she\u2019d come. We met and she asked me why I didn\u2019t take my SB at the time to dinner on VD. I told her, \u201cHonestly, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to even pretend to want her to be my valentine. With you at least I know you love me and you know I love you and that we deeply care about each other.\u201d Over the next few weeks, we kinda fought over texts some but ended up meeting once and it was just so relaxed and nice. Just a relief from crappy old IRL and sugar dating. So we ended up back together for a year. Of course, she eventually found someone else and broke it off again for now but wants to keep in close touch. Probably this is the end but maybe not. Only time will tell.\n\nIn the meanwhile, I deactivated my SA account and within a week met someone lovely and deactivated it. Let\u2019s see how it goes\u2026.",

The care and empathy that is necessary to build a real connection while also being strong enough to let go of possessiveness is not something that comes easy or naturally but it is a beautiful thing all the same.\n\nEmbrace the pain my friend.  The valleys of sorrow simply represent the real impact the love you and her shared.  The scars simply show you had the courage to live in a way that made you fulfilled and happy.  Good luck recovering and hopefully exploring your next chapter in this grand story of life.\n\n*edit* Just realize this thread is a year old smh.

We met and she asked me why I didn\u2019t take my SB at the time to dinner on VD. I told her, \u201cHonestly, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to even pretend to want her to be my valentine. With you at least I know you love me and you know I love you and that we deeply care about each other.\u201d Over the next few weeks, we kinda fought over texts some but ended up meeting once and it was just so relaxed and nice. Just a relief from crappy old IRL and sugar dating. So we ended up back together for a year. Of course, she eventually found someone else and broke it off again for now but wants to keep in close touch. Probably this is the end but maybe not. Only time will tell.\n\nIn the meanwhile, I deactivated my SA account and within a week met someone lovely and deactivated it. Let\u2019s see how it goes\u2026.",
