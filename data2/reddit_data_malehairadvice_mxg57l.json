Be specific. Express your personal interests because the generic \"I like movies, music and hanging out with your friends\" says nothing about you. Where as if you say \"I'm into rock climbing. I like baroque music and I like to metal sculpt\" says so much more will attract fewer women but the women you do attract will be a much better match. My current partner was attracted by a geeky Doctor Who quote I put on profile and we've been together for a long time now. \n\nSame goes with your hair. I mean if hair isn't your thing.

Be specific. Express your personal interests because the generic \"I like movies, music and hanging out with your friends\" says nothing about you. Where as if you say \"I'm into rock climbing. I like baroque music and I like to metal sculpt\" says so much more will attract fewer women but the women you do attract will be a much better match. My current partner was attracted by a geeky Doctor Who quote I put on profile and we've been together for a long time now. \n\nSame goes with your hair. I mean if hair isn't your thing. Then you can find something practical that's commonly stylish and easy to manage and focus on other things.",

Someone compatible to you, will be attracted by your personal style rather than trying to cast a broad net and catch girls that aren't into the things you're into.\n\nI learned this when using dating sites. Be specific. Express your personal interests because the generic \"I like movies, music and hanging out with your friends\" says nothing about you. Where as if you say \"I'm into rock climbing. I like baroque music and I like to metal sculpt\" says so much more will attract fewer women but the women you do attract will be a much better match. My current partner was attracted by a geeky Doctor Who quote I put on profile and we've been together for a long time now. \n\nSame goes with your hair. I mean if hair isn't your thing. Then you can find something practical that's commonly stylish and easy to manage and focus on other things.",

Someone compatible to you, will be attracted by your personal style rather than trying to cast a broad net and catch girls that aren't into the things you're into.\n\nI learned this when using dating sites. Be specific. Express your personal interests because the generic \"I like movies, music and hanging out with your friends\" says nothing about you. Where as if you say \"I'm into rock climbing. I like baroque music and I like to metal sculpt\" says so much more will attract fewer women but the women you do attract will be a much better match. My current partner was attracted by a geeky Doctor Who quote I put on profile and we've been together for a long time now. \n\nSame goes with your hair. I mean if hair isn't your thing.

Someone compatible to you, will be attracted by your personal style rather than trying to cast a broad net and catch girls that aren't into the things you're into.\n\nI learned this when using dating sites. Be specific. Express your personal interests because the generic \"I like movies, music and hanging out with your friends\" says nothing about you. Where as if you say \"I'm into rock climbing. I like baroque music and I like to metal sculpt\" says so much more will attract fewer women but the women you do attract will be a much better match. My current partner was attracted by a geeky Doctor Who quote I put on profile and we've been together for a long time now. \n\nSame goes with your hair. I mean if hair isn't your thing. Then you can find something practical that's commonly stylish and easy to manage and focus on other things.",

Your comment is hyperbole. They call this a \"pathos argument\" because it's about appealing to emotion. You're trying to shame me and make me feel rejected.\n\nThe thing is. You're an internet stranger. You have zero impact on my ego. I'm here because I'm making a point and to the right people, it will have some resonance. Clearly you're not the right person.",

Someone compatible to you, will be attracted by your personal style rather than trying to cast a broad net and catch girls that aren't into the things you're into.\n\nI learned this when using dating sites. Be specific. Express your personal interests because the generic \"I like movies, music and hanging out with your friends\" says nothing about you. Where as if you say \"I'm into rock climbing. I like baroque music and I like to metal sculpt\" says so much more will attract fewer women but the women you do attract will be a much better match. My current partner was attracted by a geeky Doctor Who quote I put on profile and we've been together for a long time now. \n\nSame goes with your hair. I mean if hair isn't your thing. Then you can find something practical that's commonly stylish and easy to manage and focus on other things.",
