    "body": "Well folks, looks like we have another story about SB turned SW. i used to be active on this sub, and shared some stories. So I figured I would bring it full circle and leave an update. We married recently and I couldn\u2019t be happier. \n\nYes, SBs, I am still spoiled ROTTEN- regularly receiving cash gifts plus luxury goods (bags, jewelry, etc). \n\nYes, SDs, I still spoil my man ROTTEN- fun (& sexy) surprises, emotional support, consistency. It\u2019s awesome. It\u2019s truly awesome. \n\nTo everyone out there going through the drama of the sugar bowl\u2026 if you have questions (actually, anyone), feel free to ask. That place is awful sometimes, keep your head on straight and communicate with this sub. It\u2019s wonderful here. \n\nFor anyone curious\u2026 met my SD on hinge, pursued a casual/natural arrangement (no $$ discussed in the beginning, or ever) that evolved over about a year of sugar dating, then a year of exclusive dating (vanilla but sugar never stopped), then married. \n\nI don\u2019t have to work, but I have a business and sometimes work full or part time depending on my mood. We have *amazing* sex. Emotionally fulfilling in every way. He\u2019s hot. We travel. Just bought a big home in the burbs. Two days ago we were drinking wine in a bubble bath in a glass villa in the jungle of Costa Rica, Micro dosing LSD, waiting for the masseuses to arrive for our couples massage. Finished the massage, smoked a blunt, then I blind folded him and tied him to the bed while we played the \u201cdon\u2019t move no matter what\u201d game. Seriously!? I am living the dream \ud83d\ude2d\n\nFor aspiring or struggling SBs\u2026 I got lucky, but we never discussed sugar in the beginning. I never tried to say I want \u201cx\u201d for \u201cy\u201d. He is a good man who knew how to spoil me from day 1\u2026 even if I wanted to come up with some numbers or negotiations, it would have just turned him off and we wouldn\u2019t have made it to where we are today. \n\nTo be frank, I\u2019m so in love, even if there were no sugar I\u2019d be by his side. Always look at his heart first! You might just find the real sugar, a pot of gold within! \ud83e\udef6",

It\u2019s almost a way of doubting yourself - I don\u2019t know if I can be faithful in future or not so I am making a vow now to remind my weak self. \n\nLike making a promise publicly but weather you deliver or not, only time can tell.. \n\nA guy told me his wife has zero interests in sex but she won\u2019t allow him to get sex elsewhere. That\u2019s narcissistic. In the situation you said husband fuck around but won\u2019t let wife do, that\u2019s narcissistic too. It\u2019s all about control. \n\nAlthough it\u2019s toxic and unfair in my view, I know many people choose to be abused. The guy I know still stuck in his sexless marriage and the next 30 years it\u2019s only him and his hands .. he has a choice but he chose to stay with a narcissist. It\u2019s entirely the individuals choice. \n\nFinancial success is an important quality in a man to me when I select a mate but I don\u2019t care about his money. If one day he loses everything because of bad luck, I give him the financial help he needs to re-make it again. But if one day he becomes a drunk and loses his ambition, sorry I have to leave you for someone else. I love you for being you with all the qualities (the bad the good & the ugly) you have now, I didn\u2019t sign up to love a drunk loser. I hold the same expectation to myself. If he loves me for my compassion and kindness, he shouldn\u2019t love me if I become bitter and nasty one day. \n\nActually point 2&3 of yours illustrate a perfect sugar wife - taking his money for being in a one sided relationship. Anyway, money comes first before the husband. I guess it\u2019s none of my business so I don\u2019t really care why people marry.",

Saying if she lets her husband to have a SB but she\u2019s not allowed to have a lover, that\u2019s one sided - as you said that can be paid because she married a rich dude. \n\nI never check other peoples post history. I take their words at face value. I don\u2019t particularly try to find faults in people. \n\nWell, money comes first before husband is what gold diggers do right? \n\nI personally choose the guy first. And like I said , financial ability is a quality I\u2019d like my boyfriend to have. I say that because I am good financially and I expect him to be better. But if a wealthy man with bad characters, he won\u2019t pass my test or become my boyfriend either. So in my case, the man comes first before money. \n\nMany wage earners got married with kids and just look at how the population grow in big cities. Sorry not quite sure what you are trying to prove in your last paragraph. \n\nBy the way, some guys on seek look for wives actually. I don\u2019t think they care if their wives were sugar babies. Men and women are both on that app, why is it necessary that men are better than women by doing exactly the same thing? If many guys don\u2019t want to marry SBs , many SBs will judge SDs the same way. \n\nI definitely don\u2019t judge men on Seek. I met some decent gentlemen on Seek, fewer creeps than on bumble to be honest. Nothing wrong of being SDs or SBs. \n\nI only judge you if you cheat, manipulate or use other people as means to an end. Luckily not all people on seek cheat, manipulate or use people.",

It\u2019s me looking for a lifelong partner not you so I define his greatness, not you. Just like I can\u2019t judge for you how good your girlfriend/wife is .. therefore, the great guy you said could not be so great to me. \n\nBut those not so great guys in my book have no problem of finding wives and have kids. Many girls would be proud that their husbands are lawyers, doctors earning 100k per year with a mortgage free house. So it doesn\u2019t matter if I don\u2019t find them great enough to date. I probably would consider dating a lawyer when I was 28, but I am 40 and my wealth doubled, a lawyer won\u2019t be earning enough to enjoy the lifestyle I want to have .. \n\nI am not on this Reddit all the time. But personally I met two guys on seek looking for marriage .. but just turned out they aren\u2019t great enough for me. So if they look for future wives on seek, they are definitely aware all the girls are potentially sugar babies. \n\nI don\u2019t feel being judged by any men I met on seek. I often filter out guys who are married (cheat) or open relationship so I don\u2019t see those profiles I have no clue if they judge. Honestly I\u2019d laugh If a cheat judges girls on seek. Lol \n\nThe rest that I end up meeting are all quite decent and non judgemental.. Well if you judge and think it\u2019s bad to marry a SB, you do you. You never really know your girlfriends history to be honest. You might think she\u2019s an angle (met her in the library , not on seek and she\u2019s in a white dress etc) but turned out she might have been a professional sex worker at night in the past year. \n\nAnd nowadays the hookup culture is so popular. I think most young chicks had a few dozen of dudes while they were pissed in a club. What difference it makes to sugaring? At least most sugar babies fuck their daddies soberly so they don\u2019t forget how to count their money .. \n\nIt\u2019s better you don\u2019t go search people\u2019s past and judge them harshly. It only matters what she\u2019s doing and how she makes you feel right now. But again you do you. Whatever makes you happy mate as we are all different.",

It\u2019s almost a way of doubting yourself - I don\u2019t know if I can be faithful in future or not so I am making a vow now to remind my weak self. \n\nLike making a promise publicly but weather you deliver or not, only time can tell.. \n\nA guy told me his wife has zero interests in sex but she won\u2019t allow him to get sex elsewhere. That\u2019s narcissistic. In the situation you said husband fuck around but won\u2019t let wife do, that\u2019s narcissistic too. It\u2019s all about control. \n\nAlthough it\u2019s toxic and unfair in my view, I know many people choose to be abused. The guy I know still stuck in his sexless marriage and the next 30 years it\u2019s only him and his hands .. he has a choice but he chose to stay with a narcissist. It\u2019s entirely the individuals choice. \n\nFinancial success is an important quality in a man to me when I select a mate but I don\u2019t care about his money. If one day he loses everything because of bad luck, I give him the financial help he needs to re-make it again. But if one day he becomes a drunk and loses his ambition, sorry I have to leave you for someone else. I love you for being you with all the qualities (the bad the good & the ugly) you have now, I didn\u2019t sign up to love a drunk loser. I hold the same expectation to myself. If he loves me for my compassion and kindness, he shouldn\u2019t love me if I become bitter and nasty one day. \n\nActually point 2&3 of yours illustrate a perfect sugar wife - taking his money for being in a one sided relationship. Anyway, money comes first before the husband. I guess it\u2019s none of my business so I don\u2019t really care why people marry.",

Saying if she lets her husband to have a SB but she\u2019s not allowed to have a lover, that\u2019s one sided - as you said that can be paid because she married a rich dude. \n\nI never check other peoples post history. I take their words at face value. I don\u2019t particularly try to find faults in people. \n\nWell, money comes first before husband is what gold diggers do right? \n\nI personally choose the guy first. And like I said , financial ability is a quality I\u2019d like my boyfriend to have. I say that because I am good financially and I expect him to be better. But if a wealthy man with bad characters, he won\u2019t pass my test or become my boyfriend either. So in my case, the man comes first before money. \n\nMany wage earners got married with kids and just look at how the population grow in big cities. Sorry not quite sure what you are trying to prove in your last paragraph. \n\nBy the way, some guys on seek look for wives actually. I don\u2019t think they care if their wives were sugar babies. Men and women are both on that app, why is it necessary that men are better than women by doing exactly the same thing? If many guys don\u2019t want to marry SBs , many SBs will judge SDs the same way. \n\nI definitely don\u2019t judge men on Seek. I met some decent gentlemen on Seek, fewer creeps than on bumble to be honest. Nothing wrong of being SDs or SBs. \n\nI only judge you if you cheat, manipulate or use other people as means to an end.

It\u2019s me looking for a lifelong partner not you so I define his greatness, not you. Just like I can\u2019t judge for you how good your girlfriend/wife is .. therefore, the great guy you said could not be so great to me. \n\nBut those not so great guys in my book have no problem of finding wives and have kids. Many girls would be proud that their husbands are lawyers, doctors earning 100k per year with a mortgage free house. So it doesn\u2019t matter if I don\u2019t find them great enough to date. I probably would consider dating a lawyer when I was 28, but I am 40 and my wealth doubled, a lawyer won\u2019t be earning enough to enjoy the lifestyle I want to have .. \n\nI am not on this Reddit all the time. But personally I met two guys on seek looking for marriage .. but just turned out they aren\u2019t great enough for me. So if they look for future wives on seek, they are definitely aware all the girls are potentially sugar babies. \n\nI don\u2019t feel being judged by any men I met on seek. I often filter out guys who are married (cheat) or open relationship so I don\u2019t see those profiles I have no clue if they judge. Honestly I\u2019d laugh If a cheat judges girls on seek. Lol \n\nThe rest that I end up meeting are all quite decent and non judgemental.. Well if you judge and think it\u2019s bad to marry a SB, you do you. You never really know your girlfriends history to be honest. You might think she\u2019s an angle (met her in the library , not on seek and she\u2019s in a white dress etc) but turned out she might have been a professional sex worker at night in the past year. \n\nAnd nowadays the hookup culture is so popular. I think most young chicks had a few dozen of dudes while they were pissed in a club. What difference it makes to sugaring? At least most sugar babies fuck their daddies soberly so they don\u2019t forget how to count their money .. \n\nIt\u2019s better you don\u2019t go search people\u2019s past and judge them harshly. It only matters what she\u2019s doing and how she makes you feel right now. But again you do you. Whatever makes you happy mate as we are all different.",

It\u2019s almost a way of doubting yourself - I don\u2019t know if I can be faithful in future or not so I am making a vow now to remind my weak self. \n\nLike making a promise publicly but weather you deliver or not, only time can tell.. \n\nA guy told me his wife has zero interests in sex but she won\u2019t allow him to get sex elsewhere. That\u2019s narcissistic. In the situation you said husband fuck around but won\u2019t let wife do, that\u2019s narcissistic too. It\u2019s all about control. \n\nAlthough it\u2019s toxic and unfair in my view, I know many people choose to be abused. The guy I know still stuck in his sexless marriage and the next 30 years it\u2019s only him and his hands .. he has a choice but he chose to stay with a narcissist. It\u2019s entirely the individuals choice. \n\nFinancial success is an important quality in a man to me when I select a mate but I don\u2019t care about his money. If one day he loses everything because of bad luck, I give him the financial help he needs to re-make it again. But if one day he becomes a drunk and loses his ambition, sorry I have to leave you for someone else. I love you for being you with all the qualities (the bad the good & the ugly) you have now, I didn\u2019t sign up to love a drunk loser. I hold the same expectation to myself. If he loves me for my compassion and kindness, he shouldn\u2019t love me if I become bitter and nasty one day. \n\nActually point 2&3 of yours illustrate a perfect sugar wife - taking his money for being in a one sided relationship. Anyway, money comes first before the husband. I guess it\u2019s none of my business so I don\u2019t really care why people marry.",

Saying if she lets her husband to have a SB but she\u2019s not allowed to have a lover, that\u2019s one sided - as you said that can be paid because she married a rich dude. \n\nI never check other peoples post history. I take their words at face value. I don\u2019t particularly try to find faults in people. \n\nWell, money comes first before husband is what gold diggers do right? \n\nI personally choose the guy first. And like I said , financial ability is a quality I\u2019d like my boyfriend to have. I say that because I am good financially and I expect him to be better. But if a wealthy man with bad characters, he won\u2019t pass my test or become my boyfriend either. So in my case, the man comes first before money. \n\nMany wage earners got married with kids and just look at how the population grow in big cities. Sorry not quite sure what you are trying to prove in your last paragraph. \n\nBy the way, some guys on seek look for wives actually. I don\u2019t think they care if their wives were sugar babies. Men and women are both on that app, why is it necessary that men are better than women by doing exactly the same thing? If many guys don\u2019t want to marry SBs , many SBs will judge SDs the same way. \n\nI definitely don\u2019t judge men on Seek. I met some decent gentlemen on Seek, fewer creeps than on bumble to be honest. Nothing wrong of being SDs or SBs. \n\nI only judge you if you cheat, manipulate or use other people as means to an end. Luckily not all people on seek cheat, manipulate or use people.",

It\u2019s me looking for a lifelong partner not you so I define his greatness, not you. Just like I can\u2019t judge for you how good your girlfriend/wife is .. therefore, the great guy you said could not be so great to me. \n\nBut those not so great guys in my book have no problem of finding wives and have kids. Many girls would be proud that their husbands are lawyers, doctors earning 100k per year with a mortgage free house. So it doesn\u2019t matter if I don\u2019t find them great enough to date. I probably would consider dating a lawyer when I was 28, but I am 40 and my wealth doubled, a lawyer won\u2019t be earning enough to enjoy the lifestyle I want to have .. \n\nI am not on this Reddit all the time. But personally I met two guys on seek looking for marriage .. but just turned out they aren\u2019t great enough for me. So if they look for future wives on seek, they are definitely aware all the girls are potentially sugar babies. \n\nI don\u2019t feel being judged by any men I met on seek. I often filter out guys who are married (cheat) or open relationship so I don\u2019t see those profiles I have no clue if they judge. Honestly I\u2019d laugh If a cheat judges girls on seek. Lol \n\nThe rest that I end up meeting are all quite decent and non judgemental.. Well if you judge and think it\u2019s bad to marry a SB, you do you. You never really know your girlfriends history to be honest. You might think she\u2019s an angle (met her in the library , not on seek and she\u2019s in a white dress etc) but turned out she might have been a professional sex worker at night in the past year. \n\nAnd nowadays the hookup culture is so popular. I think most young chicks had a few dozen of dudes while they were pissed in a club. What difference it makes to sugaring? At least most sugar babies fuck their daddies soberly so they don\u2019t forget how to count their money .. \n\nIt\u2019s better you don\u2019t go search people\u2019s past and judge them harshly. It only matters what she\u2019s doing and how she makes you feel right now. But again you do you. Whatever makes you happy mate as we are all different.",

It\u2019s almost a way of doubting yourself - I don\u2019t know if I can be faithful in future or not so I am making a vow now to remind my weak self. \n\nLike making a promise publicly but weather you deliver or not, only time can tell.. \n\nA guy told me his wife has zero interests in sex but she won\u2019t allow him to get sex elsewhere. That\u2019s narcissistic. In the situation you said husband fuck around but won\u2019t let wife do, that\u2019s narcissistic too. It\u2019s all about control. \n\nAlthough it\u2019s toxic and unfair in my view, I know many people choose to be abused. The guy I know still stuck in his sexless marriage and the next 30 years it\u2019s only him and his hands .. he has a choice but he chose to stay with a narcissist. It\u2019s entirely the individuals choice. \n\nFinancial success is an important quality in a man to me when I select a mate but I don\u2019t care about his money. If one day he loses everything because of bad luck, I give him the financial help he needs to re-make it again. But if one day he becomes a drunk and loses his ambition, sorry I have to leave you for someone else. I love you for being you with all the qualities (the bad the good & the ugly) you have now, I didn\u2019t sign up to love a drunk loser. I hold the same expectation to myself. If he loves me for my compassion and kindness, he shouldn\u2019t love me if I become bitter and nasty one day. \n\nActually point 2&3 of yours illustrate a perfect sugar wife - taking his money for being in a one sided relationship. Anyway, money comes first before the husband. I guess it\u2019s none of my business so I don\u2019t really care why people marry.",

Saying if she lets her husband to have a SB but she\u2019s not allowed to have a lover, that\u2019s one sided - as you said that can be paid because she married a rich dude. \n\nI never check other peoples post history. I take their words at face value. I don\u2019t particularly try to find faults in people. \n\nWell, money comes first before husband is what gold diggers do right? \n\nI personally choose the guy first. And like I said , financial ability is a quality I\u2019d like my boyfriend to have. I say that because I am good financially and I expect him to be better. But if a wealthy man with bad characters, he won\u2019t pass my test or become my boyfriend either. So in my case, the man comes first before money. \n\nMany wage earners got married with kids and just look at how the population grow in big cities. Sorry not quite sure what you are trying to prove in your last paragraph. \n\nBy the way, some guys on seek look for wives actually. I don\u2019t think they care if their wives were sugar babies. Men and women are both on that app, why is it necessary that men are better than women by doing exactly the same thing? If many guys don\u2019t want to marry SBs , many SBs will judge SDs the same way. \n\nI definitely don\u2019t judge men on Seek. I met some decent gentlemen on Seek, fewer creeps than on bumble to be honest. Nothing wrong of being SDs or SBs. \n\nI only judge you if you cheat, manipulate or use other people as means to an end. Luckily not all people on seek cheat, manipulate or use people.",

It\u2019s me looking for a lifelong partner not you so I define his greatness, not you. Just like I can\u2019t judge for you how good your girlfriend/wife is .. therefore, the great guy you said could not be so great to me. \n\nBut those not so great guys in my book have no problem of finding wives and have kids. Many girls would be proud that their husbands are lawyers, doctors earning 100k per year with a mortgage free house. So it doesn\u2019t matter if I don\u2019t find them great enough to date. I probably would consider dating a lawyer when I was 28, but I am 40 and my wealth doubled, a lawyer won\u2019t be earning enough to enjoy the lifestyle I want to have .. \n\nI am not on this Reddit all the time. But personally I met two guys on seek looking for marriage .. but just turned out they aren\u2019t great enough for me. So if they look for future wives on seek, they are definitely aware all the girls are potentially sugar babies. \n\nI don\u2019t feel being judged by any men I met on seek. I often filter out guys who are married (cheat) or open relationship so I don\u2019t see those profiles I have no clue if they judge. Honestly I\u2019d laugh If a cheat judges girls on seek. Lol \n\nThe rest that I end up meeting are all quite decent and non judgemental.. Well if you judge and think it\u2019s bad to marry a SB, you do you. You never really know your girlfriends history to be honest. You might think she\u2019s an angle (met her in the library , not on seek and she\u2019s in a white dress etc) but turned out she might have been a professional sex worker at night in the past year. \n\nAnd nowadays the hookup culture is so popular. I think most young chicks had a few dozen of dudes while they were pissed in a club. What difference it makes to sugaring? At least most sugar babies fuck their daddies soberly so they don\u2019t forget how to count their money .. \n\nIt\u2019s better you don\u2019t go search people\u2019s past and judge them harshly. It only matters what she\u2019s doing and how she makes you feel right now. But again you do you. Whatever makes you happy mate as we are all different.",
