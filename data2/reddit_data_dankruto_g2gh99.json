Pretty sure he was planning to kill Itachi while using Sasuke's body, and using some mental tactics as well like \"Like looky here, I got your younger bros body!\".",

And when he couldn't do that, he chose to settle for his little brother. Pretty sure he was planning to kill Itachi while using Sasuke's body, and using some mental tactics as well like \"Like looky here, I got your younger bros body!\".",
