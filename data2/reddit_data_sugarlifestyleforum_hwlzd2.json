    "body": "This is a rant, because i just saw a post about \u201cplatonic\u201d SBs on youtube and tik tok. Now that i have been an SB for a while, i get really offended when i hear a girl talking about wanting a sugar daddy but without giving any sugar. My friends know what i do and will tell me how they want an SD, but wouldn\u2019t do anything with them. If youre not into older men, dont fucking pretend like you are just for money. That is a scam, you are being a scammer. \n\nI also knew this one girl who would set up m&amp;g and then ghost them after their date (shed only choose men who\u2019d offer ppm on m&amp;g) and at first I was like... you do you, but now i am just disgusted by this behavior. \n\nGIRLS, BEING A SB IS NOT JUST FOR KICKS AND GIGGLES!!!! Do your research, figure out what you want, and if you dont want older man dick, DONT BE A FUCKING SBABY!!!\n\nEdit: Being a SB/SD is not like vanilla dating, it is not \u201ceasy\u201d. To the females/males who put in effort to finding and having a real genuine sugar relationship, I applaud and support you. I do not mean to bash any true SBs, and you know who you are. \nTo the scammers, johns, salt daddies, catfishers, fake SBs: STOP RUINING THE BOWL AND GET THE FLIP OUT :)",

This has a very bad impact on real SD/SB, and real SD/SB communication becomes very difficult. I have seen a lot of SB/SD information posted on social software, it is difficult for you to judge which is the real one. An SD once complained to me. He was cheated by too many SBs. He has been looking for it on social software. So I suggested that he try the sugar dating site. On the one hand, you can meet more people of the same kind on the sugar dating site. The real SB is more likely. On the other hand, the sugar dating site will perform identity verification when registering, which is safer and more reliable for SD/SB. In addition, becoming a member of the website will know more information than ordinary users, and it will be more protective for real SD/SB. Of course, if you just entered the sugar bowl and want to wait and see, social software can also satisfy you.",

It\u2019s my theory, for reasons I detailed in another post, that the supply of men willing to do that is slowly shrinking over time. The bowl is still a growing market, when it reaches a stable state, I think paid M&Gs will be a thing of the past. \n\nI\u2019ve been on WYP dates where I\u2019ve cheerfully paid for a date because sometimes I just want to grab a steak with a hottie when I\u2019m between SBs. But I rarely go on a second date with them because \u201cone and done\u201d is kinda the whole point of WYP \u2014 to me, anyway.",

It\u2019s my theory, for reasons I detailed in another post, that the supply of men willing to do that is slowly shrinking over time. The bowl is still a growing market, when it reaches a stable state, I think paid M&Gs will be a thing of the past. \n\nI\u2019ve been on WYP dates where I\u2019ve cheerfully paid for a date because sometimes I just want to grab a steak with a hottie when I\u2019m between SBs. But I rarely go on a second date with them because \u201cone and done\u201d is kinda the whole point of WYP \u2014 to me, anyway.",
