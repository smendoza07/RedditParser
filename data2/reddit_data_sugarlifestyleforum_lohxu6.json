If you feel the interaction was a waste of time, it's because the two of you wanted different things. Time wasting is definitely a problem, but this phrase just makes you look jaded without actually protecting your time. A better way to avoid time wastage might be specific guidance like \"Please don't message me unless X,Y, and Z.\"",
