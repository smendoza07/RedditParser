    "body": "Feeling kind of philosophical.   Not sure if this post has much of a point, but I felt like sharing.  Just in one of those moods.  \n\nI come from a lower middle class background, and my Dad needed to watch every penny.  Kind of went overboard, but that was a byproduct of living through the Great Depression.  Had to borrow money to afford engineering school and it took ten years to repay those loans.  So when I started out on my own, I had to be very careful with money.  Car was a beater, and lived in a modest apartment with second hand furniture.  \n\nAlong the way, I decided to start a tech company after getting an MBA, and managed to sell it a few years later for a modest of money.   But enough to build a respectable house and have some savings.   Started a second one, and sold it too.  This time for a lot more money.  Started another one, which has not had an exit yet.  When it does, it will likely dwarf the other two exits.  Also made some investments that have done very well.  So life has changed a lot over the years.\n\nI have a young SB who is just starting out.  She has brought me into her life in a way that I know a lot about her.  When she rents a new place, buys something new, or has a financial setback.  I watch her get excited when she thrifts an amazing new outfit for peanuts.  Or other simple things like finally getting a nice coffee table for her new place.  Which she want to share with me by sending pictures.  These \u201clittle\u201d things are a big deal to her, including \u201cminor\u201d things that enhance her room.  My God, I have forgotten what it was like to just have a room to live in.  \n\nThis has caused me to realize that I have kind of lost perspective on the difference between how life was and how it is now.  I never even think twice about anything I want.  I can just do it with no material impact to my lifestyle.  When stuff comes easy, the excitement kind of disappears.  Things are taken for granted.  Watching SB at her stage of life has caused me to look at myself and realize how fortunate I am.  And likely kind of callous to others whose life has not worked out so well.  I am thinking through what I am going to do about these feelings.  I am almost certain, I would not be thinking this way, if I had not started sugaring.  \n\nThe second part is the nostalgia.  Before all the \u201cbeen there, done that\u201d had set in.  Watching her has brought back a ton of memories about when I was going through the kinds of things she is experiencing now.  Like getting my first place, or having a serous \u201coh shit\u201d moment when the car breaks down and you don\u2019t want the financial hit of paying someone to fix it, so you fix it yourself. Those days had faded deep into memory, but they have been kind of brought back to life, as a result of knowing her so well.  \n\nI guess this is one of the by-products of a serious age gap.",

Like, the joys, the highs, the lows she feels are so far above/below the baseline you\u2019d experience without her that it gives you energy when you\u2019d otherwise just be going through the day like normal at that baseline?\n\nI feel like you\u2019d express this better than me but it\u2019s something more than one SB has said they see in me and how I react to their life experiences - I\u2019m elated by the highs, maybe more than they are; and drop everything to help someone I trust through the lows.",

                    "body": "Yes, the energy is real.  As you pass through life and navigate so many challenges, everything can be kind of mundane and old hat.  You just fall into this steady state of existing if you are not careful.\n\nShe does not have that steady state - she oscillates high and low, just like all young people, even though I think she is more extreme than most.  We have travelled together and on about the third trip, the relationship just went to another level, in that I think she finally thought of herself as an equal in the experiences we were creating together.   It no longer felt like I was a benefactor in any way.  We were just two people.   This took her highs to new places, and she drove an energy into me that I had almost forgotten how to experience.   Watching her be so excited about everything is and was intoxicating.  Way above my baseline as you put it.\n\nShe is also extremely sensitive, and prone to being hurt by people being jerks.  Especially if those are people she is close to.  I have been with her during these down times too.  A few times I have helped her overcome some of these situations.  Made me feel awesome when that happened. Pulled her through some lows as you put it.  \n\nSo you are bang on with the question about energy.  She has yanked me out of my steady state.  Not something she set out to do.  It just happened.",

She didn't realise that you can get people to try on cloths for you while you sit on the sofa drinking champagne....\n\nThat time when I just opened my banking app and transferred a large amount of money to her for her rent deposits, she just couldn't believe that I trusted her so much to do that. Even her own parents didn't have that kind of money to give her. She was touched with joy and that look of appreciation on her face I will never forget. \n\nAnd when she broke down on the motor way going to a music event, I just called AA and used my membership to her out of trouble. She couldn't believe that I could actually help her from the other side of the world (I was away on business in China). To her, I was like the omnipresent omnipotent God!\n\nYeah I miss those days.",

            "body": "I came from a similar background. My mother passed when I was a few months old and my father remarried. He eventually remarried and over time he became abusive and my stepmom was an alcoholic. Most of my teenage years I was bouncing around friends\u2019 homes and at times essentially homeless, but thankfully not on the streets, as I was blessed to have friends with stable parents at home. My father was MIA after age 14 or so, which was for the best. I haven\u2019t spoken to him in over 20 years. \n\nLong story short, I grew up with no structure or stability and no father figure to guide me through becoming a man. Therefore I started everything in life a lot later including discovering who I was and what I was capable of achieving. Life was hard but it molded me into a self sufficient, always choose action mindset, and perhaps most importantly, built up my tolerance to endure pain. That ability to handle pain and shrug off life\u2019s punches helped me to will myself to success in my mid thirties (in my forties now). \n\nAll that to say I have never forgotten where I came from and take what I have for granted. The key is always to do what you did with this post. Pause and take a step back to reflect and regain your perspective. That pain and suffering in childhood and the hard road to make something out of yourself from nothing is the foundation that keeps you grounded to reality. When life starts losing its joy or you find yourself shrugging off the life that you willed into existence as if it wasn\u2019t a big deal, that\u2019s a signal that you\u2019ve lost perspective and need to re-ground yourself back to reality. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how you keep your life perspective as long as you have a method to constantly pull you back in and stay grounded. It looks like dating a young SB that\u2019s finding her way in life is yours. I can\u2019t think of anything better than that \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd42",

It used to represents freedom and safety. But watching my sugar daddies over the years, one richer than the other, I dunno. One of them has a drinking problem and is going through a major identity crisis, which is turning into anxiety etc. The other one seems to be clinging into every bit of youth he has left, and can't relate to anything I say unless it has something to do with money or expensive hobbies. \n\n\nMoney is problems, whether you have little or a lot. Life is pain anyway, so why bother to fight for more than you you need? I just want to afford to put the heater on without worrying about the electrical bill, and maybe the occasional luxury vacation. But that's about it",

The guy who can\u2019t relate, would likely be that way, whether he had money or not.\n\nSecondly, I would highly recommend you look well into the future, and see how much money you are going to need to comfortably live come retirement or god forbid, to deal with a nasty shock like millions are feeling right now.  Many people do not properly plan so that they can have a comfortable future.  \n\nFinally, on the \u201cwhy bother fighting\u201d front, you can avoid that trade if you pursue something that excites you AND can be financially rewarding at the same time.   In my case, money was never the driving factor in putting myself through the craziness and stress of starting companies.  It was just something I had to do, to feel fulfilled.  So ya, there was a big fight, but I wanted it.  \n\nThe financial gain was secondary.  But let me tell you, there is a bunch of comfort knowing that an event like Covid cannot destroy your lifestyle.  I have a wife with health problems.  We make it better by being able to afford support for her.   Support that is going to get more and more expensive.  Curveballs like that can ruin lives if you cannot afford to effectively deal with them, when they surprise you.\n\nJust another point of view I think.",

I was riding out the Great Recession in college, and fell into a relationship with a 19 y/o, when I was 39. She was from a religious cult and frankly used me to mainstream herself. She knew exactly what she was doing.  We had an almost 5 year run, and broke up with love when she went to grad school. 10/10, would do again. \n\nYou are way more financially successful than I am. That stuff I don't relate to. But everything else you said, the little things and the big things, oh yeah, absolutely. \n\nHonestly, she changed my life. The first time we went wilderness backpacking, it was a shit show. The last time we went, we were dialed in. Honestly, helping her get on better paths helped me get on better paths. \n\nI haven't been able to bring myself to getting into the Bowl because I'd have to be decidedly salty to do it. The problem is that this damned plague has made \"warm approach\" (using eye contact and smiles as cues) virtually impossible right now. I keep telling myself that as long as I'm up front (i.e. putting \"this place is Tinder to me\" in my profile) I'd likely to be screened out by serious SB's and pick up the bored ones (I'm conventionally attractive, living alone in my apartment, legit single.)\n\nI am so absolutely hooked on the youthful energy and enthusiasm, though. I am just not interested in women my age. To be fair, the feelings fairly mutual. I'm useless to them.",

We have travelled together and on about the third trip, the relationship just went to another level, in that I think she finally thought of herself as an equal in the experiences we were creating together.   It no longer felt like I was a benefactor in any way.  We were just two people.   This took her highs to new places, and she drove an energy into me that I had almost forgotten how to experience.   Watching her be so excited about everything is and was intoxicating.  Way above my baseline as you put it.\n\nShe is also extremely sensitive, and prone to being hurt by people being jerks.  Especially if those are people she is close to.  I have been with her during these down times too.  A few times I have helped her overcome some of these situations.  Made me feel awesome when that happened. Pulled her through some lows as you put it.  \n\nSo you are bang on with the question about energy.  She has yanked me out of my steady state.

The guy who can\u2019t relate, would likely be that way, whether he had money or not.\n\nSecondly, I would highly recommend you look well into the future, and see how much money you are going to need to comfortably live come retirement or god forbid, to deal with a nasty shock like millions are feeling right now.  Many people do not properly plan so that they can have a comfortable future.  \n\nFinally, on the \u201cwhy bother fighting\u201d front, you can avoid that trade if you pursue something that excites you AND can be financially rewarding at the same time.   In my case, money was never the driving factor in putting myself through the craziness and stress of starting companies.  It was just something I had to do, to feel fulfilled.  So ya, there was a big fight, but I wanted it.  \n\nThe financial gain was secondary.  But let me tell you, there is a bunch of comfort knowing that an event like Covid cannot destroy your lifestyle.  I have a wife with health problems.  We make it better by being able to afford support for her.   Support that is going to get more and more expensive.  Curveballs like that can ruin lives if you cannot afford to effectively deal with them, when they surprise you.\n\nJust another point of view I think.",

But no longer, given what has happened to me in this arrangement.  It is life changing.  \n\nWe are in different cities, but either talk live or text every day.  Today had been especially cute.  She is all excited about a band she is currently obsessed with.  Sent me a song and wanted to know if I had heard of them.  The freakin Mama\u2019s and Papa\u2019s from the 60\u2019s!  I am visiting her in a couple of weeks, and we are going to get aerial footage with this new drone I just bought.  Of all things, she is excited about us editing a movie together with \u201cour\u201d footage.  Her enthusiasm for almost everything is intoxicating.  \n\nOf course, all of this interlaced with how much she is looking forward to cuddling and hugging.
