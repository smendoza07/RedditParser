    "body": "It\u2019s 1:25 am and I\u2019m lying on my couch replaying the scenes from my date with my SB earlier tonight.\n\nIt was another date full of laughter and cuddles and I suddenly find tears welling up in my eyes because finally in a long time, I found someone who makes me happy.\n\nI\u2019ve gone about my 20s dedicating my life to work. I stopped looking for relationships and have gone for years without being with anyone. I would find someone and it just wouldn\u2019t work out. And eventually I just stopped trying and got used to doing things by myself.\n\nSuddenly in my 30s, I found myself uprooting my single life and moving to the US to help rebuild a team. While my career path is now set, I also found myself alone, without family and friends in a new country.\n\nEventually I discovered the sugar bowl and made big mistakes with my first two SRs. And then out of nowhere, my current SB appeared in my DMs. Little did I know, she would go on to create this big impact in my life.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing how getting a text message from her would relieve a stressful day at work, looking at her pictures would put this big smile on my face and thinking about past conversations would give me a chuckle or two.\n\nWith her in the picture, my life finally feels... complete. Work while stressful is projecting me towards my career goals and in my personal life, I finally found someone who\u2019s able to give me the companionship, affection, emotional connection, physical intimacy and friendship I need in my life right now.\n\nUnfortunately my immigration status remains up in the air with the current administration which is why I cannot commit to anyone right now and prefer sugar dating over vanilla.\n\nWhile I know SRs may not last forever, I still get anxiety issues every now and then that this incredible SR I have with my SB will end one day.\n\nBut if our SR ever comes to an end, I will wish her well, happiness and love and I will always carry with me the happy memories we\u2019ve had together. But until then, I will be here for as long as I can and I will do my best to give her all the happiness she deserves.\n\nTo my beautiful and amazing SB, I found a wonderful friend in you. And I cannot thank you enough for the joy you\u2019ve brought to my life. \u2764\ufe0f",
