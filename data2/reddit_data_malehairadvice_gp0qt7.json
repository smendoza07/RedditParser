Also, make sure you're not using a boar bristle brush, they're the type with the \"plugs\" of nylon/horsehair fibers. Use a \"Wet brush\" type instead, with the metal pegs, and only brush your hair while you're in the shower and have conditioner in your hair.\n\nThat's pretty much all covered under the CGM guide on /r/curlyhair, so I'd suggest going and checking that subreddit out. You've got some *great* texture to your hair so you could definitely have some defined curls pretty fast.",
