    "body": "Not even upset, honestly just in shock. A few days ago during a very nice and fun evening together, we had what I thought was a very normal, calm, and respectful discussion about politics. I can\u2019t remember exactly how it got brought up but it was not an argument, there was no yelling or name calling or hostility. I knew prior to this that we had different views on certain things and I wasn\u2019t bothered by it. I thought based on previous conversations over the course of the past 3.5 months that he was aware of that too. Nothing he said came as a shock to me, he didn\u2019t seem upset by anything that I said, and I honestly didn\u2019t give the conversation a second thought until today. \n\nLiterally out of the blue (we were in the middle of making plans for the week, which he initiated), he sent me a long text saying that he thought it over and he can\u2019t continue with me because of my \u201cextreme\u201d views (I really do not think I said anything super out there but whatever) and things aren\u2019t going to be the same. He then ended by essentially saying that most men share his views even if they say they don\u2019t, implying that I should get on board with his views if I want to find a man to date, and then wished me luck in my studies. I just replied saying wow all right then, sorry to hear that, best of luck to you. \n\nHonestly I was thinking about ending things for other reasons so I guess it worked out for the best, but I\u2019m just in shock because of how out of left field this was. He\u2019s picked plenty of fights with me and we\u2019ve successfully talked through all kinds of stuff so I just find it wild that out of all of our conversations, this one was apparently the kiss of death. Oh well \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nEDIT/Update: he now appears to be second guessing his decision (?) and is texting me every few minutes with unnecessary shit (like nothing of substance whatsoever). I\u2019m not really trying to engage, not sure what his endgame is but I\u2019m getting pretty weirded out",

That system was the basis of this place\u2019s economy for longer than it\u2019s been \u201cabolished\u201d at this point.\n\nPlus, the 13th amendment still allows for ensl*vement of criminals.  Racial minorities are over-policed and over-respresented in every single way in the legal system.  It\u2019s a loophole.\n\nLook at outcomes by demographic in literally any area.  Look at the policy history against racial minorities, from paying sc*lp bounties on Native Americans to redlining.  To conclude anything other than our country is still segregated in practice is intellectually dishonest.\n\nNative Americans are still being arrested, placed under house arrest, and threatened with imprisonment for protesting against dangerous pipelines that are being illegally installed on THEIR UNCEDED land.\n\nI don\u2019t understand how grown adults who are even remotely capable of critical thought can be so insistent that the treatment of racial minorities in this country is anything other than devastatingly prejudicial.\n\nhttps://www.nationalobserver.com/2020/01/24/analysis/what-we-mean-when-we-say-indigenous-land-unceded",

He later got pissed and denied it all, and I just roll my eyes and let him think his gaslighting worked, because I don\u2019t fucking care tbh.\n\nLike dude, just own it. It\u2019s ok, just own it. Having different views is okay, and also letting those views be flexible is wise.

Now, the left has moved so far left that I find myself agreeing with people like Ben Shapiro more than I do with those on the left that I once align myself with. \n\nTake transgenderism for an example. I support the rights of transgender individuals to express themselves however they wish to do so. However, the idea that they should be able to then compel speech on others is ludicrous and borderline thought policing. Yet, every PSB I met in the states was adamant that a transwoman is actually female... which she is not. She is biologically male. Self identifying as something does not change the reality in which we live. It's like identifying yourself as being thin and then demanding everyone else see you as being thin when you are in fact 200 lbs. overweight. For someone such as myself that did not grow up with such a narrative, the entire concept is ludicrously radical.\n\nI have always enjoyed spirited debate though, and as long as the PSB understands that I won't change my views without them being able to persuade me that I am wrong. However, I also know that most people do not like spirited debate and are not looking for such in a potential SR. As such, I think ending a SR in which you are politically unaligned is not surprising.",

That system was the basis of this place\u2019s economy for longer than it\u2019s been \u201cabolished\u201d at this point.\n\nPlus, the 13th amendment still allows for ensl*vement of criminals.  Racial minorities are over-policed and over-respresented in every single way in the legal system.  It\u2019s a loophole.\n\nLook at outcomes by demographic in literally any area.  Look at the policy history against racial minorities, from paying sc*lp bounties on Native Americans to redlining.  To conclude anything other than our country is still segregated in practice is intellectually dishonest.\n\nNative Americans are still being arrested, placed under house arrest, and threatened with imprisonment for protesting against dangerous pipelines that are being illegally installed on THEIR UNCEDED land.\n\nI don\u2019t understand how grown adults who are even remotely capable of critical thought can be so insistent that the treatment of racial minorities in this country is anything other than devastatingly prejudicial.\n\nhttps://www.nationalobserver.com/2020/01/24/analysis/what-we-mean-when-we-say-indigenous-land-unceded",

Having different views is okay, and also letting those views be flexible is wise.

Also just depends on the amount of conviction they have in what they are saying, lack of that tells you that they are just saying what they think you want to hear so they can get laid. Also the fact that a lot of times they think they know what I want to hear but really they don\u2019t and if you disagree they immediately backtrack \ud83d\ude02 can be a dead giveaway",

That system was the basis of this place\u2019s economy for longer than it\u2019s been \u201cabolished\u201d at this point.\n\nPlus, the 13th amendment still allows for ensl*vement of criminals.  Racial minorities are over-policed and over-respresented in every single way in the legal system.  It\u2019s a loophole.\n\nLook at outcomes by demographic in literally any area.  Look at the policy history against racial minorities, from paying sc*lp bounties on Native Americans to redlining.  To conclude anything other than our country is still segregated in practice is intellectually dishonest.\n\nNative Americans are still being arrested, placed under house arrest, and threatened with imprisonment for protesting against dangerous pipelines that are being illegally installed on THEIR UNCEDED land.\n\nI don\u2019t understand how grown adults who are even remotely capable of critical thought can be so insistent that the treatment of racial minorities in this country is anything other than devastatingly prejudicial.\n\nhttps://www.nationalobserver.com/2020/01/24/analysis/what-we-mean-when-we-say-indigenous-land-unceded",

Look at the policy history against racial minorities, from paying sc*lp bounties on Native Americans to redlining.  To conclude anything other than our country is still segregated in practice is intellectually dishonest.\n\nNative Americans are still being arrested, placed under house arrest, and threatened with imprisonment for protesting against dangerous pipelines that are being illegally installed on THEIR UNCEDED land.\n\nI don\u2019t understand how grown adults who are even remotely capable of critical thought can be so insistent that the treatment of racial minorities in this country is anything other than devastatingly prejudicial.\n\nhttps://www.nationalobserver.com/2020/01/24/analysis/what-we-mean-when-we-say-indigenous-land-unceded",

That system was the basis of this place\u2019s economy for longer than it\u2019s been \u201cabolished\u201d at this point.\n\nPlus, the 13th amendment still allows for ensl*vement of criminals.  Racial minorities are over-policed and over-respresented in every single way in the legal system.  It\u2019s a loophole.\n\nLook at outcomes by demographic in literally any area.  Look at the policy history against racial minorities, from paying sc*lp bounties on Native Americans to redlining.  To conclude anything other than our country is still segregated in practice is intellectually dishonest.\n\nNative Americans are still being arrested, placed under house arrest, and threatened with imprisonment for protesting against dangerous pipelines that are being illegally installed on THEIR UNCEDED land.\n\nI don\u2019t understand how grown adults who are even remotely capable of critical thought can be so insistent that the treatment of racial minorities in this country is anything other than devastatingly prejudicial.\n\nhttps://www.nationalobserver.com/2020/01/24/analysis/what-we-mean-when-we-say-indigenous-land-unceded",
