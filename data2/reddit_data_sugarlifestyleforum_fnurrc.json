    "body": "I\u2019m kind of surprised at the amount of newbie sugar babies trying to dip in the bowl right now. In my opinion, from a sugar baby standpoint, you shouldn\u2019t be entering a sugar relationship out of desperation. It gives SB\u2019s a bad name. More often than not if a POT gets the impression that you are desperate for cash (what we call crisis babies) they\u2019ll either try to take advantage of you, or won\u2019t be interested. \nNo you should not schedule or follow through with a meet and greet. No \u201conline arrangements\u201d are not a good idea. This is simply not the time to be actively looking for a sugar daddy.",

You\u2019re risking alot more than a regular job. No job is worth your mental well being that goes for both janitors and sex workers. I don\u2019t think sacrificing your dignity is a healthy message to send. If you have mental hang ups about sugaring, if you feel guilty about it, then you shouldn\u2019t be doing it for the sake of your own well being",

Many woman are attracted to their SD, many women enjoy the company of their SD, and many even look for ways to spend additional time with their SD without looking for additional compensation.   \n\n\n>These girls are just looking out for themselves and that's bad for everybody's business. Basically the regular assholes trying to get a easy buck\n\nSome girls are only looking out for themselves. Most of the time, if a man has any real world experience with women, he can spot users, and those that are only there for themselves. Unlike a regular vanilla relationship where a man has to do all the work to win over a women, with sugar relationships, it's mutually b beneficial, if a women is not looking out for her SDs happiness, she will get cut loose, and will easily be replaced. Whereas in vanilla relationships men tend to hold onto toxic women for fear of them not being easily replaced. Sugar is the great equalizer in male / female relationships and makes a woman pull her weight in the relationship.",

A lot of SBs are educated, smart, and can make their own money to sustain themselves but choose to sugar to either invest in their business or not have to work a traditional 9-5. I would not discourage anyone in a time of need to not do what they have to do but I just don\u2019t see how it could be done safely. Predators are out preying on desperate women and there is very few places to meet in public. You can\u2019t make money if you dead. This is why I believe in multiple streams of income including a job, multiple long term SDs etc. Most of these SD relationships only last 2-3 months then SBs are scrambling to find another SD. I have two arrangements right now. One for 2 and a half years and another for a year and a few months. A lot of SBs think it\u2019s cute to go from one SD to another every two months but what they don\u2019t understand is that it\u2019s the long term arrangements that will really help you when you are going through a hard time financially. For new SBs it\u2019s definitely a difficult time to try to start sugaring safely.",

You probably should not make judgments on things you haven't actually participated in/\n\n>it's a business arrangement \n\nNo, its a relationship arrangement. Just like before you get married, and you have a conversation, about who will take care of the financial responsibilities, who will do the cleaning chores, or any other discussions about sex, birth control, children etc. \n\n>it's not for fun otherwise there wouldn't be an exchange of goods. \n\nAll relationships between a man and a women have an exchange of goods. \n\nAlso, regardless of whether there is an exchange of goods or not, how do you know it's not fun otherwise? Many woman are attracted to their SD, many women enjoy the company of their SD, and many even look for ways to spend additional time with their SD without looking for additional compensation.   \n\n\n>These girls are just looking out for themselves and that's bad for everybody's business. Basically the regular assholes trying to get a easy buck\n\nSome girls are only looking out for themselves. Most of the time, if a man has any real world experience with women, he can spot users, and those that are only there for themselves. Unlike a regular vanilla relationship where a man has to do all the work to win over a women, with sugar relationships, it's mutually b beneficial, if a women is not looking out for her SDs happiness, she will get cut loose, and will easily be replaced. Whereas in vanilla relationships men tend to hold onto toxic women for fear of them not being easily replaced. Sugar is the great equalizer in male / female relationships and makes a woman pull her weight in the relationship.",

Not only can they can scammed or manipulated, but they can also end up being very needy and demanding, and not the type of SB that most SD want.

That\u2019s such chicken shit lol.\n\nWith that logic you are saying janitors enjoy or want to clean shit on toilets? I would say the vast majority or janitors don\u2019t enjoy their jobs, but they have to as means to live. Not everyone can afford to have jobs they want to do or enjoy, and that\u2019s okay! Sometimes jobs are stepping stones to bigger things. Sugar is not the exception. Some girls may not want to sugar but are using it as means to put themselves through college.",

You\u2019re risking alot more than a regular job. No job is worth your mental well being that goes for both janitors and sex workers. I don\u2019t think sacrificing your dignity is a healthy message to send. If you have mental hang ups about sugaring, if you feel guilty about it, then you shouldn\u2019t be doing it for the sake of your own well being",

Many woman are attracted to their SD, many women enjoy the company of their SD, and many even look for ways to spend additional time with their SD without looking for additional compensation.   \n\n\n>These girls are just looking out for themselves and that's bad for everybody's business. Basically the regular assholes trying to get a easy buck\n\nSome girls are only looking out for themselves. Most of the time, if a man has any real world experience with women, he can spot users, and those that are only there for themselves. Unlike a regular vanilla relationship where a man has to do all the work to win over a women, with sugar relationships, it's mutually b beneficial, if a women is not looking out for her SDs happiness, she will get cut loose, and will easily be replaced. Whereas in vanilla relationships men tend to hold onto toxic women for fear of them not being easily replaced. Sugar is the great equalizer in male / female relationships and makes a woman pull her weight in the relationship.",
