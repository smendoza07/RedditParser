    "body": "This thread is advice for SD's talking to or trying to attract a black or mixed SB. I'm honestly just trying to tell you what turns me/ many of us off so you can avoid it.\n\n1. Anything using the word exotic. It's always exoticization and it's always uncomfortable. I'm not exotic, I'm me. Am I to assume that means I look different than a traditionally attractive white female? Because, uh, yes. I am. I know it. You know it. Let's move on.\n2. I love black/mixed/POC girls. This is honestly just so weird. If you messaged a white woman and you just said \"I love white women\" they would be freaked the hell out, and rightly so. Treat me as me, not a cachet item. If you're looking to attract a black woman, some coded ways for her to know you might be a safe option for her are:\n\n* I'm very liberal\n* I'm open-minded\n* using the all ethnicities tag on Seeking\n* general compliments on my appearance\n\n1. Never ever (even out of curiosity) ask if they've done race play before with any SDs. This is often read as a sign that that's what you want, and that discomfort carries forward, even if it's not brought up again.\n2. Don't ask if I have a dad in my life (unless you're talking about family). I was actually born in a test tube and am baffled by the concept of fatherhood /s\n3. Don't compare my skin or hair to food. If I hear the word chocolate to describe me, I'm probably not responding because I'm in my bathroom gagging. It's contrived.\n\nBlack & mixed SBs, please feel free to add to this list in the comments.  \n\n\nEDIT: Sorry about the numbering being off. It's messing with me too, but Reddit keeps autocorrecting it to this.",

My parents are immigrants and I was born & raised in the US. I am American but well connected to my culture and very educated about my family traditions / religion. i\u2019ve had SDs try and shove me into the exotic/un-American box which I\u2019m clearly not and others that try and shove me into the \u201ceducated to erase her savage customs\u201d/completely Americanized box and I\u2019m not that either!\n\nPlease understand that bashing my culture by saying how American I am is not a compliment because it\u2019s part of my identity, I can be both things at once! It\u2019s not flattery to say wow you\u2019re so much more like the white ideal than I thought you\u2019d be... that\u2019s like telling a light skin Black woman that she\u2019s \u201cone of the pretty ones\u201d because of her skin tone, it\u2019s disgusting. This whole rhetoric that you want us but not the cultural and racial identities that we come attached to, or that we have rejected them for whiteness is just so wrong and weird coming from a white person. It\u2019s like mansplaining menstruation to a woman. \n\nThis is a recent [post ](https://www.removeddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/igd9rs/aita_for_flipping_a_drink_on_my_date/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)that blew up on Reddit (edit: I see that this is removed, but you can still view it w/ removeddit now that I modified the link) that closely describes something that\u2019s happened to me before minus the drink flipping lol. It\u2019s pretty invalidating because the SD had never experienced my culture or grew up with it himself, so how can you make judgements on entire countries' beliefs and ways of life?\n\nIt\u2019s also hard to speak up and correct an SD in fear that I might offend them or imply that their thought is racist (it might have come from from an ignorant/entitled place) when they hold a lot of power in the relationship. I\u2019d love to have more open discussions about race with SDs, and if you\u2019re in doubt if saying something is okay, just ask! I\u2019d love to tell you how I feel about something in reference to myself and have an interesting discussion about race/culture :) The goal isn\u2019t to make anyone uncomfortable, but if you are it\u2019s because you\u2019re learning comparing behaviors you know are wrong to your own actions (and this really isn\u2019t just a generational thing, everyone should treat others with respect, I feel like labeling offended SBs as SJWs or too liberal is just another way of undermining their experiences with racists in the bowl)",

Quite practically, it\u2019s been invaluable in my work to find ways to connect with younger people and motivate them. \n\nEven with the BLM movement, while I understand and agree with the reasons behind the movement, experiencing the extreme emotions it\u2019s caused in my current SB in real time has really opened my eyes, more than I think they would have otherwise been opened, to the importance of this movement in America.",

It certainly wasn't ever ill-intended, if anything, I was trying to become more educated but I look back and just cringe at some of my ignorant comments.\n\nI'm so glad you made this post because I would have benefited greatly from reading this earlier in my life. Sometimes trying to be politically correct and open-minded still ends with us putting our foot in our mouths. The guy I've dated the longest is Colombian and often makes little comments that he likes my skin or hair and even that makes me wonder if that's my appeal to him, so I cannot imagine what it's like to deal with that every day.",

My genre of bdsm is normally very light on degradation, so it felt a little uncomfortable to me, but she seemed to ummm \"enjoy\" it, and that is the primary focus of my own genre, so that fulfilled me that she did.  But yes, can certainly understand the taboo feeling, it is taboo in a world that doesn't bat an eye at say, incest play(as a fantasy), so there you go. Glad you enjoyed yourself. :)",

We need to get away from this whole Us vs. Them mentality that serves to hinder discussion and moving things forward.    \n\n\nAs the poster herself quite eloquently pointed out, she would just as soon lose her lunch in the bathroom than to use such language, so I seriously doubt such a large population of people would willingly describe themselves in such a manner when they could simply feel out the situation and -then- tailor their responses towards whatever fantasy they feel they need to stomach for the sake of an arrangement.  Let us not forget to include the women out there that actually and truly love being compared to food or considered to be exotic.  To do otherwise would be to try and claim that their particular fetish is somehow invalid or shameful.  No one person can speak for everyone.",

My genre of bdsm is normally very light on degradation, so it felt a little uncomfortable to me, but she seemed to ummm \"enjoy\" it, and that is the primary focus of my own genre, so that fulfilled me that she did.  But yes, can certainly understand the taboo feeling, it is taboo in a world that doesn't bat an eye at say, incest play(as a fantasy), so there you go. Glad you enjoyed yourself. :)",

Let us not forget to include the women out there that actually and truly love being compared to food or considered to be exotic.

I will say your OP is based solely upon your preference but shouldn\u2019t be the theme for every black SB. \n\nThere are plenty of black women who enjoy being objectified, called chocolate, exotic, and will be brave enough to say fuck the status quo and taboo I wanna experience race play.  Is there anything wrong with them/us? Nope. Do we fit into your sentiment of disgust? Nope. \n\nSo although I can understand your position, like the other poster said, this this is not a one size fits all matter and you should accept the diversity in that instead of making it yet another contentious issue. \n\nOkay, you don\u2019t like it. So what? Stick with what you like and sugar happily.",
