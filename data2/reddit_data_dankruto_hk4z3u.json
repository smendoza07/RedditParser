Ye he def never trained and totally got all his skill just handed to him. \n\nI like Naruto obviously, who\u2019s not only a Uzumaki with inhuman amounts of chakra, but he also has one (and at the end all) tailed beast inside of him who gives him his entire power after some \u201ctalk no Jutsu\u201d\nAnd at least he doesn\u2019t have some OP mode... Additional to all of Kuramas power, he also has a technique where he can store even more chakra and get more OP \n\nYes Sasuke def doesn\u2019t deserve shit, Kishimoto made him way too OP ;^)",

Ye he def never trained and totally got all his skill just handed to him. \n\nI like Naruto obviously, who\u2019s not only a Uzumaki with inhuman amounts of chakra, but he also has one (and at the end all) tailed beast inside of him who gives him his entire power after some \u201ctalk no Jutsu\u201d\nAnd at least he doesn\u2019t have some OP mode... Additional to all of Kuramas power, he also has a technique where he can store even more chakra and get more OP \n\nYes Sasuke def doesn\u2019t deserve shit, Kishimoto made him way too OP ;^)",

Additional to all of Kuramas power, he also has a technique where he can store even more chakra and get more OP \n\nYes Sasuke def doesn\u2019t deserve shit, Kishimoto made him way too OP ;^)",
