    "body": "[Previous Update #3](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/12ry5ej/update_3_wheelie_girl_i_survived/)\n\nApologies to Wheelie Girl fans for late update. Reason is our 4th date there was nothing too weird or crazy to report. We met for lunch and after went for a walk while holding hands. She did wear the wheelies again and showed off her moves,,I thought about taking video for Reddit but felt weird to ask. After the date WG sent me a sweet text message thanking me and that she is grateful for my help. She does not realize I am selling Wheelie Girl t-shirts and merchandise to subsidize her allowance. Jk,,,but that\u2019s good idea. \n\nShe also said she wants to show appreciation and try something on next date for me,,,some fruit rollup trend. I said ok but I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking about. She said don\u2019t worry she will take care of it.  \n\nWe meet 2 days later for another date and WG is wearing a cute outfit,,short skirt and tights and previous Doctor Marty shoes and small backpack. Not appropriate for formal but we did not go to fancy restaurant,,just bbq. We go back to our hotel and as soon as we shut the door she gives me a Minions sleepmask and blindfolds me,,then pulls down my pants. I hear some fumbling and weird noises and think she is putting on the condom but she wasn\u2019t. I ask what\u2019s going on and she says \u201cshut up and just be patient.\u201d  \n\nI feel it that she puts something sticky on my peen and is massaging and squeezing it like clay\u2026\u2026\u2026.I don\u2019t know how to explain or describe what happens next,,,but *&$!%#\u00a3&$!!  After we finish I tell her we should do this every date and ask how did she learn this. She said it\u2019s very popular now and some girls buy boxes of fruit rollups.  \n\nLater I went to use bathroom and WG told me not to go in because she just used it. I waited 10 minutes and the bathroom was still stinky. \ud83d\udca9  I won\u2019t take her to bbq anymore.",
