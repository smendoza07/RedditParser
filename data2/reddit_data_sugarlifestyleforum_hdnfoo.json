    "body": "During the summer of 2016, I joined seeking arrangement as a fresh high-school graduate when I was 18. I was working at a fast food restaurant then, and I valued money over most things. I thought I'd share some of my failed experiences so that those young and inexperienced won't be taken advantage of. \n\nDisclaimer: When I entered the bowl, I did do my research by reading articles, but I really lacked street smarts and life experiences. \n\n**Using Real Email** \\- At least I didn't use a real name on my profile, but I received a message saying, \"Hi <insert my profile name>, or should I say <insert my real name>?\" I deleted my account so fast after that message. I don't think SA gives your email address out, but this dude came from a computer science background, so he probably figured it out that way.\n\n**Giving Out Your Real Phone Number** \\- Some men are legit creeps. I went on ONE movie / dinner date with a guy from SA June 2016 , and I'm so dumb for not recognizing this, but his pillow was covering like a big chunk of his face, so he was heavier than I had expected. Instead of being upfront about not being attracted to him, I proceeded to quote him a non-negotiable outrageous monthly allowance amount. This dude then texted me September 2016 and pretty much every 2 months thereafter until March 2018. Also tried to add me on FaceBook... Do men just not take a hint if they don't  receive a response after 5+ tries?\n\n**Physical Intimacy during Meet & Greet** \\- Maan I stupidly met up with this man at his hotel. This is 100% a red flag for a M&G, but I was naive. He asked for a blow job and called it an \"audition,\" and I stupidly thought this was a part of the process. It was disgustingly salty. :)) Oh btw, I failed the \"audition\". LOL\n\n**Physical Intimacy before Allowance Talks** \\- If you want to have intercourse with this person because of pure attraction, great, but don't do it expecting an allowance / PPM afterwards. I was really bad about bringing up money, and I basically put out thinking an allowance talk might come after. What I didn't realize then was that some men on SA don't do PPM or an allowance - they think that taking you out to eat constitutes as spoiling you, which is so ridiculous. Oooh and this occurred June 2016. This individual tried to friend me on Facebook and message me there early 2020. :)) Yes, because 4 years and a degree later, I'd still be an idiot. \n\n**Catching Feelings** \\- I met this 32-year old ***married*** man, and for the first time, I was actually physically attracted to someone on SA. From July - August, we spent every single day together since his wife and kids were out of the country then. He sent me cash after our first intimate moment, but we were both new to the site, so we had not discussed any allowance continuation. I didn't care because I just enjoyed spending time with him, and we said \"I love you,\" pretty quickly. For an entire year, I placed myself on an emotional roller coaster, until I snapped, and psychotically made a fake male social media profile, added his wife, and pretended as if I was the boyfriend of myself and that her husband was cheating with my girlfriend (aka me). His wife still didn't want to leave him, though. He finally moved out August 2017, and we were together until late 2019. I don't have much regrets about our relationship, but I do wish I didn't act so selfishly towards his wife.. Moral of the story: ***DO NOT CATCH FEELINGS FOR A MARRIED MAN***. I now avoid all married men because it's not healthy for my own relationships, and I think it's bad karma to hurt another person emotionally again.",

I\u2019ve met a SD where his previous relationship lasted years, and he would\u2019ve married her, but she didn\u2019t want to and had to go back to her home country due to visa issues.
