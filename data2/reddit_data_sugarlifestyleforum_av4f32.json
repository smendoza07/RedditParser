    "body": "There are many posts on this forum often from less experienced SBs asking for advice how to approach a first meet and greet, what to do if he wants to go faster / further than she wants, how to define boundaries, how to ask for allowance, and how to say \"no\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSometimes I forget how I felt when I was way younger and had encounters with much older and much more powerful people. No, sex was not involved which made it much simpler, regardless I usually wanted something from them. A good grade, a good job, a recommendation, a promotion.\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI forgot how insecure I was just asking for something I nowadays know I had every right to ask for. I can only try to start to appreciate the amount of courage it can take for some of the women meeting older and\u00a0 more experienced men, and ask for what they want. And staying safe and emotionally undamaged at the same time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKudos to them, I will try to be less forgetful in the future.",

It's a lot to ask of anyone in general, but girls/women in the typical SB age-range, that's a hell of an ask. \n\nI will say it's great experience with transferable skills though. I do a lot better in professional environments dominated by old entitled white men due to my experiences in the bowl. ",
