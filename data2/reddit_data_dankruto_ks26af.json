A feat for his intelligence would be being the only known Uchiha to decipher the stone tablet, the only one to unlock the Rinnegan by tricking Hashirama-the steongest shinobi known to us (excluding the two kids that got all of their power handed on a silver plate). He was also able to keep himself alive and orchestrate the events that lead to Obito's manipulation (while Zetsu helped him it was still his own plan). Won't bother explaining more cause you're going to find another way to bash on him I've had the displeasure of having to interact with many Madara haters so I already know where this is going.

Talking about the whole plan and not the stone tablet thing. \nThe only thing Madara did not know (and had NO way of knowing as not even Jesus himself knew about Zetsu) is the Black Zetsu thing.\nI honestly don't know how you couldn't consider him a genius. Dude was able to trick Hashirama (not by biting him like a dog) but acting dead, knowing that Tobirama would keep his body and activating the Izanagi, cultivating Hashi's cells, creating Zetsu's (those Zetsus were obviously his creation despite Zetsu explaining their origin to be the Infinite Tsukuyomi it wouldn't make sense for Madara to not notice that they were coming out of nowhere, yes even despite the Zetsu twist). And while being crusty af he still managed to summon the statue, manipulate a whole ass village or whatever he did to those mist ninja, he even managed to seal the 3 tails inside of Rin while being some crusty ass 80 year old. Like come one who in the universe has done anything like that. While Zetsu has officially orchestrated the whole plan he was lucky enough to be immortal and retry his plan over and over (+ all he had to do was wait as manipulating the tablet and Indra was the only relevant part of his plan) most of his help came from being glued to Obito lol.\nSorry this got a lot longer than expected",

He also created Konoha together with Hashirama. \n\nWhen he was resurrected, he was immediately able to control and use Hashirama\u2019s senjutsu, and also use wood style. I think we\u2019ve all seen how difficult it is to master a new style and learn/control sage jutsu, but madara doesn\u2019t seem to have any issue in doing so, which means he\u2019s also a genius when it comes to ninjutsu. \n\nHis plan of using infinite tsukyomi wasn\u2019t a bad one either. Heck, for all we know, we could very well be living in a simulation but have no way to disprove it. Madara\u2019s tsukyomi would have just been a custom simulation for everyone where everyone gets to be happy. So a win-win.",

I've watched the world end at least 4 times in my nightmares, in one of them my own mother performed open heart surgery on me without anesthesia and when I woke up there was still this feeling of emptiness in my chest where my heart should be, and in another dream I had my head chopped off with an axe and I could physically feel the edge of the blade slicing through my skin and splintering the bones of my vertebrae. Sometimes I wake up feeling exhausted because it feels like I've lived the span of a lifetime in a single night. I bet I could live a dozen lifetimes in the Infinite Tsukiyomi until I died of exhaustion.",

No one saw the Zetsu twist coming and how was Madara supposed to see it coming when Zetsu literally came out of his crusty ass (we all know it was a bullshit plot device at the end to introduce Kaguya and extend the Naruto franchise in order to milk it). A feat for his intelligence would be being the only known Uchiha to decipher the stone tablet, the only one to unlock the Rinnegan by tricking Hashirama-the steongest shinobi known to us (excluding the two kids that got all of their power handed on a silver plate). He was also able to keep himself alive and orchestrate the events that lead to Obito's manipulation (while Zetsu helped him it was still his own plan). Won't bother explaining more cause you're going to find another way to bash on him I've had the displeasure of having to interact with many Madara haters so I already know where this is going. Also I'm curious about number 4, what nation did Madara run?",

Talking about the whole plan and not the stone tablet thing. \nThe only thing Madara did not know (and had NO way of knowing as not even Jesus himself knew about Zetsu) is the Black Zetsu thing.\nI honestly don't know how you couldn't consider him a genius. Dude was able to trick Hashirama (not by biting him like a dog) but acting dead, knowing that Tobirama would keep his body and activating the Izanagi, cultivating Hashi's cells, creating Zetsu's (those Zetsus were obviously his creation despite Zetsu explaining their origin to be the Infinite Tsukuyomi it wouldn't make sense for Madara to not notice that they were coming out of nowhere, yes even despite the Zetsu twist). And while being crusty af he still managed to summon the statue, manipulate a whole ass village or whatever he did to those mist ninja, he even managed to seal the 3 tails inside of Rin while being some crusty ass 80 year old. Like come one who in the universe has done anything like that. While Zetsu has officially orchestrated the whole plan he was lucky enough to be immortal and retry his plan over and over (+ all he had to do was wait as manipulating the tablet and Indra was the only relevant part of his plan) most of his help came from being glued to Obito lol.\nSorry this got a lot longer than expected",

He also created Konoha together with Hashirama. \n\nWhen he was resurrected, he was immediately able to control and use Hashirama\u2019s senjutsu, and also use wood style. I think we\u2019ve all seen how difficult it is to master a new style and learn/control sage jutsu, but madara doesn\u2019t seem to have any issue in doing so, which means he\u2019s also a genius when it comes to ninjutsu. \n\nHis plan of using infinite tsukyomi wasn\u2019t a bad one either. Heck, for all we know, we could very well be living in a simulation but have no way to disprove it.

For example, out of all the children being experimented with hashirama cells, only Yamato managed to not die, and even then, after years of practise his wood style was nowhere near Madara\u2019s level. And madara being able to control sage chakra has nothing to do with hashirama cells. Obviously naruto and Jiraya can use sage mode without hashirama cells. \n\nMadara\u2019s plan was literally born out of peace. He wanted everyone to lead a peaceful life. The argument here is whether living in a dream is true peace or not, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that madara wanted peace. \n\nHe didn\u2019t know that everyone dies after being captured by the tree.

I've watched the world end at least 4 times in my nightmares, in one of them my own mother performed open heart surgery on me without anesthesia and when I woke up there was still this feeling of emptiness in my chest where my heart should be, and in another dream I had my head chopped off with an axe and I could physically feel the edge of the blade slicing through my skin and splintering the bones of my vertebrae. Sometimes I wake up feeling exhausted because it feels like I've lived the span of a lifetime in a single night. I bet I could live a dozen lifetimes in the Infinite Tsukiyomi until I died of exhaustion.",

A feat for his intelligence would be being the only known Uchiha to decipher the stone tablet, the only one to unlock the Rinnegan by tricking Hashirama-the steongest shinobi known to us (excluding the two kids that got all of their power handed on a silver plate). He was also able to keep himself alive and orchestrate the events that lead to Obito's manipulation (while Zetsu helped him it was still his own plan). Won't bother explaining more cause you're going to find another way to bash on him I've had the displeasure of having to interact with many Madara haters so I already know where this is going. Also I'm curious about number 4, what nation did Madara run?",

Talking about the whole plan and not the stone tablet thing. \nThe only thing Madara did not know (and had NO way of knowing as not even Jesus himself knew about Zetsu) is the Black Zetsu thing.\nI honestly don't know how you couldn't consider him a genius. Dude was able to trick Hashirama (not by biting him like a dog) but acting dead, knowing that Tobirama would keep his body and activating the Izanagi, cultivating Hashi's cells, creating Zetsu's (those Zetsus were obviously his creation despite Zetsu explaining their origin to be the Infinite Tsukuyomi it wouldn't make sense for Madara to not notice that they were coming out of nowhere, yes even despite the Zetsu twist). And while being crusty af he still managed to summon the statue, manipulate a whole ass village or whatever he did to those mist ninja, he even managed to seal the 3 tails inside of Rin while being some crusty ass 80 year old. Like come one who in the universe has done anything like that. While Zetsu has officially orchestrated the whole plan he was lucky enough to be immortal and retry his plan over and over (+ all he had to do was wait as manipulating the tablet and Indra was the only relevant part of his plan) most of his help came from being glued to Obito lol.\nSorry this got a lot longer than expected",

He also created Konoha together with Hashirama. \n\nWhen he was resurrected, he was immediately able to control and use Hashirama\u2019s senjutsu, and also use wood style. I think we\u2019ve all seen how difficult it is to master a new style and learn/control sage jutsu, but madara doesn\u2019t seem to have any issue in doing so, which means he\u2019s also a genius when it comes to ninjutsu. \n\nHis plan of using infinite tsukyomi wasn\u2019t a bad one either. Heck, for all we know, we could very well be living in a simulation but have no way to disprove it. Madara\u2019s tsukyomi would have just been a custom simulation for everyone where everyone gets to be happy. So a win-win.",

Obviously naruto and Jiraya can use sage mode without hashirama cells. \n\nMadara\u2019s plan was literally born out of peace. He wanted everyone to lead a peaceful life.

Sometimes I wake up feeling exhausted because it feels like I've lived the span of a lifetime in a single night. I bet I could live a dozen lifetimes in the Infinite Tsukiyomi until I died of exhaustion.",

A feat for his intelligence would be being the only known Uchiha to decipher the stone tablet, the only one to unlock the Rinnegan by tricking Hashirama-the steongest shinobi known to us (excluding the two kids that got all of their power handed on a silver plate). He was also able to keep himself alive and orchestrate the events that lead to Obito's manipulation (while Zetsu helped him it was still his own plan). Won't bother explaining more cause you're going to find another way to bash on him I've had the displeasure of having to interact with many Madara haters so I already know where this is going.

Talking about the whole plan and not the stone tablet thing. \nThe only thing Madara did not know (and had NO way of knowing as not even Jesus himself knew about Zetsu) is the Black Zetsu thing.\nI honestly don't know how you couldn't consider him a genius. Dude was able to trick Hashirama (not by biting him like a dog) but acting dead, knowing that Tobirama would keep his body and activating the Izanagi, cultivating Hashi's cells, creating Zetsu's (those Zetsus were obviously his creation despite Zetsu explaining their origin to be the Infinite Tsukuyomi it wouldn't make sense for Madara to not notice that they were coming out of nowhere, yes even despite the Zetsu twist). And while being crusty af he still managed to summon the statue, manipulate a whole ass village or whatever he did to those mist ninja, he even managed to seal the 3 tails inside of Rin while being some crusty ass 80 year old. Like come one who in the universe has done anything like that. While Zetsu has officially orchestrated the whole plan he was lucky enough to be immortal and retry his plan over and over (+ all he had to do was wait as manipulating the tablet and Indra was the only relevant part of his plan) most of his help came from being glued to Obito lol.\nSorry this got a lot longer than expected",

He also created Konoha together with Hashirama. \n\nWhen he was resurrected, he was immediately able to control and use Hashirama\u2019s senjutsu, and also use wood style. I think we\u2019ve all seen how difficult it is to master a new style and learn/control sage jutsu, but madara doesn\u2019t seem to have any issue in doing so, which means he\u2019s also a genius when it comes to ninjutsu. \n\nHis plan of using infinite tsukyomi wasn\u2019t a bad one either. Heck, for all we know, we could very well be living in a simulation but have no way to disprove it. Madara\u2019s tsukyomi would have just been a custom simulation for everyone where everyone gets to be happy. So a win-win.",

And madara being able to control sage chakra has nothing to do with hashirama cells. Obviously naruto and Jiraya can use sage mode without hashirama cells. \n\nMadara\u2019s plan was literally born out of peace. He wanted everyone to lead a peaceful life. The argument here is whether living in a dream is true peace or not, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that madara wanted peace. \n\nHe didn\u2019t know that everyone dies after being captured by the tree.

A feat for his intelligence would be being the only known Uchiha to decipher the stone tablet, the only one to unlock the Rinnegan by tricking Hashirama-the steongest shinobi known to us (excluding the two kids that got all of their power handed on a silver plate). He was also able to keep himself alive and orchestrate the events that lead to Obito's manipulation (while Zetsu helped him it was still his own plan). Won't bother explaining more cause you're going to find another way to bash on him I've had the displeasure of having to interact with many Madara haters so I already know where this is going.

Talking about the whole plan and not the stone tablet thing. \nThe only thing Madara did not know (and had NO way of knowing as not even Jesus himself knew about Zetsu) is the Black Zetsu thing.\nI honestly don't know how you couldn't consider him a genius. Dude was able to trick Hashirama (not by biting him like a dog) but acting dead, knowing that Tobirama would keep his body and activating the Izanagi, cultivating Hashi's cells, creating Zetsu's (those Zetsus were obviously his creation despite Zetsu explaining their origin to be the Infinite Tsukuyomi it wouldn't make sense for Madara to not notice that they were coming out of nowhere, yes even despite the Zetsu twist). And while being crusty af he still managed to summon the statue, manipulate a whole ass village or whatever he did to those mist ninja, he even managed to seal the 3 tails inside of Rin while being some crusty ass 80 year old. Like come one who in the universe has done anything like that. While Zetsu has officially orchestrated the whole plan he was lucky enough to be immortal and retry his plan over and over (+ all he had to do was wait as manipulating the tablet and Indra was the only relevant part of his plan) most of his help came from being glued to Obito lol.\nSorry this got a lot longer than expected",

He also created Konoha together with Hashirama. \n\nWhen he was resurrected, he was immediately able to control and use Hashirama\u2019s senjutsu, and also use wood style. I think we\u2019ve all seen how difficult it is to master a new style and learn/control sage jutsu, but madara doesn\u2019t seem to have any issue in doing so, which means he\u2019s also a genius when it comes to ninjutsu. \n\nHis plan of using infinite tsukyomi wasn\u2019t a bad one either. Heck, for all we know, we could very well be living in a simulation but have no way to disprove it.

A feat for his intelligence would be being the only known Uchiha to decipher the stone tablet, the only one to unlock the Rinnegan by tricking Hashirama-the steongest shinobi known to us (excluding the two kids that got all of their power handed on a silver plate). He was also able to keep himself alive and orchestrate the events that lead to Obito's manipulation (while Zetsu helped him it was still his own plan). Won't bother explaining more cause you're going to find another way to bash on him I've had the displeasure of having to interact with many Madara haters so I already know where this is going.

Talking about the whole plan and not the stone tablet thing. \nThe only thing Madara did not know (and had NO way of knowing as not even Jesus himself knew about Zetsu) is the Black Zetsu thing.\nI honestly don't know how you couldn't consider him a genius. Dude was able to trick Hashirama (not by biting him like a dog) but acting dead, knowing that Tobirama would keep his body and activating the Izanagi, cultivating Hashi's cells, creating Zetsu's (those Zetsus were obviously his creation despite Zetsu explaining their origin to be the Infinite Tsukuyomi it wouldn't make sense for Madara to not notice that they were coming out of nowhere, yes even despite the Zetsu twist). And while being crusty af he still managed to summon the statue, manipulate a whole ass village or whatever he did to those mist ninja, he even managed to seal the 3 tails inside of Rin while being some crusty ass 80 year old. Like come one who in the universe has done anything like that. While Zetsu has officially orchestrated the whole plan he was lucky enough to be immortal and retry his plan over and over (+ all he had to do was wait as manipulating the tablet and Indra was the only relevant part of his plan) most of his help came from being glued to Obito lol.\nSorry this got a lot longer than expected",

He also created Konoha together with Hashirama. \n\nWhen he was resurrected, he was immediately able to control and use Hashirama\u2019s senjutsu, and also use wood style. I think we\u2019ve all seen how difficult it is to master a new style and learn/control sage jutsu, but madara doesn\u2019t seem to have any issue in doing so, which means he\u2019s also a genius when it comes to ninjutsu. \n\nHis plan of using infinite tsukyomi wasn\u2019t a bad one either. Heck, for all we know, we could very well be living in a simulation but have no way to disprove it. Madara\u2019s tsukyomi would have just been a custom simulation for everyone where everyone gets to be happy. So a win-win.",

He also created Konoha together with Hashirama. \n\nWhen he was resurrected, he was immediately able to control and use Hashirama\u2019s senjutsu, and also use wood style. I think we\u2019ve all seen how difficult it is to master a new style and learn/control sage jutsu, but madara doesn\u2019t seem to have any issue in doing so, which means he\u2019s also a genius when it comes to ninjutsu. \n\nHis plan of using infinite tsukyomi wasn\u2019t a bad one either. Heck, for all we know, we could very well be living in a simulation but have no way to disprove it. Madara\u2019s tsukyomi would have just been a custom simulation for everyone where everyone gets to be happy. So a win-win.",

Talking about the whole plan and not the stone tablet thing. \nThe only thing Madara did not know (and had NO way of knowing as not even Jesus himself knew about Zetsu) is the Black Zetsu thing.\nI honestly don't know how you couldn't consider him a genius. Dude was able to trick Hashirama (not by biting him like a dog) but acting dead, knowing that Tobirama would keep his body and activating the Izanagi, cultivating Hashi's cells, creating Zetsu's (those Zetsus were obviously his creation despite Zetsu explaining their origin to be the Infinite Tsukuyomi it wouldn't make sense for Madara to not notice that they were coming out of nowhere, yes even despite the Zetsu twist). And while being crusty af he still managed to summon the statue, manipulate a whole ass village or whatever he did to those mist ninja, he even managed to seal the 3 tails inside of Rin while being some crusty ass 80 year old. Like come one who in the universe has done anything like that. While Zetsu has officially orchestrated the whole plan he was lucky enough to be immortal and retry his plan over and over (+ all he had to do was wait as manipulating the tablet and Indra was the only relevant part of his plan) most of his help came from being glued to Obito lol.\nSorry this got a lot longer than expected",
