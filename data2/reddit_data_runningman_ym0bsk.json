            "body": "Just admiring these two. Both of them taking the subway and showing up to this channel (and KJK's) with no make-up in casual clothing really stood out to me. Both strong minded women who don't feel the need to show off who are also kind. Not to mention, it's so refreshing and empowering to see women especially in this industry go make-up free and show their honest beauties. There is nothing wrong with wearing make up. It's an art and it's nice to want to look better, too. But you have to love and respect yourself and not hide yourself behind makeup. This is important too, because so many girls (I was one of them) compare themselves to these celebrities who have an entire team of hair and make up and stylists and feel less than beautiful. So it's commandable and important for these celebs to show their true regular selves away from all the glamour.",

She would wake up with bed hair and puffy eyes, just rushing out to the opening for that competitive edge. \n\nBoth of them are actresses, which likely means they're not averse to zero make up since roles might call for it.",
