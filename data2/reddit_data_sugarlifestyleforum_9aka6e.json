    "body": "So I'm talking to someone and we start discussing gifts, reason why is not important. I say I'm avoiding material possessions that I don't need or truly love and don't want someone to waste their money on something I don't want (which is what happens a lot with SDs; I've thrown away a lot of \"gifts\" or just given them away).\n\nI tell this guy I'd love a gift card to a cooking class studio (I love food/cooking and prefer non-material gifts). He says its too much like cash so he doesn't like it. Ok fine, theres a pair of shoes I've wanted for work, thats really the only other thing I want thats in a reasonable price range that isn't a gift card.\n\nHe doesn't like that either and suggests instead nice chocolates we can share or lingerie I can model for him. \\*eyeroll\\*\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\nThis brings me to my point. **If the \"gift\" is about your enjoyment its not a gift for her its a gift for you.** I don't want a box of chocolates or lingerie (don't really eat sweets much and have enough lingerie for life thanks to these types of SDs).\n\n\u200b\n\nA gift isn't thoughtful if its about what YOU want and not what the person receiving wants.\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\nEdit: Apparently I am entitled and crazy for not wanting someone to waste money buying me something I don't want. This person asked me what I would want as a gift. I told him and he decided he would rather get me something he wants. It is not entitled to want to prevent people from wasting their money.\n\nThis sub is ridiculous and a lot of you are terrible gift givers. \n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b\n\n\u200b",

The same men complaining about SBs being cold and heartless and looking at everything as a business transaction are the ones who are saying if gifts weren\u2019t \u201cnegotiated\u201d into the original \u201cagreement\u201d then they have no say.  God forbid there be anything organic or fluid in a SR! If part of the arrangement includes a dynamic of gifting (unspoken or not) and doesn\u2019t specify 1 gift a week or a price point that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not still understood on both sides as a version of sugar! \n\nOP would probably be a lot less frustrated if her SD wasn\u2019t **specifically asking** what she would like as a gift.  But the whole... asking and then blatantly ignoring what she says is wrong and it\u2019s a control issue.  \n\nAnd for those who are harping on whether \u201cgifts\u201d are negotiated.. it doesn\u2019t matter!  With the power dynamic of an arrangement, most men like this still consider the gift \u201csugar\u201d (even if it\u2019s outside of regular allowance) and usually expect some sort of extra special treatment for the \u201cgift\u201d.  \n\nThis happens in the vanilla world as well.. example: boyfriend says he wants to take you on vacation as a birthday present.... you say the beach or somewhere warm because you don\u2019t like cold weather... your present ends up being his excuse to go skiing and god forbid you\u2019re not be happy about your \u201choliday\u201d... this mindset is so ass backwards I can\u2019t even deal with it. \n\nWhy ask someone what they want if it\u2019s just a song and dance for you to feel like what you\u2019re doing is actually for the other person?  It\u2019s one thing to be a clueless gifter it\u2019s another thing to play power games with someone ",

It really surprises me when SD's think that these things are really a gift for me, rather than for themselves.\n\nMy birthday is coming up and my SD asked me for my neck size. I know it's a gift but I *really* do not want a necklace I will never wear. So I tactfully redirected him towards a similar type of item - a watch - that I actually want and gave him 9-10 options. He didn't acknowledge that message. Knowing him, I have a feeling that he's going to go for the necklace anyway because he personally wants the romantic fantasy feeling of buying his partner a necklace and lovingly placing it around her neck etc. \n\nThis self-centred form of gift-giving is new to me and something I never experienced before the bowl. \n\nI know technically gifts are for the giver to give so maybe it wasn't right to redirect him to something I actually want but I would feel bad receiving a gift I know I'll never use. I'd rather get nothing, it's a complete waste of money.",

If you\u2019ve already decided what to get her, just get it for her and don\u2019t ask.  If you want to get her something you know she wants, ask and then get what is suggested. This is basic logic!

I simply said that people who aren't happy after receiving a gift (and what the OP is referring to is not a gift) are entitled. And let me add, it is my prerogative to feel that way.\n\nThat said, I didn't say that about SBs in general. Maybe you are generalizing just a little here?\n\nThe overwhelming response here is made up of SBs. I haven't been here long but it's clear that the SBs far outnumber the SDs.\n\nLook, no matter how you slice it, I won't start believing that the sky is green because everybody here says it is.\n\nHopefully my SB will appreciate my gifts.

It\u2019s degrading because instead of the \u201cgift\u201d being considerate, it\u2019s simply an act in his fantasy so that he can feel self-important. \n\nPlease reread this thread once you\u2019ve calmed down. The major issue in OP\u2019s interaction is that the SD asked (to come off as considerate and caring) and then completely went against what she suggested because it didn\u2019t fit into his fantasy (the opposite of considerate, inconsiderate).   If you\u2019ve already decided what to get her, just get it for her and don\u2019t ask.  If you want to get her something you know she wants, ask and then get what is suggested. This is basic logic!

It\u2019s degrading because instead of the \u201cgift\u201d being considerate, it\u2019s simply an act in his fantasy so that he can feel self-important. \n\nPlease reread this thread once you\u2019ve calmed down. The major issue in OP\u2019s interaction is that the SD asked (to come off as considerate and caring) and then completely went against what she suggested because it didn\u2019t fit into his fantasy (the opposite of considerate, inconsiderate).   If you\u2019ve already decided what to get her, just get it for her and don\u2019t ask.  If you want to get her something you know she wants, ask and then get what is suggested. This is basic logic!

It\u2019s degrading because instead of the \u201cgift\u201d being considerate, it\u2019s simply an act in his fantasy so that he can feel self-important. \n\nPlease reread this thread once you\u2019ve calmed down. The major issue in OP\u2019s interaction is that the SD asked (to come off as considerate and caring) and then completely went against what she suggested because it didn\u2019t fit into his fantasy (the opposite of considerate, inconsiderate).   If you\u2019ve already decided what to get her, just get it for her and don\u2019t ask.  If you want to get her something you know she wants, ask and then get what is suggested. This is basic logic!

It\u2019s degrading because instead of the \u201cgift\u201d being considerate, it\u2019s simply an act in his fantasy so that he can feel self-important. \n\nPlease reread this thread once you\u2019ve calmed down. The major issue in OP\u2019s interaction is that the SD asked (to come off as considerate and caring) and then completely went against what she suggested because it didn\u2019t fit into his fantasy (the opposite of considerate, inconsiderate).   If you\u2019ve already decided what to get her, just get it for her and don\u2019t ask.  If you want to get her something you know she wants, ask and then get what is suggested. This is basic logic!

I simply said that people who aren't happy after receiving a gift (and what the OP is referring to is not a gift) are entitled. And let me add, it is my prerogative to feel that way.\n\nThat said, I didn't say that about SBs in general. Maybe you are generalizing just a little here?\n\nThe overwhelming response here is made up of SBs. I haven't been here long but it's clear that the SBs far outnumber the SDs.\n\nLook, no matter how you slice it, I won't start believing that the sky is green because everybody here says it is.\n\nHopefully my SB will appreciate my gifts. If she doesn't then she will realize I'm not the right SD for her.",
