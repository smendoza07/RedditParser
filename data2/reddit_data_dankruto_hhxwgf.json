Now she is admittedly slightly better in Shippuden, she was actually a badass in the Gaara rescue arc but ultimately we see how little kishimoto cares about her as a character as even once she isnt useless for a bit she watches Naruto fight orochimaru gets tailwhipped and then cries, does nothing in the shikamaru arc and then cries for narutos help in the pain arc I think I might be noticing a bit of a pattern here, maybe it's just me. But after that she has one last chance to not be a shitty character when she goes after Sasuke alone I was just enraged what a fucking stupid bitch which male character is gonna save her Naruto or kakashi, I still held on to hope that she had some clever plan and would actually get close and not go out like a bitch but I guess she just had the wrong set of chromosomes, either way she got bitched for the five millionth time and this time because of her own recklessness, I know after this she became kage level but it was at the point that the power scaling increased so much it didn't matter and she was still useless, every time she has some introspective moment she just feels sorry for herself she never once attains what she wants it's just handed to her, she wants Sasuke back Naruto gets him back, and   as an added bonus she marries Sasuke, who literally tried to kill her, there is almost nothing redeeming or interesting about her character and literally every mha girl is more interesting than her, and mha has a similar issue, ochaco is a hundred times more likable than her and she actually put up a decent fight against her series's edgelord, tsu is cute and funny, Momo  is smart, and the girl with horns is likeable. Sakura is ok in boruto though, one of the only good things about the anime.",

I could easily say Guy had the potential to use Hashirama cells and then he'd easily beat Madara even with the 10 Tails. Or he had the potential to implant Sharingans like Kakashi or Danzo. Etc. The reality is simply that Madara with his natural born talent of Sharingan (and even Rinnegan) couldn't beat a fucking Taijutsu user without a monster with near-infinite chakra.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Naruto, sauske are literally chosen ones; \n\nEven in this case, Sasuke was more naturally talented than Naruto who overcame that gap through hard work.",

Now she is admittedly slightly better in Shippuden, she was actually a badass in the Gaara rescue arc but ultimately we see how little kishimoto cares about her as a character as even once she isnt useless for a bit she watches Naruto fight orochimaru gets tailwhipped and then cries, does nothing in the shikamaru arc and then cries for narutos help in the pain arc I think I might be noticing a bit of a pattern here, maybe it's just me. But after that she has one last chance to not be a shitty character when she goes after Sasuke alone I was just enraged what a fucking stupid bitch which male character is gonna save her Naruto or kakashi, I still held on to hope that she had some clever plan and would actually get close and not go out like a bitch but I guess she just had the wrong set of chromosomes, either way she got bitched for the five millionth time and this time because of her own recklessness, I know after this she became kage level but it was at the point that the power scaling increased so much it didn't matter and she was still useless, every time she has some introspective moment she just feels sorry for herself she never once attains what she wants it's just handed to her, she wants Sasuke back Naruto gets him back, and   as an added bonus she marries Sasuke, who literally tried to kill her, there is almost nothing redeeming or interesting about her character and literally every mha girl is more interesting than her, and mha has a similar issue, ochaco is a hundred times more likable than her and she actually put up a decent fight against her series's edgelord, tsu is cute and funny, Momo  is smart, and the girl with horns is likeable. Sakura is ok in boruto though, one of the only good things about the anime.",

If you really think that she's \"exactly\" the same from start to finish then idk if you've even watched the series. \n\n>And as I also pointed out- its pointless to argue with a person who refuses to take their fanboy goggles off.\n\nIt's also pointless to argue with someone who refuses to put away their hate boner",

                    "body": "I get it that Sakura bad memes are pretty crappy but are people going to get mad now if you don't say something positive about her, I mean she is like one of the worst female characters in all of anime and kind of a symbol of sexism in the og she is canonically useless to the point everyone knows she would just slow the boys down in the land of waves arc what does she do, stay back and watch the boys fight and then cry when Sasuke gets hurt, then she watches Sasuke fight Lee, then she is a liability to Sasuke while he fights orochimaru, then she is a liability to both of the boys while they fight Gaara, then Sasuke gets hurt and she cries and does jack shit, then Sasuke goes away and she cries and does jack shit. Now she is admittedly slightly better in Shippuden, she was actually a badass in the Gaara rescue arc but ultimately we see how little kishimoto cares about her as a character as even once she isnt useless for a bit she watches Naruto fight orochimaru gets tailwhipped and then cries, does nothing in the shikamaru arc and then cries for narutos help in the pain arc I think I might be noticing a bit of a pattern here, maybe it's just me. But after that she has one last chance to not be a shitty character when she goes after Sasuke alone I was just enraged what a fucking stupid bitch which male character is gonna save her Naruto or kakashi, I still held on to hope that she had some clever plan and would actually get close and not go out like a bitch but I guess she just had the wrong set of chromosomes, either way she got bitched for the five millionth time and this time because of her own recklessness, I know after this she became kage level but it was at the point that the power scaling increased so much it didn't matter and she was still useless, every time she has some introspective moment she just feels sorry for herself she never once attains what she wants it's just handed to her, she wants Sasuke back Naruto gets him back, and   as an added bonus she marries Sasuke, who literally tried to kill her, there is almost nothing redeeming or interesting about her character and literally every mha girl is more interesting than her, and mha has a similar issue, ochaco is a hundred times more likable than her and she actually put up a decent fight against her series's edgelord, tsu is cute and funny, Momo  is smart, and the girl with horns is likeable. Sakura is ok in boruto though, one of the only good things about the anime.",

He completely changed her to once again fit the narrative he was trying to push forward. \n\nI\u2019m not talking about \u201cdo they get stronger.\u201d This is a shonen manga, the entire point of it is to show characters getting stronger, but Kishimoto fails hard to combine the act of getting stronger with growing as a person when I comes to female roles. He either makes them accessories to the male characters or goals. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I enjoyed Naruto for what it was, but I\u2019m also able to critically analyze what I enjoy.",

            "body": "I get it that Sakura bad memes are pretty crappy but are people going to get mad now if you don't say something positive about her, I mean she is like one of the worst female characters in all of anime and kind of a symbol of sexism in the og she is canonically useless to the point everyone knows she would just slow the boys down in the land of waves arc what does she do, stay back and watch the boys fight and then cry when Sasuke gets hurt, then she watches Sasuke fight Lee, then she is a liability to Sasuke while he fights orochimaru, then she is a liability to both of the boys while they fight Gaara, then Sasuke gets hurt and she cries and does jack shit, then Sasuke goes away and she cries and does jack shit. Now she is admittedly slightly better in Shippuden, she was actually a badass in the Gaara rescue arc but ultimately we see how little kishimoto cares about her as a character as even once she isnt useless for a bit she watches Naruto fight orochimaru gets tailwhipped and then cries, does nothing in the shikamaru arc and then cries for narutos help in the pain arc I think I might be noticing a bit of a pattern here, maybe it's just me. But after that she has one last chance to not be a shitty character when she goes after Sasuke alone I was just enraged what a fucking stupid bitch which male character is gonna save her Naruto or kakashi, I still held on to hope that she had some clever plan and would actually get close and not go out like a bitch but I guess she just had the wrong set of chromosomes, either way she got bitched for the five millionth time and this time because of her own recklessness, I know after this she became kage level but it was at the point that the power scaling increased so much it didn't matter and she was still useless, every time she has some introspective moment she just feels sorry for herself she never once attains what she wants it's just handed to her, she wants Sasuke back Naruto gets him back, and   as an added bonus she marries Sasuke, who literally tried to kill her, there is almost nothing redeeming or interesting about her character and literally every mha girl is more interesting than her, and mha has a similar issue, ochaco is a hundred times more likable than her and she actually put up a decent fight against her series's edgelord, tsu is cute and funny, Momo  is smart, and the girl with horns is likeable. Sakura is ok in boruto though, one of the only good things about the anime.",

It's usually gradual, so idk what ur looking for. If you really think that she's \"exactly\" the same from start to finish then idk if you've even watched the series. \n\n>And as I also pointed out- its pointless to argue with a person who refuses to take their fanboy goggles off.\n\nIt's also pointless to argue with someone who refuses to put away their hate boner",

This does not equate to character progression as it\u2019s actually character *revision*. He completely changed her to once again fit the narrative he was trying to push forward. \n\nI\u2019m not talking about \u201cdo they get stronger.\u201d This is a shonen manga, the entire point of it is to show characters getting stronger, but Kishimoto fails hard to combine the act of getting stronger with growing as a person when I comes to female roles. He either makes them accessories to the male characters or goals. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I enjoyed Naruto for what it was, but I\u2019m also able to critically analyze what I enjoy.",

It's usually gradual, so idk what ur looking for. If you really think that she's \"exactly\" the same from start to finish then idk if you've even watched the series. \n\n>And as I also pointed out- its pointless to argue with a person who refuses to take their fanboy goggles off.\n\nIt's also pointless to argue with someone who refuses to put away their hate boner",

He either makes them accessories to the male characters or goals. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I enjoyed Naruto for what it was, but I\u2019m also able to critically analyze what I enjoy.",

If you really think that she's \"exactly\" the same from start to finish then idk if you've even watched the series. \n\n>And as I also pointed out- its pointless to argue with a person who refuses to take their fanboy goggles off.\n\nIt's also pointless to argue with someone who refuses to put away their hate boner",

It's usually gradual, so idk what ur looking for. If you really think that she's \"exactly\" the same from start to finish then idk if you've even watched the series. \n\n>And as I also pointed out- its pointless to argue with a person who refuses to take their fanboy goggles off.\n\nIt's also pointless to argue with someone who refuses to put away their hate boner",

Your argument that it's still a talent because Madara had the potential to use it is dumb. I could easily say Guy had the potential to use Hashirama cells and then he'd easily beat Madara even with the 10 Tails. Or he had the potential to implant Sharingans like Kakashi or Danzo. Etc. The reality is simply that Madara with his natural born talent of Sharingan (and even Rinnegan) couldn't beat a fucking Taijutsu user without a monster with near-infinite chakra.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Naruto, sauske are literally chosen ones; \n\nEven in this case, Sasuke was more naturally talented than Naruto who overcame that gap through hard work.",

The reality is simply that Madara with his natural born talent of Sharingan (and even Rinnegan) couldn't beat a fucking Taijutsu user without a monster with near-infinite chakra.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Naruto, sauske are literally chosen ones; \n\nEven in this case, Sasuke was more naturally talented than Naruto who overcame that gap through hard work.",

Also, in her novel, the first paragraph is her reflecting on how annoying she used to be which also demonstrates her growth. \n\n>She\u2019s also exactly the same from the start of the OG story to the end. The growth occurs off screen, as I\u2019ve already pointed out.\n\nIf she grew (even if off screen) then she's not exactly the same. Either way, growth doesn't happen instantly. It's usually gradual, so idk what ur looking for. If you really think that she's \"exactly\" the same from start to finish then idk if you've even watched the series. \n\n>And as I also pointed out- its pointless to argue with a person who refuses to take their fanboy goggles off.\n\nIt's also pointless to argue with someone who refuses to put away their hate boner",
