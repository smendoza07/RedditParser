Definitely don't use wax for this style. Wax is medium shine high hold and you don't want that. I think the guy uses Mousse as a prestyler when soaking then blow dries it backwards and then when it's about 70% dry he uses a bit of got2b matt paste. For the texture you can add some sea salt when soaking, but make sure you get one with no drying alcohols which you can check on curlsbot.com",

Wax is medium shine high hold and you don't want that. I think the guy uses Mousse as a prestyler when soaking then blow dries it backwards and then when it's about 70% dry he uses a bit of got2b matt paste. For the texture you can add some sea salt when soaking, but make sure you get one with no drying alcohols which you can check on curlsbot.com",
