    "body": "Date 1 last week, platonic meet and greet unpaid coffee. Talked for about 2 hours, great connection. Agreed on second date the following week, dinner and intimacy afterward. Talked specifically about having sex, condoms would be necessary, ppm amount, and that I'd send her test results I had just received a few days prior. \n\nDate 2, Wednesday, she was 45 mins late to dinner but gave me a heads up that she was running behind about 6 mins prior to date time. I was at the restaurant to grab us a table already, so, living nearby, I headed home in the meantime. Dinner convo wasn't terrible, but she was on her phone blatantly about 8 or 10 times over the course of the hour and 15 or so. \n\nWhen dinner was done I suggested we move on back to my place. She asked my address, which I gave her, then said she was texting it to her friend, but wouldn't be able to drive there as she had had her roomie drop her off. She would need to ride with me. \n\nMe, \"Ummm ok.. are you going to need a ride home? I don't really want your roomie coming to my house..\"\n\nHer, \"Yes please.\"\n\nSo we head to my place pleasantly chatting. Conversation continues until she drops in.\n\nHer, \"umm were you thinking we were going to have sex today? I was hoping we could cuddle on the couch and you could give me my allowance for the week. I want to work up to this having-sex thing.\" \n\nMe, \"Oh, I thought we had agreed we would start the arrangement this evening.\"\n\nHer, \"Yes, we have started the arrangement. I just don't want to have sex right away. It would make me feel like a prostitute.\"\n\nMe, \"I see, ok, well I'm happy to not have sex. I mean we can have as many platonic dates as you'd like in order to get to know each other and feel more comfortable.\"\n\nHer, \"Yeah maybe we can just cuddle on the couch or something and talk a bit before you give me my allowance and you take me home? I mean we havent even kissed yet, I'm definitely not going to just have sex with you\"\n\nMe, \"Uhh, no, I'm not going to pay an allowance for platonic dates.. initial platonic dates says to me that we haven't started the arrangement yet and so there wouldn't be an allowance.\"\n\nHer, \"It sounds like you are only valuing me for my body not my time.\"\n\nThings are getting more uncomfortable now, body language-wise.\n\nI objected, \"What happens if we get weeks or months into this and you don't ever feel like you want to have sex?\"\n\nHer, \"Well thats just the way it goes. If you are really sugaring then you are paying for my time, not my body. You just want a prostitute otherwise.\"\n\nMe, \"So if I'm getting this right, unless I pay you money and you decide what you feel comfortable doing or not doing, you aren't interested in an arrangement?\"\n\nHer, \"Yes, that's how sugar works.\"\n\nMe, \"I've been in the scene for a while, and that's not how this works. I'm not looking to be taken for a ride. Any time I've given money in the past, the girls have simply ghosted next, and while I don't think you'd do that... we seem to have a good connection... this isn't how this generally works. Puts the SDs in too vulnerable a position.\"\n\nHer, \"Well, have fun finding a prostitute then.\"\n\nI think she had forgotten that she hadn't driven. \n\nMe, \"Well, I don't want to do that. So, do you need me to drop you off somewhere?\"\n\nHer, \"Yeah, I don't want you knowing where I live, so just take me back to the restaurant and I'll have my roommate pick me up.\"\n\nLet me tell you, ladies and gentlemen. It was a frosty ride.",

If I were an SD, I wouldn't want to be paying a bunch of money for a nice dinner or whatever to then find out they suck like this girl does^^^^ I honestly hate the perspective that some women have on the site that they just get to get paid to go out to dinner/spend time whatever. Like no, the rest of us have had to put in work to make that money this is no easy life honey. I think the sugar life is glorified in media nowadays (thinking specifically female rappers). When people don't actually know what it takes. I wonder how young the girl was that OP went on a date with. If I had to guess she would be 18-20 w no experience on the site.",

            "body": ">If you are really sugaring then you are paying for my time,\n\nIronically, charging for time is exactly how escorting works.  If this is her model of sugar, then she's the one bringing that in... of course, none of these arguments (as per recent threads) is really about building a relationship oriented and mutually beneficial view of sugar relationships, it's about getting paid using any rhetorical argument necessary.  \"You're treating her like an escort\" and \"you should be able to afford it so you shouldn't care\" incoming.\n\nImagine when this is reversed.  SD says \"we are in a relationship so we have sex tonight... but I don't want to feel like I john so I'll start supporting you down the line at a time I decide, and it may never happen\".  Most of us would scream \"scammer!\" and we'd be right.  But even if we weren't right, what he's proposing isn't a sugar relationship, it's having sex and spending time with a hot girl.   Sugar relationships are relationships, but sex and allowance are understood.\n\nSo why, when an SB says exactly the same thing, \"we are in a relationship so you pay me every date, and we may or may not have sex down the line\", is it not EXACTLY THE SAME as the previous case?  Answer: it is exactly the same, and she's the equivalent of our hypothetical scammer/manipulator  in the previous paragraph, and he's almost as likely to be rinsed, as our previous SB was likely to get scammed..\n\nWhich is not to say that some more platonic dates where he spoils and pursues her aren't warranted, until such time as she's comfortable being in an SR, at which point, it's an SR, start giving allowance.",

I was very understanding and said I know just hoping into bed the first time can be awkward..so why don't I give you a massage and we can relax. She gets half naked lying on my bed as I'm massaging her back and shoulders...I complimented her on how soft and wholesome her skin was....then I gently kissed her upper back and she FREAKED!!..\"I can't do this, I can't do this\" she's yelling...She bolts from the bed to put her bra and blouse on and I calmly said, \"No problem, I'm sorry I'll take you wherever you want to go\"..She took a train to my place so I offered to drive her to the station, a friends house anywhere she wanted....Drove her to the station, with a pain  in my gut..thinking what kind of nut job did I get myself rapped up with...Dropped her off, with some money..An hour later comes the ranting text of what a creep I am, blah blah blah....\"Did you really expect me to have sex with you?\"...\"Um yea, what was that part of the discussion about condoms??..Did you think I would put them on my nose or something?\"....Thank God I never heard from her again.....",

The intent here is to manipulate a man who is not her SD (and who she is telling clearly, she is not ready for him to be her SD yet) that he somehow owes her guaranteed payment for her to get to know him more, otherwise he's \"treating her like an escort\", which of course makes him a john.  The escort shaming is unfortunate collateral damage in the pursuit of profit, but she's going to use the tools she has.  The intent is focused on exactly one thing: getting a man who is not her SD, and she doesn't (yet) want to be her SD, to feel obligated and shamed into paying her as if this were an actual SR at this point.  Declining to \"pay\" a random woman who is not his SB, is not \"treating her like an escort\" \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nTerms used when men do this to women include \"emotional manipulation\" and \"gaslighting\".  The proSB and rinserverse goes crazy when I properly and accurately apply their terms back to them, but the shoe is fitting very well.",

After she took a job overseas she would always ask to see me when she's in town (up until the pandemic anyway) I always kept it professional especially since at first there's no reason for me to think there was anything going on though we only started meeting out of office a few weeks before she left, all of which she initiated. On the last meet she her excuse was she wanted to run some business ideas through me. When we met, she was all quiet. I asked didn't she want to talk about her business ideas? She said \"No, we don't have to talk about that.\" and stayed on her phone.\n\nThis wasn't SA or anything, this was a real life, organic situation and she objectively spent a lot of time on lunch and dinners with me.\n\nThat last meet was our most awkward meet. I think she may be doing the young woman thing trying to \"test\" me or \"wait\" for me to make a move. I'm sorry, if you came to me with seeking advice as the stated reason, I'm going to give you my most professional and objective advice.\n\nI did console her over phone and text when she was starting out at that new job and struggling and feeling like she got stuck in a dead end career, so there's that. Maybe something changed along the way from genuinely seeking career advice to hoping for something more but she didn't know how to deal with it so she just awkwardly stared at her phone and not a word about her stated reason asking to see me.",

If I were an SD, I wouldn't want to be paying a bunch of money for a nice dinner or whatever to then find out they suck like this girl does^^^^ I honestly hate the perspective that some women have on the site that they just get to get paid to go out to dinner/spend time whatever. Like no, the rest of us have had to put in work to make that money this is no easy life honey. I think the sugar life is glorified in media nowadays (thinking specifically female rappers). When people don't actually know what it takes. I wonder how young the girl was that OP went on a date with. If I had to guess she would be 18-20 w no experience on the site.",

The 2 craziest posts I remember from a few months back 1) SB met up with a pot, he persuaded her to get into his car, then he robbed her at knifepoint. 2) SB was missing all her own cash AND the ppm after she got intimate in a hotel with her pot. She briefly left her purse unattended to use the bathroom before going home. She didn\u2019t realize he robbed her until she was halfway home and had to stop for gas. \n\nMen are not the only ones have to invest, or take losses. Lots of other women get shorted on the agreed amount, or get absolutely nothing after trusting their SD and giving him sex first.",

Meet somewhere public, vet accordingly, if you aren\u2019t comfortable go on public dates with no intimacy until you are, don\u2019t get in a car alone and don\u2019t go anywhere alone.\n\nThis is common sense.

Financial support (not payment, and definitely not payment for time) comes with an actual sugar relationship.  Ideally, it's something he *wants* to do for her, because he wants her happy (though admittedly, as the SR starts, this feeling needs time to build).  They are not, however, in an SR while she is still sorting out her comfort and feelings, which is that these types pretend to miss or don't care about (slf is relationship-forward;  but price-forward types ignore that there's no relationship or SR yet).  There's no basis for any allowance expectations whatsoever, while they're going on dates so she can decide whether he's the SD for her; he should, though, be doing the full court press to win her over, if he likes her.\n\nAnd there's no basis for these escort accusations when there's no SR. They're in an ongoing SR and he refuses support for platonic dates?  Different topic -- this time they're definitely IN an SR already.",

The intent here is to manipulate a man who is not her SD (and who she is telling clearly, she is not ready for him to be her SD yet) that he somehow owes her guaranteed payment for her to get to know him more, otherwise he's \"treating her like an escort\", which of course makes him a john.  The escort shaming is unfortunate collateral damage in the pursuit of profit, but she's going to use the tools she has.  The intent is focused on exactly one thing: getting a man who is not her SD, and she doesn't (yet) want to be her SD, to feel obligated and shamed into paying her as if this were an actual SR at this point.  Declining to \"pay\" a random woman who is not his SB, is not \"treating her like an escort\" \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nTerms used when men do this to women include \"emotional manipulation\" and \"gaslighting\".  The proSB and rinserverse goes crazy when I properly and accurately apply their terms back to them, but the shoe is fitting very well.",

She said \"No, we don't have to talk about that.\" and stayed on her phone.\n\nThis wasn't SA or anything, this was a real life, organic situation and she objectively spent a lot of time on lunch and dinners with me.\n\nThat last meet was our most awkward meet. I think she may be doing the young woman thing trying to \"test\" me or \"wait\" for me to make a move. I'm sorry, if you came to me with seeking advice as the stated reason, I'm going to give you my most professional and objective advice.\n\nI did console her over phone and text when she was starting out at that new job and struggling and feeling like she got stuck in a dead end career, so there's that. Maybe something changed along the way from genuinely seeking career advice to hoping for something more but she didn't know how to deal with it so she just awkwardly stared at her phone and not a word about her stated reason asking to see me.",

The 2 craziest posts I remember from a few months back 1) SB met up with a pot, he persuaded her to get into his car, then he robbed her at knifepoint. 2) SB was missing all her own cash AND the ppm after she got intimate in a hotel with her pot. She briefly left her purse unattended to use the bathroom before going home. She didn\u2019t realize he robbed her until she was halfway home and had to stop for gas. \n\nMen are not the only ones have to invest, or take losses. Lots of other women get shorted on the agreed amount, or get absolutely nothing after trusting their SD and giving him sex first.",

Like no, the rest of us have had to put in work to make that money this is no easy life honey. I think the sugar life is glorified in media nowadays (thinking specifically female rappers).
