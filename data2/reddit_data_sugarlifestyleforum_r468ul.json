    "body": "Just thought I would post a follow up to my post a few days ago about letting my sugar babies go through my late wife's clothes closet.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/qzd2tl/is\\_this\\_an\\_appropriate\\_gift\\_for\\_my\\_sugar\\_baby/](https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/qzd2tl/is_this_an_appropriate_gift_for_my_sugar_baby/)\n\nSo I had a big family reunion for Thanksgiving with my son, daughter, and three grandchildren coming from California and Europe to be here with me in my hometown.\n\nFirst I asked my daughter if she would be interested in looking at my wife's designer clothes. She said yes and picked out about half a dozen outfits.\n\nThen I made the same offer to my daughter in law.\n\nFinally I asked each of my sugar babies if they were interested and each of them picked out about six outfits. The response from everyone was overwhelming positive. I am so glad I did it. My late wife was the love of my life and we were married for over 30 years before she passed away four years ago. My wife was very stylish and I find that I enjoy seeing her signature clothes being worn by people I care about. It is almost like she is living on through them.\n\nThe entire experience was therapeutic and I feel like I have closed a chapter of my life by letting go of the past.\n\nThanks again for the good advice everyone gave me.",

Haven't been able to part with most of them.  I've been thinking of offering them to a SB friend but am afraid she'll be insulted I would offer to give her clothes previously worn by a woman now dead.  I'm hesitant to raise the subject at all, but perhaps now I will.  It's a great wardrobe.  If I get the vibe that it's OK to offer them to her it's intended on my part as a high compliment, plus they won't have to go waste, which would be a shame.",
