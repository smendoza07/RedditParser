I like to leave it a bit longer towards the temples. Switch to a number 3 and do the same, but don't come up as high, slowly fading the length as you go. Switch to a number 2 and tidy up the bottom on the sides and back. Be careful not to come up too high and be sure to curve the clippers away from the hair pretty aggressively as the number 2 can quickly fuck up your fade. I like to give around the ears and the low part of my temple/sideburns a quick buzz with the number 1, again fading really carefully. Take your time. \n\nLastly for the clippers, take off the guard and clean up the bottom around the back, this can be difficult without help, as watching through dual mirrors makes every move your hand makes feel backwards. \n\nOnce you've got the sides and back all done, dampen your hair with the spray bottle. Grab your comb and pick up some hair, starting at the back, and cut it to about 2 inches. Don't cut straight across the comb. Angle your scissors and cut small pieces at a time along the comb. This will give you some texture. Work your way towards the front doing the same, gradually increasing the length. \n\nAs for the temples and bangs, I kind of just pull them down and eyeball the length, cutting small pieces until I like the texture and length. This all takes practice and I suggest buying a hat before you try this for the first time. \n\nAfter you're satisfied, blow dry hair and tousled it around looking for stray long hairs or uneven pieces, tidying up as you go.
