It did take some time for my skin and hair to even out. I started when it was still cold out, so to avoid the awkward, \"Ew my hair is too greasy to be seen in public\" thing I just threw on a beanie and rolled with it. In hindsight, if your hair isn't super long you can cut it too to mitigate this problem.\n\nSo basically, I probably wash my hair with shampoo once every 7 to 10 days. I shower normally every day, and I thoroughly rinse my hair. I don't use conditioner but I guess that might be something to investigate. It really is just a matter of time and letting your skin adjust.",

It did take some time for my skin and hair to even out. I started when it was still cold out, so to avoid the awkward, \"Ew my hair is too greasy to be seen in public\" thing I just threw on a beanie and rolled with it. In hindsight, if your hair isn't super long you can cut it too to mitigate this problem.\n\nSo basically, I probably wash my hair with shampoo once every 7 to 10 days. I shower normally every day, and I thoroughly rinse my hair. I don't use conditioner but I guess that might be something to investigate. It really is just a matter of time and letting your skin adjust.",

I started when it was still cold out, so to avoid the awkward, \"Ew my hair is too greasy to be seen in public\" thing I just threw on a beanie and rolled with it. In hindsight, if your hair isn't super long you can cut it too to mitigate this problem.\n\nSo basically, I probably wash my hair with shampoo once every 7 to 10 days. I shower normally every day, and I thoroughly rinse my hair. I don't use conditioner but I guess that might be something to investigate. It really is just a matter of time and letting your skin adjust.",
