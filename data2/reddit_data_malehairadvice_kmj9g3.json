I used to wear Tripp pants with a Large Men's graphic tee shirt tucked into a studded belt so I could show off the Heartagram buckle. And I had a chin beard. It's all a good and valuable journey. Cheers on your solid hair cut though, and on feeling good about the style you're rocking these days. Try to find a way to be confident wherever your hair and your fashion sense takes you next. So much of \"looking good\" is just confidence and healthy self-affection.",
