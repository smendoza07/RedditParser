    "body": "ETA: Have received 3 angry DMs from 3 different people telling me I\u2019m a prostitute.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nI have been with my very generous SD for 1.5 years now. \n\nThe first few months were spent getting to know each other and developing a friendship, with no allowance and no intimacy. It was something that just kind of blossomed naturally after we met through mutual friends. During the course of this period of getting to know each other he told me that he has some longterm girlfriends that he supports financially. At this point I was clueless about SRs, but I obviously now know that they are his SBs. \n\nAnyway, as our friendship developed he began buying me expensive gifts and it was usually things that I had no use (or space!) for. We were not yet intimate at this point, but it was beyond the friendship stage. We had expressed feelings for each other. I was always extremely grateful, but always found a polite way to tell him that I felt he was wasting his money as I wouldn\u2019t use the things, and perhaps he could give them to his girlfriends. I would also always tell him that he didn\u2019t need to \u201cbuy\u201d my affection with gifts, and that I wanted to spend time with him willingly. He would insist that I kept the gifts, so I did. It was stuff like bags, shoes, clothes, things for my apartment, things for my hobbies, jewellery, electronics etc. \n\nAfter a few weeks of this, he did something amazing. We had spoken numerous times at length about my financial situation (which was dire) purely because I wanted his advice on a few things. After one of our dates at a restaurant, as I was leaving he said be careful with the bag (he had bought me a bag). I told him not to worry and that I wouldn\u2019t lose it. When I got home I found an envelope with a huge wad of cash inside it. I genuinely couldn\u2019t believe it. Keep in mind at this point I had NO CLUE about SRs or anything to do with SRs. I didn\u2019t know that this was something that people did. I still remember how I felt as I looked at the massive amount of cash and thought about how ridiculously generous this man was. I remember counting it and not actually believing what I was seeing, it was enough to cover my monthly rent on my apartment. I called him and he said he did it because I\u2019d probably find the cash more useful than the gifts, but that he still wanted to buy me things as he enjoyed it. I told him it was way too much and that I hadn\u2019t done anything to deserve it (cringe). Note - we had still not yet had sex at this point but we had kissed. He insisted that I kept it, I kept refusing. The next time we met, I took it with me to give back to him. I don\u2019t know why I did this as I actually really needed the money \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f He would not take it back. And at the end of that date he gave me another envelope.\n\nAll of our dates so far had been in public places. He asked me if for our next date I\u2019d like to spend some time with him in a hotel, and that I could pick any hotel in our city. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to pick as it would have felt entitled, but I did want to take things further, so I asked him to decide. Ok so....I was NOT prepared for where he would take me. It was one of the fanciest hotels in our city. Somewhere where I would have been scared to ever set foot in because I\u2019d have felt so out of place and not known how to act. I remember feeling like I had stepped into another world. I couldn\u2019t believe it. The suite was maybe 3 times the size of my apartment. The bed was bigger than my entire bedroom. We had the most incredible time. He was so gentle to start. So patient and just spent so long on foreplay. It was beyond amazing. I have never in my entire life known anything like it. That night I went home and I started reading into things, I was looking up things like \u201cwhat are older men interested in\u201d \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd74 mainly because I wanted to keep things going with him as it was so enjoyable. So I found out about SRs. Obviously I had heard the term sugar daddy before but I didn\u2019t properly understand. So many feelings as I was asking myself \u201cam I a sugar baby??\u201d and then the panic of thinking I wasn\u2019t good enough or savvy enough. I decided to just let things continue as the were without worrying too much about labels.\n\nWe continued to meet up like this and each time he would take me to a different, amazing hotel after whatever date or activity. Then lockdown happened. By this stage we had switched from cash to bank transfers and I was (and am!) still so shocked/grateful/ecstatic every time I get a transfer. I told him that since we couldn\u2019t meet up during lockdown, he should stop sending me money. He said that he was NOT sending me money for sex, but that it was because he wanted to help me. I said that I knew it wasn\u2019t for sex, but it still didn\u2019t feel fair that he was doing something for me when I couldn\u2019t really do anything for him. He went ahead and sent over the usual amount of money the first month of lockdown - I immediately sent it back to him. We had a long chat and he told me that he would continue to send me the money so it was a waste of time me sending it back. And he kept his word and sent over the same amount for every month that we were in lockdown. Not even a reduced amount - the FULL AMOUNT \ud83d\ude2b\n\nANYWAY. We are back to meeting in person now and I recently had a discussion with him about all of this and asked why he continued to send me money each month. I wanted to share his answer with you all. The gist of it is that he felt his help was making a difference to my life, and also because I have never expected or demanded it of him (turns out his other SBs had been hassling him about what would happen re \u201callowance\u201d over lockdown). Also he mentioned that I have always been so genuinely grateful for his help. He is now talking about buying me a car and paying for driving lessons \ud83d\ude2d\n\nI don\u2019t know, I just wanted to share this little love story of mine haha. Maybe it will give people hope!",
