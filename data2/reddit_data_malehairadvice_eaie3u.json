I have been using ID grey lid hairwax or Osis Dust it hairpowder, which makes your texture go all matt and sticky. seeing from where that picture is from, that was most likely what I was using) \nWith the product I many just focus on not getting it too high and separating it from the sides. I like to try and get a little overhang like Tim the picture but that\u2019s mostly just from wind blowing. \n\nCheers",

I have been using ID grey lid hairwax or Osis Dust it hairpowder, which makes your texture go all matt and sticky. seeing from where that picture is from, that was most likely what I was using) \nWith the product I many just focus on not getting it too high and separating it from the sides. I like to try and get a little overhang like Tim the picture but that\u2019s mostly just from wind blowing. \n\nCheers",
