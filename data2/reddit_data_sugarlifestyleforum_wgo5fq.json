    "body": "It has been a month (she joined me for Fourth of July fireworks), and I missed her like crazy. She comes over, and shows me the draft work she has accomplished on her project. This is a major production in my opinion (music and video composition), and she's a natural creative director.  Holy cow, in those four weeks she completely astounded me with her accomplishments in that time, I spent the evening legitimately stunned and awed. This absolute dynamo is sharing some of her most personal works with me...\n\nShe is now snoring (gently) on the couch, I'm gonna make sure her morning is one to remember.  To you awesome SBs out there, I hope you find the romance, fun, and support (financial, physical, emotional, spiritual) of your dreams.",
