Guy was undoubtedly a positive influence on Kakashi's life but even Kakashi admits that it was Team 7 that really got him out of his depression because he felt like he had a purpose in life again. Guy was a great friend but Kakashi needed a lot more to fill the hole in his heart.\n\nIt's a bit sad because Guy really did try his best but I don't think it was until Shippuden that Kakashi start to really appreciate having Guy as a friend. Even compared to Part 1 Kakashi seems a lot more fine with fooling around with Guy in Shippuden.",

Guy was undoubtedly a positive influence on Kakashi's life but even Kakashi admits that it was Team 7 that really got him out of his depression because he felt like he had a purpose in life again. Guy was a great friend but Kakashi needed a lot more to fill the hole in his heart.\n\nIt's a bit sad because Guy really did try his best but I don't think it was until Shippuden that Kakashi start to really appreciate having Guy as a friend. Even compared to Part 1 Kakashi seems a lot more fine with fooling around with Guy in Shippuden.",
