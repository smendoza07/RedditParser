    "body": "I started sugaring in July and met my current SD after only about three weeks of being in the bowl. Hit it off immediately, we get along really well and his preferences in bed mesh really well with mine. The first month of seeing each other he was adamant that we stay strictly platonic to make sure we got along as people before introducing sex into the equation. I got really lucky. \n\nWell... yesterday he bought me a car. I\u2019m a single mom and I hadn\u2019t had my own car since I totaled my lease in 2017 and destroyed my credit. I don\u2019t even want to think about how much I\u2019ve spent on LYFT over the years... but guys, holy crap. This is the most impactful and precious gift anyone could have ever given me. We got the car yesterday and today I was able to take my son to a children\u2019s museum for the first time, on my own, and go out for lunch afterwards without it costing me an arm and a leg and having to lug a 15lb car seat every step of the way. \n\nIt\u2019s not a perfect car, but it\u2019s 100% mine and I\u2019m so fucking thankful. I\u2019m so thankful for this forum pushing me to take the plunge and actually get into sugaring. I\u2019m so thankful for everything. \n\nThat brings me to my question, fellow SBs, what is the best/most precious gift your SD has given to you? I\u2019d love to hear y\u2019alls stories. \u2764\ufe0f",

She did not come from a very wealthy family and she was the first in her family to graduate from college so she didn\u2019t really have the right guidance to navigate higher education and funding etc. All she knew was that she wanted to be a pediatric oncologist and she worked so fucking hard for it that I could not stand by and let the reality and obscene cost of higher education sit between her and her dream. \n\nShe was my significant other for three years and we were definitely trending towards marriage. I didn\u2019t necessarily support her except for the usual dates and activities, gifts during birthdays and holidays. I did add her as an AU on my credit card. She used it once in three years when her debit card was locked because it was part of a data breach. She is incredibly humble and the single most deserving person I have ever known. \n\nI still think it\u2019s criminal how our alma mater did not give her any financial assistance and I refuse to participate in alumni events and donations because of that.",

A week at the Phoenician spa in Scottsdale. I had fabulous massages, treatments, went horse back riding and hiking on the trails and swam. Shopping trips in Montreal. Ski weekends in Vermont.

Or, your SD generously supported your favorite community organization.\n\nI agree with you that the best gifts aren't quantifiable.  What a great dialogue for a M&G.

Granted, she doesn't have a DL and I told her that I would be pissed if she sold it but I thought it might motivate her to get her DL and stop spending money on Uber. Smfh\n\nNow I think she is seeing another SD... We are supposed to see each other tonight but I'm not holding my breath. I modified our arrangement some after the last 2 no shows to about half of the allowance up front at the beginning of the month and a generous ppm.\n\nWhen we do see each other, she is enthusiastic and tells me all the right stuff... But actions are louder than words.\n\nEDIT: This is not the first time I gifted a car. I have another SB that I helped buy a car with a large down payment and I have been paying the payment and insurance every month since.",

There were really long nights, even longer when I had to use a shared computer w the program that was outdated, CHAINED TO THE WALL, and slow as hell. For christmas he let me pick out a laptop... it's more expensive than my car and does ALL the things I need it to do. 2 years later he is no longer in my life but i still swell with gratitude every time I use it. And very recently a FWB (who i met on a regular dating app, thinking he was an SD) deciding to make me on a shopping spree. He has quit his job and is traveling the country and drove out to see ME to take me shopping. Ive never really had an SD do that... i've always sugared for rent money. I told him that i couldnt really focus on wants because I had needs. He set me up with a new phone (min was quite literally falling apart), 2 year insurance on it, the best case, even a glass screen protector with a lifetime warranty? I didnt know that was a thing. Apparently whenever it cracks, even if it's my own damn fault, i take it to bestbuy and they install a new one on the spot for free. It is such a relief to know I won't need to stress about any phone expenses for 2 years. It had become a major point of stress in my life trying to replace while I was not sugaring. And after that he took me shopping \ud83d\ude01 I've never felt more cared for.",

I didn\u2019t necessarily support her except for the usual dates and activities, gifts during birthdays and holidays. I did add her as an AU on my credit card. She used it once in three years when her debit card was locked because it was part of a data breach.

Or, your SD generously supported your favorite community organization.\n\nI agree with you that the best gifts aren't quantifiable.  What a great dialogue for a M&G.  Sadly, so many SBs are seduced by the material benefits in the sugar world, and not the wonderful treatment they can get from wise and mature gentlemen suitors.",

She did not come from a very wealthy family and she was the first in her family to graduate from college so she didn\u2019t really have the right guidance to navigate higher education and funding etc. All she knew was that she wanted to be a pediatric oncologist and she worked so fucking hard for it that I could not stand by and let the reality and obscene cost of higher education sit between her and her dream. \n\nShe was my significant other for three years and we were definitely trending towards marriage. I didn\u2019t necessarily support her except for the usual dates and activities, gifts during birthdays and holidays. I did add her as an AU on my credit card. She used it once in three years when her debit card was locked because it was part of a data breach. She is incredibly humble and the single most deserving person I have ever known. \n\nI still think it\u2019s criminal how our alma mater did not give her any financial assistance and I refuse to participate in alumni events and donations because of that.",

She did not come from a very wealthy family and she was the first in her family to graduate from college so she didn\u2019t really have the right guidance to navigate higher education and funding etc. All she knew was that she wanted to be a pediatric oncologist and she worked so fucking hard for it that I could not stand by and let the reality and obscene cost of higher education sit between her and her dream. \n\nShe was my significant other for three years and we were definitely trending towards marriage. I didn\u2019t necessarily support her except for the usual dates and activities, gifts during birthdays and holidays. I did add her as an AU on my credit card. She used it once in three years when her debit card was locked because it was part of a data breach.
