It's true that no amount of grit and hard work will allow an average shinobi to compete with the likes of Madara, Hashirama, Naruto, or Sasuke. \n\n\nBut Neji wasn't looking at those peaks of power when he made his argument; he was just upset because he and his father were expected from birth to serve the main branch of the Hyuga family. Neji was never permanently stuck in this position, not truly. \n\nIf he wanted, Neji could have arranged the assassination of the members of the main Hyuga branch. He might have needed time to plan, prepare, or arrange the incident; but he could have done it. The Akatsuki would have probably taken the job and probably could have succeeded. The other Hidden Villages would have probably helped him if he agreed to give up one or more of his Byakugan as payment (assuming they found a way to defeat the seal on his eyes). Ultimately, Neji was trapped by his own defeatism rather than any real impossibility of changing his situation.\n\nThough, of course, Naruto's counterargument to Neji was malarkey. Naruto put all his eggs in the \"you can become strong if you try\" basket, but Naruto only beat Neji because of Kurama's strength, something Naruto didn't have to earn on his own.",

People forget that Naruto had been working hard to practice the clone technique for a long time prior to him jumping to a thousand shadow clones. But when Iruka displayed confidence in Naruto all of a sudden found it within himself to make a thousand shadow clones when before he couldn't even do a single regular clone.\n\nThat was what Naruto was telling Neji. To stop bemoaning an alleged fate and have the confidence to make your own path even calling him a genius unlike him (Naruto). And that sticks with Neji to the point that it's something he says before he finishes off Kidomaru.",

Could Naruto have accomplished any of his goals without kickass genetics and personal connections to important people? No. \n\nNaruto forcing Kurama's power out in the Neji fight doesn't change the fact that it's not his own power. And it's not like this is something Naruto does consciously anyway, the power shows up pre-Shippuden whenever Naruto gets emotionally charged while backed into a corner. It showed up against Orochimaru's snake in the forest, against Haku in the Zabuza fight, and against Neji in the tournament. \n\nAs for what being the son of the 4th and Kushina got him: \n\nNaruto inherited the Uzamaki stamina and ability to heal from wounds really quickly. He also had naturally deep chakra reserves even without Kurama. This allowed him to make tons of shadow clones, almost guaranteeing more efficient training once someone showed him the clone trick.\n\nNaruto got personal tutelage from Jiriya because of the connection between Jiriya and the 4th, though Naruto didn't know it at the time. Jiriya taught Naruto basic chakra control, the summoning jutsu, and the rasengan.\n\nBecause of Jiriya, Naruto also formed a connection with the Toad Sages. This led to Naruto getting the opportunity to learn Senjutsu. Yes Naruto worked really hard to master Sage Mode, but few Shinobi ever get the chance to attempt it. And Naruto benefitted from Jiriya's longtime friend/teacher dedicating himself to Naruto's sage training after Jiriya died. \n\nBecause of Jiriya, Naruto also developed a personal relationship with Pain during their fight. This connection allowed Naruto the opportunity to negotiate with Nagato, which allowed for the resurrection of the dead Leaf Shinobi. Was this also the result of Naruto's choices? Yes. Could anyone else have pulled this off? Almost certainly not. Nagato only cared about Naruto's philosophy because they had the same teacher.\n\nNaruto also benefitted from Kakashi, who was assigned to team 7 partly because of the connection Kakashi shared with both Naruto and Sasuke. Kakashi, though not until mid Shippuden, taught Naruto how to harness shadow clones for training. Kakashi also leveraged his own connections to recruit Yamato for the sole purpose of sitting still all day to assist Naruto with training by suppressing Kurama's chakra. \n\nAnd being an Ashura incarnate led directly to Naruto receiving the Six Paths abilities which: amplified Naruto's healing abilities to the point he could regenerate even other people's body parts, greatly improved his stamina and strength, gave him truth seeking orbs, and let him naturally fly.",

I'm not even sure if the Leaf and Sand would have been great allies either without the Akatsuki.   Sure Naruto and Gaara were on good terms, but both nations seemed to just tolerate the other at that point.\n\nThe threat of a mutually assured destruction seems a lot more plausible to me than anything else in the shinobi world in regards to peace.  The only reason there was peace at the end was because there was a world ending threat that forced the great nations to work together and a lot of strong bonds were forged.  Without that threat, I really don't know if peace would have been possible in the story.\n\nSure Pain's plan may have been dumping water on a grease fire, and as dumb as it was, do you think there could have been a better plan?  Especially since most of the great nations hated each other due to past skirmishes/wars.  \n\nIt's all interesting to think about though.  Idk it just seems like no one would have come up with an answer for peace without the 4th great ninja war happening. Sorry for rambling haha.",

It's true that no amount of grit and hard work will allow an average shinobi to compete with the likes of Madara, Hashirama, Naruto, or Sasuke. \n\n\nBut Neji wasn't looking at those peaks of power when he made his argument; he was just upset because he and his father were expected from birth to serve the main branch of the Hyuga family. Neji was never permanently stuck in this position, not truly. \n\nIf he wanted, Neji could have arranged the assassination of the members of the main Hyuga branch. He might have needed time to plan, prepare, or arrange the incident; but he could have done it. The Akatsuki would have probably taken the job and probably could have succeeded. The other Hidden Villages would have probably helped him if he agreed to give up one or more of his Byakugan as payment (assuming they found a way to defeat the seal on his eyes). Ultimately, Neji was trapped by his own defeatism rather than any real impossibility of changing his situation.\n\nThough, of course, Naruto's counterargument to Neji was malarkey. Naruto put all his eggs in the \"you can become strong if you try\" basket, but Naruto only beat Neji because of Kurama's strength, something Naruto didn't have to earn on his own.",

People forget that Naruto had been working hard to practice the clone technique for a long time prior to him jumping to a thousand shadow clones. But when Iruka displayed confidence in Naruto all of a sudden found it within himself to make a thousand shadow clones when before he couldn't even do a single regular clone.\n\nThat was what Naruto was telling Neji. To stop bemoaning an alleged fate and have the confidence to make your own path even calling him a genius unlike him (Naruto).

No. \n\nNaruto forcing Kurama's power out in the Neji fight doesn't change the fact that it's not his own power. And it's not like this is something Naruto does consciously anyway, the power shows up pre-Shippuden whenever Naruto gets emotionally charged while backed into a corner. It showed up against Orochimaru's snake in the forest, against Haku in the Zabuza fight, and against Neji in the tournament. \n\nAs for what being the son of the 4th and Kushina got him: \n\nNaruto inherited the Uzamaki stamina and ability to heal from wounds really quickly. He also had naturally deep chakra reserves even without Kurama. This allowed him to make tons of shadow clones, almost guaranteeing more efficient training once someone showed him the clone trick.\n\nNaruto got personal tutelage from Jiriya because of the connection between Jiriya and the 4th, though Naruto didn't know it at the time. Jiriya taught Naruto basic chakra control, the summoning jutsu, and the rasengan.\n\nBecause of Jiriya, Naruto also formed a connection with the Toad Sages. This led to Naruto getting the opportunity to learn Senjutsu. Yes Naruto worked really hard to master Sage Mode, but few Shinobi ever get the chance to attempt it. And Naruto benefitted from Jiriya's longtime friend/teacher dedicating himself to Naruto's sage training after Jiriya died. \n\nBecause of Jiriya, Naruto also developed a personal relationship with Pain during their fight. This connection allowed Naruto the opportunity to negotiate with Nagato, which allowed for the resurrection of the dead Leaf Shinobi. Was this also the result of Naruto's choices? Yes. Could anyone else have pulled this off? Almost certainly not. Nagato only cared about Naruto's philosophy because they had the same teacher.\n\nNaruto also benefitted from Kakashi, who was assigned to team 7 partly because of the connection Kakashi shared with both Naruto and Sasuke. Kakashi, though not until mid Shippuden, taught Naruto how to harness shadow clones for training. Kakashi also leveraged his own connections to recruit Yamato for the sole purpose of sitting still all day to assist Naruto with training by suppressing Kurama's chakra. \n\nAnd being an Ashura incarnate led directly to Naruto receiving the Six Paths abilities which: amplified Naruto's healing abilities to the point he could regenerate even other people's body parts, greatly improved his stamina and strength, gave him truth seeking orbs, and let him naturally fly.",

I'm not even sure if the Leaf and Sand would have been great allies either without the Akatsuki.   Sure Naruto and Gaara were on good terms, but both nations seemed to just tolerate the other at that point.\n\nThe threat of a mutually assured destruction seems a lot more plausible to me than anything else in the shinobi world in regards to peace.  The only reason there was peace at the end was because there was a world ending threat that forced the great nations to work together and a lot of strong bonds were forged.  Without that threat, I really don't know if peace would have been possible in the story.\n\nSure Pain's plan may have been dumping water on a grease fire, and as dumb as it was, do you think there could have been a better plan?  Especially since most of the great nations hated each other due to past skirmishes/wars.  \n\nIt's all interesting to think about though.  Idk it just seems like no one would have come up with an answer for peace without the 4th great ninja war happening. Sorry for rambling haha.",

But when Iruka displayed confidence in Naruto all of a sudden found it within himself to make a thousand shadow clones when before he couldn't even do a single regular clone.\n\nThat was what Naruto was telling Neji. To stop bemoaning an alleged fate and have the confidence to make your own path even calling him a genius unlike him (Naruto).

No. \n\nNaruto forcing Kurama's power out in the Neji fight doesn't change the fact that it's not his own power. And it's not like this is something Naruto does consciously anyway, the power shows up pre-Shippuden whenever Naruto gets emotionally charged while backed into a corner. It showed up against Orochimaru's snake in the forest, against Haku in the Zabuza fight, and against Neji in the tournament. \n\nAs for what being the son of the 4th and Kushina got him: \n\nNaruto inherited the Uzamaki stamina and ability to heal from wounds really quickly. He also had naturally deep chakra reserves even without Kurama. This allowed him to make tons of shadow clones, almost guaranteeing more efficient training once someone showed him the clone trick.\n\nNaruto got personal tutelage from Jiriya because of the connection between Jiriya and the 4th, though Naruto didn't know it at the time. Jiriya taught Naruto basic chakra control, the summoning jutsu, and the rasengan.\n\nBecause of Jiriya, Naruto also formed a connection with the Toad Sages. This led to Naruto getting the opportunity to learn Senjutsu. Yes Naruto worked really hard to master Sage Mode, but few Shinobi ever get the chance to attempt it. And Naruto benefitted from Jiriya's longtime friend/teacher dedicating himself to Naruto's sage training after Jiriya died. \n\nBecause of Jiriya, Naruto also developed a personal relationship with Pain during their fight. This connection allowed Naruto the opportunity to negotiate with Nagato, which allowed for the resurrection of the dead Leaf Shinobi. Was this also the result of Naruto's choices? Yes. Could anyone else have pulled this off? Almost certainly not. Nagato only cared about Naruto's philosophy because they had the same teacher.\n\nNaruto also benefitted from Kakashi, who was assigned to team 7 partly because of the connection Kakashi shared with both Naruto and Sasuke. Kakashi, though not until mid Shippuden, taught Naruto how to harness shadow clones for training. Kakashi also leveraged his own connections to recruit Yamato for the sole purpose of sitting still all day to assist Naruto with training by suppressing Kurama's chakra. \n\nAnd being an Ashura incarnate led directly to Naruto receiving the Six Paths abilities which: amplified Naruto's healing abilities to the point he could regenerate even other people's body parts, greatly improved his stamina and strength, gave him truth seeking orbs, and let him naturally fly.",

I'm not even sure if the Leaf and Sand would have been great allies either without the Akatsuki.   Sure Naruto and Gaara were on good terms, but both nations seemed to just tolerate the other at that point.\n\nThe threat of a mutually assured destruction seems a lot more plausible to me than anything else in the shinobi world in regards to peace.  The only reason there was peace at the end was because there was a world ending threat that forced the great nations to work together and a lot of strong bonds were forged.  Without that threat, I really don't know if peace would have been possible in the story.\n\nSure Pain's plan may have been dumping water on a grease fire, and as dumb as it was, do you think there could have been a better plan?  Especially since most of the great nations hated each other due to past skirmishes/wars.  \n\nIt's all interesting to think about though.  Idk it just seems like no one would have come up with an answer for peace without the 4th great ninja war happening. Sorry for rambling haha.",

But when Iruka displayed confidence in Naruto all of a sudden found it within himself to make a thousand shadow clones when before he couldn't even do a single regular clone.\n\nThat was what Naruto was telling Neji. To stop bemoaning an alleged fate and have the confidence to make your own path even calling him a genius unlike him (Naruto).

No. \n\nNaruto forcing Kurama's power out in the Neji fight doesn't change the fact that it's not his own power. And it's not like this is something Naruto does consciously anyway, the power shows up pre-Shippuden whenever Naruto gets emotionally charged while backed into a corner. It showed up against Orochimaru's snake in the forest, against Haku in the Zabuza fight, and against Neji in the tournament. \n\nAs for what being the son of the 4th and Kushina got him: \n\nNaruto inherited the Uzamaki stamina and ability to heal from wounds really quickly. He also had naturally deep chakra reserves even without Kurama. This allowed him to make tons of shadow clones, almost guaranteeing more efficient training once someone showed him the clone trick.\n\nNaruto got personal tutelage from Jiriya because of the connection between Jiriya and the 4th, though Naruto didn't know it at the time. Jiriya taught Naruto basic chakra control, the summoning jutsu, and the rasengan.\n\nBecause of Jiriya, Naruto also formed a connection with the Toad Sages. This led to Naruto getting the opportunity to learn Senjutsu. Yes Naruto worked really hard to master Sage Mode, but few Shinobi ever get the chance to attempt it. And Naruto benefitted from Jiriya's longtime friend/teacher dedicating himself to Naruto's sage training after Jiriya died. \n\nBecause of Jiriya, Naruto also developed a personal relationship with Pain during their fight. This connection allowed Naruto the opportunity to negotiate with Nagato, which allowed for the resurrection of the dead Leaf Shinobi. Was this also the result of Naruto's choices? Yes. Could anyone else have pulled this off? Almost certainly not. Nagato only cared about Naruto's philosophy because they had the same teacher.\n\nNaruto also benefitted from Kakashi, who was assigned to team 7 partly because of the connection Kakashi shared with both Naruto and Sasuke. Kakashi, though not until mid Shippuden, taught Naruto how to harness shadow clones for training. Kakashi also leveraged his own connections to recruit Yamato for the sole purpose of sitting still all day to assist Naruto with training by suppressing Kurama's chakra. \n\nAnd being an Ashura incarnate led directly to Naruto receiving the Six Paths abilities which: amplified Naruto's healing abilities to the point he could regenerate even other people's body parts, greatly improved his stamina and strength, gave him truth seeking orbs, and let him naturally fly.",

People forget that Naruto had been working hard to practice the clone technique for a long time prior to him jumping to a thousand shadow clones. But when Iruka displayed confidence in Naruto all of a sudden found it within himself to make a thousand shadow clones when before he couldn't even do a single regular clone.\n\nThat was what Naruto was telling Neji. To stop bemoaning an alleged fate and have the confidence to make your own path even calling him a genius unlike him (Naruto). And that sticks with Neji to the point that it's something he says before he finishes off Kidomaru.",
