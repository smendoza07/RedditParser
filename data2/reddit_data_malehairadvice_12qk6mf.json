We work 40 -60 hours a week and we are \"tired\" or \"don't have time\" to exercise. It's a BS excuse. Become masculine and look solid. Exercise like your life depends on it. When you exercise just repeat to yourself \"I do this to destroy those who want to harm my family\".   When you exercise be aggressive. Explode with energy.  Don't just lift weights to lift weights. Create an enemy. Destroy that enemy in your head when you exercise. \n\n\nRemember that any one you attract now is going to less than mediocre.  Become fit and masculine and you will attract way better people. That goes for friends and romantic relationships.  \n\nGood luck man. You have awesome hair. I have to keep mine very very very very short because of the quality of my hair. It's like a rug. I tried to grow it out.

You won't win a prize if it reaches a certain length and you won't lose anything except hair when you cut it off. If you want to feel good about yourself and give your ego a boost, then go ahead and cut 10-12 inches from it and donate it for a cancer cause. \n\nAt the end of the day, this is just advice, you can wear your hair however you like, just don't let your hair wear you.",

It took me 4 whole years for it to reach shoulder length, and I loved it. Later on I was going through somewhat of a personal \"slump\" in my life and wanted to make a change and feel like I had some degree of control, so on a whim I decided to cut off my still long hair short for a \"new look, new me\" sort of situation.\n\nHuge regret, I fucking HATED the short hair look. And I could do nothing but wait for it to grow again, which is three years and counting (I'm barely past the ears right now).\n\nBasically, think very carefully if you're willing to give up long hair for something new, because if you regret it it's not an instant fix.",

If a few days later you still don\u2019t want it, cut more. Maybe shoulder length. I\u2019d do it this way because at least then you won\u2019t regret cutting it all off. You seem to have incredibly good hair. It suits your entire look, but I think a short slicked back (I call it the Italian mobster style b/c I have no clue what it would be called) would look good on you. Google some styles at different lengths. See what you like. Just don\u2019t cut it all at once if you have the means to cut it in small increments.",
