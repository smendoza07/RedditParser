    "body": "When I first started RM, I kept seeing \"Nation's MC\" everytime Jaesuk did something/anything. He does his signature dance move? \"Nation's MC\" pops up. He does something nice? \"Nation's MC\" appears again.\n\nI thought, \"Okaaay... Weird flex, but okay.\" I chalked it up to them (RM prod) building him up and giving him a nickname to boost views and memorability. Cause it's their show, y'know, *of course* they want their member to have memorable nicknames.\n\n***Boy, was I wrong.***\n\nThe more episodes I watched, the more I realized it wasn't an exaggeration. Every time they went out, more people would flock to Jaesuk compared to the other members. Even with all the hotshot celebrity guests they have, people *still* go to Jaesuk.\n\nAnd then I'd hear comments about him from other people. Celebs, passersby, the fricking entertainment news outlets. Remember that one news about him discretely doing monthly sponsorships at a hospital. *Dude*. Not to mention the yearly rankings and the awards he consistently sweeps.\n\nThey didn't call him the Nation's MC just for kicks. They didn't do it just for the show.\n\nThey call YJS the Nation's MC, because he *is* the Nation's MC.",

I forget if RM or IC but there were a couple of hidden camera situations, one where they put an old lady struggling with groceries to see what each member would do and YJS had one of his assistants drive her home!  Another was a speeding car in a narrow street as members walk with a female assistant and YJS naturally pulled her away so that he was more exposed to the danger.  Love this guy.",

Lee Sang Min is apparently in 5 shows but probably only MUD and Knowing Brothers is more known. Jang Sung Kyu was also in a lot of shows when he broke out too. Kim Sook is also in a lot of shows that did well domestically which was what helped her win the Daesang (boss in the mirror, problem child in the house) but I feel those aren\u2019t internationally popular.",

I remember one of the pd saying that he called YJS to share with him the happy news that one of their episodes hit a really high viewer rating and YJS in turn discussed with him for about 2 hours on how they could improve the planning of the program lmao. The hardest working man on television, my lazy ass could never.",

Nowadays, after watching rm and all his other shows i definitely understand. It\u2019s his mad skills to operate the flow of the show. I think one commenter from a past thread compare him to a traffic enforcer. Manipulate traffic. We can definitely see that through episodes where other members was able to MC like seokjin and haha and maybe others. They can\u2019t handle MC\u2019ing well and still they passed the job back to yoo jae suk lol. Also remember when they were in Mongolia and he was able to translate accurately even though he doesn\u2019t know the language? In how do you play, when the refund sisters first met each other yjs was able interpret the vibe of each and the overall vibe. He has the ability to recognise other\u2019s intentions and feelings. In psychology, i think they can call him an interpersonal genius.",

Even in Knowing Brothers, the punchlines about him still focus on \u201chierarchy/seniority\u201d. I do think a lot of the guests\u2019 Star King accusations are exaggerated, but has a little bit of truth in them. Now I notice that he\u2019s more ok with being the punching-bag of jokes, which makes him more approachable unlike in his Star King days",

That time it's just really nonsense and i don't believe it.

Lee Sang Min is apparently in 5 shows but probably only MUD and Knowing Brothers is more known. Jang Sung Kyu was also in a lot of shows when he broke out too. Kim Sook is also in a lot of shows that did well domestically which was what helped her win the Daesang (boss in the mirror, problem child in the house) but I feel those aren\u2019t internationally popular.",
