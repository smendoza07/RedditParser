Personally I see this game's story as semi canon because the recruitment scenes were different from the anime/manga and in the end it implies all the Akatuski members were in the group at the same time, when we know some of them had actually already died then replaced with other people, but the games shows every single member that ever joined in one room having a meeting. There is also another short story from the same game that showed the events that led to Shisui dying and losing his eyes. There were some inconsistencies with that story aswell. He was was shown to have a green incomplete Susanoo made from one eye when Danzo stole his other eye, which we only ever see in the game. The anime and manga have this scene play out differently, then there's a supposedly canon novel that showed the same scene play out in a different way (such as Shisui losing his eye indoors and poisoned by an Aburame) but the anime and game don't have those scenes. The Susanoo was designed by Kishimoto so most consider Shisui having it as canon.",

This only applies to him, and be it for old age or fear, Yamato and his squad don't really do much, as seen when Team 9 (Think it's team 9) got into Orochimaru's lab, which should be a no-go under ANY circumstance. He's still seen to have highly advanced tools and human holding pods, which point to him still doing human experiments.\nNow, he's... a parent to Mitsuki. Mitsuki is a lab-created, genetically-improved human experiment. He's done at least 2 of these (as proved by the existence of Mitsuki's brother), but it's hinted that more have been attempted/exist. Orochimaru has no reason not to implant a part of his soul into them so he can keep on living and be reincarnated through them.\nNow you can go, \"Sure, he might be still reviving, but Konoha can't be letting him get away with his immortality shenanigans.\". Konoha *is* indeed letting him. Orochimaru's technique consists of him switching bodies every three years unless he finds a perfect host, which would be a host that doesn't reject him. This has always been a sort of weird concept that wasn't very well explained throughout the series, but the two perfect hosts he ever found were Sasuke and Kiminaro. Now, Kimimaro is dead and Sasuke is still alive and strong going around, and he's off the plate. This means that unless Orochimaru has improved the immortality jutsu he still needs to switch. Even if he has improved it, the body he's possessing still naturally ages, so he eventually has to switch.\nDuring an episode of boruto where Orochimaru appears and meets boruto for the first time, he re-states his goal of \"finding the truth about everything in the world\". This means that he still has his original goal in mind, and he still needs immortality to accomplish it. With all of this together, and the clear improvement that Orochimaru was shown to have over his life-insuring jutsu, (his renegeration jutsu that is so overpowered to the point of making Tsunade's feel like a weaker version), we can make the very safe assumption that he's still going strong at it, and he's always finding more stuff that makes him immortal.\n\nEDIT: Spelling.",

Without his arms or traditional jutsu Orochimaru held out against four tails Naruto and stood up to Jiraiya, and he defeated both the fourth Kazekage and the third Hokage, two extremely skilled shinobi (albeit one as an elderly). I'm willing to bet an Orochimaru pre-Destroy Konoha could actually beat Pain in an all-out fight. Especially when considering his ability to summon the first and second Hokage, and honestly who knows who else, which even in their weakened state from Orochimaru's unrefined Edo Tensei they would still be a massive asset against the paths of pain. I would wager Orochimaru with arms in tact could take Pain, although it would be a tough fight for sure. \n\nNow, Itachi is a much harder fight for him. I'm not an itachi fan boy by any means but the guy is busted and the manga literally has Orochimaru say he's too much for him. I feel like it wouldn't be a stomp, but I don't think he wins against Itachi.",

He did not hold out against Naruto 4 tails lmao. The dude was getting smacked like Pinball without him making even a scratch on 4 tails even with kusanagi. He just left before things got worse. \n\nHe is not beating pain lmao. The rinnegan is utterly broken tool. It's worse than the bloody sharingan. You're talking about the dude who fought top Jounins in the leaf in 6 places at once. Then Nuked the leaf. Immobilized Naruto, fought 8 tails, used Chibaku Tensai and still had power to revive the leaf. Orochimaru weak Edo Tensai are no match for the 6 paths of pain. The dude pain can fucking suck the soul out of the body without using shit like reaper death seal. So weak edos are useless.\n\nOrochimaru needed two villages and still wasn't fully successful against the leaf. Pain single-handedly slaughtered the whole population present.\n\nThe dude joined Akatsuki for a reason. He knew he was outmatched against the likes of Pain. So might as well watch the fun from a close distance rather being slaughtered by pain. The man picks his battles carefully. Thats why didn't make any big attempts at stealing the rinnegan. The dude loves special eyes. You think he wouldn't have gotten it if he could?\n\nItachi humiliated him some 3 times before he gave up on him too lmao. Sasuke deadass absorbed him and then gave up on Sasuke too after he came back to life. \n\nMan has not lived so long by picking bad battles. He even is in hiding from the Akatsuki for years to not invoke their wrath upon him.",

Personally I see this game's story as semi canon because the recruitment scenes were different from the anime/manga and in the end it implies all the Akatuski members were in the group at the same time, when we know some of them had actually already died then replaced with other people, but the games shows every single member that ever joined in one room having a meeting. There is also another short story from the same game that showed the events that led to Shisui dying and losing his eyes. There were some inconsistencies with that story aswell. He was was shown to have a green incomplete Susanoo made from one eye when Danzo stole his other eye, which we only ever see in the game. The anime and manga have this scene play out differently, then there's a supposedly canon novel that showed the same scene play out in a different way (such as Shisui losing his eye indoors and poisoned by an Aburame) but the anime and game don't have those scenes. The Susanoo was designed by Kishimoto so most consider Shisui having it as canon.",

It's Sunday, and I'd rather be sleeping than going in circles with a stranger.\n\nSecond of I would like to establish that no matter your opinion, Boruto is cannon. It's written by Kishimoto as a follow-up to the Naruto series.\n\nOrochimaru is seen to still have his laboratory and organisation nowadays. There's only one condition which is wherever he goes he needs to be monitored by Yamato and his squad. This only applies to him, and be it for old age or fear, Yamato and his squad don't really do much, as seen when Team 9 (Think it's team 9) got into Orochimaru's lab, which should be a no-go under ANY circumstance. He's still seen to have highly advanced tools and human holding pods, which point to him still doing human experiments.\nNow, he's... a parent to Mitsuki. Mitsuki is a lab-created, genetically-improved human experiment. He's done at least 2 of these (as proved by the existence of Mitsuki's brother), but it's hinted that more have been attempted/exist. Orochimaru has no reason not to implant a part of his soul into them so he can keep on living and be reincarnated through them.\nNow you can go, \"Sure, he might be still reviving, but Konoha can't be letting him get away with his immortality shenanigans.\". Konoha *is* indeed letting him. Orochimaru's technique consists of him switching bodies every three years unless he finds a perfect host, which would be a host that doesn't reject him. This has always been a sort of weird concept that wasn't very well explained throughout the series, but the two perfect hosts he ever found were Sasuke and Kiminaro. Now, Kimimaro is dead and Sasuke is still alive and strong going around, and he's off the plate. This means that unless Orochimaru has improved the immortality jutsu he still needs to switch. Even if he has improved it, the body he's possessing still naturally ages, so he eventually has to switch.\nDuring an episode of boruto where Orochimaru appears and meets boruto for the first time, he re-states his goal of \"finding the truth about everything in the world\". This means that he still has his original goal in mind, and he still needs immortality to accomplish it. With all of this together, and the clear improvement that Orochimaru was shown to have over his life-insuring jutsu, (his renegeration jutsu that is so overpowered to the point of making Tsunade's feel like a weaker version), we can make the very safe assumption that he's still going strong at it, and he's always finding more stuff that makes him immortal.\n\nEDIT: Spelling.",

The dude was getting smacked like Pinball without him making even a scratch on 4 tails even with kusanagi. He just left before things got worse. \n\nHe is not beating pain lmao. The rinnegan is utterly broken tool. It's worse than the bloody sharingan. You're talking about the dude who fought top Jounins in the leaf in 6 places at once. Then Nuked the leaf. Immobilized Naruto, fought 8 tails, used Chibaku Tensai and still had power to revive the leaf. Orochimaru weak Edo Tensai are no match for the 6 paths of pain. The dude pain can fucking suck the soul out of the body without using shit like reaper death seal. So weak edos are useless.\n\nOrochimaru needed two villages and still wasn't fully successful against the leaf. Pain single-handedly slaughtered the whole population present.\n\nThe dude joined Akatsuki for a reason. He knew he was outmatched against the likes of Pain. So might as well watch the fun from a close distance rather being slaughtered by pain. The man picks his battles carefully. Thats why didn't make any big attempts at stealing the rinnegan. The dude loves special eyes. You think he wouldn't have gotten it if he could?\n\nItachi humiliated him some 3 times before he gave up on him too lmao. Sasuke deadass absorbed him and then gave up on Sasuke too after he came back to life. \n\nMan has not lived so long by picking bad battles. He even is in hiding from the Akatsuki for years to not invoke their wrath upon him.",

It's Sunday, and I'd rather be sleeping than going in circles with a stranger.\n\nSecond of I would like to establish that no matter your opinion, Boruto is cannon. It's written by Kishimoto as a follow-up to the Naruto series.\n\nOrochimaru is seen to still have his laboratory and organisation nowadays. There's only one condition which is wherever he goes he needs to be monitored by Yamato and his squad. This only applies to him, and be it for old age or fear, Yamato and his squad don't really do much, as seen when Team 9 (Think it's team 9) got into Orochimaru's lab, which should be a no-go under ANY circumstance. He's still seen to have highly advanced tools and human holding pods, which point to him still doing human experiments.\nNow, he's... a parent to Mitsuki. Mitsuki is a lab-created, genetically-improved human experiment. He's done at least 2 of these (as proved by the existence of Mitsuki's brother), but it's hinted that more have been attempted/exist. Orochimaru has no reason not to implant a part of his soul into them so he can keep on living and be reincarnated through them.\nNow you can go, \"Sure, he might be still reviving, but Konoha can't be letting him get away with his immortality shenanigans.\". Konoha *is* indeed letting him. Orochimaru's technique consists of him switching bodies every three years unless he finds a perfect host, which would be a host that doesn't reject him. This has always been a sort of weird concept that wasn't very well explained throughout the series, but the two perfect hosts he ever found were Sasuke and Kiminaro. Now, Kimimaro is dead and Sasuke is still alive and strong going around, and he's off the plate. This means that unless Orochimaru has improved the immortality jutsu he still needs to switch. Even if he has improved it, the body he's possessing still naturally ages, so he eventually has to switch.\nDuring an episode of boruto where Orochimaru appears and meets boruto for the first time, he re-states his goal of \"finding the truth about everything in the world\". This means that he still has his original goal in mind, and he still needs immortality to accomplish it. With all of this together, and the clear improvement that Orochimaru was shown to have over his life-insuring jutsu, (his renegeration jutsu that is so overpowered to the point of making Tsunade's feel like a weaker version), we can make the very safe assumption that he's still going strong at it, and he's always finding more stuff that makes him immortal.\n\nEDIT: Spelling.",

Rinnegan only comes from Hagoromo chakra and above, which is why Madara (Indra reincarnation) was able to get it when attaching Hashirama Cells (Ashura reincarnation) to himself. Itachi couldn't ever get the Rinnegan unless he took Madara's eyes, same case with Obito and rest of the Uchihas minus Sasuke. Sharingan only evolves to Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan, which is busted on its own",

It's Sunday, and I'd rather be sleeping than going in circles with a stranger.\n\nSecond of I would like to establish that no matter your opinion, Boruto is cannon. It's written by Kishimoto as a follow-up to the Naruto series.\n\nOrochimaru is seen to still have his laboratory and organisation nowadays. There's only one condition which is wherever he goes he needs to be monitored by Yamato and his squad. This only applies to him, and be it for old age or fear, Yamato and his squad don't really do much, as seen when Team 9 (Think it's team 9) got into Orochimaru's lab, which should be a no-go under ANY circumstance. He's still seen to have highly advanced tools and human holding pods, which point to him still doing human experiments.\nNow, he's... a parent to Mitsuki. Mitsuki is a lab-created, genetically-improved human experiment. He's done at least 2 of these (as proved by the existence of Mitsuki's brother), but it's hinted that more have been attempted/exist. Orochimaru has no reason not to implant a part of his soul into them so he can keep on living and be reincarnated through them.\nNow you can go, \"Sure, he might be still reviving, but Konoha can't be letting him get away with his immortality shenanigans.\". Konoha *is* indeed letting him. Orochimaru's technique consists of him switching bodies every three years unless he finds a perfect host, which would be a host that doesn't reject him. This has always been a sort of weird concept that wasn't very well explained throughout the series, but the two perfect hosts he ever found were Sasuke and Kiminaro. Now, Kimimaro is dead and Sasuke is still alive and strong going around, and he's off the plate. This means that unless Orochimaru has improved the immortality jutsu he still needs to switch. Even if he has improved it, the body he's possessing still naturally ages, so he eventually has to switch.\nDuring an episode of boruto where Orochimaru appears and meets boruto for the first time, he re-states his goal of \"finding the truth about everything in the world\". This means that he still has his original goal in mind, and he still needs immortality to accomplish it. With all of this together, and the clear improvement that Orochimaru was shown to have over his life-insuring jutsu, (his renegeration jutsu that is so overpowered to the point of making Tsunade's feel like a weaker version), we can make the very safe assumption that he's still going strong at it, and he's always finding more stuff that makes him immortal.\n\nEDIT: Spelling.",

It's Sunday, and I'd rather be sleeping than going in circles with a stranger.\n\nSecond of I would like to establish that no matter your opinion, Boruto is cannon. It's written by Kishimoto as a follow-up to the Naruto series.\n\nOrochimaru is seen to still have his laboratory and organisation nowadays. There's only one condition which is wherever he goes he needs to be monitored by Yamato and his squad. This only applies to him, and be it for old age or fear, Yamato and his squad don't really do much, as seen when Team 9 (Think it's team 9) got into Orochimaru's lab, which should be a no-go under ANY circumstance. He's still seen to have highly advanced tools and human holding pods, which point to him still doing human experiments.\nNow, he's... a parent to Mitsuki. Mitsuki is a lab-created, genetically-improved human experiment. He's done at least 2 of these (as proved by the existence of Mitsuki's brother), but it's hinted that more have been attempted/exist. Orochimaru has no reason not to implant a part of his soul into them so he can keep on living and be reincarnated through them.\nNow you can go, \"Sure, he might be still reviving, but Konoha can't be letting him get away with his immortality shenanigans.\". Konoha *is* indeed letting him. Orochimaru's technique consists of him switching bodies every three years unless he finds a perfect host, which would be a host that doesn't reject him. This has always been a sort of weird concept that wasn't very well explained throughout the series, but the two perfect hosts he ever found were Sasuke and Kiminaro. Now, Kimimaro is dead and Sasuke is still alive and strong going around, and he's off the plate. This means that unless Orochimaru has improved the immortality jutsu he still needs to switch. Even if he has improved it, the body he's possessing still naturally ages, so he eventually has to switch.\nDuring an episode of boruto where Orochimaru appears and meets boruto for the first time, he re-states his goal of \"finding the truth about everything in the world\". This means that he still has his original goal in mind, and he still needs immortality to accomplish it. With all of this together, and the clear improvement that Orochimaru was shown to have over his life-insuring jutsu, (his renegeration jutsu that is so overpowered to the point of making Tsunade's feel like a weaker version), we can make the very safe assumption that he's still going strong at it, and he's always finding more stuff that makes him immortal.\n\nEDIT: Spelling.",

Rinnegan only comes from Hagoromo chakra and above, which is why Madara (Indra reincarnation) was able to get it when attaching Hashirama Cells (Ashura reincarnation) to himself. Itachi couldn't ever get the Rinnegan unless he took Madara's eyes, same case with Obito and rest of the Uchihas minus Sasuke. Sharingan only evolves to Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan, which is busted on its own",

It's Sunday, and I'd rather be sleeping than going in circles with a stranger.\n\nSecond of I would like to establish that no matter your opinion, Boruto is cannon. It's written by Kishimoto as a follow-up to the Naruto series.\n\nOrochimaru is seen to still have his laboratory and organisation nowadays. There's only one condition which is wherever he goes he needs to be monitored by Yamato and his squad. This only applies to him, and be it for old age or fear, Yamato and his squad don't really do much, as seen when Team 9 (Think it's team 9) got into Orochimaru's lab, which should be a no-go under ANY circumstance. He's still seen to have highly advanced tools and human holding pods, which point to him still doing human experiments.\nNow, he's... a parent to Mitsuki. Mitsuki is a lab-created, genetically-improved human experiment. He's done at least 2 of these (as proved by the existence of Mitsuki's brother), but it's hinted that more have been attempted/exist. Orochimaru has no reason not to implant a part of his soul into them so he can keep on living and be reincarnated through them.\nNow you can go, \"Sure, he might be still reviving, but Konoha can't be letting him get away with his immortality shenanigans.\". Konoha *is* indeed letting him. Orochimaru's technique consists of him switching bodies every three years unless he finds a perfect host, which would be a host that doesn't reject him. This has always been a sort of weird concept that wasn't very well explained throughout the series, but the two perfect hosts he ever found were Sasuke and Kiminaro. Now, Kimimaro is dead and Sasuke is still alive and strong going around, and he's off the plate. This means that unless Orochimaru has improved the immortality jutsu he still needs to switch. Even if he has improved it, the body he's possessing still naturally ages, so he eventually has to switch.\nDuring an episode of boruto where Orochimaru appears and meets boruto for the first time, he re-states his goal of \"finding the truth about everything in the world\". This means that he still has his original goal in mind, and he still needs immortality to accomplish it. With all of this together, and the clear improvement that Orochimaru was shown to have over his life-insuring jutsu, (his renegeration jutsu that is so overpowered to the point of making Tsunade's feel like a weaker version), we can make the very safe assumption that he's still going strong at it, and he's always finding more stuff that makes him immortal.\n\nEDIT: Spelling.",

It's Sunday, and I'd rather be sleeping than going in circles with a stranger.\n\nSecond of I would like to establish that no matter your opinion, Boruto is cannon. It's written by Kishimoto as a follow-up to the Naruto series.\n\nOrochimaru is seen to still have his laboratory and organisation nowadays. There's only one condition which is wherever he goes he needs to be monitored by Yamato and his squad. This only applies to him, and be it for old age or fear, Yamato and his squad don't really do much, as seen when Team 9 (Think it's team 9) got into Orochimaru's lab, which should be a no-go under ANY circumstance. He's still seen to have highly advanced tools and human holding pods, which point to him still doing human experiments.\nNow, he's... a parent to Mitsuki. Mitsuki is a lab-created, genetically-improved human experiment. He's done at least 2 of these (as proved by the existence of Mitsuki's brother), but it's hinted that more have been attempted/exist. Orochimaru has no reason not to implant a part of his soul into them so he can keep on living and be reincarnated through them.\nNow you can go, \"Sure, he might be still reviving, but Konoha can't be letting him get away with his immortality shenanigans.\". Konoha *is* indeed letting him. Orochimaru's technique consists of him switching bodies every three years unless he finds a perfect host, which would be a host that doesn't reject him. This has always been a sort of weird concept that wasn't very well explained throughout the series, but the two perfect hosts he ever found were Sasuke and Kiminaro. Now, Kimimaro is dead and Sasuke is still alive and strong going around, and he's off the plate. This means that unless Orochimaru has improved the immortality jutsu he still needs to switch. Even if he has improved it, the body he's possessing still naturally ages, so he eventually has to switch.\nDuring an episode of boruto where Orochimaru appears and meets boruto for the first time, he re-states his goal of \"finding the truth about everything in the world\". This means that he still has his original goal in mind, and he still needs immortality to accomplish it. With all of this together, and the clear improvement that Orochimaru was shown to have over his life-insuring jutsu, (his renegeration jutsu that is so overpowered to the point of making Tsunade's feel like a weaker version), we can make the very safe assumption that he's still going strong at it, and he's always finding more stuff that makes him immortal.\n\nEDIT: Spelling.",
