    "body": "...and I\u2019ve only just discovered this sub. Hello. I\u2019m a career woman and I\u2019ve never relied on sugaring for my actual expenses- just was fun on the side (and has been), and has helped me build up quite the investment portfolio.\n\nCurrently I rotate between 2 SDs, because of my job I am vaccinated. They treat me well.\n\nI was in the bowl through college and then grad school- haven\u2019t been in a non-SD/SB relationship in all that time. Why? Because I learned early on that men don\u2019t tend to value things unless they pay for it. And frankly I feel that my daddies treat me so much better than these shmucks on dating apps. I let a guy take me out from tinder once and he asked me to split the bill for a coffee. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m an open book. AMA.",

                    "body": "I think my best advice would be, don\u2019t take anything personally, and don\u2019t get too emotionally invested. The arrangement buys you a certain degree of arms\u2019 length interaction and you should treat it as such. If he didn\u2019t text you back right away, that\u2019s okay, if you gave him access to your private photos and he stopped talking to you; that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not personal. Brush it off and move on. It\u2019s the most important \u201ctrick\u201d to the bowl I think.\n\nWorst SD- when I was very young (21) I had a daddy who didn\u2019t tell me he had a kink. We were mid coitus and he started sucking on my toes, moaning and groaning in the most crass, vulgar way lmao. He came on my toes then licked it off. Yeah. I had to break that off lol. I mean, let a girl know??\n\nI guess he\u2019s the weirdest- but the WORST is a daddy who tried to get me to pay for an Airbnb up front and then flaked on me that morning. I got him to pay me back (this whole situation was against my better judgment tbh) and we met up another time and he doubled my ppm to say sorry, but he generally was garbage at communicating and was always so needy- texted every 2 hours and if I didn\u2019t reply immediately he would be like, \u201care you upset with me?\u201d Yeah, I had to cut that off :-/",

I message all the girls who meet my search criteria and send them my private links.  Then I wait. Within a week I have 3-4 M&Gs set up.   For me, the profiles...I don't read them.  It all starts with the M&G.  I'll get a few terms & conditions out of the way prior to that, but, as they say, you know within 2 minutes whether you want to move forward or not.\n\nI also get right to the nature of an arrangement...moving on.  It sounds weird, but one topic I cover at the M&G is the ending.  I make it clear that I'm not looking for the future Mrs.  Like all my previous SRs, this too will end.\n\nBTW, my SB just turned 49.  As you said in a prior reply, if you keep yourself together...any age is possible.  (The bell tolls loudest in your 30's)",

For both parties. Respect each other\u2019s parameters. And If you have issues with that it\u2019s time to cut it off.\n-if your instincts tell you it\u2019s a bad idea, it\u2019s a bad idea. Men who don\u2019t respect boundaries, or constantly ask you to compromise and don\u2019t abide by their commitments, are a red flag. There is a ton of gray of course but as long as the basic parameters are well communicated, you can have a pretty good idea of what should be the \u201cstraw that breaks the camel\u2019s back\u201d for you.\n- the m&g is extremely, extremely important. I\u2019m very very private and never disclose what I want $ for, I usually say to help pay rent, but always express that I appreciate the support. I usually explain single bf I\u2019ve ever had has supported me has supported me in some way, because it\u2019s true. I\u2019ve had SDs pay my tuition, my rent, etc, for years and years. Expressions of appreciation are really appreciated by SDs.\n\nAnd lastly, most importantly- NOTHING IS PERSONAL. If he dumped you- that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not personal. He didn\u2019t want to see you after M&G- not personal: I feel like that\u2019s what an arrangement buys you- a level of impersonality that you should not interpret to be any fault of yours.",

Rarely is it a month or less. I\u2019ve had a four year relationship, and I currently have a 3 year relationship. That\u2019s means it\u2019s easy. We click. No drama. The intimacy with someone I care about is more important than anything to me. It\u2019s mutual.\n\nWe have a budget too. My income is significant to most, but I have expenses you don\u2019t have. Our life styles increase as we earn more.  My annual home mortgage is more than I earned 30 years ago. Pay for our kids education, I\u2019m doing it, it\u2019s expensive. Taxes are increasing. You focus more and more on retirement savings. As a percentage of our income we may not pay a lot for sugaring, but we\u2019re not living like a lot of women who are younger, with your expenses and tons of money sitting around each month. I\u2019m not complaining at all, I compensate on the higher end for my SB. \n\nAlways remember this: there are exceptions, but we\u2019re not from the lucky sperm club with inherited wealth. We\u2019ve been dirt poor, I\u2019ve lived in my car. We remember what it\u2019s like to have much less than we have now, don\u2019t act like we don\u2019t get what you\u2019re going through. We\u2019re not an ATM. We\u2019ll help you out the longer we\u2019re together because we want to, not because you feel we\u2019re supposed to.",

I have had one daddy (my current one actually) say, I don\u2019t like talking about money, so I gave him a kiss and said I\u2019m sorry. But brought it up over text that next week, when I said, my rent is due next week and I would appreciate it :) :) (he had said he was open to supporting already but hated talking numbers in person- felt too transactional).\n\nOther guys prefer to know up front- I let them drive the convo generally. They ask questions (what is your expectation) and I answer sincerely and honestly. If there\u2019s a negotiation, I give reasons- it\u2019s a far drive, it\u2019s asking for a lot to only meet at night, etc. and I set clear boundaries on my best and final.

Just don\u2019t risk it. Use diff photos for SA than anything else, just a suggestion",

I\u2019m 28 and have two SR\u2019s at the moment - one with a man in his late 50s and another with a man in his early 60s. \n\n1. How do you deal with the SD\u2019s family? My SD has two kids both my age or a bit older. How do you overcome the awkwardness?\n\n2. What are your thoughts on having an SR with a married man? \n\n3. How do you renegotiate your PPM arrangement?",

If they talk too much about their wife/kids I smile sweetly and say, you know, I really like our time together to be about us :) and that ends it pretty quickly. Then I forgot I ever heard it.\n\nA renegotiation can come up for any # of reasons, change in life circumstance, he\u2019s asking for more than usual, he had been wanting to meet more often. I\u2019m always sweet as pie about it and let him know if he\u2019s not interested in renegotiation just lmk and I will determine my next steps accordingly. Some guys are worth sticking around even if your renegotiation is not successful, but most of the time if you give legit reasons (yes, they can be lies), they will be accommodating",

It worked out okay as I\u2019m in an SR with this person now, but was this a mistake in your view? What should I do differently next time?",

Actually, I\u2019ve always connected better with men older than me and professionals. I\u2019m considered fairly intelligent in the 100th percentile and thus is more attracted to those who use their head. But I never had tons of education because I couldn\u2019t afford it. But I love talking about anything and could enjoy a conversation about stock exchange, cardio thoracic surgery, geology, or quantum mechanic all the same, without being a expert in the field. Which is in part why i thought this could work for me, and being an artist, having a sponsor could really change things. \n\nBut I\u2019m not the prettiest girl around. I\u2019m not bad looking, but far from a super model. I\u2019m curvy (not unlike you, most of it is hips and butt), and I\u2019m now 36 (though people keep telling me I look no more than in my 20\u2019s). And like a lot of intellectuals, I can be a little clumsily socially at time and a bit shy. So all those girl showing perfect os\u00e9e pictures of models in their early 20\u2019s at most, it really intimidated me out of it. \n\nBut times are changing and I\u2019m considering this more and more, only now, at my age, I\u2019ve started to ask myself if it\u2019s not too late. \n\nSo seeing this post really open my eyes. I\u2019ve heard some negative comments in the past. I\u2019m seen and interview of a curvy sugar baby once that spoke of how curvy and fat babies had to lower their standard and suck those d**k to get the money and to not ask or expect too much of their daddies other than money, and it sounded more like prostitution than anything else. And I\u2019d like to get more than just money. Not necessarily love, but at least be able to develop some level of connection and have a good time. This Reddit has sown me a lot of good examples of sugaring though, for which I\u2019m very appreciative. I\u2019ve learned a lot. Thanks to everyone.",

Most of my relationships have ended very amicably- oh I\u2019m busy with work and don\u2019t have time to see you anymore, my wife wants to give it another shot, I\u2019m afraid of the covid numbers rising and want to limit my social bubble... any and all reasons are unrelated to me IMO and I let them go. No problem.\n\nI don\u2019t recommend freestyling tbh: many men are unfamiliar with sugaring and I think it\u2019s risky, I\u2019d prefer to meet men on SA who know up front what they want. Try searching and then messaging guys directly. I\u2019m baffled by how few women do this",

I have not tried that yet.\n\n- Do you charge PPM for a meet and greet or the M&G is free? \n\n- Is the allowance or PPM paid upfront? Have you ever had a SD flake out and not pay you? \n\n- Aside from the things you've already mentioned in this thread (I read them all), any other parameters or boundaries you set at the beginning of a sugar relationship and explicitly discuss? Emotional, physical, sexual and privacy wise?\n\n- Any \"do not do\" on a first meet? Like putting out, kissing, talk about certain things? \n\n- You mentioned some men can be vengeful, what's the worst experience you've had with that?\n\n- How do you maintain your privacy (ID, workplace, etc)? Do you use your real identity or a fake one, also do you lie about where you work or do for privacy or you simply tell them you'd rather not share? I personally wouldn't even share my phone nb unless it's someone I've known long enough to trust (I use chat apps with handles instead). I would definitely not allow them to know where I live.\n\n- Safety advice? Do you let someone know where you're going when you meet a SD?\n\nThanks and very much appreciated!",

            "body": "I think my best advice would be, don\u2019t take anything personally, and don\u2019t get too emotionally invested. The arrangement buys you a certain degree of arms\u2019 length interaction and you should treat it as such. If he didn\u2019t text you back right away, that\u2019s okay, if you gave him access to your private photos and he stopped talking to you; that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not personal. Brush it off and move on. It\u2019s the most important \u201ctrick\u201d to the bowl I think.\n\nWorst SD- when I was very young (21) I had a daddy who didn\u2019t tell me he had a kink. We were mid coitus and he started sucking on my toes, moaning and groaning in the most crass, vulgar way lmao. He came on my toes then licked it off. Yeah. I had to break that off lol. I mean, let a girl know??\n\nI guess he\u2019s the weirdest- but the WORST is a daddy who tried to get me to pay for an Airbnb up front and then flaked on me that morning. I got him to pay me back (this whole situation was against my better judgment tbh) and we met up another time and he doubled my ppm to say sorry, but he generally was garbage at communicating and was always so needy- texted every 2 hours and if I didn\u2019t reply immediately he would be like, \u201care you upset with me?\u201d Yeah, I had to cut that off :-/",

For both parties. Respect each other\u2019s parameters. And If you have issues with that it\u2019s time to cut it off.\n-if your instincts tell you it\u2019s a bad idea, it\u2019s a bad idea. Men who don\u2019t respect boundaries, or constantly ask you to compromise and don\u2019t abide by their commitments, are a red flag. There is a ton of gray of course but as long as the basic parameters are well communicated, you can have a pretty good idea of what should be the \u201cstraw that breaks the camel\u2019s back\u201d for you.\n- the m&g is extremely, extremely important. I\u2019m very very private and never disclose what I want $ for, I usually say to help pay rent, but always express that I appreciate the support. I usually explain single bf I\u2019ve ever had has supported me has supported me in some way, because it\u2019s true. I\u2019ve had SDs pay my tuition, my rent, etc, for years and years. Expressions of appreciation are really appreciated by SDs.\n\nAnd lastly, most importantly- NOTHING IS PERSONAL. If he dumped you- that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not personal. He didn\u2019t want to see you after M&G- not personal: I feel like that\u2019s what an arrangement buys you- a level of impersonality that you should not interpret to be any fault of yours.",

I have had one daddy (my current one actually) say, I don\u2019t like talking about money, so I gave him a kiss and said I\u2019m sorry. But brought it up over text that next week, when I said, my rent is due next week and I would appreciate it :) :) (he had said he was open to supporting already but hated talking numbers in person- felt too transactional).\n\nOther guys prefer to know up front- I let them drive the convo generally. They ask questions (what is your expectation) and I answer sincerely and honestly. If there\u2019s a negotiation, I give reasons- it\u2019s a far drive, it\u2019s asking for a lot to only meet at night, etc. and I set clear boundaries on my best and final.

We still talk. \n\nGeneral reasons why SRs end- to be frank, some men are done scratching the itch after a few months, some actually want a girlfriend, some stop wanting to pay an allowance, some go back to their girlfriends or wives. It really runs the gamut. But I take none of these personally, I have had to break up with a Sd here and there because of boundary issues, poor communication, or flakiness. But nothing egregious.",

Actually, I\u2019ve always connected better with men older than me and professionals. I\u2019m considered fairly intelligent in the 100th percentile and thus is more attracted to those who use their head. But I never had tons of education because I couldn\u2019t afford it. But I love talking about anything and could enjoy a conversation about stock exchange, cardio thoracic surgery, geology, or quantum mechanic all the same, without being a expert in the field. Which is in part why i thought this could work for me, and being an artist, having a sponsor could really change things. \n\nBut I\u2019m not the prettiest girl around. I\u2019m not bad looking, but far from a super model. I\u2019m curvy (not unlike you, most of it is hips and butt), and I\u2019m now 36 (though people keep telling me I look no more than in my 20\u2019s). And like a lot of intellectuals, I can be a little clumsily socially at time and a bit shy. So all those girl showing perfect os\u00e9e pictures of models in their early 20\u2019s at most, it really intimidated me out of it. \n\nBut times are changing and I\u2019m considering this more and more, only now, at my age, I\u2019ve started to ask myself if it\u2019s not too late. \n\nSo seeing this post really open my eyes. I\u2019ve heard some negative comments in the past. I\u2019m seen and interview of a curvy sugar baby once that spoke of how curvy and fat babies had to lower their standard and suck those d**k to get the money and to not ask or expect too much of their daddies other than money, and it sounded more like prostitution than anything else. And I\u2019d like to get more than just money. Not necessarily love, but at least be able to develop some level of connection and have a good time. This Reddit has sown me a lot of good examples of sugaring though, for which I\u2019m very appreciative. I\u2019ve learned a lot. Thanks to everyone.",

Any experienced woman would run from a guy who \u201cjust wants to see what\u2019s out there\u201d or \u201cjust bored and want to check this out\u201d or \u201cwant to meet friends.\u201d No. That is not what this site is for. \n\nGiving some indication about what you\u2019re looking for \u201cfwb, weekly meets or a few times a month, ppm to start but happy to go monthly for the right girl\u201d is def helpful. I do also look for sincerity and stay away from guys who are like, \u201cI\u2019ve had A LOT of success in my day\u201d and are extremely insistent about their wealth. \n\nHope that helps.

It all starts with the M&G.  I'll get a few terms & conditions out of the way prior to that, but, as they say, you know within 2 minutes whether you want to move forward or not.\n\nI also get right to the nature of an arrangement...moving on.  It sounds weird, but one topic I cover at the M&G is the ending.  I make it clear that I'm not looking for the future Mrs.  Like all my previous SRs, this too will end.\n\nBTW, my SB just turned 49.

Men who don\u2019t respect boundaries, or constantly ask you to compromise and don\u2019t abide by their commitments, are a red flag. There is a ton of gray of course but as long as the basic parameters are well communicated, you can have a pretty good idea of what should be the \u201cstraw that breaks the camel\u2019s back\u201d for you.\n- the m&g is extremely, extremely important. I\u2019m very very private and never disclose what I want $ for, I usually say to help pay rent, but always express that I appreciate the support. I usually explain single bf I\u2019ve ever had has supported me has supported me in some way, because it\u2019s true. I\u2019ve had SDs pay my tuition, my rent, etc, for years and years. Expressions of appreciation are really appreciated by SDs.\n\nAnd lastly, most importantly- NOTHING IS PERSONAL. If he dumped you- that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not personal. He didn\u2019t want to see you after M&G- not personal: I feel like that\u2019s what an arrangement buys you- a level of impersonality that you should not interpret to be any fault of yours.",

Actually, I\u2019ve always connected better with men older than me and professionals. I\u2019m considered fairly intelligent in the 100th percentile and thus is more attracted to those who use their head. But I never had tons of education because I couldn\u2019t afford it. But I love talking about anything and could enjoy a conversation about stock exchange, cardio thoracic surgery, geology, or quantum mechanic all the same, without being a expert in the field. Which is in part why i thought this could work for me, and being an artist, having a sponsor could really change things. \n\nBut I\u2019m not the prettiest girl around. I\u2019m not bad looking, but far from a super model. I\u2019m curvy (not unlike you, most of it is hips and butt), and I\u2019m now 36 (though people keep telling me I look no more than in my 20\u2019s). And like a lot of intellectuals, I can be a little clumsily socially at time and a bit shy. So all those girl showing perfect os\u00e9e pictures of models in their early 20\u2019s at most, it really intimidated me out of it. \n\nBut times are changing and I\u2019m considering this more and more, only now, at my age, I\u2019ve started to ask myself if it\u2019s not too late. \n\nSo seeing this post really open my eyes. I\u2019ve heard some negative comments in the past. I\u2019m seen and interview of a curvy sugar baby once that spoke of how curvy and fat babies had to lower their standard and suck those d**k to get the money and to not ask or expect too much of their daddies other than money, and it sounded more like prostitution than anything else. And I\u2019d like to get more than just money. Not necessarily love, but at least be able to develop some level of connection and have a good time. This Reddit has sown me a lot of good examples of sugaring though, for which I\u2019m very appreciative. I\u2019ve learned a lot. Thanks to everyone.",

Respect each other\u2019s parameters. And If you have issues with that it\u2019s time to cut it off.\n-if your instincts tell you it\u2019s a bad idea, it\u2019s a bad idea. Men who don\u2019t respect boundaries, or constantly ask you to compromise and don\u2019t abide by their commitments, are a red flag. There is a ton of gray of course but as long as the basic parameters are well communicated, you can have a pretty good idea of what should be the \u201cstraw that breaks the camel\u2019s back\u201d for you.\n- the m&g is extremely, extremely important. I\u2019m very very private and never disclose what I want $ for, I usually say to help pay rent, but always express that I appreciate the support. I usually explain single bf I\u2019ve ever had has supported me has supported me in some way, because it\u2019s true. I\u2019ve had SDs pay my tuition, my rent, etc, for years and years. Expressions of appreciation are really appreciated by SDs.\n\nAnd lastly, most importantly- NOTHING IS PERSONAL. If he dumped you- that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not personal. He didn\u2019t want to see you after M&G- not personal: I feel like that\u2019s what an arrangement buys you- a level of impersonality that you should not interpret to be any fault of yours.",
