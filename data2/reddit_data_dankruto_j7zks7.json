He was the guy who always called people by (endearing) annoying nicknames, like ero-sennin, obaa-chan, jii-chan, aloe vera, etc. But when his son does the same he freaks out and acts all serious. Not to mention the fact that he tells Sarada all those things about him being the best and Boruto that he never threw tantrums when he was his age. It\u2019s funny one or twice, but when they do this repeatedly it seems like Naruto has no self awareness which bums me out.\n\nFor the record, for a long time he was my favorite character in the show, after getting replaced by Kakashi ofc, but he still is one of my faves.",
