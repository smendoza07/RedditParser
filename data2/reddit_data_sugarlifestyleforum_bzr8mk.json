    "body": "I had a  m&g last week with a very domineering and misogynistic man who was pretty good at making himself appear otherwise. When I told him that I needed at least some form of ppm before I joined him at his house he launched into a rant about \u201cnot buying a time share in Maui if I haven\u2019t ever been to the island.\u201d \nI wished him well and he came back with it being too much about money/ he wasn\u2019t an atm and that wasn\u2019t how he worked- so typical, AND about how he thought I was really immature. \n\nHe said something like \u201cI deal with professionals all day at work and you, my dear, are an amateur.\u201d\n\nAs well as\n\n\u201cFrankly, it was a huge red flag this morning when you decided it was more important to run mundane errands than to spend 2 hours in the woods with me. As I said last evening...people do what they want to do. You demonstrated to me where I fit on your hierarchy of importance which grew my concerns.\u201d \n\nAll because I choose to finish a paper and go running rather than hang out behind his house in the friggin woods \n\nLMAO\n\nSo last night I get a message from him on another sugar site asking if I would reconsider. Silly silly boy. I\u2019ve met you ONE time and you\u2019ve already lost your darn marbles. \n\nAnyone else have stories about POTs who keep coming back?",

My point is that you\u2019ve said we\u2019re much safer now and I disproved that, betraying your original point. Sounds a lot like \u201cyou should be okay with the abuses women suffer today, you should be grateful you aren\u2019t in the 60s when you would\u2019ve been treated even worse despite the present day abuses still being abhorrent!\u201d.

My point is that you\u2019ve said we\u2019re much safer now and I disproved that, betraying your original point. Sounds a lot like \u201cyou should be okay with the abuses women suffer today, you should be grateful you aren\u2019t in the 60s when you would\u2019ve been treated even worse despite the present day abuses still being abhorrent!\u201d. Seems like you\u2019re being obtuse on purpose and purposely missing the point so hey, thanks for proving me right.",

Because of cell phone use since the 90s going up. Not to mention by almost every statistic all crimes but property and rape (they changed the way it was defined) have been going down for years.

You think the black girl who was raped in the 60s got any attention or even a police report filed in Alabama back then? Come on.",
