Shakamaru's raw words while standing over the hole in whoch he buried hidan.

That was the most satisfying scene in the entire series for me",

Not trying to start a flamewar, but supporters of One piece usually say Naruto is only better at fights, while One piece is better at everything else, but I don't agree. The reason is that flashbacks and character development both come into play during fights, and these three elements intermingle well to strengthen each other. For example, Lee vs Gaara, before he opened the eight gates, we got to see his flashback and root for him even more, and his flashback in itself was just so relatable and emotional. Another is Naruto vs Sasuke at FV in Part I, where Sasuke's full backstory with Itachi and their parents is revealed during the fight where we see Sasuke ramp up in hate and drive more and more, but culminates in Sasuke choosing to not kill Naruto to go against Itachi's path. And yet another one that I think is perhaps a little controversial is Kabuto in his fight against the brothers, where his very backstory and personality affects every move he makes in the battle, as well as how Itachi neutralizes him.",

If it didn\u2019t have filler, the story\u2019d feel bland and be similar to just reading the plot of a wiki. Here\u2019s another way to view it. Think of the plot as a molder or a cup such that it\u2019s topography sets its plot unique to other stories, and think of all the gags, fight choreography, character designs and unique moments, repeated actions (for dramatic effects), background details of what\u2019s going on like details specific to the location like random people going about their business in the lead village as a liquid set to solidify. That liquid is technically filler. Filler is basically all the elements that enrich a story and is basically is the stuff that If removed doesn\u2019t change the story\u2019s plot. The overall story is the shape of the solidified object when removed from the cup. If there\u2019s too much of it, it overflows and when solidified, it harms the shape of it. If there\u2019s too little, the story feels rather empty and it feels too rushed. \n\nFiller is only bad if it\u2019s  uninteresting or dilutes and stretches the story that the pacing is harmed by it. Even anime filler isn\u2019t bad as it can help stall the anime so it doesn\u2019t catch up with the manga while keeping the audience engaged. But that\u2019s only if it\u2019s done right. One example of it done wrong is Narutos anime filler is 90% just standard, plain and boring to watch and that can be a real drain to watch. And one that\u2019s done right is Gintama recap episodes which are hilarious and interesting.",

There is nothing of any significant importance in the manga of naruto that is filler. It\u2019s all pretty much necessary to the story. The fact that you think THE BACKGROUND is filler tells me you are stretching up definition to fit your opinion. Most mangas are completely void of filler if it\u2019s episodic! Besides which, filler is literally the definition of anime episodes not in the manga \n\n\u201c\u201cFiller\u201d refers to a story in an Anime that was not in the Manga. These are created as a result of Anime production sometimes outpaces the Manga.

The anime adds other flashbacks on top of the manga one, making such flashback instances last like 3-5 minutes.\n\nHere's an example of a repeated Obito flashback. Episode 379 around 16:50 - 17:30 there is a 40s flashback. Since each 20-page chapter is 10 minutes in the anime, that should be 1 page of a chapter. But in the chapter it's just [ONE PANEL](https://gyazo.com/852fec4646a441000daf1c8e151e735d), not even HALF a page.\n\nSo again, we really should make a repeated flashback guide with timestamps!",

And then we did get Gai who in many regards was similar to Lee, except that Gai's backstory could've been a bit more compelling. \n\nMy main point however is that these new flashbacks (not repeated flashbacks) do become relevant in the very same fights they appear in, and have the consequences and emotional effect I listed in my previous comment.",

He infiltrated the 5 kage summit just to kill danzo and had no interest in going up against the rest of the 4 kage, it was just them who attacked him first so he was mainly attacking them to weaken them/kill them fast enough to get to danzo\n\ni remember when he approached the meeting room,had an intense eye contact with danzo and then tried to go after him but mei sealed the room with her lava style and then sasuke told her not to interfere. he probably wasnt expecting to be attacked by literally everyone in the room at the same time lol which is why i consider it impressive that he was able to survive for that long even if u consider some of the moments \"plot armour\"",

Naruto almost died alot of times during the pain fight and had to have hinata step in to be the catalyst to his nine tails transformation, the only reason he survived was bc they brought back his father's soul who somehow also cured the burns on naruto's skin bc of the nine tails and replenished his chakra. Not to mention how nagato was already significantly weakend by his village rampage n shinra tensei which destroyed the village.\n\nThe entirety of naruto series fights r characters struggling against villains and then winning. I dont get why people only get on sasuke's ass bc of that esp when these arguments r easily debunkable",

He dies if zetsu doesn\u2019t save him from being melted by mei. He dies if tobito doesn\u2019t save him from atomization via onoki. \n\nThe entire Danzo fight is an ass pull (in both directions, they both just kept unveiling new jutsu and abilities that they never shown before or had any way of knowing) and Karin saves him. Naruto literally laughs in his face because even Naruto knew that Sasuke wouldn\u2019t learn anything if Naruto beat him then (which he absolutely would have), Tobi once again plays the escape route.\n\nSasuke not only has never won a major fight by himself in the ENTIRE SERIES, the fights he has won have legit all been by massive plot ass pulls (see deidara, bee, danzo) his opponents FEELING SORRY FOR HIM (see Itachi, Naruto) or people pulling his dumb ass out of the Fire time and time again. \n\nHe had energy alright; just like a Chihuahua.",

Not trying to start a flamewar, but supporters of One piece usually say Naruto is only better at fights, while One piece is better at everything else, but I don't agree. The reason is that flashbacks and character development both come into play during fights, and these three elements intermingle well to strengthen each other. For example, Lee vs Gaara, before he opened the eight gates, we got to see his flashback and root for him even more, and his flashback in itself was just so relatable and emotional. Another is Naruto vs Sasuke at FV in Part I, where Sasuke's full backstory with Itachi and their parents is revealed during the fight where we see Sasuke ramp up in hate and drive more and more, but culminates in Sasuke choosing to not kill Naruto to go against Itachi's path. And yet another one that I think is perhaps a little controversial is Kabuto in his fight against the brothers, where his very backstory and personality affects every move he makes in the battle, as well as how Itachi neutralizes him.",

If it didn\u2019t have filler, the story\u2019d feel bland and be similar to just reading the plot of a wiki. Here\u2019s another way to view it. Think of the plot as a molder or a cup such that it\u2019s topography sets its plot unique to other stories, and think of all the gags, fight choreography, character designs and unique moments, repeated actions (for dramatic effects), background details of what\u2019s going on like details specific to the location like random people going about their business in the lead village as a liquid set to solidify. That liquid is technically filler. Filler is basically all the elements that enrich a story and is basically is the stuff that If removed doesn\u2019t change the story\u2019s plot. The overall story is the shape of the solidified object when removed from the cup. If there\u2019s too much of it, it overflows and when solidified, it harms the shape of it. If there\u2019s too little, the story feels rather empty and it feels too rushed. \n\nFiller is only bad if it\u2019s  uninteresting or dilutes and stretches the story that the pacing is harmed by it. Even anime filler isn\u2019t bad as it can help stall the anime so it doesn\u2019t catch up with the manga while keeping the audience engaged. But that\u2019s only if it\u2019s done right. One example of it done wrong is Narutos anime filler is 90% just standard, plain and boring to watch and that can be a real drain to watch. And one that\u2019s done right is Gintama recap episodes which are hilarious and interesting.",

However, I just think that perhaps people are having a bit of a kneejerk reaction in opposition to Naruto because One piece was undeservedly hated before. The online discourse between these two has never been balanced, but it just shifted from one extreme to another.",

The anime adds other flashbacks on top of the manga one, making such flashback instances last like 3-5 minutes.\n\nHere's an example of a repeated Obito flashback. Episode 379 around 16:50 - 17:30 there is a 40s flashback. Since each 20-page chapter is 10 minutes in the anime, that should be 1 page of a chapter. But in the chapter it's just [ONE PANEL](https://gyazo.com/852fec4646a441000daf1c8e151e735d), not even HALF a page.\n\nSo again, we really should make a repeated flashback guide with timestamps!",

And then we did get Gai who in many regards was similar to Lee, except that Gai's backstory could've been a bit more compelling. \n\nMy main point however is that these new flashbacks (not repeated flashbacks) do become relevant in the very same fights they appear in, and have the consequences and emotional effect I listed in my previous comment.",

Not to mention how nagato was already significantly weakend by his village rampage n shinra tensei which destroyed the village.\n\nThe entirety of naruto series fights r characters struggling against villains and then winning. I dont get why people only get on sasuke's ass bc of that esp when these arguments r easily debunkable",

Not trying to start a flamewar, but supporters of One piece usually say Naruto is only better at fights, while One piece is better at everything else, but I don't agree. The reason is that flashbacks and character development both come into play during fights, and these three elements intermingle well to strengthen each other. For example, Lee vs Gaara, before he opened the eight gates, we got to see his flashback and root for him even more, and his flashback in itself was just so relatable and emotional. Another is Naruto vs Sasuke at FV in Part I, where Sasuke's full backstory with Itachi and their parents is revealed during the fight where we see Sasuke ramp up in hate and drive more and more, but culminates in Sasuke choosing to not kill Naruto to go against Itachi's path. And yet another one that I think is perhaps a little controversial is Kabuto in his fight against the brothers, where his very backstory and personality affects every move he makes in the battle, as well as how Itachi neutralizes him.",

If it didn\u2019t have filler, the story\u2019d feel bland and be similar to just reading the plot of a wiki. Here\u2019s another way to view it. Think of the plot as a molder or a cup such that it\u2019s topography sets its plot unique to other stories, and think of all the gags, fight choreography, character designs and unique moments, repeated actions (for dramatic effects), background details of what\u2019s going on like details specific to the location like random people going about their business in the lead village as a liquid set to solidify. That liquid is technically filler. Filler is basically all the elements that enrich a story and is basically is the stuff that If removed doesn\u2019t change the story\u2019s plot. The overall story is the shape of the solidified object when removed from the cup. If there\u2019s too much of it, it overflows and when solidified, it harms the shape of it. If there\u2019s too little, the story feels rather empty and it feels too rushed. \n\nFiller is only bad if it\u2019s  uninteresting or dilutes and stretches the story that the pacing is harmed by it. Even anime filler isn\u2019t bad as it can help stall the anime so it doesn\u2019t catch up with the manga while keeping the audience engaged. But that\u2019s only if it\u2019s done right. One example of it done wrong is Narutos anime filler is 90% just standard, plain and boring to watch and that can be a real drain to watch. And one that\u2019s done right is Gintama recap episodes which are hilarious and interesting.",

While One piece is a manga for all ages, It has very dark themes and instances while also being extremely light hearted. It also has an extremely wide amount of themes and tones like Punk Hazards Addiction theme or Morias depression and ptsd and how it lead to him becoming a literal shadow of himself. One Piece is basically an All in one manga with everything amazing to offer for all ages.",

The online discourse between these two has never been balanced, but it just shifted from one extreme to another.",

The anime adds other flashbacks on top of the manga one, making such flashback instances last like 3-5 minutes.\n\nHere's an example of a repeated Obito flashback. Episode 379 around 16:50 - 17:30 there is a 40s flashback. Since each 20-page chapter is 10 minutes in the anime, that should be 1 page of a chapter. But in the chapter it's just [ONE PANEL](https://gyazo.com/852fec4646a441000daf1c8e151e735d), not even HALF a page.\n\nSo again, we really should make a repeated flashback guide with timestamps!",

And then we did get Gai who in many regards was similar to Lee, except that Gai's backstory could've been a bit more compelling. \n\nMy main point however is that these new flashbacks (not repeated flashbacks) do become relevant in the very same fights they appear in, and have the consequences and emotional effect I listed in my previous comment.",

If it didn\u2019t have filler, the story\u2019d feel bland and be similar to just reading the plot of a wiki. Here\u2019s another way to view it. Think of the plot as a molder or a cup such that it\u2019s topography sets its plot unique to other stories, and think of all the gags, fight choreography, character designs and unique moments, repeated actions (for dramatic effects), background details of what\u2019s going on like details specific to the location like random people going about their business in the lead village as a liquid set to solidify. That liquid is technically filler. Filler is basically all the elements that enrich a story and is basically is the stuff that If removed doesn\u2019t change the story\u2019s plot. The overall story is the shape of the solidified object when removed from the cup. If there\u2019s too much of it, it overflows and when solidified, it harms the shape of it. If there\u2019s too little, the story feels rather empty and it feels too rushed. \n\nFiller is only bad if it\u2019s  uninteresting or dilutes and stretches the story that the pacing is harmed by it. Even anime filler isn\u2019t bad as it can help stall the anime so it doesn\u2019t catch up with the manga while keeping the audience engaged. But that\u2019s only if it\u2019s done right. One example of it done wrong is Narutos anime filler is 90% just standard, plain and boring to watch and that can be a real drain to watch. And one that\u2019s done right is Gintama recap episodes which are hilarious and interesting.",

The anime adds other flashbacks on top of the manga one, making such flashback instances last like 3-5 minutes.\n\nHere's an example of a repeated Obito flashback. Episode 379 around 16:50 - 17:30 there is a 40s flashback. Since each 20-page chapter is 10 minutes in the anime, that should be 1 page of a chapter. But in the chapter it's just [ONE PANEL](https://gyazo.com/852fec4646a441000daf1c8e151e735d), not even HALF a page.\n\nSo again, we really should make a repeated flashback guide with timestamps!",

If it didn\u2019t have filler, the story\u2019d feel bland and be similar to just reading the plot of a wiki. Here\u2019s another way to view it. Think of the plot as a molder or a cup such that it\u2019s topography sets its plot unique to other stories, and think of all the gags, fight choreography, character designs and unique moments, repeated actions (for dramatic effects), background details of what\u2019s going on like details specific to the location like random people going about their business in the lead village as a liquid set to solidify. That liquid is technically filler. Filler is basically all the elements that enrich a story and is basically is the stuff that If removed doesn\u2019t change the story\u2019s plot. The overall story is the shape of the solidified object when removed from the cup. If there\u2019s too much of it, it overflows and when solidified, it harms the shape of it. If there\u2019s too little, the story feels rather empty and it feels too rushed. \n\nFiller is only bad if it\u2019s  uninteresting or dilutes and stretches the story that the pacing is harmed by it. Even anime filler isn\u2019t bad as it can help stall the anime so it doesn\u2019t catch up with the manga while keeping the audience engaged. But that\u2019s only if it\u2019s done right. One example of it done wrong is Narutos anime filler is 90% just standard, plain and boring to watch and that can be a real drain to watch. And one that\u2019s done right is Gintama recap episodes which are hilarious and interesting.",

The anime adds other flashbacks on top of the manga one, making such flashback instances last like 3-5 minutes.\n\nHere's an example of a repeated Obito flashback. Episode 379 around 16:50 - 17:30 there is a 40s flashback. Since each 20-page chapter is 10 minutes in the anime, that should be 1 page of a chapter. But in the chapter it's just [ONE PANEL](https://gyazo.com/852fec4646a441000daf1c8e151e735d), not even HALF a page.\n\nSo again, we really should make a repeated flashback guide with timestamps!",

Even S Rank ninja like Zabuza only used a hidden mist, water prison, and water dragon jutsu in a fight. \n\nLike it's one thing to accept that Kishimoto simply changed how chakra limits work as he continued his story, but I'm shocked to hear that you in all honesty think Sasuke's part 2 chakra levels make sense within the world building of part 1.",

If it didn\u2019t have filler, the story\u2019d feel bland and be similar to just reading the plot of a wiki. Here\u2019s another way to view it. Think of the plot as a molder or a cup such that it\u2019s topography sets its plot unique to other stories, and think of all the gags, fight choreography, character designs and unique moments, repeated actions (for dramatic effects), background details of what\u2019s going on like details specific to the location like random people going about their business in the lead village as a liquid set to solidify. That liquid is technically filler. Filler is basically all the elements that enrich a story and is basically is the stuff that If removed doesn\u2019t change the story\u2019s plot. The overall story is the shape of the solidified object when removed from the cup. If there\u2019s too much of it, it overflows and when solidified, it harms the shape of it. If there\u2019s too little, the story feels rather empty and it feels too rushed. \n\nFiller is only bad if it\u2019s  uninteresting or dilutes and stretches the story that the pacing is harmed by it. Even anime filler isn\u2019t bad as it can help stall the anime so it doesn\u2019t catch up with the manga while keeping the audience engaged. But that\u2019s only if it\u2019s done right. One example of it done wrong is Narutos anime filler is 90% just standard, plain and boring to watch and that can be a real drain to watch. And one that\u2019s done right is Gintama recap episodes which are hilarious and interesting.",

The anime adds other flashbacks on top of the manga one, making such flashback instances last like 3-5 minutes.\n\nHere's an example of a repeated Obito flashback. Episode 379 around 16:50 - 17:30 there is a 40s flashback. Since each 20-page chapter is 10 minutes in the anime, that should be 1 page of a chapter. But in the chapter it's just [ONE PANEL](https://gyazo.com/852fec4646a441000daf1c8e151e735d), not even HALF a page.\n\nSo again, we really should make a repeated flashback guide with timestamps!",

If it didn\u2019t have filler, the story\u2019d feel bland and be similar to just reading the plot of a wiki. Here\u2019s another way to view it. Think of the plot as a molder or a cup such that it\u2019s topography sets its plot unique to other stories, and think of all the gags, fight choreography, character designs and unique moments, repeated actions (for dramatic effects), background details of what\u2019s going on like details specific to the location like random people going about their business in the lead village as a liquid set to solidify. That liquid is technically filler. Filler is basically all the elements that enrich a story and is basically is the stuff that If removed doesn\u2019t change the story\u2019s plot. The overall story is the shape of the solidified object when removed from the cup. If there\u2019s too much of it, it overflows and when solidified, it harms the shape of it. If there\u2019s too little, the story feels rather empty and it feels too rushed. \n\nFiller is only bad if it\u2019s  uninteresting or dilutes and stretches the story that the pacing is harmed by it. Even anime filler isn\u2019t bad as it can help stall the anime so it doesn\u2019t catch up with the manga while keeping the audience engaged. But that\u2019s only if it\u2019s done right. One example of it done wrong is Narutos anime filler is 90% just standard, plain and boring to watch and that can be a real drain to watch. And one that\u2019s done right is Gintama recap episodes which are hilarious and interesting.",

There is nothing of any significant importance in the manga of naruto that is filler. It\u2019s all pretty much necessary to the story. The fact that you think THE BACKGROUND is filler tells me you are stretching up definition to fit your opinion. Most mangas are completely void of filler if it\u2019s episodic! Besides which, filler is literally the definition of anime episodes not in the manga \n\n\u201c\u201cFiller\u201d refers to a story in an Anime that was not in the Manga. These are created as a result of Anime production sometimes outpaces the Manga. Fillers don't continue the story and are typically both visually and narratively of lower quality.\u201d - https://simkl.org/naruto-filler-list-and-filler-guides-for-all-other-anime-8a06eeec092\n\nYou\u2019re just plain wrong, there is no filler in the naruto manga\n\nEdit: anything that adds to the story is story material, filler takes away or deviates from the main story",

The anime adds other flashbacks on top of the manga one, making such flashback instances last like 3-5 minutes.\n\nHere's an example of a repeated Obito flashback. Episode 379 around 16:50 - 17:30 there is a 40s flashback. Since each 20-page chapter is 10 minutes in the anime, that should be 1 page of a chapter. But in the chapter it's just [ONE PANEL](https://gyazo.com/852fec4646a441000daf1c8e151e735d), not even HALF a page.\n\nSo again, we really should make a repeated flashback guide with timestamps!",

If it didn\u2019t have filler, the story\u2019d feel bland and be similar to just reading the plot of a wiki. Here\u2019s another way to view it. Think of the plot as a molder or a cup such that it\u2019s topography sets its plot unique to other stories, and think of all the gags, fight choreography, character designs and unique moments, repeated actions (for dramatic effects), background details of what\u2019s going on like details specific to the location like random people going about their business in the lead village as a liquid set to solidify. That liquid is technically filler. Filler is basically all the elements that enrich a story and is basically is the stuff that If removed doesn\u2019t change the story\u2019s plot. The overall story is the shape of the solidified object when removed from the cup. If there\u2019s too much of it, it overflows and when solidified, it harms the shape of it. If there\u2019s too little, the story feels rather empty and it feels too rushed. \n\nFiller is only bad if it\u2019s  uninteresting or dilutes and stretches the story that the pacing is harmed by it. Even anime filler isn\u2019t bad as it can help stall the anime so it doesn\u2019t catch up with the manga while keeping the audience engaged. But that\u2019s only if it\u2019s done right. One example of it done wrong is Narutos anime filler is 90% just standard, plain and boring to watch and that can be a real drain to watch. And one that\u2019s done right is Gintama recap episodes which are hilarious and interesting.",

There is nothing of any significant importance in the manga of naruto that is filler. It\u2019s all pretty much necessary to the story. The fact that you think THE BACKGROUND is filler tells me you are stretching up definition to fit your opinion. Most mangas are completely void of filler if it\u2019s episodic! Besides which, filler is literally the definition of anime episodes not in the manga \n\n\u201c\u201cFiller\u201d refers to a story in an Anime that was not in the Manga. These are created as a result of Anime production sometimes outpaces the Manga. Fillers don't continue the story and are typically both visually and narratively of lower quality.\u201d - https://simkl.org/naruto-filler-list-and-filler-guides-for-all-other-anime-8a06eeec092\n\nYou\u2019re just plain wrong, there is no filler in the naruto manga\n\nEdit: anything that adds to the story is story material, filler takes away or deviates from the main story",
