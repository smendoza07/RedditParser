Naruto is very emotional and focused on human relationships, so if you actually take it seriously it\u2019s a very deep and touching story. On the other hand it is indeed kinda cliche, and many people didn\u2019t take it as seriously as the show intended to be taken and kinda watched it as just a show with some okay moments.\n\nI myself took naruto\u2019s story extremely seriously and it was just great, but i don\u2019t find fault if someone watches it as a meme, i kinda get that point of view as well",

The anime is an utter clusterfuck because of the pacing. It gets better, but it takes time. I wouldn't fault anyone who says they dropped One Piece because of its artwork. The manga deserves praise though, but so does Naruto.",

After the battle, we\u2019re supposed to get the notion that he won against Neji by defying his idea that everyone is destined to be something, and Naruto was destined to be a failure. Neji was wrong that Naruto was destined to be a failure, but the fight proved him right that people have set destinies in a way. Naruto only defeated Neji after unleashing his nine-tails chakra, which he\u2019s has since birth. In the beginning of the series, Kishimoto made a huge mistake by allowing Naruto to use forbidden jutsu, especially something as broken as the multi-shadow clone just. Now, Naruto is very skilled with the jutsu at some parts, but other times he uses it very well in order to outmaneuver enemies, so it\u2019s a bit inconsistent. I believe Naruto had always had problems with being \u201cdestined for greatness\u201d, and Shippuden only exacerbated the issue.",

Also its just a better way of watching one piece i mean it doesnt mean that you can\u2019t watch it how you want but pacing matters. Its just the best way to experience a great show  and if you watch the orignal then watch it. The orignal is reaily good until punkhazard i just recomend to switching to it when the time comes to punk hazard and forward other wise it can ruin it for you. i wanted to drop one piece when i got to dressosa i didn\u2019t but i almost did and i don\u2019t want  somone to give up on a dimond in the rough beacus of a small proplem like pacing. One pace doesnt change the show it just takes the repeat animation the 10 sec still frame out of the show \n\nIf you disagree with me just dm me i don\u2019t want to ruin this comment thread",

Although I only started it in 2015, I don't really feel outdated watching an anime from 2000 even though the rest of my friends are busy watching boruto and mha and aot and stuff. I've been watching it ever since, but never switched to boruto cos its just cringe. But yeah, it's got its own cliches like talk no jutsu, sad flashbacks and **PLOT ARMOR, GODDAMN PLOT ARMOR**. Like how sasori got pwned for literally no reason whenever he came \\*this close to killing sakura and chiyo. He deserved better. Also, how did Neji survive his flesh wounds, how did the sand dudes come outta nowhere in the sasuke recovery mission, how did naruto just awaken his nine tail stuff for no reason? \n\nThere are also several illogical stuff in naruto, like how did itachi get entirely forgiven for committing literal genocide, including his parents! I know he did that for the greater good but still, what he did was not so different from what Kars did to his pillar man tribe. Now dont say im a hater, I love Itachi but some of his actions are kinda illogical, for example maybe he can spare his parents but no. Also traumatizing his brother? I liked Itachi and will always love him but I feel a bit different now that I learned more about him.",

Same with kabuto, he revived the dead akatsuki members and impostored around in the leaf village for years but everybody just forgot that and he somehow ended up being some orphanage worker? Stupid.

After the battle, we\u2019re supposed to get the notion that he won against Neji by defying his idea that everyone is destined to be something, and Naruto was destined to be a failure. Neji was wrong that Naruto was destined to be a failure, but the fight proved him right that people have set destinies in a way. Naruto only defeated Neji after unleashing his nine-tails chakra, which he\u2019s has since birth. In the beginning of the series, Kishimoto made a huge mistake by allowing Naruto to use forbidden jutsu, especially something as broken as the multi-shadow clone just. Now, Naruto is very skilled with the jutsu at some parts, but other times he uses it very well in order to outmaneuver enemies, so it\u2019s a bit inconsistent. I believe Naruto had always had problems with being \u201cdestined for greatness\u201d, and Shippuden only exacerbated the issue.",

Also its just a better way of watching one piece i mean it doesnt mean that you can\u2019t watch it how you want but pacing matters. Its just the best way to experience a great show  and if you watch the orignal then watch it. The orignal is reaily good until punkhazard i just recomend to switching to it when the time comes to punk hazard and forward other wise it can ruin it for you. i wanted to drop one piece when i got to dressosa i didn\u2019t but i almost did and i don\u2019t want  somone to give up on a dimond in the rough beacus of a small proplem like pacing. One pace doesnt change the show it just takes the repeat animation the 10 sec still frame out of the show \n\nIf you disagree with me just dm me i don\u2019t want to ruin this comment thread",

Same with kabuto, he revived the dead akatsuki members and impostored around in the leaf village for years but everybody just forgot that and he somehow ended up being some orphanage worker? Stupid.

After the battle, we\u2019re supposed to get the notion that he won against Neji by defying his idea that everyone is destined to be something, and Naruto was destined to be a failure. Neji was wrong that Naruto was destined to be a failure, but the fight proved him right that people have set destinies in a way. Naruto only defeated Neji after unleashing his nine-tails chakra, which he\u2019s has since birth. In the beginning of the series, Kishimoto made a huge mistake by allowing Naruto to use forbidden jutsu, especially something as broken as the multi-shadow clone just. Now, Naruto is very skilled with the jutsu at some parts, but other times he uses it very well in order to outmaneuver enemies, so it\u2019s a bit inconsistent. I believe Naruto had always had problems with being \u201cdestined for greatness\u201d, and Shippuden only exacerbated the issue.",

Also its just a better way of watching one piece i mean it doesnt mean that you can\u2019t watch it how you want but pacing matters. Its just the best way to experience a great show  and if you watch the orignal then watch it. The orignal is reaily good until punkhazard i just recomend to switching to it when the time comes to punk hazard and forward other wise it can ruin it for you. i wanted to drop one piece when i got to dressosa i didn\u2019t but i almost did and i don\u2019t want  somone to give up on a dimond in the rough beacus of a small proplem like pacing. One pace doesnt change the show it just takes the repeat animation the 10 sec still frame out of the show \n\nIf you disagree with me just dm me i don\u2019t want to ruin this comment thread",

Him not killing characters is a different thing. I love One Piece with all my heart but don't like this that most the people who have died in the story never actually died. I don't think anyone in One Piece community like those instances. There are far to many to ignore. Like Pel, that Skypian dad, Mr. 2 in Impel down, that son of Big Mom whom she \"killed\" at the begining. I don't remember any other example but there might be some more.",

After the battle, we\u2019re supposed to get the notion that he won against Neji by defying his idea that everyone is destined to be something, and Naruto was destined to be a failure. Neji was wrong that Naruto was destined to be a failure, but the fight proved him right that people have set destinies in a way. Naruto only defeated Neji after unleashing his nine-tails chakra, which he\u2019s has since birth. In the beginning of the series, Kishimoto made a huge mistake by allowing Naruto to use forbidden jutsu, especially something as broken as the multi-shadow clone just. Now, Naruto is very skilled with the jutsu at some parts, but other times he uses it very well in order to outmaneuver enemies, so it\u2019s a bit inconsistent. I believe Naruto had always had problems with being \u201cdestined for greatness\u201d, and Shippuden only exacerbated the issue.",

Also its just a better way of watching one piece i mean it doesnt mean that you can\u2019t watch it how you want but pacing matters. Its just the best way to experience a great show  and if you watch the orignal then watch it. The orignal is reaily good until punkhazard i just recomend to switching to it when the time comes to punk hazard and forward other wise it can ruin it for you. i wanted to drop one piece when i got to dressosa i didn\u2019t but i almost did and i don\u2019t want  somone to give up on a dimond in the rough beacus of a small proplem like pacing. One pace doesnt change the show it just takes the repeat animation the 10 sec still frame out of the show \n\nIf you disagree with me just dm me i don\u2019t want to ruin this comment thread",

I don't think anyone in One Piece community like those instances. There are far to many to ignore. Like Pel, that Skypian dad, Mr. 2 in Impel down, that son of Big Mom whom she \"killed\" at the begining. I don't remember any other example but there might be some more.",

Also its just a better way of watching one piece i mean it doesnt mean that you can\u2019t watch it how you want but pacing matters. Its just the best way to experience a great show  and if you watch the orignal then watch it. The orignal is reaily good until punkhazard i just recomend to switching to it when the time comes to punk hazard and forward other wise it can ruin it for you. i wanted to drop one piece when i got to dressosa i didn\u2019t but i almost did and i don\u2019t want  somone to give up on a dimond in the rough beacus of a small proplem like pacing. One pace doesnt change the show it just takes the repeat animation the 10 sec still frame out of the show \n\nIf you disagree with me just dm me i don\u2019t want to ruin this comment thread",

I don't think anyone in One Piece community like those instances. There are far to many to ignore. Like Pel, that Skypian dad, Mr. 2 in Impel down, that son of Big Mom whom she \"killed\" at the begining. I don't remember any other example but there might be some more.",

You can actually watch the abridged version as a standalone, and it would make sense, and not only is it better than the original, it is one of the best shows (not best Abridged shows, best shows, *period*). You should watch it, and even if you don't, your reasoning shouldn't be the fact it's related to SAO, because it is waaaaaayyy better.\n\nOr maybe (this is just paranoia), you are one of the creators of SAOA and are pretending not to have watched it so you can hear what the common folk (like me) think about it.

Also its just a better way of watching one piece i mean it doesnt mean that you can\u2019t watch it how you want but pacing matters. Its just the best way to experience a great show  and if you watch the orignal then watch it. The orignal is reaily good until punkhazard i just recomend to switching to it when the time comes to punk hazard and forward other wise it can ruin it for you. i wanted to drop one piece when i got to dressosa i didn\u2019t but i almost did and i don\u2019t want  somone to give up on a dimond in the rough beacus of a small proplem like pacing. One pace doesnt change the show it just takes the repeat animation the 10 sec still frame out of the show \n\nIf you disagree with me just dm me i don\u2019t want to ruin this comment thread",

I don't think anyone in One Piece community like those instances. There are far to many to ignore.

Also its just a better way of watching one piece i mean it doesnt mean that you can\u2019t watch it how you want but pacing matters. Its just the best way to experience a great show  and if you watch the orignal then watch it. The orignal is reaily good until punkhazard i just recomend to switching to it when the time comes to punk hazard and forward other wise it can ruin it for you. i wanted to drop one piece when i got to dressosa i didn\u2019t but i almost did and i don\u2019t want  somone to give up on a dimond in the rough beacus of a small proplem like pacing. One pace doesnt change the show it just takes the repeat animation the 10 sec still frame out of the show \n\nIf you disagree with me just dm me i don\u2019t want to ruin this comment thread",

I don't think anyone in One Piece community like those instances. There are far to many to ignore. Like Pel, that Skypian dad, Mr. 2 in Impel down, that son of Big Mom whom she \"killed\" at the begining. I don't remember any other example but there might be some more.",
