This goes against hashiramas will for the village, but im sure all the other villages started out this way, and the feudal lords ended up giving them more power amongst the villages, and they became so well known, that they ended up as world leaders in charge of most decisions, as seen in the kage summit aswell as the end of shipuden when its the 5 kage that decide Sasukes fate and standing in the 5 nations, and not the feudal lords. But I don't think the 5 kage would have much influence outside of their villages. Like besides the hokage, the 5 kage were confined to their respective villages almost. So they wouldn't have control over the whole nation besides gaara, Naruto, Kakashi (maybe) and the other current kage. Like lady tsunade and the legendary sanin held no power and were hardly known or recognized outside the leaf village, and they were considered on the same tier and notoriety as the hokage",

To become Hokage as seen when Tsunade was in a coma and Danzo was selected, the elders of the village (advisors) and leaders of the country meet together and decide who best fits the position. Naruto undoubtedly best fits the position after shippuden despite only being a genin.\n\nWhat's the point of becoming a Jonin when everyone already knows you're stronger than them you know? It's like an estimate for skill and he had no reason to participate in a Chunin or Jonin exam since he would outdo everyone by a lot.\n\nEdit: Kishimoto even stated that he wanted both Sasuke and Naruto to technically remain genin despite being the strongest shinobi to ever live. Sasuke became a missing-nin at genin level and Naruto went on a 2 year training spree with Jiraya and, after coming back, didn't have time to really do any rank ups till after the war was over.",

This goes against hashiramas will for the village, but im sure all the other villages started out this way, and the feudal lords ended up giving them more power amongst the villages, and they became so well known, that they ended up as world leaders in charge of most decisions, as seen in the kage summit aswell as the end of shipuden when its the 5 kage that decide Sasukes fate and standing in the 5 nations, and not the feudal lords. But I don't think the 5 kage would have much influence outside of their villages. Like besides the hokage, the 5 kage were confined to their respective villages almost. So they wouldn't have control over the whole nation besides gaara, Naruto, Kakashi (maybe) and the other current kage. Like lady tsunade and the legendary sanin held no power and were hardly known or recognized outside the leaf village, and they were considered on the same tier and notoriety as the hokage",

To become Hokage as seen when Tsunade was in a coma and Danzo was selected, the elders of the village (advisors) and leaders of the country meet together and decide who best fits the position. Naruto undoubtedly best fits the position after shippuden despite only being a genin.\n\nWhat's the point of becoming a Jonin when everyone already knows you're stronger than them you know? It's like an estimate for skill and he had no reason to participate in a Chunin or Jonin exam since he would outdo everyone by a lot.\n\nEdit: Kishimoto even stated that he wanted both Sasuke and Naruto to technically remain genin despite being the strongest shinobi to ever live. Sasuke became a missing-nin at genin level and Naruto went on a 2 year training spree with Jiraya and, after coming back, didn't have time to really do any rank ups till after the war was over.",

This goes against hashiramas will for the village, but im sure all the other villages started out this way, and the feudal lords ended up giving them more power amongst the villages, and they became so well known, that they ended up as world leaders in charge of most decisions, as seen in the kage summit aswell as the end of shipuden when its the 5 kage that decide Sasukes fate and standing in the 5 nations, and not the feudal lords. But I don't think the 5 kage would have much influence outside of their villages. Like besides the hokage, the 5 kage were confined to their respective villages almost. So they wouldn't have control over the whole nation besides gaara, Naruto, Kakashi (maybe) and the other current kage. Like lady tsunade and the legendary sanin held no power and were hardly known or recognized outside the leaf village, and they were considered on the same tier and notoriety as the hokage",

To become Hokage as seen when Tsunade was in a coma and Danzo was selected, the elders of the village (advisors) and leaders of the country meet together and decide who best fits the position. Naruto undoubtedly best fits the position after shippuden despite only being a genin.\n\nWhat's the point of becoming a Jonin when everyone already knows you're stronger than them you know? It's like an estimate for skill and he had no reason to participate in a Chunin or Jonin exam since he would outdo everyone by a lot.\n\nEdit: Kishimoto even stated that he wanted both Sasuke and Naruto to technically remain genin despite being the strongest shinobi to ever live. Sasuke became a missing-nin at genin level and Naruto went on a 2 year training spree with Jiraya and, after coming back, didn't have time to really do any rank ups till after the war was over.",

This goes against hashiramas will for the village, but im sure all the other villages started out this way, and the feudal lords ended up giving them more power amongst the villages, and they became so well known, that they ended up as world leaders in charge of most decisions, as seen in the kage summit aswell as the end of shipuden when its the 5 kage that decide Sasukes fate and standing in the 5 nations, and not the feudal lords. But I don't think the 5 kage would have much influence outside of their villages. Like besides the hokage, the 5 kage were confined to their respective villages almost. So they wouldn't have control over the whole nation besides gaara, Naruto, Kakashi (maybe) and the other current kage. Like lady tsunade and the legendary sanin held no power and were hardly known or recognized outside the leaf village, and they were considered on the same tier and notoriety as the hokage",

Naruto undoubtedly best fits the position after shippuden despite only being a genin.\n\nWhat's the point of becoming a Jonin when everyone already knows you're stronger than them you know? It's like an estimate for skill and he had no reason to participate in a Chunin or Jonin exam since he would outdo everyone by a lot.\n\nEdit: Kishimoto even stated that he wanted both Sasuke and Naruto to technically remain genin despite being the strongest shinobi to ever live. Sasuke became a missing-nin at genin level and Naruto went on a 2 year training spree with Jiraya and, after coming back, didn't have time to really do any rank ups till after the war was over.",

This goes against hashiramas will for the village, but im sure all the other villages started out this way, and the feudal lords ended up giving them more power amongst the villages, and they became so well known, that they ended up as world leaders in charge of most decisions, as seen in the kage summit aswell as the end of shipuden when its the 5 kage that decide Sasukes fate and standing in the 5 nations, and not the feudal lords. But I don't think the 5 kage would have much influence outside of their villages. Like besides the hokage, the 5 kage were confined to their respective villages almost. So they wouldn't have control over the whole nation besides gaara, Naruto, Kakashi (maybe) and the other current kage. Like lady tsunade and the legendary sanin held no power and were hardly known or recognized outside the leaf village, and they were considered on the same tier and notoriety as the hokage",
