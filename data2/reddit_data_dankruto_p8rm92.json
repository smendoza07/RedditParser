They also cover Sakura and Sasuke's mission in search of a cure for Naruto's chakra illness. \nAnyway there's no surprise that 90% of the community views their relationship as forced, it was never shown outside the novels.",

And I remember the youtube guy going over Sasuke's inner thoughts, his fears, what he thinks of his wife etc, and it was clear he loved and cared for Sakura, he even made her a wedding ring on one of their missions.\n\nI forgot about the other two novels, one was about Kakashi?

They're even illustrated by Kishi and are both canon. \n\nI don't want to spoil anything, there's plenty of action, it's not just a love story but the emotional aspects are really well written, it shows that even in OG Naruto Sasuke was half in love with Sakura when he left the village and all sorts of things.. \n\nWhat sucks is that they should have animated those, the action and fights are really good. They also cover Sakura and Sasuke's mission in search of a cure for Naruto's chakra illness. \nAnyway there's no surprise that 90% of the community views their relationship as forced, it was never shown outside the novels.",

And I remember the youtube guy going over Sasuke's inner thoughts, his fears, what he thinks of his wife etc, and it was clear he loved and cared for Sakura, he even made her a wedding ring on one of their missions.\n\nI forgot about the other two novels, one was about Kakashi?

They also cover Sakura and Sasuke's mission in search of a cure for Naruto's chakra illness. \nAnyway there's no surprise that 90% of the community views their relationship as forced, it was never shown outside the novels.",

Most fans are anime-only, I doubt that even all manga fans have picked up the novels either. \n\nI found out about those novels through a YouTube channel (Naruto Explained) and the dude there goes in a deep dive over the relationship of the two. And I remember the youtube guy going over Sasuke's inner thoughts, his fears, what he thinks of his wife etc, and it was clear he loved and cared for Sakura, he even made her a wedding ring on one of their missions.\n\nI forgot about the other two novels, one was about Kakashi? I'm not sure what's going on there, I'll have to read and see.",
