    "body": "I\u2019m seeing a few posts with Sbs saying stuff like they aren\u2019t sure they\u2019re pretty enough to be an Sb or their tit size or how much are they worth etc.\n1st off. You are priceless! Time is a precious thing and what we spend it on doing, your looks have nothing to do with that.\nSecondly, you are worth as much as you make yourself. And by that I mean how you carry yourself and present yourself. If you act like trash, turn up to a first date looking like you just woke up and haven\u2019t changed in weeks then do not expect a SD to want to pay you. \nAlthough some SD\u2019s are looking for a hot, classy woman to walk around with, most SD\u2019s are just looking for good company, a break from reality and someone intelligent or maybe even just someone to listen to them! Usually it\u2019s all of those things! \nA girl that turns up on agreed dates and is able to keep in touch and make their SD feel one of a kind and not like an ATM.\n:) You want to be an SB? Great! You\u2019re now an SB. Now go out there and take your first nose dive into the sugar bowl, it\u2019s a hard swim but you\u2019ll get there. ",

You want someone to look past your exterior, you need to do the same. Your fiery passion for him and his interests will turn him on more than some dumb uninterested Barbie doll. Sure, sometimes they just want the pretty face & body but without a personality and desire for his time & attention she won\u2019t get very far. ",

Honestly a lot of guys reading this are mistaking what im saying to be \u201cguys who look for hot girls are assholes\u201d and I promise that\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying at all! I\u2019m saying that every SD is different just as every SB is different. :) And that I think attitude is the most important thing.\n\nA bad attitude hot girl who doesn\u2019t make dates won\u2019t get far for being a waste of time.\n\nA bad attitude rich man who makes girls feel like crap also won\u2019t get far.\nHe might if there\u2019s girls who try to endure it because she really needs the cash but they\u2019d never actually have a connection.",

You simply said some practical advice and alternative ways of thinking that are much healthier and more attractive, in a partner (or anyone). \n\nThe guy I was responding to made it seem like the OP was unrealistically inspirational or not relatable.

Never once did I read here say \u201c looks aren\u2019t important to many guys\u201d\n\nWhat you seen to be missing, is that many women who you (and society) would say are pretty, don\u2019t think they are pretty. In fact, I think OP wrote that based on personal experience. \n\nBut, instead of making any assumptions about the OP, I\u2019ll tell you from my point of view. I have personally felt that I was hideous, that my breasts appear\u201csaggy\u201d because they\u2019re small or that my nose is too big - all things that would intimidate me from entering the Sugar Bowl. But guess what? I get tons of guys (and girls) interested in me. And when I meet people from online, I\u2019m usually told I look better in person than in my photos. \n\nBasically, you read the OP and thought it was BS because you assumed she was saying something like: \u201cUgly people can easily be super successful in the bowl, just because of their good personality\u201d (or something like that, right?)\n\nAnd I read the OP and agreed. Because I think she\u2019s saying something closer to \u201cstop obsessing over the little things you think are wrong with you, confidence, connection, and personality are the main things to keep a SR going. Looks matter at first, because attraction is important. But guys aren\u2019t usually looking for a 10 to use solely as arm candy. In fact, almost every SD would prefer a 7-8 who is fun, genuine in bed, and interesting to talk to\u201d",

If you can only spend 50 bucks per date, don\u2019t worry about it. Youll find sugar babies will reject you but keep that chin high and don\u2019t stop looking. You\u2019ll eventually find the right one who will appreciate what you have to offer.\u2019\n\nI think there\u2019s a few things going on here. One is selection bias. The sbs who chime in here with positive experiences of being a big/unconventional/whatever sb  are more likely to be the few successful ones whereas the vast amount of unattractive sbs who never found a match, givecup, and don\u2019t go to this message board because it\u2019s too painful to think about. Or they read the threads but don\u2019t post.\n\nThe other dynamic is that just based on statistics a few unattractive sbs will get sds, but it\u2019s just based mostly on luck and circumstance. Human behavior and preference do exist on spectrums. A few men really do prefer obese women. But people seem to have this kind of silly habit nowadays of taking the exceptions and making them the main basis on which the new rule is made, which is \u2018everyone is different and has different preferences and characteristics so embrace the diversity of people, and rules about human behavior or sexuality are oppressive and limiting\u2019.

Or a willingness and ability to travel to them.  Or a mutual desire for an emotional connection.  Or a demonstrated and well-articulated need for financial support for a good cause (school, child support, etc.)\n\nFWIW, I\u2019m a solid 6-7 in the looks department, but I have a great personality, I\u2019m smart, kind, attentive, confident, don\u2019t let the haters get me down ((*ahem!*)), and I have plenty of interest.  That interest comes from men who find my profile smart/articulate, upfront/honest, and CONFIDENT.\n\nAnyway, love the post.  You right, girl. \u2764\ufe0f ",

Never once did I read here say \u201c looks aren\u2019t important to many guys\u201d\n\nWhat you seen to be missing, is that many women who you (and society) would say are pretty, don\u2019t think they are pretty. In fact, I think OP wrote that based on personal experience. \n\nBut, instead of making any assumptions about the OP, I\u2019ll tell you from my point of view. I have personally felt that I was hideous, that my breasts appear\u201csaggy\u201d because they\u2019re small or that my nose is too big - all things that would intimidate me from entering the Sugar Bowl. But guess what? I get tons of guys (and girls) interested in me. And when I meet people from online, I\u2019m usually told I look better in person than in my photos. \n\nBasically, you read the OP and thought it was BS because you assumed she was saying something like: \u201cUgly people can easily be super successful in the bowl, just because of their good personality\u201d (or something like that, right?)\n\nAnd I read the OP and agreed. Because I think she\u2019s saying something closer to \u201cstop obsessing over the little things you think are wrong with you, confidence, connection, and personality are the main things to keep a SR going. Looks matter at first, because attraction is important. But guys aren\u2019t usually looking for a 10 to use solely as arm candy. In fact, almost every SD would prefer a 7-8 who is fun, genuine in bed, and interesting to talk to\u201d",

Never once did I read here say \u201c looks aren\u2019t important to many guys\u201d\n\nWhat you seen to be missing, is that many women who you (and society) would say are pretty, don\u2019t think they are pretty. In fact, I think OP wrote that based on personal experience. \n\nBut, instead of making any assumptions about the OP, I\u2019ll tell you from my point of view. I have personally felt that I was hideous, that my breasts appear\u201csaggy\u201d because they\u2019re small or that my nose is too big - all things that would intimidate me from entering the Sugar Bowl. But guess what? I get tons of guys (and girls) interested in me. And when I meet people from online, I\u2019m usually told I look better in person than in my photos. \n\nBasically, you read the OP and thought it was BS because you assumed she was saying something like: \u201cUgly people can easily be super successful in the bowl, just because of their good personality\u201d (or something like that, right?)\n\nAnd I read the OP and agreed. Because I think she\u2019s saying something closer to \u201cstop obsessing over the little things you think are wrong with you, confidence, connection, and personality are the main things to keep a SR going. Looks matter at first, because attraction is important. But guys aren\u2019t usually looking for a 10 to use solely as arm candy. In fact, almost every SD would prefer a 7-8 who is fun, genuine in bed, and interesting to talk to\u201d",

Because you\u2019re right.  There are all sorts of SDs out there.  A lot care about looks first, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that!  But a lot care about intelligence first.  Or a willingness and ability to travel to them.  Or a mutual desire for an emotional connection.  Or a demonstrated and well-articulated need for financial support for a good cause (school, child support, etc.)\n\nFWIW, I\u2019m a solid 6-7 in the looks department, but I have a great personality, I\u2019m smart, kind, attentive, confident, don\u2019t let the haters get me down ((*ahem!*)), and I have plenty of interest.  That interest comes from men who find my profile smart/articulate, upfront/honest, and CONFIDENT.\n\nAnyway, love the post.  You right, girl. \u2764\ufe0f ",

No matter what it is we are doing, we should always take in consideration that people are still people with fragile mental healths :) x\n\nHaha I envy you! I let haters get to me too much.

In fact, I think OP wrote that based on personal experience. \n\nBut, instead of making any assumptions about the OP, I\u2019ll tell you from my point of view. I have personally felt that I was hideous, that my breasts appear\u201csaggy\u201d because they\u2019re small or that my nose is too big - all things that would intimidate me from entering the Sugar Bowl. But guess what? I get tons of guys (and girls) interested in me. And when I meet people from online, I\u2019m usually told I look better in person than in my photos. \n\nBasically, you read the OP and thought it was BS because you assumed she was saying something like: \u201cUgly people can easily be super successful in the bowl, just because of their good personality\u201d (or something like that, right?)\n\nAnd I read the OP and agreed. Because I think she\u2019s saying something closer to \u201cstop obsessing over the little things you think are wrong with you, confidence, connection, and personality are the main things to keep a SR going. Looks matter at first, because attraction is important. But guys aren\u2019t usually looking for a 10 to use solely as arm candy. In fact, almost every SD would prefer a 7-8 who is fun, genuine in bed, and interesting to talk to\u201d",
