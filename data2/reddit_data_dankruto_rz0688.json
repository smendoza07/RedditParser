I honestly don't think the kcm cloak is that much of a boost at this point.\n\n>Madara reacted was barely able to react to it.\n\nWould not call it barely. He had enough time to make the truth seeker orb change into a staff then grab said staff and move it to block naruto. That is definitely a clean reaction. \n\n>He was literally laying on the ground while immobilized and then absorbed the god tree.\n\nI mean i guess you could see it that way. To me it looked like he was chilling until the 10 tails spoke to him.\n\n>Then him and sasuke continue to just shit on a much stronger madara.\n\nIt's not exactly stated or shown how much the god tree buffs someone. Could be minor, could be alot. Plus the most that happened to madara in that scuffle was him being cut in half (looks like I'm making it sound like nothing, but madara really didn't seem to give a shit). And he literally tanked their rasengan and chidori combination, and still substituted a shadow and left it before they could touch him. Maybe he didn't win the skirmish, but he definitely wasn't shat on. Also i definitely remember Naruto getting swatted like a fly in that skirmish.\n\n>Then madara gets his other rinnegan and gets a massive power up again and naruto and sasuke still prove to be about equally as strong or stronger than him individually (naruto clones fight evenly with limbo clones. sasuke fights with him one on one).\n\nWdym \"and a power boost\" do you mean a power up from getting the second rinnegan. And when naruto fights madaras limbo, manga doesn't show any more than one square box of them in fight, but the anime makes naruto sound like he's struggling. At minimum narutos shadow clones are strong enough to not get steam rolled by the limbo, so I'll give him that.  Also what do you mean by sasuke. Sasuke doesn't interact with madara at all after he cuts him in half before madara kamuid.\n\n>I think realistically its a no diff for 6p kcm naruto if its pre god tree madara. That's not really wanking naruto either, that's just the very clear implication that kishimoto wanted to give. Madara needed 2 massive power ups to even fight with them semi evenly before they understand their powers fully.\n\nSo you genuinely think that kishimoto made the main character so much unfathomably stronger than the current antagonist. Does not make sense from a narrative perspective. \n\nThere is atleast 2 examples where naruto heavily implied that he couldn't take madara by himself. \n\nAfter madara gets the god tree he says to naruto that he can't take him down, then naruto goes \"I'm not gonna take you down, we are\"\n\nAnd while madara was in kamui getting his second, he literally says the answer to take madara down was teamwork. \n\nAlso madara had no idea what naruto and sasukes abilities were, so it cancels out. (They literally got 2 freebies on him with sasukes rinnegan) \n\nAlso I don't even think final form madara low diffs pre god tree madara, so i definitely don't naruto does.",

Guy was going for attacks from each side randomly to surprise madara and the orbs were able to keep up for the most part. Naruto attacked head on a madara caught it right before it hit his chest.\n\n>I mean i guess you could see it that way. To me it looked like he was chilling until the 10 tails spoke to him. \n\nI think you should look at that panel again lol. \"Just chilling until the 10 tails spoke to him.\" He was literally scared the tree was falling and didn't move.\n\n>It's not exactly stated or shown how much the god tree buffs someone. Could be minor, could be alot. \n\nMadara literally states \"I'm basically immortal now\" after getting the tree. So its safe to say it was a large boost. We also know that it was sizeable because they say kaguya has more chakra than even another god tree on top madara. Neither of those statements make sense if it was just some mediocre power up.\n\n>Plus the most that happened to madara in that scuffle was him being cut in half (looks like I'm making it sound like nothing, but madara really didn't seem to give a shit). And he literally tanked their rasengan and chidori combination, and still substituted a shadow and left it before they could touch him. Maybe he didn't win the skirmish, but he definitely wasn't shat on. Also i definitely remember Naruto getting swatted like a fly in that skirmish.\n\nMadara gets stabbed through the chest with effortlessly. Literally all of his attacks are dodged or blocked. He replaces himself with limbo to escape and he gets cut in half. They LITERALLY are no diffing him but don't know a way around his healing. I have no idea how you can say he wasn't shit on.\n\n>Wdym \"and a power boost\" do you mean a power up from getting the second rinnegan. And when naruto fights madaras limbo, manga doesn't show any more than one square box of them in fight, but the anime makes naruto sound like he's struggling. At minimum narutos shadow clones are strong enough to not get steam rolled by the limbo, so I'll give him that. Also what do you mean by sasuke. Sasuke doesn't interact with madara at all after he cuts him in half before madara kamuid.\n\nYes his rinnegan lets him summon multiple limbo clones stated to be relative to his strength. In the manga naruto takes them on and isn't shown to be losing. In the anime naruto doesn't seem to be losing either he's just fighting. There's no indication that he is losing the fight in either.\n\n>So you genuinely think that kishimoto made the main character so much unfathomably stronger than the current antagonist. Does not make sense from a narrative perspective.\n\nYes.. and that's not a weird concept either. Another one of the big 3 shounen does it against their big antagonist. Madara literally does not land a hit on them the entire fight while they would have killed anyone without that level of healing multiple times over. Kishimoto was trying to make it VERY clear that madara was nothing compared to them now.\n\n>After madara gets the god tree he says to naruto that he can't take him down, then naruto goes \"I'm not gonna take you down, we are\"\n\nThat does not imply that. That's just him iterating that him an sasuke are a team.\n\n>And while madara was in kamui getting his second, he literally says the answer to take madara down was teamwork\n\nYes because madara is able to fight semi evenly with double rinnegan. He still is clearly losing the fight but with all of his limbo clones and all the meteors he was able to stall them long enough to start the infinite tsukuyomi. The only reason one of them solo could not beat him is because they needed both of them to seal him and they weren't sure how to get around his immortality.\n\nSasuke and naruto don't know his abilities either. They learn about the limbo clones mid fight and still counter them easily.\n\nAnd of course double rinnegan madara low diffs pre god tree. Even if they were the same strength, double rinne madara has like 5 extra limbo clones that are stated to be similar in strength to the actual madara. But madara gets an extra rinnegan and a shit ton of chakra on top of that.\n\nIdk theres no implication that madara can actually fight evenly with them. Throughout the fight the only things they really are worried about is protecting the rest of the forces and actually getting him in a position to seal him. He can't hit them at all",

The only way this can become an argument is if you're trying to say that guys attack in that fight was moving faster than naruto was, which you clearly aren't. \n\nWhen naruto attacked madara, madara reacted to the attack, sent commands to change his truth seeking orbs shape, truth seeking orb changes it's shape (even if you think shape changing part happens instantly, madara still had to make it happen), then grabs it and pushes it into a position to block naruto.

He replaces himself with limbo to escape and he gets cut in half. They LITERALLY are no diffing him but don't know a way around his healing. I have no idea how you can say he wasn't shit on.\n\nLets see, madara launches the lightning style jutsu, naruto blocks it with TSB, naruto tries to attack madara, madara blocks it with limbo, madara uses fang of light, Naruto dodges it then madara hits him with the limbo clone and sends him flying to the floor.\n\nThis is kind of an L for Naruto.\n\nAt this point the edge goes to madara, seeing as how he was the only one to do damage.\n\nThen he tries to take sasukes eye and sasuke switches with the sword and he gets impaled. A bit of an L for madara, but there was literally no way he could see it coming. Plus honestly pre ten tails alive madara Could survive that impalement, even kakashi survived getting impaled by obito in their fight.\n\nAnd then at this point madara just wanted his other eye back.\n\nThen after that naruto and sasuke hit madara with their magnet style rasengan and six paths chidori, because of sasukes rinnegan, madara Could not only not see it coming, he literally couldn't do anything about it. Then he not only tanks their attack, he escapes it (the rasengan was literally made to seal his movements) and substitutes a shadow all before they can put their hands together and touch madara.\n\nBro this is a decently sized L for naruto and sasuke.\n\nThen madara just goes to get his other eye, and sasuke cuts him in half.\n\nA bit of an L for madara, but at this point he literally doesn't give a shit, he knows that sasuke can't kill him.\n\nLets see, 2 Ls for madara, 2 Ls for naruto. I'd say it was about even. Even if team naruto was winning, madara definitely was not getting shit on. If you still disagree, we'll just have to agree to disagree and end the convo. \n\n>Yes his rinnegan lets him summon multiple limbo clones stated to be relative to his strength. In the manga naruto takes them on and isn't shown to be losing. In the anime naruto doesn't seem to be losing either he's just fighting. There's no indication that he is losing the fight in either.\n\nIn the anime naruto sounds kinda annoyed and pissed off. Definitely does sound like he was atleast somewhat struggling.\n\nAnd the manga it doesn't show anyone winning or losing, maybe naruto was stomping the limbo, maybe he was going even. I don't want to make any conclusions, which is just why i gave him the minimum of not being stomped by the limbo which is still a nice feat. (Consider that the limbo are trying to attack the ones on the ground kakashi sakura and the real naruto, and narutos shadow clones are holding them off). \n\n\n>Yes.. and that's not a weird concept either. Another one of the big 3 shounen does it against their big antagonist. Madara literally does not land a hit on them the entire fight while they would have killed anyone without that level of healing multiple times over. Kishimoto was trying to make it VERY clear that madara was nothing compared to them now.\n\nI'm not sure you realise this, but 10 tails and onwards madara literally only lands one nice attack which was on the 4th hokage. After that he does not even land an attack on obito or kakashi or guy ect. Maybe we are reading the same story in a different lense, because I have never gotten the impression ever in my like 5 rewatches/rereads that naruto/sasuke were just leagues of madara.\n\nThe entire theme of the story in the war arc was indra and ashura working together to accomplish great stuff (it's literally written on the stone tablet, among the stuff that black zetsu revised)  The whole greater than the sum of its parts kinda thing. Which is why the sage gave half to naruto and half to sasuke, they needed eachother to beat madara, and I'm not just referring to the healing, the sage literally mentioned how strong madara was getting. \n\nIt wasn't implied to be like \"I've given half my power to the both of you, although naruto you can just go and stomp his ass by yourself\" because if that's how you see it, we really are reading 2 different series. \n\n>And of course double rinnegan madara low diffs pre god tree. Even if they were the same strength, double rinne madara has like 5 extra limbo clones that are stated to be similar in strength to the actual madara. But madara gets an extra rinnegan and a shit ton of chakra on top of that.\n\nI wasn't thinking of the limbo clone extension when i was talking about that, but just real madara vs real madara.",

You misremembered when it happens.\n\nYour whole argument hinges on the basis that narratively naruto shouldn't be stronger. Drop that and look at the actual fight. Madara lands 0 hits throughout multiple large power ups.\n\n\nYour whole argument relies on you misremembering the chapter/episodes and the idea that narratively they should not be much stronger. However, drop that headcanon and actually look at what happens and its clear that they are much stronger than madara individually.\n\nNo hits landed for madara. He's nearly killed by base 6p naruto pre god tree. He is literally chopped in half when he's running for his life. Gets another power up and still can't overpower them. You trying to say \"madara surprised naruto with an attack, that naruto dodged, and pushed naruto away is an big L\" is insanity. Madara literally landed nothing the whole fight and survived due to his hax limbo clones that they hadn't figured out yet.\n\nThis kind of power up is not close to unheard of in anime. Bleach does it, hxh does it, dragon ball does it all the time. Its often a cop out yes, but its well known kishimoto wrote himself into a corner. So he gave naruto and sasuke god like powers to kill the op boss he made.\n\nSo please stop responding with your headcanon and just reread the chapters",

Most of what you said is just incorrect. Narutos lava rasenshuriken renders him immobilized nearly dead on the ground. He's bleeding from his mouth hurt badly laying on his back.\r  \n\r\n\nits one panel of him laying down, how do you even know hes immobilized, and hes bleeding from the mouth from the kick guy did, which you still forget that madara was literally almost dead from guy right when naruto came in, the only visible injury from the rasenshuriken is some sort of tear on his abdomen, you cant see much since its just ripped clothes.\n\nmy argument isnt just narrative. none of the feats suggest that madara is somehow far weaker than naruto and sasuke, none of the little fights they did had madara getting shit on. \n\nmadaras main goal was literally to get his other rinnegan back, that is all, after he escaped naruto and sasukes rasen chidori clash (which he litearlly fully tanked btw) he literally makes a B line straight to kakashis eye to get his rinnegan, lmao he was not running for his life. infact naruto and sasuke straight up fail twice at stopping the infinite tsukiyomi (they didnt stop madara from getting his eye, and they didnt stop him from launching the jutsu).\n\n>You trying to say \"madara surprised naruto with an attack, that naruto dodged, and pushed naruto away is an big L\" is insanity\n\ni didnt say it was a big L for naruto, i just said that at worst it was an even trade.\n\nthe big L was madara tanking and escaping naruto and sasukes rasen chidori clash before they can touch him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand madara doesnt land an attack on guy either, so i guess guy  >>>>>>>>>>>> madara according to you.\n\njust because it makes narrative sense in other arcs of other anime doesnt mean it makes narrative sense in this arc of this series.\n\nyou acknowledge that kishimoto made madara op, but you think kishimotos answer to this is to make naruto and sasuke not only as op as he is (which sure i agree) but far more ( which i disagree ).\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni can do the maths of it, base madara \u2248 kcm2 naruto. so therefore base madara + complete 10 tails and six paths > kcm2 naruto + piece of each tailed beast and six paths.\n\nor i could do it differently, the sage said that madara was getting close to him in power, so madara was about 80% of hagoromo (definetly above 50% otherwise his line wouldnt be relevant), and then the sage gave naruto 50% even if narutos base is some significant % of the sage, he definetly isnt gonna turn into like 200% of the sage.\n\nanyway i look at it, naruto isnt stomping 10 tails madara, not feats wise, not narratively, not even scaling wise. \n\nalso lol what is that link.",

He doesn't use force to break out. His limbo clone is stuck in there and naruto holds them.  \n\n>No the entire fight is madara trying to activate the infinite tsukiyomi, madara says atleast 2 times that he wants his eye back, after sasuke stabs him with the sword using the amenotejikara madara literally says that he needs his other eye (kudos to naruto and sasuke for making him feel that way, but it isn't confirmation that he's getting kurbstomped) then literally every single action he takes from that point is literally just him going to his eye.\n\nRight.... He totally doesn't fight them for a few minutes before running for his life after nearly getting sealed. He goes for his eye because he realizes he needs it to survive.\n\n>You are wanking the hell out of feats that aren't that major. The only feat that even resembles a no diff is sasuke cutting madara in half, but madara was literally immortal and didn't give a shit.\n\n>We are honestly going to have to agree to disagree, we have argued these same points over and over.\n\nNo. I am not.  The rasenshuriken leaves madara on the ground groaning in pain. He only has time to absorb the tree because naruto went to get guy.\n\nThen naruto and sasuke continue to dodge or block literally every single one of his attacks including surprise attacks (fang of light) and the limbo that they didn't know about yet. They stab him through the chest. They catch him in the sealing position and he uses substitution to escape. Then sasuke cuts him in half. Without immortality madara is dead 3 times there and naruto and sasuke don't have a scratch on them and haven't even used the bulk of their abilities. \n\nThere's no room to disagree. Its literally in the panels.  A complete one sided fight from start to finish and naruto and sasuke aren't even remotely worried until kaguya shows up. Where is the mid-high diff coming from if we haven't seen any evidence at all that madara can even hit them with a single attack?\n\nI feel like even you know that you're bullshitting here.

He replaces himself with limbo to escape and he gets cut in half. They LITERALLY are no diffing him but don't know a way around his healing.

In the manga naruto takes them on and isn't shown to be losing. In the anime naruto doesn't seem to be losing either he's just fighting. There's no indication that he is losing the fight in either.\n\n>So you genuinely think that kishimoto made the main character so much unfathomably stronger than the current antagonist.

Madara literally does not land a hit on them the entire fight while they would have killed anyone without that level of healing multiple times over. Kishimoto was trying to make it VERY clear that madara was nothing compared to them now.\n\n>After madara gets the god tree he says to naruto that he can't take him down, then naruto goes \"I'm not gonna take you down, we are\"\n\nThat does not imply that. That's just him iterating that him an sasuke are a team.\n\n>And while madara was in kamui getting his second, he literally says the answer to take madara down was teamwork\n\nYes because madara is able to fight semi evenly with double rinnegan. He still is clearly losing the fight but with all of his limbo clones and all the meteors he was able to stall them long enough to start the infinite tsukuyomi. The only reason one of them solo could not beat him is because they needed both of them to seal him and they weren't sure how to get around his immortality.\n\nSasuke and naruto don't know his abilities either. They learn about the limbo clones mid fight and still counter them easily.\n\nAnd of course double rinnegan madara low diffs pre god tree. Even if they were the same strength, double rinne madara has like 5 extra limbo clones that are stated to be similar in strength to the actual madara. But madara gets an extra rinnegan and a shit ton of chakra on top of that.\n\nIdk theres no implication that madara can actually fight evenly with them. Throughout the fight the only things they really are worried about is protecting the rest of the forces and actually getting him in a position to seal him. He can't hit them at all",

The only way this can become an argument is if you're trying to say that guys attack in that fight was moving faster than naruto was, which you clearly aren't. \n\nWhen naruto attacked madara, madara reacted to the attack, sent commands to change his truth seeking orbs shape, truth seeking orb changes it's shape (even if you think shape changing part happens instantly, madara still had to make it happen), then grabs it and pushes it into a position to block naruto.

He replaces himself with limbo to escape and he gets cut in half. They LITERALLY are no diffing him but don't know a way around his healing. I have no idea how you can say he wasn't shit on.\n\nLets see, madara launches the lightning style jutsu, naruto blocks it with TSB, naruto tries to attack madara, madara blocks it with limbo, madara uses fang of light, Naruto dodges it then madara hits him with the limbo clone and sends him flying to the floor.\n\nThis is kind of an L for Naruto.\n\nAt this point the edge goes to madara, seeing as how he was the only one to do damage.\n\nThen he tries to take sasukes eye and sasuke switches with the sword and he gets impaled. A bit of an L for madara, but there was literally no way he could see it coming. Plus honestly pre ten tails alive madara Could survive that impalement, even kakashi survived getting impaled by obito in their fight.\n\nAnd then at this point madara just wanted his other eye back.\n\nThen after that naruto and sasuke hit madara with their magnet style rasengan and six paths chidori, because of sasukes rinnegan, madara Could not only not see it coming, he literally couldn't do anything about it. Then he not only tanks their attack, he escapes it (the rasengan was literally made to seal his movements) and substitutes a shadow all before they can put their hands together and touch madara.\n\nBro this is a decently sized L for naruto and sasuke.\n\nThen madara just goes to get his other eye, and sasuke cuts him in half.\n\nA bit of an L for madara, but at this point he literally doesn't give a shit, he knows that sasuke can't kill him.\n\nLets see, 2 Ls for madara, 2 Ls for naruto. I'd say it was about even. Even if team naruto was winning, madara definitely was not getting shit on. If you still disagree, we'll just have to agree to disagree and end the convo. \n\n>Yes his rinnegan lets him summon multiple limbo clones stated to be relative to his strength. In the manga naruto takes them on and isn't shown to be losing. In the anime naruto doesn't seem to be losing either he's just fighting. There's no indication that he is losing the fight in either.\n\nIn the anime naruto sounds kinda annoyed and pissed off. Definitely does sound like he was atleast somewhat struggling.\n\nAnd the manga it doesn't show anyone winning or losing, maybe naruto was stomping the limbo, maybe he was going even. I don't want to make any conclusions, which is just why i gave him the minimum of not being stomped by the limbo which is still a nice feat. (Consider that the limbo are trying to attack the ones on the ground kakashi sakura and the real naruto, and narutos shadow clones are holding them off). \n\n\n>Yes.. and that's not a weird concept either.

Madara literally does not land a hit on them the entire fight while they would have killed anyone without that level of healing multiple times over. Kishimoto was trying to make it VERY clear that madara was nothing compared to them now.\n\nI'm not sure you realise this, but 10 tails and onwards madara literally only lands one nice attack which was on the 4th hokage. After that he does not even land an attack on obito or kakashi or guy ect. Maybe we are reading the same story in a different lense, because I have never gotten the impression ever in my like 5 rewatches/rereads that naruto/sasuke were just leagues of madara.\n\nThe entire theme of the story in the war arc was indra and ashura working together to accomplish great stuff (it's literally written on the stone tablet, among the stuff that black zetsu revised)  The whole greater than the sum of its parts kinda thing. Which is why the sage gave half to naruto and half to sasuke, they needed eachother to beat madara, and I'm not just referring to the healing, the sage literally mentioned how strong madara was getting. \n\nIt wasn't implied to be like \"I've given half my power to the both of you, although naruto you can just go and stomp his ass by yourself\" because if that's how you see it, we really are reading 2 different series. \n\n>And of course double rinnegan madara low diffs pre god tree. Even if they were the same strength, double rinne madara has like 5 extra limbo clones that are stated to be similar in strength to the actual madara.

He's able to react to 8th gate guy's surprise attacks with the same ability. Hes barely able to stop a straight forward punch from hitting him.\n\nThey were referring to 10 tails, not the divine tree. And the divine tree has some amount of 10 tails chakra we just don't know how much, it's clearly not all of it, and they never say that obito was distinctively weaker without the tree. It gives him some amount of power and immortality.\n\nWhat?  That is immediately after taking in the divine tree.\n\n>At this point the edge goes to madara, seeing as how he was the only one to do damage.\n\nHe didn't do any damage while naruto hurt the limbo that he still hadn't figured out yet.. All he did was push the rod away that naruto was hanging on to. Clear L for madara because all of his attacks were dodged and even his secret ability was found out in seconds.\n\n>Then after that naruto and sasuke hit madara with their magnet style rasengan and six paths chidori, because of sasukes rinnegan, madara Could not only not see it coming, he literally couldn't do anything about it.

You're trolling me. I'm done with this conversation lol that's the worst argument I've ever heard. \n\n>Madara runs for his life while getting the shit beat out of him and literally gets cut in half\n\n\"Decent sized  L for naruto and sasuke\"\n\nBruh. You just love madara. No other excuse for that kind of bad faith argument. Madara landed no hits the whole fight. He's just able to run and stall for time long enough to start the infinite Tsukuyomi",

Compare that to literal teleportation, ofcourse Naruto and sasuke are gonna have an easier time first timing compared to madara. \n\nAnd he swatted naruto like a fly, i do give naruto props for sticking the landing. The most i can give this is an even, madara definitely didn't take an L. \n\n>Okay. You're trolling me. I'm done with this conversation lol that's the worst argument I've ever heard\n\nYou are coping so hard if you do not think it's an L for naruto and sasuke, they literally hit him with a free attack that he could not see coming nor do anything about, a literal sealing attack aswell. And he still tanked it and left the fucking sealing rasengan before they could touch him. That is an L for Naruto anyway you see it.\n\nLol go ahead and be done with the convo, i will never convince you and you will never convince me. \n\nI mean seriously, naruto being >>>>>>>> madara at that point.

You misremembered when it happens.\n\nYour whole argument hinges on the basis that narratively naruto shouldn't be stronger. Drop that and look at the actual fight. Madara lands 0 hits throughout multiple large power ups.\n\n\nYour whole argument relies on you misremembering the chapter/episodes and the idea that narratively they should not be much stronger. However, drop that headcanon and actually look at what happens and its clear that they are much stronger than madara individually.\n\nNo hits landed for madara. He's nearly killed by base 6p naruto pre god tree. He is literally chopped in half when he's running for his life. Gets another power up and still can't overpower them. You trying to say \"madara surprised naruto with an attack, that naruto dodged, and pushed naruto away is an big L\" is insanity. Madara literally landed nothing the whole fight and survived due to his hax limbo clones that they hadn't figured out yet.\n\nThis kind of power up is not close to unheard of in anime. Bleach does it, hxh does it, dragon ball does it all the time. Its often a cop out yes, but its well known kishimoto wrote himself into a corner. So he gave naruto and sasuke god like powers to kill the op boss he made.\n\nSo please stop responding with your headcanon and just reread the chapters",

The rasenshuriken leaves madara on the ground groaning in pain. He only has time to absorb the tree because naruto went to get guy.\n\nThen naruto and sasuke continue to dodge or block literally every single one of his attacks including surprise attacks (fang of light) and the limbo that they didn't know about yet. They stab him through the chest. They catch him in the sealing position and he uses substitution to escape. Then sasuke cuts him in half. Without immortality madara is dead 3 times there and naruto and sasuke don't have a scratch on them and haven't even used the bulk of their abilities. \n\nThere's no room to disagree. Its literally in the panels.  A complete one sided fight from start to finish and naruto and sasuke aren't even remotely worried until kaguya shows up. Where is the mid-high diff coming from if we haven't seen any evidence at all that madara can even hit them with a single attack?\n\nI feel like even you know that you're bullshitting here.

I honestly don't think the kcm cloak is that much of a boost at this point.\n\n>Madara reacted was barely able to react to it.\n\nWould not call it barely. He had enough time to make the truth seeker orb change into a staff then grab said staff and move it to block naruto. That is definitely a clean reaction. \n\n>He was literally laying on the ground while immobilized and then absorbed the god tree.\n\nI mean i guess you could see it that way. To me it looked like he was chilling until the 10 tails spoke to him.\n\n>Then him and sasuke continue to just shit on a much stronger madara.\n\nIt's not exactly stated or shown how much the god tree buffs someone. Could be minor, could be alot. Plus the most that happened to madara in that scuffle was him being cut in half (looks like I'm making it sound like nothing, but madara really didn't seem to give a shit). And he literally tanked their rasengan and chidori combination, and still substituted a shadow and left it before they could touch him. Maybe he didn't win the skirmish, but he definitely wasn't shat on. Also i definitely remember Naruto getting swatted like a fly in that skirmish.\n\n>Then madara gets his other rinnegan and gets a massive power up again and naruto and sasuke still prove to be about equally as strong or stronger than him individually (naruto clones fight evenly with limbo clones. sasuke fights with him one on one).\n\nWdym \"and a power boost\" do you mean a power up from getting the second rinnegan. And when naruto fights madaras limbo, manga doesn't show any more than one square box of them in fight, but the anime makes naruto sound like he's struggling. At minimum narutos shadow clones are strong enough to not get steam rolled by the limbo, so I'll give him that.  Also what do you mean by sasuke. Sasuke doesn't interact with madara at all after he cuts him in half before madara kamuid.\n\n>I think realistically its a no diff for 6p kcm naruto if its pre god tree madara. That's not really wanking naruto either, that's just the very clear implication that kishimoto wanted to give. Madara needed 2 massive power ups to even fight with them semi evenly before they understand their powers fully.\n\nSo you genuinely think that kishimoto made the main character so much unfathomably stronger than the current antagonist. Does not make sense from a narrative perspective. \n\nThere is atleast 2 examples where naruto heavily implied that he couldn't take madara by himself. \n\nAfter madara gets the god tree he says to naruto that he can't take him down, then naruto goes \"I'm not gonna take you down, we are\"\n\nAnd while madara was in kamui getting his second, he literally says the answer to take madara down was teamwork. \n\nAlso madara had no idea what naruto and sasukes abilities were, so it cancels out. (They literally got 2 freebies on him with sasukes rinnegan) \n\nAlso I don't even think final form madara low diffs pre god tree madara, so i definitely don't naruto does.",

He had enough time to make the truth seeker orb change into a staff then grab said staff and move it to block naruto. That is definitely a clean reaction.\n\nHe was able to change the truth seeking orb nearly instantly as seen in the guy fight. Guy was going for attacks from each side randomly to surprise madara and the orbs were able to keep up for the most part. Naruto attacked head on a madara caught it right before it hit his chest.\n\n>I mean i guess you could see it that way. To me it looked like he was chilling until the 10 tails spoke to him. \n\nI think you should look at that panel again lol. \"Just chilling until the 10 tails spoke to him.\" He was literally scared the tree was falling and didn't move.\n\n>It's not exactly stated or shown how much the god tree buffs someone. Could be minor, could be alot. \n\nMadara literally states \"I'm basically immortal now\" after getting the tree. So its safe to say it was a large boost. We also know that it was sizeable because they say kaguya has more chakra than even another god tree on top madara. Neither of those statements make sense if it was just some mediocre power up.\n\n>Plus the most that happened to madara in that scuffle was him being cut in half (looks like I'm making it sound like nothing, but madara really didn't seem to give a shit). And he literally tanked their rasengan and chidori combination, and still substituted a shadow and left it before they could touch him. Maybe he didn't win the skirmish, but he definitely wasn't shat on. Also i definitely remember Naruto getting swatted like a fly in that skirmish.\n\nMadara gets stabbed through the chest with effortlessly. Literally all of his attacks are dodged or blocked. He replaces himself with limbo to escape and he gets cut in half. They LITERALLY are no diffing him but don't know a way around his healing. I have no idea how you can say he wasn't shit on.\n\n>Wdym \"and a power boost\" do you mean a power up from getting the second rinnegan. And when naruto fights madaras limbo, manga doesn't show any more than one square box of them in fight, but the anime makes naruto sound like he's struggling. At minimum narutos shadow clones are strong enough to not get steam rolled by the limbo, so I'll give him that. Also what do you mean by sasuke. Sasuke doesn't interact with madara at all after he cuts him in half before madara kamuid.\n\nYes his rinnegan lets him summon multiple limbo clones stated to be relative to his strength. In the manga naruto takes them on and isn't shown to be losing. In the anime naruto doesn't seem to be losing either he's just fighting. There's no indication that he is losing the fight in either.\n\n>So you genuinely think that kishimoto made the main character so much unfathomably stronger than the current antagonist. Does not make sense from a narrative perspective.\n\nYes.. and that's not a weird concept either. Another one of the big 3 shounen does it against their big antagonist. Madara literally does not land a hit on them the entire fight while they would have killed anyone without that level of healing multiple times over. Kishimoto was trying to make it VERY clear that madara was nothing compared to them now.\n\n>After madara gets the god tree he says to naruto that he can't take him down, then naruto goes \"I'm not gonna take you down, we are\"\n\nThat does not imply that. That's just him iterating that him an sasuke are a team.\n\n>And while madara was in kamui getting his second, he literally says the answer to take madara down was teamwork\n\nYes because madara is able to fight semi evenly with double rinnegan. He still is clearly losing the fight but with all of his limbo clones and all the meteors he was able to stall them long enough to start the infinite tsukuyomi. The only reason one of them solo could not beat him is because they needed both of them to seal him and they weren't sure how to get around his immortality.\n\nSasuke and naruto don't know his abilities either. They learn about the limbo clones mid fight and still counter them easily.\n\nAnd of course double rinnegan madara low diffs pre god tree. Even if they were the same strength, double rinne madara has like 5 extra limbo clones that are stated to be similar in strength to the actual madara. But madara gets an extra rinnegan and a shit ton of chakra on top of that.\n\nIdk theres no implication that madara can actually fight evenly with them. Throughout the fight the only things they really are worried about is protecting the rest of the forces and actually getting him in a position to seal him. He can't hit them at all",

The only way this can become an argument is if you're trying to say that guys attack in that fight was moving faster than naruto was, which you clearly aren't. \n\nWhen naruto attacked madara, madara reacted to the attack, sent commands to change his truth seeking orbs shape, truth seeking orb changes it's shape (even if you think shape changing part happens instantly, madara still had to make it happen), then grabs it and pushes it into a position to block naruto.

He replaces himself with limbo to escape and he gets cut in half. They LITERALLY are no diffing him but don't know a way around his healing.

A bit of an L for madara, but there was literally no way he could see it coming. Plus honestly pre ten tails alive madara Could survive that impalement, even kakashi survived getting impaled by obito in their fight.\n\nAnd then at this point madara just wanted his other eye back.\n\nThen after that naruto and sasuke hit madara with their magnet style rasengan and six paths chidori, because of sasukes rinnegan, madara Could not only not see it coming, he literally couldn't do anything about it. Then he not only tanks their attack, he escapes it (the rasengan was literally made to seal his movements) and substitutes a shadow all before they can put their hands together and touch madara.\n\nBro this is a decently sized L for naruto and sasuke.\n\nThen madara just goes to get his other eye, and sasuke cuts him in half.\n\nA bit of an L for madara, but at this point he literally doesn't give a shit, he knows that sasuke can't kill him.\n\nLets see, 2 Ls for madara, 2 Ls for naruto. I'd say it was about even. Even if team naruto was winning, madara definitely was not getting shit on. If you still disagree, we'll just have to agree to disagree and end the convo. \n\n>Yes his rinnegan lets him summon multiple limbo clones stated to be relative to his strength. In the manga naruto takes them on and isn't shown to be losing. In the anime naruto doesn't seem to be losing either he's just fighting. There's no indication that he is losing the fight in either.\n\nIn the anime naruto sounds kinda annoyed and pissed off. Definitely does sound like he was atleast somewhat struggling.\n\nAnd the manga it doesn't show anyone winning or losing, maybe naruto was stomping the limbo, maybe he was going even. I don't want to make any conclusions, which is just why i gave him the minimum of not being stomped by the limbo which is still a nice feat. (Consider that the limbo are trying to attack the ones on the ground kakashi sakura and the real naruto, and narutos shadow clones are holding them off). \n\n\n>Yes.. and that's not a weird concept either.

Madara literally does not land a hit on them the entire fight while they would have killed anyone without that level of healing multiple times over. Kishimoto was trying to make it VERY clear that madara was nothing compared to them now.\n\nI'm not sure you realise this, but 10 tails and onwards madara literally only lands one nice attack which was on the 4th hokage. After that he does not even land an attack on obito or kakashi or guy ect. Maybe we are reading the same story in a different lense, because I have never gotten the impression ever in my like 5 rewatches/rereads that naruto/sasuke were just leagues of madara.\n\nThe entire theme of the story in the war arc was indra and ashura working together to accomplish great stuff (it's literally written on the stone tablet, among the stuff that black zetsu revised)  The whole greater than the sum of its parts kinda thing. Which is why the sage gave half to naruto and half to sasuke, they needed eachother to beat madara, and I'm not just referring to the healing, the sage literally mentioned how strong madara was getting. \n\nIt wasn't implied to be like \"I've given half my power to the both of you, although naruto you can just go and stomp his ass by yourself\" because if that's how you see it, we really are reading 2 different series. \n\n>And of course double rinnegan madara low diffs pre god tree. Even if they were the same strength, double rinne madara has like 5 extra limbo clones that are stated to be similar in strength to the actual madara.

Madara lands 0 hits throughout multiple large power ups.\n\n\nYour whole argument relies on you misremembering the chapter/episodes and the idea that narratively they should not be much stronger. However, drop that headcanon and actually look at what happens and its clear that they are much stronger than madara individually.\n\nNo hits landed for madara. He's nearly killed by base 6p naruto pre god tree. He is literally chopped in half when he's running for his life. Gets another power up and still can't overpower them. You trying to say \"madara surprised naruto with an attack, that naruto dodged, and pushed naruto away is an big L\" is insanity. Madara literally landed nothing the whole fight and survived due to his hax limbo clones that they hadn't figured out yet.\n\nThis kind of power up is not close to unheard of in anime. Bleach does it, hxh does it, dragon ball does it all the time. Its often a cop out yes, but its well known kishimoto wrote himself into a corner. So he gave naruto and sasuke god like powers to kill the op boss he made.\n\nSo please stop responding with your headcanon and just reread the chapters",

Most of what you said is just incorrect. Narutos lava rasenshuriken renders him immobilized nearly dead on the ground. He's bleeding from his mouth hurt badly laying on his back.\r  \n\r\n\nits one panel of him laying down, how do you even know hes immobilized, and hes bleeding from the mouth from the kick guy did, which you still forget that madara was literally almost dead from guy right when naruto came in, the only visible injury from the rasenshuriken is some sort of tear on his abdomen, you cant see much since its just ripped clothes.\n\nmy argument isnt just narrative. none of the feats suggest that madara is somehow far weaker than naruto and sasuke, none of the little fights they did had madara getting shit on. \n\nmadaras main goal was literally to get his other rinnegan back, that is all, after he escaped naruto and sasukes rasen chidori clash (which he litearlly fully tanked btw) he literally makes a B line straight to kakashis eye to get his rinnegan, lmao he was not running for his life. infact naruto and sasuke straight up fail twice at stopping the infinite tsukiyomi (they didnt stop madara from getting his eye, and they didnt stop him from launching the jutsu).\n\n>You trying to say \"madara surprised naruto with an attack, that naruto dodged, and pushed naruto away is an big L\" is insanity\n\ni didnt say it was a big L for naruto, i just said that at worst it was an even trade.\n\nthe big L was madara tanking and escaping naruto and sasukes rasen chidori clash before they can touch him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand madara doesnt land an attack on guy either, so i guess guy  >>>>>>>>>>>> madara according to you.\n\njust because it makes narrative sense in other arcs of other anime doesnt mean it makes narrative sense in this arc of this series.\n\nyou acknowledge that kishimoto made madara op, but you think kishimotos answer to this is to make naruto and sasuke not only as op as he is (which sure i agree) but far more ( which i disagree ).\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni can do the maths of it, base madara \u2248 kcm2 naruto. so therefore base madara + complete 10 tails and six paths > kcm2 naruto + piece of each tailed beast and six paths.\n\nor i could do it differently, the sage said that madara was getting close to him in power, so madara was about 80% of hagoromo (definetly above 50% otherwise his line wouldnt be relevant), and then the sage gave naruto 50% even if narutos base is some significant % of the sage, he definetly isnt gonna turn into like 200% of the sage.\n\nanyway i look at it, naruto isnt stomping 10 tails madara, not feats wise, not narratively, not even scaling wise. \n\nalso lol what is that link.",

The whole thing until madara activates his rinnesharingan is literally just feats for naruto and sasuke showing their new abilities, their speed, their attack power, etc. They dodge or block literally every attack and hit madara with almost everything except the first few attacks where they're learning how his limbo works.\n\nThe entire fight is just him running for his life and getting beat up and healing in the process. He wouldn't have survived multiple chapters, thats why it was made a quick and easy fight for them so kishimoto could  show the real final enemy.

How was him knocking madara onto the ground bleeding out of his mouth laying on his back not doing that? \n\nHe landed one rasenshuriken to an already injured madara (which is why madara was bleeding from the mouth) And there's no implication that he was immobilised.\n\n>They didn't need one. The whole point kishimoto was conveying is that naruto has far surpassed even madara now. The whole thing until madara activates his rinnesharingan is literally just feats for naruto and sasuke showing their new abilities, their speed, their attack power, etc. They dodge or block literally every attack and hit madara with almost everything except the first few attacks where they're learning how his limbo works.\n\nMadara LITERALLY TANKS AND ESCAPES THEIR  RASENGAN CHIDORI CLASH BEFORE THEY CAN EVEN TOUCH HIM. how can someone who's an order or magnitude weaker than one of them do that. \n\n>The entire fight is just him running for his life and getting beat up and healing in the process. He wouldn't have survived multiple chapters, thats why it was made a quick and easy fight for them so kishimoto could show the real final enemy.\n\nNo the entire fight is madara trying to activate the infinite tsukiyomi, madara says atleast 2 times that he wants his eye back, after sasuke stabs him with the sword using the amenotejikara madara literally says that he needs his other eye (kudos to naruto and sasuke for making him feel that way, but it isn't confirmation that he's getting kurbstomped) then literally every single action he takes from that point is literally just him going to his eye.\n\n>It wasn't supposed to be ambiguous. You really have to be trying your best to wank madara to say he would even lose high diff to them solo.\n\nYou are wanking the hell out of feats that aren't that major. The only feat that even resembles a no diff is sasuke cutting madara in half, but madara was literally immortal and didn't give a shit. \n\nWe are honestly going to have to agree to disagree, we have argued these same points over and over.",

He doesn't use force to break out. His limbo clone is stuck in there and naruto holds them.  \n\n>No the entire fight is madara trying to activate the infinite tsukiyomi, madara says atleast 2 times that he wants his eye back, after sasuke stabs him with the sword using the amenotejikara madara literally says that he needs his other eye (kudos to naruto and sasuke for making him feel that way, but it isn't confirmation that he's getting kurbstomped) then literally every single action he takes from that point is literally just him going to his eye.\n\nRight.... He totally doesn't fight them for a few minutes before running for his life after nearly getting sealed. He goes for his eye because he realizes he needs it to survive.\n\n>You are wanking the hell out of feats that aren't that major. The only feat that even resembles a no diff is sasuke cutting madara in half, but madara was literally immortal and didn't give a shit.\n\n>We are honestly going to have to agree to disagree, we have argued these same points over and over.\n\nNo. I am not.  The rasenshuriken leaves madara on the ground groaning in pain. He only has time to absorb the tree because naruto went to get guy.\n\nThen naruto and sasuke continue to dodge or block literally every single one of his attacks including surprise attacks (fang of light) and the limbo that they didn't know about yet. They stab him through the chest. They catch him in the sealing position and he uses substitution to escape. Then sasuke cuts him in half. Without immortality madara is dead 3 times there and naruto and sasuke don't have a scratch on them and haven't even used the bulk of their abilities. \n\nThere's no room to disagree. Its literally in the panels.  A complete one sided fight from start to finish and naruto and sasuke aren't even remotely worried until kaguya shows up. Where is the mid-high diff coming from if we haven't seen any evidence at all that madara can even hit them with a single attack?\n\nI feel like even you know that you're bullshitting here.

And when naruto fights madaras limbo, manga doesn't show any more than one square box of them in fight, but the anime makes naruto sound like he's struggling.

We also know that it was sizeable because they say kaguya has more chakra than even another god tree on top madara. Neither of those statements make sense if it was just some mediocre power up.\n\n>Plus the most that happened to madara in that scuffle was him being cut in half (looks like I'm making it sound like nothing, but madara really didn't seem to give a shit).

He replaces himself with limbo to escape and he gets cut in half. They LITERALLY are no diffing him but don't know a way around his healing. I have no idea how you can say he wasn't shit on.\n\n>Wdym \"and a power boost\" do you mean a power up from getting the second rinnegan.

At minimum narutos shadow clones are strong enough to not get steam rolled by the limbo, so I'll give him that. Also what do you mean by sasuke. Sasuke doesn't interact with madara at all after he cuts him in half before madara kamuid.\n\nYes his rinnegan lets him summon multiple limbo clones stated to be relative to his strength. In the manga naruto takes them on and isn't shown to be losing. In the anime naruto doesn't seem to be losing either he's just fighting. There's no indication that he is losing the fight in either.\n\n>So you genuinely think that kishimoto made the main character so much unfathomably stronger than the current antagonist. Does not make sense from a narrative perspective.\n\nYes.. and that's not a weird concept either. Another one of the big 3 shounen does it against their big antagonist. Madara literally does not land a hit on them the entire fight while they would have killed anyone without that level of healing multiple times over. Kishimoto was trying to make it VERY clear that madara was nothing compared to them now.\n\n>After madara gets the god tree he says to naruto that he can't take him down, then naruto goes \"I'm not gonna take you down, we are\"\n\nThat does not imply that. That's just him iterating that him an sasuke are a team.\n\n>And while madara was in kamui getting his second, he literally says the answer to take madara down was teamwork\n\nYes because madara is able to fight semi evenly with double rinnegan. He still is clearly losing the fight but with all of his limbo clones and all the meteors he was able to stall them long enough to start the infinite tsukuyomi. The only reason one of them solo could not beat him is because they needed both of them to seal him and they weren't sure how to get around his immortality.\n\nSasuke and naruto don't know his abilities either. They learn about the limbo clones mid fight and still counter them easily.\n\nAnd of course double rinnegan madara low diffs pre god tree. Even if they were the same strength, double rinne madara has like 5 extra limbo clones that are stated to be similar in strength to the actual madara. But madara gets an extra rinnegan and a shit ton of chakra on top of that.\n\nIdk theres no implication that madara can actually fight evenly with them. Throughout the fight the only things they really are worried about is protecting the rest of the forces and actually getting him in a position to seal him. He can't hit them at all",

The only way this can become an argument is if you're trying to say that guys attack in that fight was moving faster than naruto was, which you clearly aren't. \n\nWhen naruto attacked madara, madara reacted to the attack, sent commands to change his truth seeking orbs shape, truth seeking orb changes it's shape (even if you think shape changing part happens instantly, madara still had to make it happen), then grabs it and pushes it into a position to block naruto. This is a clean reaction anyway you see it.\n\n\n\n>I think you should look at that panel again lol. \"Just chilling until the 10 tails spoke to him.\" He was literally scared the tree was falling and didn't move.\n\nDidn't or couldn't. Because he was injured, but not like \"i almost died you bastard\" injured. It's not like he couldn't move. \n\n>Madara literally states \"I'm basically immortal now\" after getting the tree. So its safe to say it was a large boost. We also know that it was sizeable because they say kaguya has more chakra than even another god tree on top madara. Neither of those statements make sense if it was just some mediocre power up.\n\nThey were referring to 10 tails, not the divine tree. And the divine tree has some amount of 10 tails chakra we just don't know how much, it's clearly not all of it, and they never say that obito was distinctively weaker without the tree. It gives him some amount of power and immortality.\n\n>Madara gets stabbed through the chest with effortlessly. Literally all of his attacks are dodged or blocked. He replaces himself with limbo to escape and he gets cut in half. They LITERALLY are no diffing him but don't know a way around his healing. I have no idea how you can say he wasn't shit on.\n\nLets see, madara launches the lightning style jutsu, naruto blocks it with TSB, naruto tries to attack madara, madara blocks it with limbo, madara uses fang of light, Naruto dodges it then madara hits him with the limbo clone and sends him flying to the floor.\n\nThis is kind of an L for Naruto.\n\nAt this point the edge goes to madara, seeing as how he was the only one to do damage.\n\nThen he tries to take sasukes eye and sasuke switches with the sword and he gets impaled. A bit of an L for madara, but there was literally no way he could see it coming. Plus honestly pre ten tails alive madara Could survive that impalement, even kakashi survived getting impaled by obito in their fight.\n\nAnd then at this point madara just wanted his other eye back.\n\nThen after that naruto and sasuke hit madara with their magnet style rasengan and six paths chidori, because of sasukes rinnegan, madara Could not only not see it coming, he literally couldn't do anything about it. Then he not only tanks their attack, he escapes it (the rasengan was literally made to seal his movements) and substitutes a shadow all before they can put their hands together and touch madara.\n\nBro this is a decently sized L for naruto and sasuke.\n\nThen madara just goes to get his other eye, and sasuke cuts him in half.\n\nA bit of an L for madara, but at this point he literally doesn't give a shit, he knows that sasuke can't kill him.\n\nLets see, 2 Ls for madara, 2 Ls for naruto. I'd say it was about even. Even if team naruto was winning, madara definitely was not getting shit on. If you still disagree, we'll just have to agree to disagree and end the convo. \n\n>Yes his rinnegan lets him summon multiple limbo clones stated to be relative to his strength. In the manga naruto takes them on and isn't shown to be losing. In the anime naruto doesn't seem to be losing either he's just fighting. There's no indication that he is losing the fight in either.\n\nIn the anime naruto sounds kinda annoyed and pissed off. Definitely does sound like he was atleast somewhat struggling.\n\nAnd the manga it doesn't show anyone winning or losing, maybe naruto was stomping the limbo, maybe he was going even. I don't want to make any conclusions, which is just why i gave him the minimum of not being stomped by the limbo which is still a nice feat. (Consider that the limbo are trying to attack the ones on the ground kakashi sakura and the real naruto, and narutos shadow clones are holding them off). \n\n\n>Yes.. and that's not a weird concept either. Another one of the big 3 shounen does it against their big antagonist. Madara literally does not land a hit on them the entire fight while they would have killed anyone without that level of healing multiple times over. Kishimoto was trying to make it VERY clear that madara was nothing compared to them now.\n\nI'm not sure you realise this, but 10 tails and onwards madara literally only lands one nice attack which was on the 4th hokage. After that he does not even land an attack on obito or kakashi or guy ect. Maybe we are reading the same story in a different lense, because I have never gotten the impression ever in my like 5 rewatches/rereads that naruto/sasuke were just leagues of madara.\n\nThe entire theme of the story in the war arc was indra and ashura working together to accomplish great stuff (it's literally written on the stone tablet, among the stuff that black zetsu revised)  The whole greater than the sum of its parts kinda thing. Which is why the sage gave half to naruto and half to sasuke, they needed eachother to beat madara, and I'm not just referring to the healing, the sage literally mentioned how strong madara was getting. \n\nIt wasn't implied to be like \"I've given half my power to the both of you, although naruto you can just go and stomp his ass by yourself\" because if that's how you see it, we really are reading 2 different series. \n\n>And of course double rinnegan madara low diffs pre god tree. Even if they were the same strength, double rinne madara has like 5 extra limbo clones that are stated to be similar in strength to the actual madara. But madara gets an extra rinnegan and a shit ton of chakra on top of that.\n\nI wasn't thinking of the limbo clone extension when i was talking about that, but just real madara vs real madara.",

However, drop that headcanon and actually look at what happens and its clear that they are much stronger than madara individually.\n\nNo hits landed for madara. He's nearly killed by base 6p naruto pre god tree. He is literally chopped in half when he's running for his life. Gets another power up and still can't overpower them. You trying to say \"madara surprised naruto with an attack, that naruto dodged, and pushed naruto away is an big L\" is insanity. Madara literally landed nothing the whole fight and survived due to his hax limbo clones that they hadn't figured out yet.\n\nThis kind of power up is not close to unheard of in anime. Bleach does it, hxh does it, dragon ball does it all the time. Its often a cop out yes, but its well known kishimoto wrote himself into a corner.

We know this because he literally slaps him around before powering up and then continues to slap him around after both of them power up\n\nNaruto and sasuke weren't purely strong from the sage's chakra. The seals on the hand were 50% of his chakra and that was used mostly for sealing kaguya. six path sage mode was from having all 9 tailed beasts in naruto. Rinnegan was from either getting hagoromos chakra or from hashirama cells, its unclear but hashirama cells is the only was its happened in the past so probably that.\n\nAlso another thing I missed about the god tree. They say kaguya is greater than another god tree added onto madara. Sasuke is so scared by that amount of chakra that he is surprised someone that strong could have ever existed. That was just being completely unfazed by seeing madara at his full strength.

We know this because he literally slaps him around before powering up and then continues to slap him around after both of them power up\r  \n\r\n\nwe will keep disagreeing on this point, because i do not agree that it was \"a slap up\". the highlight of the scuffle was narutos rasenshuriken which definetly was not shown to almost kill him or anything like guy did, and madara at that point didnt even properly heal after almost dying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Naruto and sasuke weren't purely strong from the sage's chakra. The seals on the hand were 50% of his chakra and that was used mostly for sealing kaguya. six path sage mode was from having all 9 tailed beasts in naruto. Rinnegan was from either getting hagoromos chakra or from hashirama cells, its unclear but hashirama cells is the only was its happened in the past so probably that.\r  \n\r\n\nwhat no, hagoromo does give him power not just in the seals. and even if you were correct, it would benefit my argument even more, narutos power up coming from the bits of chakra from the tailed beasts while madara had the complete 10 tails. \n\n>Also another thing I missed about the god tree. They say kaguya is greater than another god tree added onto madara. Sasuke is so scared by that amount of chakra that he is surprised someone that strong could have ever existed. That was just being completely unfazed by seeing madara at his full strength. So clearly using the god tree to be relative to that power up means that it is an IMMENSE power up.\n\nwrong again, and you are the one telling me to read the manga\n\n[https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Naruto/0679-003.png](https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Naruto/0679-003.png)\n\nliterally says the 10 tails. even the anime says the 10 tails.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>We can say that confidently because they continue to get stronger without the seals containing the chakra (valley of the end, the last, boruto etc)\r  \n\r\n\nwhat exactly does that sentence have to do with the previous paragraph.",

They stab him through the chest. They catch him in the sealing position and he uses substitution to escape. Then sasuke cuts him in half. Without immortality madara is dead 3 times there and naruto and sasuke don't have a scratch on them and haven't even used the bulk of their abilities. \n\nThere's no room to disagree. Its literally in the panels.  A complete one sided fight from start to finish and naruto and sasuke aren't even remotely worried until kaguya shows up. Where is the mid-high diff coming from if we haven't seen any evidence at all that madara can even hit them with a single attack?\n\nI feel like even you know that you're bullshitting here. The claim you're making is so far from what's shown and implied in the panels that I don't think you genuinely could believe it now that you've reread.",

I honestly don't think the kcm cloak is that much of a boost at this point.\n\n>Madara reacted was barely able to react to it.\n\nWould not call it barely. He had enough time to make the truth seeker orb change into a staff then grab said staff and move it to block naruto. That is definitely a clean reaction. \n\n>He was literally laying on the ground while immobilized and then absorbed the god tree.\n\nI mean i guess you could see it that way. To me it looked like he was chilling until the 10 tails spoke to him.\n\n>Then him and sasuke continue to just shit on a much stronger madara.\n\nIt's not exactly stated or shown how much the god tree buffs someone. Could be minor, could be alot. Plus the most that happened to madara in that scuffle was him being cut in half (looks like I'm making it sound like nothing, but madara really didn't seem to give a shit). And he literally tanked their rasengan and chidori combination, and still substituted a shadow and left it before they could touch him. Maybe he didn't win the skirmish, but he definitely wasn't shat on. Also i definitely remember Naruto getting swatted like a fly in that skirmish.\n\n>Then madara gets his other rinnegan and gets a massive power up again and naruto and sasuke still prove to be about equally as strong or stronger than him individually (naruto clones fight evenly with limbo clones. sasuke fights with him one on one).\n\nWdym \"and a power boost\" do you mean a power up from getting the second rinnegan. And when naruto fights madaras limbo, manga doesn't show any more than one square box of them in fight, but the anime makes naruto sound like he's struggling. At minimum narutos shadow clones are strong enough to not get steam rolled by the limbo, so I'll give him that.  Also what do you mean by sasuke. Sasuke doesn't interact with madara at all after he cuts him in half before madara kamuid.\n\n>I think realistically its a no diff for 6p kcm naruto if its pre god tree madara. That's not really wanking naruto either, that's just the very clear implication that kishimoto wanted to give. Madara needed 2 massive power ups to even fight with them semi evenly before they understand their powers fully.\n\nSo you genuinely think that kishimoto made the main character so much unfathomably stronger than the current antagonist. Does not make sense from a narrative perspective. \n\nThere is atleast 2 examples where naruto heavily implied that he couldn't take madara by himself. \n\nAfter madara gets the god tree he says to naruto that he can't take him down, then naruto goes \"I'm not gonna take you down, we are\"\n\nAnd while madara was in kamui getting his second, he literally says the answer to take madara down was teamwork. \n\nAlso madara had no idea what naruto and sasukes abilities were, so it cancels out. (They literally got 2 freebies on him with sasukes rinnegan) \n\nAlso I don't even think final form madara low diffs pre god tree madara, so i definitely don't naruto does.",

That is definitely a clean reaction.\n\nHe was able to change the truth seeking orb nearly instantly as seen in the guy fight. Guy was going for attacks from each side randomly to surprise madara and the orbs were able to keep up for the most part. Naruto attacked head on a madara caught it right before it hit his chest.\n\n>I mean i guess you could see it that way. To me it looked like he was chilling until the 10 tails spoke to him. \n\nI think you should look at that panel again lol. \"Just chilling until the 10 tails spoke to him.\" He was literally scared the tree was falling and didn't move.\n\n>It's not exactly stated or shown how much the god tree buffs someone. Could be minor, could be alot. \n\nMadara literally states \"I'm basically immortal now\" after getting the tree. So its safe to say it was a large boost. We also know that it was sizeable because they say kaguya has more chakra than even another god tree on top madara. Neither of those statements make sense if it was just some mediocre power up.\n\n>Plus the most that happened to madara in that scuffle was him being cut in half (looks like I'm making it sound like nothing, but madara really didn't seem to give a shit). And he literally tanked their rasengan and chidori combination, and still substituted a shadow and left it before they could touch him. Maybe he didn't win the skirmish, but he definitely wasn't shat on. Also i definitely remember Naruto getting swatted like a fly in that skirmish.\n\nMadara gets stabbed through the chest with effortlessly. Literally all of his attacks are dodged or blocked. He replaces himself with limbo to escape and he gets cut in half. They LITERALLY are no diffing him but don't know a way around his healing. I have no idea how you can say he wasn't shit on.\n\n>Wdym \"and a power boost\" do you mean a power up from getting the second rinnegan. And when naruto fights madaras limbo, manga doesn't show any more than one square box of them in fight, but the anime makes naruto sound like he's struggling. At minimum narutos shadow clones are strong enough to not get steam rolled by the limbo, so I'll give him that. Also what do you mean by sasuke. Sasuke doesn't interact with madara at all after he cuts him in half before madara kamuid.\n\nYes his rinnegan lets him summon multiple limbo clones stated to be relative to his strength. In the manga naruto takes them on and isn't shown to be losing. In the anime naruto doesn't seem to be losing either he's just fighting. There's no indication that he is losing the fight in either.\n\n>So you genuinely think that kishimoto made the main character so much unfathomably stronger than the current antagonist. Does not make sense from a narrative perspective.\n\nYes.. and that's not a weird concept either. Another one of the big 3 shounen does it against their big antagonist. Madara literally does not land a hit on them the entire fight while they would have killed anyone without that level of healing multiple times over. Kishimoto was trying to make it VERY clear that madara was nothing compared to them now.\n\n>After madara gets the god tree he says to naruto that he can't take him down, then naruto goes \"I'm not gonna take you down, we are\"\n\nThat does not imply that. That's just him iterating that him an sasuke are a team.\n\n>And while madara was in kamui getting his second, he literally says the answer to take madara down was teamwork\n\nYes because madara is able to fight semi evenly with double rinnegan. He still is clearly losing the fight but with all of his limbo clones and all the meteors he was able to stall them long enough to start the infinite tsukuyomi. The only reason one of them solo could not beat him is because they needed both of them to seal him and they weren't sure how to get around his immortality.\n\nSasuke and naruto don't know his abilities either. They learn about the limbo clones mid fight and still counter them easily.\n\nAnd of course double rinnegan madara low diffs pre god tree. Even if they were the same strength, double rinne madara has like 5 extra limbo clones that are stated to be similar in strength to the actual madara. But madara gets an extra rinnegan and a shit ton of chakra on top of that.\n\nIdk theres no implication that madara can actually fight evenly with them. Throughout the fight the only things they really are worried about is protecting the rest of the forces and actually getting him in a position to seal him. He can't hit them at all",

The only way this can become an argument is if you're trying to say that guys attack in that fight was moving faster than naruto was, which you clearly aren't. \n\nWhen naruto attacked madara, madara reacted to the attack, sent commands to change his truth seeking orbs shape, truth seeking orb changes it's shape (even if you think shape changing part happens instantly, madara still had to make it happen), then grabs it and pushes it into a position to block naruto.

And the divine tree has some amount of 10 tails chakra we just don't know how much, it's clearly not all of it, and they never say that obito was distinctively weaker without the tree. It gives him some amount of power and immortality.\n\n>Madara gets stabbed through the chest with effortlessly. Literally all of his attacks are dodged or blocked. He replaces himself with limbo to escape and he gets cut in half. They LITERALLY are no diffing him but don't know a way around his healing.

A bit of an L for madara, but there was literally no way he could see it coming. Plus honestly pre ten tails alive madara Could survive that impalement, even kakashi survived getting impaled by obito in their fight.\n\nAnd then at this point madara just wanted his other eye back.\n\nThen after that naruto and sasuke hit madara with their magnet style rasengan and six paths chidori, because of sasukes rinnegan, madara Could not only not see it coming, he literally couldn't do anything about it. Then he not only tanks their attack, he escapes it (the rasengan was literally made to seal his movements) and substitutes a shadow all before they can put their hands together and touch madara.\n\nBro this is a decently sized L for naruto and sasuke.\n\nThen madara just goes to get his other eye, and sasuke cuts him in half.\n\nA bit of an L for madara, but at this point he literally doesn't give a shit, he knows that sasuke can't kill him.\n\nLets see, 2 Ls for madara, 2 Ls for naruto. I'd say it was about even. Even if team naruto was winning, madara definitely was not getting shit on. If you still disagree, we'll just have to agree to disagree and end the convo. \n\n>Yes his rinnegan lets him summon multiple limbo clones stated to be relative to his strength. In the manga naruto takes them on and isn't shown to be losing. In the anime naruto doesn't seem to be losing either he's just fighting. There's no indication that he is losing the fight in either.\n\nIn the anime naruto sounds kinda annoyed and pissed off. Definitely does sound like he was atleast somewhat struggling.\n\nAnd the manga it doesn't show anyone winning or losing, maybe naruto was stomping the limbo, maybe he was going even. I don't want to make any conclusions, which is just why i gave him the minimum of not being stomped by the limbo which is still a nice feat. (Consider that the limbo are trying to attack the ones on the ground kakashi sakura and the real naruto, and narutos shadow clones are holding them off). \n\n\n>Yes.. and that's not a weird concept either.

Kishimoto was trying to make it VERY clear that madara was nothing compared to them now.\n\nI'm not sure you realise this, but 10 tails and onwards madara literally only lands one nice attack which was on the 4th hokage. After that he does not even land an attack on obito or kakashi or guy ect. Maybe we are reading the same story in a different lense, because I have never gotten the impression ever in my like 5 rewatches/rereads that naruto/sasuke were just leagues of madara.\n\nThe entire theme of the story in the war arc was indra and ashura working together to accomplish great stuff (it's literally written on the stone tablet, among the stuff that black zetsu revised)  The whole greater than the sum of its parts kinda thing. Which is why the sage gave half to naruto and half to sasuke, they needed eachother to beat madara, and I'm not just referring to the healing, the sage literally mentioned how strong madara was getting. \n\nIt wasn't implied to be like \"I've given half my power to the both of you, although naruto you can just go and stomp his ass by yourself\" because if that's how you see it, we really are reading 2 different series. \n\n>And of course double rinnegan madara low diffs pre god tree. Even if they were the same strength, double rinne madara has like 5 extra limbo clones that are stated to be similar in strength to the actual madara.

And he still tanked it and left the fucking sealing rasengan before they could touch him. That is an L for Naruto anyway you see it.\n\nLol go ahead and be done with the convo, i will never convince you and you will never convince me. \n\nI mean seriously, naruto being >>>>>>>> madara at that point.

Madara lands 0 hits throughout multiple large power ups.\n\n\nYour whole argument relies on you misremembering the chapter/episodes and the idea that narratively they should not be much stronger. However, drop that headcanon and actually look at what happens and its clear that they are much stronger than madara individually.\n\nNo hits landed for madara. He's nearly killed by base 6p naruto pre god tree. He is literally chopped in half when he's running for his life. Gets another power up and still can't overpower them. You trying to say \"madara surprised naruto with an attack, that naruto dodged, and pushed naruto away is an big L\" is insanity. Madara literally landed nothing the whole fight and survived due to his hax limbo clones that they hadn't figured out yet.\n\nThis kind of power up is not close to unheard of in anime. Bleach does it, hxh does it, dragon ball does it all the time. Its often a cop out yes, but its well known kishimoto wrote himself into a corner.

He's bleeding from his mouth hurt badly laying on his back.\r  \n\r\n\nits one panel of him laying down, how do you even know hes immobilized, and hes bleeding from the mouth from the kick guy did, which you still forget that madara was literally almost dead from guy right when naruto came in, the only visible injury from the rasenshuriken is some sort of tear on his abdomen, you cant see much since its just ripped clothes.\n\nmy argument isnt just narrative. none of the feats suggest that madara is somehow far weaker than naruto and sasuke, none of the little fights they did had madara getting shit on. \n\nmadaras main goal was literally to get his other rinnegan back, that is all, after he escaped naruto and sasukes rasen chidori clash (which he litearlly fully tanked btw) he literally makes a B line straight to kakashis eye to get his rinnegan, lmao he was not running for his life. infact naruto and sasuke straight up fail twice at stopping the infinite tsukiyomi (they didnt stop madara from getting his eye, and they didnt stop him from launching the jutsu).\n\n>You trying to say \"madara surprised naruto with an attack, that naruto dodged, and pushed naruto away is an big L\" is insanity\n\ni didnt say it was a big L for naruto, i just said that at worst it was an even trade.\n\nthe big L was madara tanking and escaping naruto and sasukes rasen chidori clash before they can touch him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand madara doesnt land an attack on guy either, so i guess guy  >>>>>>>>>>>> madara according to you.\n\njust because it makes narrative sense in other arcs of other anime doesnt mean it makes narrative sense in this arc of this series.\n\nyou acknowledge that kishimoto made madara op, but you think kishimotos answer to this is to make naruto and sasuke not only as op as he is (which sure i agree) but far more ( which i disagree ).\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni can do the maths of it, base madara \u2248 kcm2 naruto. so therefore base madara + complete 10 tails and six paths > kcm2 naruto + piece of each tailed beast and six paths.\n\nor i could do it differently, the sage said that madara was getting close to him in power, so madara was about 80% of hagoromo (definetly above 50% otherwise his line wouldnt be relevant), and then the sage gave naruto 50% even if narutos base is some significant % of the sage, he definetly isnt gonna turn into like 200% of the sage.\n\nanyway i look at it, naruto isnt stomping 10 tails madara, not feats wise, not narratively, not even scaling wise. \n\nalso lol what is that link.",

He doesn't use force to break out. His limbo clone is stuck in there and naruto holds them.  \n\n>No the entire fight is madara trying to activate the infinite tsukiyomi, madara says atleast 2 times that he wants his eye back, after sasuke stabs him with the sword using the amenotejikara madara literally says that he needs his other eye (kudos to naruto and sasuke for making him feel that way, but it isn't confirmation that he's getting kurbstomped) then literally every single action he takes from that point is literally just him going to his eye.\n\nRight.... He totally doesn't fight them for a few minutes before running for his life after nearly getting sealed. He goes for his eye because he realizes he needs it to survive.\n\n>You are wanking the hell out of feats that aren't that major.

The rasenshuriken leaves madara on the ground groaning in pain. He only has time to absorb the tree because naruto went to get guy.\n\nThen naruto and sasuke continue to dodge or block literally every single one of his attacks including surprise attacks (fang of light) and the limbo that they didn't know about yet. They stab him through the chest. They catch him in the sealing position and he uses substitution to escape. Then sasuke cuts him in half. Without immortality madara is dead 3 times there and naruto and sasuke don't have a scratch on them and haven't even used the bulk of their abilities. \n\nThere's no room to disagree. Its literally in the panels.  A complete one sided fight from start to finish and naruto and sasuke aren't even remotely worried until kaguya shows up. Where is the mid-high diff coming from if we haven't seen any evidence at all that madara can even hit them with a single attack?\n\nI feel like even you know that you're bullshitting here.

I honestly don't think the kcm cloak is that much of a boost at this point.\n\n>Madara reacted was barely able to react to it.\n\nWould not call it barely. He had enough time to make the truth seeker orb change into a staff then grab said staff and move it to block naruto. That is definitely a clean reaction. \n\n>He was literally laying on the ground while immobilized and then absorbed the god tree.\n\nI mean i guess you could see it that way. To me it looked like he was chilling until the 10 tails spoke to him.\n\n>Then him and sasuke continue to just shit on a much stronger madara.\n\nIt's not exactly stated or shown how much the god tree buffs someone. Could be minor, could be alot. Plus the most that happened to madara in that scuffle was him being cut in half (looks like I'm making it sound like nothing, but madara really didn't seem to give a shit). And he literally tanked their rasengan and chidori combination, and still substituted a shadow and left it before they could touch him. Maybe he didn't win the skirmish, but he definitely wasn't shat on. Also i definitely remember Naruto getting swatted like a fly in that skirmish.\n\n>Then madara gets his other rinnegan and gets a massive power up again and naruto and sasuke still prove to be about equally as strong or stronger than him individually (naruto clones fight evenly with limbo clones. sasuke fights with him one on one).\n\nWdym \"and a power boost\" do you mean a power up from getting the second rinnegan. And when naruto fights madaras limbo, manga doesn't show any more than one square box of them in fight, but the anime makes naruto sound like he's struggling. At minimum narutos shadow clones are strong enough to not get steam rolled by the limbo, so I'll give him that.  Also what do you mean by sasuke. Sasuke doesn't interact with madara at all after he cuts him in half before madara kamuid.\n\n>I think realistically its a no diff for 6p kcm naruto if its pre god tree madara. That's not really wanking naruto either, that's just the very clear implication that kishimoto wanted to give. Madara needed 2 massive power ups to even fight with them semi evenly before they understand their powers fully.\n\nSo you genuinely think that kishimoto made the main character so much unfathomably stronger than the current antagonist. Does not make sense from a narrative perspective. \n\nThere is atleast 2 examples where naruto heavily implied that he couldn't take madara by himself. \n\nAfter madara gets the god tree he says to naruto that he can't take him down, then naruto goes \"I'm not gonna take you down, we are\"\n\nAnd while madara was in kamui getting his second, he literally says the answer to take madara down was teamwork. \n\nAlso madara had no idea what naruto and sasukes abilities were, so it cancels out. (They literally got 2 freebies on him with sasukes rinnegan) \n\nAlso I don't even think final form madara low diffs pre god tree madara, so i definitely don't naruto does.",

That is definitely a clean reaction.\n\nHe was able to change the truth seeking orb nearly instantly as seen in the guy fight. Guy was going for attacks from each side randomly to surprise madara and the orbs were able to keep up for the most part. Naruto attacked head on a madara caught it right before it hit his chest.\n\n>I mean i guess you could see it that way. To me it looked like he was chilling until the 10 tails spoke to him. \n\nI think you should look at that panel again lol. \"Just chilling until the 10 tails spoke to him.\" He was literally scared the tree was falling and didn't move.\n\n>It's not exactly stated or shown how much the god tree buffs someone. Could be minor, could be alot. \n\nMadara literally states \"I'm basically immortal now\" after getting the tree. So its safe to say it was a large boost. We also know that it was sizeable because they say kaguya has more chakra than even another god tree on top madara. Neither of those statements make sense if it was just some mediocre power up.\n\n>Plus the most that happened to madara in that scuffle was him being cut in half (looks like I'm making it sound like nothing, but madara really didn't seem to give a shit). And he literally tanked their rasengan and chidori combination, and still substituted a shadow and left it before they could touch him. Maybe he didn't win the skirmish, but he definitely wasn't shat on. Also i definitely remember Naruto getting swatted like a fly in that skirmish.\n\nMadara gets stabbed through the chest with effortlessly. Literally all of his attacks are dodged or blocked. He replaces himself with limbo to escape and he gets cut in half. They LITERALLY are no diffing him but don't know a way around his healing. I have no idea how you can say he wasn't shit on.\n\n>Wdym \"and a power boost\" do you mean a power up from getting the second rinnegan. And when naruto fights madaras limbo, manga doesn't show any more than one square box of them in fight, but the anime makes naruto sound like he's struggling. At minimum narutos shadow clones are strong enough to not get steam rolled by the limbo, so I'll give him that. Also what do you mean by sasuke. Sasuke doesn't interact with madara at all after he cuts him in half before madara kamuid.\n\nYes his rinnegan lets him summon multiple limbo clones stated to be relative to his strength. In the manga naruto takes them on and isn't shown to be losing. In the anime naruto doesn't seem to be losing either he's just fighting. There's no indication that he is losing the fight in either.\n\n>So you genuinely think that kishimoto made the main character so much unfathomably stronger than the current antagonist. Does not make sense from a narrative perspective.\n\nYes.. and that's not a weird concept either. Another one of the big 3 shounen does it against their big antagonist. Madara literally does not land a hit on them the entire fight while they would have killed anyone without that level of healing multiple times over. Kishimoto was trying to make it VERY clear that madara was nothing compared to them now.\n\n>After madara gets the god tree he says to naruto that he can't take him down, then naruto goes \"I'm not gonna take you down, we are\"\n\nThat does not imply that. That's just him iterating that him an sasuke are a team.\n\n>And while madara was in kamui getting his second, he literally says the answer to take madara down was teamwork\n\nYes because madara is able to fight semi evenly with double rinnegan. He still is clearly losing the fight but with all of his limbo clones and all the meteors he was able to stall them long enough to start the infinite tsukuyomi. The only reason one of them solo could not beat him is because they needed both of them to seal him and they weren't sure how to get around his immortality.\n\nSasuke and naruto don't know his abilities either. They learn about the limbo clones mid fight and still counter them easily.\n\nAnd of course double rinnegan madara low diffs pre god tree. Even if they were the same strength, double rinne madara has like 5 extra limbo clones that are stated to be similar in strength to the actual madara. But madara gets an extra rinnegan and a shit ton of chakra on top of that.\n\nIdk theres no implication that madara can actually fight evenly with them. Throughout the fight the only things they really are worried about is protecting the rest of the forces and actually getting him in a position to seal him. He can't hit them at all",

The only way this can become an argument is if you're trying to say that guys attack in that fight was moving faster than naruto was, which you clearly aren't. \n\nWhen naruto attacked madara, madara reacted to the attack, sent commands to change his truth seeking orbs shape, truth seeking orb changes it's shape (even if you think shape changing part happens instantly, madara still had to make it happen), then grabs it and pushes it into a position to block naruto.

He replaces himself with limbo to escape and he gets cut in half. They LITERALLY are no diffing him but don't know a way around his healing.

A bit of an L for madara, but there was literally no way he could see it coming. Plus honestly pre ten tails alive madara Could survive that impalement, even kakashi survived getting impaled by obito in their fight.\n\nAnd then at this point madara just wanted his other eye back.\n\nThen after that naruto and sasuke hit madara with their magnet style rasengan and six paths chidori, because of sasukes rinnegan, madara Could not only not see it coming, he literally couldn't do anything about it. Then he not only tanks their attack, he escapes it (the rasengan was literally made to seal his movements) and substitutes a shadow all before they can put their hands together and touch madara.\n\nBro this is a decently sized L for naruto and sasuke.\n\nThen madara just goes to get his other eye, and sasuke cuts him in half.\n\nA bit of an L for madara, but at this point he literally doesn't give a shit, he knows that sasuke can't kill him.\n\nLets see, 2 Ls for madara, 2 Ls for naruto. I'd say it was about even. Even if team naruto was winning, madara definitely was not getting shit on. If you still disagree, we'll just have to agree to disagree and end the convo. \n\n>Yes his rinnegan lets him summon multiple limbo clones stated to be relative to his strength. In the manga naruto takes them on and isn't shown to be losing. In the anime naruto doesn't seem to be losing either he's just fighting. There's no indication that he is losing the fight in either.\n\nIn the anime naruto sounds kinda annoyed and pissed off. Definitely does sound like he was atleast somewhat struggling.\n\nAnd the manga it doesn't show anyone winning or losing, maybe naruto was stomping the limbo, maybe he was going even. I don't want to make any conclusions, which is just why i gave him the minimum of not being stomped by the limbo which is still a nice feat. (Consider that the limbo are trying to attack the ones on the ground kakashi sakura and the real naruto, and narutos shadow clones are holding them off). \n\n\n>Yes.. and that's not a weird concept either.

After that he does not even land an attack on obito or kakashi or guy ect. Maybe we are reading the same story in a different lense, because I have never gotten the impression ever in my like 5 rewatches/rereads that naruto/sasuke were just leagues of madara.\n\nThe entire theme of the story in the war arc was indra and ashura working together to accomplish great stuff (it's literally written on the stone tablet, among the stuff that black zetsu revised)  The whole greater than the sum of its parts kinda thing. Which is why the sage gave half to naruto and half to sasuke, they needed eachother to beat madara, and I'm not just referring to the healing, the sage literally mentioned how strong madara was getting. \n\nIt wasn't implied to be like \"I've given half my power to the both of you, although naruto you can just go and stomp his ass by yourself\" because if that's how you see it, we really are reading 2 different series. \n\n>And of course double rinnegan madara low diffs pre god tree.

However, drop that headcanon and actually look at what happens and its clear that they are much stronger than madara individually.\n\nNo hits landed for madara. He's nearly killed by base 6p naruto pre god tree. He is literally chopped in half when he's running for his life. Gets another power up and still can't overpower them. You trying to say \"madara surprised naruto with an attack, that naruto dodged, and pushed naruto away is an big L\" is insanity. Madara literally landed nothing the whole fight and survived due to his hax limbo clones that they hadn't figured out yet.\n\nThis kind of power up is not close to unheard of in anime. Bleach does it, hxh does it, dragon ball does it all the time. Its often a cop out yes, but its well known kishimoto wrote himself into a corner.

They stab him through the chest. They catch him in the sealing position and he uses substitution to escape. Then sasuke cuts him in half. Without immortality madara is dead 3 times there and naruto and sasuke don't have a scratch on them and haven't even used the bulk of their abilities. \n\nThere's no room to disagree. Its literally in the panels.  A complete one sided fight from start to finish and naruto and sasuke aren't even remotely worried until kaguya shows up. Where is the mid-high diff coming from if we haven't seen any evidence at all that madara can even hit them with a single attack?\n\nI feel like even you know that you're bullshitting here. The claim you're making is so far from what's shown and implied in the panels that I don't think you genuinely could believe it now that you've reread.",

I honestly don't think the kcm cloak is that much of a boost at this point.\n\n>Madara reacted was barely able to react to it.\n\nWould not call it barely. He had enough time to make the truth seeker orb change into a staff then grab said staff and move it to block naruto. That is definitely a clean reaction. \n\n>He was literally laying on the ground while immobilized and then absorbed the god tree.\n\nI mean i guess you could see it that way. To me it looked like he was chilling until the 10 tails spoke to him.\n\n>Then him and sasuke continue to just shit on a much stronger madara.\n\nIt's not exactly stated or shown how much the god tree buffs someone. Could be minor, could be alot. Plus the most that happened to madara in that scuffle was him being cut in half (looks like I'm making it sound like nothing, but madara really didn't seem to give a shit). And he literally tanked their rasengan and chidori combination, and still substituted a shadow and left it before they could touch him. Maybe he didn't win the skirmish, but he definitely wasn't shat on. Also i definitely remember Naruto getting swatted like a fly in that skirmish.\n\n>Then madara gets his other rinnegan and gets a massive power up again and naruto and sasuke still prove to be about equally as strong or stronger than him individually (naruto clones fight evenly with limbo clones. sasuke fights with him one on one).\n\nWdym \"and a power boost\" do you mean a power up from getting the second rinnegan. And when naruto fights madaras limbo, manga doesn't show any more than one square box of them in fight, but the anime makes naruto sound like he's struggling. At minimum narutos shadow clones are strong enough to not get steam rolled by the limbo, so I'll give him that.  Also what do you mean by sasuke. Sasuke doesn't interact with madara at all after he cuts him in half before madara kamuid.\n\n>I think realistically its a no diff for 6p kcm naruto if its pre god tree madara. That's not really wanking naruto either, that's just the very clear implication that kishimoto wanted to give. Madara needed 2 massive power ups to even fight with them semi evenly before they understand their powers fully.\n\nSo you genuinely think that kishimoto made the main character so much unfathomably stronger than the current antagonist. Does not make sense from a narrative perspective. \n\nThere is atleast 2 examples where naruto heavily implied that he couldn't take madara by himself. \n\nAfter madara gets the god tree he says to naruto that he can't take him down, then naruto goes \"I'm not gonna take you down, we are\"\n\nAnd while madara was in kamui getting his second, he literally says the answer to take madara down was teamwork. \n\nAlso madara had no idea what naruto and sasukes abilities were, so it cancels out. (They literally got 2 freebies on him with sasukes rinnegan) \n\nAlso I don't even think final form madara low diffs pre god tree madara, so i definitely don't naruto does.",

At minimum narutos shadow clones are strong enough to not get steam rolled by the limbo, so I'll give him that. Also what do you mean by sasuke. Sasuke doesn't interact with madara at all after he cuts him in half before madara kamuid.\n\nYes his rinnegan lets him summon multiple limbo clones stated to be relative to his strength. In the manga naruto takes them on and isn't shown to be losing. In the anime naruto doesn't seem to be losing either he's just fighting. There's no indication that he is losing the fight in either.\n\n>So you genuinely think that kishimoto made the main character so much unfathomably stronger than the current antagonist. Does not make sense from a narrative perspective.\n\nYes.. and that's not a weird concept either. Another one of the big 3 shounen does it against their big antagonist. Madara literally does not land a hit on them the entire fight while they would have killed anyone without that level of healing multiple times over. Kishimoto was trying to make it VERY clear that madara was nothing compared to them now.\n\n>After madara gets the god tree he says to naruto that he can't take him down, then naruto goes \"I'm not gonna take you down, we are\"\n\nThat does not imply that. That's just him iterating that him an sasuke are a team.\n\n>And while madara was in kamui getting his second, he literally says the answer to take madara down was teamwork\n\nYes because madara is able to fight semi evenly with double rinnegan. He still is clearly losing the fight but with all of his limbo clones and all the meteors he was able to stall them long enough to start the infinite tsukuyomi. The only reason one of them solo could not beat him is because they needed both of them to seal him and they weren't sure how to get around his immortality.\n\nSasuke and naruto don't know his abilities either. They learn about the limbo clones mid fight and still counter them easily.\n\nAnd of course double rinnegan madara low diffs pre god tree. Even if they were the same strength, double rinne madara has like 5 extra limbo clones that are stated to be similar in strength to the actual madara. But madara gets an extra rinnegan and a shit ton of chakra on top of that.\n\nIdk theres no implication that madara can actually fight evenly with them. Throughout the fight the only things they really are worried about is protecting the rest of the forces and actually getting him in a position to seal him. He can't hit them at all",

Naruto attacked head on a madara caught it right before it hit his chest.\n\nSounds like you're complimenting his reaction speed, the orbs aren't autopilot like obitos kamui. The only way this can become an argument is if you're trying to say that guys attack in that fight was moving faster than naruto was, which you clearly aren't. \n\nWhen naruto attacked madara, madara reacted to the attack, sent commands to change his truth seeking orbs shape, truth seeking orb changes it's shape (even if you think shape changing part happens instantly, madara still had to make it happen), then grabs it and pushes it into a position to block naruto. This is a clean reaction anyway you see it.\n\n\n\n>I think you should look at that panel again lol. \"Just chilling until the 10 tails spoke to him.\" He was literally scared the tree was falling and didn't move.\n\nDidn't or couldn't. Because he was injured, but not like \"i almost died you bastard\" injured. It's not like he couldn't move. \n\n>Madara literally states \"I'm basically immortal now\" after getting the tree. So its safe to say it was a large boost. We also know that it was sizeable because they say kaguya has more chakra than even another god tree on top madara. Neither of those statements make sense if it was just some mediocre power up.\n\nThey were referring to 10 tails, not the divine tree. And the divine tree has some amount of 10 tails chakra we just don't know how much, it's clearly not all of it, and they never say that obito was distinctively weaker without the tree. It gives him some amount of power and immortality.\n\n>Madara gets stabbed through the chest with effortlessly. Literally all of his attacks are dodged or blocked. He replaces himself with limbo to escape and he gets cut in half. They LITERALLY are no diffing him but don't know a way around his healing. I have no idea how you can say he wasn't shit on.\n\nLets see, madara launches the lightning style jutsu, naruto blocks it with TSB, naruto tries to attack madara, madara blocks it with limbo, madara uses fang of light, Naruto dodges it then madara hits him with the limbo clone and sends him flying to the floor.\n\nThis is kind of an L for Naruto.\n\nAt this point the edge goes to madara, seeing as how he was the only one to do damage.\n\nThen he tries to take sasukes eye and sasuke switches with the sword and he gets impaled. A bit of an L for madara, but there was literally no way he could see it coming. Plus honestly pre ten tails alive madara Could survive that impalement, even kakashi survived getting impaled by obito in their fight.\n\nAnd then at this point madara just wanted his other eye back.\n\nThen after that naruto and sasuke hit madara with their magnet style rasengan and six paths chidori, because of sasukes rinnegan, madara Could not only not see it coming, he literally couldn't do anything about it. Then he not only tanks their attack, he escapes it (the rasengan was literally made to seal his movements) and substitutes a shadow all before they can put their hands together and touch madara.\n\nBro this is a decently sized L for naruto and sasuke.\n\nThen madara just goes to get his other eye, and sasuke cuts him in half.\n\nA bit of an L for madara, but at this point he literally doesn't give a shit, he knows that sasuke can't kill him.\n\nLets see, 2 Ls for madara, 2 Ls for naruto. I'd say it was about even. Even if team naruto was winning, madara definitely was not getting shit on. If you still disagree, we'll just have to agree to disagree and end the convo. \n\n>Yes his rinnegan lets him summon multiple limbo clones stated to be relative to his strength.

There's no indication that he is losing the fight in either.\n\nIn the anime naruto sounds kinda annoyed and pissed off. Definitely does sound like he was atleast somewhat struggling.\n\nAnd the manga it doesn't show anyone winning or losing, maybe naruto was stomping the limbo, maybe he was going even. I don't want to make any conclusions, which is just why i gave him the minimum of not being stomped by the limbo which is still a nice feat. (Consider that the limbo are trying to attack the ones on the ground kakashi sakura and the real naruto, and narutos shadow clones are holding them off). \n\n\n>Yes.. and that's not a weird concept either. Another one of the big 3 shounen does it against their big antagonist. Madara literally does not land a hit on them the entire fight while they would have killed anyone without that level of healing multiple times over. Kishimoto was trying to make it VERY clear that madara was nothing compared to them now.\n\nI'm not sure you realise this, but 10 tails and onwards madara literally only lands one nice attack which was on the 4th hokage. After that he does not even land an attack on obito or kakashi or guy ect. Maybe we are reading the same story in a different lense, because I have never gotten the impression ever in my like 5 rewatches/rereads that naruto/sasuke were just leagues of madara.\n\nThe entire theme of the story in the war arc was indra and ashura working together to accomplish great stuff (it's literally written on the stone tablet, among the stuff that black zetsu revised)  The whole greater than the sum of its parts kinda thing. Which is why the sage gave half to naruto and half to sasuke, they needed eachother to beat madara, and I'm not just referring to the healing, the sage literally mentioned how strong madara was getting. \n\nIt wasn't implied to be like \"I've given half my power to the both of you, although naruto you can just go and stomp his ass by yourself\" because if that's how you see it, we really are reading 2 different series. \n\n>And of course double rinnegan madara low diffs pre god tree. Even if they were the same strength, double rinne madara has like 5 extra limbo clones that are stated to be similar in strength to the actual madara. But madara gets an extra rinnegan and a shit ton of chakra on top of that.\n\nI wasn't thinking of the limbo clone extension when i was talking about that, but just real madara vs real madara.",

He's able to react to 8th gate guy's surprise attacks with the same ability. Hes barely able to stop a straight forward punch from hitting him.\n\nThey were referring to 10 tails, not the divine tree. And the divine tree has some amount of 10 tails chakra we just don't know how much, it's clearly not all of it, and they never say that obito was distinctively weaker without the tree. It gives him some amount of power and immortality.\n\nWhat?  That is immediately after taking in the divine tree.\n\n>At this point the edge goes to madara, seeing as how he was the only one to do damage.\n\nHe didn't do any damage while naruto hurt the limbo that he still hadn't figured out yet..

Clear L for madara because all of his attacks were dodged and even his secret ability was found out in seconds.\n\n>Then after that naruto and sasuke hit madara with their magnet style rasengan and six paths chidori, because of sasukes rinnegan, madara Could not only not see it coming, he literally couldn't do anything about it. Then he not only tanks their attack, he escapes it (the rasengan was literally made to seal his movements) and substitutes a shadow all before they can put their hands together and touch madara.\n\n>Bro this is a decently sized L for naruto and sasuke.\n\n>Then madara just goes to get his other eye, and sasuke cuts him in half.\n\n>A bit of an L for madara, but at this point he literally doesn't give a shit, he knows that sasuke can't kill him\n\nOkay. You're trolling me. I'm done with this conversation lol that's the worst argument I've ever heard. \n\n>Madara runs for his life while getting the shit beat out of him and literally gets cut in half\n\n\"Decent sized  L for naruto and sasuke\"\n\nBruh. You just love madara. No other excuse for that kind of bad faith argument. Madara landed no hits the whole fight. He's just able to run and stall for time long enough to start the infinite Tsukuyomi",

And he still tanked it and left the fucking sealing rasengan before they could touch him. That is an L for Naruto anyway you see it.\n\nLol go ahead and be done with the convo, i will never convince you and you will never convince me. \n\nI mean seriously, naruto being >>>>>>>> madara at that point.

Madara lands 0 hits throughout multiple large power ups.\n\n\nYour whole argument relies on you misremembering the chapter/episodes and the idea that narratively they should not be much stronger. However, drop that headcanon and actually look at what happens and its clear that they are much stronger than madara individually.\n\nNo hits landed for madara. He's nearly killed by base 6p naruto pre god tree. He is literally chopped in half when he's running for his life. Gets another power up and still can't overpower them. You trying to say \"madara surprised naruto with an attack, that naruto dodged, and pushed naruto away is an big L\" is insanity. Madara literally landed nothing the whole fight and survived due to his hax limbo clones that they hadn't figured out yet.\n\nThis kind of power up is not close to unheard of in anime. Bleach does it, hxh does it, dragon ball does it all the time. Its often a cop out yes, but its well known kishimoto wrote himself into a corner. So he gave naruto and sasuke god like powers to kill the op boss he made.\n\nSo please stop responding with your headcanon and just reread the chapters",

No one is helping whatsoever.\n\nI was referring to madara in general, not specifically pre god tree madara. \n\nAnd i already said that I don't think naruto was slapping up pre god tree madara.\n\nAnd my main point in my original comment was that madara barely gets to interact with naruto and sasuke in any meaningful way. They do like 1 or 2 attacks at each other before it cuts away to madara doing something else.\n\nThey never get a proper extended fight like guy does, which is why i said kishimoto screwed over madara.",

He doesn't use force to break out. His limbo clone is stuck in there and naruto holds them.  \n\n>No the entire fight is madara trying to activate the infinite tsukiyomi, madara says atleast 2 times that he wants his eye back, after sasuke stabs him with the sword using the amenotejikara madara literally says that he needs his other eye (kudos to naruto and sasuke for making him feel that way, but it isn't confirmation that he's getting kurbstomped) then literally every single action he takes from that point is literally just him going to his eye.\n\nRight.... He totally doesn't fight them for a few minutes before running for his life after nearly getting sealed. He goes for his eye because he realizes he needs it to survive.\n\n>You are wanking the hell out of feats that aren't that major. The only feat that even resembles a no diff is sasuke cutting madara in half, but madara was literally immortal and didn't give a shit.\n\n>We are honestly going to have to agree to disagree, we have argued these same points over and over.\n\nNo. I am not.  The rasenshuriken leaves madara on the ground groaning in pain. He only has time to absorb the tree because naruto went to get guy.\n\nThen naruto and sasuke continue to dodge or block literally every single one of his attacks including surprise attacks (fang of light) and the limbo that they didn't know about yet. They stab him through the chest. They catch him in the sealing position and he uses substitution to escape. Then sasuke cuts him in half. Without immortality madara is dead 3 times there and naruto and sasuke don't have a scratch on them and haven't even used the bulk of their abilities. \n\nThere's no room to disagree. Its literally in the panels.  A complete one sided fight from start to finish and naruto and sasuke aren't even remotely worried until kaguya shows up. Where is the mid-high diff coming from if we haven't seen any evidence at all that madara can even hit them with a single attack?\n\nI feel like even you know that you're bullshitting here. The claim you're making is so far from what's shown and implied in the panels that I don't think you genuinely could believe it now that you've reread.",

            "body": ">Would not call it barely. He had enough time to make the truth seeker orb change into a staff then grab said staff and move it to block naruto. That is definitely a clean reaction.\n\nHe was able to change the truth seeking orb nearly instantly as seen in the guy fight. Guy was going for attacks from each side randomly to surprise madara and the orbs were able to keep up for the most part. Naruto attacked head on a madara caught it right before it hit his chest.\n\n>I mean i guess you could see it that way. To me it looked like he was chilling until the 10 tails spoke to him. \n\nI think you should look at that panel again lol. \"Just chilling until the 10 tails spoke to him.\" He was literally scared the tree was falling and didn't move.\n\n>It's not exactly stated or shown how much the god tree buffs someone. Could be minor, could be alot. \n\nMadara literally states \"I'm basically immortal now\" after getting the tree. So its safe to say it was a large boost. We also know that it was sizeable because they say kaguya has more chakra than even another god tree on top madara. Neither of those statements make sense if it was just some mediocre power up.\n\n>Plus the most that happened to madara in that scuffle was him being cut in half (looks like I'm making it sound like nothing, but madara really didn't seem to give a shit). And he literally tanked their rasengan and chidori combination, and still substituted a shadow and left it before they could touch him. Maybe he didn't win the skirmish, but he definitely wasn't shat on. Also i definitely remember Naruto getting swatted like a fly in that skirmish.\n\nMadara gets stabbed through the chest with effortlessly. Literally all of his attacks are dodged or blocked. He replaces himself with limbo to escape and he gets cut in half. They LITERALLY are no diffing him but don't know a way around his healing. I have no idea how you can say he wasn't shit on.\n\n>Wdym \"and a power boost\" do you mean a power up from getting the second rinnegan. And when naruto fights madaras limbo, manga doesn't show any more than one square box of them in fight, but the anime makes naruto sound like he's struggling. At minimum narutos shadow clones are strong enough to not get steam rolled by the limbo, so I'll give him that. Also what do you mean by sasuke. Sasuke doesn't interact with madara at all after he cuts him in half before madara kamuid.\n\nYes his rinnegan lets him summon multiple limbo clones stated to be relative to his strength. In the manga naruto takes them on and isn't shown to be losing. In the anime naruto doesn't seem to be losing either he's just fighting. There's no indication that he is losing the fight in either.\n\n>So you genuinely think that kishimoto made the main character so much unfathomably stronger than the current antagonist. Does not make sense from a narrative perspective.\n\nYes.. and that's not a weird concept either. Another one of the big 3 shounen does it against their big antagonist. Madara literally does not land a hit on them the entire fight while they would have killed anyone without that level of healing multiple times over. Kishimoto was trying to make it VERY clear that madara was nothing compared to them now.\n\n>After madara gets the god tree he says to naruto that he can't take him down, then naruto goes \"I'm not gonna take you down, we are\"\n\nThat does not imply that. That's just him iterating that him an sasuke are a team.\n\n>And while madara was in kamui getting his second, he literally says the answer to take madara down was teamwork\n\nYes because madara is able to fight semi evenly with double rinnegan. He still is clearly losing the fight but with all of his limbo clones and all the meteors he was able to stall them long enough to start the infinite tsukuyomi. The only reason one of them solo could not beat him is because they needed both of them to seal him and they weren't sure how to get around his immortality.\n\nSasuke and naruto don't know his abilities either. They learn about the limbo clones mid fight and still counter them easily.\n\nAnd of course double rinnegan madara low diffs pre god tree. Even if they were the same strength, double rinne madara has like 5 extra limbo clones that are stated to be similar in strength to the actual madara. But madara gets an extra rinnegan and a shit ton of chakra on top of that.\n\nIdk theres no implication that madara can actually fight evenly with them. Throughout the fight the only things they really are worried about is protecting the rest of the forces and actually getting him in a position to seal him. He can't hit them at all",

The only way this can become an argument is if you're trying to say that guys attack in that fight was moving faster than naruto was, which you clearly aren't. \n\nWhen naruto attacked madara, madara reacted to the attack, sent commands to change his truth seeking orbs shape, truth seeking orb changes it's shape (even if you think shape changing part happens instantly, madara still had to make it happen), then grabs it and pushes it into a position to block naruto. This is a clean reaction anyway you see it.\n\n\n\n>I think you should look at that panel again lol. \"Just chilling until the 10 tails spoke to him.\" He was literally scared the tree was falling and didn't move.\n\nDidn't or couldn't.

And the divine tree has some amount of 10 tails chakra we just don't know how much, it's clearly not all of it, and they never say that obito was distinctively weaker without the tree. It gives him some amount of power and immortality.\n\n>Madara gets stabbed through the chest with effortlessly. Literally all of his attacks are dodged or blocked. He replaces himself with limbo to escape and he gets cut in half. They LITERALLY are no diffing him but don't know a way around his healing. I have no idea how you can say he wasn't shit on.\n\nLets see, madara launches the lightning style jutsu, naruto blocks it with TSB, naruto tries to attack madara, madara blocks it with limbo, madara uses fang of light, Naruto dodges it then madara hits him with the limbo clone and sends him flying to the floor.\n\nThis is kind of an L for Naruto.\n\nAt this point the edge goes to madara, seeing as how he was the only one to do damage.\n\nThen he tries to take sasukes eye and sasuke switches with the sword and he gets impaled. A bit of an L for madara, but there was literally no way he could see it coming. Plus honestly pre ten tails alive madara Could survive that impalement, even kakashi survived getting impaled by obito in their fight.\n\nAnd then at this point madara just wanted his other eye back.\n\nThen after that naruto and sasuke hit madara with their magnet style rasengan and six paths chidori, because of sasukes rinnegan, madara Could not only not see it coming, he literally couldn't do anything about it. Then he not only tanks their attack, he escapes it (the rasengan was literally made to seal his movements) and substitutes a shadow all before they can put their hands together and touch madara.\n\nBro this is a decently sized L for naruto and sasuke.\n\nThen madara just goes to get his other eye, and sasuke cuts him in half.\n\nA bit of an L for madara, but at this point he literally doesn't give a shit, he knows that sasuke can't kill him.\n\nLets see, 2 Ls for madara, 2 Ls for naruto. I'd say it was about even. Even if team naruto was winning, madara definitely was not getting shit on. If you still disagree, we'll just have to agree to disagree and end the convo. \n\n>Yes his rinnegan lets him summon multiple limbo clones stated to be relative to his strength. In the manga naruto takes them on and isn't shown to be losing. In the anime naruto doesn't seem to be losing either he's just fighting. There's no indication that he is losing the fight in either.\n\nIn the anime naruto sounds kinda annoyed and pissed off. Definitely does sound like he was atleast somewhat struggling.\n\nAnd the manga it doesn't show anyone winning or losing, maybe naruto was stomping the limbo, maybe he was going even. I don't want to make any conclusions, which is just why i gave him the minimum of not being stomped by the limbo which is still a nice feat. (Consider that the limbo are trying to attack the ones on the ground kakashi sakura and the real naruto, and narutos shadow clones are holding them off). \n\n\n>Yes.. and that's not a weird concept either.

Madara literally does not land a hit on them the entire fight while they would have killed anyone without that level of healing multiple times over. Kishimoto was trying to make it VERY clear that madara was nothing compared to them now.\n\nI'm not sure you realise this, but 10 tails and onwards madara literally only lands one nice attack which was on the 4th hokage. After that he does not even land an attack on obito or kakashi or guy ect. Maybe we are reading the same story in a different lense, because I have never gotten the impression ever in my like 5 rewatches/rereads that naruto/sasuke were just leagues of madara.\n\nThe entire theme of the story in the war arc was indra and ashura working together to accomplish great stuff (it's literally written on the stone tablet, among the stuff that black zetsu revised)  The whole greater than the sum of its parts kinda thing. Which is why the sage gave half to naruto and half to sasuke, they needed eachother to beat madara, and I'm not just referring to the healing, the sage literally mentioned how strong madara was getting. \n\nIt wasn't implied to be like \"I've given half my power to the both of you, although naruto you can just go and stomp his ass by yourself\" because if that's how you see it, we really are reading 2 different series. \n\n>And of course double rinnegan madara low diffs pre god tree. Even if they were the same strength, double rinne madara has like 5 extra limbo clones that are stated to be similar in strength to the actual madara.

However, drop that headcanon and actually look at what happens and its clear that they are much stronger than madara individually.\n\nNo hits landed for madara. He's nearly killed by base 6p naruto pre god tree. He is literally chopped in half when he's running for his life. Gets another power up and still can't overpower them. You trying to say \"madara surprised naruto with an attack, that naruto dodged, and pushed naruto away is an big L\" is insanity. Madara literally landed nothing the whole fight and survived due to his hax limbo clones that they hadn't figured out yet.\n\nThis kind of power up is not close to unheard of in anime. Bleach does it, hxh does it, dragon ball does it all the time. Its often a cop out yes, but its well known kishimoto wrote himself into a corner.

The rasenshuriken leaves madara on the ground groaning in pain. He only has time to absorb the tree because naruto went to get guy.\n\nThen naruto and sasuke continue to dodge or block literally every single one of his attacks including surprise attacks (fang of light) and the limbo that they didn't know about yet. They stab him through the chest. They catch him in the sealing position and he uses substitution to escape. Then sasuke cuts him in half. Without immortality madara is dead 3 times there and naruto and sasuke don't have a scratch on them and haven't even used the bulk of their abilities. \n\nThere's no room to disagree. Its literally in the panels.  A complete one sided fight from start to finish and naruto and sasuke aren't even remotely worried until kaguya shows up. Where is the mid-high diff coming from if we haven't seen any evidence at all that madara can even hit them with a single attack?\n\nI feel like even you know that you're bullshitting here. The claim you're making is so far from what's shown and implied in the panels that I don't think you genuinely could believe it now that you've reread.",

            "body": ">He was able to change the truth seeking orb nearly instantly as seen in the guy fight. Guy was going for attacks from each side randomly to surprise madara and the orbs were able to keep up for the most part. Naruto attacked head on a madara caught it right before it hit his chest.\n\nSounds like you're complimenting his reaction speed, the orbs aren't autopilot like obitos kamui. The only way this can become an argument is if you're trying to say that guys attack in that fight was moving faster than naruto was, which you clearly aren't. \n\nWhen naruto attacked madara, madara reacted to the attack, sent commands to change his truth seeking orbs shape, truth seeking orb changes it's shape (even if you think shape changing part happens instantly, madara still had to make it happen), then grabs it and pushes it into a position to block naruto. This is a clean reaction anyway you see it.\n\n\n\n>I think you should look at that panel again lol. \"Just chilling until the 10 tails spoke to him.\" He was literally scared the tree was falling and didn't move.\n\nDidn't or couldn't. Because he was injured, but not like \"i almost died you bastard\" injured. It's not like he couldn't move. \n\n>Madara literally states \"I'm basically immortal now\" after getting the tree. So its safe to say it was a large boost. We also know that it was sizeable because they say kaguya has more chakra than even another god tree on top madara. Neither of those statements make sense if it was just some mediocre power up.\n\nThey were referring to 10 tails, not the divine tree. And the divine tree has some amount of 10 tails chakra we just don't know how much, it's clearly not all of it, and they never say that obito was distinctively weaker without the tree. It gives him some amount of power and immortality.\n\n>Madara gets stabbed through the chest with effortlessly. Literally all of his attacks are dodged or blocked. He replaces himself with limbo to escape and he gets cut in half. They LITERALLY are no diffing him but don't know a way around his healing. I have no idea how you can say he wasn't shit on.\n\nLets see, madara launches the lightning style jutsu, naruto blocks it with TSB, naruto tries to attack madara, madara blocks it with limbo, madara uses fang of light, Naruto dodges it then madara hits him with the limbo clone and sends him flying to the floor.\n\nThis is kind of an L for Naruto.\n\nAt this point the edge goes to madara, seeing as how he was the only one to do damage.\n\nThen he tries to take sasukes eye and sasuke switches with the sword and he gets impaled. A bit of an L for madara, but there was literally no way he could see it coming. Plus honestly pre ten tails alive madara Could survive that impalement, even kakashi survived getting impaled by obito in their fight.\n\nAnd then at this point madara just wanted his other eye back.\n\nThen after that naruto and sasuke hit madara with their magnet style rasengan and six paths chidori, because of sasukes rinnegan, madara Could not only not see it coming, he literally couldn't do anything about it. Then he not only tanks their attack, he escapes it (the rasengan was literally made to seal his movements) and substitutes a shadow all before they can put their hands together and touch madara.\n\nBro this is a decently sized L for naruto and sasuke.\n\nThen madara just goes to get his other eye, and sasuke cuts him in half.\n\nA bit of an L for madara, but at this point he literally doesn't give a shit, he knows that sasuke can't kill him.\n\nLets see, 2 Ls for madara, 2 Ls for naruto. I'd say it was about even. Even if team naruto was winning, madara definitely was not getting shit on. If you still disagree, we'll just have to agree to disagree and end the convo. \n\n>Yes his rinnegan lets him summon multiple limbo clones stated to be relative to his strength. In the manga naruto takes them on and isn't shown to be losing. In the anime naruto doesn't seem to be losing either he's just fighting. There's no indication that he is losing the fight in either.\n\nIn the anime naruto sounds kinda annoyed and pissed off. Definitely does sound like he was atleast somewhat struggling.\n\nAnd the manga it doesn't show anyone winning or losing, maybe naruto was stomping the limbo, maybe he was going even. I don't want to make any conclusions, which is just why i gave him the minimum of not being stomped by the limbo which is still a nice feat. (Consider that the limbo are trying to attack the ones on the ground kakashi sakura and the real naruto, and narutos shadow clones are holding them off). \n\n\n>Yes.. and that's not a weird concept either. Another one of the big 3 shounen does it against their big antagonist. Madara literally does not land a hit on them the entire fight while they would have killed anyone without that level of healing multiple times over. Kishimoto was trying to make it VERY clear that madara was nothing compared to them now.\n\nI'm not sure you realise this, but 10 tails and onwards madara literally only lands one nice attack which was on the 4th hokage. After that he does not even land an attack on obito or kakashi or guy ect. Maybe we are reading the same story in a different lense, because I have never gotten the impression ever in my like 5 rewatches/rereads that naruto/sasuke were just leagues of madara.\n\nThe entire theme of the story in the war arc was indra and ashura working together to accomplish great stuff (it's literally written on the stone tablet, among the stuff that black zetsu revised)  The whole greater than the sum of its parts kinda thing. Which is why the sage gave half to naruto and half to sasuke, they needed eachother to beat madara, and I'm not just referring to the healing, the sage literally mentioned how strong madara was getting. \n\nIt wasn't implied to be like \"I've given half my power to the both of you, although naruto you can just go and stomp his ass by yourself\" because if that's how you see it, we really are reading 2 different series. \n\n>And of course double rinnegan madara low diffs pre god tree. Even if they were the same strength, double rinne madara has like 5 extra limbo clones that are stated to be similar in strength to the actual madara. But madara gets an extra rinnegan and a shit ton of chakra on top of that.\n\nI wasn't thinking of the limbo clone extension when i was talking about that, but just real madara vs real madara.",

You just love madara. No other excuse for that kind of bad faith argument. Madara landed no hits the whole fight.

Narutos lava rasenshuriken renders him immobilized nearly dead on the ground. He's bleeding from his mouth hurt badly laying on his back.\n\nMadara says that line IMMEDIATELY after absorbing the god tree. You misremembered when it happens.\n\nYour whole argument hinges on the basis that narratively naruto shouldn't be stronger. Drop that and look at the actual fight. Madara lands 0 hits throughout multiple large power ups.\n\n\nYour whole argument relies on you misremembering the chapter/episodes and the idea that narratively they should not be much stronger. However, drop that headcanon and actually look at what happens and its clear that they are much stronger than madara individually.\n\nNo hits landed for madara. He's nearly killed by base 6p naruto pre god tree. He is literally chopped in half when he's running for his life. Gets another power up and still can't overpower them. You trying to say \"madara surprised naruto with an attack, that naruto dodged, and pushed naruto away is an big L\" is insanity. Madara literally landed nothing the whole fight and survived due to his hax limbo clones that they hadn't figured out yet.\n\nThis kind of power up is not close to unheard of in anime. Bleach does it, hxh does it, dragon ball does it all the time. Its often a cop out yes, but its well known kishimoto wrote himself into a corner. So he gave naruto and sasuke god like powers to kill the op boss he made.\n\nSo please stop responding with your headcanon and just reread the chapters",

Narutos lava rasenshuriken renders him immobilized nearly dead on the ground. He's bleeding from his mouth hurt badly laying on his back.\r  \n\r\n\nits one panel of him laying down, how do you even know hes immobilized, and hes bleeding from the mouth from the kick guy did, which you still forget that madara was literally almost dead from guy right when naruto came in, the only visible injury from the rasenshuriken is some sort of tear on his abdomen, you cant see much since its just ripped clothes.\n\nmy argument isnt just narrative. none of the feats suggest that madara is somehow far weaker than naruto and sasuke, none of the little fights they did had madara getting shit on. \n\nmadaras main goal was literally to get his other rinnegan back, that is all, after he escaped naruto and sasukes rasen chidori clash (which he litearlly fully tanked btw) he literally makes a B line straight to kakashis eye to get his rinnegan, lmao he was not running for his life. infact naruto and sasuke straight up fail twice at stopping the infinite tsukiyomi (they didnt stop madara from getting his eye, and they didnt stop him from launching the jutsu).\n\n>You trying to say \"madara surprised naruto with an attack, that naruto dodged, and pushed naruto away is an big L\" is insanity\n\ni didnt say it was a big L for naruto, i just said that at worst it was an even trade.\n\nthe big L was madara tanking and escaping naruto and sasukes rasen chidori clash before they can touch him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand madara doesnt land an attack on guy either, so i guess guy  >>>>>>>>>>>> madara according to you.\n\njust because it makes narrative sense in other arcs of other anime doesnt mean it makes narrative sense in this arc of this series.\n\nyou acknowledge that kishimoto made madara op, but you think kishimotos answer to this is to make naruto and sasuke not only as op as he is (which sure i agree) but far more ( which i disagree ).\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni can do the maths of it, base madara \u2248 kcm2 naruto. so therefore base madara + complete 10 tails and six paths > kcm2 naruto + piece of each tailed beast and six paths.\n\nor i could do it differently, the sage said that madara was getting close to him in power, so madara was about 80% of hagoromo (definetly above 50% otherwise his line wouldnt be relevant), and then the sage gave naruto 50% even if narutos base is some significant % of the sage, he definetly isnt gonna turn into like 200% of the sage.\n\nanyway i look at it, naruto isnt stomping 10 tails madara, not feats wise, not narratively, not even scaling wise. \n\nalso lol what is that link.",

The rasenshuriken leaves madara on the ground groaning in pain. He only has time to absorb the tree because naruto went to get guy.\n\nThen naruto and sasuke continue to dodge or block literally every single one of his attacks including surprise attacks (fang of light) and the limbo that they didn't know about yet. They stab him through the chest. They catch him in the sealing position and he uses substitution to escape. Then sasuke cuts him in half. Without immortality madara is dead 3 times there and naruto and sasuke don't have a scratch on them and haven't even used the bulk of their abilities. \n\nThere's no room to disagree. Its literally in the panels.  A complete one sided fight from start to finish and naruto and sasuke aren't even remotely worried until kaguya shows up.

He's able to react to 8th gate guy's surprise attacks with the same ability. Hes barely able to stop a straight forward punch from hitting him.\n\nThey were referring to 10 tails, not the divine tree. And the divine tree has some amount of 10 tails chakra we just don't know how much, it's clearly not all of it, and they never say that obito was distinctively weaker without the tree. It gives him some amount of power and immortality.\n\nWhat?  That is immediately after taking in the divine tree.\n\n>At this point the edge goes to madara, seeing as how he was the only one to do damage.\n\nHe didn't do any damage while naruto hurt the limbo that he still hadn't figured out yet.. All he did was push the rod away that naruto was hanging on to. Clear L for madara because all of his attacks were dodged and even his secret ability was found out in seconds.\n\n>Then after that naruto and sasuke hit madara with their magnet style rasengan and six paths chidori, because of sasukes rinnegan, madara Could not only not see it coming, he literally couldn't do anything about it. Then he not only tanks their attack, he escapes it (the rasengan was literally made to seal his movements) and substitutes a shadow all before they can put their hands together and touch madara.\n\n>Bro this is a decently sized L for naruto and sasuke.\n\n>Then madara just goes to get his other eye, and sasuke cuts him in half.\n\n>A bit of an L for madara, but at this point he literally doesn't give a shit, he knows that sasuke can't kill him\n\nOkay. You're trolling me. I'm done with this conversation lol that's the worst argument I've ever heard. \n\n>Madara runs for his life while getting the shit beat out of him and literally gets cut in half\n\n\"Decent sized  L for naruto and sasuke\"\n\nBruh. You just love madara. No other excuse for that kind of bad faith argument. Madara landed no hits the whole fight. He's just able to run and stall for time long enough to start the infinite Tsukuyomi",

And he still tanked it and left the fucking sealing rasengan before they could touch him. That is an L for Naruto anyway you see it.\n\nLol go ahead and be done with the convo, i will never convince you and you will never convince me. \n\nI mean seriously, naruto being >>>>>>>> madara at that point.

You misremembered when it happens.\n\nYour whole argument hinges on the basis that narratively naruto shouldn't be stronger. Drop that and look at the actual fight. Madara lands 0 hits throughout multiple large power ups.\n\n\nYour whole argument relies on you misremembering the chapter/episodes and the idea that narratively they should not be much stronger. However, drop that headcanon and actually look at what happens and its clear that they are much stronger than madara individually.\n\nNo hits landed for madara. He's nearly killed by base 6p naruto pre god tree. He is literally chopped in half when he's running for his life. Gets another power up and still can't overpower them. You trying to say \"madara surprised naruto with an attack, that naruto dodged, and pushed naruto away is an big L\" is insanity. Madara literally landed nothing the whole fight and survived due to his hax limbo clones that they hadn't figured out yet.\n\nThis kind of power up is not close to unheard of in anime. Bleach does it, hxh does it, dragon ball does it all the time. Its often a cop out yes, but its well known kishimoto wrote himself into a corner. So he gave naruto and sasuke god like powers to kill the op boss he made.\n\nSo please stop responding with your headcanon and just reread the chapters",

They say kaguya is greater than another god tree added onto madara. Sasuke is so scared by that amount of chakra that he is surprised someone that strong could have ever existed. That was just being completely unfazed by seeing madara at his full strength. So clearly using the god tree to be relative to that power up means that it is an IMMENSE power up.\n\nWe can say that confidently because they continue to get stronger without the seals containing the chakra (valley of the end, the last, boruto etc)",

They say kaguya is greater than another god tree added onto madara. Sasuke is so scared by that amount of chakra that he is surprised someone that strong could have ever existed. That was just being completely unfazed by seeing madara at his full strength. So clearly using the god tree to be relative to that power up means that it is an IMMENSE power up.\n\nwrong again, and you are the one telling me to read the manga\n\n[https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Naruto/0679-003.png](https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Naruto/0679-003.png)\n\nliterally says the 10 tails. even the anime says the 10 tails.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>We can say that confidently because they continue to get stronger without the seals containing the chakra (valley of the end, the last, boruto etc)\r  \n\r\n\nwhat exactly does that sentence have to do with the previous paragraph.",

He totally doesn't fight them for a few minutes before running for his life after nearly getting sealed.

The rasenshuriken leaves madara on the ground groaning in pain. He only has time to absorb the tree because naruto went to get guy.\n\nThen naruto and sasuke continue to dodge or block literally every single one of his attacks including surprise attacks (fang of light) and the limbo that they didn't know about yet. They stab him through the chest. They catch him in the sealing position and he uses substitution to escape. Then sasuke cuts him in half. Without immortality madara is dead 3 times there and naruto and sasuke don't have a scratch on them and haven't even used the bulk of their abilities. \n\nThere's no room to disagree. Its literally in the panels.  A complete one sided fight from start to finish and naruto and sasuke aren't even remotely worried until kaguya shows up. Where is the mid-high diff coming from if we haven't seen any evidence at all that madara can even hit them with a single attack?\n\nI feel like even you know that you're bullshitting here.

Compare that to literal teleportation, ofcourse Naruto and sasuke are gonna have an easier time first timing compared to madara. \n\nAnd he swatted naruto like a fly, i do give naruto props for sticking the landing. The most i can give this is an even, madara definitely didn't take an L. \n\n>Okay. You're trolling me. I'm done with this conversation lol that's the worst argument I've ever heard\n\nYou are coping so hard if you do not think it's an L for naruto and sasuke, they literally hit him with a free attack that he could not see coming nor do anything about, a literal sealing attack aswell. And he still tanked it and left the fucking sealing rasengan before they could touch him. That is an L for Naruto anyway you see it.\n\nLol go ahead and be done with the convo, i will never convince you and you will never convince me. \n\nI mean seriously, naruto being >>>>>>>> madara at that point.

Madara lands 0 hits throughout multiple large power ups.\n\n\nYour whole argument relies on you misremembering the chapter/episodes and the idea that narratively they should not be much stronger. However, drop that headcanon and actually look at what happens and its clear that they are much stronger than madara individually.\n\nNo hits landed for madara. He's nearly killed by base 6p naruto pre god tree. He is literally chopped in half when he's running for his life. Gets another power up and still can't overpower them. You trying to say \"madara surprised naruto with an attack, that naruto dodged, and pushed naruto away is an big L\" is insanity. Madara literally landed nothing the whole fight and survived due to his hax limbo clones that they hadn't figured out yet.\n\nThis kind of power up is not close to unheard of in anime. Bleach does it, hxh does it, dragon ball does it all the time. Its often a cop out yes, but its well known kishimoto wrote himself into a corner. So he gave naruto and sasuke god like powers to kill the op boss he made.\n\nSo please stop responding with your headcanon and just reread the chapters",

Where is the mid-high diff coming from if we haven't seen any evidence at all that madara can even hit them with a single attack?\n\nI feel like even you know that you're bullshitting here. The claim you're making is so far from what's shown and implied in the panels that I don't think you genuinely could believe it now that you've reread.",

Madara lands 0 hits throughout multiple large power ups.\n\n\nYour whole argument relies on you misremembering the chapter/episodes and the idea that narratively they should not be much stronger. However, drop that headcanon and actually look at what happens and its clear that they are much stronger than madara individually.\n\nNo hits landed for madara. He's nearly killed by base 6p naruto pre god tree. He is literally chopped in half when he's running for his life. Gets another power up and still can't overpower them. You trying to say \"madara surprised naruto with an attack, that naruto dodged, and pushed naruto away is an big L\" is insanity. Madara literally landed nothing the whole fight and survived due to his hax limbo clones that they hadn't figured out yet.\n\nThis kind of power up is not close to unheard of in anime. Bleach does it, hxh does it, dragon ball does it all the time. Its often a cop out yes, but its well known kishimoto wrote himself into a corner. So he gave naruto and sasuke god like powers to kill the op boss he made.\n\nSo please stop responding with your headcanon and just reread the chapters",

The whole point kishimoto was conveying is that naruto has far surpassed even madara now. The whole thing until madara activates his rinnesharingan is literally just feats for naruto and sasuke showing their new abilities, their speed, their attack power, etc. They dodge or block literally every attack and hit madara with almost everything except the first few attacks where they're learning how his limbo works.\n\nThe entire fight is just him running for his life and getting beat up and healing in the process. He wouldn't have survived multiple chapters, thats why it was made a quick and easy fight for them so kishimoto could  show the real final enemy. The entire time its just madara saying something cocky, getting hit, then saying \"how could they do that\", getting a new power up, and repeat.\n\nIt wasn't supposed to be ambiguous. You really have to be trying your best to wank madara to say he would even lose high diff to them solo.\n\nKcm 6p naruto no or very low diffs pre god tree madara. Even worse if he used the abilties he learned later like his truth seeking orbs, boil release, asura chakra mode, etc",

The rasenshuriken leaves madara on the ground groaning in pain. He only has time to absorb the tree because naruto went to get guy.\n\nThen naruto and sasuke continue to dodge or block literally every single one of his attacks including surprise attacks (fang of light) and the limbo that they didn't know about yet. They stab him through the chest. They catch him in the sealing position and he uses substitution to escape. Then sasuke cuts him in half. Without immortality madara is dead 3 times there and naruto and sasuke don't have a scratch on them and haven't even used the bulk of their abilities. \n\nThere's no room to disagree. Its literally in the panels.  A complete one sided fight from start to finish and naruto and sasuke aren't even remotely worried until kaguya shows up.

He doesn't use force to break out. His limbo clone is stuck in there and naruto holds them.  \n\n>No the entire fight is madara trying to activate the infinite tsukiyomi, madara says atleast 2 times that he wants his eye back, after sasuke stabs him with the sword using the amenotejikara madara literally says that he needs his other eye (kudos to naruto and sasuke for making him feel that way, but it isn't confirmation that he's getting kurbstomped) then literally every single action he takes from that point is literally just him going to his eye.\n\nRight.... He totally doesn't fight them for a few minutes before running for his life after nearly getting sealed. He goes for his eye because he realizes he needs it to survive.\n\n>You are wanking the hell out of feats that aren't that major. The only feat that even resembles a no diff is sasuke cutting madara in half, but madara was literally immortal and didn't give a shit.\n\n>We are honestly going to have to agree to disagree, we have argued these same points over and over.\n\nNo. I am not.  The rasenshuriken leaves madara on the ground groaning in pain. He only has time to absorb the tree because naruto went to get guy.\n\nThen naruto and sasuke continue to dodge or block literally every single one of his attacks including surprise attacks (fang of light) and the limbo that they didn't know about yet. They stab him through the chest. They catch him in the sealing position and he uses substitution to escape. Then sasuke cuts him in half. Without immortality madara is dead 3 times there and naruto and sasuke don't have a scratch on them and haven't even used the bulk of their abilities. \n\nThere's no room to disagree. Its literally in the panels.  A complete one sided fight from start to finish and naruto and sasuke aren't even remotely worried until kaguya shows up. Where is the mid-high diff coming from if we haven't seen any evidence at all that madara can even hit them with a single attack?\n\nI feel like even you know that you're bullshitting here.

We know this because he literally slaps him around before powering up and then continues to slap him around after both of them power up\r  \n\r\n\nwe will keep disagreeing on this point, because i do not agree that it was \"a slap up\". the highlight of the scuffle was narutos rasenshuriken which definetly was not shown to almost kill him or anything like guy did, and madara at that point didnt even properly heal after almost dying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Naruto and sasuke weren't purely strong from the sage's chakra. The seals on the hand were 50% of his chakra and that was used mostly for sealing kaguya. six path sage mode was from having all 9 tailed beasts in naruto. Rinnegan was from either getting hagoromos chakra or from hashirama cells, its unclear but hashirama cells is the only was its happened in the past so probably that.\r  \n\r\n\nwhat no, hagoromo does give him power not just in the seals. and even if you were correct, it would benefit my argument even more, narutos power up coming from the bits of chakra from the tailed beasts while madara had the complete 10 tails. \n\n>Also another thing I missed about the god tree. They say kaguya is greater than another god tree added onto madara. Sasuke is so scared by that amount of chakra that he is surprised someone that strong could have ever existed. That was just being completely unfazed by seeing madara at his full strength. So clearly using the god tree to be relative to that power up means that it is an IMMENSE power up.\n\nwrong again, and you are the one telling me to read the manga\n\n[https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Naruto/0679-003.png](https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Naruto/0679-003.png)\n\nliterally says the 10 tails. even the anime says the 10 tails.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>We can say that confidently because they continue to get stronger without the seals containing the chakra (valley of the end, the last, boruto etc)\r  \n\r\n\nwhat exactly does that sentence have to do with the previous paragraph.",
