    "body": "I\u2019ve recently made a return back to the bowl and someone sent me a quick message to \u201cread their profile,\u201d and to text them if I was interested. For their about me they had about a sentence of just one worded vague traits(articulate, athletic, nature, tech) that told me nothing about them. A majority of the few traits had something to do with money. I really can\u2019t find out much about someone off of 15 words.\n\nHowever for the Seeking section, it turns out they did have some writing skills! The first sentence comments on how \u201cmost women on here have to be kidding if they think they\u2019re hot.\u201d Spectacular start. In 8 paragraphs he wrote exactly what he was seeking! How most girls are not attractive, liars, and stupid! He also does not wait in line and holds interviews but getting an interview does not mean someone is accepted or not. \n\nThe girls also must be naturally attractive and he isn\u2019t into sloppy seconds, thirds, or hundreds. He knows the difference between fresh untapped and these girls, \u201cMust pass interview and inspection.\u201d Are we cars? He just blocked me because I mentioned how I\u2019d rather know more about his hobbies then read about his utter disregard for women. God. I always forget when I reenter the bowl again how loaded up the misogyny is on seeking. Please look at women as people.",

I love treating a lady like a lady (and person) once I know that I'm not viewed as a mark / target for a scam.\n\nYour guy didn't ask for money at least which about half SB's do now before you even meet which is a hard no for me. Also against site rules.   I'm much, much wiser and cautious now because I've come across so many career criminal SB's on there over the last 30 months. One of whom is in prison for felony fraud, attempted blackmail, theft, and property damage and multiple victims were involved.  That's a bit more serious than a guy just being weird, misogynistic, and intense.  I can unequivocally say that while there are male scammers out there, if SB's don't realize that any time a SD asks for any kind of bank info, gift card, or even a nickel to be honest, something is wrong and you walk away.  Period.  Generally speaking a SD will figure out if a SB is doing something shady pretty quickly.  Most of us are businessmen and have the means, connections, and definitely the motivation to make sure that doesn't happen to anyone else.  Plus if they're doing it to multiple people it's not hard to figure out.  Not wise moves in the Bowl\n\nBy no means am I complaining about women here, I'm venting about the criminals on there who are ok with making an entire living by attempting to rob men.  It doesn't end well and makes SD's skeptical of all of the real SB's making your lives harder!  It should be so simple if you get along, but I'm seeing about half of the SA posts now being 2-5 days old, too good to be true and then they want money before meeting.  So about half the chicks on SA are fakes / frauds (at least in my city).",
