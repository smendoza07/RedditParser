    "body": "So let me start out by saying that I've been seeing this man for quite some time. He's very hard working and generous, but can be incredibly self absorbed and childish at times, particularly when he drinks. He also has difficulty making plans that are not day of/last minute, which I have taken issue with and have tried to politely set boundaries in regards to this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nANYWHOOOO. He's been asking me to go to dinner all week long, and I told him early on that I would be very busy all week with work and family. We made plans to go out Thursday after I was done with family lake day. I ended up being too tired to go out so we just doordashed n chilled. Great food, sex, stand up comedy, everything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday he again asks to go to dinner. I'm working all day, but I agree. What I meant to tell him is that I cant stay with him tonight. What I actually said was that I can't be up late. A minute but mountain of a detail in events to come.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt dinner he begins to talk about what we're doing after, and I remind him that I can't be up late. I'd like to just go home. Well.... he starts pitching the mother of all bitch fits. I mean he's spearing his salad like a cave man, elbows on the table, looking like a baby with a popped balloon. I immediately apologize about the miscommunication. Because he chose to make plans the day of I was texting him from work and didn't send the entirety of my commitment to said evening.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nApparently he didn't want an apology. He just wanted to be a fucking child, and talk down to me for being so \"inconsiderate.\" About this time I had about enough of him accosting the appetizers and gaslighting me, so I went into full on you-will-stop-this-childish-behavior-right-now-young-man-or-so-help-me mode. I told him thru gritted teeth that he was being self-absorbed, hurtful, rude, and embarrassing. To which he responded, \"Yeah, well maybe you are too.\" I was not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI then threatened to leave, he calmed down, then started back at again, I'm really going to leave now, he says, \"No I'm leaving, you got the tab.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAND HE LEAVES. I have several hundred dollars worth of food now. Yay. Literally a day and a half's pay for me down the hole. Lesson learned.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFriends, keep an eye out for those red flags. They are red for a reason. smdh\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Guys he left his credit card at my house. He frequently lets me use it for shopping so it isn't unusual for me to have it. I would never use it without persmission... right?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Some things to add that I said in the comments\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo after he stormed off,  he called my phone about 5 times (rejected) then comes back about ten minutes later. He sat down and before he could speak I said, \"This is all my food now. You can go.\"\n\nMy dignity is not a worth a damn dinner.\n\nI used my own money to pay. His card was at my house. I'm thinking of sending him the world's biggest dildo and a penis pump. Let me know if you think of anything else.\n\nWe've been together 5 ish months, though I've known a few of his friends for 10+ years. He's very good to me most of the time, but his drinking is problematic. He'd been out on his boat all day so he showed up late and apparently pretty lit. Unfortunately I didn't realize this till after we got to the restaurant.\n\nAs for the cc, it's not mine, but he gives it to me to use pretty regularly. Like I said, he can be very sweet. He gets me gifts and things he thinks I might need all the time. I just have to mention in passing that I need to go buy something and suddenly it's already been purchased and on the way. He'll text me when he's at the mall and demand that I send him pics of things I want. He'll go to the grocery store and bring me piles of food then cooks me dinner AND cleans!\n\nI'm not ppm or monthly, but he'll give me money whenever I say I need it.\n\nI don't know what to do with this man!\n\n&#x200B;",

Having said that...\n\nAnyone who has worked in a corporate setting long enough has had to live with such people.  People with authority over you who are not as capable as you.  People who behave in ways that would not be countenanced in other settings.  People who you come to despise for their often intentionally intimidating behaviour directed at you.  People in a position of power over you who f\\*ck with your career and you have no recourse but to accept it, unless that behaviour becomes so untenable that you choose to leave that job.\n\nI had one of those jobs.  To make a long story short, it was a hellacious work situation for which I made about $10K per day in stock vesting.  So I ask: how long would you continue to work in a terrible job for that kind of reward?\n\nWhat I am hoping to put on display is that you are certain to have to interact with miserable people in your lifetime, people who have something you want.  With time and experience you learn to weigh the pros and cons of that job and then to do the calculus.  Of course this person should get their comeuppance, but you can't just call the police and solve that non-criminal problem.  Only you can decide how much compensation the pain is worth.",

That's why he's pissed off, he feels like he got used as an ATM. This is due to your inability to phrase it correctly that you were not going to be getting together with him. \n\nYou should have said you want to see him for a platonic date night. You recognize that part of it but you don't accept any responsibility for what happened after and want to conclude it with theft.\n\nHe acted inappropriately and not like a gentleman. But you set it up knowing that you're already playing with fire with this guy and that you think crime is OK says a lot about you and what you should be working on for yourself. You guys are a good match.\n\nThe ATM thing you have to realize girls are constantly doing that to us. My last M+G, in advance I tried to work out the allowance details to know if we're on the same page. She said she wanted to talk about that in person (this is in my experience never comfortable to start from zero with this conversation). Halfway through the dinner she just flat out asked me to give her EDIT: a bunch of money right there. This wasn't in context of allowance this was just give me this now.\n\nShe left after to hang out with friends. \n\nSo all she was looking for was a meal and a pickup at an ATM and then to go spend the money with friends. The reason she didn't want to talk about that in advance is that I'd probably have said no to the date entirely having recognized her as a rinser. Instead she at least gets the meal for sure and she gets to play the lotto to see how stupid I am on the spot. \n\nI gave her a bit for showing up to show I'm sincere and as a transportation fee. Then got a taxi for her after which she walked because her friends were literally waiting for her a few hundred yards away. So more like champagne money than a long taxi ride home. \n\nSo that's why men get pissed off if they think plans are changing midstream. Because they know that plans are not changing midstream but this is how it was intended to go and they're just not getting an honest shake, rather they are getting an honest shakedown a lot of the time. It can be very, very triggering. This is not to excuse his behavior, he handled it like a child and he owes you an apology. The context though helps to explain how he gets there.\n\nIf you leave your guard down this can happen to you a few times a week from people on the site.\n\nIf you try to defend your wallet you start getting lines about \"oh so sex is the ONLY thing you're interested in\" to which you have to respond \"money seems to be the only thing you're interested in... and free food.\" From there you get a complete dissolution of any vibe or relationship, but that is indeed the conversation that can happen from there.",

That is disregarding your time and your plans that you may have had before he contacted you. Also, him acting like a child at the table should have been the last straw. If I were you, I would have said nothing, removed myself from the table, and went home. I am not a fan of grown men acting out. It is embarrassing, and it is not cute. On top of that, he was gaslighting you, and he attempted to keep you out late after you said, \"I don't want to be up late.\" He has disregarded you twice....Again, I am not coming at you. I am just simply saying that when you encounter men like him, you respond accordingly.",

Which is that he was upset that he got on a platonic date this time. If you want to throw that line out the one you want to use it on him, I'm trying to help you understand how he may have felt. You're dismissing how he may have felt because you want to take no responsibility at all for the results (even though you admit to some).",

Unfortunately I didn't realize this till after we got to the restaurant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for the cc, it's not mine, but he gives it to me to use pretty regularly. Like I said, he can be very sweet. He gets me gifts and things he thinks I might need all the time. He'll text me when he's at the mall and demand that I send him pics of things I want. He'll go to the grocery store and bring me piles of food then cook me dinner AND clean! \n\nI'm not ppm or monthly, but he'll give me money whenever I say I need it.\n\nI don't know what to do with this man!",
