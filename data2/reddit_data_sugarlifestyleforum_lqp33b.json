    "body": "There's been a lot of heated discussion in this forum the last couple days. Overall this feels healthy bcs it helps us surface some of the core issues within the sugar construct. Specifically it has me thinking about the difference between getting rinsed and getting rejected.\n\nLet's try to define terms:\n\n1. Rinser: Specific intent to mislead in order to secure $$$ w/o intimacy\n2. Rejection: (pot)SB starts the date with an open mind, but at some point decides she is not interested in intimacy. and (pot)SB actualizes her preference (no sex) by avoiding intimacy  \n\nI definitely understand how an SD would be upset about getting rinsed - you're getting lied to! And that sucks!\n\nAnd I also understand how an SD would be upset about getting rejected. bcs... it hurts emotionally to have someone say they're not interested in you sexually. Maybe doubly so in this context where there's often a latent sense that $$$ = intimacy. \n\nSo it's fine to be upset in both cases. But there's also a big difference imo:\n\n\\- When you get rinsed, it's perfectly fine to be upset \\_with the SB\\_!\n\n\\- When you get rejected, it's fine to be upset, but not at the SB. The SB just exercised her freedom of choice. and chose not to be intimate with you.\n\nBoth situations offer an opportunity for self-reflection. What might I have done that opened the door to getting taking advantage of by a rinser? And with rejection we might ask, What choices did I make / what behaviors of mine may have encouraged her to say No?\n\nAnd we use those moments as an opportunity to learn about ourselves. about women. about sugar. about life.\n\nIn terms of the money: If you don't have the financial means to take a few Losses here and there, then you're probably not in the right place. \n\nIn terms of consent: SD's, let's get to the heart of this - do you really want to be intimate with an SB who is going against her own desire/intuition? who is forcing herself to be intimate with you? Whether it's bcs of social pressure, financial pressure, people-pleasing, ... whatever. \n\n\\_SDs\\_ should be promoting full + free consent. And setting up the whole relationship to support that. The financial incentives should support that. Communication should support that. Everything about our interactions with (pot)SB should support that.\n\nGranted, we won't do it perfectly. But that can should be our goal (imo). \n\nOtherwise, and be honest, you just want an escort/sex-slave.\n\n\\----\n\nThis is already long, but let's remind ourselves why we're here. What sugar is about. and how it's different than escort-life (bcs this isn't ELF...) \n\nI think there's a core agreement within SLF that sugar **\u2260** escort. That's a bright line. \n\nAnd what exactly separates the two? \n\n\\- Escort: Exchange of money for sexual activity\n\n\\- Sugar: Exchange of value ($, gifts, TBD) for time/attention. And, as defined by the participants, an \\_opportunity\\_ for sexual activity\n\nWith an escort, sex is essentially guaranteed\n\nWith sugar, there's an \\*opportunity\\* for sex. but the position on the consent spectrum (for the SB) is very different than an escort. \n\nThis can be beneficial for both parties: \n\nSBs are more closely aligned with their broader, true preferences\n\nSDs get a different experience bcs it's a more honest consensual relationship. and that opens the door to a much richer world of interactions. If you're sugaring, presumably that's what you want! A richer relationship than we can get via escort-life. but not vanilla either.\n\nIs sugar perfect? Probably not for everyone. Probably not for people who never want to encounter rejection. \n\nSo if you're one of those SDs who always wants to hear yes, then be honest with yourself: Sugar may not be the right thing for me! and stop blaming the SBs...",

I always make it clear a casual coffee date with a time constraint is fine for both our comfort in case we don't click, some guys really want to go have a fancy dinner instead. In this case, SDs just have to accept if the arrangement doesn't go ahead not to get mad because \"I paid for this dinner\" that I didn't even ask for lol.",

On the intimate date she came over and we kissed, touched etc. but she just couldn\u2019t get into it. After a few drinks she said she had to go and we never had sex. She didn\u2019t want a PPM since we didn\u2019t have sex. \n\nI thought the whole thing was weird because she had been very sex forward with me beforehand: sending me nude pics unprompted, sexting, naughty talk etc. \nShe did mention during the M&G that she had issues around intimacy because of something that happened in her past. So I just figured it was due to those issues that she didn\u2019t feel comfortable having sex with me. \n\nWe kept in touch occasionally and she actually just reached out to me yesterday and said she was sorry, she thought she could put herself out there for money but she just couldn\u2019t do it. I told her not to worry about it I understand, it can be tough especially when you\u2019re brand new to this. She then suggested we have drinks this week and catch up. She doesn\u2019t want to do the sugar thing anymore lol. \n\nLong story short, I was fine with her rejecting sex. I never put any pressure on her. And we remained friends and now we will meet for drinks lol.",

It takes time to text with a POT SD, it takes time to do a M&G, it takes time to get ready - to shave, do hair+makeup, drive, etc..., it takes mental energy for her to show up and be engaging and pay attention to YOU. \n\nBut you only want to hand over money if there's sex... \n\nYou do you. But amongst financially successful people who value their time, I don't understand why so many SDs are so vehemently resistant to paying for non-intimate dates. \n\nC'mon... A lot of us charge by the hour. or 15min increments even. And we charge \\*a lot\\*. And then we're refusing to compensate SBs bcs ... we didn't get absolutely everything we had hoped for.\n\nCry me a river. \n\nMy preference: Be a gentlemen. Be generous.",

And that sucks!  \n>  \n>And  I also understand how an SD would be upset about getting rejected.  bcs... it hurts emotionally to have someone say they're not interested  in you sexually\n\nI think there's a  mismatch here between your theory and the actual bowl.  In actuality, you have no way of knowing whether you are getting rinsed or rejected -- if the 2nd case actually happens at all, it looks just like the first case.  This is similar to an SB getting rejected after the first intimate date -- not easy for her to tell if it was a pump & dump, or some genuine incompatibility, because in both cases, the SD might do similar things (e.g., ghost, and/or tell her they're not compatible), and the ultimate outcome is identical.\n\nIn any case, with sooo many rinsers, and with tiktokers actively promoting and coaching it, this is the more likely scenario.\n\n>In terms of the money: If you don't have the financial means to take a  few Losses here and there, then you're probably not in the right place.\n\nI agree, but not everyone is content acting like --  and getting treated like -- a buffoon who deserves to be treated like a sucker, and is willing to have that happen to them over and over just because they can afford it.  And someone who willfully lets himself or herself get taken advantage of over and over, attracts even more scammers to the bowl, and makes the bowl worse for everyone.  So to the extent your argument seems to be: just throw money around and hope it works out, and if you get taken advantage of, just ignore it ... your presence in the bowl makes the bowl worse for everyone.\n\nI realize that not every SB who would like up-front platonic dates w/ PPM is a rinser; some are fine SBs for whom this is what feels right to them.  My own approach is that I'd be open to up-front platonic dates, I'd never agree to PPM in advance (which filters out the rinsers, which is what this is all about), but I'd absolutely give them a gift anyway (which is what *my* notion of being an SD is about, taking care of an *actual* SB).\n\nThat, of course, is theoretical -- it's pretty rare SBs ask for up-front platonic dates, and they always recuse themselves if I agree but sans PPM.",

But your 98% number is made up from whole cloth.  There's not a whole lot of effective screening against a convincing rinser to be done in advance, it's not a difficult skill to be convincing,and all you have to do is be awake to see it's not uncommon and more guys than not have been stung; hell, that's WHY they stopped agreeing to M&G fees in advance.\n\nWhile screening and filtering is important, IME there's exactly one way to get to that 98% number: don't agree to that up-front M&G fee or initial-platonic-dates fee.  Absolute best tool we have.  But that doesn't mean you shouldn't live up to being whatever your vision of a good SD is ... once the rinsers have weeded themselves out because you won't agree to their M&G fee, give the SB who shows up a gift anyway.   \"Don't make goofy choices that are known to have a high probability of leading to getting scammed\" and \"be a good SD\" can be easily made to work together.  The idea that these things are incompatible -- you're a generous SD \\*\\*or\\*\\* you don't agree to M&G fees up front -- is false.",

There's a difference between accepting that it's a risk and accepting that it's a norm.  \n\nWe should take reasonable precautions (on both sides of the bowl), but we also need to be going into each M&G with open eyes and the understanding that, as the man says,  \"It is possible to\u00a0commit no mistakes and still lose\". Chances are if you're in this long enough,  you'll eventually miss the signs, or run up against someone who doesn't give off any signs; and get rinsed/ pump and dumped. \n\nAs far as finances, I think what OP is saying is,  if your finances are such that one \"undeserved\" PPM makes a notable impact, they're going to be equally impacted each week by a successful SR. \n\nThis is the confusing thing to me about the whole discussion.  The loss to a bad or bad-faith date isn't the money. My sugar money is budgeted for the (week/ month/year depending on how you want to look at it) and was spent either way. It's the loss of time- that's one more week before I find my next actual SB. One more week of chatting and vetting and setting up M&Gs and all that  grunt work.  And there's an emotional cost too, whether it's a rejection or a premeditated rinsing, I'm going to _feel_ rejected to some degree. I thought  she was interested in me, but it turns out she wasn't.",

It is incredibly simple, and works amazingly well.  No need to try to use grade-school level shaming (oh ho!  You can't afford it, then!).  There is absolutely no reason to bring up whether one can \"afford\" to lose a PPM otherwise;  anyone who has read slf for even a day knows full well that isn't why SDs won't promise payment up-front for M&Gs, so this point is disingenuous... and that same reader also knows SDs here promote the idea of giving her a gift anyway (provided she looks like her pics yadda yadda)",

In the end, we have similar views on how an SD treats an SB -- which isn't necessarily anything any other SD has to buy into, but we're not far apart.   But I think it's a pretty critical tool -- more for the M&G, but also for platonic up-front dates -- to have her show up without a guaranteed payoff.  It's not one I'm willing to give up.\n\n>Second, it really depends on what you mean by \"a lot of unnecessary  risk\" - if I've reviewed an SBs profile, texted with them a while,  spoken on the phone with them and had a M&G with them.

The girls who do this go for as many PPM dates as possible, and based on many SD stories it seems like they're extremely adept at making it feel like \"Just a couple more, I'm getting super comfortable\".  They ghost when the SD finally puts his foot down.  I think you might be underestimating them -- most of the stories I've read, the girls went to the M&Gs, texted in between, etc., their whole deal is to get him excited and invested, then sunken-cost him until he wises up.\n\nI just don't see a need for any of this aggravation, when I think I can put nearly all of this to bed by just doing it my way... and still go home at night happy that I treated her well.\n\n>Last thing, I think your strategy re M&G is fine. Maybe even  optimal. But let's also get clear on this: Your position that giving a  surprise gift on good faith M&G's is not the norm.\n\nYou think so?

Things go wrong when SDs P&D without giving or when an SB accepts sugar without giving. End of story. With my SB, we had a zero cost zero intimacy walk in a park M&G for 1.5 hours. Our next meet was PPM and I communicated that I was happy to keep my boxers on the whole time and that intimacy would involve sexual pleasure for her only, when she initiated. And she did, and that's what exactly what happened. Our subsequent dates involved intercourse which happened very naturally because we built a degree of trust. She wanted to see me the next day and she did.\n\nSDs need to just put on their big boy pants and get over feelings of rejection from someone who is a stranger. Just next, and try with someone else. Don't do more than one PPM date with no intimacy, just say: \"This is not working, I want someone who appreciates my support in the form of intimacy. I'm not willing to continue PPM until you maybe feel comfortable with me. I will move on and try again with someone else.\" And move on, get over it. I think what happens is that a lot of SDs go crazy because maybe for the first time in their life a 10/10 is talking with them or seen in public with them. It feels good, blows their mind, and they don't know how to act. In the bowl, there is always another 10 out there.\n\nI don't agree with it but I can't blame the SBs who continue to accept support for no intimacy in return. Almost anyone would do it if they could. When that happens, it's the SDs fault.",

A lot of the GFE escorts pick and choose their clients and sometimes they don't have sex at all. The lines become a little blurry when you add in dinners, dates, gifts and long term clients. However, the core of the escort is business. It's a business.\n\nOnce a SB start having 3-6 SD at the same time and juggling them as like a business then I think she is no different than an escort. There would be so little investment in the relationship that it's almost a business.\n\nFor rinsers vs rejections I think it boils down to #1 prior consent and #2 whether he gave her the $$ with the expectation of getting it.\n\nThere are guys who actually ignore \"platonic only\" in a SB profile and push for sex. They would even agree to a payment hoping for sex after the M&G. The line is fuzzy at that point because some SB have been known to fall for it and agree. So I don't think any sane guy would blame the SB if she rejected him. The guy might get angry afterwards but it's just like asking a girl out for dinner and she chooses not to date him afterwards.",

In that case, sure just say so. But if no intimacy has happened, we have no way of truly knowing if you are rinsing us or not, hence why we do not want to pay for platonic. If you already had intimate relationships, then sure, no problems in that case we can just reschedule. Unless it becomes a pattern, in which case as you mention nobody wants to be in a relationship where intimacy is forced, so it's better to break things off. Also, this is why in that vetting period I only do PPM for non platonic dates. It weeds out the ones that tries to minimize sexual encounters. Now let's say all that has been validated, then it means you are on an allowance. If you don't feel like it no issue, we can have a platonic date instead.\nAlso, I completely reject your definition of a SR. I do not pay for time and or attention per say. I pay for an healthy sex positive adult relationship. I can have a relationship where I get attention and time without sex with a wife. Or for a fraction of the cost of a real SR.",

Ideally a simple M&G at no cost where time  spent is the cost of due diligence and the cost of business, just like marketing. Next a PPM trial to see if thing continue to work at the next level. Sometimes the marketing is so good that I buy what I don\u2019t want or need. Fortunately, in this instance there are no long term contracts that I get trapped into other than by my own psychology. Finally an ongoing arrangement with either party free to terminate at any time. No one should be obligated to do anything and just like with cars sometimes one gets a lemon and that is just life and time to trade it in. This goes for both sides in any arrangement.",

Ug, no. If I could magically go straight from SA to an arrangement I would, but in reality its a necessity. \n\nSimply, my intentions are to look for an ongoing arrangement but there is no certification that allows POTs to see my intentions versus PnD, or free dates (if this latter option really exists).",

But your 98% number is made up from whole cloth.  There's not a whole lot of effective screening against a convincing rinser to be done in advance, it's not a difficult skill to be convincing,and all you have to do is be awake to see it's not uncommon and more guys than not have been stung; hell, that's WHY they stopped agreeing to M&G fees in advance.\n\nWhile screening and filtering is important, IME there's exactly one way to get to that 98% number: don't agree to that up-front M&G fee or initial-platonic-dates fee.  Absolute best tool we have.  But that doesn't mean you shouldn't live up to being whatever your vision of a good SD is ... once the rinsers have weeded themselves out because you won't agree to their M&G fee, give the SB who shows up a gift anyway.   \"Don't make goofy choices that are known to have a high probability of leading to getting scammed\" and \"be a good SD\" can be easily made to work together.  The idea that these things are incompatible -- you're a generous SD \\*\\*or\\*\\* you don't agree to M&G fees up front -- is false.",

There's a difference between accepting that it's a risk and accepting that it's a norm.  \n\nWe should take reasonable precautions (on both sides of the bowl), but we also need to be going into each M&G with open eyes and the understanding that, as the man says,  \"It is possible to\u00a0commit no mistakes and still lose\". Chances are if you're in this long enough,  you'll eventually miss the signs, or run up against someone who doesn't give off any signs; and get rinsed/ pump and dumped. \n\nAs far as finances, I think what OP is saying is,  if your finances are such that one \"undeserved\" PPM makes a notable impact, they're going to be equally impacted each week by a successful SR. \n\nThis is the confusing thing to me about the whole discussion.  The loss to a bad or bad-faith date isn't the money. My sugar money is budgeted for the (week/ month/year depending on how you want to look at it) and was spent either way. It's the loss of time- that's one more week before I find my next actual SB. One more week of chatting and vetting and setting up M&Gs and all that  grunt work.  And there's an emotional cost too, whether it's a rejection or a premeditated rinsing, I'm going to _feel_ rejected to some degree. I thought  she was interested in me, but it turns out she wasn't.",

It is incredibly simple, and works amazingly well.  No need to try to use grade-school level shaming (oh ho!  You can't afford it, then!).  There is absolutely no reason to bring up whether one can \"afford\" to lose a PPM otherwise;  anyone who has read slf for even a day knows full well that isn't why SDs won't promise payment up-front for M&Gs, so this point is disingenuous... and that same reader also knows SDs here promote the idea of giving her a gift anyway (provided she looks like her pics yadda yadda)",

They ghost when the SD finally puts his foot down.

However, of course they all want to have a few drinks before getting intimate. If we\u2019ve been drinking all night then I\u2019ll just want to go to bed, and no sex lol. It\u2019s the SB\u2019s that usually want to have sex haha. \n\nSame thing happened to me recently with one of my SB\u2019s. She came over and I made her dinner. Had lots of wine. She started to get frisky and wanted to have sex but I wasn\u2019t in the mood after a big dinner and lots of wine. She seemed a little offended and later told me she felt like I didn\u2019t want her anymore. I said no I was just super full and drunk lol!",

But your 98% number is made up from whole cloth.  There's not a whole lot of effective screening against a convincing rinser to be done in advance, it's not a difficult skill to be convincing,and all you have to do is be awake to see it's not uncommon and more guys than not have been stung; hell, that's WHY they stopped agreeing to M&G fees in advance.\n\nWhile screening and filtering is important, IME there's exactly one way to get to that 98% number: don't agree to that up-front M&G fee or initial-platonic-dates fee.  Absolute best tool we have.  But that doesn't mean you shouldn't live up to being whatever your vision of a good SD is ... once the rinsers have weeded themselves out because you won't agree to their M&G fee, give the SB who shows up a gift anyway.   \"Don't make goofy choices that are known to have a high probability of leading to getting scammed\" and \"be a good SD\" can be easily made to work together.  The idea that these things are incompatible -- you're a generous SD \\*\\*or\\*\\* you don't agree to M&G fees up front -- is false.",

It is incredibly simple, and works amazingly well.  No need to try to use grade-school level shaming (oh ho!  You can't afford it, then!).  There is absolutely no reason to bring up whether one can \"afford\" to lose a PPM otherwise;  anyone who has read slf for even a day knows full well that isn't why SDs won't promise payment up-front for M&Gs, so this point is disingenuous... and that same reader also knows SDs here promote the idea of giving her a gift anyway (provided she looks like her pics yadda yadda)",

In the end, we have similar views on how an SD treats an SB -- which isn't necessarily anything any other SD has to buy into, but we're not far apart.   But I think it's a pretty critical tool -- more for the M&G, but also for platonic up-front dates -- to have her show up without a guaranteed payoff.  It's not one I'm willing to give up.\n\n>Second, it really depends on what you mean by \"a lot of unnecessary  risk\" - if I've reviewed an SBs profile, texted with them a while,  spoken on the phone with them and had a M&G with them.

The girls who do this go for as many PPM dates as possible, and based on many SD stories it seems like they're extremely adept at making it feel like \"Just a couple more, I'm getting super comfortable\".  They ghost when the SD finally puts his foot down.  I think you might be underestimating them -- most of the stories I've read, the girls went to the M&Gs, texted in between, etc., their whole deal is to get him excited and invested, then sunken-cost him until he wises up.\n\nI just don't see a need for any of this aggravation, when I think I can put nearly all of this to bed by just doing it my way... and still go home at night happy that I treated her well.\n\n>Last thing, I think your strategy re M&G is fine. Maybe even  optimal. But let's also get clear on this: Your position that giving a  surprise gift on good faith M&G's is not the norm.\n\nYou think so?

In the end, we have similar views on how an SD treats an SB -- which isn't necessarily anything any other SD has to buy into, but we're not far apart.   But I think it's a pretty critical tool -- more for the M&G, but also for platonic up-front dates -- to have her show up without a guaranteed payoff.  It's not one I'm willing to give up.\n\n>Second, it really depends on what you mean by \"a lot of unnecessary  risk\" - if I've reviewed an SBs profile, texted with them a while,  spoken on the phone with them and had a M&G with them.

The girls who do this go for as many PPM dates as possible, and based on many SD stories it seems like they're extremely adept at making it feel like \"Just a couple more, I'm getting super comfortable\".  They ghost when the SD finally puts his foot down.  I think you might be underestimating them -- most of the stories I've read, the girls went to the M&Gs, texted in between, etc., their whole deal is to get him excited and invested, then sunken-cost him until he wises up.\n\nI just don't see a need for any of this aggravation, when I think I can put nearly all of this to bed by just doing it my way... and still go home at night happy that I treated her well.\n\n>Last thing, I think your strategy re M&G is fine. Maybe even  optimal. But let's also get clear on this: Your position that giving a  surprise gift on good faith M&G's is not the norm.\n\nYou think so?

In the end, we have similar views on how an SD treats an SB -- which isn't necessarily anything any other SD has to buy into, but we're not far apart.   But I think it's a pretty critical tool -- more for the M&G, but also for platonic up-front dates -- to have her show up without a guaranteed payoff.  It's not one I'm willing to give up.\n\n>Second, it really depends on what you mean by \"a lot of unnecessary  risk\" - if I've reviewed an SBs profile, texted with them a while,  spoken on the phone with them and had a M&G with them. And they go  through all of that to rinse me for a platonic PPM, that doesn't seem  like a lot of risk to me. That feels pretty low risk.\n\nI don't think it's ever one PPM, do you?  The girls who do this go for as many PPM dates as possible, and based on many SD stories it seems like they're extremely adept at making it feel like \"Just a couple more, I'm getting super comfortable\".  They ghost when the SD finally puts his foot down.  I think you might be underestimating them -- most of the stories I've read, the girls went to the M&Gs, texted in between, etc., their whole deal is to get him excited and invested, then sunken-cost him until he wises up.\n\nI just don't see a need for any of this aggravation, when I think I can put nearly all of this to bed by just doing it my way... and still go home at night happy that I treated her well.\n\n>Last thing, I think your strategy re M&G is fine. Maybe even  optimal. But let's also get clear on this: Your position that giving a  surprise gift on good faith M&G's is not the norm.\n\nYou think so?  I think it's the norm **on slf.**   Nearly every SD does this, or claims they do, no?\n\nAlso, agree \"buffoon\" is a fantastic word.",

In the real world. Or on SLF. \n\nI have a feeling. \n\nAnd it's influenced by the highly charged posts from the last couple days.

I'm sampling from (1) my experience and (2) the specific posts/comments that I've chanced to read on SLF and (3) conversations with a few friends that have some experience here.\n\nThat's a fairly small and skewed sample. \n\nWhich is to say: I don't \\_really\\_ know what the norm is. In the real world. Or on SLF. \n\nI have a feeling. \n\nAnd it's influenced by the highly charged posts from the last couple days. Where it felt like a number of SDs were losing their minds over the issue of paying and not getting sex.\n\nTheir comments + behavior felt (feel) wrong to me.\n\n\\---\n\nI probably am underestimating the scammers. In large part bcs I haven't had a traumatic experience like the one you describe, being played for multiple dates. \n\nI shake my head and say, \"That wouldn't happen to me.\"\n\nWhich another part of me know is exactly the kind of attitude that opens to the door to getting taken.\n\nBut without knowing how often this stuff happens. and some of the underlying fact pattern / details. it's really hard to know what level of risk there is for an SD that takes reasonable precautions. \n\nMy sense is that a good number of the guys who got scammed let their dick do too much of the thinking. and ignored a lot of red flags. \n\nbut I also admit that there are high quality scam artists out there. In every domain. And it's not just about $$$. They enjoy the art of the steal. If your adversary is an experienced pro, almost everyone is probably going to get taken down...\n\nok, I think I've run out of useful things to say (probably happened a few hundred (thousand?) words ago)\n\nI take my leave.",
