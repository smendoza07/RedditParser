I know she's often depicted as the Tsundere type because of her stern/brash personality, but her talks with Shikamaru really showed her softer side. \n\nI don't usually get into shipping discussions because a lot of times it's based on fantasies that fans have projected onto characters, or very generic feelings that don't actually mean much, such as simply finding another character attractive. This somehow supersedes organic relationship growth/development, but that wasn't the case here and I gotta give Kishi his props for planting the seeds for this one as early as Part 1. They spent time together and had actual conversations to get to know each other better, like IDK, a real couple? Lol",

In Naruto she was a bit bratty yes, but she matured greatly in Shippuden. She was a calm character who playfully teased Shikamaru, and trash talked ennemies on the battlefield. \n\n...they stripped her of every original character traits to reduce her to a caricature that has been done hundreds of times already...",

Sure, she was kind of a blunt jerk sometimes, like you said, but especially in Shippuden, you can see how she's grown up, and in both parts, but especially Shippuden, she had a soft side that was really nice to see, and I loved how smart and strong she was as a ninja (her and Shikamaru's Chunin Exams fight is one ofmy faves for all the strategy). But now, she's not the same character, and I can't, in good conscience, like her OR her and Shikamaru's relationship when they're like that, not the ones WE know. :/\n\nSo to save myself the heartache, I just pretend everything about THAT characterization doesn't exist. lol.\n\nFor me, it's also kind of the same thing they did with Hinata in Boruto. She worked SO HARD all her life to get stronger and be respected for that strength, and then...she's a housewife in Boruto. :/ SUCKS, man. (At this point, because of the crap way Boruto handled all the OGs, I pretty much pretend it doesn't exist, lol. - And let's not even touch poor Tenten. X'P)",
