Bc with way things in the series went its proven that most uchiha reacted like that when they were made to suffer by the shinobi world or their governments. \n\nThere was harmony between the uchiha and the leaf govt during the time obito was a genin but things started to get strained after danzo tried to blame konoha's uchiha for the nine tails attack and started to discriminate against them. Sasuke had no harsh feelings for the village till he found out that konoha's govt was responsible for the uchiha masscre. Madara was fine with his alliance with hashirama till  the uchiha started to get sidelined from government involvement \n\nMost problems with the uchiha wouldn't have occured if the government instead of trying to control or monitor the uchiha, tried to talk things out with them",

Sasuke had no harsh feelings for the village till he found out that konoha's govt was responsible for the uchiha masscre. Madara was fine with his alliance with hashirama till  the uchiha started to get sidelined from government involvement \n\nMost problems with the uchiha wouldn't have occured if the government instead of trying to control or monitor the uchiha, tried to talk things out with them",

Every single Uchiha fighter had a top post in this village.\n\nMeanwhile most Yamanaka sold flowers, Akimichi sold food products, Nara had deers, Hyuga were isolated and powerless.\n\nYes, I can see how those poor smol Uchiha were such oppressed victims when they had it better than everyone else.",
