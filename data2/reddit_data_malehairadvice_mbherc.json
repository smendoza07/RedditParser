Of course you should do what you're comfortable with, but I think that many people won't take you seriously if you walk around with a mustache. I myself am a settled man with kids and a wife, but I still wanna look my best at all times as I find that it increases my opportunities and make me look like I give a damn. This is only my opinion though and I am not trying to crap on your choice - I just hope that young guys won't go this route if they wanna improve their looks. Sorry if I came off somewhat rude.",

I myself am a settled man with kids and a wife, but I still wanna look my best at all times as I find that it increases my opportunities and make me look like I give a damn. This is only my opinion though and I am not trying to crap on your choice - I just hope that young guys won't go this route if they wanna improve their looks. Sorry if I came off somewhat rude.",

I myself am a settled man with kids and a wife, but I still wanna look my best at all times as I find that it increases my opportunities and make me look like I give a damn. This is only my opinion though and I am not trying to crap on your choice - I just hope that young guys won't go this route if they wanna improve their looks. Sorry if I came off somewhat rude.",
