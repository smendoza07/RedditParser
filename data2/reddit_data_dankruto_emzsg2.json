Guy can\u2019t help her summoning at all and he has no weapon expertise besides the weapons he carries.      \nNeji should have stayed with in-clan training full time because no one in the Leaf can help his eye become stronger. Guy could help him with Taijutsu, but how do you go easy on Neji without getting your chakra points shut down? It\u2019s obvious that Guy didn\u2019t didn\u2019t teach him much since Neji\u2019s fights included only his clan\u2019s tactics. Just giving Neji light gate training would have made him so much stronger.     \nGuy became attached to Lee and it resulted in the other two kids becoming shorted. Guy should have done more with Ten Ten considering she is almost as vanilla as Rock, but he never even allowed her to be sent off to an expert.      \nI don\u2019t know why this comment got so long.",

Guy can\u2019t help her summoning at all and he has no weapon expertise besides the weapons he carries.      \nNeji should have stayed with in-clan training full time because no one in the Leaf can help his eye become stronger. Guy could help him with Taijutsu, but how do you go easy on Neji without getting your chakra points shut down? It\u2019s obvious that Guy didn\u2019t didn\u2019t teach him much since Neji\u2019s fights included only his clan\u2019s tactics. Just giving Neji light gate training would have made him so much stronger.     \nGuy became attached to Lee and it resulted in the other two kids becoming shorted. Guy should have done more with Ten Ten considering she is almost as vanilla as Rock, but he never even allowed her to be sent off to an expert.      \nI don\u2019t know why this comment got so long.",
