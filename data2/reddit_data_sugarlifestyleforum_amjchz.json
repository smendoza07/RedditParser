    "body": "**Here is my 10 Step Program to find a SD...**\n\nStep 1: Download Google Voice & get a burner number to use online\n\nStep 2: Create a SB profile on [SEEKING.COM](https://seeking.com/)\n\nStep 3: Upload good quality face and full body photos w/ form fitting clothes\n\nStep 4: Write a great profile that showcases what makes you a good SB\n\nStep 5: Wait for SD to message you, or take initiative & send a well written message\n\nStep 6: Engage in meaningful conversations using more then 1 or 2 word sentences\n\nStep 7: Share your Google Voice number with POT SD when he asks for it\n\nStep 8: Set up a meet & greet dates to get coffee or drinks\n\nStep 9: Dress appropriate for the venue you're meeting at\n\nStep 10: Do not cancel or ghost & show up to the M&G on time\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**YOUR PHOTOS:** Heres a few things not to do with your profile photos\n\n* No Photos with Snapchat Filters..!!!\n* No group photos\n* No photos with males friends or BF\n* No blurry photos or out of focus photos\n* No far away photos\n* No photos sticking your tongue out in a childish way\n* No trick photography hiding your weight or figure\n* Do not use old photos when you were younger or thinner\n* Do not use photos you use on your other social media accounts \n\nPhotos should show what your face and body look like clearly. Do not give an illusion that you are more attractive or in better shape then you really are. Its much better to look better in person then your photos, then to look better in photos and have the SD be disappointed that you catfished him.\n\nYou should have photos that show both casual dress, as well as dressed up to go out. Your photos should have form fitting clothes in your particular style of dress, that showcase your figure. There is no need to be overly provocative, but a little skin doesn't hurt. Swimsuit photos are ok to use as well, but no nudity or anything that comes off trashy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**YOUR PROFILE:** Write a good SB profile that will impress an SD, and make you standout from the crowd\n\n**The ABOUT ME SECTION:** Should be nothing like your tinder, bumble or match profile. It doesnt need to showcase all of your accomplishments, goals and everything you like. The about me section should really showcase the best qualities, attributes, and skill sets that make you an outstanding sugar baby, that will make a sugar daddy want to spend money on you. Plain and simple.\n\n**The SEEKING SECTION:** Should clearly tell the type of sugar relationship your looking for, what types of dates you want to go on with your SD, whether they will be only indoor, or also outdoor, and should mention that intimacy will be part of it as well. You should also paint a picture of what it will be like to date you, and how will you make a SD feel to be in your presence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**COMMUNICATION:**\n\nWhen communicating or initiating conversations, do not just say hi or hello. SB that are successful know how to communicate in multiword sentences.  When communicating, also show interest and respond with questions of your own. A good conversation is more then just a SD asking you questions, and you responding. Show some interest, and ask him questions as well.\n\n* Do not discuss money on [Seeking.com](https://Seeking.com), wait to do this by text or in person.\n* Before moving to text, establish the SD is looking for the same type of Sugar Relationship.\n* Once you move to text, try to set up a meet and greet within a few days\n* Do not text for weeks on end without meeting. You will never meet them.\n* Do not send nude photos until you are in a Sugar Relationship\n\n**Here are some tips to establish a good dialogue & meaningful conversation:**\n\n* Reference something from his \"ABOUT ME\" section that you thought was interesting\n* Restate something from your profile that matches his \"SEEKING\" section\n* Try to lead with a simple question (but not a Yes or No Question) \n* Limit your questions to one or two per message\n* Don't use wide open questions like \"what are you looking for?\"\n* Read & respond to his messages carefully, he may have asked you more then 1 thing\n* Mention any time constraints you might have in responding to him in a timely manner\n* If you don't have time to answer his message, respond & promise you'll message him later\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**MEET & GREET: THINGS NOT TO DO**\n\n* Do not ask to be paid to meet. SD might cover your gas or uber, but most wont pay to meet you. Your time is no more valuable then his, and you both have something to gain or lose by meeting each other.\n* Do not meet a SD/Man at his hotel or home on the 1st date, this will usually end up bad for you.\n* Do not ghost if you cant make it. Send a quick text the morning of, or the night before letting him know.\n* Don't turn the meet & greet into an awkward interview or negotiation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**MEET & GREET: THINGS TO DO**\n\n* Be on time. SD dont have time to wait extra 45 minutes because you didnt plan properly\n* Communicate if you are running late, and give updates along the way\n* Dress appropriately for the venue you are meeting at (casual or dressy, etc)\n* Be classy, be fun and always be yourself\n* This is your chance to showcase your personality, & make him want to date you\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*New thread was started per the suggestion of [u/SubstantialPeak88](https://www.reddit.com/user/SubstantialPeak88)  and [u/Rosa\\_Velvet](https://www.reddit.com/user/Rosa_Velvet) \n\n\\*Added new Communication tips per suggestion of u[/TooOldForSD](https://www.reddit.com/user/TooOldForSD) ",

I also don\u2019t post or send nudes. If the potential SD doesn\u2019t like that, he should keep looking...there are lots of escorts and emotionally immature women from whom to gather nude photos. \n\nThe best reminder in this area is that if you act cheap\u2014 you will be treated as such. That goes both ways. \n\nMy experience is with 3 long term SDs from SA. ",

The good links are not above the top of the fold - [mobile screen shot](https://imgur.com/a/PFx7wnk) \n2. It does not have call to action statements - \u201cclick here\u201d for instance. \n3. The layout is good, but quick bullets attract the eyes.\n\nGetting the links above top of the fold with action statements is super important.
