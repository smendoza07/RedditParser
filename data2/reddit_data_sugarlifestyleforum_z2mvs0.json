    "body": "Don\u2019t they realize that\u2019s why I\u2019m on here? I understand that without money involved I can\u2019t ever pull a woman like the ones I can on SA. If I could get the woman I desired for free, I wouldn\u2019t be on SA. Perhaps if you want brad Pitt you should be the one paying. \n\nOn the flip side, women should probably stop getting so upset when we have higher standards. We, after all, are the ones paying, so of course I\u2019m going to have higher standards as to what I want than if I was at a bar.\n\nIn genera the financial aspect is there to make up for the traditional attractiveness aspect. It\u2019s why the bowl exists and it just baffles me when I see women say things like \u201cI\u2019d only sugar with guys I would vanilla\u201d then complain they can\u2019t find anyone .",

If all I wanted was sex with an attractive woman, I would use Escorts. Escorts are cheaper, easier to find and less time consuming.\n\nI still want Sugar Dating to feel like normal dating, except with boundaries and financial support.  I do want them to be attracted to me. Maybe not because I'm a 20-something hunk, but maybe because they are attracted to the older \"Silver Fox\" types or maybe because they are attracted to intelligence, maturity, confidence, manners, generosity, etc more commonly found in an older successful man.",

It\u2019s why the bowl exists...\n\nOr maybe your understanding of the bowl is a tad simplistic. Yes, money can be used to compensate for other things, and certainly attractiveness is one of them. But so are inability to commit (because e.g. SD is married), lack of time (because SD is very busy), inconvenience (because SB has to hide from his wife), different ideas about future (SBs spends years with someone she knows she hasn't a future with), ... It would be helpful if everybody understood that just because they financially support their SB \"to make up for the traditional attractiveness aspect\", that doesn't have to be the case for every SR. And in some cases, money isn't there to make up for anything. It's just genuine support.\n\nI would also advise SDs to try to understand that they have to be attractive *in some way* in the mind of their SB. It is fascinates me how some men here feel entitled to very attractive SBs (\"because, you know, my dick just doesn't work with regular women...\"), but assume that women are able to have sex with anybody as long as they get money out of it.\n\nAll that being said, I find calling people \"ugly\" and shaming of obese people appaling and it is certainly not better when SBs on this forum are the ones doing it.",

Most want to be attracted to you in some way. That need not be physically to start. It can totally be through the heart of who you are. Attraction builds from there.",

Sure, he\u2019s got movie-star good looks, but he\u2019s still old! Young women romanticize him, but that doesn\u2019t make it realistic. \n\nAnd guys like Leonard DiCaprio date hot young women because: fame + money. I promise you if he was average Joe, he wouldn\u2019t be able to do that. \n\nI\u2019ve had vanilla hookups with young women before (21, 21) and short vanilla things (23, 24), but those are RARE. And the vanilla ones I found on Seeking. The hookups were Tinder. But they just don\u2019t turn into relationships for all kinds of reasons. \n\nOlder guys don\u2019t often pull younger women because MOST younger women want to date within 5-10 years of their own age.\n\nAnyway, you being on Seeking has little to do with your looks, and has more to do with you being attracted to much younger, prettier women (which is very normal for a man, countless studies have shown this). With that being said, stop being so self-defeating and LOSE weight. It WILL help you with all types of dating.",

Some of us are here because ultimately we want a carefree relationship with someone young, beautiful and fun loving, without having to worry about where this relationship is going, and settling down, having kids or starting family. Personally most of the SB ive dated, are just as attractive or better, then many that I dated in my 20's and 30's, only difference is that it took more work to get them back then, and now its a bit easier, because money opens the doors to meeting them, but maturity, good manners, confidence and success help close the deal, as well as still taking care of yourself and looking good for your age.",

Hell some wives make SDs feel that way. I hear it a lot from colleagues. Wife's just going through the motion laying in bed while the hubs pumps away and she probably thinking \"hmm do I have onions or do I need to go get some? Oh wait I think I do have some but I may need more. Ok I'll just get some anyhow\" And it will become obvious she just isn't into you. These are wives that presumably married us in our prime and not for sugar.\n\nEscorts they don't care or learn to suppress that part of repulsion because they really are hot for Ben and his 9 plus clones at minimum if you want a hot babe and good experience and not someone who deals in volume. Benny gets them wet and going.  Now there are escorts that sugar as well so it's not a perfect example. Hell last time I went on SA I really thought these 2 girls were going to be awesome and I asked them questions and eventually it became obvious that they were escorts throwing terms from that field. I have nothing against that but not what I was looking for but now there are SO many on there. Usually they don't ask for a pic at anytime which is the red flag.  \n\nI'm not a young Brad PITT or future Brad PITT at 100 yr old.  So it's not like \"well that's easy for you to say\" my pics are unfiltered cuz I want them to see what i look like and may not be the best pic cuz if they like me then based on pics then they will maybe like me more when in person. \n\nI don't know if this is the case with you but don't bring a chip into the negotiations if they don't like what you offering.  What I mean is don't be an ass and mean about it if the conversation is going the way you like it? Also you may need to increase what your offering . \n\nPut yourself in a SBs shoes and be honest with yourself and say would I want to be with me if I offered only this D(Roman numeral )? What amount would make me less reluctant and be willing to give me a chance to at least meet and give me a chance to go beyond the physical? Perhaps M worth of US currency for a date.  \nMany of these SBs have offers blowing their mailboxes. \n\nYou may be obese but you also may be knowledgeable witty romantic generous gentleman and an unselfish lover who is well endowed or least above average. My ex told me about a guy she really wasn't into but she gave him a chance and he ate that like it was going behind a vault for 20 years ..so she would still see him cuz of that but she found him unattractive and annoying. Just saying got get their attention ..Then the other factor will weigh less against you.  \n\nGood luck though in your search. A good SR can be a very good experience indeed.",

Personally most of the SB ive dated, are just as attractive or better, then many that I dated in my 20's and 30's, only difference is that it took more work to get them back then, and now its a bit easier, because money opens the doors to meeting them, but maturity, good manners, confidence and success help close the deal, as well as still taking care of yourself and looking good for your age.",

There are a lot of women that are attracted to more than just youthful looks and there a lot of men who want more than just sex with an attractive woman.  I don't understand why that seems to offend people. \n\nI'm comfortable with my life choices, so I'm not bothered by other people's opinions about my life choices.  It's called maturity.",

Men do not have this positive side effect, quite the opposite in fact. \n\nJoking aside, I think it comes down to shared hobbies/activities, hygiene, and personality more than looks (at least from my experience). I do think a 20 yr old SB is gonna wanna go out and do stuff so the question becomes can we do the things I want to do together, and do we look terribly out of place with each other?",

I do think a 20 yr old SB is gonna wanna go out and do stuff so the question becomes can we do the things I want to do together, and do we look terribly out of place with each other?",
