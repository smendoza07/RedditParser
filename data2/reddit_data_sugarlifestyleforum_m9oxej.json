    "body": "Hi everyone! This is my first post ever on here. I\u2019ve been reading many of the stories that have been shared here and I want to share mine, as it\u2019s not something I get a chance to be open about so often in my personal life. \n\nI will be turning 22 this year. Straight after high school at the age of 18, I worked as a flight attendant for an international airline. During such time I was in a rather intense relationship with my ex-boyfriend who was much older than me. We broke up after 2 years just before I lost my job as a result of retrenchment. I had 3 months left to my work permit to decide whether I\u2019d move back to my home country, or find a different job here where I was based. \n\nI had set myself on finding a job here. I became active once again on SA after I made an account out of curiosity when I was 18, but never made use of. I met a couple guys from SA who I was seeing for a couple months each. The arrangement normally being a PPM after sharing some company. But there was no chemistry other than purely sexual. It felt empty, almost jarring at times. Then one day I came across my current SD.\n\nHe was straightforward with what he wanted. Meeting twice a week, at this gorgeous hotel in the city centre. A very substantial allowance given every week, no further discussion required between us after our initial online chat. He is this amazingly sweet, kind and soft spoken man. Who treated me with utmost respect ever since the very beginning. We could both tell how much we adored each other and felt something was way different, as we cuddled and laughed in bed. Endless kisses and bliss. He loved the same novels and films I did and we could discuss about absolutely rubbish for hours! I felt spoilt silly as I could even mumble about something I liked, and the next time we meet he\u2019d have exactly that as a gift for me. \n\nIt was about a month into our blossoming relationship. As I was lying in his arms, gently peppering his face with kisses. I was talking about my housemates (one of which was craaaazy!), to which he asked \u201cDo you enjoy staying there?\u201d. I replied \u201cIf I had a choice, I\u2019d honestly love to live alone.\u201d Then he said \u201cWell why didn\u2019t you mention it sooner? Let\u2019s look for a nice apartment for you!\u201d. Fast forward a few months until today, I have been living in a beautiful studio apartment in the city centre right in the business district. I wake up every day wondering if this is real.\n\nAfter settling into my new job and months of discussion, we have decided on myself pursuing a degree which is sponsored entirely. I am extremely excited to go on this new path in my life, totally different and so much more promising than what I had initially pictured. And it is all thanks to him. He coaches me and encourages me to be the best version of myself by getting an education and increasing my opportunities in life. I never expected him to make me feel so appreciated and loved, and above all believed in my inner potential. \n\nThanks for listening to my story. I wish you all a happy weekend wherever you are!",

                    "body": "Yeah, there are a lot of details here that don't sound right. \n\n\"Flight attendant for an international airline\". So if she is not in her home country (she needed to decide if she was going back home when her work permit expires in 3 months) that's not in the U.S. She needs a Green Card to work for a US based airline, and if she were just flying here with an international airline, she would not be on a work permit. She says \"find a different job where I was based\", so if it was a foreign base for a non-domestic airline she wouldn't have a non-job specific work permit in most countries I can think of, so it doesn't make much sense. \n\nIf not the US, I am still not sure where she'd get a work permit as a foreign 18 year old HS graduate that allows her to switch jobs at will after getting laid off by her airline. For instance, foreigners working for Emirates and residing in Dubai- pilots too, not just flight attendants, had to leave the UAE after they got laid off. \n\nSo she only has 3 months left in this magical work permit that isn't tied to her job at an international airline as a flight attendant, she spends several months with other SDs before Mr. Wonderful turns up, and in that time she's found a job that lets her stay in that country as a 21 year old who didn't go to uni (since we're now believing that the work permit exists) moved in with flatmates etc. All in a big city (which isn't cheap even if it's in Asia) since international airlines don't fly into small towns. \n\nDoesn't really pass the sniff test with me either. But maybe in the People's Republic of Fantasia all of these things are commonplace.",

I must say I was quite amused reading this knowing I am as real as can be haha.\n\nTo explain it a little further, (not that I feel I need to, but out of curiosity some might have) I was a stewardess specifically under a Singaporean based international airlines. The minimum joining age is 18 (as well as in most if not all Asian airlines apart from Emirates/Qatar Airways). Secondly, Singapore allows for several different types of work passes. For someone with a degree/higher education it would normally be an EP (employment pass) etc. For myself it\u2019s a WP (work permit) which is work pass generally given to those who apply without degrees/higher education like myself who are to work in the service/labour industry. And Singaporean laws are such that I could and was in fact encouraged by my former company to seek a different job and remain in Singapore. This is so the airline would more easily be able to rehire foreign crew once all the travel restrictions are gone and kick off again!\n\nI hope that can clear up some things. \ud83d\ude0a",

I have several friends who married SIA cabin crew.\n\nI have family and friends in high places in Singapore and have flown with SIA often for 4 decades and even partied with some SIA cabin crew back in my younger days. I know they hire from Malaysia, Indonesia, China, Taiwan, Thailand etc., and that you can be hired at 18 if you're tall (and attractive) enough. I know they had a major retrenchment last Fall, and that as part of the early departure program they were releasing laid off cabin crew from bond/loan obligations, but I was unaware that the government and SIA management were allowing you to stay in the Republic. \n\nIsn't a work pass for a max of 2 years though?\n\nGoing to school is a great idea for your future. And if your story is true, I apologize for doubting you and wish you all the best. There are a lot of people who tell tall tales- and not just on the internet! I once met a young lady who boasted about her whale boyfriend,  and how she flew on his Gulfstream all the time when my mate told her I had a Gulfstream. I said, \"Well then surely you can tell me what a FBO is?\", to which she replied, \"Of course I know! You think I'm making all this up?! FBO is Food and Beverage Operator!\" *Bzzzzzzzzzz* Sorry, wrong answer! Thank you for playing.",

All of which I would have never travelled to having not been in the company. And what you\u2019ve heard about the retrenchment is accurate too. It was in August! Although for the entirety of 6 months before that happened I did only 2 FLIGHTS as at some point we were barely operating at 2% which is mad considering the volume of flights prior to COVID. It was a lot of uncertainty but we felt it was coming soon anyway. However! Shit happens as they say. And I hope to have an entirely different path lined up. \n\nAnd yes the work permits do last for two years! As I was retrenched, the validity was cut short to 3 months after I received my notice.\n\nThanks for that last story though! I had a little giggle by myself at work. I figured at least know your shit if you\u2019re gonna tell a hell of a story like that. Haha. Have a great evening ahead! I hope you\u2019re having a relaxing one. Xo",

So if she is not in her home country (she needed to decide if she was going back home when her work permit expires in 3 months) that's not in the U.S. She needs a Green Card to work for a US based airline, and if she were just flying here with an international airline, she would not be on a work permit. She says \"find a different job where I was based\", so if it was a foreign base for a non-domestic airline she wouldn't have a non-job specific work permit in most countries I can think of, so it doesn't make much sense. \n\nIf not the US, I am still not sure where she'd get a work permit as a foreign 18 year old HS graduate that allows her to switch jobs at will after getting laid off by her airline. For instance, foreigners working for Emirates and residing in Dubai- pilots too, not just flight attendants, had to leave the UAE after they got laid off. \n\nSo she only has 3 months left in this magical work permit that isn't tied to her job at an international airline as a flight attendant, she spends several months with other SDs before Mr. Wonderful turns up, and in that time she's found a job that lets her stay in that country as a 21 year old who didn't go to uni (since we're now believing that the work permit exists) moved in with flatmates etc. All in a big city (which isn't cheap even if it's in Asia) since international airlines don't fly into small towns. \n\nDoesn't really pass the sniff test with me either.

I must say I was quite amused reading this knowing I am as real as can be haha.\n\nTo explain it a little further, (not that I feel I need to, but out of curiosity some might have) I was a stewardess specifically under a Singaporean based international airlines. The minimum joining age is 18 (as well as in most if not all Asian airlines apart from Emirates/Qatar Airways). Secondly, Singapore allows for several different types of work passes. For someone with a degree/higher education it would normally be an EP (employment pass) etc. For myself it\u2019s a WP (work permit) which is work pass generally given to those who apply without degrees/higher education like myself who are to work in the service/labour industry. And Singaporean laws are such that I could and was in fact encouraged by my former company to seek a different job and remain in Singapore. This is so the airline would more easily be able to rehire foreign crew once all the travel restrictions are gone and kick off again!\n\nI hope that can clear up some things. \ud83d\ude0a",

I have several friends who married SIA cabin crew.\n\nI have family and friends in high places in Singapore and have flown with SIA often for 4 decades and even partied with some SIA cabin crew back in my younger days. I know they hire from Malaysia, Indonesia, China, Taiwan, Thailand etc., and that you can be hired at 18 if you're tall (and attractive) enough. I know they had a major retrenchment last Fall, and that as part of the early departure program they were releasing laid off cabin crew from bond/loan obligations, but I was unaware that the government and SIA management were allowing you to stay in the Republic. \n\nIsn't a work pass for a max of 2 years though?\n\nGoing to school is a great idea for your future. And if your story is true, I apologize for doubting you and wish you all the best. There are a lot of people who tell tall tales- and not just on the internet! I once met a young lady who boasted about her whale boyfriend,  and how she flew on his Gulfstream all the time when my mate told her I had a Gulfstream. I said, \"Well then surely you can tell me what a FBO is?\", to which she replied, \"Of course I know! You think I'm making all this up?! FBO is Food and Beverage Operator!\" *Bzzzzzzzzzz* Sorry, wrong answer! Thank you for playing.",

All of which I would have never travelled to having not been in the company. And what you\u2019ve heard about the retrenchment is accurate too. It was in August! Although for the entirety of 6 months before that happened I did only 2 FLIGHTS as at some point we were barely operating at 2% which is mad considering the volume of flights prior to COVID. It was a lot of uncertainty but we felt it was coming soon anyway. However! Shit happens as they say. And I hope to have an entirely different path lined up. \n\nAnd yes the work permits do last for two years! As I was retrenched, the validity was cut short to 3 months after I received my notice.\n\nThanks for that last story though! I had a little giggle by myself at work. I figured at least know your shit if you\u2019re gonna tell a hell of a story like that. Haha. Have a great evening ahead! I hope you\u2019re having a relaxing one. Xo",
