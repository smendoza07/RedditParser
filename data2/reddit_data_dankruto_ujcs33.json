Strained relationships with their neglectful fathers, being weaker than their older brothers that keep distance from them (and in Hinata's case her older brother and younger sister) anxiety to live up to their clan's prestige. The biggest difference between them is the we know Sasuke had a loving mother, while we don't know if Hinata's mom was even alive or not. I think if the massacre never happened, Sasuke would be pretty similar to Hinata in terms of thoughts of self worth and tenacity towards improvement, I bet he, like Hinata, would've found inspiration in Naruto. \n\n(By the way I am totally not normal about Naruto marrying basically Sasuke pre-trauma. I mean Hinata even *looks* similar to Sasuke, with the dark bluish hair and pale skin and affinity for wearing lavender and also having an ocular kekkei genkai. Gdi Naruto why didn't you just marry Sasuke??)\n\nAnd then for Sasuke and Hinata as a potential relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to admit the *entire reason* I showed interest in this ship was because when I was reading the chunin exams arch as a freaking thirteen year old, I noticed that Hinata was literally the *only* girl Sasuke's age who didn't have a positive thought about him. I thought it would be the fucking funniest thing in the world if Sasuke was interested in the only girl that didn't give a shit about him. The hottest guy in the room actually having to work to impress a girl instead is a way more compelling narrative to me than the hottest guy in the room finally relenting to accept the feelings of a girl who throws herself at him. All of what I've written is only relevant to fanfiction because Naruto has never been a romance and if Sasuke and Hinata had gotten together in canon we wouldn't have seen the plot of it anyway. \n\nBut in terms of considering how the actual characters would work together as people and not plot devices: they have the shared similarities to build off, I could see them finding shared ground post-699 in their respect and admiration for Naruto, and then from there finding out how similar their family lives were before Sasuke lost him. Then there's Hinata's shy and anxious personality in contrast to Sasuke's closed off and kinda angry demeanor. \n\nEither they're going to smooth each other out and improve their worst flaws (Hinata's kindness will help Sasuke open up and calm down, and Sasuke's no-bullshit attitude will lead Hinata by example as she was with Naruto's tenacity) OR they will clash and make each of their personality flaws so much worse (Hinata's nervousness will put Sasuke on the defensive and set off his anger, which worsens Hinata's nerves, which makes Sasuke angrier, which makes Hinata more nervous... and so on) or OR they worsen each other when they first meet and after repeat exposure they're finally able to improve each other. I'm reaching into fanfiction territory again tho. \n\nBut yeah, that's the fucking unhinged rambling of someone who's shipped this for longer than many Naruto fans have even been alive. Hope whoever read this got something out of it.",

Kakashi has convinced himself that if he lets anyone close to him, they'll die, and concludes he needs to keep people at length. And so a \"rival\" Gai can only ever be to Kakashi. Kakashi convinces himself he won't be completely crushed if it's just his rival that kicks it, and he's wrong, but he never finds that out. \n\nIf they're ever intimate it's always couched as part of the rivalry.

I mean it matters to me that Kakashi is into Gai bc I'm queer and starved for representation (especially from a nostalgic property like Naruto), but what does Kakashi being queer take away from you?\n\nWhy are you so invested in Kakashi being straight you need to \"well, actually...\" this?",

Strained relationships with their neglectful fathers, being weaker than their older brothers that keep distance from them (and in Hinata's case her older brother and younger sister) anxiety to live up to their clan's prestige. The biggest difference between them is the we know Sasuke had a loving mother, while we don't know if Hinata's mom was even alive or not. I think if the massacre never happened, Sasuke would be pretty similar to Hinata in terms of thoughts of self worth and tenacity towards improvement, I bet he, like Hinata, would've found inspiration in Naruto. \n\n(By the way I am totally not normal about Naruto marrying basically Sasuke pre-trauma. I mean Hinata even *looks* similar to Sasuke, with the dark bluish hair and pale skin and affinity for wearing lavender and also having an ocular kekkei genkai. Gdi Naruto why didn't you just marry Sasuke??)\n\nAnd then for Sasuke and Hinata as a potential relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to admit the *entire reason* I showed interest in this ship was because when I was reading the chunin exams arch as a freaking thirteen year old, I noticed that Hinata was literally the *only* girl Sasuke's age who didn't have a positive thought about him. I thought it would be the fucking funniest thing in the world if Sasuke was interested in the only girl that didn't give a shit about him. The hottest guy in the room actually having to work to impress a girl instead is a way more compelling narrative to me than the hottest guy in the room finally relenting to accept the feelings of a girl who throws herself at him. All of what I've written is only relevant to fanfiction because Naruto has never been a romance and if Sasuke and Hinata had gotten together in canon we wouldn't have seen the plot of it anyway. \n\nBut in terms of considering how the actual characters would work together as people and not plot devices: they have the shared similarities to build off, I could see them finding shared ground post-699 in their respect and admiration for Naruto, and then from there finding out how similar their family lives were before Sasuke lost him. Then there's Hinata's shy and anxious personality in contrast to Sasuke's closed off and kinda angry demeanor. \n\nEither they're going to smooth each other out and improve their worst flaws (Hinata's kindness will help Sasuke open up and calm down, and Sasuke's no-bullshit attitude will lead Hinata by example as she was with Naruto's tenacity) OR they will clash and make each of their personality flaws so much worse (Hinata's nervousness will put Sasuke on the defensive and set off his anger, which worsens Hinata's nerves, which makes Sasuke angrier, which makes Hinata more nervous... and so on) or OR they worsen each other when they first meet and after repeat exposure they're finally able to improve each other. I'm reaching into fanfiction territory again tho. \n\nBut yeah, that's the fucking unhinged rambling of someone who's shipped this for longer than many Naruto fans have even been alive. Hope whoever read this got something out of it.",

Kakashi has convinced himself that if he lets anyone close to him, they'll die, and concludes he needs to keep people at length. And so a \"rival\" Gai can only ever be to Kakashi. Kakashi convinces himself he won't be completely crushed if it's just his rival that kicks it, and he's wrong, but he never finds that out. \n\nIf they're ever intimate it's always couched as part of the rivalry.

                            "body": "Yeah, I'm gonna just show my cards on how unhinged I am about sasuke and hinata because I'm in a Mood. \n\nHinata's childhood is very similar to how Sasuke's was pre-massacre. Strained relationships with their neglectful fathers, being weaker than their older brothers that keep distance from them (and in Hinata's case her older brother and younger sister) anxiety to live up to their clan's prestige. The biggest difference between them is the we know Sasuke had a loving mother, while we don't know if Hinata's mom was even alive or not. I think if the massacre never happened, Sasuke would be pretty similar to Hinata in terms of thoughts of self worth and tenacity towards improvement, I bet he, like Hinata, would've found inspiration in Naruto. \n\n(By the way I am totally not normal about Naruto marrying basically Sasuke pre-trauma. I mean Hinata even *looks* similar to Sasuke, with the dark bluish hair and pale skin and affinity for wearing lavender and also having an ocular kekkei genkai. Gdi Naruto why didn't you just marry Sasuke??)\n\nAnd then for Sasuke and Hinata as a potential relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to admit the *entire reason* I showed interest in this ship was because when I was reading the chunin exams arch as a freaking thirteen year old, I noticed that Hinata was literally the *only* girl Sasuke's age who didn't have a positive thought about him. I thought it would be the fucking funniest thing in the world if Sasuke was interested in the only girl that didn't give a shit about him. The hottest guy in the room actually having to work to impress a girl instead is a way more compelling narrative to me than the hottest guy in the room finally relenting to accept the feelings of a girl who throws herself at him. All of what I've written is only relevant to fanfiction because Naruto has never been a romance and if Sasuke and Hinata had gotten together in canon we wouldn't have seen the plot of it anyway. \n\nBut in terms of considering how the actual characters would work together as people and not plot devices: they have the shared similarities to build off, I could see them finding shared ground post-699 in their respect and admiration for Naruto, and then from there finding out how similar their family lives were before Sasuke lost him. Then there's Hinata's shy and anxious personality in contrast to Sasuke's closed off and kinda angry demeanor. \n\nEither they're going to smooth each other out and improve their worst flaws (Hinata's kindness will help Sasuke open up and calm down, and Sasuke's no-bullshit attitude will lead Hinata by example as she was with Naruto's tenacity) OR they will clash and make each of their personality flaws so much worse (Hinata's nervousness will put Sasuke on the defensive and set off his anger, which worsens Hinata's nerves, which makes Sasuke angrier, which makes Hinata more nervous... and so on) or OR they worsen each other when they first meet and after repeat exposure they're finally able to improve each other. I'm reaching into fanfiction territory again tho. \n\nBut yeah, that's the fucking unhinged rambling of someone who's shipped this for longer than many Naruto fans have even been alive. Hope whoever read this got something out of it.",

                    "body": "Yeah, I'm gonna just show my cards on how unhinged I am about sasuke and hinata because I'm in a Mood. \n\nHinata's childhood is very similar to how Sasuke's was pre-massacre. Strained relationships with their neglectful fathers, being weaker than their older brothers that keep distance from them (and in Hinata's case her older brother and younger sister) anxiety to live up to their clan's prestige. The biggest difference between them is the we know Sasuke had a loving mother, while we don't know if Hinata's mom was even alive or not. I think if the massacre never happened, Sasuke would be pretty similar to Hinata in terms of thoughts of self worth and tenacity towards improvement, I bet he, like Hinata, would've found inspiration in Naruto. \n\n(By the way I am totally not normal about Naruto marrying basically Sasuke pre-trauma. I mean Hinata even *looks* similar to Sasuke, with the dark bluish hair and pale skin and affinity for wearing lavender and also having an ocular kekkei genkai. Gdi Naruto why didn't you just marry Sasuke??)\n\nAnd then for Sasuke and Hinata as a potential relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to admit the *entire reason* I showed interest in this ship was because when I was reading the chunin exams arch as a freaking thirteen year old, I noticed that Hinata was literally the *only* girl Sasuke's age who didn't have a positive thought about him. I thought it would be the fucking funniest thing in the world if Sasuke was interested in the only girl that didn't give a shit about him. The hottest guy in the room actually having to work to impress a girl instead is a way more compelling narrative to me than the hottest guy in the room finally relenting to accept the feelings of a girl who throws herself at him. All of what I've written is only relevant to fanfiction because Naruto has never been a romance and if Sasuke and Hinata had gotten together in canon we wouldn't have seen the plot of it anyway. \n\nBut in terms of considering how the actual characters would work together as people and not plot devices: they have the shared similarities to build off, I could see them finding shared ground post-699 in their respect and admiration for Naruto, and then from there finding out how similar their family lives were before Sasuke lost him. Then there's Hinata's shy and anxious personality in contrast to Sasuke's closed off and kinda angry demeanor. \n\nEither they're going to smooth each other out and improve their worst flaws (Hinata's kindness will help Sasuke open up and calm down, and Sasuke's no-bullshit attitude will lead Hinata by example as she was with Naruto's tenacity) OR they will clash and make each of their personality flaws so much worse (Hinata's nervousness will put Sasuke on the defensive and set off his anger, which worsens Hinata's nerves, which makes Sasuke angrier, which makes Hinata more nervous... and so on) or OR they worsen each other when they first meet and after repeat exposure they're finally able to improve each other. I'm reaching into fanfiction territory again tho. \n\nBut yeah, that's the fucking unhinged rambling of someone who's shipped this for longer than many Naruto fans have even been alive. Hope whoever read this got something out of it.",

            "body": "Yeah, I'm gonna just show my cards on how unhinged I am about sasuke and hinata because I'm in a Mood. \n\nHinata's childhood is very similar to how Sasuke's was pre-massacre. Strained relationships with their neglectful fathers, being weaker than their older brothers that keep distance from them (and in Hinata's case her older brother and younger sister) anxiety to live up to their clan's prestige. The biggest difference between them is the we know Sasuke had a loving mother, while we don't know if Hinata's mom was even alive or not. I think if the massacre never happened, Sasuke would be pretty similar to Hinata in terms of thoughts of self worth and tenacity towards improvement, I bet he, like Hinata, would've found inspiration in Naruto. \n\n(By the way I am totally not normal about Naruto marrying basically Sasuke pre-trauma. I mean Hinata even *looks* similar to Sasuke, with the dark bluish hair and pale skin and affinity for wearing lavender and also having an ocular kekkei genkai. Gdi Naruto why didn't you just marry Sasuke??)\n\nAnd then for Sasuke and Hinata as a potential relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to admit the *entire reason* I showed interest in this ship was because when I was reading the chunin exams arch as a freaking thirteen year old, I noticed that Hinata was literally the *only* girl Sasuke's age who didn't have a positive thought about him. I thought it would be the fucking funniest thing in the world if Sasuke was interested in the only girl that didn't give a shit about him. The hottest guy in the room actually having to work to impress a girl instead is a way more compelling narrative to me than the hottest guy in the room finally relenting to accept the feelings of a girl who throws herself at him. All of what I've written is only relevant to fanfiction because Naruto has never been a romance and if Sasuke and Hinata had gotten together in canon we wouldn't have seen the plot of it anyway. \n\nBut in terms of considering how the actual characters would work together as people and not plot devices: they have the shared similarities to build off, I could see them finding shared ground post-699 in their respect and admiration for Naruto, and then from there finding out how similar their family lives were before Sasuke lost him. Then there's Hinata's shy and anxious personality in contrast to Sasuke's closed off and kinda angry demeanor. \n\nEither they're going to smooth each other out and improve their worst flaws (Hinata's kindness will help Sasuke open up and calm down, and Sasuke's no-bullshit attitude will lead Hinata by example as she was with Naruto's tenacity) OR they will clash and make each of their personality flaws so much worse (Hinata's nervousness will put Sasuke on the defensive and set off his anger, which worsens Hinata's nerves, which makes Sasuke angrier, which makes Hinata more nervous... and so on) or OR they worsen each other when they first meet and after repeat exposure they're finally able to improve each other. I'm reaching into fanfiction territory again tho. \n\nBut yeah, that's the fucking unhinged rambling of someone who's shipped this for longer than many Naruto fans have even been alive. Hope whoever read this got something out of it.",
