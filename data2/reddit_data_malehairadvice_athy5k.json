The ones you found are nice, but the solid black is a bit intense with your pale skin tone and they are a little sporty for daily wear (although they go great with that jersey). Try some thick rims in dark brown or turtleshell. Warby Parker is a really great option. Cheap frames and lenses, lots of options, excellent online ordering/try-on and customer service. \n\nThe shape of these is much better. I like a taller frame on your face. \n\nYour old frames don't suit your face and are out of style. Given that they're effectively part of your face when people look at you, spend a few extra bucks to get a good pair that you're proud to wear. ",

The ones you found are nice, but the solid black is a bit intense with your pale skin tone and they are a little sporty for daily wear (although they go great with that jersey). Try some thick rims in dark brown or turtleshell. Warby Parker is a really great option. Cheap frames and lenses, lots of options, excellent online ordering/try-on and customer service. \n\nThe shape of these is much better. I like a taller frame on your face. \n\nYour old frames don't suit your face and are out of style.
